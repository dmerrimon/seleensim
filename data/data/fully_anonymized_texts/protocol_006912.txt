 Additionally, a protocol clarification letter (Protocol Clarification Letter #2.1, 27 March 
2020) was issued to outline modifications that could be made to study conduct due to 
COVID-19.  The main reasons for the Protocol Clarification Letter were as follows: 
1. To detail the modifications to study conduct and site monitoring to be implemented 
during the global COVID-19 pandemic.  Modifications are allowed to informed 
consent process; visit schedule and on-site study visits; collection of clinical 
laboratory assessments, weight, vital signs, efficacy assessments, adverse events 
and concomitant medications; dispense, return, and review of subject diaries; 
investigational product dispensing, administration, and compliance measurement; 
recording of COVID-19-related protocol deviations; transition to vamorolone 
general access program; and site monitoring.  The key modifications to be made on a visit-, site-, or subject-specific basis are: 
a. to allow for scheduled assessments to be performed remotely, with the 
exception of Screening assessments, which must be performed at the study 
site; 
b. for critical safety assessments (i.e., clinical laboratory tests, collection of 
adverse events and concomitant medications), intervals between assessments should be no longer than 12 weeks; 
c. in cases where on-site study visits are not possible for the completion of 
scheduled efficacy assessments, the Time to Stand Test (TTSTAND) will

Study Design This Phase IIb study is a randomized, double -blind, parallel group, placebo and 
active- controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety,  PD, and population PK  of 
vamorolone administered orally at daily doses of 2.0 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg  
versus prednisone  0.75 mg/kg/day and placebo over a Treatment Period  of 
[ADDRESS_570729]  over a Treatment Period of 
48 weeks  in ambulant boys ages 4 to <7 years with DMD.  
The study is comprised of a 5 -week Pretreatment Screening Period, a 1- day 
Pretreatment Baseline Period, a 24 -week Treatment Period  #1 (Week s 1-24), a 
4-week Transition Period (Weeks 25 -28), a 20- week Treatment Period  #2 
(Weeks 28  + 1 day to 48), and a 4 -week Dose- tapering Period (Weeks 49 -52). 
Subjects will be randomized to one of six treatment group s in a 2 :2:1:1:1:1  ratio, 
where the two prednisone groups in Treatment Period  #1 (Groups 3 and 4) will 
be combined and the two placebo groups in Treatment Period #1 (Groups 5 and 
6) will be combined, effectively resulting in a 1:1:1:1  randomization

Subjects will be stratified based on age at study entry (<6 vs. ≥ 6 years).  During 
the 4 -week Transition Period between Treatment Period #1 and Treatment 
Period #2, all subjects will continue on the same oral suspension (vamorolone 
2.0 mg/kg or 6.0 mg/kg, or matching placebo) they received during  Treatment

Page 10 of 232 
ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  subjects randomized to receive vamorolone during Treatment Period  #1 (Groups 
1 and 2) will continue to receive vamorolone at the same dose, while subjects 
randomized to receive prednisone will have the ir dose tapered to zero, and 
subjects randomized to placebo will continue to receive placebo.  
The prednisone group will be used as an active control comparison for safety and efficacy endpoints as requested by [CONTACT_3558] (EMA) .  
The plac ebo group will be used as comparator for efficacy endpoints (superiority 
model) as requested by [CONTACT_448458] (FDA ) 
protocol advisory board.  Although glucocorticoids are part of the care recommendations for DMD, their adverse effect profile has limited their use .  
The age at which glucocorticoids should be started  in DMD boys is uncertain, 
ranging from 4 to 7 years, based on a balance between benefits and side effects.  In view of the age inclusion criteria and duration  of the placebo -controlled study  
period (6 months) , the use of a placebo group has been considered acceptable as 
in clinical practice it will not cause a real delay in prescription of an accepted 
treatment for this condition.  Any exposure of placebo longe r than 6 months was 
considered unethical.  
At the end of the Treatment Period #2, subjects may be given access to 
vamorolone through an additional study or general access program, or given the 
option to transition to standard of care treatment for DMD (may include 
glucocorticoids).  Subjects completing VBP15- 004 and enrolling directly into an 
additional vamorolone study or general access program to receive vamorolone 
will not need to taper their vamorolone dose prior to enrollment.  All other subjects will b egin a 4 -week double -blind Dose- tapering Period during which 
the dose of study medication will be progressively reduced and discontinued.  
Planned Sample 
Size A total of approximately 120 subjects will be randomized (2:2:1:1:1:1) to 
treatment as follows  (treatment assignment in Treatment Period  #1 ® treatment 
assignment in Treatment Period  #2): 
Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day ® Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day (n=30);  
Vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day ® Vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day (n=30); 
Prednisone 0.75  mg/kg/day ® Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day (n=15);   
Prednisone 0.75  mg/kg/day ® Vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day (n=15);  
Placebo ® Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day (n=15); or  
Placebo ® Vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day (n=15) . 
Inclusion Criteria  1. Subject’s parent (s) or legal guardian (s) has (have) provided written 
informed consent  and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) authorization, where applicable, prior to any study -related 
procedures; participants will be asked to give written or verbal assent

In the vamorolone VBP15 -003 study and the interim analysis of the VBP15 -LTE 
study, doses of 0.25 and 0.75  mg/kg/day showed little evidence of clinical 
benefit, whereas doses of 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/day both showed clear evidence of 
clinical benefit comparable to that seen with glucocorticoids (prednisone and deflazacort).  
In consideration of the primary efficacy  endpoint in the current study , 
comparison of 6.0 mg/kg/day vamorolone versus placebo, sample size calculations were performed using data from vamorolone -treated subjects from 
the VBP15 -002/VBP15- 003 24- week treatment period.  The analysis compared 
TTSTAND velocity from the combined 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/day groups (Treatment  Group) to the combined 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups ( Pseudo -
Placebo G roup).   
Least squares (LS)  means from the mixed model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) modeling of VBP15 -002/VBP15- 003 24- week data were used as 
parameter estimates of the population means in the sample size calculations for the comparison of the Treatment Group (2.0 + 6.0 mg/kg/day) vs. the Pseudo -
Placebo Group (0.25 + 0.75 mg/kg/day) on the mean change from baselin e at 
Week 24.  For the estimates of standard deviations within each comparison group, simple descriptive statistics from the VBP15 -002/VBP15- 003 24- week 
data were used.  Power was estimated using two -sided t- tests assuming unequal 
variance, with alpha =0.05.  
The following table shows the resultant estimated power for various sample sizes per comparison group for comparing the Treatment Group (2.0 + 6.0 mg/kg/day) vs. the Pseudo-P lacebo Group (0.25 + 0.75 mg/kg/day) on the mean change from 
baseline at Week 24 for the alternative hypothesis that H1: μ1 ≠ μ2 assuming an alpha level of 0.05 and parameter estimates from the analyses described above for TTSTAND velocity:

The sample size of 25 per treatment group for 2 .0 mg/kg/day, 6 .0 mg/kg/day, 
prednisone, and placebo will result in a total  enrollment of 100 subjec ts which 
will provide approximately 85% power at alpha level 0.[ADDRESS_570760] a statistically 
significant difference between 6.0  mg/kg/day and placebo on TTSTAND 
velocity at W eek 24.  Similarly, a total enrollment of 120 subjects (30 per 
treatment group) will provide approximately 91% power at alpha level 0.[ADDRESS_570761] a statistically significant difference between 6 .0 mg/kg/day and placebo 
on TTSTAND velocity at Week 24.  
Note  that subjects in the prednisone and placebo groups will actually be 
randomized into two groups each:  
• Prednisone 0.75  mg/kg/day ® Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day (n=15);  
• Prednisone 0.75  mg/kg/day ® Vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day (n=15);

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  These groups will be pooled by [CONTACT_448462] (prednisone or placebo) for the 
Treatment Period #1 analyses.  
If the number of subjects who withdraw early from the study is h igh, additional 
subjects may be enrolled to achieve approximately 120 subjects completing the Week 24 Visit assessments.  
Analysis Populations:   
Four populations will be defined for data analysis: the Safety Population, the 
modified Intent -to-Treat Population , the Per Protocol Population (PPP), and the 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Population . 
Safety Population  
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication will be included in the Safety Population.  The Safety Population is the primary analysis population for safety and PD assessments.  Results will be presented “as 
treated.”  
Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population  
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication and have at least one post -baseline assessment will be included in the mITT Population.  The 
mITT Population is the primary analysis population for clinical efficacy.   
Subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication but never have post -
baseline assessments will be excluded.  Results will be presented “as randomized.”  
Per Protocol Population  
The PPP will be those subjects in the mITT Population who had no major protocol deviations and will be the secondary analysis population for analysis of the efficacy data.  The PPP will also exclude some subjects because of missed 
assessments due to the CO VID- [ADDRESS_570763] lock . 
 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Population  
All subjects who receive at least one dose of vamorolone study medication and 
have sufficient data for PK analysis will be included in the PK Population.  
General Statistical Considerations:   
All measurements will be analyzed based upon the type of distribution and descriptive statistics presented by [CONTACT_11571], as appropriate.  No formal interim statistical analyses are planned, apart from the interim unblinded safety data views and presentations to be created for the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  The Week [ADDRESS_570764] completed Week 24 of Treatment Period #1.  The Week 48 analyses (vamorolone versus 
untreated historical controls and vamorolone versus prednisone -treated historical 
controls) will be performed after all subjects have completed Treatment 
Period # 2.  Missing values for safety outcomes will be treated as missing, unless 
stated otherwise.   
Baseline measurement is defined as the last non- missing value prior to the first 
dose of study drug.  
Treatment Period # 1 analyses will be summarized by [CONTACT_448463]:  
• Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day (n=30);  
• Vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day (n=30);

Treatment Period #2 analyses (besides historical control comparison data) will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_448464]:  
• Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day ® Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day (n=30);  
• Vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day ® Vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day (n=30);  
• Prednisone 0.75  mg/kg/day ® Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day (n=15);  
• Prednisone 0.75  mg/kg/day ® Vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day (n=15);  
• Placebo ® Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day (n=15); and  
• Placebo ® Vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day (n=15).  
Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons:  
The primary efficacy endpoint tests vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day vs. placebo using 
TTSTAND velocity at Week 24 and  occur s during Treatment Period #1 of the 
study.  The primary efficacy endpoint supports  the primary objective of this 
study.  The study is thus powered for t he efficacy comparison  using an alpha 
level of 0.05 for success .   
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested at Week 24 along with the primary efficacy endpoint using a fixed sequential testing process where the fixed sequence of testing will be done  in the following order:  
1. TTSTAND velocity, vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day vs placebo  
2. [ADDRESS_570766] (6MWT) meters walked, vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day vs. placebo  
3. [ADDRESS_570767] (6MWT) meters walked, vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day vs. placebo  
4. Time to Run/Walk (TTR W) 10 meters velocity, vamorolone 6.0 
mg/kg/day vs. placebo  
5. Time to Run/Walk (TTRW) 10 meters velocity, vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day vs. placebo  
6. 6MWT meters walked, vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day vs. prednisone  
7. 6MWT meters walked, vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day vs. prednisone  
Each test in the sequence will be carried out using a two -sided alpha level of 
0.05.  Statistical testing of the primary/secondary efficacy endpoints will stop if 
a p-value >0.05 occurs or if a p -value ≤
 0.05 occurs in the wrong direction.  In 
case the fixed sequential testing process stops, the results of the subsequent tests 
will be reported with nominal p- values, but p -values ≤ 0.05 in the right direction 
will not be considered proof of statistical testing success in these subsequent tests.  
All other analyses will not be corrected for multiple comparisons  (tests will be 
performed at the 0.05 alpha level) , as they will be viewed and handled in the 
perspective of not testing a formal hypothesis.  
Efficacy Analyses:  
All evaluations of clinical efficacy will be listed and presented using descriptive 
statistics per treatment group and time point.  The primary efficacy outcome is TTSTAND (velocity) , comparison of vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day vs placebo.  
Secondary and exploratory efficacy outcomes are TTSTAND (velocity) , 
comparison of vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day vs placebo ; the NSAA assessment ; 
TTCLIMB (velocity) ; TTRW  (velocity) ; 6MWT ; hand- held myometry (elbow 
flexors and knee extensors) ; and ROM .

mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM).  This model includes fixed 
effects for treatment  (vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day, vamorolone 6.0  mg/kg/day, 
prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day, and placebo),  week, baseline TTSTAND, age group 
(per stratification), and the treatment -by-week interaction.  Study week will be 
included in the model as a categorical v ariable (Weeks 6, 12, and 24) along with 
the treatment- by-week interaction.  Within this model, pairwise comparisons 
(using least squares [LS] mean contrasts) will be made to compare TTSTAND  
velocity at 24 weeks for the vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day dose level with placebo 
(primary efficacy outcome) .  
For secondary outcomes, the same models will be used as for the primary outcome (REML -based MMRM including fixed effects for treatment 
[vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day, vamorolone 6.0  mg/kg/day, p rednisone 0.75 
mg/kg/day, and placebo] , age group [<6 years; ≥ 6 years], week, baseline, and 
treatment- by-week interaction ). 
An unstructured covariance matrix will be used, and underlying modelling assumptions will be checked.  If differences between baseline characteristics exist between the treatment groups, it will be investigated if adjustment for these characteristics is clinically relevant and necessary.  The secondary outcome measures will be compared using similar models.  
Sensitivity analyses will b e performed to assess the impact of COVID -19 on the 
primary endpoint.  Additional sensitivity and supportive analyses will be performed on the primary and secondary outcomes .  Full details will be provided 
in the SAP.  
Subjects who are randomized to receive  vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day or 
vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day for both treatment periods will have TTSTAND velocity change from baseline data captured over 48 weeks compared with untreated DMD historical control data.  Full details will be provided in the Statisti cal Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
Patient Reported Outcome Analyses:  
Patient Reported Outcomes including the TSQM, PODCI, PARS III, Ease of 
Study Medication Administration Assessment, and the Blindedness Assessment will be listed and presented using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_12268].  In addition, compariso n will be made for each vamorolone dose group 
with placebo for the PODCI and for each vamorolone dose group with prednisone and placebo for the PARS  III, with p values computed for the 
comparisons.   Full details will be provided in the SAP.  
Safety Analyses : 
All evaluations of clinical safety will be listed and presented using descriptive statistics per treatment group and time point.  For the safety analyses during 
Treatment Period #1, the vamorolone dose  levels will be compared to 
prednisone , as specified in the SAP.   
Safety data will include BMI, weight, vital signs, 2D -echocardiogram, DXA 
scan, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] x -ray, eye examination results, ACTH Stimulation T est results, and 
ECG results, and these will be presented using descriptive statistics.   Safety 
laboratory data will be summarized using descriptive statistics, and out -of-range 
values will be listed.  Adverse events will be summarized overall and by

In Treatment Period #1, BMI z-score change from baseline results will be 
compared between treatment groups using an REML -based MMRM analysis 
with treatment group, week of the visit, and the treatment -by-week interaction as 
factors, and baseline BMI z-score and age group as a covariate.  Week will be 
included in the model as a categorical variable (Week 12 and 24) along with the 
treatment- by-week interaction.  An unstructured within -subject covariance 
matrix will be used.  If this analysis fails to converge, Akaike’s information criteri on will be used to select the best covariance structure from compound 
symmetry and autoregressive -1 (AR(1)).  The Kenward -Roger approximation 
will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom.  
Change from baseline in all continuous clinical laborator y test results will be 
tested using one sample t -tests with p -values presented along with the descriptive 
statistics at each assessment visit within each treatment group.  
Pharmacodynamics Analyses:  
Serum PD biomarkers of adrenal axis suppression, insulin r esistance, and bone 
turnover will be assessed.  PD biomarkers will be analyzed using MMRMs 
similar to the primary efficacy model.  Plots will be created.  Additional exploratory PD biomarkers of both safety and efficacy may be assessed.  
Vamorolone -treated  groups will be compared to both prednisone -treated and 
placebo groups.

1.1 Background and Unmet Need 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_120680].  Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects approximately [ADDRESS_570794] partially mediated by 
[CONTACT_120742]-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation, are 
evident during early disease stages and play a significant role in muscle wasting.[ADDRESS_570795] been made in understanding the etiology of DMD, a 
cure has not been found, and until recently treatment options were medications used “off-
label” to alleviate the symptoms of DMD.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120681], only 
glucocorticoids, such as prednisone or deflazacort, have consistently demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials.
10  Indeed, the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (US 
FDA) recently approved deflazacort as a treatment for DMD.  Further, many disease 
modifying technologies that are currently in development focus on subsets of dystrophin 
mutations and therefore do not address the unmet need in all persons with DMD.  However, it is likely that glucocorticoids will need to be co-administered with many of

profiles, often limiting long-term administration.  The current goal of DMD research is to 
find a mutation-independent treatment that matches or exceeds the efficacy of 
glucocorticoids with a significantly lower side effect profile. 
Vamorolone is a first generation delta-9, [ADDRESS_570797] developed countries, or even earlier in some cases.  
The significant effects of glucocorticoids on growth and development, however, prevent 
their routine administration in infancy or ‘toddler’ years, despi[INVESTIGATOR_448427], the better the overall functional outcome.

boys at a younger age than when glucocorticoid treatment is currently initiated.  In 
addition, vamorolone could be prescribed in later stage non-ambulant young men with 
DMD and for a longer period of time, where the risk:benefit balance of glucocorticoids is often less favorable. 
Efficacy may also be improved over classic glucocorticoids in the longer term.  In 
addition to the anti-inflammatory properties of vamorolone as a result of NF- kB pathway 
inhibition, vamorolone may also improve efficacy over conventional glucocorticoids due 
to the lack of interference in the AKT1/FOXO pathway, a key feature of glucocorticoid therapy which leads in the long term to muscle wasting and atrophy.

Potentially, the administration of vamorolone to a DMD patient may begin soon after 
birth to slow the dystrophic process of muscle, retaining regenerative capacity and 
substantially improving patient quality of life. 
1.2 Nonclinical Experience 
The safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK) and metabolism, and toxicology of 
vamorolone have been evaluated in multiple nonclinical studies in vitro and in mice, rats, 
beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys in vivo. 
All Good Clinical Laboratory (GLP) studies were conducted in, or inspected by, a 
country that has implemented the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) system.

In normal, male CD-1® mice, these effects were reproduced.  Unlike CD-[ADDRESS_570802]

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is associated with cardiomyopathy that can become life 
threatening, and increased fibrosis with predniso lone treatment in heart muscle of the 
mdx mouse has been reported.24  Histologically, clear fibrosis was evident in 50% of 
young (8-week) prednisolone-treated mouse hearts compared to no incidence of fibrosis 
identified in the other groups (wild type; mdx vehicle, and vamorolone-treated). 
Pharmacologically, glucocorticoids show immunosuppressive and immunotoxic properties that limit therapeutic windows and long-term use.  Vamorolone (5, 15, 30 mg/kg/day) was benchmarked against prednisolone (5 mg/kg/day) to determine if similar properties were observed.
15  Untreated mdx mice showed increased numbers of 
peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and enlarged spleens resulting from ongoing muscle damage compared to wild type mice.  Vamorolone treatment reduced spleen mass and PBL counts in a dose-dependent manner.  This finding is attributed to a reduction in

immunosuppressive and/or immunotoxic properties.  Further, prednisolone significantly 
decreased viable splenocytes per gram of tissue (p <0.005), whereas this decrease was not 
observed for any vamorolone dose tested (ReveraGen Report No. 
MDX-RBP-VBP15-02).15 
To further query the potential immune modulation, the effects of vamorolone and 
prednisolone on counts of splenic B and T-lymphocytes isolated from treated mdx mice 
were examined.  CD4+ T-cell activation was assayed by [CONTACT_448469] T-cell mitogen, concanavalin A (ConA).  Splenocytes obtained from prednisolone-treated mice displayed a significant reduction of the percentage of splenic activated 
CD4+CD25+ T-cells upon ConA stimulation while splenocytes derived from 
vamorolone-treated mice did not (ReveraGen Report No. MDX-RBP-VBP15-02). 
Taken together, these findings suggest that while prednisolone treatment leads to a 
reduction in T-cell number and activation status, vamorolone modulates inflamed mdx 
immune systems towards a wild type state without compromising T-cell activation status. 
1.2.2 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism 
Single Dose Vamorolone PK profiles were determined in male CD-1 mice, Sprague Dawley rats and 
beagle dogs after a single intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg and after a single oral dose 
of 50 mg/kg in mice and rats and 30 mg/kg in dogs. 
Pharmacokinetic results for vamorolone following a single intravenous administration of 
10 mg/kg in Crl:CD1(ICR) mice demonstrated a clearance (CL) of 18.8 mL/min/kg.  The terminal half-life (t
½) was 0.35 hours.  Volume of distribution at steady state (V ss) was 
0.76 L/kg.  Following oral administration of 50 mg/kg in mice, the maximum observed plasma concentration (C
max) of 6787 ng/mL was observed at 2 hours (time to maximum 
observed plasma concentration [T max]) after drug administration, and percent 
bioavailability (F%) was 74.5%.  Following oral administration of 15 mg/kg via cherry

bioavailability was 47.7% (ReveraGen Report No. PH-DPMK-VBP-10-004). 
Pharmacokinetic results for vamorolone following a single intravenous administration of 
50 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats indicated a CL of 20.2 mL/min/kg. The t ½ was 
0.58 hours.  V ss was 0.77 L/kg, which was similar to that observed in mice.  After oral 
administration of 50 mg/kg in rats, a C max of 2543 ng/mL was observed at 4 hours after 
dose administration, and bioavailability was 47.8% (ReveraGen Report No. PH-DPMK-VBP-10-007). 
In beagle dogs, vamorolone had a CL of 24.7 mL/min/kg.  The t
½ was 5.42 hours and V ss 
was 1.93 L/kg.  After oral administration of 30 mg/kg in dogs, a C max of 814 ng/mL was 
observed at 6 hours after dose administration and bioavailability was 53.2% (ReveraGen 
Report No. [ZIP_CODE]-10-464). 
Vamorolone clearance was therefore comparable in all 3 species studied 
(19-25 mL/min/kg).  Bioavailability ranged from approximately 50% in mouse (cherry 
syrup), rat, and dog to 75% in the mouse (30% Labrafil) (ReveraGen Report Nos. 
PH-DPMK-VBP-10-004, PH-DPMK-VBP-10-007, [ZIP_CODE]-10-464). 
Multiple Dose Crl:CD1(ICR) mice were administered vamorolone or vehicle once daily (QD) for 
28 consecutive days.  Vamorolone exposure (as assessed by [CONTACT_941] C
max and area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve from time [ADDRESS_570805] observed measurable 
concentration [AUC last]) increased with increasing dose on Study Days [ADDRESS_570806] values in the 30 and 100 mg/kg dose groups compared to 
Day 1, indicating possible enzyme induction.  On Study Day 28, mean AUC last values 
were 1.81-fold and 5.02-fold lower compared to Study Day 1 for the 30 and 100 mg/kg 
dose groups, respectively.  The observed difference in exposure relative to Day 1 
increased with the increase in administered dose of vamorolone (ReveraGen Report No. 
1998-009).

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  Beagle dogs were either administered vamorolone or vehicle QD for 28 consecutive days.  
Vamorolone exposure in dogs (as assessed by C max and AUC last) generally increased with 
increasing dose on Study Days 1 and 28.  For the 2 and 10 mg/kg dose groups, exposure on Day [ADDRESS_570808] values were 
2.35-fold and 2.43-fold (males) and 3.03-fold and 3.23-fold (females) higher compared to 
Study Day 1 for the 2 and 10 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively.  For the 50 mg/kg 
dose group, exposure on Day 28 was similar to that on Day 1.  At the 50 mg/kg dose, AUC
last values in males were 1.71-fold lower whereas females were 1.22 higher on 
Day 28 compared to Day 1 (ReveraGen Report No. 031302). 
Beagle dogs were administered vehicle or vamorolone at doses of 2 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day, or 50 mg/kg/day for 39 weeks.  Systemic exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours [AUC
0-24hr]) to vamorolone appeared to 
be independent of sex.  Mean AUC 0-24hr and C max values for vamorolone increased with 
increasing dose in an approximately dose proportional manner on Days 1 and 270.  Mean systemic exposure (AUC
0-24hr) to vamorolone appeared to increase following repeated 
administration of vamorolone.  Due to the alterations in the feeding regimen, changes in systemic exposure following repeated administration should be viewed with caution due 
the influence of feeding on exposure.  For the 2 and 10 mg/kg/day dose groups, exposure 
on Day 270 was generally higher than on Day 1, indicating possible inhibition of metabolism of vamorolone at these dose levels.  On Day 270, mean AUC
0-24hr values 
were 2.34-fold and 2.98-fold higher compared to Study Day 1 for the 2 and 10 mg/kg/day 
dose groups, respectively.  For the 50 mg/kg dose group, exposure on Day 270 was 
2.07-fold higher compared to that on Day 1 (ReveraGen Report No. 1998-014). 
Non-naïve cynomolgus monkeys were administered vamorolone (300 and 
600 mg/kg/day) or vehicle once daily for 7 consecutive days.  Vamorolone exposure (as 
assessed by C max and AUC last) generally increased with increasing dose on Study Days 1 
and 7 with the exception of male monkeys on Day 7, which showed no clear increase in 
exposure between the 300 and 600 mg/kg/day dose levels.  Repeated dosing over the

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  7-day study duration was associated with decreases in mean plasma vamorolone AUC last 
values for female and male monkeys indicating possible metabolic induction.  On Day 7, 
mean AUC last values were 1.60-fold, 2.19-fold, and 2.02-fold lower in females and 
1.20-fold, 2.09-fold, and 2.88-fold lower in males compared to Study Day 1 for the 100, 
300 and 600 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively (ReveraGen Report Nos. 1998-001, SW11-0418). 
Distribution 
In the plasma protein binding studies, percent bound was similar in human and mouse 
cells in culture (88.06% and 86.71%, respectively).  In the blood partition experiment done ex vivo, the blood to plasma ratio was similar between human and mouse (0.87 and 
0.68, respectively), but the red blood cell to plasma ratio for the mouse (0.33) was less 
than half that of the human (0.74).  Human in vivo data are presented in Section 1.3 (VBP15-001).  In the blood/brain concentration mouse experiment in vivo, the plasma 
concentrations of vamorolone were higher than brain concentrations with the area under 
the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and C
max approximately 2-fold higher in 
plasma than in brain (ReveraGen Report Nos. ADME-NCG-PPB-NC135, ADME-VBP-
PPB-V002, ADME-NCG-BP-NC134, NCATS 2013-38). 
Metabolism 
The in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that vamorolone can be metabolized via 
multiple metabolic pathways, including glucuronidation, hydroxylation, and reduction.  Glucuronidation appeared to be the major metabolic pathway in human cells in vitro.  All 
metabolites observed in human in vitro were observed in monkey in vitro.  Most human 
metabolites identified in vitro were also found in mouse and dog.  Thus, there is no 
unique human metabolite identified for vamorolone. 
The metabolic stability of vamorolone was assessed in non-Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) studies.  Based on the data generated, vamorolone was highly stable for up to 
60 minutes in human, monkey, dog, and mouse liver microsomes in the presence or 
absence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and stable for up to [ADDRESS_570810] 2020

that rat was a high metabolizer of vamorolone relative to other species (mouse, dog, 
human) (ReveraGen Report Nos. NIH-R2526, and ADME-VBP-LM-V003). 
Vamorolone did not significantly inhibit any of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 
isoforms tested (CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4).  Vamorolone moderately induced CYP3A4 (24% to 42%), indicating that vamorolone is a potential 
inducer of CYP3A4 (ReveraGen Report Nos. ADME-VBP-Inhibition-V005, ADME-
VBP-Induction-V006, ADME-VBP-Induction-V009). 
Excretion Vamorolone showed high plasma clearance in rats but, consistent with the extensive 
metabolism in hepatocytes from this species, the biliary and urinary excretion of the 
parent compound was low with an average of <0.05% of the dose recovered in bile and approximately 0.1% in urine.  Overall, vamorolone showed high plasma clearance and extremely low biliary and urinary excretion (ReveraGen Report No. NCATS 2013-44). 
1.2.3 Toxicology 
Single Dose 
Crl:CD1(ICR) mice were administered vamorolone once via oral gavage at 50, 125, 250, 
and 500 mg/kg and observed for abnormalities.  All animals survived to their scheduled 
termination, and there were no significant abnormalities observed.  However, a slight 
decrease in body weight related to vamorolone was observed in males and females at doses above 125 mg/kg.  A dose dependent decrease in food consumption related to vamorolone was also observed in males and females.  There were no other clinical 
observations (ReveraGen Report No. 1998-002). 
Beagle dogs received single 60, 180, 360, and 750 mg/kg doses of vamorolone using an 
escalation study design with a 4-day washout period between doses.  All animals survived dose escalation.  Clinical signs attributed to vamorolone (750 mg/kg) included 
red discoloration of the ears and face.  This effect occurred within a few hours of dosing 
and was transient.  The highest dose also resulted in increased white blood cell count

eosinophils [male and female]).  At the 360 and 750 mg/kg dose levels, slight elevations 
in albumin were observed.  A mild elevation in cholesterol at the 750 mg/kg (and 
possibly 360 mg/kg) dose level was also observed (ReveraGen Report No. [ZIP_CODE].01.01). 
In cynomolgus monkeys, single oral doses of up to 500 mg/kg were well tolerated with 
no significant clinical observations (ReveraGen Report No. 1998-001). 
Multiple Dose 
Acute Toxicity Studies 
Vamorolone or vehicle was administered to Crl:CD1(ICR) mice QD for 28 consecutive 
days at doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day.  All animals survived to their scheduled 
necropsy with the exception of a female mouse (100 mg/kg/day dose group) that was found dead on Day 16.  The cause of death was considered incidental and attributed to a dosing injury based on the amount of red fluid in the thoracic cavity. 
No effects attributable to vamorolone were observed on clinical observations, food 
consumption, ophthalmic examination, or urinalysis during the study.  A dose-dependent decrease in body weight gain was observed at all doses; however, weight was fully regained during the recovery period.  Adrenal gland weights were variable between 
groups and generally decreased, but without a dose response relationship, and correlated 
microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_448428].  After the 2-week recovery period there was evidence of vacuolar degeneration.  Liver weights were significantly increased at the 100 mg/kg/day dose level.  Hepatocellular 
hypertrophy, increased vacuolation, and necrosis (single cell) were seen in a few male 
mice at 30 mg/kg/day.  There was evidence of lipid and glycogen accumulation.  Serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were higher with associated microscopic hypertrophy/vacuolation/necrosis at 100 mg/kg/day.  Spleen 
weights decreased in a dose-dependent manner and correlated with a decreased number 
of lymphocytes in spleen.  Thymus weights decreased in a dose dependent manner and were associated microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_120684].  Mice had dose-dependent reductions in serum lymphocytes which were significant in the 100 mg/kg dose group.

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  After the recovery period, all parameters returned to normal (untreated) except for 
thymus weights, which were increased. 
Based on the liver-related findings in this study, the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) for vamorolone in mice is 30 mg/kg/day (ReveraGen Report No. 1998-009). 
Vamorolone or vehicle was administered to beagle dogs QD for 28 consecutive days at 
doses of 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day.  All animals survived to their scheduled termination 
and no effect of vamorolone was noted on body weight, body temperature, food 
consumption, ophthalmology, electrocardiography, macroscopic, or urinalysis parameters at necropsy.  A dose-dependent decrease in body weight gain was observed at all doses but weights generally returned to normal during the recovery period. 
Adrenal gland weights decreased which correlated with mild or moderate diffuse bilateral 
atrophy of the adrenal cortex, mild multifocal bilateral vacuolation of the adrenal cortex, increased white blood cell and neutrophil counts, and decreased eosinophil counts.  Liver weights increased in the 50 mg/kg/day dose group, which correlated with diffuse 
hypertrophy and vacuolation and increased levels of alkaline phosphatase and gamma 
glutamyltransferase.  Spleen weights decreased, which correlated with lymphoid depletion.  Thymus weights decreased, which corresponded to diffuse lymphoid depletion.  With the exception of diffuse depletion of lymphocytes in thymus in the 
50 mg/kg group, all abnormal parameters returned to normal during the recovery period. 
The NOAEL was considered by [CONTACT_47990] 10 mg/kg/day.  Although 
reversible, the liver changes were considered adverse at 50 mg/kg/day because the severity score was moderate and the changes were diffuse in nature in all animals treated 
at the high dose.  This is in contrast to the conclusion drawn by [CONTACT_3979], 
who considered the NOAEL to be 50 mg/kg/day due to reversibility following cessation of dosing (ReveraGen Report No. [ZIP_CODE]). 
Non-naive cynomolgus monkeys were administered vamorolone or vehicle QD for 
7 consecutive days at doses of 100, 300, and 600 mg/kg.  All animals survived until the 
end of the study period.  There were effects on clinical observations, food consumption, and urinalysis attributable to vamorolone.

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  There was a dose proportional decrease in body weight gain observed in males and 
females at each dose (up to 11% and 9% respectively) related to vamorolone.  A 
cessation of the body weight loss in treatment was observed during the recovery phase 
but no recovery of body weight lost during the 7 days of dosing was observed. 
At termination there were non-significant increases in red cell mass and decreases in 
lymphocytes (up to 56%) in the 600 mg/kg/day dose group.  However, most individual 
animals, including controls, had decreases in lymphocytes (up to 81%) at termination 
relative to their respective pretest.  They had resolved by [CONTACT_448470]. 
In both sexes receiving ≥ 300 mg/kg/day, there was increased urea nitrogen (up to 141%), 
creatinine (up to 58%), total protein (up to 15%), albumin (up to 11%), globulin (up to 
25%), and/or potassium (up to 39%) with concurrent decreases in sodium (up to 10%) and chloride (up to 10%) relative to controls.  At the recovery interval, the majority of these effects had resolved (ReveraGen Report No. 1998-001). 
Chronic toxicity studies 
26-week chronic toxicity study in mice 
A 26-week chronic toxicity study was carried out in Crl:CD1®(ICR) mice to evaluate the 
reversibility, progression, or delayed appearance of any observed changes following a 
4-week postdose observation period.  Doses of vamorolone tested were 5, 15, and 45 mg/kg/day.  Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical observations, body weight, and food consumption; ophthalmoscopic examinations; and clinical and anatomic pathology.  Toxicokinetic assessment was conducted for the test article. 
There were no vamorolone-related effects on mortality, detailed clinical observations, 
food consumption, ophthalmology, sperm evaluations, or bone lengths (femur or tibia). 
Five test article-treated mice were unscheduled deaths (euthanized in extremis or found 
dead) during the dosing phase. Three of these were considered to be potentially due to 
dosing injury based on microscopic findings in mediastinum, epi[INVESTIGATOR_120685], or lung.  One of these unscheduled deaths was attributed to moderate progressive nephropathy; a

undetermined since there were no major pathologic findings to explain the unscheduled 
death of this animal; there was no target organ toxicity in the mouse.  Target organ 
toxicity was not considered a contributor to the death of these animals and there was no dose-relationship in incidence.  
A vamorolone-related increase in body weight gain was observed relative to controls in 
males (+14%) and females (+23%) at 45 mg/kg/day.  Increases in body weights at 45 mg/kg/day were not considered to be adverse due to the general health of the animals overall.  During the recovery phase, bodyweights in males returned to comparable levels 
with controls, however female body weights remained increased compared to female 
controls.   
Evidence of a minimal to mild vamorolone-related hepatic effects were observed in males 
at ≥ 5 mg/kg/day and females at 45 mg/kg/day, indicated by [CONTACT_448471], alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase activities, 
and/or total bilirubin, as related to microscopic hepatocellular vacuolation, inflammation, and/or necrosis in males at ≥ 15 mg/kg/day and females at 45 mg/kg/day; these changes had generally resolved at recovery collections with the exception of minimal increases in 
alanine aminotransferase activity in females at 45 mg/kg/day, which may have correlated 
to microscopic liver pathology. 
A mild vamorolone-related increase in neutrophil counts was observed in both sexes at 
45 mg/kg/day with concurrent decreases in lymphocyte counts in females at 
45 mg/kg/day consistent with a glucocorticoid-like effect, as related to microscopic lymphoid depletion, although an inflammatory stimulus may have contributed to increases in neutrophil counts, as related to microscopic liver inflammation; these 
changes had generally resolved at recovery collections. 
A mild vamorolone-related decrease in chloride was observed in males at ≥ 5 mg/kg/day 
and females at ≥ 15 mg/kg/day that lacked correlative findings among other study endpoints; resolution for this endpoint could not be determined.

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  A mild vamorolone-related increase in albumin was observed in males at ≥ 5 mg/kg/day 
and females at 45 mg/kg/day with concurrent mild increases in globulin in females at

A minor vamorolone-related alteration in lipid metabolism was observed in both sexes at 
45 mg/kg/day and females at 15 mg/kg/day indicated by [CONTACT_448472]/or 
cholesterol; these changes had resolved at recovery collections. 
Vamorolone-related macroscopic findings occurred in the liver of mice at 45 mg/kg/day.  
Tan discoloration occurred in one female and four males at this dose in the dosing phase.  
This correlated with microvesicular/macrovesicular hepatocyte vacuolation.  There were 
no test article-related macroscopic findings in recovery animals.  
Test article-related microscopic findings occurred in adrenal gland (cortical atrophy- with 
correlating decreases in adrenal weights in females), liver (increased severity of 
centrilobular hypertrophy; hepatocyte vacuolation; hepatocyte vacuolation; and 
inflammation/necrosis), lymphoid tissues (thymus, spleen, mandibular lymph node, mesenteric lymph node, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue [GALT]) skin, and pancreatic islets (minimal to mild hypertrophy).  Observed changes in these tissues are considered 
pharmacologically-mediated and not adverse. 
An increased incidence of decreased anagen hair follicles occurred in mice at 
45 mg/kg/day.  Decreased anagen hair follicles was documented for individual animals 
when there were no anagen hair follicles in the section of skin.  Incidence in controls and 
mice at 5 and 15 mg/kg/day were similar.  A severity score was not given to the decrease as this may have been somewhat dependent on size of skin sample.  This change is not considered adverse. 
There was full reversibility of lymphoid changes in thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph 
node, mandibular lymph node, and GALT.  There were no meaningful differences between treated and controls at the end of the recovery tissues for these lymphoid tissues.  There was recovery of adrenal gland findings in females and partial recovery of adrenal 
gland findings in males.  In addition, there was partial reversibility of liver findings for 
males and females.  Minor changes persisted in the pancreas and skin.

(males > females) and appeared to be independent of sex on Day 179.  Following daily 
administration of vamorolone in females and males, systemic exposure (AUC 0-24hr) and 
Cmax values of vamorolone increased with increasing dose in a greater than dose 
proportional manner on Day 1 and in an approximately dose proportional manner on 
Day 179.  Systemic exposure to vamorolone in females appeared to increase following 
repeated administration of vamorolone at 5 mg/kg, did not appear to change following repeated administration of vamorolone at 15 mg/kg, and appeared to decrease following repeated administration of vamorolone at 45 mg/kg.  Systemic exposure to vamorolone in males appeared to decrease following repeated administration of vamorolone (Table 1).

The once daily administration of vamorolone via oral gavage to mice for 26 weeks at 5, 
15, and 45 mg/kg/day did not produce any adverse effects.  Therefore, the No-
Observable-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) is considered to be 45 mg/kg/day under the conditions of this study. 
As liver is considered a primary target organ, the liver enzymes (aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) of mice in this study were 
studied at study termination (Figure 1).

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  Figure 1 Liver Function Enzymes in GLP Chronic Toxicology Study in Mice 
(26 weeks)  
 
There were no differences between male and female mice regarding liver function 
enzymes.  There were no drug-related elevations of AST at any dose.  The highest dose 
tested (45 mg/kg/day) showed mild elevations of ALT with about half of values above 
the upper limit of normal range.  The mild elevations of ALT were reversible, returning to within normal range after cessation of drug. 
The Study Director concluded that the once daily administration of vamorolone via oral 
gavage to mice for 26 weeks at 5, 15, and 45 mg/kg/day did not produce any adverse effects.  Therefore, the No-Observable-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) is considered to be 45 mg/kg/day under the conditions of this study. 
39-week chronic toxicity study in beagle dogs 
Vamorolone or vehicle was administered to beagle dogs once daily for 39 weeks at doses 
of 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day.  Six dogs of each sex received each dose or placebo, and two of the six dogs of each sex at each dose or placebo were followed for an additional 
4 weeks to evaluate reversibility, progression, or delayed appearance of any observed 
changes.  One male dog that received 50 mg/kg/day was euthanized in extremis on Day 273 due to paraphimosis (an extended penis).  All other animals survived to their scheduled termination.

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  Detailed clinical observations considered test article-related at 50 mg/kg/day, and 
reversible, included decreased activity (considered adverse), struggling during dosing, 
feces soft, limb function impaired, interdigital cysts, and unkempt appearance 
(considered adverse).  Test article-related, dose-dependent increases in body weight gains correlating with increases in food consumption were observed relative to controls in males at all dose levels and in females at 10 and 50 mg/kg/day.  Test article-related, 
reversible increases in average mean food consumption were observed relative to controls 
over the course of the 39-week dose phase in both sexes at 10 and 50 mg/kg/day. 
No test article-related ophthalmological effects were noted.  No test-article-related 
changes were noted in respi[INVESTIGATOR_120686].  There may have been a 
mild dose-related reversible increase in the heart rate at the terminal post-dose interval 
that was significantly different from vehicle in both sexes following the 50 mg/kg/day dose.  Semen analysis/evaluation for test article affects could not be conducted as there were not enough viable samples collected. 
Test article-related effects on clinical pathology endpoints with microscopic correlates 
included the following: 
• A hepatocellular and hepatobiliary effect in males at 10 mg/kg/day and both sexes 
at 50 mg/kg/day, which included increased alkaline phosphatase, gamma 
glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase activity.  These changes correlated with microscopic changes in the liver, bile 
duct, and gall bladder.  This spectrum of changes was considered adverse in both 
sexes at 50 mg/kg/day. 
• There was also evidence of an inflammatory response in both sexes at 
50 mg/kg/day, which included increased total leukocyte, neutrophil, and 
monocyte counts, and increased fibrinogen and/or globulin concentrations.  The inflammatory response was likely secondary to inflammation in the liver 
associated with hepatocellular necrosis.  Platelet counts were also increased in 
both sexes at 50 mg/kg/day and may have been secondary to the inflammatory response.

with the exceptions of increased alanine aminotransferase activity in both sexes at 
50 mg/kg/day, and increased globulin in males at 50 mg/kg/day. 
Reversible, test article-related macroscopic findings included mildly to moderately 
enlarged livers in males and females at 50 mg/kg/day, which correlated microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_448429]/or hepatocellular vacuolation; 
hemorrhage in the gall bladder of one 50 mg/kg/day female, that was associated with 
moderate acute inflammation and mild vascular necrosis, and considered to be adverse; red focus/foci within the pylorus of the stomach of one 50 mg/kg/day female and one male at 10 mg/kg/day, which correlated microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_120688]. 
Test article-related organ weight changes at the terminal necropsy included decreases in 
adrenal gland weights in both sexes at ≥ 2 mg/kg/day (microscopic correlate of bilateral cortical atrophy); increases in liver weights in both sexes at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day (microscopic 
correlates of panlobular hepatocellular hypertrophy and/or hepatocellular vacuolation); 
increases in kidney weights in females at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day and males at 50 mg/kg/day (microscopic correlate of bilateral tubular vacuolation); decreases in prostate gland weights in males at 50 mg/kg/day (microscopic correlate of decreased secretory product).   
These organ weight changes were all reversible, except for the decreases in the prost ate 
gland.  Microscopic evaluation revealed the following test article-related changes: 
adrenal glands (atrophy of the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa in both sexes at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day and 
atrophy was considered adverse); esophagus and pylorus of the stomach 
(erosion/ulceration in a few animals of both sexes at 50 mg/kg/day); gallbladder (hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the mucosal epi[INVESTIGATOR_120689] ≥ 10 mg/kg/day and cytoplasmic vacuolation of the mucosal epi[INVESTIGATOR_120690] ≥ 10 mg/kg/day and

and an increased incidence of bilateral basophilic tubules in males and females at 50 mg/kg/day); lymphoid depletion in both sexes at 50 mg/kg/day in mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes, thymus and spleen (with extramedullary hematopoiesis in 
50 mg/kg/day females); bone marrow in the sternum (increased adipocytes in males at 
≥ 2 mg/kg/day and females at 50 mg/kg/day); testes (spermatocyte/spermatid degeneration in males at 50 mg/kg/day); epi[INVESTIGATOR_26612] (oligospermia/germ cell debris in males at 50 mg/kg/day); ovaries (absent corpora lutea in females at ≥ 2 mg/kg/day and 
considered adverse); the mammary gland and other tissues in the female reproductive 
tract (uterus, cervix, and vagina) of these animals were consistent with animals that have not ovulated; vacuolation in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_120691] 50 mg/kg/day; parotid salivary gland (cytoplasmic alteration in both sexes at 
≥ 10 mg/kg/day); biceps femoris (atrophy of the skeletal muscle in both sexes at 
50 mg/kg/day); skin (atrophy and alopecia/hypotrichosis in males at 50 mg/kg/day and females at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day); prostate gland (decreased secretory product in males at 50 mg/kg/day); thyroid glands (bilateral increased colloid in males at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). 
Many of the findings were considered by [CONTACT_120749] (affecting the zona fasciculata and reticularis), generalized lymphoid depletion in lymphoid tissues (thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes), increased adipocytes in the bone marrow, atrophy of 
the skeletal muscle, alopecia/hypotrichosis and atrophy of the skin (thinning of the 
dermal collagen and atrophy of hair follicles and adnexa), an absence of corpora lutea in the ovary (likely indicative of delayed puberty), decreased secretory product in the prostate gland, and multiple changes in the liver.  The liver had panlobular hypertrophy 
and vacuolation of hepatocytes consistent with glycogen accumulation.  Due to the 
magnitude of hypertrophy and vacuolation, there were (likely secondary) foci of hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation.

7-day study in cynomolgus monkeys 
Non-naive cynomolgus monkeys were administered vamorolone or vehicle QD for 
7 consecutive days at doses of 100, 300, and 600 mg/kg.  All animals survived until the end of the study period.  There were effects on clinical observations, food consumption, 
and urinalysis attributable to vamorolone that are described below. 
There was a dose proportional decrease in body weight gain observed in males and 
females at each dose (up to 11% and 9% respectively) related to vamorolone.  A cessation of the body weight loss in treatment was observed during the recovery phase 
but no recovery of body weight lost during the 7 days of dosing was observed. 
At termination there were nonsignificant increases in red cell mass and decreases in 
lymphocytes (up to 56%) in the 600 mg/kg/day dose group.  However, most individual animals, including controls, had decreases in lymphocytes (up to 81%) at termination 
relative to their respective pretest.  These decreases had resolved by [CONTACT_448473]. 
In both sexes receiving ≥ 300 mg/kg/day, there was increased urea nitrogen (up to 141%), 
creatinine (up to 58%), total protein (up to 15%), albumin (up to 11%), globulin (up to 
25%), and/or potassium (up to 39%) with concurrent decreases in sodium (up to 10%) 
and chloride (up to 10%) relative to controls.  At the recovery interval, the majority of these effects had resolved (ReveraGen Report No. 1998-001). 
Genotoxicity 
The mutagenic and genotoxic potential of vamorolone was assessed in several assays.  A 
non-GLP Ames screen was negative for bacterial mutations (ReveraGen Report No.

however, a reduction in revertant counts was observed (ReveraGen Report No. 
AD79DT.502ICH.BTL).  Vamorolone was negative for inducing chromosomal 
aberrations in cultured mouse lymphocytes without and with metabolic activation (ReveraGen Report No. AD79DT.704.BTL). 
Femoral bone marrow was microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_120692] (PCEs) containing micronuclei.  No significant reductions in the PCEs/EC 
(total erythrocytes) ratio were observed in the vamorolone groups compared to the vehicle control group.  Although statistically significant increases in the incidence of micronucleated PCEs in the vamorolone treated groups were observed, no dose response 
was observed with respect to other groups and the values of micronuclei for the 
individual animals were within the historical range.  Therefore, the statistically significant increase was considered as biologically insignificant (ReveraGen Report No. AD76BK.123012ICH.BTL). 
A study was performed to evaluate the potential mutagenicity of two theoretical epoxide 
impurities related to the drug substance vamorolone (formerly VBP15), which is a steroid-like structure containing a delta 9,11 double bond.  The delta 9,11 epoxide structures evaluated were VBP15-B-3, which is structurally similar to vamorolone except 
for the epoxide moiety, and VBP15-B-2, which has a 21-acetate substitution (vamorolone 
and VBP15-B-3 contain a 21-hydroxy moiety).  Two validated and complementary in silico prediction methodologies were used for assessing mutagenic potential.  The statistics -based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) program MultiCASE 
CASE Ultra was used, employing four different modules (GT1_A7B, GT1_AT_ECOLI, PHARM_ECOLI, and PHARM_SAL) designed to cover a wide range of molecular substructures collected from both proprietary and public compounds.  In addition, the expert rule-based SAR program Derek Nexus was used to determine if the theoretical 
impurities contained structural alerts associated with known genotoxicants.  CASE Ultra 
predicted both VBP15-B-2 and VBP15-B-3 as negative for mutagenicity (ReveraGen Report “In Silico Mutagenicity Evaluation of Delta 9,11 Epoxide Structures of VBP15: VBP15-B-2 [21-Acetate ] and VBP15-B-3 [21-Hydroxy]”).

1.3 Clinical Experience 
Clinical experience with vamorolone is comprised of a completed Phase I clinical trial of 
vamorolone in healthy adult volunteers (VBP15-001), completed Phase IIa (VBP15-002) 
and Phase II extension (VBP15-003) trials in DMD boys, and an ongoing long-term 
extension (VBP15-LTE) trial in DMD boys.   
1.3.1 Phase I Study in Healthy Adult Male Volunteers (VBP15-001) 
Study Design and Objectives 
The safety, tolerability, and PK of vamorolone were initially evaluated in a Phase I 
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple 
ascending dose (MAD) study.  In the SAD portion of the study, Cohorts 1 through 5 and 
Cohort 7 were comprised of eight subjects each; six subjects in each cohort received a single oral dose of vamorolone (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, 8.0 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg, respectively) and two subjects in each cohort received placebo under 
fasted conditions.  In Cohort 6, six subjects received a single oral dose of 8.0 mg/kg 
vamorolone within 30 minutes of beginning a high fat/high calorie meal.  The MAD portion of the study had four cohorts of 8 subjects each; six subjects in each cohort received 14 daily doses of vamorolone (1.0, 3.0, 9.0 and 20.0 mg/kg/day) and two 
subjects in each cohort received placebo. 
The primary objectives of the Phase I study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
single and multiple oral doses of vamorolone, and to evaluate the PK of single doses and multiple doses of vamorolone.  A secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of food 
on the absorption and PK of vamorolone.  Other objectives were to obtain samples from 
subjects on Day 1 (pre-dose) and Day 14 of the MAD cohorts for use in Metabolites in Safety Testing (MIST) assessments, and to test back-up PK samples from a subset of MAD subjects for pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers.

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  MAD Cohorts  
The Phase I MAD treatment plan was discussed in light of the initial PK data.  The 
relatively short half-life of vamorolone (2-4 hours), coupled with the planned daily dose schedule, would be expected to give PK data on each single dose, not cumulative dose, as the dosing interval was > 5 × t
½.  Thus, the MAD component would be a study of 
individual daily doses, rather than dose-related accumulation and pharmacodistribution related to cumulative drug exposure.  In other words, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_120693] a MAD study is to determine steady state drug levels after multiple doses; yet with the short half-life of vamorolone, useful information would not be expected to be gained with the current daily 
dosing schedule.  Safety and tolerability are additional goals of the MAD study, and these 
remain important endpoints independent of the PK studies. 
MAD Cohorts – Pharmacokinetics Fasted 
The original design for the Phase I MAD was modified to remove the two lowest doses 
(0.1, 0.3 mg/kg/day), and to begin dosing at 1.0 mg/kg/day.  The clinical conduct of all 
four cohorts has been completed (1.0 mg/kg/day, 3.0 mg/kg/day, 9.0 mg/kg/day, 
20.0 mg/kg/day) for the MAD study (Table 4).

experienced any TEAEs.  There was no dose-related trend in the incidence or severity of TEAEs; the dose group with the highest number of subjects reporting TEAEs was the 0.1 mg/kg dose group (2 subjects, 33%), and the highest number of TEAEs (3 events) 
was reported by [ADDRESS_570830] in the 1.0 mg/kg vamorolone dose group.  In the 0.3 and 
3.0 mg/kg vamorolone fasted and the 8.0 mg/kg fed dose groups, [ADDRESS_570831] per group (17%) experienced TEAEs, and no subjects in the 8.0 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, fasted, dose groups experienced any TEAEs.  The most common TEAEs were dizziness and 
headache, each reported by 2 subjects overall (4%); all other TEAEs were reported by 
[INVESTIGATOR_13701] [ADDRESS_570832] (2%) and included ear pain, nausea, non-cardiac chest pain, and blood bilirubin increased.  Three subjects (6%) had TEAEs that were considered possibly related to treatment.  Possibly related TEAEs included nausea ([ADDRESS_570833], 2%), dizziness 
(2 subjects, 4%), and headache (2 subjects, 4%).  One subject (2%) had a moderate

MAD Cohorts 
In the MAD part, overall, a total of 6 subjects (19%) administered vamorolone or placebo 
experienced a total of 10 TEAEs: 2 subjects each in the 1.0 mg/kg vamorolone, 20 mg/kg 
vamorolone, and placebo groups, and none in the 3.0 mg/kg and 9.0 mg/kg dose groups.  
There was no dose-related trend in the incidence or severity of TEAEs.  The most common TEAE was headache (2 subjects, 6%); all other TEAEs occurred in only [ADDRESS_570835] (3%) per group, and included nausea, toothache, vomiting, ALT increased, 
hepatic enzyme increased, arthralgia, dizziness, and syncope.  TEAEs were considered 
possibly related in 2 subjects (6%) and remotely related in [ADDRESS_570836] (3%).  Possibly related AEs were ALT increased and hepatic enzyme increased, occurring in [ADDRESS_570837] in the 20 mg/kg vamorolone and placebo groups, respectively.  The remotely related TEAEs 
were dizziness and syncope, both occurring in the same subject (1.0 mg/kg vamorolone).  
All TEAEs were mild in severity. 
With the exception of the AEs related to hepatic enzymes, there were no other 
meaningful changes in clinical laboratory parameters.  Of note, glucose levels remained 
stable at all doses of vamorolone in both the SAD and MAD parts, suggesting that 
vamorolone does not induce insulin resistance at the doses and dosing duration studied; in addition, no changes in the white blood cell count differential were observed, suggesting that vamorolone did not induce immunosuppressive effects in this study 
population. 
Pharmacodynamic Safety Biomarkers Vamorolone has shown improved safety profiles relative to prednisone in nonclinical 
testing, both in vitro and in vivo.
15,17  Safety concerns with glucocorticoids include 
suppression of the adrenal axis and insulin resistance.  Pharmacodynamic biomarker assays of suppression of the adrenal axis (serum cortisol) and insulin resistance (serum glucose) were measured in the Phase I MAD studies of vamorolone.

Note:  Placebo subjects from each of the four MAD cohorts are graphed together.   
Vamorolone showed little evidence of either acute (24 hour data), or chronic (Day 15 
data) suppression of the adrenal axis at doses of either 1.0 mg/kg/day or 3.0 mg/kg/day.  
The data suggest that vamorolone induces variable, mild, acute and chronic suppression 
of the adrenal axis at 9.0 mg/kg/day, and stronger evidence of both acute and chronic adrenal axis suppression at 20.0 mg/kg/day.  Prednisone typi[INVESTIGATOR_448430] 0.1 mg/kg/day,

Vamorolone thus shows approximately a 10-fold improvement in safety window 
compared to prednisone on a mg/kg comparative basis.  These data are consistent with in vitro  and ex vivo nonclinical mouse data comparing vamorolone to prednisone for 
adrenal suppression.

Summary of Phase I Data 
Pharmacokinetics 
• Vamorolone PK data show strong adherence to dose linearity and dose 
proportionality, with relatively little subject-subject variation (both SAD and 
MAD). 
• The half-life was about 2 hours for doses 0.1-1.0 mg/kg.  Doses at 3.0, 8.0, and 20.0 mg/kg showed an extended tail, increasing half-life to 2.5, 3.8, and 3.8 hours, 
respectively.  The PK for the MAD cohorts was very similar to the SAD cohorts, 
showing little if any drug accumulation, consistent with the short half-life and daily dosing schedule. 
• There were no apparent relationships between CL/F and body size, either in term s 
of body weight or BMI. 
• For the food effect group, a high fat meal was given to a cohort of Phase I SAD 
volunteers with the 8.0 mg/kg dose of vamorolone.  Comparison of the data from 
the high fat meal with the fasted 8.0 mg/kg cohort data showed that absorption was 
increased by 2.5-fold by [CONTACT_120751], consistent with the lipophilic character 
of vamorolone (steroidal compound). 
Safety 
• Single and multiple daily doses of vamorolone up to 20 mg/kg were well tolerated 
by [CONTACT_256198], and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD ) was not identified. 
• Regarding the primary target organ, liver, one subject in the 20 mg/kg vamorolone 
MAD dose group who had an elevation of serum bilirubin at baseline (pre-dose) 
experienced an AE of ALT increased after 9 days of dosing; this AE was judged to 
be possibly related to vamorolone and drug dosing was halted.  No other subjects in the vamorolone dose groups experienced AEs related to liver function.

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  • Results of post-dose morning cortisol levels suggest that vamorolone causes acute 
adrenal suppression after single dosing and chronic adrenal suppression after 
multiple dosing, but only at the higher (≥ 8.0 mg/kg) single and multiple doses 
studied. 
• Safety PD biomarker studies showed that vamorolone had an improved safety window for adrenal axis suppression (100-fold increase in therapeutic window), no 
evidence of insulin resistance, no changes in bone turnover markers (osteocalcin, C-terminal peptide fragment of collagen 1[CTX1]), compared to prednisone studies reported in the literature
25,30 
• There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECGs, or physical 
examinations. 
1.3.2 Pharmacokinetics in Phase IIa Study in 4 to 7 years Duchenne Muscular 
Dystrophy Boys (VBP15-002) 
Forty-eight boys with DMD received oral doses of vamorolone once daily for 14 days at doses of 0.25 mg/kg/day, 0.75 mg/kg/day, 2.0 mg/kg/day, and 6.0 mg/kg/day, [ADDRESS_570846]-dose and plasma was analyzed for vamorolone.  Th e 
time-course of plasma drug concentrations was assessed using noncompartmental 
analytical (NCA) methods using the WinNonlin software (Certara).   
Of the 48 DMD subjects enrolled in the study (12 at each dosing level), 47 had evaluable 
PK data.  The average Day 1 and Day 14 vamorolone concentration versus time profiles are shown in Figure 8 for the four dose levels.  Overall, as expected, higher doses 
resulted in higher plasma concentrations of vamorolone.  In particular, plasma 
vamorolone concentrations versus time showed a rapid to moderate rate of absorption, a maximum concentration (C
max) at a T max of 2 to 4 hours, and a decline phase with a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_448431]-life (t 1/2) of [ADDRESS_570847] 2020

Compared with fasting healthy adult volunteers (Section 1.3.1), the boys with DMD 
showed lower C max values  and more variation in the time to reach the maximal 
concentration of vamorolone for any given dose.  This observation might be due to the fact that the boys with DMD received vamorolone after [ADDRESS_570851] played a role.  The apparent 
clearance of vamorolone seems higher in the boys with DMD but this finding is not significant.

study: two SAEs of pneumonia in two different subjects (both subjects receiving 
vamorolone 0.75 mg/kg/day), one SAE of bilateral testicular torsion and one SAE of 
hypoxia in the same subject receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day, one SAE of influenza associated dehydration in a subject receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day, and two SAEs of acute myoglobinuria in the same subject receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day.  Each of these SAEs was considered 
unrelated to study drug, and none of them resulted in discontinuation from the study.  In 
the VBP15-003 study, there were a total of 218 TEAEs among 42 of the 48 subjects (87.5%).  In VBP15-[ADDRESS_570853] infection (41.7%); pyrexia (35.4%); cough (18.8%); vomiting (14.6%); 
and diarrhea (10.4%).   
Body Mass Index (BMI): Body Mass Index was measured throughout the VBP15-003 
study.  The mean change from baseline to Week 24 for BMI was 0.03, 0.20, 0.23, and 1.15 for the 0.25, 0.75, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/day dose level groups, respectively.  Body 
Mass Index increases generally reflect an increase in weight.  Body Mass Index z-score 
was monitored in the VBP15-003 study.  The mean change from baseline to Week 24 for BMI z-score for the 6.0 mg/kg/day group showed a statistically significant increase compared to the mean change from baseline to Week 24 for the 0.25 mg/kg/day and 
0.75 mg/kg/day dose level groups.  In contrast, the mean change from baseline to 
Week 24 for the 2.0 mg/kg/day dose level group in BMI z-score was minimal and comparisons with the other vamorolone dose level groups lacked statistical significance.  The mean increase from baseline to Week 24 for BMI z-score was similar for the 
6.0 mg/kg/day group and a daily prednisone-treated historical control group.  
 
Potential liver toxicity:  In the Phase I clinical trial in adult volunteers, vamorolone 
showed mild elevations of liver enzymes in one subject receiving 20.0 mg/kg in the 
fasted state, and dosing was halted.  All DMD subjects have elevated serum ALT and 
AST enzymes because of the muscle condition.  For that reason, two enzymes, glutamate 
dehydrogenase (GLDH) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GTT), that are preferentially expressed in liver were evaluated in the VBP15-[ADDRESS_570854] 2020

GLDH and GGT data, vamorolone at dose levels up to 6.0 mg/kg/day does not appear to 
induce liver toxicity over a 24-week treatment period. 
Adrenal suppression: In the VBP15-003 study, after 24 weeks of treatment, 0 of 8 tested 
participants (0.25 mg/kg/day), 1 of 12 (8.3%) tested participants (0.75 mg/kg/day), 5 of 
12 (41.7%) tested participants (2.0 mg/kg/day), and 8 of 9 (88.9%) tested participants 
(6.0 mg/kg/day) had a depressed morning cortisol (<3.6 μg/dL [100 nM]) consistent with chronic adrenal suppression.

Insulin resistance: In the VBP15-003 study, mean changes from baseline for fasting 
insulin showed dose-and time-related changes for all dose level groups at Week 12 and 
Week 24.  Statistical significance was observed for mean increase from baseline for the 6.0 mg/kg/day dose level group at Week 12 and Week 24.

The proposed Phase IIb clinical trial (VBP15-004) is designed as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_448433] a Treatment Period of 24 weeks leads to superior 
improvements in strength and mobility versus placebo (efficacy), with a reduced adverse 
effect profile versus prednisone treatment (safety), and to demonstrate persistence of 
effect over a Treatment Period of 48 weeks.  To determine efficacy, functional outcomes 
in DMD patient groups receiving one of two doses of vamorolone over 24 weeks will be 
compared to functional outcomes of DMD patients receiving placebo.  To determine 
safety, body mass index (BMI) and PD safety biomarker findings in DMD patients

Evaluation of the two dose levels of vamorolone, prednisone, and placebo during the 24-
week Treatment Period #1 in this study will allow comparison of change from baseline in 
safety parameters, muscle strength and functional efficacy parameters, and PD biomarker levels over 24 weeks of treatment as compared to no treatment (placebo) or standard of care treatment (prednisone).  In particular, evaluation of change of the PD biomarkers from baseline over a longer (24-week) period may aid in the clinical validation of 
biomarkers which exhibit small changes over time.  In addition, evaluation of the two 
dose levels of vamorolone over the total 48-week period of the study will allow assessment of the persistence of effect. 
The primary efficacy outcome is the Time to Stand (TTSTAND) from the floor 
(velocity), and comparison will be made between the 6.0 mg/kg/day dose level of 
vamorolone and the placebo group at Week 24.  Multiple secondary and exploratory efficacy outcomes will be measured, including TTSTAND, Time to Run/Walk 10 meters (TTRW), Time to Climb four stairs (TTCLIMB), North Star Ambulatory Assessment

myometry (elbow flexors and knee extensors).  Additional exploratory measures of 
efficacy include PD biomarkers that have previously been shown to be glucocorticoid-
responsive in DMD boys and inflammatory bowel disease in children.31  Moreover, 
physical functioning, behavior, neuropsychology, and satisfaction with treatment will be measured as exploratory outcomes using the parent proxy-report of Pediatric Outcomes 
Data Collection Instrument (PODCI), PARS III, Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire 
(TSQM), and Ease of Study Medication Administration Assessment for the study medication suspension, respectively.
   
For the safety measure of body mass index (BMI) z-score, comparisons will be made 
between each dose level of vamorolone and the prednisone-treated group.  Additional 
secondary safety measures are serum biomarkers bridged to later clinical safety concerns.  These include: 
1. Adrenal suppression.  Pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids cause 
suppression of the hypothalamo-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal axis, leading to low 
concentration of endogenous cortisol and other steroidal hormones in serum.  Adrenal suppression is directly associated with risk of adrenal crisis, delay of puberty and stunting of growth.  Measurement of morning cortisol concentrations 
will reflect the degree of adrenal suppression.  Plasma cortisol secretion typi[INVESTIGATOR_448434] a circadian pattern with the highest concentrations early in the morning; a morning serum cortisol concentration less than 3.6 µg/dL (or 100 nM) is highly suggestive of adrenal suppression.  A single cortisol measurement at other times 
of the day is of limited value and dynamic testing with Cosyntropin (a synthetic 
peptide of ACTH, also known as tetracosactide) is a standard approach to the assessmen t of endogenous cortisol production.
32  Serum cortisol levels less than 
18 µg/dL (500 nM) 30 or 60 minutes after stimulation with Cosyntropin (250 µg) 
are considered diagnostic of adrenal suppression.  
2. Bone turnover.  Pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids cause an imbalance of 
bone formation and bone resorption, leading to later osteopenia and bone

bridged to later clinical outcomes of osteopenia are osteocalcin (bone formation; glucocorticoids decrease serum levels), and CTX1 (bone resorption; glucocorticoids increase serum levels).  Decreases of osteocalcin and increases of 
CTX1 are reflective of abnormal bone turnover, a risk factor bridged to later 
bone fragility. 
3. Insulin resistance.  Insulin resistance is the term where increased blood glucose triggers increased insulin secretion from the pancreatic islet cells, but the 
elevated serum insulin fails to sufficiently trigger glucose uptake by [CONTACT_448475]/or liver.  Thus, peripheral tissues are resistant to insulin signaling (insulin resistance).  Insulin resistance has been bridged to later clinical outcomes, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and vascular disease.  Serum biomarkers 
that are accepted as measures of insulin resistance are increased serum glucose 
and insulin.  This can be measured after acute (hours after first dose) or chronic (after weeks or months of dosing) glucocorticoid treatment. 
Additional exploratory safety outcomes are measures of additional serum safety 
biomarkers that have been defined in glucocorticoid-treated DMD and inflammatory 
bowel disease patients. 
This trial will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, and in accordance with the 
ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that are 
consistent with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable regulatory requirements, 
and the recently issued FDA guidance on developi[INVESTIGATOR_448435].

It is anticipated that the adverse effect profile of the investigational product will be more 
favorable than standard of care glucocorticoids in the long term.  There has been a total 
of 11 SAEs in the vamorolone program to date: a total of [ADDRESS_570864] been two SAEs of pneumonia 
in two different subjects (both subjects receiving vamorolone 0.75 mg/kg/day); one SAE 
of bilateral testicular torsion and one SAE of hypoxia in the same subject receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day; one SAE of influenza associated dehydration in a subject receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day; two SAEs of acute myoglobulinemia in the same subject receiving 6.0 
mg/kg/day; one SAE of viral gastroenteritis with secondary dehydration in a subject 
receiving blinded study drug; one SAE of asthma exacerbation in the setting of respi[INVESTIGATOR_448436] a subject receiving vamorolone at either 2.0 mg/kg/day or 6.0 mg/kg/day; one SAE of perforated appendicitis occurring with [ADDRESS_570865] receiving 20.0 mg/kg in the fasted state.  One subject participating in VBP15-[ADDRESS_570866] bilirubin, ALP and GGT during Treatment Period #1 and 
after study drug interruption and restart, redeveloped acute cholestatic hepatitis in 
Treatment Period #2.  Unblinding of the treatment assignment for this subject, to facilitate decisions regarding subsequent standard of care corticosteroid therapy, indicated that the subject had been on vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day in both Treatment 
Period #1 and Treatment Period #2.   
In the VBP15-002 study, after 2 weeks of treatment, 0 of 11 tested participants who 
received vamorolone 0.25 mg/kg/day, [ADDRESS_570867] 2020

vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day, and 6 of 10 (60.0%) tested participants who received 
vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day had a depressed morning cortisol (<3.6 μg/dL [100 nmol/L]) 
consistent with chronic adrenal suppression.  In the VBP15-003 study, after 24 weeks of treatment, 0 of 8 tested participants (0.25 mg/kg/day), 1 of 12 (8.3%) tested participants (0.75 mg/kg/day), 5 of 12 (41.7%) tested participants (2.0 mg/kg/day), and 8 of 9 (88.9%) 
tested participants (6.0 mg/kg/day) had a depressed morning cortisol (<3.6 μg/dL 
[100 nM]) consistent with chronic adrenal suppression.  Instructions for detecting adrenal crisis and the circumstances in which stress dose steroids should be provided will be included in the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and Manual of Operations, and 
Investigators should monitor clinical study participants closely to identify elevations in 
liver-specific enzymes.   
Potential Health Benefits: Subjects may or may not receive direct health benefit from 
participating in the study.  Some subjects will be randomly assigned to vamorolone at one 
of two planned dose levels (2.0 mg/kg/day and 6.0 mg/kg/day) over the course of the 
48-week trial.  In the VBP15-003 study, clinical efficacy was assessed by [CONTACT_448476].  Improvement in Time to Stand, Time to Climb, Time to Run/Walk [ADDRESS_570868] were seen predominantly for the 2.0 and 
6.0 mg/kg/day dose level groups, with many of the improvements showing statistical significance compared to an untreated Duchenne Natural History Group.  In view of the initial clinical evidence of safe ty, the improvements observed in the assessments of 
efficacy, and the nature of potential adverse effects that can be monitored, the data 
support an acceptable benefit/risk profile for vamorolone.

3.1 Overall Study Design 
This Phase IIb study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo- and active-
controlled study with double-blind extension to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, tolerability, PD, and population PK of vamorolone (the investigational medicine) compared to prednisone (active control) and placebo over a Treatment Period of 
24 weeks in boys ages 4 to <[ADDRESS_570885] 
over a total Treatment Period of 48 weeks.  Six  treatment groups will receive either 
vamorolone at one of two doses (2.0 mg/kg or 6.0 mg/kg), prednisone (0.75 mg/kg), or placebo once daily for 24 weeks, and will receive vamorolone at one of two doses 
(2.0 mg/kg or 6.0 mg/kg) daily for an additional 20 weeks.  A total of approximately 
120 subjects will be randomized into the study as shown in Table 6.  
To maintain the blind during Treatment Period #1, matched suspension (vamorolone or placebo) and matched tablets (prednisone or placebo) will be administered.  Each subject 
will receive a dose of suspension (vamorolone or placebo) and tablets (prednisone and 
placebo) once daily during Treatment Period #1.  The number of tablets and volume of suspension per dose will be determined by [CONTACT_18694].  
The study is comprised of a Pretreatment Screening Period of up to 32 days duration, a 
1-day Pretreatment Baseline Period, a 24-week Treatment Period #1, a 4-week Transition 
Period, a 20-week Treatment Period #2, and a 4-week Dose-tapering Period.  Subjects will be enrolled into this study at the time written informed consent is given, and randomized to treatment only after completion of all Pretreatment Screening assessments. 
Study drug dosing will occur from Day 1 until the Week 48 Visit (Section 5.3).  Study 
drug dosing will occur at home on all days except the Day 1, Week 2, Week 12, Week 24, Week 28, Week 30, Week 40, and Week 48 study visits, when dosing will occur at the study site.   
Subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability, clinical efficacy, PD, and population 
PK at scheduled visits throughout the study (see Section 6 for a schedule of study assessments).  Treatment Period #1, Transition Period, and Treatment Period #[ADDRESS_570886] 2020

To blind the liquid formulation, the supplies company will manufacture 1.33% and 4.0% 
wt/wt  vamorolone suspension formulations, and placebo suspension formulation, 
identical in appearance.  Subjects who are randomized to receive vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg 
will receive the 1.33% vamorolone suspension, and subjects who are randomized to receive vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg will receive the 4.0% vamorolone suspension.  Study 
medication will be shipped to the sites in [ADDRESS_570899] body weight for all subjects as 0.15 mL/kg, regardless of treatment assignment. 
Subjects, parents/guardians, site investigators and all other site study staff will not know 
to which treatment group the subject has been assigned and will remain blinded to the

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  3.[ADDRESS_570901], to be carried at all times, stating “I am taking part 
in a clinical trial” (in the local language) to be presented to medical staff in the event of routine treatment or a medical emergency.  Investigational medications can usually be withdrawn without the need for unblinding in a subject experiencing an AE that requires 
study medication withdrawal.  In this case, the site investigator should provide adequate and necessary support to the subject without unblinding study treatment.   
Subjects who experience a medical emergency, whether their treatment remains blinded 
or is unblinded, should be covered with stress steroids, except for unblinded subjects who 
were receiving placebo.   
All subjects who have study medication withdrawn without unblinding will need to 
undergo dose-tapering according to the schedule in Section 6.4. 
In the event that unblinding is necessary, an emergency unblinding procedure is provided 
to allow site investigators to disclose a treatment assignment for an individual subject if 
clinical circumstances should require this.   
Unblinding will be performed and treatment assignment obtained through the IXRS 
system with username [CONTACT_448521].  The expectation is that emergency unblinding 
will occur only very rarely; for example, when the subject needs emergency surgery and 
information about all treatment interventions is required.  In the exceptional circumstance 
that knowledge of the study drug assignment appears essential for providing appropriate medical management, the site investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_448479].  
If the site investigator still believes that unblinding is needed, or the study chair and independent Medical Monitor are not available for contact, the site investigator will follow the IXRS unblinding procedures for unblinding the subject in question (see the 
Manual of Operations for details on how to unblind a subject using the IXRS system).   
After breaking the blind, the site staff should record details regarding the reasons for 
breaking the blind, including any AEs  leading to the unblinding, in the source documents

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  and electronic case report form (eCRF).  Once the blind is broken for a given subject, 
study drug will be discontinued and the subject will be withdrawn from the study.  
Furthermore, as the subject might have received glucocorticoids (prednisone) as part of 
the study and as vamorolone appears to affect the adrenal axis, prednisone and vamorolone cannot be discontinued without a proper dose-tapering period.   
Any subject whose treatment is unblinded prior to the Week [ADDRESS_570903] has not withdrawn consent; any subject whose treatment is unblinded after Week [ADDRESS_570904] has not 
withdrawn consent; any subject whose treatment is unblinded after Week [ADDRESS_570905] has not withdrawn consent.  Since all subjects will receive vamorolone at one of two dose levels during Treatment Period #2 
(Weeks 28 – 48), the identification, through unblinding, of the vamorolone dose level to 
which a given subject is assigned is unlikely to give additional useful information, and thus the need to unblind treatment assignment is remote during this study period.  Any subject whose treatment, upon unblinding, is revealed to be either vamorolone or 
prednisone, will need to follow the dose-tapering protocol (Section 6.4 specific to the 
time of unblinding); these subjects will also be asked to return to the clinic at the end of the tapering period for final Dose-tapering Period assessments, whenever possible.  If the subject was taking placebo prior to unblinding, study drug tapering will not be required; 
however, the subject should return for final Week [ADDRESS_570906] 2020

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  5.4 Rationale for Dose Selection 
Dose levels of the investigational medication were chosen for this study to ensure the 
safety of subjects participating in the study, and to allow demonstration of efficacy and 
PD effects.  The prednisone (active control) dose was selected based on current standard of care practice in boys with DMD.   
All doses of study medication will be administered in the morning with breakfast, 
including at least 8 g of fat (approximately 8 ounces [240 mL] of full-fat milk or 
equivalent high-fat food portion).   
Based on the comparison between the PK parameters in DMD boys receiving 0.25 mg/kg 
or 0.75 mg/kg vamorolone with a glass of full-fat milk or equivalent fat-containing food 
and the PK parameters in healthy adult males receiving similar doses of vamorolone 
fasted, it appears that the 2.5-fold increase in exposure observed between the fasted and fed conditions in the healthy adult males (Section 1.3.1) is not reproduced in the DMD boys (see Section 1.3.2).  The rationale for the lowest vamorolone dose of 2.0 mg/kg/day, 
administered with a glass of full-fat milk or equivalent fat-containing food is as follows: 
A starting dose of 2.0 mg/kg/day with a glass of milk is approximately 10% of the highest safe dose tested in adults (20.0 mg/kg/day fasted). 
The highest vamorolone dose to be administered, 6.0 mg/kg/day, will similarly be 
administered with a glass of full-fat milk or equivalent fat-containing food.  As 
20.0 mg/kg/day fasted in adult volunteers was shown to be safe in the Phase I adult volunteer study, the proposed highest dose in 4 to 7 year-old children is approximately 30% of the highest safe adult dose.  Based on the Phase I PD biomarker safety data 
presented in Section 1.3, safety signals reflective of insulin resistance are not anticipated 
at either of the planned dose levels.  Also based on the Phase I data, vamorolone showed little evidence of either acute (24-hour data) or chronic (Day 15 data) suppression of the adrenal axis at doses of either 1.0 mg/kg/day or 3.0 mg/kg/day.  The data suggest that 
vamorolone induces variable, mild, acute and chronic suppression of the adrenal axis at 
9.0 mg/kg/day, and stronger evidence of both acute and chronic adrenal axis suppression at 20.0 mg/kg/day.

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  Vamorolone at doses of 0.25 mg/kg/day, 0.75 mg/kg/day, 2.0 mg/kg/day and 
6.0 mg/kg/day has been demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated in a 2-week Phase IIa 
study (VBP15-002) in 4 to <7 years DMD boys.  There has been a total of 11 SAEs in the 
vamorolone program to date: a total of [ADDRESS_570943] been two SAEs of pneumonia in two different 
subjects (both subjects receiving vamorolone 0.75 mg/kg/day); one SAE of bilateral 
testicular torsion and one SAE of hypoxia in the same subject receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day; one SAE of influenza associated dehydration in a subject receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day; two SAEs of acute myoglobulinemia in the same subject receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day; one SAE 
of viral gastroenteritis with secondary dehydration in a subject receiving blinded study 
drug; one SAE of asthma exacerbation in the setting of respi[INVESTIGATOR_448436] a subject receiving vamorolone at either 2.0 mg/kg/day or 6.0 mg/kg/day; one SAE of perforated appendicitis occurring with [ADDRESS_570944] receiving vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg in the Phase II extension study (VBP15-003) who had an incidental early morning 
cortisol drawn following an AE of presyncope had evidence of adrenal suppression.  In 
the VBP15-003 study, after 24 weeks of treatment, 0 of 8 tested participants (0.25 mg/kg/day), 1 of 12 (8.3%) tested participants (0.75 mg/kg/day), 5 of 12 (41.7%) tested participants (2.0 mg/kg/day), and 8 of 9 (88.9%) tested participants 
(6.0 mg/kg/day) had a depressed morning cortisol (<3.6 μg/dL [100 nM]) consistent with 
chronic adrenal suppression.
29  Thus, based on the available data in the Phase I and Phase 
II studies regarding the safety signal of suppression of the adrenal axis, the possibility of adrenal suppression is present in subjects at the 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/day dose levels.    
The dose of prednisone has been selected according to the Care Recommendation for 
DMD (daily prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day).  The weight-dose bands (Table 10) have been selected to ensure that subjects will not be overdosed in view of the potential side effects.

10 STATISTICAL METHODS AND PLANNED ANALYSES 
10.1 Sample Size Determination 
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo- and active-controlled study.  
Study medication is administered daily in this Phase IIb trial.  Data for untreated subjects from the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) Duchenne Natural History Study
38,39,40,41 and data for prednisone treated subjects from the CINRG 
Prednisone study42 were used to help estimate sample sizes for this study.   
In the vamorolone VBP15-003 study and the interim analysis of the VBP15-LTE study, doses of 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day showed little evidence of clinical benefit, whereas doses of 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/day both showed clear evidence of clinical benefit 
comparable to that seen with glucocorticoids (prednisone and deflazacort). 
In consideration of the primary efficacy endpoint, comparison of 6.0 mg/kg/day 
vamorolone versus placebo, sample size calculations were performed using data from vamorolone-treated subjects from the VBP15-002/VBP15-003 24-week treatment period.  
The analysis compared TTSTAND velocity from the combined 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/day 
groups (Treatment Group) to the combined 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups (Pseudo-Placebo Group).   
Least squares (LS) means from the mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
modeling of VBP15-002/VBP15-003 24-week data were used as parameter estimates of 
the population means in the sample size calculations for the comparison of the Treatment Group (2.0 + 6.0 mg/kg/day) vs. the Pseudo-Placebo Group (0.25 + 0.75 mg/kg/day) on the mean change from baseline at Week 24.  For the estimates of standard deviations

10.2 Statistical and Analytical Plan (SAP) 
The sections below summarize the intended statistical methods and analyses for th is 
study.  A more detailed SAP will be written and finalized prior to any lock of the study 
database (final or interim, if applicable) and any analysis performed.  The SAP will give 
a detailed description of the summaries and analyses that will be performed and will clearly describe when these analyses will take place.   
10.2.1 Deviations from the Statistical Analysis Plan 
Any deviation(s) from the original SAP will be described and justified in the clinical 
study report. 
10.3 Analysis Populations 
Four populations will be defined for data analysis: the Safety Population, the modified 
Intent-to-Treat Population, the Per Protocol Population (PPP), and the Pharmacokinetic 
Population.   
10.3.[ADDRESS_571120] one dose of study medication will be included in the 
Safety Population.  The Safety Population is the primary analysis population for safety 
and PD assessments.  Results will be presented “as treated.” 
10.3.2 Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population  
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication and have at least one post-
baseline assessment will be included in the mITT Population.  The mITT Population is 
the primary analysis population for clinical efficacy.  Subjects who receive at least one dose but never have post-baseline assessments will be excluded.  Results will be presented “as randomized.”

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  10.3.3 Per Protocol Population 
The Per Protocol Population (PPP) will be those subjects in the mITT Population who 
had no major protocol deviations and will be the secondary analysis population for 
analysis of the efficacy data.  The PPP will also exclude some subjects because of missed assessments due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_571122] lock 
10.3.4 Pharmacokinetic (PK) Population 
All subjects who receive at least one dose of vamorolone study medication and have 
sufficient data for PK analysis will be included in the PK Population. 
10.4 Measures Taken to Avoid/Minimize Bias 
Not applicable. 10.5 Interim Analysis 
No formal interim statistical analyses are planned; however, interim safety data and 
overviews will be supplied to the DSMB.  Since this is a blinded study, an unblinded and 
independent statistician will be involved in preparing the overviews for the DSMB.  
These overviews will not be shared outside the unblinded and independent statistician and the unblinded DSMB members. 
10.6 Week 24 Analysis 
The primary analyses for this study are the analyses which will be performed after all 
subjects complete Week 24 of Treatment Period #1.  The results from these analyses will be provided to regulatory authorities.  Investigators, study subjects, study staff, and monitors will remain blinded throughout the duration of the 52-week study.  The 
Sponsor, including data management and statistical personnel, will be unblinded after the 
Week 24 analyses.   
10.7 Week 48 Analysis 
The Week 48 analyses will be performed after all subjects complete Week 48 of 
Treatment Period #2.  The results from these analyses will be provided to regulatory

10.8 Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data 
The primary analyses for the primary and secondary efficacy variables will be conducted 
on observed data only; the MMRMs will employ appropriate covariance structures to accommodate missing data, as described in Section 10.9.4.  Missing efficacy data will be 
imputed for supportive sensitivity analyses on the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints using the following methods: 
• Multiple Imputations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC); and 
• Multiple Imputations using a Control-based Pattern Mixture Model. 
Full details will be provided in the SAP. 
10.9 Statistical Analysis 
10.9.1 General Considerations 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS
® version 9.4 or later. 
All measurements will be analyzed based upon the type of distribution, and descriptive 
statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_448513], as appropriate.  Descriptive statistics for continuous variables (number [N], mean, median, standard 
deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum), descriptive statistics for categorical variables 
(N and percentage), and individual subject profiles will be presented, as appropriate.   
No formal interim statistical analyses are planned, apart from the interim data views and 
presentations to be created for the DSMB.  Missing values for safety and exploratory 
outcomes will be treated as missing, unless stated otherwise. 
Baseline measurement is defined as the last non-missing value prior to the first dose of 
study drug in the study.  
Treatment Period #1 analyses will be summarized by [CONTACT_448463]: 
• Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day (n=30);  
• Vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day (n=30);

Treatment Period #2 analyses (besides historical control comparison data) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_448464]: 
• Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day ® Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day (n=30);

• Placebo ® Vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day (n=15); and  
• Placebo ® Vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day (n=15). 
TTSTAND, TTCLIMB, and TTRW will be analyzed using raw scores and velocity.  
Velocity will be calculated as follows: 
• TTSTAND velocity = 1 / TTSTAND and is expressed as rises/sec 
• TTCLIMB velocity = 1 / TTCLIMB and is expressed as tasks/sec 
• TTRW velocity = 10 / TTRW and is expressed as meters/sec 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed and will be described in the SAP. 
10.9.2 Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons 
The primary efficacy endpoint tests vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day vs. placebo using 
TTSTAND velocity at Week 24 and occurs during Treatment Period #1 of the study.  The primary efficacy endpoint supports the primary objective of this study.  The study is thus 
powered for the efficacy comparison using an alpha level of 0.05 for success.   
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested at Week 24 along with the primary 
efficacy endpoint using a fixed sequential testing process where the fixed sequence of testing will be done in the following order: 
1. TTSTAND velocity, vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day vs placebo 
2. [ADDRESS_571125] (6MWT) meters walked, vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day vs. placebo

7. 6MWT meters walked, vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day vs. prednisone 
Each test in the sequence will be carried out using a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.  Statistical testing of the primary/secondary efficacy endpoints will stop if a p-value >0.05 
occurs or if a p-value ≤ 0.05 occurs in the wrong direction.  In case the fixed sequential 
testing process stops, the results of the subsequent tests will be reported with nominal p-values, but p-values ≤ 0.05 in the right direction will not be considered proof of statistical testing success in these subsequent tests. 
All other analyses will not be corrected for multiple comparisons (tests will be performed 
at the 0.05 alpha level), as they will be viewed and handled in the perspective of not testing a formal hypothesis. 
10.9.[ADDRESS_571128] demographics (e.g., age, race, and ethnicity) and baseline characteristics (e.g., 
height, weight, and months/years since DMD diagnosis) will be summarized 
descriptively by [CONTACT_6654], per analysis population.  Baseline characteristics between groups presented in these summary tables will be reviewed for any clinically relevant differences among the treatment groups, and may be accounted for

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  10.9.4 Efficacy Analyses  
The evaluations of clinical efficacy will be performed using the mITT Population and 
PPP.  Analyses will be done as per randomized treatment. 
All efficacy will be summarized and listed.  Where considered relevant, plots will be 
created. 
The primary efficacy outcome is Time to Stand (TTSTAND) from supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (velocity), 
comparison of vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day vs. placebo.  Secondary and exploratory 
efficacy outcomes are TTSTAND (velocity), comparison of vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day vs. placebo; the NSAA assessment; Time to Climb four stairs (TTCLIMB) (velocity); Time to Run/Walk 10 meters (TTRW) (velocity); the distance walked in 6 minutes 
(6MWT); hand-held myometry (elbow flexors and knee extensors); and ROM.  
The primary efficacy outcome TTSTAND (velocity) change from baseline to Week 24 
will be compared between the 6.0 mg/kg/day vamorolone dose group and the placebo group using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM).  This model includes fixed effects for treatment (vamorolone 2.0 
mg/kg/day, vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day, prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day, and placebo), week, baseline TTSTAND, age group (per stratification), and the treatment-by-week interaction.  Study week will be included in the model as a categorical variable (Weeks 6, 
12, and 24) along with the treatment-by-week interaction.  Within this model, pairwise 
comparisons (using least squares [LS] mean contrasts) will be made to compare TTSTAND velocity at 24 week s for the vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day dose level with 
placebo (primary efficacy outcome).   
For secondary outcomes, the same models will be used as for the primary outcome 
(REML-based MMRM including fixed effects for treatment [vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day, vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day, prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day, and placebo], age group [<6 years; ≥ 6 years], week, baseline, and treatment-by-week interaction). 
An unstructured covariance matrix will be used, and underlying modelling assumptions 
will be checked.  If differences between baseline characteristics exist between the treatment groups, it will be investigated if adjustment for these characteristics is clinically

models.   Full details will be provided in the SAP. 
The following sensitivity analyses will be performed (see SAP for full details) for the primary efficacy and secondary efficacy endpoints: 
• Multiple imputations using MCMC methods for missing data; 
• Multiple imputations using a Control-based Pattern-Mixture Model for missing 
data. 
Additional sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on 
the primary endpoint.  Supportive analyses will also be performed on the primary 
endpoint.  Full details will be provided in the SAP. 
Subjects who are randomized to receive vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day or vamorolone 
6.0 mg/kg/day for both treatment periods will have TTSTAND velocity change from baseline data captured over [ADDRESS_571131] results, and ECG results, and these will be presented using descriptive statistics.

ReveraGen BioPharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  In Treatment Period #1, BMI z-score change from baseline results will be compared 
between treatment groups using an REML-based MMRM analysis with treatment group, 
week of the visit, and the treatment-by-week interaction as factors, and baseline BMI 
z-score and age group as a covariate.  Week will be included in the model as a categorical variable (Week 12 and 24) along with the treatment-by-week interaction.  An unstructured within-subject covariance matrix will be used.  If this analysis fails to 
converge, Akaike’s information criterion will be used to select the best covariance 
structure from compound symmetry and autoregressive-1 (AR(1)).  The Kenward-Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. 
Change from baseline in all continuous clinical laboratory test results will be tested using 
one sample t-tests with p-values presented along with the descriptive statistics at each 
assessment visit within each treatment group (note that pharmacodynamic biomarkers - CK for efficacy, fasting glucose and insulin for insulin resistance, and GLDH for safety - will be of special interest). 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA), version 20.  The incidence of AEs will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_1570], SOC and preferred term; treatment group, SOC, preferred term, and intensity (CTCAE v 4.03 grade); and treatment group, SOC, preferred term, and 
relationship to study drug.  Additional AE analyses will be at the subject level: the 
number of subjects who had any AE, the distribution of number of AEs per subject within a treatment group, worst intensity in a subject within a treatment group, highest level of relationship to study treatment for each subject within a treatment group.  Adverse events 
associated with suicidality and abuse potential will be listed.  Full details will be provided

11.3.1 Protocol Deviation Definitions 
Protocol deviations should be documented in accordance with the Manual of Operations. 
Protocol Deviation 
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures of a research protocol that has not been approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC. 
Changes or alterations in the conduct of the trial which do not have a major impact on the 
subject's rights, safety or well-being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the 
study data are considered minor protocol deviations. 
Important Protocol Deviation An important protocol deviation is a deviation from the IRB/IEC-approved protocol that 
may significantly affect the subject's rights, safety, or well-being and/or the 
completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data.  This includes examples such as 
inappropriate consent, errors in drug dosing, or lack of reporting of safety data.

Original Text: 
The primary efficacy outcome is TTSTAND (velocity) change from baseline to Week 24.  A sample size of 30 subjects per treatment group (120 total subjects) will detect a 0.0674 point difference in mean change 
from baseline to Week  24 in TTSTAND (velocity) between a vamorolone dose level and placebo, 
assuming a common standard deviation of 0.08, a two -sided t test, and a Type -I error of 0.025 with 
approximately 83% power.  The Bonferroni adjustment method will be used to control the Type -I error rate 
at 0.05 due to the multiple comparisons ([ADDRESS_571169] placebo).  
Based on th is calculation, a total of approximately 120 subjects will be randomized to treatment with 
vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day (n=30), vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day (n=30), prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day (n=30), or placebo (n=30).  
Revised Text: 
In the vamorolone VBP15 -003 study and the interim analysis of the VBP15 -LTE study, doses of 0.25 and 
0.75 mg/kg/day showed little evidence of clinical benefit, whereas doses of 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/day both 
showed clear evidence of clinical benefit comparable to that seen with glucocorticoids (prednisone and deflazacort).  
In consideration of the primary efficacy endpoint  in the c urrent study, comparison of 6.0 mg/kg/day 
vamorolone versus placebo, sample size calculations were performed using data from vamorolone -treated 
subjects from the VBP15 -002/VBP15- 003 24- week treatment period.  The analysis compared TTSTAND 
velocity from the combined 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/day groups ( Treatment  Group) to the combined 0.25 and 
0.75 mg/kg/day groups ( Pseudo -Placebo G roup).   
Least squares (LS ) means from the mixed model for repeated measures ( MMRM) modeling of VBP15 -
002/VBP15- 003 24- week data wer e used as parameter estimates of the population means in the sample size 
calculations for the comparison of the Treatment Group (2.0 + 6.0 mg/kg/day) vs. the Pseudo -Placebo 
Group (0.25 + 0.75 mg/kg/day) on the mean change from baseline at Week 24.  For the  estimates of 
standard deviations within each comparison group, simple descriptive statistics from the VBP15 -
002/VBP15- 003 24- week data were used.  Power was estimated using two -sided t- tests assuming unequal 
variance, with alpha =0.05.  
The following tabl e shows the resultant estimated power for various sample sizes per comparison group for 
comparing the Treatment Group (2.0 + 6.0 mg/kg/day) vs. the Pseudo -Placebo Group (0.25 + 0.75 
mg/kg/day) on the mean change from baseline at Week 24 for the alternative  hypothesis that H1: μ1 ≠ μ2

tested sequentially.  Further details are provided below.  
For primary efficacy (TTSTAND velocity), the two vamorolone dose leve ls will be compared with 
placebo.  To account for these comparisons (two vamorolone dose levels vs. placebo ), Bonferroni multiple

All evaluations of clinical efficacy will be listed and presented using descriptive statistics per treatment group and time point.  The primary efficacy outcome is TTSTAN D (velocity).  Secondary efficacy 
outcomes are the NSAA assessment, TTCLIMB, TTRW, 6MWT, hand- held myometry (elbow flexors and 
knee extensors), and ROM.  TTSTAND, TTCLIMB, and TTRW will be analyzed using raw scores and velocity.   
The primary efficacy outcome TTSTAND (velocity) change from baseline to Week  24 will be compared 
between each of the two different vamorolone dose groups and the placebo group using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) -based mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM).  This model includes 
fixed effects for treatment (vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day, vamorolone 6.0  mg/kg/day, prednisone 0.75 
mg/kg/day, and placebo), week, baseline TTSTAND, age group (per stratification), and the treatment -by-
week interaction.  Study week will be included in the model as a categorical variable (Weeks 6, 12, and 24) 
along with the treatment -by-week interaction.  Within this model, pairwise comparisons (using least 
squares [LS] mean contrasts) will be made to compare TTSTAND at 24 week s for each vamorolone dose 
level with placebo separately (primary efficacy outcome), for each vamorolone dose level with prednisone separately (secondary analysis), and for the high vamorolone dose level with the low vamorolone dose level (secondary analysis).  Treatments will also be compared at other weeks as secondary analyses.  An

Section 5.4: Rationale for Dose Selection, paragraph #5 
Original Text: 
Vamorolone at doses of 0.25 mg/kg/day, 0.75 mg/kg/day, 2.0 mg/kg/day and 
6.0 mg/kg/day has been demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated in a 2-week Phase IIa 
study (VBP15-002) in 4 to <7 years DMD boys.  The safety of these four doses continued to be studied in the 24-week Phase II extension study (VBP15-003) in 4 to 7 year-old DMD boys, and continues to be studied in the ongoing VBP15-LTE long-term extension 
study.  There were a total of 4 SAEs in the Phase II VBP15-003 study and three SAEs to 
date in the VBP15-LTE extension study: two SAEs of pneumonia in two different subjects (both subjects receiving vamorolone 0.75 mg/kg/day), one SAE of bilateral testicular torsion and one SAE of hypoxia in the same subject receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day, 
one SAE of influenza associated dehydration in a subject receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day, and 
two SAEs of acute myoglobinuria in the same subject receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day.  Each of these SAEs was considered unrelated to study drug, and none of them resulted in discontinuation from the study.  One subject receiving vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg in the 
Phase II extension study (VBP15-003) who had an incidental early morning cortisol drawn following an AE of presyncope had evidence of adrenal suppression.  In the VBP15-003 study, after 24 weeks of treatment, 0 of 8 tested participants (0.25 mg/kg/day), 1 of 12 (8.3%) tested participants (0.75 mg/kg/day), 5 of 12 (41.7%) tested 
participants (2.0 mg/kg/day), and 8 of 9 (88.9%) tested participants (6.0 mg/kg/day) had a 
depressed morning cortisol (<3.6 μg/dL [100 nM]) consistent with chronic adrenal suppression.
29  Thus, based on the available data in the Phase I and Phase II studies 
regarding the safety signal of suppression of the adrenal axis, the possibility of adrenal 
suppression is present in subjects at the 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/day dose levels.

will be compared between each of the two different vamorolone dose groups and the 
placebo group using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM).  This model includes fixed effects for treatment (vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day, vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day, prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day, and placebo), week, baseline TTSTAND, age group (per stratification), and the treatment-by-
week interaction.  Study week will be included in the model as a categorical variable 
(Weeks 6, 12, and 24) along with the treatment-by-week interaction.  Within this model, pairwise comparisons (using least squares [LS] mean contrasts) will be made to compare TTSTAND at 24 weeks for each vamorolone dose level with placebo separately (primary 
efficacy outcome), for each vamorolone dose level with prednisone separately (secondary 
analysis), and for the high vamorolone dose level with the low vamorolone dose level (secondary analysis).  Treatments will also be compared at other weeks as secondary analyses.  An unstructured covariance matrix will be used, and underlying modelling 
assumptions will be checked.  If differences between baseline characteristics exist 
between the three treatment groups in this comparison, it will be investigated if adjustment for these characteristics is clinically relevant and necessary.  The secondary outcome measures will be compared using similar models.

PPP.  Analyses will be done as per randomized treatment. 
All efficacy will be summarized and listed.  Where considered relevant, plots will be 
created. 
The primary efficacy outcome is Time to Stand (TTSTAND) from supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (velocity), 
comparison of vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day vs. placebo.  Secondary and exploratory 
efficacy outcomes are TTSTAND (velocity), comparison of vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day vs. placebo; the NSAA assessment; Time to Climb four stairs (TTCLIMB) (velocity); Time to Run/Walk 10 meters (TTRW) (velocity); the distance walked in 6 minutes 
(6MWT); hand-held myometry (elbow flexors and knee extensors); and ROM.  
The primary efficacy outcome TTSTAND (velocity) change from baseline to Week 24 
will be compared between the 6.0 mg/kg/day vamorolone dose group and the placebo group using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM).  This model includes fixed effects for treatment (vamorolone 2.0 
mg/kg/day, vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day, prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day, and placebo), week, baseline TTSTAND, age group (per stratification), and the treatment-by-week interaction.  Study week will be included in the model as a categorical variable (Weeks 6, 
12, and 24) along with the treatment-by-week interaction.  Within this model, pairwise 
comparisons (using least squares [LS] mean contrasts) will be made to compare TTSTAND velocity at 24 week s for the vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day dose level with 
placebo (primary efficacy outcome).   
For secondary outcomes, the same models will be used as for the primary outcome 
(REML-based MMRM including fixed effects for treatment [vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day, 
vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day, prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day, and placebo], age group [<6 years; ≥ 6 years], week, baseline, and treatment-by-week interaction). 
An unstructured covariance matrix will be used, and underlying modelling assumptions 
will be checked.  If differences between baseline characteristics exist between the treatment groups, it will be investigated if adjustment for these characteristics is clinically

models.   Full details will be provided in the SAP. 
The following sensitivity analyses will be performed (see SAP for full details) for the primary efficacy and secondary efficacy endpoints: 
• Multiple imputations using MCMC methods for missing data; 
• Multiple imputations using a Control-based Pattern-Mixture Model for missing 
data. 
Additional sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on 
the primary endpoint.  Supportive analyses will also be performed on the primary 
endpoint.  Full details will be provided in the SAP. 
Subjects who are randomized to receive vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day or vamorolon e 
6.0 mg/kg/day for both treatment periods will have TTSTAND velocity change from 
baseline data captured over 48 weeks compared with untreated DMD historical control 
data.  Full details will be provided in the SAP. 
Section Changed: 
Section 10.9.5: Safety Analyses, paragraphs #3-5 
Original Text: 
Safety data will include BMI, weight, vital signs, 2D-echocardiogram, DXA scan, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
X-ray, eye examination results, and ACTH Stimulation Test results, and ECG results, and 
these will be presented using descriptive statistics.  Safety laboratory data will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics, and out-of-range values will be listed.  For safety analyses, the vamorolone doses will be compared to prednisone.   
In Treatment Period #1, BMI z-score change from baseline data captured over 24 weeks 
will be compared for subjects who are randomized to receive vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day 
or vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day vs. subjects randomized to receive prednisone.  The same 
MMRM that is used for the primary efficacy analysis will be used for BMI z-score.  The test for statistical significance will be performed at the 0.05 level.  Subjects who are randomized to receive vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day or vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day for both

Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA), version 20.  The incidence of AEs will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_1570], SOC and preferred term; treatment group, SOC, preferred term, and 
intensity (CTCAE v 4.03 grade); and treatment group, SOC, preferred term, and 
relationship to study drug.  Additional AE analyses will be at the subject level: the number of subjects who had any AE, the distribution of number of AEs per subject within a treatment group, worst intensity in a subject within a treatment group, highest level of 
relationship to study treatment for each subject within a treatment group.

In Treatment Period #1, BMI z-score change from baseline results will be compared 
between treatment groups using an REML-based MMRM analysis with treatment group, week of the visit, and the treatment-by-week interaction as factors, and baseline BMI z-score and age group as a covariate.  Week will be included in the model as a categorical 
variable (Week 12 and 24) along with the treatment-by-week interaction.  An 
unstructured within-subject covariance matrix will be used.  If this analysis fails to converge, Akaike’s information criterion will be used to select the best covariance structure from compound symmetry and autoregressive-1 (AR(1)).  The Kenward-Roger 
approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. 
Change from baseline in all continuous clinical laboratory test results will be tested using 
one sample t-tests with p-values presented along with the descriptive statistics at each

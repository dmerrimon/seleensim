1.1 Berg Protocol CTL0211 
Study Title: A multi- center,  Phase 1, dose- escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability 
and pharmacokinetics of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_633220]31543 ( Calcitriol , USP) in adult cancer patients 
receiving t axane -based chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced or recurrent 
disease. 
This w ill be a dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the 
overall safety and tolerability of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_633220] [ZIP_CODE] (Calcitriol) in  patients with a 
diagnosis of early stage or locally advanced, unresectable and/or metastatic cancer, or patients with operable cancer, who are scheduled to receive follow up treatment with a taxane -based 
chemotherapy regimen (either pre-operatively or post-operatively), as per physician’s 
discretion .A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be employed with 3 -6 patients at each dose 
level. Eligible patients ≥18 years of age and scheduled to receive a taxane -based regimen with 
treatment breaks as per physician’s discretion, will start applying the topi[INVESTIGATOR_633221] a day 
at each cohort dose level two weeks or 7 days ±  2 days prior to initiation of chemotherapy and 
then continue twice daily for 3 months or until termination of chemotherapy treatment. If topi[INVESTIGATOR_633222]/or diminishing taxane chemotherapy-induced 
alopecia as determined by [CONTACT_633287] -assessments, patients 
will be allowed to continue topi[INVESTIGATOR_633223], assuming no dose l imiting t oxicities (DLTs) related to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_633224]. Toxicity to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_633220] [ZIP_CODE] (c alcitriol)  will be assessed on a weekly 
basis during the first 28 days of topi[INVESTIGATOR_633225] a study 
clinician, either a physician or a nurse. For the purpose of pharmacokinetic studies (PKs), blood samples will be collected on Day 1 of topi[INVESTIGATOR_633226]: pre -dose, at 
2 hrs (±30 minutes), 4 hr s (±30 minutes), and 8 hr s (±[ADDRESS_845516] dose) after a single application on 
the morning of Day 1. The second application of drug product will be applied 10-14 hr s after the 
initial application and after the 8 hr PK sample. Thereafter, topi[INVESTIGATOR_633227], morning and night. Subsequently, a PK sample will be taken 12 hr s (±2 hr s) after the 
last dose of each 28-day treatment, before the first application of Day 1 of the next 28- day 
treatment cycle. This schedule will continue for three consecutive 28- day topi[INVESTIGATOR_633228] . (PKs will be drawn at Week s 1, 5, 9, and 13. In addition, if patients are still on study, a 
PK will also be drawn at Week  54.)  
As a secondary objective, potential efficacy of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_633229]. Photographic assessment will be performed using a Canon digital camera system to ensure standardization and uniformity among all enrolled patients. The following five views will be obtained at each photographic assessment: bilateral sides of head/scalp view, front of head/face view, back of head/scalp view, and top of head/scalp view .Additionally, close-up photographs will be taken at the same time points. They will include 
the mid -pattern of the scalp from a superior view and a vertex view with hair parted in the center 
and combed away from the center part. Photographs will be standardized for lighting, camera angle, and position to the participant’ s head.These  assessments will be performed at the 
following time points: at baseline, Week s 7, 15, 27, and 54. Photographs for patients in each 
cohort representing baseline, and treatment Week s [ADDRESS_845517] daily application details of the medication. This will include application dates and times, c hemotherapy cycle, and whether the medication was 
applied (or reason if the medication was not applied). The self- assessment diary will require  
assessment of hair thickness, hair fullness, hair breakage, and hair cosmetic qualities (ease of styling, etc.) on an analog [ADDRESS_845518] over a period of approximately 12 months, including the screening period.

Page 7 of 54 2 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
2.1 Primary Objective  
• To determine the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) and the overall safety and 
tolerability of topi[INVESTIGATOR_633230] [ZIP_CODE](C alcitriol, USP) in adult cancer patients receiving 
taxane -based chemotherapy regimens .  
2.2 Secondary Objective s 
• To determine the single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of Compound [ZIP_CODE] at 
different dose levels . 
• To evaluate preliminary efficacy of Compound [ADDRESS_845519] common and distressing dermatolo gical adverse events  associated with the use of many 
different chemotherapeutic agents. Taxanes (paclitaxel / docetaxel) , doxorubicin, 
cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil can cause alopecia in >80%, 60%-100%, >60%, and 10%-
50% of patients, respectively.1 Among women undergoing therapy with paclitaxel monotherapy, 
alopecia can be observed in up to 82% of patients.2,3 CIA is believed to occur when hair follicles 
are in anagen phase and results in anagen effluvium due to toxicity of chemotherapy and its metabolites on the hair follicle.
1 CIA typi[INVESTIGATOR_366541] 1 -3 weeks and is complete at 1 -2 months 
after the initiation of chemotherapy. This type of hair loss is usually reversible after the 
completion of therapy, with regrowth that occurs after a de lay of 3 -6 months. Nevertheless, the 
new hair often demonstrates changes in its color, structure, and texture with growth rate that may be significantly reduced.
1 This particular toxicity has signific ant psychosocial and quality-of- life 
consequences. It negatively affects patients’ perception of physical appearance, body image, sexuality, and self -esteem .
5-7 More importantly, among women, 58% consider it the most 
disturbing reaction and 8% are at risk of avoiding therapy due to this toxicity.8 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_633231], to date no effective preventative or treatment options  are available. 
One approach, scalp -cooling, has been investigated since 1970s and has shown to diminish CIA. 
However, there is a lack of adequate clinical data with only 7 out of 53 conducted trials that were 
randomized, and further clinical and biochemical research is needed.9 Scalp cooling has been 
used to treat CIA.10 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_8580] 2% topi[INVESTIGATOR_633232].11 While 
multiple other ex perimental approaches are being investigated, no pharmacologic agent has been 
approved for prevention or treatment of CIA.1 
3.2 Calcitriol, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 
Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis through its actions in the 
intestine, kidney, and parathyroid glands. These actions are mediated by [CONTACT_633288], hormonal form, 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) .
[ADDRESS_845520] the cell cycle and reduce the sensitivity 
of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_633233]. Unlike androgenetic alopecia, CIA occurs due to massive anagen effluvium attributed  to toxicity of chemotherapy and their metabolites on the hair follicle 
cells. The rapid cell proliferation in hair follicles during anagen renders hair follicles susceptible

Page 9 of 54 to the toxicity of chemotherapy. Therefore, one approach to prevent CIA is to inhibit cell 
proliferation in order to diminish the sensitivity of hai r follicles to chemotherapy.  
3.3 Pre-clinical Studies  
3.3.1 Animal Studies  
Both CIA and alopecia areata ( AA) have been extensively studied due to the availability of 
animal  models which closely mimic the diseases in the human. In this regard, it was previously 
demonstrated that alopecic  chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (cytarabine,  cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, etoposide) induce alopecia in the neonatal rat model (Sprague Dawley rats). In this model, rats of 8 to 11 days of age are injected intraperitoneally with chemotherapy. Alopecia ensues 5 -7 days later, and is graded depending on the hair loss 
observed. The protective compounds are given on Day 5 after birth for 6 days. This model is 
useful to study CIA because the hair follicles at this stage are in 100% anagen, which renders them susceptible to chemotherapy toxicity and is comparable to the human setting.
17-[ADDRESS_845521] of chemotherapy is an adult C57BL/[ADDRESS_845522] gone through several postnatal growth cycles and the hair shafts are pi[INVESTIGATOR_49194], similar to the human scalp .
1 The anagen cycle in this particular model is induced by [CONTACT_61911][INVESTIGATOR_633234] 8 to 9 days after the procedure. Using this model and cyclophosphamide, it has been demonstrated that as a response to cytotoxicity of chemotherapy, the hair follicle utilizes two pathways: dystrophic anagen or dystrophic catagen, which determines the onset of chemotherapy -induced alopecia and the pattern of hair re-growth.
[ADDRESS_845523] gone through several cycles and rats possess both pi[INVESTIGATOR_191268]-pi[INVESTIGATOR_633235]. Additionally, the induction of anagen phase is performed by [CONTACT_633289], the method that may avoid the trauma to th e hair follicles that is induced by [CONTACT_61911][INVESTIGATOR_344]. Another 
excellent model to study alopecia, more specifically, AA, has been the C3H/HeJ mouse model.
20 
In this model, 20% of the animals spontaneously develop alopecia in clusters or throughout the entire body (alopecia universalis) by [ADDRESS_845524]- Chemotherapy Alopecia (PCA) andAA . The 
overall goal of this project was to determine if 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3could be used to treat 
alopecia in general.  
The results of pre- clinical studie s strongly suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 exerts a protectiveeffect 
against chemotherapy -induced alopecia, but it does not treat alopecia itself. The rationale behind 
the preventive effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 in CIA is that healthy hair follicles can be arrested and thereby [CONTACT_633290]. However, in hair follicles that are already apoptotic, treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 does not offer any benefit.

21 Another experiment conducted with BALB/c mice, the 
animal model which allows investigating the hair follicles in the first adult anagen phase and evaluate gender differences, demonstrated that topi[INVESTIGATOR_633237] [ADDRESS_845525] from cyclophosphamide -induced follicular damage.
22 However, in this model, no 
significant differences in apoptosis staining pattern were noted between mice treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_633238]. 
On the other hand, another animal study using the female C57BL/[ADDRESS_845526] been due to hair follicles favoring the “dystrophic catagen pathway” of response to chemical injury: fol licular repair strategy allowing for the 
unusually fast reconstruction of a new, undamaged anagen hair bulb.

No statistically significant difference in the survival rate was seen between Sprague Dawley rats transplanted with chloroleukemia C51 cells pretreated with 0.2μg of 1,25(OH)2D3 and those pretreated with an ethanol vehicle prior to cyclophosphamide treatment .
[ADDRESS_845528] tumor- bearing male mice prior to intraperitoneal 
administration of cyclophosphamide resulted in the greater reduction in the rate of tumor growth as compared to mice treated with either agent alone, suggesting potential an ti-tumor effects of 
calcitriol. Similarly , pretreatment with 2.5 μg of calcitriol 3 doses daily for 3 days, followed by

The data suggests that the amount measured  in the reservoir solution is slightly greater  than the 
amount of endogenous c alcitriol that may be present (which is being released from the skin into 
the reservoir solution) and does not differentiate the topi[INVESTIGATOR_29899]. However, no 
endogenous c alcitriol was measured in non-dosed chambers for the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], dermis and 
surface wash samples, indicating that the amount that is measured in those compartments from the dosed skin sections is from the applied dose. This is further supported by [CONTACT_633293] 3 µg/mL c alcitriol versus those with 1 µg/mL concentration. The 
formulations showed a range of approximately 10-20% of drug penetration into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], based on the applied dose, but little to no penetration into the dermis (1% or less of applied dose). 
Prototype formulation CAR-03-031 containing API # [ZIP_CODE] (c alcitriol) in a vehicle of propylene 
glycol and d ehydrated alcohol, 200 proof in a 40/60 ratio (W/W) , has been identified as the 
prototype formulation for further development. 
3.4 Clinical S tudies  
One Phase 1 trial of topi[INVESTIGATOR_633242] ( calcitriol ) has been conducted. In this study, patients with 
stage II -IV breast cancer were scheduled to receive cyclophosphamide 500mg/m
2, doxorubicin 
50mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil 500mg/m2 on Day  [ADDRESS_845529] 5 days of treatment and by 
[CONTACT_76409] a family member thereafter. The  cream was rubbed around the entire scalp and was 
maintaine d without washing for 8 hr s. Three different doses were evaluated: [ADDRESS_845530]-chemotherapy. Treatment was continued until the appearance of grade 2 alopecia, as graded by [CONTACT_633294] -CTCE. Patients’ serum and urine calcium excretion were monitored. 
Overall, there were [ADDRESS_845531] to pre -treat for 7 days ±  [ADDRESS_845532] dermatitis in the majority of treated patients. The formulation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_633220]31543 (c alcitriol ) that will be employed in this proposed trial is an anhydrous alcohol 
and glycol based formulation with penetration characteristics that favors epi[INVESTIGATOR_633243].  
Another trial investigated the potential of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_237949] D analogue, calcipotriol, in preventing chemotherapy- induced alopecia. Patients with breast cancer undergoing therapy with 
cyclophosphamide 600mg/m
2, methotrexate 40mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil 600mg/m2 given on 
Days 1 and 8 in a 4- weekly  cycle were randomized to receive either topi[INVESTIGATOR_633244] 50 μ g/mL or a vehicle. The solution was applied twice daily from [ADDRESS_845533] of topi[INVESTIGATOR_633245], hair shedding rates, and hair regrowth of hair density.
25 
The lack of interference of c alcitriol  with the efficacy of chemotherapy and the ability to 
potentiate its cytotoxic effects, previously demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo animal models, has also been d emonstrated by [CONTACT_166850]. This was demonstrated by a P hase 2 
randomized controlled trial of patients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer who received weekly docetaxel with DN -101(high-dose c alcitriol, 45 μg) versus placebo. The  primary 
objective of this study was to evaluate the proportion of patients achieving PSA response ( ≥ 50% 
PSA reduction, confirmed  at least 4weeks later) in the two treatment arms. DN -101 (45μg) or 
placebo was administered orally on Day 1 followed by [CONTACT_633295] 36mg/m
2intravenously on Day2 
Protocol CTL0211   Amendment 9   02 November 2015

Page 14 of 54 along with dexamethasone (4mgorally 12 hrs before, 1 hr before, and 12 hr s after docetaxel 
administration).This regimen was administered weekly for [ADDRESS_845534] dose of docetaxel (Week  1, Cycle 1 only) was attenuated (27 
mg/m2) to collect additional safety data for the combination of DN-101 with docetaxel. Two 
hundred-ﬁfty patients were randomly assigned (125 patients in each arm). PSA decline 
(≥50%conﬁrmed 4weeks later) within 6 months of enrollment was reached in 49% of placebo 
treated patients and 58%of DN-101- treated patients (P=0.16). At anytime while on study, this 
end point was achieved in 52% of placebo treated patients and 63% of DN-101- treated patients 
(P=0.07). Measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 
Version 1.0)was present in 59 of placebo-treated patients (47%) and 48 of DN-101 treated 
patients (38%). Tumor response was seen in 14 (24%) and 14 (29%) of placebo and DN-101-treated patients, respectively (P=0.51). Overall survival showed a promising improvement in the DN-101 group over the placebogroup withaHRof 0.67 (95%CI, 0.45 to 0.97;P=0.04).The addition of calcitriol was associated with a reduction in the risk of death by [CONTACT_633296] .
26 Overall, no increase in toxicity was seen with the addition of DN-101 to docetaxel. 
Toxici ties that might be expected with administration of supraphysiologic doses of c alcitriol  
were uncommon with weekly administration ofDN-101 except for mild  hypercalcemia. Six 
percent of placebo -treated patients and 7% of DN-101- treated patients had grade 1 to 2 creatinine 
elevation, 8% of placebo-treated patients and 33%of DN-101- treated patients had transient 
hypercalcemia. All the hypercalcemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_633246] -101 arm were grade 1 and 
required no intervention, and did not result in dose reduction or delay in therapy. No patients on placebo and one patient on DN- 101 experienced symptomatic renal calcul i. Interestingly, the 
incidence of any grade 3 or 4 adverse events was 70% in placebo treated patients and 58% in DN-101 treated patients (P=0.065). Adverse effects leading to discontinuation of therapy were seen in 28% of placebo- treated patients and 22% of DN -101- treatedpatients. Serious adverse 
events, generally those requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], were observed in 41% of placebo- treated 
patients and 27% of DN-101- treated patients (P=0.023).
26 The incidence of docetaxel -induced 
alopecia was comparable between the two arms. The incidence of all -grade alopecia was 41% 
and 45% in the docetaxel plus placebo arm and DN-[ADDRESS_845535], the follow-up randomized Phase 3 trial of high -dose c alcitriol in combination with 
weekly docetaxel as compared with placebo in combination with docetaxel administered every three weeks, showed that treatment with calcitriol was associated with significantly shorter 
survival.953 men with castration resistant prostate cancer were randomized to 45 µg DN-101, 36 mg/m
2docetaxel, and 24 mg dexamethasone weekly  (ASCENT arm , 477 patients ) for 3 out of 
every 4 weeks  or control arm (476 patients, 5 mg prednisone twice a day, and 75 
mg/m2docetaxel  and 24 mg dexamethasone every 3 weeks). The primary endpoint was overall 
survival. At an interim analysis, more deaths were observed in the ASCENT arm, and the trial was halted early . Median overall survival was 16.8 months (95% CI, 15.8-19.3) for ASCENT 
subjects and 19.9 months (95% CI, 18.6- 22.7) for controls. In multivariate analysis adjusting for

side effects of docetaxel. Dose modification for docetaxel  toxicity was more frequent in the 
ASCENT arm (229 ASCENT vs. 160 control subjects).The shorter survival in the ASCENT arm was potentially  attributed to inferior efficacy of weekly docetaxel administration as compared to

Phase 1 Dosing Rationale: The NOAEL (no -‐observed -‐adverse -‐effect -‐level) in the non--
‐clinical animal studies was 10.31 µg/mL. To compare the animal and human doses of C31543, 
a margin of safety (MOS) was calculated using the NOAEL dose in the 4 -‐week minipig study 
and the initial dose in the Phase 1 clinical trial. In minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], the NOAEL, 10.31 µg/mL is 
equivalent to a dose of 3.33 µg/kg (10.31 µg/mL x 2.1 mL (dose volume) x 2X/day ÷ 13 kg 
[average weight of minipi[INVESTIGATOR_633262] 4]).  In humans, the starting dose was 5 µg/mL x 1 mL 2X/day ÷ 60kg=0.166). Based on these doses, the MOS was 20 which was an adequate margin over the initial clinical dose (5 µg/ml). The daily dose for 40 µ g/ml x 1mL BID is 1.33 µ g/kg, at 
60 µg/ml x 1ml BID the daily dose is 2.00 µ g/kg, and at 80 µg/ml x 1mL BID 2.67 µ g/kg, all 
below the calculated NOAEL of 3.33 µ g/kg.

Meaning, they must wash their hair after every other application of Compound [ZIP_CODE].Pati ents will self -administer the topi[INVESTIGATOR_633265]; except for first dose, in which case application of topi[INVESTIGATOR_633266]. On  days when pharmacokinetic studies will be performed, patients will self -

8.1 Taxane- Based Chemotherapy Administration  
All patients should be pre- medicated prior to administration of the chemotherapeutic agents  in 
order to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactio ns, per institutional guidelines . The taxane 
regimen chosen is at the treating physician’s discretion and should be standard for the patient’s cancer type. The taxane regimen chosen should not change significantly while on study and receiving C31543 although dose reductions are allowed for toxicities related to chemotherapy. 
8.2 Dose Escalation 
Patients will be treated with the topi[INVESTIGATOR_633218] [ZIP_CODE] (Calcitriol, USP) in cohorts of size 
three to six starting at dose level 1 (5  μg/mL). The dosage will be escalated if the clinical toxicity 
is declared acceptable (see below). Two dose levels were considered for escalation (10 and 20 μg/mL).  These dose levels were completed without DLT.  Amendment 8 will add additional 
dosing levels unt il MTD is achi eved (40, 60, 80, μg /mL.)Determination of dose limiting toxicity 
(DLT, defined in S ection 8.4) will be made during the first 28 days of topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786]. No 
intra-patient dose escalation will be performed. DLT will need to possibly, probably or definitely 
(defined in Section 8.4) be related to topi[INVESTIGATOR_633268]. The dose escalation scheme ( Table 3 ) will occur 
as follows: 
One 28-day cycle of treatment will be performed and evaluation of PK Data will occur before 
escalation to the next dose level.  
If none of the initial three patients in a cohort experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then a 
new cohort of three patients will be treated at the next higher dose level.  
If one of the three patients in a cohort experiences DLT, then up to three additional patients will be treated at the same dose level. Escalation  will continue if a maximum of  one of the six 
patients experiences DLT.  
Protocol CTL0211   Amendment 9   02 November 2015  
 
Confidential Property of Berg, LLC  
Page 24 of 54 If two or more patients in a cohort experience DLT, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
will have been exceeded, and no further dose escalation will occur. The previous dose level will be considered as the MTD.  
If only three patients were treated at a dose level under consideration as the MTD, then up to 
three additional patients will be accrued to that dose level. If  no more than one of six patients at 
that dose level experience a DLT, then that dose level will be confirmed as the MTD.If  two or 
more patients in that cohort experience DLT, then the previous dose level will be studied in the same fashion.  
The MTD is defined as the dose level at which 0/3 or 1/[ADDRESS_845555] 28-days treatment cycle below the dose at which 2/3 or 2/[ADDRESS_845556] been exceeded when >30% (2/3 or 2/6) of subjects at any dose level develop DLT. If the MTD is not established after completing three cohorts of escalating doses, the study Sponsor will review the study findings with FDA Division of Dermatology to seek guidance as to amending the study protocol to add additional dose- escalating cohorts.  
The Cohort Revie w Committee ( CRC), comprised of the Berg medical monitor, Berg  CMO and 
SVP of Regulatory Affairs  or designee, and the principal investigator(s), will be fully aware of 
clinical and laboratory data, and must agree if dose escalation to the next cohort is appropriate. Pharmacokinetic data from each treatment cohort will also be reviewed by [CONTACT_633301]- escalate. Adverse event data from the treatment extension 
period will be presented, when available (at least monthly), to the CRC. These data will be considered for dose escalation decisions. In the event that MTD has not been reached after three cohorts have been treated, any further dose escalations will require a protocol amendment.  
The CRC will review all available data fro m previous cohorts to assure that the actual dose 
escalation determined in this fashion does not expose subjects to unreasonable risk. The CRC 
may reduce or halt dose escalations for any reason ( eg, observation of non-linear PK, AEs in 
subjects who receive more than one dose of C31543 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198]). The decision to proceed with the next cohort will require unanimous agreement of the members of the CRC. 
The nonclinical toxicology has been reviewed and the C ohort 1 drug concentration established 
by [CONTACT_633302] , LLC and the FDA is approximately 1/[ADDRESS_845557] to discontinue the 
study.

Page 39 of 54 13 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL  FROM STUDY  
All patients may continue therapy unless DLT  is documented. In case of death, the cause of 
death should be documented.  
The following events may be considered sufficient reason for discont inuing treatment with the 
study medication:  
• Serious toxicity due to the study drug graded according to the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 
• Conditions requiring therapeutic intervention not permitted by [CONTACT_760] 
• Unacceptable toxicity in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_633276]  
• Personal preference by [CONTACT_633312]  
• Subject non- compliance with the defined treatment plan  
• Medical or psychiatric illness Any other situation wh ere, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the patient or further therapy is not possible  
• Pregnancy  
• Loss of all of the patient’s hair after the first three cycles of topi[INVESTIGATOR_633277]. 
The investigator may withdraw a subject if, in his or her clinical judgment, it is in the best interest of the subject or if the subject cannot comply with the protocol. When possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the termination visit should be carried out. Berg should be notified of all subject withdrawals as soon as possible. 
If a subject fails to return for the protocol defined visits, an effort must be made to determine the 
reason. If the subject cannot be reached by [CONTACT_756], a registered letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the subject (or the subject’s legal guardian) requesting contact [CONTACT_194671]. This 
information should be recorded in the CRF. 
The investigator will also withdraw a subject upon Berg ’s request or if Berg  chooses to terminate 
the study. Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable adverse effect , the principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_633278]. If a subject is discontinued due to an adverse effect , the 
event will be followed until it is resolved, or if not resolved within a reasonable time 
(approximately 30 days), until its clinical relevance and etiology can be reasonably explained. A subject may withdraw his or her consent at any time during the study. 
If a subject withdraws from the study at any time either at his or her request or at the principal 
investigator’s discretion, the reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the CRF. All subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely will undergo all end -of-study assessments, if possible.  
Every effort must be made to undertake protocol- specified safety follow -up procedures.

Page 40 of 54 14 BIOSTATISTICS  
This is a Phase 1 study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of C31543 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_633279]. Three doses of topi[INVESTIGATOR_633269] ( 5 μg/mL, 10 μ g/mL, and 
20 μg/mL) have been tested to date without DLT.  Amendment 8 adds additional dosing levels 
(40 μg /mL, 60 μg /mL 80 μg /mL)until MTD is achieved.   
Patients will be treated in cohorts of size three to six and the dosage will be escalated if the clinical toxicity is acceptable. A patient is considered toxicity -free for the purpose of the trial if 
s/he completes the first month  of topi[INVESTIGATOR_633280] (DLT). If the topi[INVESTIGATOR_633281], an additional patient may be enrolled at that dose level to ensure adequate evalua tion of 
toxicity. No intra -patient dose escalation will be performed. In all cases, including those when 
the topi[INVESTIGATOR_633282] [ADDRESS_845578]  month. DLT is defined in Section 8.4and the design is constructed 
to minimize the chances of escalating the dose when the probability of DLT is high, and maximize the chance of escalating the dose when the probability of DLT is low. The dose escalation scheme is as follows:  
1. If none of the initial three patients at a given dose level experience DLT, the next dose level will be studied.  
2. If one of the initial three patients at a given dose level experiences DLT, three additional patients will be treated at the same dose level. Escalation will continue only if there has been no additional DLT observed. 
3. If two or more patients experience DLT at a given dose, the previous dose will be declared the  MTD.  
4. If only three patients were treated at a dose under consideration as MTD, an additional three patients will be treated at that level to confirm previous results.  
The probability that dose escalation will occur at any stage during MTD determination, is a 
function of the underlying DLT rate at the current dose level. This probability can be calculated as the sum of the binomial probabilities of the following two outcomes that would permit escalation to occur:  
1. No DLT observed in the first three patients.  
2. One DLT is observed in the first three patients followed by [CONTACT_633313].  
The true risk of toxicity is expected to be in the range of 10%-50%.The following table shows the corresponding proba bilities of dose escalation:  
True Risk of Toxicity 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 
Probability of Escalation  0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 
 
These numbers show the probability of escalating to the next dose level is large when the 
underlying true toxicity rate is small and the probability of escalating decreases appropriately as the true toxicity rate increases.

14.1 Safety Analyses 
Selected non -hematologic and hematologic toxicities, as measured by [CONTACT_633314] (CTCAE v 4.0), will be described by [CONTACT_633315], by [CONTACT_540281], with the maximum grade over all cycles used as the summary 
measure per patient.  
Adverse event terms recorded on the CRF will be mapped to preferred terms using the medical dictionary for regulatory activ ities (MedDRA) dictionary. All adverse events (AEs) will be listed 
or tabulated for overall incidence and for incidence for each dose cohort, worst reported severity, and relationship to study treatment according to system organ class and preferred term. Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be similarly summarized. Listings of deaths, SAEs, DLTs, and AEs leading to early termination of study treatment, or premature withdrawal from trial will also be provided. 
Laboratory variables will be examined using mean change in value from baseline to various time 
points for each dose cohort. Laboratory values will also be categorized according to the CTCAE v4.0; listings or tables will be categorized by [CONTACT_633316] -study toxicity grade, dose cohort, and 
relationship. Shift tables will be presented to show the number and percent of subjects with high, normal, and low (or normal/abnormal) laboratory results at baseline and last assessment. 
Concomitant medications will be summarized for all subjects, inclu ding summary by [CONTACT_167623]. 
14.[ADDRESS_845579] and patient self -reported diaries will be used 
for preliminary statistical analyses. Analyses will look at the efficacy of Topi[INVESTIGATOR_633218] 
C31543. This will be helpful for further studies looking more closely at the efficacy of C31543. 
While no formal statistical testing is planned for this study, 95% confidence intervals may be 
calculated for selected safety variables. This Phase [ADDRESS_845580], and descriptive statistics (including 
number, mean, median, standard deviation, and range) will be calculated for subjects by [CONTACT_15994] .

Page 46 of 54 17 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
Any clinical AE or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious and that occurs during the 
course of the study, irrespective of the treatment received by [CONTACT_423], must be reported to Berg  (or designee) within 24 hr s of awareness of the event(expedited reporting). 
The definition and reporting requirements of the International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2A will be adhered to. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death . 
• Is life threatening ( ie, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the AE places the subject at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death). 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is an important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment , may 
jeopardize the subject or may not be immediately life -threatening, or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above ( eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home for allergic  bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse). 
17.1 SAE Rep orting  
Any SAE, whether or not considered to be related to treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_633283] 24 hrs from  awareness of the event to Berg  (or designee) and will be recorded on 
both the SAE initial report form and the CRF. The outcome of the SAE, and medications or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, will be recorded on the appropriate CRF page. Forms for reporting SAEs and SAE Report Completion Guidelines will be provided to the study sites.  
All SAEs that occur after the  first dose of topi[INVESTIGATOR_633284], will 
be reported in accordance with US regulations governing safety reporting (21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32 and 312.33). 
Reporting of SAEs by [CONTACT_633320] (IRB) will be done in 
accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB. Adequate documentation must be maintained showing that the IRB was properly notified. 
For notification of an SAE, the following individual m ust be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]:

conclusion of the t rial;  
• Whether the authorization contains an expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]; and  
• The rights of a research patient to revoke his or her authorization.  
In the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], re tains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of patient 
authorization. For patients that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (ie, that the patient is alive) at the end of their scheduled trial period.  
In compliance with ICH GCP guidelines and applicable parts of [ADDRESS_845588] access to review the patient‘s original  medical records at the site 
for verification of trial -related procedures and data.  
Measures to protect confidentiality include: 
• Only a unique trial number and initials will identify patients on the CRF or other documents submitted to Berg.  
• This information, together with the patient‘s date of birth, will be used in the database for 
patient identification.  
•  Patient‘s name [CONTACT_633328].  
•  No material bearing a patient‘s name [CONTACT_96044] [CONTACT_633302].  
• Patients  will be informed of their rights within the ICF.

IRB at the investigator’s facility for the Board’s approval. 
It should be further noted that, if an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the trial 
design or the potential risks to the patients, their consent to continue participation in the trial should be obtained. 
19.2 Trial Documentation and Storage 
Source documents are the original documents, data, records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_1930], observations and ac tivities from which the patient‘s CRF data are 
obtained. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_633285]- related (essential) 
documentation, suitable for inspection at any time by [CONTACT_633321]/or applicable regulatory authorities. This should contain at a minimum all relevant documents and correspondence as outlined in ICH GCP Section [ADDRESS_845590] marketing application has been approved by [CONTACT_8415]; or, in the event that the marketing application has not been approved by [CONTACT_8415], for no less than [ADDRESS_845591] shipment/delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and FDA has been notified of the discontinuation. 
If the investigator relocates, retires,  or for any reason withdraws from the trial, both Berg and its 
representative should be prospectively notified. The trial records must be transferred to an 
acceptable designee, such as another investigator, another institution, or Berg. The investigator must obtain the Sponsor‘s written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention 
requirements have been met. All trial files will be maintained by [CONTACT_633322], and will be transferred to Berg at the conclusion of the trial. 
19.3 Data Collection 
The trial e CRF is the primary data collection instrument for the trial. eCRFs will be completed 
using the English language and should be kept current to enable the monitor to review the 
patient‘s status throughout the cours e of the trial.  
All data requested on the eCRF must be supported by [CONTACT_64388]‘s source documentation. All missing data must be explained. For any entry errors made, the error(s) must be corrected, and a note explaining the reason for change should be provided. The investigator will electronically sign and date the patient eCRF casebook indicating that the data in the e CRF 
has been assessed.

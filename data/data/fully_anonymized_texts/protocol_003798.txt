The proportion of subjects  having at least one AE within  each of 
these six AE subgroups will be summarized descriptively.  
Furthermore, the proportion of subjects having AEs within each 
of these 6 AE subgroups will be summarized by [CONTACT_2946], PT and 
severity (mild, moderate or severe) for the most severe rating of 
each AE per subject. And, the AE rate per 100 HemoCare ™ 
Hemodialysis System treatments will be calculated.  
 
Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for the visit 
values and change from baseline in monthly laboratory 
assessments. Baseline observation data for all assessments are 
defined in section 11.[ADDRESS_294304]-[ZIP_CODE]-001. 
Study Population:  All subjects who complete DEKA Protocol DKPL -[ZIP_CODE] -001 
and meet all of the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria will 
be eligible to enroll into this extension study.  
Study Duration:  Unless subject participation is  discontinued prior to market 
authorization (e.g., subject withdrawal, investigator decision, 
Sponsor decision), enrolled subjects may continue treatment in 
this protocol until the HemoCare™ Hemodialysis System 
obtains market authorization.  
Study Design and 
Methodology: This is an open -label  rollover  study  for subjects  and care partners 
who have completed DEKA Protocol DKPL -[ZIP_CODE]- 001. Enrolled 
subjects will continue to receive home hemodialysis per clinician 
prescription . Subjects will be seen  in the clinic for monthly labs 
which, at a minimum, would include: hemoglobin,   BUN,   
creatinine,   electrolytes,   calcium,   and phosphorus. Water  
sampling will be done annually or as required  by [CONTACT_242605], ultrapure (water or dialysate) sampling will be 
done quarterly or as required by [CONTACT_242606], 
and venous line infusion quality dialysate sampling will be done 
monthly.

Inclusion Cri teria:  All of the following criteria must be met for the subject to be 
eligible for participation. This study will enroll subjects who: 
1. Completed DEKA Protocol DKPL -[ZIP_CODE]- 001 and are 
qualified to enter the study based on the assessment of 
the Investigator.  
2. Are willing  to comply and capable of complying with the 
study requirements for therapy with the HemoCare™ 
Hemodialysis  System.  
3. Have a trained study care partner able to support subject

4. Subject  and care partner  can read and understand English 
and provide written informed consent. 
5. Have a stable  functioning vascular  access  as judged  by 
[CONTACT_1963].  
Exclusion Criteria:  If any  of the following criteria are met, the potential subject will 
not be considered eligible  for participation. This study will 
exclude subjects  who: 
1. Have a current self -reported pregnancy or are actively 
planning to become pregnant within the next [ADDRESS_294305] responsibility that, in the 
Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], may interfere with a subject’s 
(and/or care partner’s) ability to give informed consent, 
adhere to the protocol, interfere with assessment of the 
investigational product (IP), or serve as a 
contraindication to the subject’s participation in the 
study.  
3. Have a significant psychiatric disorder or mental 
disability that could interfere with the subject’s ability     to 
provide informed consent and/or comply with study 
procedures. 
4. Are participating or planning to participate in any other 
interventional studies except DKPL -[ZIP_CODE] -001. 

DEKA R&D CORP.  DKPL -[ADDRESS_294306] one AE within  each of 
these six AE subgroups will be summarized descriptively.  
Furthermore, the proportion of subjects having AEs within each 
of these six AE subgroups will be summarized by [CONTACT_2946], PT and severity (mild, moderate or severe) for the most severe ratin g of 
each AE per subject. And, the AE rate per 100 HemoCare
™ 
Hemodialysis System treatments will be calculated.  
Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for the visit 
values and change from baseline in monthly laboratory 
assessments. Baseline observ ation data for all assessments 
unless otherwise specified are the last observational values 
brought forward from DEKA Protocol DKPL-[ZIP_CODE]-001.

6.10.3 Accessibility and Control of Study Participant Data 
In order to ship IP and service investigational devices to/at subjects’ homes,  
a subset of  sponsor personnel and 
designees will need access to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_242604]/contact [CONTACT_3031]. A study -
specific procedure will be created and implemented by [CONTACT_242607]  R&D  
to document how they will collect, control, and secure subjects’ contact 
[CONTACT_242608]. Access to the collected data will be restricted to the 
teams/team members who need the information to appropriately conduct this study. Study subjects will have the ability to notify study personnel of servic e needs to 
ensure timely installation/service of device and supply  delivery. 
 
Sponsor or designees will service devices directly in subjects’ homes, collect blood and water samples, and designated couriers will deliver specified investigational a nd non- investigational product (e.g., acid concentrate and 
HemoCare™ Bicarbonate Concentrate Set) directly into subjects’ homes. These groups will communicate through the study sites to minimize direct patient interaction where appropriate. The Sponsor wil l ultimately redact all collected confidential 
information from study documentation when subjects  end their study participation  and 
all investigational products are removed  from  the subjects’ homes  
 
 
7 STUDY ACTIVITIES  
7.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Medical  history and medications  will be reviewed  and updated as necessary.  Demographics 
(age, gender, race, and ethnicity) were recorded in DEKA Protocol DKPL -[ZIP_CODE]-001. For 
this study,  baseline observation data for all assessments  are defined in section 11.[ADDRESS_294307]  is discontinuing from  the study 
because of an  AE.

DEKA R&D CORP.  DKPL -[ADDRESS_294308] is dialyzed with HemoCare™ Hemodialysis System, the following 
information will be obtained from HemoCare™ Connectivity Platform and Treatment 
Flowsheet : 
 
• Medications given during or immediately after  treatment 
• Anticoagulation regimen  
• Treatment  interventions 
• Patient weight: pre - and post -dialysis  (if unable to enter post-dialysis weight in device, subject 
will note the weight on the Treatment Flowsheet)  
• Blood pressure: both pre and post- dialysis seated  
• Pulse: both pre-dialysis and post- dialysis  seated  
• Body temperature: pre- and post- dialysis  
 
A study nurse or their designee will collect study data monthly (minimum) as detailed in 
the section below. The Investigator or designee will assess each subject on a weekly basis according  to care plan (see Section 7 .8). The assessment  may include blood pressure,  fluid 
status, and dialysis prescription.

 System shall not exceed microbial or endotoxin levels as stated in ANSI/AAMI /ISO  
[ZIP_CODE]-5:[ADDRESS_294309],  the acceptable limit for 
microorganisms  is < 0.1 CFU/mL and the acceptable limit for endotoxin is < 0.03 
EU/mL.  
 
7.9.3 Process for Res ponding to Out -of-Specification  Results  
[IP_ADDRESS] Decision  Tree  
Clinical study decision trees for ultrapure samples have been developed and will be 
provided to study sites. These decision trees provide guidance to the clinical site 
and the DEKA R&D  team on appropriate actions to be taken 
in situations where OOS results are received from ultrapure  
 
Upon confirmation of an OOS value for either endotoxin or bacteria, the user will be directed to replace if applicable.     
 
 
Additional actions are described as follows: 
• Resample.  
• All device logs evaluated for  anomalies.  
• Procedure checklists recorded during sample collection and processing 
reviewed for  anomalies.  
• Contract Laboratory will conduct an independent investigation of their 
procedures and processes for any OOS endotoxin or micro-organism result.  
• Consideration for additional actions such as retrieval and analysis of 
hardware and/or disposables, on site investigation for additional machine 
and environmental cultures, etc.

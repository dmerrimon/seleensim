1 I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
A. Introduction  
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental health problem in Veteran and non-
Veteran populations.  PTSD can develop following exposure to a traumatic event such as 
combat, assault, disaster, and accidents  (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).   Lifetime 
prevalence in US adults is higher in women ( 11.7%) than in men ( 4.0%) (Kessler et al., 2012)  
and is especially high among military Veterans (Kulka et al., 1990; Ramchand et al., 2010).  
According to a report by [CONTACT_284140] (Tanelian & Jaycox, 2008), the prevalence of PTSD is 14% in military personnel who served in Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, or New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND).   
The symptoms of PTSD include re- experiencing the traumatic event, avoidance of stimuli 
associated with the event or numbing of general responsiveness, and increased arousal, with the increased arousal manifested by [CONTACT_284141], irritability or anger outbursts, and an exaggerated startle response.  However, PTSD has much broader effects on 
the lives of individuals who develop it.  PTSD is associated with a range of comorbid conditions 
and functional difficulties, including depression, substance abuse, anxiety disorders,  
psychosocial impairment, poor physical health, and greater service utilization (e.g., Kessler et 
al., 2005; Kulka et al., 1990; Schnurr et al., 2009) .  Without adequate treatment, PTSD can 
become chronic ( Kessler  et al., 1995), lasting even into old age (Kessler et al., 2012; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_284028]., 2011; Schnurr et al., 2002).  Unfortunat ely, individuals with PTSD are less likely than those 
with other common psychiatric disorders to seek treatment.  The National Comorbidity Survey Replication (Wang et al., 2005) estimated that the cumulative lifetime probability of treatment contact [CONTACT_284142] 65.3% for PTSD, versus 88.1% for major depression and 95.3% for panic 
disorder.  Time to initial contact [CONTACT_284143].  
B. Treatment of PTSD  
1. Treatment effectiveness  
Practice guidelines for PTSD recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Eye Movement 
Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) , and 
the serotonin norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] (SNRI) venlafaxine as prim ary treatments 
(American Psychiatric Association Work Group on ASD and PTSD, 2004; Departments of 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
2 Veterans Affairs and Defense, 2010; Foa et al., 2008).  CBT is a type of psychotherapy that 
uses  systematic techniques based on learning theory and cognitive psychology to help patients 
identify and correct  dysfunctional thoughts, behaviors, and emotions.   Two of the most well -
studied types of CBT  for treating PTSD are being disseminated nationally across VA (Karlin et 
al., 2010 ): a type of exposure therapy known as Prolonged Exposure (PE; Foa et al., 2007)  and 
a type of cognitive therapy known as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT ; Resick  et al., 2010 )..   
The evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of PE and CPT is particularly strong.  A report by 
[CONTACT_120845] (IOM; 2008) found that only CBT with an exposure component had 
sufficient evidence of effectiveness.  However, b oth PE and CPT were classified in that report 
as exposure therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], although CPT is predominantly a cognitive therapy.  A more recent 
report by [CONTACT_229334] (AHRQ; 2012) that categorized PE 
and CPT separately found that evidence of effectiveness for exposure therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including PE) 
was strong for reducing PTSD and depression  symptoms and moderate for achieving loss of  
PTSD  diagnosis.  The AHRQ report found the evidence was moderate for cognitive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(like CPT) and for mixed types of CBT.  No other types of psychotherapy were judged to have 
moderate or better evidence for all three outcomes.  
In contrast, the IOM (2008) found that the evidence for the effectiveness of medication was 
inconclusive, mostly due to the potential for bias introduced by [CONTACT_284144] -observation- carried-forward method of handling missing data.   The AHRQ 
report found moderate evidence of effectiveness for the SSRI paroxetine and the SNRI  
venlafaxine for treating PTSD severity, depression severity, and loss of PTSD diagnosis.  
2. The need for comparative effectiveness research on treatments for PTSD  
A report by [CONTACT_284145] 2009 set out a national agenda for comparative effectiveness research 
(CER), in response to a Congressional allocation of over $[ADDRESS_346929] adequate power to compare active 
treatments.  Consequently, the recent AHRQ report (2012) on PTSD treatment calls for studies 
that compare psychological treatments with the best evidence of efficacy , following  a similar 
recommendation by [CONTACT_26077] (Institute of Medicine, 2008).  The IOM report specifically mentioned the need for more research on the treatment of PTSD in military Veterans.  
Comparing PE to CPT would directly respond to these recommendations.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
3 Table I.1 presents information from the AHRQ report (2012) on between- group differences in 
reduction of PTSD symptom severity for all psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_284029].  The data are presented as the difference in pre- post change between active treatment and control on the Clinician-
Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Weathers et al., 2001), the gold standard for PTSD 
assessment.   
Table I.1.  AHRQ findings for Treatments with Moderate or High  Evidence Across Outcomes  
Treatment  Strength of Evidence  Pre-post Difference in PTSD Severity  
vs. Controls  (95% CI ) 
CBT–Cognitive  Processing Therapya Moderate  -35.9 ( -52.8 to -19.0)  
CBT–Exposureb High -24.4 ( -37.2 to -11.5)  
CBT–Mixed  Moderate  -27.6 (-40.0 to -15.3)  
Venlafaxine  Moderate  -7.2 (-11.0 to -3.3) 
Paroxetine  Moderate  -12.6 ( -15.7 to -9.5) 
Note .  PTSD severity was measured on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (Weathers et al., 2001).   A difference 
of 10 points is considered to be the minimum indicating treatment response (Schnurr et al., 2001).  aAll 3 studies in 
the CBT -Cognitive Restructuring category for this outcome were Cognitive Processing Therapy (Chard et al., 2005; 
Monson et al., 2006; Resick et al., 2002).  bFour of the 5 studies in the CBT-Exposure category for this outcome were 
Prolonged Exposure (Asukai et al., 2010; Resick et al., 2002; Rothbaum et al., 2005; Schnurr et al., 2007).  
These data illustrate a consistent finding across other reviews: that psychotherapy is more 
effective than medication.  It is difficult to directly compare the effectiveness of psychotherapy and medication because of differences in study design, particularly the type of control group.  Whereas placebos are used in medication trials, psychotherapy studies use less active controls (waitlist) and more active controls (nonspecific treatment, treatment -as-usual) (Schnurr, 2007).  
However, it is unlikely that methodological factors completely account for the difference between the psychotherapy and medication findings.  
3. Patient preferences  
Studies of patient preferences have found that patients prefer psychotherapy over medication for the treatment of PTSD. In a study that used equipoise- stratified randomization, Shalev et al. 
(2012) found that 43% declined to be randomized to medication, whereas only 3.3% declined 
cognitive therapy (63% of whom also declined medi cation) and 1.2% declined PE (67% of 
whom also declined medication).  A recent randomized clinical trial of sertraline versus PE 
(Feeney et al., 2010) found that 61% of study partici pants preferred PE.  In addition, 
discrepancy between a patient’s preference and assigned group predicted lower response to both treatments.   An ongoing study in the Netherlands found that only 4% of participants wanted 
medication, preferring PE (50%) or EMDR (46%) instead (van Minnen, 2012).  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346930] evidence about their effectiveness relative to one another.  The only study to 
compare the treatments was a single- site trial in civilian female rape survivors (Resick et al., 
2002).  Both PE and CPT were highly effective but the effect size of the difference between 
them was neither clinically nor statistically significant ( d = 0.14 favoring CPT).  Follow -up of the 
sample an average of [ADDRESS_346931] size < .01 (Resick et al., 2012).  However, with [ADDRESS_346932] smaller than medium ( d = .50; Cohen, 1988) , which is unlikely for two highly effective treatments .  Thus, the 
lack of difference between treatments is inconclusive.  
Other finding s suggesting that CPT is more effective than PE are similarly inconclusive.  A 
meta -analysis currently under review (Watts et al., 2012) found that the standardized mean 
difference (vs. control) was nonsignificantly larger for CPT ( d = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.27, 2.11) than 
for PE ( d = 1.38, 95% CI = 0. 90, 1. 86).  According to the AHRQ report (2012; Table I.1), which 
was based on fewer studies because the authors eliminated studies judged to have a high risk of bias, the decrease in PTSD severity scores on the CAPS between intervention and control was larger in CPT than in PE: -35.9 (-52.81, -18.97) in CPT versus  -24.4 (-37.2, -11.5)  in PE .  
However, confidence intervals for PE and CPT were overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_284030].  Also, the 
estimate for exposure in the AHRQ report did not include data from two trials that had found a 
substantial effect of exposure versus waitlist because these trials did not use the CAPS (Foa et al., 1999, 2005).  In addition, the difference may be explained by [CONTACT_284146], which results in larger effects.  
In contrast, some of the PE studies used a treated control group ; CSP #494 (Schnurr et al., 
2007), which introduced significant heterogeneity in the AHRQ analysis, had a distinctively 
active comparison group.   
Evaluation data from VA’s rollouts (Table I.2) showing a larger effect size for CPT than for PE 
are difficult to interpret as well because key decisions about factors that could affect outcome 
(such as  the criterion for determining treatment completion) are not standardized across 
treatments .  Never theless, these data demonstrate that both treatments are effective in VA 
patients.

Cognitive Processing Therapy  689 64.8 (10.6)  44.5 (14.2)  20.[ADDRESS_346934] ( PCL, Weathers et al., 1993).  Using a CAPS difference 
of 10 points as a benchmark (Schnurr et al., 2001), a difference of 8 points would be considered to be the minimum 
indicating treatment response based on a regression of the PCL on CAPS scores (Monson et al., 2008) . 
In summary, the data comparing PE and CPT  are inconclusive.  There has been only one direct 
comparison.  It was not sufficiently powered and the study population was exclusively female 
non-Veteran rape survivors.  Findings from recent quantitative reviews suggest that CPT has a 
somewhat larger effect on PTSD severity scores , but methodological factors may explain the 
difference.   Methodological factors also may account for the larger effect size observed for CPT 
than for PE in the VA rollouts .  CSP #[ADDRESS_346935] between the treatments.  
2. Provider beliefs about PE and CPT 
Data from an ongoing study by [CONTACT_284147] (including Co-Proponents  Schnurr and Ruzek) suggest 
that VA clinicians prefer CPT over PE and believe it to be more effective than PE , even though 
there is no evidence to substantiate this belief.  In the study, 201 providers from 38 VA residential PTSD treatment programs participated in a web- based survey about implementation 
of PE and  CPT (Cook et al., 2012).
  Questions were derived from Greenhalgh et al.’s (2005) 
model of implementation that was based on Roger’s (2003) classic model .

CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
6 The data reported in Table I.3 show that CPT was rated more positively than PE on a range of 
innovation characteristics, including relative advantage,  compatibility,  trialability , potential for 
reinvention,  task issues,  and augmentation- technical support , and lower than PE on perceived 
risk). Consistent with the pattern noted for innovation characteristics, participants reported 
significantly higher skill with CPT than with PE, and both more dedicated time and resources  
and incentives and mandates for CPT than for PE. 
Other findings suggest that some clinicians incorrectly  believe that exposure therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284031] f or patients to tolerate and that these treatments can lead to symptom worsening 
and increased dropout, despi[INVESTIGATOR_284032]  (Feeny et al., 2003; van Minnen et al., 
2010) .  For example, van Minnen (2012) found that 82% of participants rated PE as an 
acceptable treatment  and 50% preferred it over EMDR or medication.  Also, t here is  no 
difference in dropout across studies of exposure therapy, cognitive therapy, other types of CBT, 
and EMDR (Hembree et al., 2003 ).  Reliable data comparing PE and CPT could help to 
conclusively address unfounded beliefs and biases and encourage therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284033] a neutral manner that supports patient choice.  
3. Patient preferences  
There are no published data on patients ’ preferences for PE versus CPT.  Results of a recent 
randomized clinical trial of a PTSD decision aid that are currently being prepared for publication, 
34% of the participants  wanted CPT after viewing the decision aid, versus 3.8% who wanted PE 
and 17.7% who wanted medication; 43.9% had no preference and 1.5% preferred EMDR (Watts 
& Schnurr, 2012).   The low percentage of participants  who wanted PE is surprising in light of 
van Minnen’s  (2012) finding that 50% of participants  preferred PE.   However, the difference 
could be explained by [CONTACT_284148]’s study .  Regardless of the reason, providing patients with reliable 
information about the comparative effectiveness could help them make informed choices about 
their care.   
4. Scientific and practical issues  
Given the limited evidence about the comparative effectiveness of treatments for PTSD, the proposed study would generate information that would be relevant not only to VA but also to 
DoD and the broader scientific community.  Although there is no specific reason to indicate that Resick et al.’s (2002) results would not generalize to men and to other types of trauma 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
7 survivors, the applicability of the findings beyond female civilian rape survivors would be 
strengthened by a comparison in a more heterogeneous sample.  
A comparison of PE to CPT has significant scientific relevance because each treatment reflects 
a different theoretical model of the etiology of PTSD.  Prolonged Exposure is based on the 
Emotional Processing Theory of anxiety disorders and their treatment (Foa & Kozak, 1986) and 
its extension to explain the natural recovery after a traumatic experience, the maintenance of 
chronic PTSD, and treatment of the disorder (Foa & Cahill, 2001).  Emotional Processing 
Theory proposes that PTSD can be conceptualized as a specific emotional structure that is 
characterized by [CONTACT_284149]: the world is entirely dangerous and the PTSD sufferer is entirely incompetent.  These perceptions are common in the immediate 
aftermath of a traumatic event, but are maintained by [CONTACT_284150], which prevent s processing of the event, and avoiding situations and objects that are 
distressing, which maintains the perception about the world as entirely dangerous and the self 
as entirely incompetent.  According to the theory, to reduce PTSD symptoms, trauma memory 
must be activated and information that is incompatible with the basic erroneous perception must be incorporated in the trauma memory.  This is accomplished by [CONTACT_284151] (to enhance organization of the traumatic memory  and correct misconception about it) as well as in vivo 
exposure to distressing (but actually safe) stimuli which disconfirm that misconception that the world is entirely dangerous. Both kinds of exposure help disconfirm the perception of oneself as 
incom petent and unable to cope with stress.  
According to the model of Cognitive Processing Therapy (Resick et al., 2002), PTSD develops because trauma survivors distort their beliefs about themselves and the world in an attempt to 
protect themselves from future trauma.  They also tend to blame themselves or non- perpetrating 
others in order to maintain a belief in a just world (“I must have done something wrong, for this 
outcome to have occurred”). Treatment begins by [CONTACT_284152] -blame and then shifts to distorted beliefs about oneself and the world (“No one can be 
trusted”).  During treatment, patients are taught through Socratic questioning and daily worksheets to challenge their beliefs and assumptions.  As beliefs become less distorted, patients generate more balanced self -statements for practice and PTSD symptoms lessen.  
Patients also write detailed accounts of the most traumatic incident(s) that they read to themselves and to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284034].   
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346936], an 
important advantage of PE is that it can be used to treat other anxiety disorders such as simple and social phobia, panic disorder, and obsessive- compulsive disorder.  Thus, PE offers a 
versatile approach that can be used to treat a wide range of patients.  
In addition to knowing how PE and CPT compare overall, there is a similar need for information 
about the relative benefits for subgroups of patients.  The study that compared PE and CPT  
(Resick et al., 2002) offers little guidance.  The homogeneity of the sample in terms of gender 
and trauma type prevented the investigators from looking at the potential differences related to 
these variables.   Subsequent analyses from this study (Rizvi et al., 2009 ) examined age, 
education, intelligence, depression, anger, and general (non -trauma) guilt as predictors of 
treatment outcome in PE and CPT.  The investigators  found evidence of differential symptom 
response to treatment for age only.  Among younger women,  those who received CPT had 
greater improvements in PTSD than those who received PE, whereas among older women, 
those who received PE had greater improvements. The investigators also looked at dropout, another important outcome, and found that higher baseline anger was related to dropout from PE, but not from CPT.    
There is not enough evidence about predictors of differential treatment response in PTSD to 
justify powering a study to perform subgroup analysis, e.g., to examine whether men and women differ in response to PE and CPT.  However, a study conducted in a large 
heterogeneous sample of male and female Veterans would permit exploratory analyses of predictors of response to PE and CPT.  The information obtained would guide future research about what works for whom, a key goal of comparative effectiveness research and a necessary ingredient in delivering optimal, Veteran -centered care.  
D. Importance of the Proposed Research to VA  
Of the almost 5.4 million Veterans who used VA care in FY 2011, 8.9% had a diagnosis of PTSD, including 8.7% of men and 11.6% of women.  Prevalence is even higher in returning 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
9 Veterans who use VA care: almost 1 in 4 OEF/OIF/OND Veterans seeking VA care has PTSD 
(VA Northeast Program Evaluation Center, 2012).  Prevalence is also high in Veterans of other 
cohorts (Fontana & Rosenheck, 2008), including those who have experienced military sexual 
trauma ( Kimerling et al., 2008) and mild traumatic brain injury (Hoge et al., 2008).  Furthermore, 
the costs associated with disability compensation for PTSD have increased substantially since 
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In FY 2011, PTSD was the 3rd most prevalent service-
connected disability, with 501,280  Veterans receiving some level of disability compensation for 
PTSD (Veterans Benef its Admin istration, 2012). 
VA has a vested interest in understanding the relative effectiveness of PE and CPT (see 
Section XVII for a letter of support from [CONTACT_284258], Chief Consultant for Mental Health 
Services) .  Both treatments are recommended at the highest level in the VA/ DoD PTSD Practice 
Guideline (Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, 2010).  According to the Uniform 
Mental Health Services Handbook, VA is required to make these treatments available to Veterans seeking PTSD care.  PE and CPT are being disseminated nationally across the VA 
system in order to enhance the availability of evidence- based treatments to Veterans with PTSD 
(Karlin et al., 2010).  In FY 2011, VA instituted a new quality measure to enhance the likelihood that patients with PTSD will receive an evidence- based therapy like PE or CPT: specifically, the 
percentage of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans who engage in a new epi[INVESTIGATOR_284035] [ADDRESS_346937] 
limited information on which to base their choice between the treatments, if both are available. 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284036] s.  As described in Section I.C.2 , these beliefs can be strong and 
erroneous .  We confronted this problem directly when conducting CSP #494, which evaluated 
the effectiveness of PE for female Veterans and Soldiers (Schnurr et al., 2007) .  In the process 
of recruiting therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284037] #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
10 complicated and fragile to do exposure therapy.   Findings from CSP #494 indicated that PE was 
not only effective, but also safe and feasible.  Yet findings from the ongoing study of the 
implementation of PE and CPT in VA residential programs described above show that VA 
providers hold more favorable beliefs about CPT (Cook et al., 2012).  Although there is 
equipoise with respect to the potential effectiveness of the treatments, it is likely that patient 
choices are not sufficiently informed by [CONTACT_12243].  
E. Feasibility of a Cooperative Study within the VA  
A multi- site study is required to attain the statistical power needed for a study that aims to 
compare two effective treatments and to examine factors that relate to  differential treatment 
response.  Power is a key consideration.  It would not be possible to obtain sufficient power with 
data from a single site, or even from a few sites.  In addition, the multiple sites enhance generalizability of findings and will help us obtain a more realistic effect size than we might from using just a few sites.   
VA is uniquely positioned to conduct a study that would be extremely difficult at best to do in the 
civilian sector.  The VA Cooperative Studies Program is able to efficiently support the number of 
sites needed.  In addition, the national rollouts of PE and CPT  have enhanced the ability to do 
large -scale psychotherapy research on these treatments.  As of August 2012, approximately 
4,[ADDRESS_346938] 4 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284038] 4 who are proficient in CPT (i.e., 
they have been trained and undergone case consultation) .  
At present [ADDRESS_346939] from 36 sites to date (see Volume 2 of the study protocol  for 
letters).  There is a high degree of enthusiasm at these sites for taking part in the trial.  The 
locations , and the number of unique outpatients treated for PTSD at these locations in FY 2011, 
are listed in Table I.4.  Thirteen of these sites are part of VA’s Women’s Health Practice- Based 
Research Network  (PBRN) , which has agreed to work with us t o ensure enrollment of adequate 
numbers of women in the trial (see Section XVII for a letter of support from [CONTACT_20278]).   
Five sites are newly approved CSP NODES sites, and [ADDRESS_346940] a high number of enrolled OEF/OIF/OND Veterans to ensure adequate representation of this cohort.

*Site in the Women’s Health Practice -Based Research Network ;  †Site in NODES program.  
If we assume that only 5% of patients are enrolled, we find that a site with at least 1280 unique 
patients should be able to recruit 64 patients over a 2.5- year period.  All of the potential sites 
except 1 (Coatesville, PA, which would have to enroll 5.2% ) have a number of patients that 
would exceed this threshold.   The remaining sites would have to enroll less than 1% to 3.9%.    
Furthermore, our inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to yield a maximally generalizable sample of patients for comparative effectiveness, replicating insofar as possible the actual patients with whom these treatments could be used ( Section IV.A ).  The aim of the 
criteria is to promote participants’ safety and their ability to engage in treatment.  Inclusion 
requires that  a person have PTSD and have telephone access  or be able to come to VA for 
phone interview.  A participant also must agree to study conditions: recording of assessments 
and treatment sessions and not receiving other treatment for PTSD (except medication and self -
help groups) while receiving study treatment.  In CSP #494, of 353 potential participants who met with staff to learn about the study, only 5 refused to agree to study conditions, none refused consent, and 28 simply did not continue, for a total of 9%.  Exclusion criteria are nonrestrictive 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346943] are conditions that could change and allow future eligibility: significant cognitive 
impairment, suicidality, homicidality , and current (but not past) substance dependence, 
psychotic symptoms, and mania ( including manic phase of bipolar disorder ).  In FY 2011, 11.8% 
of VA patients with PTSD had alcohol dependence (D. Kivlahan, personal communication, October 17, 2012), less than 1% of OEF/OIF/OND VA users diagnosed with PTSD also 
sustained severe TBI (N. Sayer, personal communication, October 17, 2012), and only 1.20% 
(7,361 of 611,357) of Veterans with a PTSD diagnosis had a reported FY11 non- fatal suicide 
attempt (J. Kemp, personal communication, October 17, 2012).  Although we have been unable to find a data source that would permit us to apply our criteria to derive precise estimates of the number of eligible patients per site and the above data do not reflect all of our criteria, the prevalence of exclusionary rule- outs is not likely to impair feasibility of recruiting a sufficient 
number of eligible patients.  
In reality , the number of potentially eligible Veterans is likely to be larger than indicated i n Table 
I.4.  The number of patients who received treatment for PTSD in the VA increased by 356,781 
(249.4 %) between 1997 and 2010, not only because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but 
also due to increased number of Vietnam Veterans seeking PTSD care (Hermes et al., 2012).  
Since 2005, growth has increased at an annual rate of 14.8%, compared with 12.6% between 1997 and 2005.   In FY11, 476,515 men and 38,002 women who received specialized mental 
health treatment in VA were seen for a diagnosis of PTSD (VA Northeast Program Evaluation Center, 2012).  Approximately 93% used outpatient mental healthcare.  The number of mental health visits by [CONTACT_284153] 1.6% annually from 1997 to 2005, and then jumped 
19.6% annually from 2005 to 2010, when the average number of visits was 14.8 (Hermes et al., 2012).  Thus, t he growing prevalence of PTSD in users of VA healthcare supports  the feasibility 
of the trial as well.   
The feasibility of the trial is further enhanced by [CONTACT_284154] a patient on the study protocol could help a facility meet the new PTSD quality measure of delivering [ADDRESS_346944] completed the required VA training in PE or CPT and received the case consultation 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346945] demonstrated the effectiveness and acceptability of PE and CPT in 
male and female Veterans (Monson et al., 2006; Nacasch et al., 2011; Schnurr et al., 2007).  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_284039]/OIF/OND 
Veterans ( Chard  et al., 2010; Rauch  et al. , 2009; Yoder et al., 2012 ) and feasibility of treating 
Veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) (Chard et al., 2011).  Thus, the treatments would be 
broadly applicable across a range of VA patients with PTSD.   
Our record and experience further support the feasibility of the proposed study.  The Principal 
Proponents and member s of the Planning Committee have a demonstrated record of 
successfully conducting multisite psychotherapy research studies in VA, including  2 VA 
Cooperative Studies, CSP #420 (group therapy for male Vietnam Veterans; Schnurr et al., 2003) and CSP #494 (PE for female Veterans and active duty personnel; Schnurr et al., 2007) .  
Drs. Foa and Resick are the developers of PE and CPT, respectively, and have conducted 
many of the most influential trials of PTSD treatment (e.g., Foa et al., 2005; Resick et al., 2002).   
In addition to his experience in conducting psychotherapy trials, [CONTACT_6033] brings experience 
in pharmacotherapy research and programmatic support from his leadership role in the PTSD Mentoring Program .  
Members of the Planning Committee also designed the VA’s national rollouts of the treatments 
we propose to compare .  Co-Chairs Chard and Ruzek direct these rollouts  and [CONTACT_284259]  is 
the manager for the PE rollout .  [CONTACT_284260] is a PE expert and a trainer for the PE rollout.  
Furthermore, we have significant support from the Mental Health Services program office: [CONTACT_284261], Deputy Chief Consultant for Specialty Mental Health, and [CONTACT_284262], 
National Mental Health Director fo r Psychotherapy and Psychogeriatrics (who leads VA’s 
Evidence- Based Psychotherapy program) , have served as part of the Planning Committee  and 
are committed to facilitating the success of the trial  (see the letter of support in Section XVII).

F. Summary  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_284040] -
Veterans, there is insufficient evidence about the relative effectiveness of these treatment s.   A 
comparative effectiveness trial of PE and CPT would be important from both a practical and a 
scientific standpoint, and have relevance within and outside VA:  
• First, there is a pressing need to understand how the treatments compare with one 
another in order to assist VA leadership, clinicians, and Veterans in making informed 
choices about the delivery of PTSD care in VA.  The attached letter from [CONTACT_284264], Chief Consultant in VA Mental Health Services , specifically describes how the 
study results would help to strengthen policy and practice of mental health care in VA.   A 
unique advantage for this study is that there are administrative structures led by 
[CONTACT_40221] —specifically the Evidence- Based Psychotherapy Program 
and the PTSD Mentoring Program —that exist to facilitate implementation of study 
findings.   The findings would inform clinical practice outside VA as well.  
• Second, there is a compelling scientific reason to compare the treatments.  They are 
based on differing theories about the development of PTSD.  A demonstration that one treatment is superior to the other would further scientific exploration by [CONTACT_284155].  Better evidence about etiology and 
underlying mechanisms would then have the potential for advancements in the prevention and treatment of PTSD.  The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 
(2012) has r ecommended comparative effectiveness trials of effective PTSD treatment s 
and the Institu te of Medicine (2008) specifically noted the need for research on 
Veterans.  
• And third, the available evidence is suggestive but not conclusive.  With only one head-to-head comparison that was conducted in a relatively small and select sample of non-
Veteran trauma survivors, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of PE and CPT .  A large multi -site trial with men and women 
would substantially strengthen the inferences that could be drawn from the study and the study’s impact on the field.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
15 When designing the study , we considered the option of proposing an equivalence design given 
the limited evidence suggesting that the treatments differ.  We also considered proposing a 
traditional superiority design, hypothesizing that CPT is superior to PE given the 2012 AHRQ 
report and the rollout data favoring CPT.  However, because methodological factors may 
account for the apparent difference between PE and CPT , we decided to propose a traditional 
superiority design with a nondirectional  hypothesis.  We believe the question it allows us to 
ask—is one treatment better than the other ?—is the most important  and most appropriate 
given the available evidenc e.  
By [CONTACT_284156] a study large enough to detect a small  difference ( d = .25), we are willing to risk 
the possibility that the  true difference between PE and CPT  is smaller.  If so, the difference 
would have little scientific or practical value.  In contrast, finding that one treatment is superior 
would enhance understanding of both etiology and treatment  and yield information that is 
actionable.  If CPT is more effective than PE, the fact that CPT involves shorter sessions could 
encourage more effici ent use of resources.  If PE is more effective, this would provide important 
justification for both clinicians and patients about the relative benefits of a treatment that they 
might otherwise avoid because of the intense trauma focus elements.  Regardless  of which 
treatment is better, patients would have more information to help them make an informed decision about which treatment to choose and VA would have stronger evidence to help make 
care Veteran -centered. 
 
  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346946] differential response to PE and CPT .  Although data are insufficient to justify a much larger 
study to address the question of which treatment works for which patients, these exploratory analyses can generate findings to inform future hypothesis -driven research.  
Exploratory analyses also will characterize amount and quality of treatment and examine how 
treatment dose (e.g., number of sessions, total number of  hours), treatment engagement 
(homework), and treatment fidelity (therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169373]) relate to outcomes 
within and between treatments .

17 III. SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN  
The study will be a prospective randomized clinical trial with blinded assessment.  The 
population will be male and female Veterans with PTSD due to any traumatic military event.  
Patients who are eligible and agree to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to receive Prolonged Exposure or Cognitive Processing Therapy.  Prior to randomization, patients 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_307].  
The primary outcome is improvement in PTSD symptom severity as measured by [CONTACT_284157] -Administered PTSD Scale after treatment (Weathers et al., 2001).  The outcome 
measure will be determined from regular follow -up visits of the participants , which will occur 
prior to, at the middle and at the end of treatment and then 3 and 6 months later  (Table II. 1).

A. Study Population  
Participants will be male and female Veterans with PTSD due to any military event.  Inclusion 
and Exclusion Criteria are described in Section IV.A . 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346947] a standardized mean difference in improvement in PTSD symptom severity of 
d = .25, a sample size of 900 randomized participants provides 90% power to detect a 
difference between arms using the linear mixed effects model with a two- sided α = .05. A 
detailed description on sample size and power considerations is given in Section X . 
E.  Study Monitoring  
The intake rate and operational aspects of  this study will be monitored continuously by [CONTACT_284159]. Participating medical centers will continue in the study only if adequate patient intake is maintained, as defined by [CONTACT_1578] (DMC) at its first meeting prior to the start of the study.  A complete description of interim study 
monitoring is given in
 Sections E and XII.D .

19 IV. PATIENT POPULATION AND PATIENT RECRUITMENT  
A. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Participants will be male and female Veterans with PTSD due to any military event.  Selection 
criteria will follow those used in CSP #494 and other trials of PE and CPT  as well as the PE and 
CPT rollouts to ensure feasibility and participant safety.  
Inclusion criteria : Current PTSD and symptom severity of the DSM -V equivalent of 45 or 
higher on the DSM -IV Clinician - Administered PTSD Scale ( Weathers et al., 2001 ); agreement 
to not receive psychotherapy for PTSD during study treatment; to allow digital recording of 
phone interviews and therapy; and regular access to a telephone (or agreement to come to the VA for centrally conducted telephone interviews for participant s who do not have telephone 
access).  Medication for PTSD and other mental or physical conditions, psychotherapy for other problems, brief visits with an existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], substance abuse treatment, and self -help 
groups will be allowed.  Individuals who are taking psychoactive medication must be on a stable 
regimen  (no dose or medication change)  for 30 days  prior to study entry.  Monitoring for 
psychoactive medications will occur at the Phase 1 Screen and immediately prior to the Phase 2 Screen (when participants give informed consent and formally enter the study). Site personnel will document that they checked each participant’s psychoactive medication regimen at study entry  in the medical record or the patient binder. 
 
Exclusion criteria: S ubstance dependence not in remission for at least 1 month; current 
psychotic symptoms  or mania (or manic phase of  bipolar disorder ); significant current suicidal or 
homicidal ideation that includes a specific plan; or moderate to severe cognitive impairment defined as 1 SD below age -graded norms on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA ] 
(Nasreddine et al., 2005).   
Patients who are currently incarcerated are not eligible to participate in the study.  If a patient becomes incarcerated during the course of their participation in the study, the patient will be withdrawn immediately.  Patient s may be re- consented and re -enroll in the study  if they are still 
eligible to participate  upon their release.  
B. Recruitment  
Participants will be recruited from VA specialty and general mental health clinics, primary care, 
deployment health clinics, Vet Centers, and the community.  The sites will be encouraged to use 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
20 a variety of recruitment strategies: presentations by [CONTACT_60957] (LSI)  or Study 
Coordinator (SC)  to clinical personnel at the referral programs to remind them about the study; 
attendance at clinical team meetings; follow -up with individual clinicians; networking with 
Veterans groups likely to yield potential participants; advertising; and  direct contacts of Veterans 
who have not opted out after receipt of an introductory  letter .  We also have engaged the 
support of the Women’s Health Practice -Based Research Network  to enhance the enrollment of 
women in the trial (see the attached letter from [CONTACT_20278], the Network’s Director, and 
see attached “Women’s Enhanced Recruitment Process [WERP]” memo) and expect support 
from NODES directors at participating sites as well .  Under WERP, special efforts will be made 
to enhance recruitment of women at the CSP NODES sites that are co- located with PBRN sites  
and, as much as possible, at all CERV -PTSD  sites. .  In particular, CSP NODES sites that are 
co-located with PBRN  sites will have supplemental SC time that they  will invest in recruitment of 
women to this study, applying IRB- approved recruitment procedures.  Women are an extreme 
minority group among Veterans in VA and are likely to be under -represented without such active 
outreach efforts.  Achieving enhanced representation of women is important so as to allow for exploratory analyses of whether gender predicts differential response to the PTSD treatments studied here.  
At each site, potential participants will be referred to the Site Coordinator by [CONTACT_284160], Vet Center, or non- VA set tings.  Potential participants also may contact [CONTACT_284161]. 
Alternatively, after receipt of an introductory letter, potential  participants who do not opt  out may 
be contact[CONTACT_284162].  
1. Clinician referrals  
The SC or LSI  will provide clinician s at their site with information about inclusion and exclusion 
criteria to assist them in making appropriate referrals.  To make a referral, a  clinician will need 
sufficient information about the potential participant  to answer the Phase I screening questions 
about probable PTSD DSM -[ADDRESS_346948] about it through 
advertising.  Clinicians at the sites will be provided with brief information sheets about  the study 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346949] the Phase 1 screening with the clinician.    
At times, i nformal “offline” discussions between the SC/ LSI and a referring clinician to determine 
eligibility of potential study participants  may help facilitate the referral process.   For example, a 
clinician might first call the SC/LSI to discuss whether approaching a particular Veteran would 
be appropriate for the study if the Veteran  had PTSD due to military trauma experienced outside 
a warzone (yes). These discussions may be more frequent at the beginning of the study than at 
the end, by [CONTACT_284163] a better sense of patients who are 
appropriate  for referral .  
2. Self-referrals  
Potential participants who contact [CONTACT_284164], i.e., purpose of the study, the two treatment conditions, use of random assignment, time commitment required for both treatment and assessment, and schedule of payments they would receive for participation.  
Potential participants who are currently in treatment will be asked to discuss their participation 
with their current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], and if this therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284042] a staff member at the site, the potential participant will be referred to the clinical program at the site for an initial intake into t hat 
program.   Once the potential participant has received an intake interview, the recruitment 
process would proceed as described in the clinician referral procedures in section IV.B.[ADDRESS_346950] patients.  This will involve several steps.  
Step 1: Identify potentially eligible women Veterans  in the sampling frame .  One approach to 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_284043] (available locally) of potentially eligible women Veterans  with upcoming clinic appointments in primary care or mental 
health clinics  who are potentially eligible for the study (based upon evidence of PTSD in the 
local clinical databases, or based upon clinician input) .  Another potential approach to 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_284044] r esearch staff in the CSPCC  to pull lists of potentially 
eligible women Veterans ( women Veterans with evidence of  PTSD in VINCI  databases), 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
22 including their name, SSN, and mailing address . CSPCC research staff would then move this  
“sampling frame” for particular participating site to a site -specific f older on the secure server at 
CSPCC; each Site Coordinator can access his/her own site- specific folder on the CSPCC 
server .  
Step 2: Refine the list via chart review.   The SC may review the chart of women Veterans on the 
sampling frame list, to eliminate those who clearly do not meet study criteria.  The SC may also 
consult with a clinician who is familiar with the patient, if additional information is needed to 
supplement the chart review.  
Step 3: Mail introductory letter.   For women Veterans who appear potentially eligible for the 
study based upon Steps [ADDRESS_346951] will be included in the mailing.   Opt-in 
instructions will also be included, for those who want to self -refer to the study.  
Step 4: Directly contact [CONTACT_284165].  For women Veterans  who do not opt out 
by [CONTACT_284166] [ADDRESS_346952] the Veteran  by [CONTACT_284167]  (see Telephone Script) .  
If the potential participant is interested, then (a) the SC will invite her to attend a mental health 
intake visit  to assess  potential eligibility for the study , or, (b) if , after Phase 1 referral 
conversation with the patient’s clinician, the SC has already determined that she is appropriate for referral to the study, then the SC will invite her directly to a Phase 2 visit  (see IV.C.1).  
4. SC-initiated direct contacts to all women patients at a facility  
The prior section describes the process of sending a letter to women Veterans  who appear to 
have PTSD based upon chart review.  An additional recruitment option that sites may use as 
needed is to apply the above procedures (opt -out letter followed by a phone call) to all women 
Veteran patients at the facility, as a mechanism for identifying women with PTSD symptoms whose PTSD is not  identified by [CONTACT_284168].  A letter will be 
sent (in batches) to all women at the facility.  Women with evidence of PTSD (as described in 
the prior section) who do not opt out will be called by [CONTACT_284169].  Women without evidence of PTSD in VINCI/on chart review will be contact[CONTACT_284170] -in; this has the advantage of being an approach that will allow for identification 
of some women with PTSD symptoms not currently being addressed in VA.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
23 5. Women’s Enhanced Recruitment Process (WERP)   
To ensure women are well represented in the study sample, the recruitment processes 
described above will take into consideration approaches that maximize recruitment of women.  For example, Women’s Health providers  may be among the clinicians approached about this 
study (with the support of the Women’s Health Practice- Based Research Network [PBRN] Site 
Lead, at those locations that are part of the PBRN); presentations may be given to groups of 
women Veterans, among other networking venues; advertisements may  be posted in areas 
frequented by [CONTACT_284171], among other locations; and women Veterans may be directly 
called by [CONTACT_284172], as described abov e. 
6. Efforts to support recruitment  
The National Study Coordinator  at the Chair ’s office will contact [CONTACT_284173].  The National Study Coordinator  also will 
conduct monthly conference calls with all Site Coordinators in order to discuss issues related to all aspects of study management.  Our experience in CSP #420 and CSP #[ADDRESS_346953] helped to identify  and resolve problems and to 
share lessons learned across sites.  In addition, the Chair ’s office also will place a notice about 
the study on the National Center for PTSD website and will explore other centralized 
mechanisms of generating referrals.  
C. Screening and Consent  
The diagnostic assessments done at study entry will provide final determination of a participant’s eligibility for the study by [CONTACT_284174].  We propose to use screening and consent processes the study team has employed 
successfully in CSP #420 and CSP #494.  All participants , including self -referrals,  will enter the 
study through referral by a mental health clinician or other qualified clinician at the participating 
site.  Participants who are not currently receiving treatment at the site will first undergo an intake at the site’s mental health program so that a clinician there can refer them.   This strategy helps 
provide continuity of care for potential participants who do not enter the study, or who terminate from treatment early or need additional treatment during the study.  
Screening information will be obtained in three phases, structured so as to minimize both participant burden and cost to the study due to extensive assessment of ineligible participants.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346954] phase of screening, the Site Coordinator will consult the referring clinician  in order to 
establish a provisional PTSD diagnosis and other inclusion and exclusion criteria.  In CSP #420 
and CSP #494 this strategy resulted in a highly efficient screening process .  For example, in 
CSP #494, 43 of the 396 patients who were discussed with a referral source were ruled out at 
this phase.  Of the 353 patients who met with study staff, 320 were screened and 284 were 
randomized—71.7% of those discussed and 88.8% of those screened.  
The referral clinician  also would be asked to agree at this time to not treat the participant for 
PTSD while the participant is receiving study treatment, and would be reminded that treatment 
for other problems and brief check -ins are possible.  The Site Coordinator will then schedule 
potential participants who are eligible based on the information provided by [CONTACT_284175] [ADDRESS_346955] the potential participants initially by [CONTACT_648] (up to 5 
times) and then by [CONTACT_284176] a letter . 
2. Phase 2  
During the second phase of screening, the Site Coordinator will review the Informed Consent form with a potential participant to  explain the study in more detail.  Participants will be fully 
informed of the nature and extent of study participation, the objectives of the study, and the two 
treatments to which they will be randomly assigned.  In order to enhance participants’ 
underst anding of the treatments, the Site Coordinator will also read a brief standardized 
description of each treatment and will provide a written description of each treatment for 
participants to take home.  Participants will be informed of the fee payment structure that they will receive for completing assessments they undergo as part of the project.  Site Coordinators will be trained to make sure that all participants comprehend the nature of the study and the 
wording of the consent form and will provide a copy  of the form for participants to take home.   
After obtaining consent, the Site Coordinator will administer demographic questions, the 
VA TBI  and MST  screens, suicide and homicide screening, and the MoCA ( Nasreddine  et al., 
2005).  If responses
 on the suicide or homicide screen indicate significant risk, the 
Veteran is not eligible for the study , and the Site Coordinator will contact a project -affiliated 
mental health clinician who will conduct suicide risk assessment guided by [CONTACT_20248]’s Suicide Risk  
Assessment Guide Reference Manual and VA Assessment Pocket Card (2007).  If on the basis 
of the risk assessment the Veteran is found to be at risk for suicide or homicide and in need of 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346956] procedures described in the 
VA manual, “Safety Plan Treatment Manual to Reduce Suicide Risk: Veteran Version” (Stanley 
& Brown, 2008).  Safety plans for homicidal patients will be developed following local and 
national directives.  All plans  may include support from the VA, family contacts and friends, and 
other people the patient trusts.  Safety plan s will also incorporate the VA Veterans Crisis Line 
phone num ber: 1 -800-273-TALK (8255) as a support outlet.   
In addition, the Site Coordinator will contact [CONTACT_284177].  Any safety plan that has been created by [CONTACT_284178] t-affiliated clinician will be communicated to the referring VA clinician.   
The MoCA was initially designed to detect mild cognitive impairment.  However, new findings 
based on a larger, more diverse normative sample have shown that (a) the initially recommended cutpoint of 26 is too sensitive, especially for the goal of excluding only cases of more extensive cognitive impairment and (b) there are meaningful differences across age groups not taken into account by [CONTACT_284179] 26 (Rossetti et al., 2012).  Based on these new findings, we propose defining impairment  as 1 SD below age- graded norms as 
follows: younger than 35 years (< 21); 35 -44 years (< 20); and 45 years or older (< 18).   
Potential participants who do not rule out based on the MoCA or suicide or homicide screens 
and who agree to continue will then complete baseline questionnaires and be scheduled for a screening interview with one of the centralized Assessors in Phase 3.  
3. Phase [ADDRESS_346957] potential participants by [CONTACT_284180] , employing procedures currently in use in CSP #[ADDRESS_346958] VALOR, a registry 
study of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans  (described in Section VIII.A.2) .   
Because the study would begin after the adoption of DSM -5 criteria (scheduled for finalization in 
January 2013 and official release in May 2013), we will use versions of the CAPS (Weathers et al., 2001) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV (SCID; Spi[INVESTIGATOR_72443]., 1995) that have 
been updated to reflect changes to the diagnostic criteria for PTSD and other disorders.  The 
phone interview also will include measures of treatment preference.  The phone interviews are 
estimated to require 2 -2.5 hours, and may be broken into two sessions, as needed.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
26 Participants meeting eligibility criteria will then be assigned to treatment.  As indicated in 
Section VI.A , the Site Coordinator will use the  system established by  [CONTACT_284181]’s treatment assignment.  The Site Coordinator will contact [CONTACT_284182]’s treatment assignment and schedule the participant’s initial therapy appointment. If more than [ADDRESS_346959] in the study . If there is stil no 
response it will be assumed that the potential participant is no longer interested in the study.  
V. TREATMENT  
A. Prolonged Exposure  
Prolonged Exposure (Foa et al., 2007) is a manualized, 90- minute, 8- 15 week treatment 
program based on emotional processing theory (Foa & Kozak, 1986; Foa & Cahill, 2001), which 
posits that anxiety disorders, including PTSD, reflect pathological fear structures in which emotional and cognitive associations among different elements do not accurately  represent 
reality and renders the individual dysfunctional and distressed.  PE is designed to correct 
erroneous connections in the targeted memory structure.  PTSD sufferers typi[INVESTIGATOR_284045]: “The world is an utterly dangerous place,” and “I am completely incompetent and unable to cope with stress.”  In this 
study, the [ADDRESS_346960] been avoided.  Repeated exposure to these stimuli disconfirms the negative, unrealistic expectations of harm and the individual experiences a 
reduction in the associated fear response. Between sessions homework of in vivo exposure consists of systematically confronting trauma -related situations that are avoided and to remain 
in the situation until distress reduces by [CONTACT_2016].   Imaginal exposure involves repeated revisiting of 
the memory in imagination and recounting aloud the traumatic event(s) in detail, while vividly imagining the event(s) and paying specific attention to emotions and thoughts that occurred at 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
27 the tim e of the event.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], as patients move through the imaginal exposure process, and 
distress reduces, they can focus on increasingly specific details of the event and integrate “new” 
information that had been overlooked due to longstanding habitual and  willful avoidance of the 
memory.  The revising and recounting of the traumatic event is  followed by [CONTACT_284183]. Processing provides an opportunity for patients to examine their beliefs 
related to the trauma memory, integrate the meaning of newly available information, and to gain 
a new perspective on the trauma, as well as  to realize that they can handle successfully 
engaging with the traumatic memory rather than avoiding thinking about it.  Similar to in vivo 
exposure, repeated and prolonged imaginal exposure provides experience that disconfirms negative erroneous cognitions (e.g., if I engage with the traumatic memory rather than avoid it I will “fall apart”) and reduces emotional distress associated with confronting the memory.  
Treatment sessions are audio- recorded and patients are asked to listen to their recounting of 
the trauma daily.   Participants  will give their consent to be audio- recorded during therapy for the 
purpose of imaginal exposure homework exercises .  As this audio -recording is not analyzed 
data, but simply part of the usual and manualized PE treatment protocol, this audio- recording 
will not be beind VA firewall.  Participants  may borrow a tape recorder from their PE provider, or 
use their own audio recording device (e.g. cell phone) if they prefer.  Psychoeducation and controlled breathing exercises play a secondary role in PE.  
Psychoeducation comprises a discussion about what maintains PTSD, common reactions to trauma, and reasons why facing fears in a safe environment is therapeutic. Controlled breathing training is designed to impede the person’s sympathetic nervous system response by [CONTACT_284184], it is a tool used early on in the treatment process to encourage self efficacy and mastery of symptoms.  
Session [ADDRESS_346961] gathers information using a standardized interview, focusing on 
the patient’s symptoms, details of the trauma, history of previous trauma, and social and occupational functioning.  Breathing retraining is introduced and the patient practices slow and uniform breathing techniques.  Homework is daily breathing exercises, auditing a recording of the session, and reviewing a “Rationale for Treatment” handout.  
Session [ADDRESS_346962] provides an explanation o f PTSD, discusses common reactions to 
trauma, discusses a rationale for the treatment, and provides a description of each treatment 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
28 component.  The use of Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS) ratings is explained.  A list of 
avoided phobic situations is compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602], and an exposure hierarchy is developed.  Homework includes practicing breathing exercises daily, listening to the recording of the session at least once, reviewing the list of avoided situations and adding items to the hierarchy if appropriate, reviewing a “Common Reactions to Trauma” handout daily, and in vivo exposure.  
Session [ADDRESS_346963] asks specific questions to clarify the patient's thoughts, feelings, and physical reactions while reliving the trauma to facilitate confrontation with fear -evoking 
cues.  The parts of the scenario that are the most anxiety -producing to the patient are identified, 
and emphasized in repeated exposure.  After each exposure the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284046], as in previous sessions.  In vivo exercises are selected from the hierarchy for homework practice.  As for previous sessions, daily homework is to use the 
recording to relive the trauma, in vivo exposures selected during session, breathing practice, and to review the session recording.  
Last Session (Termination) :  Imaginal exposure lasts [ADDRESS_346964] and patient 
review treatment progress and discuss applications of treatment principles to daily life. This discussion will address the potential for temporary increases in PTSD symptoms, and how these can be managed.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
29 B. Cognitive Processing Therapy  
Cognitive Processing Therapy  (Resick et al., 2010) consists  of cognitive therapy and a written 
trauma narrative.  Patients are taught to challenge their beliefs through Socratic questioning and 
the use of daily worksheets.  The initial focus is on beliefs such as denial and self -blame, and 
then shifts to  overgeneralized beliefs about self and the world.  Patients process their trauma 
directly by [CONTACT_565] a narrative of their traumatic event(s) that they read to themselves and to 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_284047] [ADDRESS_346965] trauma (if different from that which was the focus of the CAPS ) and the patient gives a brief description of 
the event.  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284048], explains what a stuck point is (a distorted cognition about one’s role in the trauma, or implications about oneself, the world or other people) and gives the patient handouts to read as well as a stuck point log. Finally, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284049], to write an impact statement about the patient’s beliefs about why the worst traumatic event occurred and how it has affected beliefs about self and others, particularly in the areas of safety, trust, power/control, esteem and intimacy.  
Session 2:   The patient reads the impact statement (or constructs it orally if the patient didn’t do 
it).  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284050].  The 
next assignment is introduced: the ABC sheets on which the patient records events, thoughts, 
and feelings.  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284051].  Patients are assigned to complete one worksheet each day and at least one must be on the worst traumatic event.  
Session 3:   The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284052].  Gentle corrections may be made if the patient has difficulty identifying his/her thoughts or emotions and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_284053] #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
30 into a more easily challenged format (e.g., “if only I had done X, the event would not have 
happened”). The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284054]’s beliefs.  The next assignment is for the patient to handwrite an account, at home, of the worst traumatic event.  The patient is instructed to draw a line on the paper and stop briefly if he/she becomes very emotional.  Also unlike PE, the account is written in the past 
tense and they may take more than one occasion to complete the assignment.  The patient is 
asked to read the account to him or herself every day until the next session but this typi[INVESTIGATOR_284055] a few minutes.  They are asked to continue completing ABC sheets each day about items on the stuck point log or stuck points that emerge through the written account.  
Sessions 4 and 5: The patient reads the account at  the beginning of the session.  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284056].  When the patient has reoriented to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284057], and in session and then asks about any parts of the event that may have been omitted or glossed over.  The rest of 
the session is spent doing Socratic dialogue regarding any erroneous self or other bl ame, 
determining, who if anyone had intent to do harm (and therefore is the actual cause of the 
event).  Hindsight bias, outcome based reasoning and mislabeling of guilt are all corrected through Socratic dialogue.  The Just World myth may be reexplored.  The patient is assigned to 
write the account a second time and notice any changes in emotions or beliefs.  The patient continues to complete ABC worksheets.  At session [ADDRESS_346966] introduces the 
challenging questions sheet in which the patient writes one of his/her stuck points at the top of the page and asks him/herself a series of questions about the validity of the statement.  At this 
point the therapy begins to shift to teach the patient to challenge his/her own thinking.  The patient may be assigned to continue reading the account or to write an account about another trauma.  
Session 6:   The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284058].  The problematic thinking patterns worksheet is introduced and examples are generated.  In this worksheet, the patient is asked to notice stuck points and everyday thoughts that are tendencies for them to engage in such as jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_284059], 
mindreading, emotional reasoning, or all or none thinking.   
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
31 Sessions 7- 12:  After reviewing the problematic thinking patterns, the final worksheet and first of 
five themes is introduced.  The Challenging Beliefs Worksheet compi[INVESTIGATOR_284060] a final column in which the patient generates a more balanced and fact -based statement.  The patient is asked to rate how much he or she believes this new 
statement and how much they now believe the old stuck point.  The patient is also asked to 
name [CONTACT_284255].  One theme 
is explored each week in addition to the person’s individual stuck points.  Each of the themes, 
safety, trust, power/control, esteem and intimacy can be self or other oriented.  Three other assignments are given in the last few sessions in addition to reading handouts on the themes and completing worksheets.  Patients are asked to practice giving and receiving compliments to reengage with other people and to challenge their core beliefs and are asked to do at least one pleasurable or worthwhile activity for themselves each day.  This latter assignment is to help the 
patient reestablish what they used to enjoy doing and to build self -worth.  Either of these 
assignments may trigger stuck points that can then be challenged.  Behavioral activation can 
serve as relapse prevention for depression as well.  The final assignment before session [ADDRESS_346967] to verify that the participant has signed 
the informed consent form, met all the enrollment criteria, and completed the baseline assessments, he/she can use the system  established by [CONTACT_284185].  Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receiving PE or CPT.  
Participant randomization will be based on permuted blocks within each study center.  After the participant is randomized, the Site Coordinator will obtain the treatment assignment and 
complete the case report form ( CRF) on randomization.

CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
33 VII. MEASURES  
The measurement  protocol follows closely the protocols used in CSP #420 and #494.  An 
important difference in CSP #591 is that new diagnostic criteria for PTSD and other disorders 
were  implemented between submission of the proposal and the study’s beginning.  Members of 
the study team were  active participants in the revision of the PTSD criteria for DSM -5.  [CONTACT_6036] chaired the workgroup, with Drs. Schnurr and Resick as participants.  A DSM -IV to 
DSM -5 crosswalk study found that the new criteria applied well to both Veteran and non -
Veteran samples.   
The National Center for PTSD has revised and validated two key instruments, the CAPS and the PCL, according to the new diagnostic  criteria in DSM -5.  Similarly, the PTSD Diagnostic 
Scale (PDS; Foa et al., 1997) is being revised and validated for DSM -5.  Below we describe the 
existing measures but will use the new DSM -5 measures, noting important exceptions where 
needed.  Criteria for other disorders may change as well, so we propose to use the DSM -5 
criteria f or these disorders also.  
A. Screening and Eligibility   
The Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale (Weathers et al., 2001) is a clinician- administered 
interview that measures diagnostic criteria for PTSD according to the American Psychological Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.  The CAPS has excellent reliability and validity and is the gold standard for PTSD treatment research (Weathers et al., 2001).  Each of the 17 DSM -IV symptoms is rated on a 0- 4 (low to high) scale for both frequency and intensit y.  In 
DSM -5 these two rating scales will be combined into a single severity scale, which substantially 
reduces the amount of time needed to administer the CAPS.  This will facilitate telephone administration.  
In DSM -IV, symptoms of PTSD are categorized in to 3 clusters: 5 reexperiencing symptoms (B 
Cluster), 7 avoidance and numbing symptoms (C Cluster); and 5 hyperarousal symptoms (D cluster).  In order to receive a diagnosis of PTSD (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), a person must be exposed to a traumatic event; have 1 or more B symptoms, 3 or more C symptoms, and 2 or more D symptoms; experience significant distress or impairment because of the symptoms; and have symptoms for at least 30 days.  Symptom severity is computed by [CONTACT_284187] 17 items.   
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
34 In CSP #494, diagnosis required that a participant meet DSM -IV diagnostic criteria (frequency ≥ 
1 and intensity ≥ 2 for a symptom to be counted) and have a minimum level of severity (overall 
severity ≥ 45).  In DSM -5, the avoidance and numbing symptoms have been split into separate 
clusters and additional symptoms have been added.  In CSP #[ADDRESS_346969]. Marx, who will oversee the telephone assessment procedures of 
the study, is currently conducting a validation study (in collaboration with CAPS developer [CONTACT_284265]) that will allow us to identify the score that corresponds to a score of [ADDRESS_346970] (the Life Events Checklist, or LEC) and questions about stressor exposure, which will be used to ensure that participants meet the DSM -IV 
criterion of stressor exposure that is required for diag nosis.  The trauma
 checklist also will 
provide descriptive information about participant s at study entry.  In addition, we will supplement 
the interviewer questions about Criterion A exposure to permit categorization of trauma types 
according to the categories developed by [CONTACT_284188]. (2012): life threat to self, life threat to 
others, aftermath of violence, traumatic loss, moral injury by [CONTACT_6270], and moral injury by [CONTACT_2312]. 
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV (SCID), patient version ( First et al., 2002), 
assesses Axis I psychiatric disorders.  It will be used during screening to establish exclusion 
diagnoses; the data also will be used for sample description and for exploratory analysis to examine non- PTSD psychiatric disorders as predictors of treatment outcome.  It is arguably the 
most widely used clinician- administered instrument for assessing psychiatric disorder.  That 
study estimated reliability to be good using a conservative method in which different clinicians independently interview and rate the same participant ; the overall weighted kappa was .61 for 
current diagnosis and .68 for lifetime diagnosis.  We will use the SCID for DSM -5.  As in CSP 
#420 and CSP #494, we will administer the modules for mood disorders, anxiety disorders (other than PTSD), and substance abuse, along with the psychotic screen.  
Demographic information will be collected during screening, along with information about cognitive impairment on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Nasreddine et al., 2005) .  We will 
screen for history of traumatic brain injury  and exposure to military sexual trauma using the 
standard VA screening measures for these constructs  and for suicidality using  two items drawn 
from the University of Washington Suicide Risk/Distress Assessment Protocol ( Linehan, 
Comtois, & Ward- Ciesielski, 2012) ; because there are no comparable measures of homicidality, 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
35 we will modify the two suicide items to assess homicidality as well .  The suicide screening  
questions will be administered by [CONTACT_284189] -up 
interviews.  Treatment preferences will be measured as in a recent study by [CONTACT_284190]. (2010), 
in which participants are asked for a counterbalanced forced choice among treatment options 
and then rate their confidence in their choice rating.  We also will measure expectations and 
treatment credibility for both treatments as in CSP #494 using the Expectancy of Therapeutic 
Outcome Scale (Borkovec & Nau, 1972).  
B. Primary Outcome  
Improvement in the CAPS PTSD severity score from baseline will serve as the primary outcome.  
C. Secondary Outcomes  
As in CSP #494, we will use the CAPS to compute additional measures  of clinical outcomes: 
response (defined as at least 10 -point improvement in severity), loss of diagnosis (response 
plus no longer meeting DSM symptom criteria), and remission (loss of diagnosis plus the DSM -5 
score that corresponds to a DSM -IV severity sc ore < 20).  
The PTSD Checklist (Weathers et al., 1993) is  a brief questionnaire measure of PTSD symptom 
severity that is widely used within and outside VA.  In both PE and CPT, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284061] p articipant s during the 
treatment.  The scale consists of the 17 DSM -IV symptoms rated on a 1- 5 scale of how much 
that symptom bothered the individual in the prior month.  The PCL is an efficient measure of PTSD symptoms and has high sensitivity and specificity for a CAPS PTSD diagnosis.  It has excellent psychometric properties (Bliese et al., 2008) and is sensitive to treatment -related 
change (Monson et al., 2008).  At the  beginning of t he VA rollouts, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284062] -II (BDI- II; Beck et al., 1996) in PE and CPT to monitor depression 
symptoms.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] s now administer  the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ -9; Kroenke et 
al., 2001) instead.  The PHQ -9 has been well -validated as a depression outcome measure (e.g., 
Lowe et al., 2004).   
However, because the unblinded therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284063] -[ADDRESS_346971] of collaborative care for Veterans with PTSD in which the treatment protocol required care managers to administer the PCL as 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
36 part of care management (Schnurr et al., 2013 ), we turned to the PTSD Diagnostic Scale (Foa 
et al., 1997) to measure PTSD.  The PDS consists of the [ADDRESS_346972] month.  Like the PCL, it has 
excellent psychometric proper ties (Foa et al., 1997; Griffin et al., 2004) and has been used in 
many trials of treatments for PTSD (e.g., Ehlers et al., 2005; Foa et al., 2005; Foa et al., 1999; 
Resick et al., 2008).  Thus, w e will use the DSM -5 version of the both the PDS and PCL.   
For similar reasons, w e will use the BDI- II to measure depression during blinded assessment .  It 
has excellent psychometric properties and is widely used in PTSD treatment research (e.g., Foa 
et al., 2005; Monson et al., 2012; Resick et al., 2002; Schnurr et al., 2007).  Other secondary 
outcomes include several brief questionnaires.  Anger symptoms will be assessed with the State Anger subscale of the State- Trait Anger Inventory (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2996], 1988) .  We will assess 
substance abuse using the Short Inventory of Problems -Revised (SIP -R; Kiluk et al., 2012) and 
selected items from the Brief Addition Monitor (Cacciola et al., in press )—number of heavy 
drinking day s and number of drug use days) —chosen because of evidence that measures like 
this are clinically sens itive endpoints (Falik et al., 2010).  We also will assess functioning 
(WHODAS -II; World Health Organization, 2000 ), quality of life (WHOQOL -BREF; World Health 
Organization, 1996), and satisfaction (CSQ; Attkisson & Zwick, 1982).   
We will use a combination of self -report and VA administrative data to measure service 
utilization .  VA and Non-VA utilization will be measured using a brief questionnaire adapted from 
one developed for the HSR&D- funded Barriers to Care Study (Vogt, ongoing).  We will use VA 
administrative databases to obtain information about VA -funded utilization.  We will collect 
information on individual PE and CPT sessions (based on the new session templates to be launched in FY 2013), outpatient prescriptions, other outpat ient services, and inpatient care 
within all settings (acute, rehabilitation, and long -term care).  We will use the Medical SAS 
datasets (OPC for outpatient care, PTF for inpatient care) to capture all VA inpatient and outpatient utilization.  To obtain detailed information about non- study treatment before, during, 
and after treatment, we will develop a questionnaire to measure types of psychosocial treatment  
and medication use by [CONTACT_284191] #494.  At all NODES sites, and at 
other study sites wishing to participate in collecting this information, we will additionally administer Veteran Feedback Form s (VFF s) which are adapted from an Ohio State University 
instrument  [Miser] , and intended to collect information about how participants heard about the 
study, participants’ motivations for joining the study, and participants’ feedback on study 
recruitment processes  (“VFF Baseline”, administered at Phase 2), and feedback regarding 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
37 experience with being a research participant (“VFF Follow -up”, administered at the in- person [ADDRESS_346973] -treatment Assessment) .  Feedback responses will inform efforts to optimize 
Veteran- centric recruitment in future studies.

38 VIII. STUDY PROCEDURES  
We relied heavily on our experiences in CSP #420 and CSP #[ADDRESS_346974] been made 
when necessary, e.g., to accommodate the centralized telephone assessment and the 
possibility of additional treatment sessions, and also to enhance compatibility with other trials, 
e.g., assessing the primary outcome at mid- treatment.   
We also utilized current experience in CSP #[ADDRESS_346975]. Brian Marx from the Behavioral Sciences Division of the National Center for PTSD in [LOCATION_011], who oversees the telephone assessment in CSP #566, to help us design this part of the procedure for CSP #591.  He has agreed to oversee telephone 
assessment in CSP #591.  The Behavioral Science Division is an ideal site to provide 
leadership.  The Division led the development of the CAPS and PCL, and is internationally recognized for leadership in the assessment of PTSD.  The division houses a number of 
doctoral -level staff members who are experienced in administering the CAPS and SCID in 
research protocols .  
A. Assessment  
1. Schedule 
The schedule of assessments is presented in Table VIII.1 .  The primary outcome, the CAPS, 
will be  administered via telephone before, during, and after treatment, and at 3 - and 6- month 
follow -up.  In addition, the PCL and the PHQ -9 will be administered weekly during the course of 
therapy as part of the treatment protocol.  Participants’ expectations and preference will be 
measured at the beginning of treatment and treatment satisfaction will be collected at the end of 
treatment only.  Other secondary outcomes will be collected before and after treatment and at 3- 
and 6- month follow -up, with the exception of utilization, which will be measured before and after 
treatment and at 6- month follow -up.

2. Telephone Assessment  
Independent Assessors located at the [LOCATION_011] VA Medical Center will conduct the third phase of 
screening and perform all outcome assessments by [CONTACT_756].  [LOCATION_011] will conduct and 
oversee all aspects of the clinician- administered interviews performed in the study, including 
supervision and fidelity monitoring.  [LOCATION_011] was chosen as  the site given the extensive 
experience of [CONTACT_284266] and staff there in conducting telephone interviews in CSP #[ADDRESS_346979] VALOR, a registry study o f OEF/OIF/OND Veterans.  The independent assessors 
are members of the research team and are  VA or WOC employees.  
Although we considered conducting in- person interviews, we elected to conduct telephone 
interviews for several reasons.  First, being able to complete the interviews by [CONTACT_284192].  Second, centralized assessment enhances quality control by 
[CONTACT_284193] -level variation in interview fidelity and quality.  Third, the psychometric quality and 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
40 acceptability to research participants of psychiatric phone interviews are now well -established in 
Veteran (Aziz et al., 2004; Magruder et al., 2005; Schnurr et al., 2002) and non- Veter an (e.g., 
Rohde et al., 1997; Sartor et al., 2012; Shalev et al., 2012) samples.  For example, Rohde et al. 
(1997) found that the inter -rater reliability of phone interviews was excellent (kappa = .96 for 
major depressive disorder and .87 for anxiety disor ders), exceeding the .80 benchmark for 
excellent reliability.  Magruder et al. (2005), using the CAPS with a sample of Veterans seeking VA care, found 100% agreement across interviewers.  Fourth, because we are using separate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284065] d CPT, centralized phone assessment assures that the person 
who is collecting the primary outcome (the CAPS) will not see the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284066], inadvertently breaking the blind.  In summary, the phone interviews will provide a valid method of assessing mental disorder constructs, yet be considerably more cost -effective and 
more convenient for participants than in- person interviews.  
The Assessors will introduce the telephone interview portion of the study to the participant informing the pa rticipant about the content of the interview and then reminding them that the 
interview is being recorded.  We will digitally record telephone assessments for the purposes of checking interviewer reliability, following procedures used in CSP #566.   
All co mputers used for audio recordings will be VA- issued.  Desktop computers will be 
networked within the VA system and password- protected. Laptops will be VA- issued, encrypted, 
password protected, and have VPN capabilities.  R ecorded files for CSP #[ADDRESS_346980] attempts including a final letter will be made before a participant is considered to be 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
41 unreachable at that time point.  Participants who fail to participate in a scheduled assessment 
will be contact[CONTACT_3012] (or mail, when necessary) for rescheduling.  After two missed appointments without explanation, a participant will be considered to have missed that assessment interval.   
4. Blinding  
Assessors located at the [LOCATION_011] VA Medical Center who conduct the interviews will be blind to a participant’s treatment condition.  Although the use of centralized telephone assessment can help to minimize unblinding that may occur at the sites (e.g., by [CONTACT_238389] a participant come out of a given therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s office), at each interview, the Assessor will remind the participant to not reveal the treatment condition to which the participant has been assigned.  After each follow -up 
assessment, Assessors will indicate on the CRF if they become unbl inded to a participant’s 
treatment as signment.    
Because Site Coordinators will deliver information about treatment assignment to participants, we have taken different precautions to ensure the validity of the secondary questionnaire 
assessments that will be collected by [CONTACT_48769].  The Site Coordinators will provide 
folders containing the questionnaire measures to participants and then collect these folders from 
participants after completion.  Site Coordinators also will remind participants to not discuss their treatment assignment dur ing the visit.  The Site Coordinators will remain available to answer 
participant’s questions but will not stay in the room with participants during questionnaire completion in order to minimize contact [CONTACT_284194].  However, Site Coordinators will check forms for completeness before a participant 
leaves so that any missed items can be completed.   It is preferred that the secondary 
questionnaire assessments be completed by [CONTACT_284195] -person. Howe ver, it will be 
acceptable for Site Coordinators  to send and collect  secondary questionnaire assessments  by 
[CONTACT_284196]- person visit (e.g., if the participant moved 
away after completion of treatment).  If an assessment needs to be completed by [CONTACT_2319], the Site 
Coordinator should contact [CONTACT_284197]/her that the assessment will be mailed.   If the Site Coordinator finds, upon receiving the mailed asses sments, that the 
participant  endorses moderate or severe suicidal ideation, the Site Coordinator will inform the 
Local Site Investigator or a study clinician. The clinician will follow the procedures outlined in the CSP 591 high -risk protocol, and appropriate actions may include transferring the participant to 
the Veterans Crisis Line with the VA Warm Transfer Protocol (2- 800-273-TALK, PRESS 1).

5. Reliability  
All SCID and CAPS interviews will be digitally recorded.  Approximately one hundred SCIDs and 
200 CAPS (sampled equally from each of the 5 assessment periods) will be randomly selected in an ongoing way in order to monitor and maintain the reliability of the interview process.  An 
Assessment Adherence Monitor, a doctoral -level clinical psychologist at the Behavioral Science 
Divis ion of the National Center for PTSD, will be employed to specifically conduct reliability 
assessment under the supervision of [CONTACT_77534].  In order to maintain reliability, the Monitor will 
provide feedback to Assessors during biweekly supervision sessions t hat will continue 
throughout the study period.  
Training for the Assessors will be standardized and systematically conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Marx.  All Assessors will have been required to have undergone formal training in the administration of the SCID and CAPS, al though training will be standardized nonetheless.  Assessors will conduct 
practice interviews during training at the study’s kickoff meeting and then again upon return to 
their performance site.  They will continue to conduct practice interviews and receiv e feedback 
from the Assessment Adherence Monitor until the Monitor judges them to be calibrated to a 
standard of administration consonant with the intentions of the developers of the respective interviews.  
6. Compensation  
Table VIII.[ADDRESS_346981] amount s in relation to the additional burden.  The 
maximum payment will be $410.  The questionnaire assessment during treatment is extremely 
brief and will not be compensated because it is part of the standard of care.  Payment for screening and baseline assessment will be graduated. Participants who rule out of screening 
based on the suicide screen or the MoCA will be paid $30.   Those who are el igible to continue 
and complete the baseline questionnaires will receive an additional $20.   Participants will be 
paid $50 for completing the phone interview.  Participants will also be reimbursed for travel over 50 miles.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018

Assessment  Payment ($)  
 Screening/baseline/interview  30/20/[ADDRESS_346982] and patient materials developed for the PE and CPT  rollouts to administer the treatments.  The manual for each 
treatment is provided in Volume 2 of the study protocol.   Treatment will be delivered in an 
outpatient setting.  
PE and CPT  will be administered approximately  weekly , although sessions may be held more or 
less frequently than once a week if needed, e.g., to accommodate a patient’s scheduling needs or to help a patient finish treatment within 20 weeks. For the sake of brevity, session frequency 
is described as “weekly” throughout this protocol.  The standard protocol for PE is 8 -15 sessions 
(10 sessions were used for PE in CSP #494),  whereas the standard protocol for CPT is 12. 
Given the flexibility in the number of sessions allowed according to the protocols in the VA 
rollouts, it would be difficult to constrain the total number of sessions to  [ADDRESS_346983] “dose” but to 
allow participants who improve more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_284067] [ADDRESS_346984] Veterans who participate in the trial ( Table VIII.3 ).  The average number of sessions among treatment 
completers is 11- 12.  There are not fixed criteria for determining completion in either rollout , 
however .  In PE, completion is defined as attending at least 8 sessions.  In CPT, completion is 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
44 based on improvement as determined by [CONTACT_284198], which 
is more comparable to what we propose to use. 
Table VIII.3 .  Number of Sessions in Veterans Completing Treatment in the VA Rollouts  
 N Mean ( SD) < 10 10-14 > 14 
Prolonged Exposure  1,723  11.09 (2.62)  28.9% 59.7% 11.4% 
Cognitive Processing Therapy  689 11.83 (1.88)  8.1%  87.0%  4.9%  
We chose to standardize the number of sessions at 12 in both treatments based on the 
available evidence showing that number of sessions is related to improvement in psychotherapy 
(up to a point, at which a longer number of sessions is a reflection of nonresponse to treatment) (e.g., Baldwin et al., 2009; Howard et al., 1986; Steenbarger, 1994) .  Almost none of the 
literature on the dose- response relationship in psychotherapy discuss es session length.  In fact, 
session length is hardly ever reported nor is i t treated as a potentially influential variable.   We 
found no discussions or evidence relevant to our decision to equate number of sessions  and not 
total amount of treatment.  We did find a small naturalistic  study from the PTSD literature in 
which investigators were required to shorten exposure sessions from 90 minutes to 60 minutes during the course of a trial (van Minnen & Foa, 2006).  The results suggested that total amount 
of treatment did not matter.  There were no differences between the [ADDRESS_346985] anything other than large differences, the similarity of findings in both groups was striking.  However, we did not feel that this evidence was sufficient to support a formal change in the PE protocol from 90 to 60 minutes.  
Our approach is  an attempt to optimally balance standardization (to ensure internal validity) and 
flexibility (to enhance generalizability).  Although there are inherent differences in duration of 
sessions in each treatment, we believe it is important to administer them in an ecologically valid way—that is, to not artificially equate the duration of sessions.  Because this is a comparative 
effect iveness trial and not an efficacy study, we believe it is important to administer the 
treatments as they would be used in practice.  We will perform sensitivity analyses to examine 
whether amount of treatment is differentially related to outcome.  
3. Procedures for Early Completion and Additional Sessions  
The standard number of sessions of PE and CPT  will be 12.  However, participants may 
complete treatment with more or fewer sessions depending on their response to treatment.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346986] used flexible dosing of manualized protocols  for treating PTSD (Foa et al., 2005; 
Galovski et al., 2012; Levitt et al., 2007).  Our aim is to optimize standardization and flexibility by 
[CONTACT_284199] (to ensure that they 
are stably improved) and at the same time not requiring extra sessions unless participants have 
failed to achieve an adequate response.  
Participants who have experienced stable remission before completing 12 sessions many 
terminate early.  Stable remission will be defined as 2 consecutive sessions in which the study 
participant  reports (the DSM -5 equivalent of) a PCL score below [ADDRESS_346987] a PCL below 29 for 2 consecutive 
sessions may terminate treatment early and receive the final session content at  the subsequent 
session if they prefer to not complete all 12 sessions (i.e., in session 10 for someone remitted in sessions 8 and 9 and session 11 for someone remitted in sessions 9 and 10).  A score of [ADDRESS_346988] possible score on the PCL that could meet the DSM -IV 
symptom criteria for PTSD , and also corresponds to the definition of remission as a score below 
20 on the CAPS (Weathers et al., 2001) .   
Participants whose PCL scores have not dropped below 50 by [CONTACT_193548] 12 may receive up to 2 
additional sessions depending on their preference for more treatment.   We considered a range 
of scores between 40 and 50 as a threshold for determining whether participants would be 
offered more sessions.  A score of 45 is the average posttreatment PCL among completers in 
the rollouts  (Section I.C.1, Table I.2) and Monson et al.’s (2006) trial of CPT in Veterans ; the 
posttreatment average in CSP #494 was 42 at the end of 10 sessions .  By [CONTACT_2329] 50, we are 
proposing a realistic t hreshold that is clinically meaningful and that many participant s can attain 
without the need for additional treatment.   Accordi ng to data from the CPT rollout, of the 519 
participants who completed 12 or more sessions  (a sta ndard dose) , 60.3% were at or under 49 
on the PCL at session 12.  Note that this does not mean that 40% of participant s in CSP #591 
would require extra sessions, because it does not take into account participant s who completed 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346989] more than the number of weekly 
sessions due to missed appointments, vacations, and other scheduling difficulties.  In CSP 
#494, we attempted to have participant s complete treatment within 16 weeks, although 20 
weeks was allowed if there was consensus between the participant ’s therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], supervisor, and 
study leadership overseeing that treatment condition.  However, although  the standard dose will 
be 12 sessions in CSP #591, we propose to attempt to have participant s complete within 20 
weeks because many participant s are expected to finish in less than 12 sessions .  If participants 
do not complete treatment within 20 weeks, we will offer them 1 -2 additional sessions, including 
the termination session of their assigned treatment.  
4. Adjunctive Services and Attrition Prevention 
We will add a maximum of 2 additional sessions to be used in the event of significant participant  
crises or emergencies that present obstacles to study participation. These “stressor sessions” 
will be allocated within the PE and CPT protocols according to a procedure described by 
[CONTACT_284200]. (2012).   We anticipate, however, that such sessions will be needed infrequently. In a recent study that incorporated this procedure in CPT (Galovski et al., 2012), only 13 out of 100 participant s required such a session, at a rate of one per p articipant . 
These sessions will be used to address significant psychosocial stressors or emergencies (such as death in the family, diagnosis of life -threatening illness, notice of home foreclosure, sudden 
loss of job with family needs dependent on income) that (a) occur during the course of treatment, (b) cannot be integrated into the ongoing PE or CPT treatment, and (c) are deemed likely to significantly interfere with a participant’s ability to take part in PE or CPT if not 
addressed in depth.  
If after a collaborative discussion with a participant a study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284068] a stressor 
session is necessary, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284069].  Participants will be 
informed that a maximum of two such special sessions will be available to them as part of the 
study and that they can decide whether they need to use one of these extra sessions to discuss 
the stressor or continue with the PE or CPT protocol as usual.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
47 The stressor session will focus on providing support, problem -solving the stressor situation, 
and/or applying PE- or CPT -related intervention components to the issue at hand.   Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284070], while also respecting the need to attend to emerging crises.   These procedures are 
broadly consistent with usual practice in VA PTSD treatment. In the PE and  CPT rollouts, 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284071].  
Stressor sessions may occur current with, but outside of, study treatment.  Alternatively, study treatment may be stopped temporarily if this is necessary for the participant to address the crisis.  In the event that the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284072] 2 sessions are 
needed to attend to a crisis, then the participant will be removed from study treatment, but allowed to resume therapy outside of the study if and when the participant chooses to do so. 
5. Additional Procedures to Address Suicide Risk  
Study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284073] -9 
at the beginning of each therapy session. If risk is indicated by [CONTACT_2299]’s r esponses to 
Item 1.[ADDRESS_346990]’s observations during the course of  normal interactions with 
the participant , a careful assessment guided by [CONTACT_284201].  
If at any time a participant is found to be at risk for suicide and in need of intervention, the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284074] a safety plan with the participant. All suicide safety plans will be created according to the standard procedures described in the VA manual, “Safety Plan Treatment Manual to Reduce Suicide Risk: Veteran Version” (Stanley & Brown, 2008). This plan may 
include support from the VA, family contacts and friends, and other people the participant trusts. 
The safety plan will also incorporate the VA Veterans Crisis Line phone number: 1 -800-273-
TALK (8255) as a support outlet.  We will report these events as an AE if identified during the course of treatment. Failure of the participant to comply with the safety plan will require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284075].  
During phone interviews at posttreatment and follow -up, the telephone assessor will screen for 
suicide risk using the protocol that is used for screening at enrollment.   If responses
 indicate 
significant risk, the telephone assessor will conduct a risk assessment.  If the assessment 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346991] procedures described in the VA manual, “Safety Plan Treatment Manual to Reduce Suicide Risk: Veteran Version” (Stanley & Brown, 2008). This plan may include support from the VA, family contacts and friends, and other people the participant trusts. All safety plans will also incorporate the VA Veteran Crisis Line 
phone number: 1- 800-273-TALK (8255) as a support outlet.  
All suicide attempts and completions will be considered SAEs, and as such, will be reported to 
the study Executive Committee, Central IRB, and the DMC by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_284076], in addition to other standard VA reporting requirements. The DMC will monitor all SAEs regularly (at least every 6 months) throughout the study and assess potential for increased risks to participants. The DMC may also impose requirements for more frequent monitoring of SAEs .  
6. Additional Treatment  
As in CSP #420 and CSP #494, participants may receive some additional types of non-study 
treatment while receiving study therapy.  They are allowed to stay on medication, attend self -
help groups, and receive treatment for mental health problems other than PTSD.  Participants who have a usual therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284077].  In addition, participants who develop problems requiring additional inpatient or outpatient treatment will be allowed to receive the additional treatment.  They may stay enrolled in study treatment if this would be clinically appropriate, as determined by [CONTACT_284202][INVESTIGATOR_541], the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s study supervisor, and the Local Site Investigator.  After completing 
treatment, participants will be allowed to resume any PTSD treatment that was discontinued or to seek additional treatment for PTSD.   We will use a specifically detailed measure to assess 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
49 medication use during treatment that was developed for CSP #494, expanding the measure to 
capture psychotherapy.   
Based on our prior experience, the majority of participant s will be on some kind of medication 
and the clinicians prescribing the medication may wish to change drugs or dose while the participant is receiving study treatment.  In CSP #494, this happened more in the comparison 
group than in the PE group , we suspect, because clinicians were attempting to compensate for 
participants’ assignment to the comparison group.  Our approach in both CSP #420 and CSP 
#[ADDRESS_346992] participant  
preferences.  Medication changes were handled at the site level by [CONTACT_284203], 
sometimes with the involvement of the LSI .   
In CSP #[ADDRESS_346993]. Friedman will perform this function by [CONTACT_284204], utilizing his experience providing similar consultation thr ough VA’s National 
PTSD Consultation Program.  The goal is not to prevent clinicians from doing what they feel is 
in the best interes ts of participants , but rather, to standardize insofar as possible the use of 
medications across participants and sites and discourage ineffective or potentially harmful 
prescribing practices.  We will use a blinded consult request form (modeled after the form 
currently used in the PTSD Consultation Program) so that [CONTACT_6033] can remain blind to a 
participant’s assigned treatment condition during these consults.  Clinicians also will be reminded to not discuss participants’ treatment assignment with [CONTACT_6033] during any discussions that follow.  
C. Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Experience with PE and CPT in the rollouts indicates that some participants will have temporary 
disruptions of study treatment due to other comorbid problems or life events, but that participant s typi[INVESTIGATOR_284078].  However, participants 
will be discontinued from treatment if they  show substantial worsening of PTSD, other 
symptoms, or functioning requiring lengthy hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284079].  For intent -to-treat purposes, all participants, including those who are terminated from 
treatment early, will be followed at posttreatment and at [ADDRESS_346994] or their non-
study clinician  (if they have one).  When a participant is identified as requiring discontinuation 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346995] ([CONTACT_284267] for PE and [CONTACT_284268] for CPT) and Supervisor for that participant’s assigned condition in 
order to obtain official study permission to discontinue treatment.  Then, in conjunction with the appropriate clinicians, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_284080]’s decision.  
D. Withdrawals  
Participants may withdraw from study treatment or from the study at any time.  Those who 
withdraw from study treatment but wish to continue in the study will participate in study 
assessments according to the protocol.  Those who withdraw consent will not be followed.  
If a participant withdraws from the study (or is declared lost to follow -up), the participant may be 
re-consented and complete his or her participation in study treatment and/or study 
assessments.  
E. Post Follow -up Procedures 
After completing study treatment and follow -up, participants will not be followed.  They may 
continue any ongoing treatment or initiate new treatment for PTSD. 
F. Training and Supervision  
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284081]; this requires 
comprehensive review of training cases.  Study training, aside from specific instruction 
regarding the protocol and documentation, will consist of a 1- day review of the therapy protocols 
to ensure that the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284082].  To establish therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284083], potential study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284084]- recorded treatment 
sessions prior to selection.  T hese sessions will be reviewed by a senior clinician who is 
approved to provide case consultation in the VA rollouts in order to establish adherence and 
competence with the treatments.  
Therapy Supervisors , two for PE and two for CPT, will be selected to train and consult with 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346996] completed all VA provider training 
elements and review of audio recordings will be necessary to confirm therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ proficiency 
before entry into the trial.  However, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284085]- record every session for 
quality control.  If there are concerns about a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284086] a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284087], one of the Master Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284088].  
G. Therapy Fidelity Monitoring  
Monitoring of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284089] y, i.e., that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284090].  Independent monitoring 
will provide a detailed assessment of adherence to the manuals and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284091] e. 
Using procedures developed in our prior studies (CSP #420 and #494), an independent Fidelity 
Monito r (a senior clinician who is not involved in training or consultation  in the study ), will rate 
two audio recordings from each study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284092].      
  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
52 IX. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
A. Data Management  
The Palo Alto CSPCC will be responsible for the management and the quality control of the 
data.  After the study is approved, data forms will be finalized and field tested.  An Operations Manual will be provided to the investigators to guide the operation and management of the 
study.  A training session at the kickoff meeting is planned prior to the initiation of participant 
enrollment for all study personnel to assure uniformity in participant management and data collection procedures, and to train all study personnel in study procedures.  The Study Coordinator at each medical center and the Independent Assessors at the [LOCATION_011] VA Medical Center will  complete data forms on a daily basis and transmit them  to the CSPCC. If paper 
forms are used, t he original f orms will be kept in the LSI's study files.  
DataFax, a clinical trial data management system (by [CONTACT_284205], Inc.), will be used for data collection and management.  DataFax allows for paper data form collection as well as electronic data capture (EDC).  The Study Coordinators from the sites and the 
Independent Assessors will complete case report forms (CRFs) and fax them directly to the 
DataFax computer server, where data images of the CRFs are stored as files.  The system uses an optical cha racter recognition (OCR) paradigm to automatically process and store the 
information from the image as data into the study database. The original fax image is also stored. Data management staff at CSPCC will review each CRF by [CONTACT_141417].  If electronic CRFs are used, the Study 
Coordinators and the Independent Assessors will log into the web- based DataFax system and 
enter study data directly, rather than completing and sending a paper CRF.  
In the case of the Veteran Feedback Form s, since Veterans will have the option of hand- writing 
responses to open- ended questions, the SC will scan the form and load it directly onto the 
CSPCC secure server, in a site -specific folder .  The original scanned image will be stored, and 
manual data entry will be used for both quantitative and qualitative responses.  
Data management staff at CSPCC will review CRFs for protocol adherence data consistency, and add data queries to items that fail these checks.  Checks will  be performed manually and 
programmatically.  On a regular basis, data management staff will produce site- specific Quality 
Control reports that list all unresolved data queries.  Data management staff will make the reports available to each site and work with the Study Coordinators and the Independent 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346997] final analyses of the study data.  
Study reports will be generated using DataFax, SAS, Atlas.ti (for qualitative data analyses) , and 
other tools (e.g., Microsoft Excel and Access).  SAS and other statistical software packages will be used to conduct data analysis for the study.  The CSPCC was using SAS Version 9.[ADDRESS_346998] completed required VA security trainings.  Only CSP -approved individuals (such as: staff 
at the study site, CSPCC, and CSP Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center (CSPCRPCC)) will have access to the personal health information (PHI) of study participants.  
Research data will only be stored on secure VA servers within the VA firewall (and not on desktops or on University affiliate servers). The data will be coded with a unique study identifier for each participant and stored using that study identifier. Identifiable information will be 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_346999] health care usage data. 
Coded clinical data will be stored separately from the participant’s name, contact [CONTACT_3031], and real SSN.  Access to the cross -walk file linking the participant’s identifiers and their study 
data will be restricted to the clinical site and to the study staff at the CSPCC.  
In case of improper use or disclosure of study data, the facility’s ISO and Privacy Officer, and 
the individual’s direct supervisor will be notified immediately per VA Directive and Handbook 
6500.  Records will be maintained and destroyed per the VHA Records Control Schedule (RCS 10-1).  
Quality control checks and clinical monitoring will enable the CSPCC to examine the database and the clinical sites to ensure data have not been improperly used or accessed. Audit trails and access logs compliant with [ADDRESS_347000] practices.

This study is a prospective randomized clinical trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of 
Prolonged Exposure (PE) to Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) for the treatment of PTSD in 
veterans.  The primary outcome is the change of CAPS total score from baseline (pre-
treatment) to the average in the six months post-treatment (measured at immediate post -
treatment, 3 and 6 months follow -up visits).  We chose to use the average in the six months 
post-treatment in the definition of primary outcome (versus using a single post -treatment 
timepoint) because we anticipate that improvement established during the course of treatment 
will be sustained in the [ADDRESS_347002] size is defined as Δμ/η, Δμ is the mean difference in the primary outcome between PE and CPT, and η is the standard deviation of the change of CAPS total score from 
baseline to a specific post -treatment timepoint. By [CONTACT_284206] #494’s estimated standard 
deviation η=19.6, the effect size of 0.25 translates to a Δμ=4.[ADDRESS_347003] 90% power to detect Δμ=5 in the primary outcome.  
Cohen (1988) defined 0.[ADDRESS_347004] a difference as small as 0.25, then any failure to find a difference between treatments could be seen as inconclusive— which was the problem  with the 
only study that directly compared the treatments (Resick et al., 2002).  If the true difference between the effects of PE and CPT is less than 0.25, this would be clinically insignificant. 
Although our sample size calculation is based on DSM -IV CAPS total score data observed in 
the CSP#494, the effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_347005] a negligible difference in inflation factors between DSM versions.  Therefore, the sample size derived below is appropriate for CAPS on DSM -5 .

56 B. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
1. Planned primary analysis for the primary outcome 
Linear mixed effects models (SAS PROC MIXED) will be used to compare the primary outcome 
between the two treatment groups.  The mixed effects model will include time, treatment, 
treatment by [CONTACT_284207], and participant and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284094].  Specifically let 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denote the CAPS total score measured at timepoint 𝑘𝑘 for the 𝑗𝑗th 
participant treated by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_541] 𝑖𝑖.  The mixed effects model for the primary analysis is:  
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=  𝛼𝛼+𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖+𝛾𝛾𝑧𝑧(𝑖𝑖)+(𝛽𝛽𝛾𝛾)𝑖𝑖𝑧𝑧(𝑖𝑖)+𝜃𝜃𝑇𝑇𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖1{𝑖𝑖≠0}+𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, 
where 𝑖𝑖 =

is randomized to, 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 is the time effect (fixed), 𝛾𝛾𝑧𝑧(𝑖𝑖) is the treatment effect (fixed), (𝛽𝛽𝛾𝛾)𝑖𝑖𝑧𝑧(𝑖𝑖) is the 
time by [CONTACT_9866] (fixed), 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denotes the vector of other covariates in the model

the random therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284095]  𝑖𝑖, 1{𝑖𝑖≠0} is the indicator for 𝑘𝑘 not equal to zero, 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the 
random participant effect for participant 𝑗𝑗 treated by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_541] 𝑖𝑖, 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  is the random error at the 
𝑘𝑘th timepoint for participant j treated by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_541] i.  While other covariance structures will be 
used to assess their impact on study results, for simplicity and ease of interpretation we assume 
in the primary analysis that 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖, 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  are independent and have the following distributions:  
𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖~𝑁𝑁(0,𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃2), 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖~𝑁𝑁(0,𝜎𝜎𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵2), 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, ~𝑁𝑁(0,𝜎𝜎𝑊𝑊𝐵𝐵2). 
Under 
this mixed effects model,  the variance of CAPS total score at timepoint k is 
𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 (𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖)  =  𝜎𝜎2 =  𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃21{𝑖𝑖≠0} + 𝜎𝜎𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵2 +  𝜎𝜎𝑊𝑊𝐵𝐵2 
Note 
that we allow the improvement in CAPS total score to vary at these three post- treatment 
timepoints in the mixed effects model; the contrast or estimate statement in SAS will be used to 
estimate and compare the primary outcome between PE and CPT.  Although we anticipate the improvement in CAPS total score established in the treatment course will sustain for [ADDRESS_347007] study treatment.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_347008]-
treatment timepoints, the variance of the primary outcome for this participant is  
𝜏𝜏2=𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃2+𝜎𝜎𝑊𝑊𝐵𝐵2
𝑡𝑡+𝜎𝜎𝑊𝑊𝐵𝐵2, 
where 𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃2 is the variance of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284096] 𝜎𝜎𝑊𝑊𝐵𝐵2 is the within -subject variation of 
the CAPS total score.  Under the simplified assumptions that all study participants have CAPS 
total score measured at pre- treatment and at  t post-treatment timep oints and that each study 
participant is treated by a different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], the sample size per treatment group needed to 
achieve power 1-β to detect a mean difference of ∆𝜇𝜇 between PE and CPT in the primary 
outcome, using a two- sided t -test with two -sided significance level α is: 
𝑛𝑛=2�𝑧𝑧1−𝛼𝛼 /2+𝑧𝑧1−𝛽𝛽�2
(∆𝜇𝜇/𝜏𝜏)2 
The estimated variance components from CSP #494 are  𝜎𝜎2=678 ,𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃2=36,𝜎𝜎𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵2=504 ,𝜎𝜎𝑊𝑊𝐵𝐵2=
174, and thus 𝜏𝜏=16.4 when t=3 and 𝜏𝜏=17.2 when t = 2.  Therefore if we assume all 
participants have complet e follow -up CAPS total score ( t = 3), it requires a total of 452 
participants (226 per group) to have 90% power to detect a difference of ∆𝜇𝜇 = [ADDRESS_347009] -treatment CAPS total 
scores ( t = 2), it requires 498 participants (249 per group) to have 90% power.  
3. Adjus
ting for correlations due to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284097], each therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284098] a number of study participants.  
Although the treatment will be delivered on an individual basis, observations from the participants treated by [CONTACT_284208][INVESTIGATOR_284099].  Assuming each therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284100] m study participants, the sample size obtained under the independent participants 
assumption (in Section X.B. 2) needs to be inflated by [CONTACT_284209] f to retain the 
same power (Campbell et al., 2007; Machin et al., 2009):  
𝑓𝑓= 1 + (𝑚𝑚− 1)𝜌𝜌, 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_347010]-treatment measurements, ρ  can b e expressed as  
𝜌𝜌=𝜎𝜎

𝜏𝜏2=𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃2
𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃2+𝜎𝜎𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊2
𝑡𝑡+𝜎𝜎𝑊𝑊𝐵𝐵2. 
Using the variance estimates from CSP #494, ρ  = 0.134 when t = 3.  The Planning Committee 
determined that it is reasonable to assume each therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284101] ( m = 8). It follows that f = 1+(8 -1)*0.134 = 1.94. Hence 
a total of 878 participants (439 per group) is needed to provide 90% power to detect Δμ = 5 in the primary outcome (assuming each participant has baseline CAPS total score and complete follow -up CAPS total score at immediate post -treatment and at [ADDRESS_347011] treatment) 
as shown in Table X.1 below.

[ADDRESS_347012] -treatment timepoints.  If each participant has t = 2 follow -up CAPS total score 
(instead of 3), then ρ  = 0.121, f = 1.85,  and it requires a total of 920 participants (460 per group) 
to provide 90% power to detect Δμ=5 in the primary outcome, using the same values of 
variance components as above.   In CSP #49 4, about 75% of participants had all follow -up 
CAPS total scores, and the average number of follow -up CAPS total scores is 2.45.  In this 
study we expect a higher proportion of participants to have complete follow -up CAPS total score 
because CAPS assessment will be conducted over telephone, not requiring a clinical visit from 
the participant.  To protect against missing CAPs total scores, potential deviations of the various variances from the assumed values and possible deviation that some therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284102] t reat more 
than 8 participants, we plan to randomize 900 participants in this study (450 per group).  See

4. Alternative derivation  
We have also derived sample size inflation factor for more general scenarios that allow 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284104]-treatment CAPS total scores.  This sample size inflation factor is calculated by [CONTACT_284211], in which the mean change from baseline is computed over all individual changes from baseline at all post -treatment points from all participants.  While we skip the derivation formula and results 
here, in the special case that each therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284105] -treatment CAPS total score assessed at the same 
timepoints, the sample size f ormula reduces to that in the previous subsection.  
C. Number of Participating Sites and Duration of Study  
We will select sites that have high patient volume and at least 8 trained therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (4 PE and 4 
CPT) to deliver study treatments.  Sites with research infrastructure and research experience 
are also preferred.  Each participating site is expected to randomize 64 participants over the 
course of the study (8 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284106] 8 participants). Therefore, 14.1 sites are needed 
to achieve the target tot al randomization of 900. Because some participants are found to be 
ineligible for the study af ter signing consent (i.e. during Phase 2 or Phase 3 Screening 
procedures), the total number of enrolled (i.e. consented) participants in the study may be as high as 2550 (150 per site) to reach the randomization goal of 900.    
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_347014] more than 1500 unique PTSD outpatients in FY 2011.  We anticipate a large proportion of these PTSD outpatients will be eligible for the current study because our 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are nonrestrictive.  Even if only 5% of these patients are 
enrolled, a site with at least [ADDRESS_347015] for 3 months.  Start -up and closeout for the Study Chairs’ 
Office, Palo Alto CSPCC and CRPCC at Albuquerque will be 6 months and 3 months, respectively.  The Chairs’ Office, CSPCC and CRPCC will require [ADDRESS_347016] to demographic and baseline physical and psychological characteristics.  Summary statistics (e.g., means and standard errors for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables) and graphical techniques (e.g., boxplots for continuous variables, and histograms for categorical variables), 
will be used to compare the baseline characteristics of the two treatment groups within study 
sites a nd the whole study.  In addition, we will use t -tests to compare continuous variables and 
Chi square tests for categorical variables.  
2. Primary objective  
The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of PE and CPT for reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_284212].  The primary outcome is change of 
CAPS total score from baseline (pre- treatment) to the average in the six months post -treatment 
(measured at post -treatment and 3 and 6 months follow -up visits).   
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
61 Primary analysis : The primary analysis will follow the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle.  Participants 
will be counted in the treatment group to which they were randomized, regardless of the number 
of sessions they completed.  Linear mixed effects models, with time, treatment, treatment by [CONTACT_284213][INVESTIGATOR_284107], will be used to estimate and compare the primary outcome between PE and CPT.  The point estimate 
and the 95% confidence interval for the mean difference will be provided.  
Secondary analysis: We will provide point estimates and pointwise 95% confidence intervals for 
the mean differences in the CAPS total scores at the three post- treatment timepoints as well as 
the mean differences in changes of CAPS total score from baseline at these post -treatment 
timepoints.  We will also compare the longitudinal profiles of CAPS total score (including the 
mid-treatment and post -treatment scores) between PE and CPT by [CONTACT_284214].  When data permits, we will explore site variations in treatment effect and also 
explore the impact of different covariance variance structures (e.g., allowing the variance of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284108]).  
Although we anticipate minimum missing data in CAPS total score, we will perform analyses to examine the missing data patterns and the impact of missing data. See Section X.F  for more 
details.  
As in CSP #494, we will use the CAPS to  derive additional measures of clinical outcomes: 
response (defined as at least 10 -point improvement in severity), loss of diagnosis (response 
plus no longer meeting DSM symptom criteria), and remission (loss of diagnosis plus the DSM -5 
score that corresponds to a DSM -IV severity score < 20).  The observed proportions and their 
95% confidence intervals will be provided for each treatment group at each of the follow -up 
timepoints.  Chi -square tests will be used to compare these outcomes between the two 
treatment groups.  
3. Secondary objective  
The secondary objective is to compare the effectiveness of PE and CPT for reducing the severity of comorbid mental health problems and service utilization and improving functioning and quality of life.  
These secondary outcome measures, listed in Table X.3  below, will be compared between PE 
and CPT to support the comparative effectiveness of these two treatments in CAPS total score. 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
62 Except for Brief Addiction Monitor and certain service utilization outcomes (which are 
catego rical measures), all other secondary outcomes are continuous measures and will be 
analyzed in a manner similar to CAPS total score as described above.  Generalized linear mixed effects models (SAS PROC GLIMMIX) will be used to compare the longitudinal prof iles of 
the categorical measures between PE and CPT. Generalized estimating equations may also be 
used.  We do not plan to adjust for multiple comparisons due to the supportive nature of these 
secondary outcomes.

4. Tertiary objective  
The tertiary objective is to examine whether discrepancy between patient preferences and 
treatment assignment reduces the effectiveness of each treatment.  We will calculate the frequencies and percentages of participants’ treatment preference in the entire study sample and also by [CONTACT_3725], sex,  and trauma type.  We will examine the impact of participant’s treatment 
preference on treatment effectiveness.  Participant’s treatment preference, collected before randomization, will be included as a covariate in the regression models to assess if the effectiveness of the treatment on the primary and selected secondary outcomes differs between 
participants who received their preferred treatment and those who did not receive their preferred treatment.  We will also examine if there are differences in treatment adherence and completeness of follow -up.  This analysis will be performed in the combined sample and also 
within each treatment arm.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_347018] in the primary outcome by 
[CONTACT_284215] 95% confidence estimates within subgroups.  The purpose of these exploratory analyses is to detect apparent reversals of effect or major quantitative interactions, in order to describe the 
uniformity or variation of effect appropriately.  One major subgroup analysis concerns the sex of 
the participant.  By [CONTACT_284216] , we will try to recruit sites with large pools of 
female PTSD patients in this study; however, despi[INVESTIGATOR_180314], it is not expected that we will be able to recruit a sufficient number of females to provide more than a preliminary idea of the effect in that subgroup.  Other major subgroups will be era, age, race/ethnicity, MST, TBI, 
comorbid depression, and comorbid substance abuse.  Because of the exploratory nature of these analyses, we do not plan to adjust for multiple comparisons.
 
We will also compare the following variables between PE and CPT: (1) the proportions of study 
participants meeting the stable remission criterion [early (<12 weeks), on time (12 weeks), late 
(>12 weeks), did not reach remission], by [CONTACT_177610] -square tests; (2) the numb er of weeks to reach 
the stable remission criterion, by [CONTACT_284217]; and (3) the number of sessions and total number 
of hours delivered, by [CONTACT_1192]- sample t -tests.  Mixed effects models or generalized estimating 
equations may be used to incorporate correlati ons due to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284109]. 
Interpretation of these results will incorporate early withdrawal of study treatment, early withdrawal of study, and initiation of non -study treatment for PTSD.  We will also examine 
whether and how treatment dose (such as number of sessions and total number of hours), treatment engagement (homework) and treatment fidelity (therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169373]) relate to primary and secondary outcomes within and between treatments, and 
whether and how time to stable remission (such as early vs. on time vs. late) relates to 
outcomes within and between treatments. 
E. Interim Analysis 
In the conduct of clinical trials, there is an ethical obligation to review the data on safety, study 
conduct and progress, study feasibility, and efficacy over the course of the study.  These study data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_23275] (DMC) at least every [ADDRESS_347019] meeting, the DMC will discuss and decide how it will 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_347020] interim monitoring for CSP #591. A prototype set of tables and figures for purposes of 
monitoring are given in the appendix section called, “Biostatistical Research Data Processing (BRDP)”.  
1. Monitoring of safety and study progress  
Study safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_284218] (CS PCRPCC), and reported to the DMC at least every 6 months. A complete description 
of monitoring and reporting adverse events is given in Section XI .  In the event that serious 
adverse events are noted to be excessive in either group, the DMC may consider 
recommending the study be stopped.  
In addition to interim monitoring for safety, the DMC will also monitor patient intake (overall and within site), site adherence to the study protocol, data quality, completeness and timeliness of follow up and data submission, and baseline comparability of treatment groups.  The DMC will review the accumulating data and be responsible for determining whether or not to recommend to the CSR&D Director that the trial be continued or stopped.  Data summaries will be prepared 
for the DMC for these purposes.  To aid the DMC in their deliberations, other relevant 
information pertaining to (e.g., secondary analyses) and outside of (e.g., other studies) CSP 
#[ADDRESS_347021] interim analyses to allow early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284110] (when there is sufficient evidence that one treatment is superior to the other treatment) or for futility (when it is futile to e stablish a statistical significant difference at the end of the trial). 
The rationales are (1) both PE and CPT are effective treatments for PTSD, so there are no ethical concerns in continuing the study even when it is unlikely to establish a statistical 
significant difference at the end of the trial; (2) even when there are treatment differences 
between PE and CPT, the differences are not likely to alter the VA policy to make all evidence-based treatment available to PTSD patients based on interim analysis  results; (3) it is important 
from a public health, policy, and scientific perspective to collect sufficient data on the secondary outcomes to support findings in the primary outcome, in the hope that the totality of the evidence will be able to provide guidance to or change clinical practice; (4) it allows us to examine the impact of patient preference on treatment effectiveness, which is one of the key elements in personalized medicine.   
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
65 F. Procedure for Handling Missing Data  
It is expected that there will be some missing data.  Imputation techniques, such as linear 
interpolation and multiple imputation methods will be examined to assess the robustness on the results.  Completer analyses will also be done based on participants who remained in the study throughout the 6 -month follow -up period.  When large fractions of information are missing, we 
will perform sensitivity analyses under weaker assumptions (e.g., non -ignorable missingness).  
It is recognized, however, that the best approach to missing data is to make all efforts to minimize it, since imputation is difficult when the missing data are non- ignorable or not missing 
at random.  We will attempt to collect outcome data from all participants at all timepoints regardless of whether they continue or complete the study treatment.  We will also attempt to collect reasons for missing data when possible.  Also, the telephone CAPS assessment can facilitate completeness by [CONTACT_284219], who will not have to 
travel for assessment sessions.  
G. Procedures for Reporting Modifications to the Original Statistical Plan 
Changes to the original statistical plan for analyzing study data will follow the CSP standard operating procedures for amending the study protocol, which require review and approval by [CONTACT_284220]. As needed, updates may also be required to other study documents such as the Case Report Forms and Operations Manual.  
 
  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_347022] medical occurrence, thereby [CONTACT_17155]:  a) protection of safety of study participants, b) a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the study treatments and 
therapeutic modalities, c) improvements in study design or procedures, and d) compliance with 
regulatory requirements.  
B. Role of the Local Site Investigator in Adverse Event Monitoring  
The LSI  will be responsible for the adverse event reporting requirements as outlined below:  
• Reviewing the accuracy and completeness of all adverse events (AE) reported. 
• Compliance with VA CIRB policies for reporting AEs and/or serious adverse events 
(SAEs).  
[ Note:  In June 2015, the VA published an update to “Reporting of Adverse Events in 
Research to the Office of Research Oversight (ORO)” in VHA Handbook 1058.1.  Investigators 
should be aware of these  reporting requirement s.  This, however, does not eliminate the need 
for investigators to report both adverse events and serious adverse events to the CSP #591 Sponsor as per the study protocol.]  
• Closely monitoring research participants at each study visit for any new SAEs.  
C. Collecti on of Safety Information  
1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) are defined by [CONTACT_8639] (ICH) for Clinical Safety Data Management (ICH -E2A) as “any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical 
investigation subject that is subjected to one of the study treatments that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatments.  An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the study interventions.”  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
67 For the purposes of CSP #591, the study treatments are a) the Prolonged Exposure (PE) 
treatment and related activities and b) the Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) treatment and related activities.   
In this study , information on AEs related to or possibly related to study treatments and on all 
serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected and recorded. See the section below on 
“Relatedness”.  There is a separate section below that describes the collection of saf ety 
information for SAEs.  
The reporting period for AEs begins when the participant signs the informed consent form and 
continues until the participant’s completion or early termination of study participation or the end of the study.  Each related/possibly related AE will be reported to the Sponsor, the VA 
Cooperative Studies Program, including any increase in frequency or severity of a condition that was present prior to the start of the study.  During the study, adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- ended questioning, examination, or evaluation of 
the participant at study visits.   
Related or possibly related adverse events not meeting the criteria for an SAE (see below) must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form.  (Those that  meet SAE criteria are documented on the 
SAE Form). One form should be completed for each AE reported.  Adverse events should be reported in sequential order as they occur and submitted with the other case report forms for the participant’s visit.   
a. Advers e Event Classification  
Severity:  
Mild Does not interfere with normal activity (not reportable)  
Moderate  Interferes with normal activity to some extent  
Severe  Interferes significantly with normal activity   
Note: Only AEs classified as either “Moderate” or “Severe” must be reported.  
Examples of Mild (not reportable) vs. Moderate (reportable) Adverse Events  
1. Pre-existing conditions that are documented in the medical record at the time of 
informed consent: only report as AEs (moderate or severe) those that increase in 
frequency and or severity.  
2. Arthritis:  Normal waxing and waning – do not report.  Pain that requires a steroid 
injection or prevents patient from moving around as normal → report as an AE.  
3. Headache:  Common type of headache that may require a non- steroidal agent that 
occurs every once in awhile → do not report as an AE.  Migraine -like headache that 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
68 keeps the patient in bed with no light or prevents him/her from going to work → 
report as an AE.  
4. Report any adverse event after informed consent that is associated with new 
diagnoses, e.g. hypertension, anxiety, depression, etc.  
5. Common colds:  Do not report as an AE unless cold develops into pneumonia or some other type of serious upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416].
 
6. To further differentiate between mild and moderate – if patient can still do normal 
activities of living in spi[INVESTIGATOR_284111] “adverse event” → do not report as an AE.  If the AE 
prevents the patient from being able to do one or more activities of daily living, it 
would be considered “moderate” → report as an AE.  If the AE results in the patient 
needing to go to the ER or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], it would be considered an SAE and should also 
be reported on an SAE Form.    
 
b. Relatedness  
The investigator and sub -investigators are responsible for determining if an adverse event may 
be related with one of the study treatments based on their medical expert[INVESTIGATOR_18700], familiarity with the 
therapeutic category of the study treatment, and the emergence of the general clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_284112].   Recall that only related or possibly related AEs that do not meet SAE criteria are reported on study forms.  
Relatedness involves an assessment of the degree of causality (attributability) between the study intervention and the event.  The assessment provided by [CONTACT_284221] a patient safety concern.  Pursuant to CSP Global SOP 3.6, an AE is deemed to be associated with the use of a study intervention if “[t]here is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_284222].” Thus, all adverse events with a reasonable causal relationship to the study intervention should be considered “related”.  A definite relationship does not need to be established.  The following levels of relatedness will be used in this trial: 
• Not attributed to a study intervention 
• Possibly attributed to a study intervention 
• Attributed to a study intervention  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_347023] be reported as Serious Adverse Events (SAE) if they meet the SAE reporting requirements described below.   
2. Serious Adverse Events  
a. Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Serious adverse events are defined by [CONTACT_284223] 3.6. 3, as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life threatening,  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
• Is an important medical event  that may not result in death, be life- threatening , or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (an event may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, it may jeopardize the participant  and may require medical  or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition).  
Any adverse event that meets the definition of “Serious” will be reported on an SAE Form.  All SAEs will be classified as either “related,” "possibly related," or “not related” to study intervention.  A definite  causal relationship does not need to be established.  
b. Serious Adverse Event Monitoring 
Participants will be monitored for SAEs at each study visit.  Each serious adverse event is reported on an SAE Form.  Active monitoring for SAEs begins at the time the Informed Consent Form is signed and continues until the earlier of the 30 days after the participant’s completion or early termination of study participation or the end of the study.  The date study participation ends is entered on the Study Completion/Termination Form.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
70 D. Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs require prompt reporting to the CSP Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center 
(CSPCRPCC) within 7 2 hours of the LSI  becoming aware of the event. The CSP #591 Adverse 
Event (AE) Speci alist at the CSPCRPCC is responsible for evaluating all SAEs for patient safety 
concerns and regulatory reporting.  The AE Specialist will consult with the Chairman’s office 
during the review process, as necessary.  CSPCPRCC maintains a database of serious  events 
for evaluation, by [CONTACT_198515] (MedDRA) for coding 
and trending.  Periodic summaries will be provided to the Data Monitoring Committee, the Study Chairman’s office and Executive Committee (as necessary).  Events that are determined to be serious, unexpected, and related to the study treatments will be r eported to the LSI s, CIRB, and 
to the VA Cooperative Studies Program Central Office.  
SAE Forms will be sent to the Palo Alto CSPCC.  The CSPCRPCC will also have access to the 
information on the SAE Forms.  
1. SAE Follow -up Reporting 
Serious adverse events should be followed to resolution, stabilization, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.  If an SAE is still ongoing by [CONTACT_284224], complete an SAE Follow -up Form every 30 days until the SAE is resolved or 
stabilized.  SAE Follow -up Forms will be sent to the Palo Alto CSPCC.  
E. Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events to the VA Central IRB  
It is th e responsibility of the LSI / SC  at each participating site to know and comply with the AE 
and SAE reporting requirements of the VA CIRB.  Information on VA CIRB’s reporting requirements can be found on the VA CIRB website ( http://www.research.va.gov/vacentralirb/

Questions about managing or reporting of adverse events or serious adverse events will be addressed by [CONTACT_284226] #591 National Study Coordinator.   In all instances of AE, C entral IRB procedures and VHA Handbook 1058.01 will be 
followed.  
 
  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
71 XII. QUALITY CONTROL  
A. Standardization/Validation of Measurements  
Details about quality control for assessment procedures are provided in Sections VIII.A.3-5  
(procedures to enhance completion of assessment protocols, double- blinding, and reliability).  
B. Treatment  
Details about quality control for treatment are provided in Sections VIII.F (training and 
supervision) and VIII.G  (therapy fidelity monitoring).  
C. Masking  
Centrally located interviews will perform assessment by [CONTACT_756], which minimizes the risk of 
unblinding.  In addition, assessors will remind participants not to reveal their treatment 
assignment during the assessment interviews.  
D. Monitoring Participant Intake and Probation/Termination of Participating Centers  
During the course of a study, it may be necessary to drop one or more participating medical centers from the study. Such action must have the prior approval of the CSPCC Director  and 
the Director of VA CSR&D.  Early termination is usually based on recommendations from the Executive Committee and the DMC  and most often reflects inadequate participant intake or 
serious noncompliance with Good Clinical Practices.  This action should always be based on the best interests of the study and study participants and does not necessarily imply poor performance on t he part of the SI or the medical center.  Termination will be conducted per CSP 
guidelines.  
1. Enrollment Issues  
The Study Chairs and the Study Biostatistician will monitor the intake rate and operational aspects of the study. Participating medical centers will continue in the study only if adequate 
participant intake is maintained. The Executive Committee may take action leading to the 
discontinuation of enrollment at a center with the concurrence of the CSPCC Director and the Director of VA CSR&D. If recruit ment is not proceeding at an appropriate rate, the Study Chairs 
and Study Biostatistician will scrutinize the reasons for participant exclusions and other barriers to recruitment.  Based on this information, the Executive Committee may choose, with the approval of the DMC and the Director, VA CSR&D, to drop centers, add additional centers, 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
72 make minor modifications to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, or extend the recruitment period. 
Participating sites that enroll below target during the first [ADDRESS_347024] to reduced funding or possible termination as a study site. To prevent the delay in adding new sites, we plan to start the study with 17 recrui ting sites, which is about 3 more than needed from the sample size requirement of 14.1.  
The Executive Committee will take actions leading to discontinuation of a site only with the concurrence of the CSPCC Director. If a site is terminated from the trial,  resources will be 
reallocated to other medical centers or used to start up a back -up site.   Central IRB will be 
informed of all site terminations and probations.  
2. Non-adherence to the protocol and/or Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines  
Strict adherence  to the protocol and GCP guidelines will be expected of every participating 
medical center and monitored by [CONTACT_1363], the Executive Committee, and the Study Group. Documentation of protocol violations will be required.  Medical centers with repeated protocol violations or repeated failures to follow GCP Guidelines will be recommended for termination to the DMC, the CSPCC Director, and the Director of VA CSR&D. If a participating investigator feels that adherence to the protocol may result in an apparent immediate hazard to the participant, the interest of the participant must take precedence.  
Protocol violations must be reported to the CSPCC on the appropriate case report form and to the Central IRB to ensure immediate hazard to the participant did not occur.   
By [CONTACT_115519], the medical center delegates responsibility for global 
monitoring of the ongoing study to the Cooperative Studies Program Committee and personnel 
listed above. However, the Research and Development (R&D) Committee and the VA Central IRB may require the participating investigator to submit annual and final progress reports concerning the status of the study at the medical center for local monitoring purposes.  
 
XIII. ORGANIZATION & ADMINISTRATION  
The organizational and administrative structure of this cooperative study will be similar to others in the Cooperative Studies Program. Specifically, it will include the following components:  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
73 The Cooperative Studies Program  (VA Central Office) establishes  overall policies and 
procedures which are applied to all VA cooperative studies through the Study Chairs’ offices, 
and the Palo Alto CSPCC.  
The Palo Alto CSPCC and the Study Chairs offices  jointly will perform the day -to-day scientific 
and administrative coordination of the study. These include developi[INVESTIGATOR_284113], 
operations manual, and case report forms; ensuring the appropriate support for the participating centers; scheduling meetings and conference calls; answering questions about the protocol; conducting site visits; publishing newsletters; preparing interim and final progress reports; and archiving study data at the end of the study. Interim statistical progress reports will be produced every six months. Participant accrual and data quality will be monitored closely to ensure that the study is progressing satisfactorily.   The PBRN Coordinating Center will assist with advising 
on strategies for recruitment and retention of women, monitoring recruitment and retention of 
women, and conduct ing entry and analysis VFF data.    
The CSP Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center (CSPCRPCC)  provides advice and 
consultation about protocol development, procedure implementation, and participant safety issues. CSPCRPCC is responsible for monitoring and reporting the safety of trial participants through the review, assessment, and communication of adverse events and serious adverse events reported by [CONTACT_284227], Executive Committee, Data Coordinating Center, and CSP Central Office. The reporting activities include the filing of regulatory documents involving adverse events to meet federal regulations and CSP policies. In conjunction with the Data Coordinat ing Center, the CSPCRPCC trends and analyzes safety data in order to prepare 
reports for various committees including the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), VA Central 
Institutional Review Board (CIRB), Study Executive Committee(s), and study investigator 
meetings.  
Each participating VA medical center  will designate a Local Site Investigator ( LSI) to be 
responsible administratively and scientifically for the conduct of the study at the center. LSIs  will 
be expected to attend all annual Study Group meetings, as well as to hire and supervise personnel. By [CONTACT_115519], the medical center delegates responsibility for global monitoring of the ongoing study to the DMC , and the Cooperative Studies Scientific 
Evaluation Committee. However, the Research and Development Committee (R&D) and the Cental IRB may require the participating investigator to submit annual reports concerning the 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
74 status of the study at the medical center for local monitoring purposes.  
The Cooperative Studies Scientific Evaluation Committee (CSSEC)  reviews the scientific merit 
of all new cooperative study proposals and all ongoing cooperative studies as deemed 
necessary. The committee is composed of both VA and non- VA clinical research scientists, 
most of whom have had experience in managing their own cooperative studies.  
The Study Group will be composed of the SIs from each participating center, the Study Chairs, 
and CSP staff (Biostatistician, Project Manager, Clinical Research Pharmacist, and others). The Study Chairs will head the group, which will meet once per year to discuss the progress of the study, any problems that the investigators have encountered, and any suggestions for improving the study.  
The Executive Committee will be concerned with the overall management of the study. It will be 
headed by [CONTACT_284228], study Project Manager, Clinical Research Pharmacist, selected participating investigators, and outside consultants as needed. This committee will meet every month to review study conduct and progress, decide 
upon changes in the study, determine the fate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284114], initiate any sub- protocols, and discuss publication of the study results.  
The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  will provide independent and unbiased reviews of the 
study’s progress and will monitor patient intake, outcomes, adverse events, and other issues related to patient safety. This committee will be composed of two biostatisticians and several physicians with expertise in the subject area(s) of the study. The Study Chairs, study 
Biostatistician, study AE Specialist, and the Director of the CSPCC are ex officio (liaison, non-
voting) members of the committee. The DMC  will meet every 6 months to monitor the study . Its 
primary responsibility is to review the progress of the study and to decide whether or not the 
study should continue. To help them make their assessment, the Study Chairs and Study 
Biostatistician will furnish the DMC  with appropriate monitoring data before each meeting.  
The Palo Alto CSPCC Human Rights Committee (HRC) , composed primarily of lay people, may 
be called upon to review new protocols, periodically make site visits to participating centers to monitor participant involvement in the study, and review and consult on any ethical and human rights issues that arise during the conduct of the study. Prior to participation, each site's local R&D and the VA Central IRB (CIRB) must also review and approve its involvement in the study.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
75 The CSP Site Mo nitoring, Auditing and Resource Team (SMART), located at the CSP Clinical 
Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center (CSPCRPCC) in Albuquerque, NM will monitor the 
trial for compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP). GCP reviewers from SMART will visit participating sites shortly after enrollment is initiated to monitor investigator regulatory 
compliance, protocol adherence, and overall research practices. In addition to the regularly 
scheduled GCP review visits, an independent comprehensive GCP site audit may be conducted 
at any time at the request of CSP study management.  
 
  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, 2018 
76 XIV. GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE (GCP)  
A. Role of GCP  
This trial will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations.  
The intent of these regulations is to safeguard subjects’ welfare and assure the validity 
of data resulting from the clinical research. The VA Cooperative Studies Pr ogram will 
assist Local Site Investigators (LSIs) in complying with GCP requirements through its Site Monitoring, Auditing and Resource Team (SMART) based in Albuquerque, NM.  
SMART serves as the Quality Assurance arm of CSP for GCP compliance.  Study site 
personnel will receive GCP training at the study organizational meeting.  SMART will 
provide training, manuals and materials to assist study personnel in organizing study 
files and will be available throughout the trial to advise and assist LSIs regarding  GCP 
issues.  
B. Summary of Monitoring and Auditing Plans  
1. Monitoring Visits  
• Initiation visits at each site soon after study start -up 
• Additional monitoring visits may be conducted as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_284229].  
2. Audits   
• Routine audits – independent site visits to one or more sites per year as determined by 
[CONTACT_69586].  
• For-Cause audits –independent audit of a site as requested by [CONTACT_284230].   
• Audits may be scheduled or unannounced.  
  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_347025] possible biases affecting the data collection.  
All presentations and publications from this study will be done in accordance with the CSP policy as stated in the CSP Guidelines. The presentation or publication of any data collected by [CONTACT_284231]'s Executive Committee. This is true whether the publication or presentation is concerned with the results of the principal undertaking or is associated with the study in some other way.  No individual participating investigator is permitted to perform analyses or interpretations or to make public presentations or seek publication of any of the data other than under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_284115].  
The Executive Committee has the authority to establish one or more publication committees, 
usually made up of subgroups of participating investigators and some members of the Executive 
Committee, for the purpose of producing manuscripts for presentation and publication. All presentations and publications will be circulated to all participating investigators for their review, comments, and suggestions, at least four weeks prior to submission of the manuscript to the presenting or publication body.  
Authorship should include the Study Chair s, the National Study  Coordinator, members of the 
Executive Committee, and Participating Investigators from top recruiting centers. The number of authors will not exceed individual journal limitations. All publications must give proper recognition to the Study's funding source. If an investigator's major salary support and/or 
commitment are from the VA, the investigator must list the VA as his/her primary institutional 
affiliation. Submission of manuscripts or abstracts must follow the usual VA policy. Ideally, a subtitle is used stating, "A VA Cooperative Study." A copy of the letter to the editor and the manuscript/abstract submitted for publication/presentation should be sent to the CSP Director, and for information purposes, to the members of the study's DMC. The CSP also requires that a copy of every manuscript must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_276704] a last quality control step.  
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_347026] of proposed manuscripts for CSP #591:  
1. Comparative  Effectiveness of Prolonged Exposure and Cognitive Processing Therapy for 
the Treatment of PTSD  
This manuscript will present findings pertaining to the primary and secondary objectives of the 
study: (1) to compare the effectiveness of Prolonged Exposure and Cognitive Processing 
Therapy for reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms; and (2) to compare the effectiveness of Prolonged Exposure and Cognitive Processing Therapy for reducing the severity of comorbid mental health problems and service utilization and improving functioning and quality of life.  
2. Effect of Participant Preferences for Treatment on Response to Prolonged Exposure and Cognitive Processing Therapy for PTSD 
This manuscript will describe sociodemographic and clinical factors related to preference for Prolonged Exposure versus Cognitive Processing Therapy and will examine whether receiving preferred treatment affects treatment outcome.  
3. Predictors of Clinical Outcome in Cognitive- Behavioral Therapy for PTSD

INTRODUCTION  
You are being invited to take part in a research study that is funded by [CONTACT_284236].  Before you decide to take part, it is  important for you to know why 
the research is being done and what it will involve.  This includes any potential risks to you, as well as any potential benefits you might receive.     
Read the information below c arefully , and discuss it with family and friends if you wish.  
Ask one of the study staff if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more details.  Take your time to decide.  If you do decide to take part, your signature [CONTACT_284256], and that you were able to discuss any questions and concerns you had with a member of the study team.   
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE  
WHY IS THIS RESEARCH BEING DONE ? 
The purpose of this research study is to compare two types of individual therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284119] s Disorder (PTSD). One of the treatments is 
Prolonged Exposure (PE) and the other is  Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) . Both 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284120] . However, the two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284121] .  
PE involves learning a method of dealing with  traumatic memories and  stressful 
situations to help you overcome the distress in a safe manner. The other treatment , 
CPT, looks at  the impact the traumatic event has had on your life and helps you to 
examine and change your unhelpful thoughts and feelings related to the event, yourself, others and the world. The purpose of this research study  is to c ompare the 
effectiveness  of these two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284122], along with related symptoms 
such as depression and anxiety, to see which treatment is better . The study will also try 
to determine if there are people who respond better to one treatment  or the other.

CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_347030] YOU BEEN ASKED TO TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY ? 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are over [ADDRESS_347031] had a 
trauma experience such as combat,  sexual abuse, physical  abuse, or natural disasters.  
WHO IS CONDUCTING THE RESEARCH STUDY ?  
This study is sponsored by [CONTACT_284237] A ffairs .  The study is directed by 
[CONTACT_284238] P. Schnurr  PhD, a researcher at the White River Junction  VA Medical Center .  
Co-directors are Kathleen M. Chard, PhD at the Cincinnati VA Medical Center and Josef 
Ruzek, PhD at the Palo Alto VA. They are assisted by [CONTACT_284239], the Palo Alto  VA Cooperative Studies Program Coordinating Center 
(CSPCC) , the [LOCATION_011] VA Medical Center , and your local VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE RESEARCH STUDY ?  
The CERV -PTSD study team at your medical center will ask  Veterans like you to 
provide consent to participate in this research study. Study participation involves two 
parts. The first part is to go through screening procedures that will determine if you are eligible to receive PTSD therapy (PE or CPT) as part of the study . The second part o f 
study participation is randomization to either PE or CPT treatment (“randomization” is described below in “Study Procedures”) and post -treatment follow -up. Not everybody 
who signs a consent form and goes through screening will qualify and receive P TSD 
therapy . We expect that  approximately half of the participants will be eligible to receive 
study treatment . Up to [ADDRESS_347032] four years, but you will be in the research study for approximately one 
year.

STUDY PROCEDURES  
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH STUDY ?   
On your first visit you will be asked some questions to find out if you might be eligible for 
the study. The questions include background  information  and questions about your 
current mood and how you are copi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  If it seems you are eligible for the study, you will 
fill out some additional paper -and-pencil questionnaires about PTSD, depression, 
anger, health and general well -being.    
 After this visit  an assessor located in [LOCATION_011] or Long Beach  will contact  [CONTACT_284240] a clinical interview designed to determine if you have PTSD  and other 
related symptoms. You also will be asked about your preferences for treatment, but this 
will not affect which treatment you receive.  You do not need to return to the VA for this 
interview. However, if you do not have access to a phone you must agree to come to the local VA clinic for the phone interview.   This phone call interview will take between  
two and four hours  and can be done in two sessions.  After this assessment it will be 
decid ed if you are eligible to participate  in the study.   
To be eligible for  the study you must meet the following criteria:  
• be enrolled in the VA system and referred to the study by a VA staff member,  
• be a Veteran with a current diagnosis of PTSD due to any trauma during your military service,  
• agree to be placed in either treat ment (PE or CPT),  
• agree to not receive other psychotherapy or counseling for PTSD while you are receiving  therapy as part of this study ,  
• agree to let us access your medical record so we can learn about how much you are using VA services before and during  the study,  
• have regular access to a telephone or agree to come into the VA clinic for telephone interviews,

drugs or alcohol . If you are currently suicidal or homicidal with intent and a plan we will 
help you obtain mental health care and you may be eligible for the study at a later time.  
If you are eligible for the study you will be "randomized" into one of the two treatments 
described below. Randomization means that you are put into one treatment or the other  
completely by [CONTACT_3364]. It is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin. If you take part in the study, you will be assigned to either PE or CPT  with a trained therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].  You will have the same therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284123] . Both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284124].  
They both involve 10- [ADDRESS_347034] 90 minutes in PE or 60 minutes in CPT. 
Sessions will be scheduled weekly, although you may attend some sessions more than once a week or skip a week (for a scheduling conflict, for example).  You and your

POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS  
WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS OF THE RESEARCH STUDY ?   
It is possible that during the assessment s  or therapy sessions  you may feel some 
increase in unpleasant emotions  while recalling and describing the traumatic event.  
Because you have PTSD you may have been trying  to block  or avoid thoughts and 
feelings.  The goal of PE and CPT  is to have you feel less stress and other painful 
emotions related to the traumatic event. We expect that any distress you may 
experience will  be temporary. However it is possible that your condition may worsen.  If 
at any time you are feeling overwhelmed or upset you may call the study staff between 
the hours of 8 :00 AM  and 4 :00 PM , come to th e main VA emergency room to be seen  
by a mental health professional , or call the Veterans Crisis Hotline at 1- [PHONE_113].  
If any significant new findings develop during the study that relate to your willingness to continue, you will be informed.  
Risks of  the usual care you receive (PE or CPT therapy for your PTSD)  are not risks of 
the research.  Those risks are not included in this consent form.  You should talk with your health care providers if you have any questions about the risks of usual care.

discontinuing your current treatment, but brief c heck -ins with your current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284130].   
 ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE RESEARCH STUDY ?  
If you agree to take part in this research study, there may not be a direct benefit to you.  The investigators hope the information learned from this research study will benefit you 
and other Veterans  with PTSD in the future. Potential benefits to you may include a  
reduction in your  PTSD  symptoms over the course of therapy. The knowledge gained 
from this study will serve to guide future research and clinical care for Veterans. For 
society in general, this study will provide useful information regarding treatment effectiveness , recovery from trauma, and long -term benefits of therapeutic interventions . 
ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATING IN THIS RESEARCH  
WHAT OTHER CHOICES FOR CARE ARE THERE ?   
PE and CPT are not investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Both of these PTSD treatments have been found to be effective in past studies and they are available to you even if you decide not to participate in this study. This research study will compare the two treatments to one another.  
Instead of being in this research study, you have these options:  
If you have PTSD you may  request PE, CPT, or other types of PTSD treatment  based 
on VA guidelines  and availability at your local VA or Vet Center.  If you do not have 
PTSD you may contact [CONTACT_284245].

Appendix D  - 1 Appendix D . OWNERSHIP, CONTROL AND ACCESS TO STUDY DATA 
A. Ownership and Control  
The CSP will retain all ownership rights to the study data, including original data and any 
derived data generated from the original data.  If the CSP study is being conducted with a 
clinical research agreement with another institution, the terms of that agreement will define any 
alternate conditions for ownership and control of study data.  All study data will reside at the CSPCC/ERIC or on its designated VA Research and Development servers and will not be released until the objectives as stated in the protocol and the primary manuscript (s) identified in 
the protocol publication plan have been completed.  The CSPCC/ERIC will act as the repository of all study data from a completed cooperative study.   
The study Executive Committee has the authority to determine  all uses of the data, provided 
that these uses do not conflict with the study protocol, CSP policies, VA policy or other 
regulations. Potential uses include analyses of the data, publication of the results of analyses, or 
distribution of copi[INVESTIGATOR_284137].  
VA CSP is authorized to share the data for the purposes indicated under the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, 45 CFR 164.512(i) and authorities stated in VHA Handbook 1200.12.  Data may be released to other investigators after the 
planned objectives and primary manuscript (s) are completed and upon approval of the Study 
Chairman, Executive Committee (if it still exists), CSPCC/ERIC Director and Director, CSR&D (see next section). Data use agreements, including assurance that all VA data security policies will be strictly adhered to, will be instituted prior to any data being released.  
B. Release and Sharing of Study Data Sets 
 
While the CSP is the custodian of study data, the CSP does not seek  to limit the use of the data, 
but rather to ensure that these data sets are being appropriately used scientifically and ethically 
and that the rights and welfare of study participants are protected. Local Site investigators  
(LSIs)  are encouraged to submit  proposals to the Executive Committee for use of the data and 
these will be approved if scientifically and ethically sound.  Data sets will not be released before 
the study database is locked and until the objectives as stated in the protocol and the primary manuscript (s) have been completed.  
The Director, CSPCC/ERIC will have the aut hority to release data sets to Local Site 
Investigators/Executive Committee members, who have been given approval for access to 
 
CSP #591, version 11.0, February 16, [ADDRESS_347046] obtain 
approval for release of data by [CONTACT_19305] (if still functioning), the Director, 
CSPCC/ERIC, and the Director, CSR&D.  A ll recipi[INVESTIGATOR_284138] a data use 
agreement that stipulates that the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]:  
• will only use the data for the purposes stated in the data use agreement,  
• will give proper credit to the study and the CSP and VA in all presentations and publications,  
• will not give this data to other investigators without consent of the Directors, 
CSPCC/ERIC and CSR&D,  
• will destroy or return the data when they have completed their work,  
• will not try to identify any study participant, and  
• will consider th e data sets as confidential information and will keep the data sets in a 
secure location.  
 
In addition, sharing of the data with another facility or institution will require evidence of approval 
and any appropriate waivers by [CONTACT_4158]/or Research Committee  and Information Security Officer of that institution.  Sharing of CSP Study data outside of the CSP Study may be limited by [CONTACT_284252].  
The CSPCC/ERIC, for its part, will provide the investigator requesting the data with de- identified 
datasets or aggregate data, making identification of study participants as difficult as possible. 
HIPAA guidelines for de- identified data sets will be used, whenever possible.  Investigators will 
not be provided with full study databases, but rather just with the information that they will need 
to do their research.   The CSPCC/ERIC’s main responsibility is to prepare the needed analyses for the primary manuscript(s) and secondary manuscripts identified in the protocol or planned by [CONTACT_19305].  Secondary analyses by [CONTACT_47125]/ERIC may be delayed until the primary analyses and manuscripts are completed.  Preparation of datasets and developi[INVESTIGATOR_284139] a lower priority than the completion of study analyses planned by [CONTACT_19305].   Alternatively, the CSPCC/ERIC may provide the LSIs  
with appropriate data sets if they have the resources to use these data sets.

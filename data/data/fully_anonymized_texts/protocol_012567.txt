2.  Hydro-alcohol solution based vehicle (Test Article B)  
Study Objective  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of two topi[INVESTIGATOR_543993]. 
Study Design Randomized, evaluator -blinded, bilateral comparison  
Treatment Groups  Eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1) to treatment with Test Art icle A 
to one side of the face versus Test Article B on the contralateral side.  
Duration of Treatment  Once daily for six weeks.  
Duration of Study  Each subject will participate for approximately seven weeks.  
Study Population  Healthy male or female subjec ts 9 years of age or older with a clinical 
diagnosis of symmetric moderate facial acne vulgaris (Grade 3 on the 
Investigator’s Global Assessment [IGA]), ≥16 inflammatory lesions (i.e., 
papules and pustules) on the face, and no more than two active nodules on 
the face. 
Total Number of

1.  Subject is a healthy male or non -pregnant, non -breastfeeding female 
9 years of age or older at the time of consent/assent.  
2.  Subject has provided written informed consent/assent. A subject 
under [ADDRESS_711058] provide written informed assent and be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_85168]/consent signing. The parent or legal guardian must provide 
informed consent for the subject. If a subject becomes [ADDRESS_711059] has a clinical diagnosis of moderate facial acne vulgaris, with 
an identical IGA score (IGA Grade 3) on both the right and left si de

CO N T R O L L ED  &  CO N F I D EN T I AL  count on the right and left side of the face should be similar (defined 
as within ~ 50% of each other based on the side w ith the higher lesion 
count; e.g., if the left side of the face has 17 lesions, then 50% of 17 
is 8.5, rounding up to nine (9) lesions; this means that the right side 
can have as few as eight lesions [17 minus 9]) and have a minimum 
of eight lesions on eac h side. 
5.  Subject and parent/guardian (if applicable) are willing and able to 
apply the test article(s) as directed, comply with study instructions,

free of any disease state or phy sical condition that might impair 
evaluation of facial acne vulgaris or otherwise impact the integrity of 
the study, or exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by [CONTACT_160823].  
8.  Females must be surgically sterile1 or use an effective method of bi rth 
control.2,3 Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a 
negative urine pregnancy test (UPT)4 at Visit 1/Baseline.

Study Procedures  NOTE: Clinical evaluations (Right and Left Facial IGA and lesion 
counts) will be performed by a Blinded Evaluator who is not involved in 
randomization, test article application instructions, or documentation of 
test article compliance. The same Blinded Eva luator should evaluate a 
subject over the course of the study.  
 
Subjects can be screened for the study up to 45 days before Baseline. During 
screening, the study requirements will be reviewed, written informed 
consent/assent obtained, and eligibility confirmed. These procedures may be 
combined with the Baseline Visit i f wash out from prohibited medications is 
not required. If applicable, qualified subjects can wash out from prohibited 
acne medications or treatments prior to their Baseline Visit once they have 
been consented/assented. Subjects who require washout for lon ger than 45 
days will be re -consented/assented.  
 
The study will consist of a Screening/Baseline Visit and follow -up visits at 
Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. An unscheduled in -office visit may be done at the 
discretion of the investigator for subjects with toler ability issues or a material 
adverse event (AE) concern.  
 
Visit 1 (Day  1): Screening/Baseline.  The study requirements and procedures 
will be reviewed and written informed consent /assent must be obtained prior 
to the initiation of any study -related procedur es. Demographics, inclusion/ 
exclusion (I/E) criteria, medical history, and concomitant medications and 
procedures/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_543999]. Subjects that 
require a “washout” period prior to enrollment into the study to meet I/E 
criteria requirements will be required to return to the clinic within 45 days to 
complete the remaining activities. Subjects who require “washout” for 
longer than 45 days will be re -consented. The following procedures will be 
performed on Day 1: confirmati on of eligibility, demographics, medical 
history, review of concomitant medications and procedures/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
dermatologic exam, a UPT for WOCBP, clinical evaluations (Right and Left 
Facial IGA and lesion counts) by a Blinded Evaluator, Right and Left Faci al 
LSR assessment, and standardized photography of the face. Note: subjects 
must have identical IGA scores (IGA Grade 3) on both the Right and 
Left side of the face at Baseline with similar lesion counts (defined as 
within ~ 50% of each other and a minimum  of eight lesions on each side).  
Prior to test article application, transepi[INVESTIGATOR_7044] (TEWL) and 
sebum assessment will be performed as defined in a separate procedure

article on the contralateral side. Test article application will be demonstrated 
by [CONTACT_544022]. Test article(s) will be 
dispensed along with application instructions, and a Subject Diary will be 
provided to document applied or missed doses. Subjects will apply the first 
doses of the test article in the clinic under staff supervision to ensure proper 
application. Subjects will be instructed to apply the test article once daily in 
the evening for six weeks. LSRs will be assessed [ADDRESS_711063] 
article application. AEs will be documented; AEs on the face will be 
segmented by [CONTACT_544023], if applicable. The subject will be scheduled fo r 
their next follow -up visit. 
 
Visit 2 (Week 1): Follow -up 1, Visit 3 (Week 2): Follow -up 2, and Visit 4 
(Week 4): Follow -Up 3. The subject will return to the clinic for review of 
concomitant medications and procedures/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Clinical evaluations 
(IGA and lesion counts for the Right and Left side of the face) will be 
performed by a Blinded Evaluator. LSRs will be assessed for the Right and 
Left side of the face. Visit 3 and Visit 4 only: standardized photographs 
will be taken. TEWL and sebum assessment will be performed as 
defined in a separate procedure manual on the Right and Left side of 
the face. The Subject Diary will be reviewed/collected/distributed as 
necessary and test article will be returned/weighed and compliance (Right vs 
Left) will be revie wed; the site staff will remind the subject to continue to 
apply test article daily (once in the evening) until the next clinic visit and to 
not apply test article or other products (including make -up and using a 
cleanser) to the face within four hours of the next clinic visit. Test article 
application will be demonstrated at each clinic visit –  emphasizing the 
importance to properly apply the test articles to the correct side of the face. 
Additional test article will be dispensed as needed. AEs will be doc umented; 
AEs on the face will be segmented by [CONTACT_544023], if applicable. The subject 
will be scheduled for the next visit.  
 
Visit 5 (Week 6): End of Treatment (EOT). The subject will return to the 
clinic for review of concomitant medications and procedu res/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. A 
UPT for WOCBP will be performed as applicable. Clinical evaluations (IGA 
and lesion counts for the Right and Left side of the face) will be performed 
by a Blinded Evaluator. LSRs will be assessed for the Right and Left side of 
the face. St andardized photos will be taken. TEWL and sebum assessment 
will be performed as defined in a separate procedure manual on the Right 
and Left side of the face. Test article accountability will be documented; all 
test articles and subject diaries will be collected. AEs will be documented; 
AEs on the face will be segmented by [CONTACT_544023], if applicable. The subject 
will be scheduled for the next visit.

CO N T R O L L ED  &  CO N F I D EN T I AL  ongoing treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) at the EOT visit (Visit 5) will also 
be evaluated. The subj ect will exit the study.  
 
Unscheduled Visit.  The investigator may see the subject at an unscheduled 
visit to manage any AEs or LSRs (if applicable). The subject will return to 
the clinic for review of concomitant medications and procedures/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
LSRs, and AEs. Test article accountability will be documented. The Subject 
Diary and test article compliance will be reviewed. All assessments will take 
into account potential differences between the Right and Left side of the face. 
The subject’s next appointm ent will be confirmed.  
Study Measurements  
 Dosing Compliance:  
Measures of test article compliance will include the duration (days) of 
treatment (defined as last dose date 
–
 first dose date +1), the total number of 
applications applied and missed (determined from the doses reported in the 
Subject Diary), and the percent of expected doses applied . A subject will be 
considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the subject applies at least 
 and no more than  of the expected test article appl
ications for the 
specified duration of the study for all Test Articles and does not miss the 
scheduled applications for more than three consecutive days.  
 
Efficacy and safety measurements will be assessed according to the schedule 
of events. 
 
Efficacy: 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (Right and Left Face)  
Overall severity of acne will be assessed using a five -point scale where 
0=Clear, 1=Almost Clear, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, and 4=Severe. This is a 
static morphological scale that refers to a point in time and 
not a comparison 
to Baseline.  
 
Acne Lesion Counts (Right and Left Face)  
The number of non 
-
inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) and 
inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) on the face (including those 
present on the nose) will be counted. Co unts of nodules and cysts will be 
reported separately and are not to be included in the inflammatory or non 
-
inflammatory lesion counts.  
 
VISIA (Right and Left Face)  
Digital photographs will be taken of the face with the VISIA (Canfield 
Scientific) to docum ent the progress of the subject (right vs left sides) in the 
study at Visit 1/Baseline, Visit 3, Visit 4, and Visit 5/EOT. At the election 
of the Sponsor, they may choose to perform an independent separate analysis 
of the photographs for clinical changes r elative to Baseline.  
 
Bioinstrumentation Assessments (Right and Left Face)  
TEWL and sebum measurements will be taken as specified per protocol.

CO N T R O L L ED  &  CO N F I D EN T I AL  All reported or observed AEs will be recorded. At each visit, subjects will 
also be questioned specifically about the status of any ongoing AEs. 
Untoward events that occur prior to the first dose of test article will be 
captured in the Medical History section of the case report form (CRF) unless 
they are related to a study -specific procedure.  
 
Local Skin Reactions (Right and Left Face)  
At each visit, LSRs (erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, burning/stinging, 
pruritus, erosion, and pain) will be assessed. Erythema, edema, 
scaling/dryness, and erosion will be assessed by [CONTACT_544024]/stinging, pain, and pruritus will be assessed by [CONTACT_423]. 
Assessments will be made using a 4 -point ordinal scale where 0=absent, 
1=mild (slight, barely perceptible), 2=modera te (distinct presence), and 
3=severe (marked, intense). Only LSRs that require medical intervention 
(e.g., prescription medication), require withholding or discontinuation of the 
application of the test article, or extend 2  cm beyond the Treatment Area wil l 
be documented as AEs. Any LSRs that are not listed above will be recorded 
as an AE. 
 
Urine Pregnancy Tests  
A UPT will be performed at Visit 1/Baseline and at Visit 5/Week 6/EOT for 
WOCBP. 
Study Endpoints

were used to establish the sizing of this study.  
Statistical Methods  All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® Version 9.4 unless 
otherwise stated.  
 
Study Populations: 
The Safety population will include all randomized subjects who received test 
article and applied at least one application.  
 
The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population will include all randomized 
subjects who met all I/E criteria, applied at least one dose of test article, and 
returned for at least one post -Baseline evaluation visit.  
 
The per-protocol (PP) population will i nclude all randomized subjects who met 
all mITT population criteria, 
were compliant with the assigned test articles 
based on the subject diaries  (applied at least  and no more than  of 
the expected test article applications for the specified duratio n of the study), 
did not miss the scheduled test article applications for more than three 
consecutive days (i.e., three consecutive days with no test article application), 
have no other evidence of material dosing noncompliance,  and completed the 
primary endpoint evaluation at Week 6 within the designated visit window (±3 
days) with no significant protocol violations and 
prohibited medications
 that 
would affect the treatment evaluation.  
 
Dosing Compliance : 
As appropriate, outcomes relative to Test Article A vs Test Article B will be 
tabulated. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize test article 
compliance for each analysis population. Compliant subjects are defined as 
those who apply at least  and no more than  of the expected test 
article applications (Right and Left face), and did not miss scheduled 
applications for more than three consecutive days. The percentage of 
compliant subjects will also be presented.  
 
Efficacy Analyses:

CO N T R O L L ED  &  CO N F I D EN T I AL  1. BACKGROUND  
Acne vulgaris is a common disease of both males and females, usually manifesting initially 
during adolescence. The primary pathologic events are initiated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_544003], 
especially of sebaceous -gland-bearing areas of the face, chest, and back as a resu lt of 
increased androgen stimulation initiated at adrenarche or puberty. As a result of both 
abnormal keratinization of the infra -infundibular portion of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_544004], a blockage of the duct results i n the unapparent 
clinical lesion of the microcomedone. Continued blockage, colonization of the follicle by 
[CONTACT_76520][INVESTIGATOR_76494] , and generation of multiple chemoattractant and 
proinflammatory moieties may result in non -inflammatory clinical lesions, com edones, 
and inflammatory lesions: papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts [ 1]. 
 
FMX101 4% is a minocycline containing topi[INVESTIGATOR_76495] a treatment for 
acne vulgaris. Foamix has conducted three Phase 3 studies (FX2014-04; FX2014- 05, and 
FX2017-22) to assess the safety and tolerability of FMX101 4%, which contains 
minocycline and the vehicle being studied. The treatment has been shown to be effective 
and well-tolerated. This Phase 4, Proof of Principle study (FX2018- 23) will further 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of FMX101 hydrophobic oil based vehicle compared to a 
hydro-alcohol solution based vehicle for the treatment of moderate facial acne vulgaris.  
2. RATIONALE  
FMX101 vehicle is an oil -based formulation that may have a role in the effectiveness and 
tolerance of the FMX101 4% minocycline acne treatment. This Proof of Principle trial will 
study two formulations: the FMX101 vehicle versus a topi[INVESTIGATOR_544005] -alcohol formulation, 
for safety and efficacy in the treatment of acne vulgaris.  
3. OBJECTIVE 
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the two topi[INVESTIGATOR_544006]. More specifically, the above formulations will be 
compared for their effect on facial sebum.  
4. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a randomized, evaluator -blinded, bilateral comparison study of FMX101 
hydrophobic oil based vehicle (Test Article A) and hydro -alcohol solution based vehicle 
(Test Article B) in healthy male or female subjects [ADDRESS_711075] a clinical diagnosis of symmetric moderate facial acne 
vulgaris (Grade 3 on the Investigator’s Global Assessment [IGA]) and ≥16 inflammatory 
lesions (i.e., pa pules and pustules) on the face. Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled 
to obtain about 10 evaluable subjects at one to two study sites. Subjects will be randomized 
(1:1) to treatment with Test Article A to one side of the face versus Test Article B on  the 
contralateral side.

Subjects will be instructed to apply the assigned test articles once daily in the evening for 
six weeks to the app ropriate sides of the face. The study will consist of a 
Screening/Baseline Visit, Visits at Week 1, Week 2, and Week 4, along with a Week 6/End 
of Treatment (EOT) Visit, and a Week 7/End of Study (EOS) Visit. An unscheduled in-
office visit may be completed  at the discretion of the investigator for subjects with 
tolerability issues or a material adverse event (AE) concern. Efficacy measurements will 
include IGA, lesion counts, Transepi[INVESTIGATOR_7024] (TEWL) and sebum 
measurements, and VISIA photographs. Sa fety measurements will include assessments of 
local skin reactions (LSRs), documentation of AEs, and a urine pregnancy test (UPT) for 
women of child- bearing potential (WOCBP).

the side with the higher lesion count; e.g., if the left side of the face has 17 lesions, 
then 50% of 17 is 8.5, r ounding up to nine (9) lesions; this means that the right side 
can have as few as eight lesions [17 minus 9]) and have a minimum of eight lesions 
on each side.

10. CLINICAL EVALUATIONS  
The following clinical evaluations will be performed according to the schedules indicated 
during the study. The same investigator should complete the evaluations for a given subject 
throughout the study. If this becomes impossible a sub- investigator with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_229763].  
 
Clinical evaluations (Right and Left Facial IGA and lesion counts) will be performed 
by a Blinded Evaluator who is not involved in randomization, test article application 
instructions, or documentation of test ar ticle compliance. The same Blinded 
Evaluator should evaluate a subject over the course of the study. The study staff, the 
Unblinded Evaluator, and subjects will also be instructed not to discuss the treatment, 
AEs, SAEs, or any study experiences with the B linded Evaluator.  
 
The Blinded Evaluator will only have access to the page in the CRF required to 
document the Right and Left Facial IGA and lesion counts; all other CRF content will 
be inaccessible.  
10.1 Investigator’s Global Assessment  
The IGA score is a static evaluation of the overall severity or “average” degree of severity 
of a subject’s disease by [CONTACT_544032], taking into account all of the subject’s 
facial acne lesions as the subject appears on the day of the evaluation. The investigator 
should NOT refer to any other assessments to assist with this evaluation and should 
complete the IGA score prior to performing lesion counts . This evaluation is NOT a 
comparison with the IGA at any other visit or a mathematical calculation  based on counts 
of individual lesion types. Overall severity of acne will be assessed using a five -point scale 
from 0=Clear to 4=Severe.  Subjects must have an identical IGA score of moderate severity 
(IGA Grade 3) on both the right and left side of the fa ce at Baseline.

Grade Description 
0 Clear; Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris  
[ADDRESS_711091] clear; Rare non-inflammatory lesions may be present, with rare non -
inflamed papules (papules must be resolving and may be hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_49194], 
though not pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]- red) 
2 Mild; Some non-inflammatory lesions are present, with few inflammatory 
lesions (papules/pustules only; no nodulocystic lesions)  
3 Moderate; Many non-inflammatory lesions. Multiple inflammatory lesions 
evident with several to many papules/pu stules, and there may be one small 
nodulocystic lesion  
4 Severe; Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones and 
papules/pustules, there may be a few nodulocystic lesions  
10.2 Acne Lesion Counts  
The number of non -inflammatory lesions (open and clos ed comedones), inflammatory 
lesions (papules and pustules), and nodulocystic lesions (nodules and cysts) on the face 
(including those present on the nose) will be counted by [CONTACT_544032]. Subjects 
must have a minimum of 16 inflammatory lesions AND  ≤ 2 nodulocystic lesions on the 
face in total (with no more than one nodule/cyst per the right or left side of the face) at 
Visit 1/Baseline.  
 
At Visit 1/Baseline, the inflammatory lesion count on the right and left side of the face 
should be similar (de fined as within ~ 50% of each other). For example, if the left side of 
the face has 17 lesions, then 50% of 17 is 8.5, rounding up to nine (9) lesions; this means 
that the right side can have as few as eight lesions (17 minus 9). Subjects must have a 
minimum of eight lesions on each side.  
 
The entire face, vertically from the hairline to mandible rim and horizontally from ear to 
ear (not including any lesions on or in the ear), including the nose, will be examined. 
Lesions will be counted separately for the  right and left side of the subject’s face. Lesions 
are defined as follows:  
 
Non-inflammatory lesions:  
• Comedones: open (blackheads) and closed (whiteheads).  
 
Inflammatory lesions:  
• Papules: raised inflammatory lesions with no visible purulent material.  
• Pustules: raised inflammatory lesions with visible purulent material.

• Nodules and cysts: any circumscribed, inflammatory masses greater or equal to 
5 mm in diameter with or without cystic changes.  
10.3 VISIA Photography 
Digital photographs will be taken of the face with the VISIA (Canfield Scientific) to 
document the progress of the subject (right vs left sides) in the study at Visit 1/Baseline, 
Visit 3, Visit 4, and Visit 5/EOT. At the election of the Sponsor, they may choose to 
perform an independent separate analysis of the photographs for clinical changes relative 
to Baseline.  
 
The investigator may also elect to photograph the subject to document AEs or other 
findings at any time during the study as they deem appropriate.  
10.[ADDRESS_711092] article will be captured in  the Medical History section of the 
CRF unless they are related to a study -specific procedure. AEs in the face will be 
segmented to the right and/or left sides of the face. See Section  14 for details on Adverse 
Event Reporting.  
10.5.2  Local Skin Reactions  
At each visit, LSRs (erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, burning/stinging, pruritus, erosion, 
and pain) will be assessed. Erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, and erosion will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_544033]/stinging, pain, and pruritus will be assessed by [CONTACT_423]. 
Assessments will be made using a 4- point ordinal scale where 0=absent, 1=mild (slight, 
barely perceptible), 2=moderate (distinct presence), and 3=severe (marked, intense). Only 
LSRs that require medical intervention (e.g., prescription medication), require withholding 
or discontinuation of the application of the test article, or extend 2  cm beyond the 
Treatment Area will be documented as AEs. LSRs will be segmented to the right and/or 
left sides of the face. Any LSR that are not listed above will be recorded as an AE.

11. PHOTOGRAPHY  
Photography documentation is required in this study so to participate in the study subjects 
must consent to photographs. Photographs taken as part of this study will be used to 
document the subject’s baseline disease, AEs, or other findings during the study. The site 
will be provided with suggested guidelines to assist them in taking standardized 
photographs using the VISIA Camera sy stem at Baseline. All photographs taken as part of 
this study are for informational purposes only and are not to assist in grading or for any 
other assessment. Photographs will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_544018]/grader traini ng needs, but no formal assessments will be performed. However, 
the Sponsor reserves the right to have these photos evaluated using a separate independent 
grader evaluation at its discretion.  
 
Note: Subjects who decline to have photographs taken during the  conduct of study may 
continue to participate in the study. If a subject initially consents to photographs, then 
declines further photography as/if required, the Sponsor may use the photographs taken 
under consent for the purposes noted above. 
 
Additional details regarding photographic methods, uploading and labeling photos, etc. 
will be provided in a Photo Manual to the site.  
 
Photographic equipment will be provided by [CONTACT_1034]/Contract Research Organization 
(CRO) or the site may use its own photographic equipment if approved by [CONTACT_544034].  
12. LABORATORY TESTS  
12.1 Urine Pregnancy Tests  
The UPTs will be performed at the study site, if the site is registered and conforms to CLIA 
regulations for such testing (possesses a current valid CLIA Certificate of  Waiver), or at 
an appropriately registered reference laboratory. The investigator will report the UPT 
results on the CRFs, in the subject’s medical records, and in independent records 
maintained at the study site. The UPT used must have a minimum sensitiv ity of 25 mIU of 
β-hCG/mL.

CO N T R O L L ED  &  CO N F I D EN T I AL  13. END OF STUDY CRITERI A 
At the end of each subject’s participation in the study, the investigator will complete an 
End of Study form for all completed and discontinued subjects.  
13.[ADDRESS_711093] may be withdrawn from the study prior to completion for any of the following 
reasons: 
• AEs 
• Death 
• Lack of efficacy 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Non-compliance with study drug  
• Physician decision  
• Pregnancy 
• Progressive disease  
• Protocol deviation  
• Study terminated by [CONTACT_2728]  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130]; NOTE: if the subject decides to withdraw from the study 
due to an AE then it sho uld be classified as withdrawal due to an AE  
• Other (e.g., any reason that may affect the outcome of the study or safety of 
subjects) 
 
If a subject withdraws from the study prematurely for any reason, the site should make 
every effort to have the subject return to the clinic to perform all of the required visit 
activities and to collect and reconcile all test articles (if applicable). If the subject will not 
return to the clinic, the site should make every attempt to contact [CONTACT_423]; otherwise the 
subject will be considered lost to follow -up. 
 
When a subject is withdrawn from the study for a test article related AE (as defined in 
Section 14.2), when possible, the subject should be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the AE. If the subject is discontinued from the study due to pregnancy, the 
pregnancy and its outcome should be followed.  
 
Subjects who are prematurely withdrawn or disconti nued from the study will not be 
replaced.

humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of 
the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with any drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
 
A suspected adverse re action is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the event. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  
 
An adverse reaction  is any AE caused by a drug. Adv erse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any AE  caused by a drug. For the purposes of 
prescription drug labeling, the term adverse reaction means an undesirable effect, 
reasonably associated with the use of a drug that may occur as part of its pharmacological 
action or may be unpredictable in its occur rence.  
 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Investigator Brochure (IB) or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; or, if an IB is not required or available, the event is co nsidered “unexpected” if 
it is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan 
or elsewhere in the current application. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis 
would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_544035]) if the IB referred only to elevated 
hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis

CO N T R O L L ED  &  CO N F I D EN T I AL  would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the IB listed only cerebral vascular 
accidents. "Unexpected," as  used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as 
occurring w ith the particular drug under investigation.  
 
Timely and complete reporting of all AEs assists the Sponsor and/or their designee (e.g., 
Therapeutics, Inc. [TI]) in identifying any untoward medical occurrence, thereby [CONTACT_17155]:  
1)  protection of the safety of study subjects;  
2)  a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the test article;  
3)  recognition of dose -related test article toxicity;

5)  improvements in study design or procedures; and  
6)  adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements.

article or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their participation in the  
study should receive follow -up as appropriate. AEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization (if possible) and, if they become serious, reported as SAEs (see Section 14.3). 
If possible, the outcome of any AEs that caused permanent discontinuation or that were 
present at the end of the study, especially those considered by [CONTACT_544036], should be reported . 
 
Information on the medical condition of subjects should begin following the subject’s 
written informed consent/assent (if applicable) to participate in the study and a medical 
history should be taken at screening. During any wash out and baseline periods, any 
changes in the health of subjects should be recorded as changes in medical history unless 
an event occurred as a result of a study -related procedure and is unanticipated; in such 
cases, the event should be recorded as an AE and reported to the Insti tutional Review Board 
(IRB) as an “unanticipated problem” in accordance with local procedures. Other changes 
in subject health information becomes AE data when the subject begins dosing with the 
test article; therefore AE data should be collected from the date of the first dose of test 
article until the date of the final study visit. These data are considered TEAEs.  
 
The investigator will instruct the subject to report any AEs that may occur during the study. 
At each visit, the investigator should ask the subject, in non- directive fashion, about any 
change in the subject’s overall health status since the previous visit.

CO N T R O L L ED  &  CO N F I D EN T I AL  The severity of each AE, as judged by [CONTACT_093], will be recorded on the appropriate 
AE CRF and will be graded according to the fol lowing scale:  
 
Mild - The AE is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living.  
 
Moderate - The AE is usually alleviated with additional spe cific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort, but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant. 
 
Severe - The AE interrupts usual activities of daily living or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
 
The investigator must determine the relationship of the AE to the test article according to 
the following categories:  
 
Definitely Related  - An event that follows a r easonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern 
to the test article; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_28214], and reappearance of the event on repeated e xposure (re-challenge). 
 
Probably Related  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern 
to the test article; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_28215]; and that is unlikely to have been caused by 
[CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness or other drugs, procedures, or other causes.  
 
Possibly Related  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administratio n of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern 
to the test article; but may have been caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, other 
drug, procedure, or other causes.  
 
Unlikely Related - An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administration of the test article; that does not follow a known or expected 
response pattern to the test article, or most likely was caused by 
[CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes, because of 
their known effects.  
 
Not Related  - An event almost certainly caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, 
other drug, procedure, or other causes.

categories: 
 
Fatal - Termination of life as a result of an AE.  
 
Not Recovered/Not Resolved - AE has not improved or the subject has not

and requires expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements.  
 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the o pi[INVESTIGATOR_538675], it results in any of the following outcomes : 
• Death; the event must be the cause of death for the SAE to meet this serious 
criterion. 
• Life-threatening event; an event in which the subject was at risk of death at  the time 
of the event and not an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it had 
been more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (for 
≥24 hours). 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substant ial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events; a medical event(s) that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

CO N T R O L L ED  &  CO N F I D EN T I AL  Events NOT considered to be SAEs are:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28217], which was elective or pre- planned, of a pre -
existing condition that did not worsen; and  
• Treatment on an emergency, outpatient  basis, for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of “serious” given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
 
AEs classified as “serious” by [CONTACT_544037] w ith regulatory requirements. All SAEs, whether 
related or unrelated to test article, must be immediately reported by [CONTACT_544038], in the event that he/she is unavailable, to the Project Manager 
listed on the first page of the proto col. Written notification of all SAEs should be sent to 
the Project Manager by [CONTACT_28263]. These include those 
SAEs listed in the protocol or IB and must include an assessment of whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that  the test article caused the event.  
 
Any suspected adverse reactions that are serious and unexpected represent especially 
important safety information that must be reported more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_28218]; 
therefore, it is important that the Investigator submit any information requested by [CONTACT_12066] (e.g., TI) as soon as it becomes available.  
 
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. Should the 
investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of it s relationship to test article) that 
occurs within [ADDRESS_711097] be reported in 
accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. In the event of death, if an autopsy 
is performed, a copy of the report should be  sent to TI, if available.  
 
As required, the Sponsor or designee (e.g., TI) will notify participating investigators of all 
suspected adverse reactions that are serious and unexpected. This notification will be in the 
form of an IND safety report of potenti al serious risks as soon as possible but no later than 
15 calendar days after the Sponsor determines that the information is “reportable” 
according to the criteria listed in 21 CFR Section 312.32. These are:  
 
i) Serious and unexpected suspected adverse rea ctions; 
ii) Findings from other studies including epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], pooled 
analyses, or other clinical studies that suggest a significant risk in humans 
exposed to the test articles;  
iii)  Findings from animal or in vitro tests that suggest a significant risk to 
humans exposed to the test articles, or reports of significant organ toxicity 
at or near the expected human exposure; and  
iv)  Clinically important increases in the rate of occurrence of serious suspected 
adverse reactions.  
 
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the IB  
and promptly submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB according to local

applicable) req uires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB procedures 
for reporting any other safety information. Where required, submission of safety updates 
by [CONTACT_428].  
 
The Sponsor or designee may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities 
(e.g., [LOCATION_002] FDA) within seven calendar days of being notified about the event; 
therefore, it is important that investigators submit any information requeste d by [CONTACT_538695].  
14.[ADDRESS_711098] Abnormalities  
There are no specific laboratory tests, other than a UPT, required in this study.  
14.5 Pregnancy 
WOCBP (see Schedule of Events  for definition of WOCBP) must have a UPT prior to 
study enrollment. Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance 
of avoiding pregnancy during the study and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy. The subject must s ign an informed consent/assent (if applicable) form 
documenting this discussion.  
 
WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_119112] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period). If a subject or investigato r 
suspects that a subject may be pregnant at any time during the study, the test article must 
be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is 
confirmed, the subject must not receive or apply further test article  and must be 
discontinued from the study unless the Sponsor or the Medical Monitor elects to keep the 
subject in the study for safety follow -up purposes. 
 
If following initiation of study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a subject was 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of test article exposure, the investigator 
must immediately notify the Medical Monitor of this event and record the pregnancy on 
the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form. The form will be sent to TI. The investigat or 
must notify the IRB of any pregnancy associated with the study treatment and keep careful 
source documentation of the event.  
 
Protocol-required procedures for those subjects that are discontinued from the study must 
be performed on the subject unless co ntraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (e.g., x -ray studies). 
Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated, 
including counseling of the subject by [CONTACT_538696] (e.g., obstetri cian). In addition, the investigator must report to TI, on 
the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form(s), any follow -up information regarding the 
course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Although pregnancy 
itself is not an AE, an y complications during pregnancy should be recorded as AEs or SAEs

weeks. Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a subject exposed to the test 
article(s) should be recorded as a SAE with details documented in the pregnancy 
surveillance form. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be 
reported as an SAE.  
15. BLINDING/UNBLINDING  
An Unblinded Evaluator will document AEs and LSRs. A Blinded Evaluator will perform 
clinical evaluations (IGA and lesion counts). The Blinded Evaluator will not be involved 
in randomization, test article application instructions, or documentation of test article 
compliance.

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT #1  
Date of Amendment: November 13, 2018  
 
This protocol was amended as follows:  
• The efficacy endpoint for the VISIA assessment was fixed to  be optional, 
which aligns with the language used in other parts of the protocol that 
describe the VISIA assessment.  
• The ingredients in Test Article B were updated.  
• Text was updated to reflect that the test articles will not be dispensed in kits.  
• Subject numbers were updated to be three digit numbers.  
• The age range was changed from 12 -40 years of age (inclusive) to 9 years 
of age or older.  
• The assessment of LSRs was changed from being done by a Blinded 
Evaluator to being done by a n Unblinded Evaluator (i.e., the investigator).

Version Date: 01/30/2020    Page: 9    3 BACKGROUND 3.1 Background & Preliminary Work Up to 60% of men in the U.S. unwittingly have Gleason 6 (pure pattern 3: 3+3) prostate cancer by [CONTACT_2030] 80s on autopsy, which argues for active surveillance of this tumor (Zlotta, et al. 2013).  Long-term active surveillance cohorts demonstrate low (<5%) 15-year metastasis rates (Musunuru, et al. 2017).  However, <50% choose active surveillance when diagnosed on biopsy with Gleason 6 prostate cancer (Womble, et al. 2015).  This is due to multiple factors: (1) prostate cancer is multi-focal in >80%; (2) prostate cancer commonly has mixed grade lesions; and (3) conventional imaging modalities (US, MRI) miss significant cancer. There is also disagreement on what follow-up is needed during active surveillance. Molecular imaging agents would bring assurance and peace of mind to hundreds of thousands of men, if they are capable of selectively detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason patterns 4 and 5).  We expect to determine whether the PSMA-targeted PET agent, 68Ga-PSMA-11, reliably detects significant prostate cancer and what minimum percentage Gleason pattern 4 is required for detection by [CONTACT_886254]/MR to whole mount analysis. Multiparametric 3-T MRI has shown the ability to locate prostate cancer lesions that are higher grade and increased size. For example, MRI-targeted biopsy increases the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer using fewer cores than template biopsy (Pokorny, et al. 2017, Wysock, et al. 2014), while reducing detection of insignificant Gleason 6. However, recent studies mappi[INVESTIGATOR_85254]-mount pathology show limitations.  For example, a recent study showed only 80% of index (largest) tumors were seen by [CONTACT_886255]-index lesions (Le, et al. 2014).  Another recent study showed MRI missed a clinically significant lesion in 26% of patients using whole-mount analysis (Borofsky, et al. 2017).  Fittingly, Borofsky titled their paper, “What are we missing? False negative cancers at Multiparametric MR imaging of the prostate.”  MRI interpretation has also been shown to vary substantially across radiologists, which persisted after correcting for radiologist practice volume (Sonn, et al. 2017).  Therefore, the majority of urologists still take ultrasound-based template biopsies at the time of MRI guided biopsy (MRI-ultrasound fusion). The status quo for pathologic assessment is Gleason Grading, which combines the two dominant Gleason patterns and sometimes lists a tertiary pattern. Gleason grading might be sufficient when treating the whole gland: surgery, radiation, cryotherapy, etc.  However, conventional Gleason grading gives insufficient detail when considering active surveillance or focal therapy because the Gleason grade combines all the lesions into a

Version Date: 01/30/2020    Page: 10   single score and is not lesion specific.  For example, a prostate with three cancer lesions might be reported as Gleason 3 + 4 (90%/10%) on final pathology while the individual lesions are:  (1) 3 + 4 + 5 (30%/60%/10%), (2) 3 + 4 (90%/10%), (3) 3 + 3. Lesion (1) is clinically significant while lesion (3) is not.  Lesion (2) is of debatable significance and requires further study.  Certainly, the above 3-lesion cancer is different than a single lesion 3+[ADDRESS_1240118]-of-care as the control; the goal is to facilitate translation of molecular imaging more quickly to clinical care.   Whole mount pathologic analysis of PET imaging in prostate cancer has been reported primarily out of [LOCATION_013].  No prospective trials were found combining PSMA, PET-CT, and whole-mount analysis.  Furthermore, studies have focused on high-risk disease rather than low/intermediate risk.  For example, a retrospective trial out of [LOCATION_013] (Eiber, et al. 2016) combined 68Ga-PSMA-[ADDRESS_1240119] and found improvement in Receiver operator curve (ROC) for PET-CT over MRI (0.73 to 0.88, p<0.001).  Of the 53 patients, 53% were high risk.  The authors concluded prospective studies were warranted for biopsy guidance.  Recently, 18F-FACBC (Fluciclovine) was used with PET-CT and compared to MRI for biopsy guidance in a prospective clinical trial (Jambor, et al. 2017).  18F-FACBC had high sensitivity (87%), but low specificity (56%) resulting in a low ROC (0.72).  18F-FACBC is not specific for prostate cancer resulting in replacement with PSMA-based tracers in clinical practice. The Urology-Radiology-Pathology team at Indiana University has been employing fusion biopsy since [ADDRESS_1240120] presented at the annual meeting of the American Urologic Association in 2017 demonstrated 22% of index lesions (largest tumor) were missed by [CONTACT_9268] (Bahler, et al. 2017), and MRI undersized the index cancer lesion when compared to final pathology (2.2cm vs. 1.9cm, p = 0.03).  A tracer that is both more sensitive and specific is desired leading urologists to continue ultrasound template biopsies with MRI targeted biopsy. The 68Ga-PSMA-11 (HBED-CC) radiopharmaceutical (Eder, et al. 2014; Eiber, et al. 2015, Afshar-Oromieh, et al. 2015) is structurally based on a class of urea-derived inhibitors of PSMA (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_24124], et al. 2016). The targeting peptide has been modified at its N-terminus to incorporate the HBED-CC chelating agent with an exceptionally high binding affinity (~1039) for the Ga3+ ion (Figure 1 and Table 1).

Our initial human experience with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET was in performing patient imaging for dosimetry assessment, studying ten prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence who had been previously clinically imaged with 11C-acetate under an Expanded Access IND (Green, et al. 2017). The expected utility of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET was apparent even in that limited series, with 68Ga detection of sites of metastasis that were not apparent in 11C-acetate imaging (Figure 2).  We have subsequently dropped 11C-acetate imaging in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence in favor of 68Ga-PSMA-[ADDRESS_1240122] 70 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scans, we found improved detection (p<0.05) over 11C-acetate PET at PSA-values >2 (abstract accepted to America Urologic Association 2018 national meeting).

These subjects also received a second 68Ga-PSMA-11 dose intraoperatively to allow in vitro high-resolution PET assessment of tracer binding within the resected tissue. All staging 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans showed suspi[INVESTIGATOR_886249] (IQR) of 10.6 SUV (8-14); benign prostate had a median (IQR) of 3.8 SUV (3-5).  Four staging 68Ga-PSMA-[ADDRESS_1240124] scans showed seminal vesicle invasion, and two showed nodal involvement; all were confirmed on final pathology.  Indiana University performed >1,[ADDRESS_1240125] four years and >600 MRI-fusion biopsies during the same span.  This clinical volume will provide adequate numbers for trial accrual (n=36).  There are currently no competing trials for our study population.

MRI has far superior soft-tissue contrast compared to the CT, which cannot identify the lesions within the prostate gland by [CONTACT_5071], and cannot qualify as a “one-stop-shop” examination. Integrated utilization of PSMA PET and MRI has paramount implications for the improved diagnostic pathway of the prostate cancer. In addition to the better diagnostic potential, there is also a potential for significantly reduced cost of the total diagnostic workup of the prostate cancer using a single examination (i.e., PSMA PET-CT) compared to having a mpMRI, PSMA PET study, and a bone scan. We hypothesize the improved

PET findings will be integrated into the planning of the fusion biopsy.  See appendix C for details of the fusion biopsy. • AE assessment: AEs will be assessed at the time of 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration and also at the appointment for biopsy (if done) any event not expected is collected including but not limited to: rash and shortness of breath. • A sextant-based analysis will be performed. See appendix D for details of sextant analysis. • A secondary “per lesion” analysis will also be performed.

Reason(s) for discontinuing must be clearly documented in the appropriate source documents. 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1 Study Design Prospective, phase 2 clinical trial, single arm 9.2 Study Population The enrolled population comprises all patients who meet the eligibility criteria and are registered onto the study. 9.3 Sample Size Table 1: Sample size calculation:  sensitivity= 0.80 sensitivity= 0.85 sensitivity= 0.90 sensitivity= 0.95 Error allowed (d)= 7.5% 46 37 27 14 Error allowed (d)= 10% [ADDRESS_1240141] clinically significant (Gleason >6 and >5mm) cancer overall. In the Table above we summarized the sample size required to achieve a certain degree of accuracy for different sensitivity levels. All the calculations are based on the normal approximation of the binomial distribution. For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we will also assume the samples within each patient are independent statistically. Each patient has six samples for diagnostic testing (sextants) and the prevalence of cancer per sextant is estimated to be 40% (Eiber et al., 2016). The rows (d) present the marginal maximal error under 95% confidence interval and the columns represent the sensitivity rate. The numbers in Table 1 represent the required number of patients needed for each different combination of marginal error (d) and sensitivity rate. In other words, for a sensitivity of 90% and a marginal error of 7.5%, we

Based on Table 1, the maximal sample size is 46 assuming the sensitivity is 80%.  Therefore, we decided [ADDRESS_1240142] (Appendix D): • Sensitivity, specificity, Receiver operator curve (ROC) of mpMRI overall and for each Gleason pattern (3, 4, 5) • Sensitivity, specificity, ROC of PSMA PET-CT overall and for each Gleason pattern (3, 4, 5) 9.4.2 Secondary • Lesion based analysis of accuracy • For 3+4: Sensitivity and specificity of mpMRI based on Gleason %pattern 4 • For 3+4: Sensitivity and specificity of PET-CT based on Gleason %pattern 4 • Sensitivity and specificity for extra-capsular extension (mpMRI vs PET-CT) • Sensitivity and specificity for seminal vesicle invasion (mpMRI vs PET-CT) • Impact of PSMA PET-CT on treatment plan for surgery: o Additional lesions found, Additional sextants involved, extra-capsular extension detected, seminal vesicle invasion detected, lymph node invasion detected. • Impact of PSMA PET-CT on treatment plan for biopsy: o Additional lesions found, Additional sextants involved 9.5 Participant Characteristics Demographic characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 9.6 Concomitant Medications Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug dictionary and will be summarized in tabular format.

We will use the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to represent the values of sensitivity and specificity at different thresholds (PET= SUV, mpMRI=suspi[INVESTIGATOR_886251]). According to the ROC curve, we will determine the optimal threshold with a minimal sensitivity of 50% by [CONTACT_886256]. We will use the McNemar test to compare the sensitivity and specificity values between PET and MRI although data from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_85261].

A similar approach will be used for other secondary outcomes in Section 9.4.2 to compare the cancer detection of the mpMRI and  68Ga-PSMA-11 detection method to the surgical observations and the clinical tissue histopathology findings. 10 DATA FORMS AND SUBMISSION SCHEDULE This study will utilize the secure, web-based, Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system for data input.  REDCap was developed by [CONTACT_85275].  REDCap is managed by [CONTACT_85276].  Access to the password protected database will be limited to the investigators of this study, and any data that is distributed will be either de-identified or authorized by [CONTACT_85277]. All source documents are to remain in the patient’s clinic file.  All documents should be kept according to applicable federal guidelines.  11 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN This study will be conducted in accordance with the IU Simon Cancer Center Institutional DSMP for High Risk Trials.

Weekly meeting summaries should include review of data and subject safety by [CONTACT_85278]: the number of subjects, significant toxicities as described in the protocol, dose adjustments and responses observed. Study teams should maintain meeting minutes and attendance for submission to the DSMC upon request.    Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  The IUSCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for oversight of subject safety, regulatory compliance, and data integrity for this trial.  The DSMC will review this study semi-annually to review overall trial progress, toxicity, compliance, data integrity, and accrual per the Institutional DSMP.      Furthermore, the DSMC conducts an administrative review of serious adverse events (SAEs), deviations, reportable events, and any other outstanding business.  Major issues may require further DSMC review or action.      For any increase in frequency of grade 3 or above adverse events (above the rate reported in the Investigator Brochure or package insert), the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_85262].  The notification will include the incidence of study adverse events, grades, and attributions, as well as investigator statements regarding comparison with risks per the IB/ package insert.       At any time during the conduct of the trial, if it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_85263] (or benefits) to the subject warrant early closure of the study, the DSMC Chair and Compliance Officer must be notified within [ADDRESS_1240146] be notified within 5 business days. Alternatively, the DSMC may initiate suspension or early closure of the study based on its review. 11.1 IND Annual Reports For trials with an IND held locally by [CONTACT_886257] [INVESTIGATOR_886253], the IND Annual Report will be prepared and submitted to the Compliance Team.  This report will be reviewed by [CONTACT_886258].

Reports will be forwarded to the DSMC for review.  11.3 Data Management/OnCore Reporting Requirements   The DSMC reviews data and study progress directly from Oncore; therefore, timely data entry and status updates are vital.  Study data must be entered within Oncore promptly, no later than one week from study visit occurrence.  Subject status in Oncore will be updated in real time, as this may affect overall trial enrollment status.  Global SAEs and deviations will be reviewed on a monthly basis by [CONTACT_85279].    11.4 OnCore Safety Reporting  In addition to protocol- and regulatory-required safety reporting, all serious adverse events (SAEs) will be captured in the Oncore system within 1 business day of notification.  Initial SAE reporting will include as much detail as available, with follow-up to provide complete information.   Attributions will be assessed to study drugs, procedures, study disease, and other alternate etiology.      11.5 Study Accrual Oversight  Accrual data will be entered into the IU Simon Cancer Center OnCore system. The Protocol Progress Committee (PPC) reviews study accrual twice per year while the PPC coordinator reviews accrual quarterly. 11.6 Protocol Deviation Reporting  Protocol deviations will be entered into OnCore within 5 days of discovery and reviewed by [CONTACT_85280] a monthly basis. Findings will be reported to the full DSMC at the time of study review.  For serious or repetitive protocol deviations, additional action may be required by [CONTACT_6802].

Version Date: 01/30/2020    Page: 28   12 ADVERSE EVENTS 12.1 Definitions of Adverse Events 12.1.1 Adverse Event An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality.  Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 4.0 (Appendix A). 12.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence resulting in one or more of the following: • Results in death or ANY death occurring within [ADDRESS_1240148] dose of study drug (even if it is not felt to be drug related)  • Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85264]: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85265]:  o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85266] o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition unrelated to the study medication • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect • Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above).  Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
IUSCC-0658, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
Version Date: 01/30/2020    Page: 29   12.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Event An adverse event not mentioned in the Investigator's Brochure or package insert or the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the Investigator's brochure or package insert. 12.1.4 Determining Attribution to the Investigational Agent(s) Attribution: An assessment of the relationship between the AE and the medical intervention. CTCAE does not define an AE as necessarily “caused by a therapeutic intervention”. After naming and grading the event, the clinical investigator must assign an attribution to the AE using the following attribution categories: Relationship Attribution Description Unrelated to investigational agent/intervention Unrelated The AE is clearly NOT related Unlikely The AE is doubtfully related Related to investigational agent/intervention Possible The AE may be related Probable The AE is likely related Definite The AE is clearly related 12.2 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements: Adverse events will be recorded for the first study drug administration and also for the prostate biopsy (if indicated) regardless of whether or not the event(s) are considered related to trial medications. All AEs considered related to trial medication will be followed until resolution, return to baseline, or deemed clinically insignificant, even if this occurs post-trial. 12.2.1 Reporting to the IRB:  Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be reported promptly to the IRB if they:  • unexpected; • related or possibly related to participation in the research; and • suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized.   If the serious adverse event does not meet all three (3) criteria listed above, the event does not have to be promptly reported to the IU IRB.  However, it should be reported at the time of continuing review. 
IUSCC-0658, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
Version Date: 01/30/2020    Page: 30   Prompt reporting of unanticipated problems to the IRB is defined as within 5 days from becoming aware of the event. 12.2.2 Reporting to the IUSCC Data Safety Monitoring Committee: Regardless of study sponsorship, the study team must enter all initial and follow-up SAE, expedited, and noncompliance reports into OnCore® for review by [CONTACT_85281]/or coordinator. Expedited reports may include IRB Prompt Report Forms, AdEERS reports, MedWatch, and additional SAE forms as required by [CONTACT_456]. When follow-up information is received, a follow-up report should also be created in OnCore®. This DSMC reporting requirement is in addition to any other regulatory bodies to be notified (i.e. IRB, FDA, pharmaceutical company, etc.). The DSMC chair and/or coordinator will review all SAE, expedited, and noncompliance reports monthly. [ADDRESS_1240149] yearly, as well as notification of completion of the study and a final report within 3 months of study completion or termination.   The study will be conducted in compliance with ICH guidelines and with all applicable federal (including 21 CFR parts 56 & 50), state or local laws. 14 REFERENCES Afshar-Oromieh, A., Holland-Letz, T., Giesel, F.

For the primary outcome, a “sextant” based analysis will be performed as previously described (Eiber et al 2016). The sextants are right-base, right-mid, right-apex, left-base, left-mid, and left-apex.  Lesions <5 mm or Gleason 3+3 are generally not considered clinically relevant.          Figure 4. Three different biopsies (A-C) will be performed on each patient during a single session.

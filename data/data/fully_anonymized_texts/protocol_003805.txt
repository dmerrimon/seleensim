2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
We hypothesize  that therapy  with carfilzomib  in combi  nation  with romidepsin  and 
lenalidomide  will be a well-tolerated  and active  regimen  for subjects with relapsed  or 
refractory  B-cell and T-cell (PTCL)  lymphoma.  
a. The primary  endpoint  of the phase  Ib and IIa portion  of the study  is to 
determine  the MTD (phase  Ib) and characterize  the safety  and toxicity  profile  of 
extended  use  with the combination  carfilzomib,  romidepsin,  lenalidomide  in 
patients  with B- and T-cell lymphomas.  
b. Preliminary  efficacy  secondary  endpoints  in the phase  IIa  portion  (including  
those  treated  in the phase  Ib at MTD)  of the study  will also be assessed:  
i. Overall  response  rate (ORR)  of carfilzomib  romidepsin,  and lenalidomide  
collecti  vely as well as by [CONTACT_718533]. Complete  response  (CR) and partial response  (PR) rate; 
iii. Time   to  response   (TTR),  duration   of  response   (DOR)   and  event  free 
survi val (EFS).  
iv. Based  on safety  and preliminary secondary  endpoints further  study  could  
include:  
1. Addition  of monoclonal  antibodies  or other  agents  to regimen  
2. Randomization  against  standard  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_718491]  
3. Up-front therapy  (PTCL  only or indolent B-cell lymphoma)  
 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
3.1 Relapsed  and Refractory  B- and T-cell lymphomas  
Relapsed  and refractory  B- and T-cell lymphomas  remain  an ongoing  challenge  
with repeated  courses  of cytotoxic  chemotherapy  often  yielding  diminishing  
returns.   The 5-year overall  survival (OS) in transplant  ineligible patients  with B- 
and T-cell lymphomas  was 32%,  and 20% respecti  vely [Phillip,  1995;  Vose  J, 
2008].  There  remains significant  need  for more  acti ve therapi[INVESTIGATOR_718492]-term or maintenance  treatments  
employing  drugs  without  cumulative toxicity.  
As T-cell lymphomas  have  been  traditionally  difficult  to treat,  single  agent  overall  
response  rates  have  generally  been  in the 20-35% range.  Additionally,  durations  
of response  have  been  generally  short  lived.  Therefore,  combination  therapy  of 
well tolerated  agents  may be the best approach  to therapy.  
3.2 Proteasome  Inhibitors  in B- and T-cell Lymphomas  
Proteasome  inhibitors  were  initially  approved  for use in relapsed  and/or  refractory  
multiple  myeloma  and have  been  subsequently  found  to be effective  in mantle  cell 
lymphomas  as well as indolent  B-cell lymphomas  [Goy et al. 2005,  O‟Connor  et al 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -179 A(6)  
Approval date: 12 -Dec-2017

2005].  In follicular  lymphoma,  bortezomib,  a proteasome  inhibitor,  carries  a 55- 
70% response  rate in combination  with rituximab  [Zinzani  et al. 2012,  Coiffer  et al. 
2011].  Additionally,  in previously  untreated  diffuse  large  B-cell lymphoma,  patients  
treated  with R-CHOP  plus bortezomib  carried  a 100%  response  rate [Ruan  et al. 
2011].  
Bortezomib  has also shown  efficacy  in T-cell lymphomas  with a response  rate of 
67% as a si ngle agent.  Responses  with bortezomib  in these  patients  were  durable  
lasting  7 to 14 months  in a phase  II study  [Zinzani  et al. 2007].  Furthermore,  a 
phase  I study  of CHOP  with bortezomib  as first line treatment for aggressive  T-cell 
lymphomas  demonstrated  a 61% response  rate [Lee et al. 2008].  Therefore,  
proteasome  inhibitors  such  as bortezomib  have  demonstrated  efficacy  in these  
difficult  to treat disorders.  
3.2.1   Carfilzomib  
Carfilzomib  is a next-generation  proteasome  inhibitor  that exhibits  a high degree  of 
specificity  for the catalytic  domain  in proteolytic  active  sites within  the proteasome.  
Compared  to bortezomib  which  is a slowly  reversible  inhibitor  of the proteasome,  
carfilzomib  is mechanistically  irreversible. [Demo  et al 2007;  O‟Connor  et al. 2009]  
Carfilzomib  has been  studied  in hematologic  malignancies,  including  multiple  
myeloma,  non-Hodgkin‟s lymphomas.  [O‟Connor  et al. 2009] With regards  to its 
use in multiple  myeloma,  carfilzomib  was studied  in a multicenter  single  arm study  
of [ADDRESS_980316] two prior 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_718493].  It was administered  for two 
consecuti  ve days  weekly  for 3 weeks  of a 28 day cycle.  This study  demonstrated  
an overall  response  rate of 23.7%  with a median  duration  of response  of 7.[ADDRESS_980317]  common  side effects  included fatigue,  anemia,  nausea  and 
thrombocytopenia.  [Seigel  et al. 2012]  A similar  study  in bortezomib  naïve patients  
demonstrated  an overall  response  rate of 64.2%  and the median  duration  of 
response  was not reached.  [Vij et al. 2012]  It was based  on these  studies  that 
carfilzomib  gained  fast track  FDA approval for the treatment  of relapsed/refractory  
multiple  myeloma  in 2012.  Carfilzomib  has also been  studied  in combination  with 
dexamethasone  using a weekly  dosing  schedule  at ≥45mg/m2  in patients  with 
relapsed/refractory  multiple  myeloma.   In these  studies,  half-life was found  to be 
comparable  and AUC was found  to be higher  than on the traditional  schedule.   The 
overall  response  rate was found  to be 67%.  [ Berenson  et al. 2013]  
3.3. Histone  Deacetylase  Inhibitors  in B- and T-cell lymphomas:  Romidepsin  
Romidepsin  is a potent  histone  deacetylase  (HDAC)  inhibitor  which  causes  arrest  
of the cell cycle  at both G1 and G2/M  phases,  induces  the internucleosomal  
breakdown  of chromatin, and inhibits  intracellular  HDAC  acti vity resulting  in an 
accumulation  of marked  amounts  of acetylated  histone  species  within  M-8 cells 
[Nakajima  Y, 1998].  The proposed  mechanism  of action  in B-cell lymphomas  is 
through  the proto-oncogene BCL6  that is highly  acti ve as a transcriptional  
repressor  within  the germinal  B cell. Uncurbed  activity  of BCL6  lends  to 
suppression  of genes  involved  in lymphocyte  acti vation,  differentiation,  cell cycle  
arrest,  and apoptosis.   Moreover,  accumulation  of acetylated  BCL6  is known  to

down  regulate  the transcriptional  repressive  function  allowing  gene  transcription  of 
beneficial  pro-apoptotic  cellular  products  in the otherwise  malignant  cell. 
[Boreschenko  O, 2002]  
Romidepsin  has not been  cli nically  studied  as a single  agent  in B-cell lymphomas,  
but is undergoing  evaluation  in combi  nation  with lenalidomide  in a phase  Ia/IIb  
study  in hematologic  malignancies  [NCTG:  01755975]  However,  other  HDAC  
inhibitors  (vorinostat, belinostat,  and panobinostat)  have  demonstrated  cli nical 
activity  in early  phase  studies.  For example,  in a combined  analysis  of two 
consecuti  ve phase  I trials  in hematologic  malignancies  performed  at MSK  utilizing 
vorinostat, an HDAC  inhibitor,  of those  enrolled  32 had a B-cell non-Hodgkin  
lymphoma  (NHL).  Three  of these  patients  responded  with one achieving a CR. 
[O‟Connor  O, 2005] Furthermore,  the HDAC  inhibitor  panobinostat was employed  
in a phase  II single  agent  study  with 13 patients  having  relapse  or refractory  
Hodgkin  lymphoma.  In this subgroup  , 5 or 13 achieved  a partial  response.  
[Ottman  O, 2008]  In a more  recent  study  the same  drug was employed  specifically  
for relapsed  disease  after autologous  stem  cell transplantation  with an ORR  of 
13%.  [Younes,  2009]  
The demonstrated  cli nical activity  of romidepsin  in T-cell lymphoma  is more  robust.  
Romidepsin  first demonstrated  acti vity in a National Cancer  Institute  (NC I) phase  I 
study.  [Sandor  V, 2002]  Three  patients  with cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma  (CTCL)  
and 1 with significant  cutaneous  involvement of peripheral  T-cell lymphoma  
(PTCL)  all demonstrated  a response  to romidepsin  at varying dose  levels  (12.7  to 
17.8 mg/m2).  The patient  with PTCL  experienced  a complete  remission  after 8 
cycles  of romidepsin.  Subsequently,  romidepsin  was further  evaluated  in 135 
evaluable  subjects  with CTCL  in Study  GPI-04-0001  and NCI Study  1312.  
[Rasheed  W, 2008]  Across  all 135 evaluable  subjects  with CTCL,  the overall  
response  rate (ORR)  was 41% (55/135)  and the complete  response  (CR) rate was 
7% (10/135).  Subjects  with advanced  disease  had a similar  ORR as subjects  with 
earlier  stage  disease:  42% for ≥ stage  IIB and 38% for stage  I or IIA disease.  
Romidepsin  was active  in all sites of disease,  including  skin, lymph  nodes,  viscera,  
and blood.  The median  duration  of response  was 454 days  (14.9  months).  
Although  the median  time to response  was 57 days  (1.9 months),  in some  cases  
an objecti  ve response  to romidep sin was achieved  after ≥6 months.  Across  all 135 
subjects  included  in the pooled  evaluable  subjects  analysis  set, median  time to 
disease  progression  was 252 days  (8.3 months).  These  data led to FDA approval  
of romidepsin  for CTCL  in September  2009.  
In the initial  Phase  2 NC I-sponsored  study  in 48 subjects  with PTCL  or other  T-cell 
lymphomas  were  enrolled  in addition  to the CTCL  patients  listed  above.  [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_79577]  
R, 2005]  Among  all 48 subjects,  the ORR (CR+PR)  was 31% (15/48).  The CR and 
PR rates  were  8% (4 /48) and 23% (11/48),  respectively.  When  response  was 
evaluated  among  the 34 subjects  who received  2 cycles  of therapy,  the ORR was 
44% (15/34)  and the CR and PR rates  were  12% (4/34)  and 32% (7/34),  
respectively.  
This acti vity of romidepsin  in PTCL  was confirmed  in the multi -center  Phase  2 
study   of  131  patients   with  relapsed   PTCL.   [Coiffier   B,  2011]    The  objecti  ve

response  rate was 25% (33/130),  including 15% (19/130)  with CR/CRu.  Response  
rates  were  not impacted  by [CONTACT_718534],  prior stem -cell transplant,  
number  or type of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  or response  to last prior therapy.  The median  
duration  of response  was [ADDRESS_980318]  response  ongoing  at 34+ 
months.  Of the 19 patients  who achieved  CR/CRu,  17 (89%)  had not progressed  
at a median  follow -up of 13.[ADDRESS_980319]  common  grade  ≥ 3 adverse  
events  were  thrombocytopenia  (24%),  neutropenia  (20%),  and infections  (all types,  
19%).    This data led to FDA approval  of romidepsin  for PTCL  in June  of 2011.  
3.4 Lenalidomide  in B- and T-cell Lymphomas  
Lenalidomide  is an IMiD®  compound  that has become  a commonly  used  agent  as 
a partner  with rituximab  or in multi -agent  approaches  in the treatment  of B-cell 
malignancies.  IMiD®  compounds  have  both immunomodulatory  and anti- 
angiogenic  properties  which  confer  antitumor  effects.  Although  the exact  antitumor  
mechanism  of action  of lenalidomide  is unknown,  a number  of mechanisms  are 
postulated  to be responsible  for lenalidomide‟s  activity  against  B- and T-cell 
lymphoid  malignancies.  Lenalidomide  has been  demonstrated  to possess  anti- 
angiogenic  activity  through  inhibition  of bFGF,  VEGF,  and TNF-alpha  induced  
endothelial  cell migration,  due at least in part to inhibition of Akt phosp  horylation  
response  to bFGF.  [Dredge  K, 2005]  In addition,  lenalidomide  has a variety  of 
immunomodulatory  effects.  Lenalidomide  stimulates  T-cell proliferation,  and the 
production  of IL-2, IL-10 and IFN-gamma, inhibits  IL-1 beta and IL-6 and 
modulates  IL-12 production.  [Corral  L, 1999]  The increased  level of these  
circulating  cytokines  augment  natural  killer cell number  and function,  and enhance  
natural  killer cell activity  to yield an increase in cell lysis.  [Davies  F, 2001]  
Upregulation  of T cell derived IL-[ADDRESS_980320]  in part through  
increased  AP-1 acti vity. [Schafer  P, 2003]  
Lenalidomide  has been  investigated  in both relapsed  and refractory  indolent  and 
aggressive  non-Hodgkins  lymphoma  as well as Hodgkin  lymphoma.  In aggressi  ve 
B-cell lymphomas,  [ADDRESS_980321]. [Wiernik  P, 2008]  An ORR  of 35% was seen  
with a complete  response  rate of 13%.  Interestingly,  a quarter  of those  who 
achieved  a partial  response  at the time of first response  assessment  achieved  
further  response  with subsequent  cycles.  The toxicities  were  similar  with a grade  4 
neutropenia  and thrombocytopenia  of 8.2%.  In indolent B-cell lymphoma  
lenalidomide  has been  studied  in a similar  dosing  and duration  strategy.  The 
outcomes  in 43 patients  yielded  an ORR  of 23% with 7% achieving  a complete  
response.  Importantly,  at the time of publication  the median  duration  of response  
had not been  met, but was longer  than 16.5 months.  Toxicities  were  again  
predictable  to include  grade  4 neutropenia  and thrombocytopenia  of 16% and 5% 
respectively.  [Witzig  T, 2009]  Lastly,  lenalidomide  has been  studied  in refractory  
and heavily  pretreated  cohort  of 12 patients  with Hodgkin  lymphoma.  [Boll B, 2009]  
While  the main  objecti  ve of the study  was to characterize  the toxicity  in this cohort  
50% of the patient  did achieve  an objective  response.  Interesti  ngly, no grade  3 or 
4 toxicities  were  reported in this study.

Lenalidomide  has also been  studied  in PTCL  as a si ngle agent. A multicenter  
phase  II study  in relapsed  PTCL  lenalidomide  when  dosed  at 25 mg orally  for 21 
days of a 28-day cycle  achieved  an ORR  of 30% with all responses  being  partial  
responses.  [Deuck  G, 2010]  Grade  4 thrombocytopenia  was seen  in 33% of 
patients  while  grade  3 neutropenia  was seen  in 21%.  Interestingly,  development  
of a ski n rash was correlated  with those  who obtained  a response.  A smaller  study  
of lenalidomide  in PTCL,  also showed  a 30% ORR  at the same  dose  and 
schedule. [Zinzani P, 2011 ] 
A small  phase  2 study  of lenalidomide  in CTCL  yielded  a similar  degree  of activity.  
Among  the 24 patients  reported  by [CONTACT_718535]., the ORR  was 32%.  However,  
in these  patients  dose -limiting  skin toxicity  was seen  at the 25 mg dose  and dose  
de-escalation  to 10 mg was performed.  [Querfeld,  2011]  In this study  significant  
skin tumor  flare may have  confounded  disease  assessment  among  the CTCL  
patients  resulting  in premature  withdrawal from study  due to spurious  progression.  
3.5 Rationale  for Combination  Therapy  
Relapsed  and refractory  B- and T-cell lymphoid  malignancies  are a challenge  
faced  daily.  Current  paradigms  approaches  led many  patients  down  a path of 
multiple  cytotoxic  combination  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_718494]-term disease  free 
control  or used  as a strategy  towards  chemosensitivity  for stem  cell 
transplantation.  However,  treatment  limiting  toxicities  are often  encountered  and 
repeated  courses  of cytotoxic  chemotherapy  often  yield diminishi  ng returns.  There  
remains  significant  need  for more  active  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_718495].  
In precli  nical studies  of Namalwa  cells (derived from a Burkitt  lymphoma),  
lenalidomide  had synergistic  effects  with valproic  acid (a known  histone  
deacetylase  inhibitor) by [CONTACT_718536]34+  progenitor  cells.  [Verhelle  D, 2007]  Furthermore,  in 
multiple  myeloma  cells,  a combination  of lenalidomide  with panobinostat,  another  
HDAC  inhibitor,  has shown  additive  or greater  activity  in both in vitro and in vivo 
models.  [Ocio  E, 2007;  Ocio E, 2010]  The study  of the combi  nation  of a HDAC  
inhibitor  and lenalidomide  are ongoing  in patients  with relapsed  and refractory  
multiple  myeloma.  In two phase  I dose  finding studies,  the oral HDAC  inhibitor  
vorinostat has been  safely  combined  with lenalidomide  at the MTD  and full 
standard  approved  doses  (400 mg of vorinostat and 25 mg lenalidomide)  of eac h 
drug alone  without  significant  dose  limiting  toxicities  [Siegel  D 2009;  Kaufman  J 
2010;  Richardson  P, 2010].  
Among  novel,  non-chemotherapeutic  agents,  lenalidomide  and romidepsin  have  
shown  significant  acti vity in a broad  range  of lymphoid  malignancies  with good  
safety  profiles,  absence  of cumulative toxicities,  and fundamentally  different  
mechanisms  of action  than the chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_718496].  Among  the HDAC  inhibitors,  romidepsin  has shown  the most  potent  
clinical  activity  when  similar  diseases  have  been  studied.

Administrative Update 1 : [ADDRESS_980322]  been  conducti  ng a phase  Ib/IIa  study  of lenalidomide  with romidepsin  
among  patients  with B - and T-cell lymphomas.  While  the MTD has not been  
determined  in this study  (currently  enrolling  into the last cohort;  full dose  
romidepsin  with full dose  lenalidomide),  overall  response  rate among  the patients  
evaluable  for response  (n=13)  patients  accrued  in this study  is 54% (n=7)  with 
39% PR (n=5)  and 15% CR (n=2).  Responses  by [CONTACT_718537] 67% in T-cell 
lymphomas,   50%  in  B-cell  lymphomas,   and  33%  in  Hodgkin  lymphoma   with 
responses  ongoing  at >[ADDRESS_980323]  tolerated  doses  of 
lenalidomide  25mg  with romidepsin  10mg/m2. Only one patient  experienced  dose  
limiting  toxicity with  pneumococcal  bacteremia.  Therefore,  this combination  
appears  to be a promising  strategy  for patients  with relapsed/refractory  B- and T- 
cell lymphomas.  
Additionally,  there  is evidence  for the combination  of HDAC  with proteasome  
inhibitors.  Studies  in pancreatic  cancer,  ovarian  cancer,  melanoma,  pancreatic  
cancer,  lung cancer,  multiple  myeloma,  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia,  primary  
effusion  lymphoma  have  all shown  in vivo, in vitro and early  clinical  synergy  
between  HDAC  and proteasome  inhibitors.  [Kikuchi  et al 2013,  Bhatt  et al 2013,  
Bastian  et al 2013,  Huang  et al 2012,  Gatti et al 2012,  Millward  et al 2012]  The 
synergy  between  HDAC  and proteasome  inhibitors is most  likely  dependent  on a 
number  of mechanisms.  In multiple  myeloma  cell lines, the use of romidepsin in 
particular  enhanced  in vitro and in vivo acti vity of bortezomib.  [Kikuchi  et al 2010].  
One proposed  mechanism  for this synergy  was enhanced  inhibition  of the 
proteasome.  In multiple  myeloma  cells previously  exposed  to a proteasome  
inhibitor,  the addition  of an HDAC  inhibitor  resulted  in apoptosis  through  
mitochondrial  dysfunction  and caspase  mobilization  [Pei et al. 2004].  Manipulation  
of the aggresome,  an analogous  protein  degradation  pathway,  by [CONTACT_718538]  [Hideshima,  Richardson,  Anderson  2011].  In combi  nation,  
these  pathways  may disrupt  cellular  or microenvironment  communication  and 
result  in apoptosis.  However  it is unlikely  that these  are the sole mechanisms  for 
synergy  between  these  classes  of agents,  which  remains an area of intense 
investigation.  
It has been  established  in multiple  myeloma  that IMiDs  and proteasome  inhibitors  
are synergistic  and the combination  can often  overcome  refractory  clones  that 
have  been  previously  been  exposed  to either  class  as a single  agent.  In hopes  to 
expand  on this synergy,  a phase  I study  was conducted  in patients  with newly  
diagnosed  multiple  myeloma  were  treated  with lenalidomide,  bortezomib,  
dexamethasone  with the addition  of the HDAC  inhibitor  vorinostat.  This study  
demonstrated  that the regimen  was efficacious  with an overall  response  rate of 
100%  amongst  the evaluable  patients  (n=29)  [Kaufman  et al 2012].  In this study,  
the most  common  toxicities  included  thrombocytopenia,  constipation,  diarrhea,  
fatigue,  nausea  and neuropathy.  Grade  3 or higher  toxicity  that occurred  in 10% or 
greater  patients  was thrombocytopenia,  fatigue,  neutropenia,  neuropathy  or 
cardiovascular  toxicity  denoting a well tolerated  up-front strategy.

Given  the need  for better  tolerated  and more  active  therapy  for patients  with 
relapsed  and refractory  B- and T-cell malignancies  we propose  a phase  Ib/IIa  
study  of carfilzomib,  romidepsin,  lenalidomide.  This would  be a strategy  to build  
upon  the data the will be produced  from the currently  accruing  phase  Ib/IIa  with 
romidepsin  and lenalidomide  (not yet published).  We believe  that the addition  of 
carfilzomib  to romidepsin  and lenalidomide  will improve  response  rates  and will be 
well tolerated.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
We plan to perform  an open  label  phase  Ib/IIa  study  of patients  with 
relapsed/refractory  B- and T-cell lymphomas  who are treated  with carfilzomib,  
lenalidomide  and romidepsin  in a 3+3 design  (see section  9.2).  The phase  IIa 
portion  of the study  will involve a dose  expansion  at the MTD  to better  characterize 
the efficacy  and to inform  further  disease  specific  studies.  
 
Phase  Ib: The phase  Ib portion  of the study  is designed  to determine  the MTD  of 
carfilzomib,  romidepsin  and lenalidomide.  All patients  must  have a relapsed  or 
refractory  B-cell or T-cell lymphoma.  The design  is a standard  3+3 dose  escalation  
(Table  3) of carfilzomib,  romidepsin  and lenalidomide.  The first cohort  will enter  at 
dose  level 1.  For details  please  see section  9.2. 
 
Three  patients  will be initially  treated  in each  cohort  until the MTD  is determined. 
If dose  level [ADDRESS_980324] measurable  disease  at point  of study  entry  as allowed  in 
the phase  Ib portion.  
 
Phase  IIa: The phase  IIa portion  will further  assess  the toxicity  and safety  and allow  
a preliminary assessment  of the efficacy  of the combination  to provide  background  
for a potential  future  subtype specific  phase  II study.  The assessment  of efficacy  
will be descripti  ve. At the time of enrollment  the patients  will be identified  as 
representing  two cohorts  based  upon  disease  subtype:  1) B-cell lymphoma  2) T- 
cell lymphoma. Each  cohort  will enroll  10 patients  including  those  treated  at the 
MTD of the phase  Ib portion.  The assessment  of toxicity  and efficacy  will be 
performed  within  the entire  cohort  evaluable  at MTD.  A preplanned  exploratory  
analysis  of the toxicity  and efficacy  of the disease  specific  cohorts  will also be 
performed.   Efficacy  measures  which  will be determined  include  ORR  , TTR,  DOR,

response  of CR/Cru  or PR at any disease  assessment  time point.  TTR is defined  
as the time or number  of cycles  between  study  registration  and documentation  of 
first response  (CR/Cru  or PR). DOR  is defined as the time or number  of cycles  
between  documentation  of first response  and progression,  change  of therapy,  
death,  or date of last contact  (if still alive without  progression).  EFS is defined as 
the time between study  registration  and documented  progression,  change  in 
therapy,  or death  if no progression  was observed.  
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
All patients  will be treated  with romidepsin  administered  intravenously  on days 1 
and 8 of a 21-day cycle.  Lenalidomide  will be taken  orally  daily  for days  1-14 of a 
21-day cycle.  The carfilzomib  will be given  weekly  on days  1, and 8 of a 21-day 
cycle . Once  a MTD  is determined this dosing  level will be used  for the phase  IIa 
portion.  Cycles will be conti  nued  as above  until the patient‟s  wishes  to be removed  
from the study,  unacceptable  toxicity develops,  disease  progression,  treating 
physician  recommends  removal,  or termination  of study  occurs.  
 
 
5.1 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
 
5.2 REVLIMID®  
REVLIMID® (lenalidomide),  a thalidomide  analogue,  is an immunomodulatory  
agent  with anti-angiogenic  properties.  The empi[INVESTIGATOR_128099] 
C13H13N3O3, and the gram  molecular  weight  is 259.3.  The chemical  name  [CONTACT_832] 3-(4-

Lenalidomide  is off-white  to pale-yellow  solid powder.  It is soluble  in organic  
solvent/water  mixtures, and buffered  aqueous  solvents.  Lenalidomide  is more  
soluble  in organic  solvents  and low pH solutions.  Solubility  was significantly  lower  
in less acidic  buffers,  ranging  from about  0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml.  Lenalidomide  has an 
asymmetric  carbon  atom  and can exist as the optically  acti ve forms  S(-) and R(+),  
and is produced  as a racemic  mixture  with a net optical  rotation  of zero.  
The mechanism  of action of lenalidomide  remains  to be fully characterized. 
Lenalidomide  possesses  immunomodulatory  and antiangiogenic  properties.  
Lenalidomide  inhibited  the secretion  of pro-inflammatory  cytokines  and increased

the secretion  of anti-inflammatory cytoki  nes from peripheral  blood  mononuclear  
cells.  Lenalidomide  inhibited  cell proliferation  with varying  effectiveness  (IC50s) i n 
some  but not all cell lines. Of cell lines tested,  lenalidomide  was effective  in 
inhibiting  growth  of Namalwa  cells (a human  B cell lymphoma  cell line with a 
deletion  of one chromosome  5) but was much  less effective  in inhibiting growth  of 
KG-1 cells (human  myeloblastic  cell line, also with a deletion  of one chromosome  
5) and other  cell lines without  chromosome  5 deletions.  Lenalidomide  inhibited  the 
expression  of cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2) but not COX -1 in vitro. 
 
 
 
5.1.1   Absorption:  
Lenalidomide,  in healthy  volunteers,  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_718497]  0.[ADDRESS_980326]-dose.  Co-administration  with food does  not alter the extent  of 
absorption  (AUC)  but does  reduce  the maximal  plasma  concentration  (Cmax)  by 
36%.  The pharmacokinetic  disposition  of lenalidomide  is linear.  Cmax  and AUC 
increase  proportionately  with increases  in dose.  Multiple  dosing  at the 
recommended dose -regimen  does  not result  in drug accumulation.  
Pharmacokinetic  analyses  were  performed  on 15 multiple  myeloma  patients  
treated  in the phase  I studies.  Absorption  was found  to be rapid  on both Day 1 
and Day 28 with time to maximum  blood  levels  ranging  from 0.7 to 2.0 hours  at all 
dose  levels  (5mg,  10mg,  25mg,  and 50mg).  No plasma  accumulation  was 
observed  with multiple  daily  dosing.  Plasma  lenalidomide  declined  in a 
monophasic  manner  with elimination  half-life ranging  from 2.8 to 6.1 hours  on both 
Day 1 and 28 at all 4 doses.  Peak  and overall  plasma  concentrations  were  dose  
proportional  over the dosi ng range  of 5mg to 50mg.  Exposure  (AUC)  in multiple  
myeloma  patients  is 57% higher  than in healthy  male  volunteers.  
 
 
5.1.2  Pharmacokinetic  Parameters:  
Distribution:  
In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide  binding  to plasma  proteins  is approximately  30%.  
Metabolism  and Excretion:  
The metabolic  profile of lenalidomide  in humans  has not been  studied.  In healthy  
volunteers,  approximately  two-thirds  of lenalidomide  is eliminated  unchanged  
through  urinary  excretion.  The process  exceeds  the glomerular  filtration  rate and 
therefore  is partially  or entirely  active.  Half-life of elimination  is approximately  3 
hours.

5.2     Romidepsin 
Romidepsin  (ISTODAX®) is a unique  bicyclic  depsipeptide  originally  isolated  from 
Chromobacterium  violaceum  strain  968. [Ueda  H, 1994]  Romidepsin  is an 
antineoplastic agent  that has been  identified  as a novel  HDAC  inhibitor.  
Romidepsin  has been  shown  to induce  hyperacetylation  of histones  and other  
nonhistone  protein  species  resulting  in a variety  of phenotypic  changes,  induction  
of the upregulation  of gene  transcription,  G1 and G2/M  arrest  of the cell cycle,  
morphological  reversion  of transformed  cells,  cell growth  inhibition, apoptotic  cell 
death,  and inhibition of angiogenesis.

5, 6, 7, 9, 10), and Class  IV (HDAC  11) HDACs,  causi  ng chromatin  remodeling  and

5.2.2  Storage  and Handling  
 
The dual pack  is to be stored  at 20 to 25ºC  (68 to 77°F),  excursions  permitted  
between  15 to 30°C  (59 to 86°F)  [USP  controlled  room  temperature].  Romidepsin  
(for infusion)  is stable  for at least 36 months  at 25°C/60%  relative humidity  (RH) as 
well as for 6 months  at 40°C/75%  RH and is stable  against  heat (for 3 months  at 
50°C)  and humidity  (for 3 months  at 25°C/83%  RH). Appropriately  trained personnel  
using  aseptic  technique  should  reconstitute  the drug.  A volume  of [ADDRESS_980331]  stock  solution  at 5 
mg/mL  is chemically  stable  for at least  8 hours  at room  temperature.  However,  
whenever  possible, drug should  be prepared  within 4 hours  of dose  administration. A 
volume  of the 5 mg/mL  stock  solution  contai  ning the appropriate  dose  for the patient  
will be diluted  in 0.9%  Sodium  Chloride Injection,  USP (0.9%  sali ne) for intravenous 
infusion,  as directed  by [CONTACT_760].  This dilution  should  result  in a final drug 
concentration  within  the demonstrated  stability  range  of 0.02 to 0.16 mg/mL  for 
reconstituted  romidepsin,  that is compatible  with polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC),  ethylene

5.3 Carfilzomib  
Carfilzomib  (trade  name  [CONTACT_275596]®)  is an analog  of epoxomicin  and eponemyci  n, a pair 
of related  natural  products  that were  initially  discovered  as antitumor  agents  in animals,  
and later shown  to inhibit  the chymotrypsi  n-like (CT-L) acti vity of the 20S proteasome.  
 
Carfilzomib,  atetrapeptide  epoxyketone  proteasome inhibitor, was FDA approved  for the 
treatment  of relapsed  and refractory  multiple  myeloma.  Carfilzomib  is a potent,  selecti  ve, 
and irreversible  inhibitor  of the CT-L acti vity of the constituti  ve proteasome  (the form of 
proteasome  found  in most  cell types)  and the immunoproteasome  (the form of 
proteasome  found  in many  hematopoietic  cells)  . In studies  comparing  carfilzomib  to 
bortezomib,  both were  found  to inhibit the CT-L acti vity of the proteasome  with 
comparable  potency  [Demo  2007].  
 
Incubation  of tumor  cells in culture  with carfilzomib  results  in rapid  and sustai  ned  
inhibition  of proteasome  activity,  accumulation  of polyubiquiti  nated  proteins,  and induction  
of apoptosis  [Demo  2007].  The period  of time required  to induce  apoptosis  varies  among  
tumor  cell types  and is a function  of the depth  and duration  of proteasome  inhibition,  with 
cells derived  from hematological  tumors  being  the most  sensitive  to brief periods  of 
proteasome  inhibition.

The molecular  formula  of carfilzomib  is C40H57N5O7 and its molecular  weight  is 719.9 .  It‟s 
chemical  name  [CONTACT_832] (2S)-N-((S)-1-((S)-4-methyl -1-((R)-2-methyloxiran -2-yl)-1-oxopentan -2-

Intravenous  administration of carfilzomib  in humans  over [ADDRESS_980333] dose  of 
carfilzomib  for each  week  of dosing,  with 30-minute and bolus  infusions. 
 
5.3.1  Pharmacokinetic  Parameters  
Following intravenous administration of doses  ≥ 15 mg/m2,  carfilzomib was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_718498] a half-life of ≤ 1 hour on Day 1 of Cycle  1. The 
systemic  clearance  ranged  from 151 to 263 L/hour,  and exceeded  hepatic  blood  flow, 
suggesti  ng that carfilzomib  was largely  cleared  extrahepatically.  The pathways  of 
carfilzomib  elimination have  not been  characterized in humans.  [Onyx  2013]  
 
 
5.3.2  Dose  Administration  
 
• Carfilzomib  will be diluted  in 100 mL D5W  and administered over approximately  30 
minutes.  
 
• The dose  is calculated  using  the patient ‟s actual  body  surface  area (BSA)  at 
baseline.  Patients  with a BSA greater  than 2.2 m2 should  receive  a dose  based  upon  
a BSA of 2.2 m2. Dose  adjustments  do not need  to be made  for weight  changes  of 
less than or equal  to 10%.  Carfilzomib  may be rounded  according  to local 
institutional rounding  guidelines.  
 
• Prior  to each  dose  of carfilzomib  in Cycle 1, give [ADDRESS_980334]  the 250 mL to 500 mL total volume  and may be used as prehydration  
for carfilzomib  . Continue  IV hydration,  as needed,  in subsequent  cycles.  In patients  
with chronic  kidney  disease  or history  of congesti  ve heart  failure,  one may consider  
holding hydration in addition to the romidepsin volume.

• With cycle  1, pre-medicate  with dexamethasone  4 mg PO or IV prior to all doses  of 
carfilzomib.  Additionally,  if dose  escalating,  please  also plan to premedicate  with 
dexamethasone  4mg PO or IV to reduce  the incidence  and severity  of infusion  
reactions.  Reinstate dexamethasone  premedication  (4 mg PO or IV) if these  
symptoms  develop  or reappear  during subsequent  cycles.  Dexamethasone  
premedication  dosing  has been  increased  to 8 mg PO or IV in clinical  trials  where  
the carfilzomib  dose  has exceeded  45 mg/m2. 
• It is preferred  that carfilzomib  is given  after romidepsin.  
• The Initial  dose  of carfi lzomib  given  to any given  patient  (cycle  1, day 1) will be 
20mg/m2 regardless  of the dose  level.  Subsequent  doses  will be based  on the 
patient ‟s dose  level.  
 
5.3.3  Storage  and Handling  
Carfilzomib  for Injection  is supplied  as si ngle-use vials contai  ning a dose  of 60 mg of 
carfilzomib  as a white  to off-white  lyophilized cake  or powder.  Carfilzomib  vials contain  no 
antimicrobial  preservati  ves and are intended  only for si ngle use. 
 
Unopened  vials of carfilzomib  are stable  until the date indicated  on the package  when  
stored  in the original package  at 2 °C to 8°C (36°F  to 46°F). Retain  carfilzomib  in the 
original  package  to protect  from light. The reconstituted  solution  contains  carfi lzomib  at a 
concentration  of 2 mg/mL.

Prior  to initiation  of each  dose  of romidepsin  in cycle  1 and cycle  2 the patients  level 
of potassium  (K+) and magnesium  (Mg) must  be confirmed  to be greater  than or 
equal  to the lower  limit of normal  for the testi ng laboratory,  or corrected  to those  
levels.  In cycle  3 and beyond,  magnesi  um and potassi  um levels  may be checked  
up to 3 days  before  romidepsin.  If within  treatment  range  they do not need  to be 
repeated  prior to romidepsin  administration. Intravenous  (IV) supplementation  with 
potassium  chloride  (KCL)  and/or  magnesium  sulfate  can be used.  If 
supplementation  is necessary,  documentation  of levels  after IV supplementation  is 
required.  Supplementation  with oral KCL or magnesium  oxide  (MgOX)  or 
magnesium  soy (MgSoy)  can be used.  These  parameters  apply  to both the phase  
Ib and IIa portion  of the study.

and activity  seen  during the phase  Ib portion,  additional dose  levels  and/or  alternate  
28 day cycle  may be explored  through  an amendment.  The carfilzomib  will be 
given  intravenously weekly  on days 1 and 8. The romidepsin  will be given  
intravenously  on days 1 and 8. The lenalidomide  will be given  as a once  a day oral 
drug given  on days  1-14. It is preferred  that romidepsin  be administered prior to

If all three  patients  complete  one cycle  of therapy  without a DLT at the respecti  ve 
dose  level then the subsequent  dose  level can be accrued.  A DLT is defined  in cycle  1 of the phase  I portion  as: • Non-hematologic  toxicity  of grade  ≥3 (attributed  to study  drugs  with the exception  of alopecia  , nausea , or grade  ≥3 vomiting  not responsive to 
antiemetics)  
• Hematologic  grade  4 toxicity  (attributed  to study  drugs)  defined  as grade  4 
thrombocytopenia  of any duration;  grade  4 neutropenia  lasti ng more  than 5 
days; or grade 4 anemia unexplained by [CONTACT_54648] 
• Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia  with cli nically  significant  bleeding  
• Febrile  neutropenia  of any duration  (ANC  <1.0K/  µL with fever  38.5oC) 
• Inability  to receive  day 1 of cycle  2 due to conti  nued  drug-related  toxicity  
including  Grade  ≥ 2 toxicity  that does  not resolve  to Grade  ≤ 1 by [CONTACT_718546].  
• Grade  3 thrombocytopenia  or neutropenia  (attributed  to study  drug)  within  
cycle  1 that results  in a) ≥ 4 day delay  in any romidepsin or  carfilzomib  dose  
or b) missing  greater  than 4 days  of lenalidomide.  (This  criteria  only applies  
to the phase  Ib portion and does  not apply  to the phase  IIa stoppi  [INVESTIGATOR_004]).

toxicity  will be replaced  for determination of MTD.  
 
The treatment  plan is described  below  for the phase  Ib portion : 
• Romidepsin/Lenalidomide/Carfilz  omib:   Romidepsin  IVPB  over 4  hours  
on days  1 and 8 
• Carfilzomib  IVPB  administered  over approximately  30 minutes on days  1 
and 8** 
• Lenalidomide  PO q days 1-14 
 
 
**[ADDRESS_980346] the timeline  listed  above,  the MSK  Principal  
Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_718501].  
 
Of note,  if patient‟s  experiences  a greater  than 10% change  in body  weight,  dose  
of romidepsin  and carfilzomib  should  be adjusted  accordi  ngly. Doses  do not need  
to be adjusted  for less than 10% changes  in body  weight.  
 
a. Treatment  Plan:  carfilzomib/romidepsin/lenalidomide  Phase  IIa 
The phase  IIa portion  is planned  to include  [ADDRESS_980347] 10 patients.  Patients  treated  at MTD  in the phase  
Ib cohort  (if measurable  disease  at enrollment)  will be included  towards  the 20 
patient  total in the phase  IIa. The MTD has been  determined  to be dose  level 1; 8 
mg/m2 romidepsin  on days  1 and 8, 15 mg lenalidomide  from days  1 - 14, and 36 
mg/m2 carfilzomib  on days  [ADDRESS_980348] received  long-term therapy  (greater   than  one 
year)  with response  will be allowed  to have  their schedule  modified  
to allow  less frequent  dosing  per investigator  and primary  
investigator  discretion.  
b. Lenalidomide  administration  
In either  phase  of the study  patients  will be asked  to take the lenalidomide  at 
approximately  the same  time each  day.  If a dose  of lenalidomide  is missed,  it 
should  be taken  as soon  as possible  on the same  day.  If it is missed  for the entire  
day, it should  not be made  up. A medication  diary  will be provided  to the patient  
and asked  to be returned  prior to each  cycle  [See Appendix  G]. Any pi[INVESTIGATOR_718502].

immediately.  
9.4 Prophylactic  Measures  
• Subjects  should  receive  prophylactic  anti-emetics  prior to romidepsin  and 
carfilzomib  administration (ondansetron  preferred).  
• Subjects  should  receive  dexamethasone  4mg PO or IVPB  prior to the first two 
cycles  of carfi lzomib.  Dexamethasone  is optional  for the subsequent  cycles.  
• G-CSF may be given  at the discretion  of the treating  physician.  
• Subjects  should  be taki ng prophylaxis  against varicella  zoster  per the 
institutional guidelines (e.g. acyclovir  400mg  by [CONTACT_206941])  while  on this 
regimen.  
9.5 Concomitant  Medications  
 
Patients  will be instructed  not to take any additional  medications  (including  over- 
the-counter  products)  during the trial without prior consultation  with their treating 
physician.  All medications  taken  within  [ADDRESS_980350] be recorded  in 
the electronic  Case  Report  Forms  (eCRFs)  and in the source  documents.  
Supportive therapy,  that is ongoing at baseline,  will be permitted  during the 
treatment  phase  of the study.  If other   therapy  for  the  disease   is  required,  
conti nuation  of the study  treatment  should  be discussed  with the MSKPrincipal  
Investigator.  Concomitant  medications  for other  medical  conditions  are permitted  
as clinically  indicated  subject to specific  protocol  requirements  outlined  below.  
9.5.1  Prohibited/monitored  concurrent  therapy  
• Any investigational agent  other  than lenalidomide  or romidepsin.  
• Any medications  at high risk of causing  QTc/QTf  prolongation  or inducing  
torsades  de pointes  (as listed  in Appendix  E). 
• Concomitant use of C YP3A4 inhibitors with romidepsin should be avoided 
(excluding  anti-emetics)  to prevent  potential  increase in romidepsin  
exposure  during  concomitant  treatment  with these  drugs.  Should  a patient  
already  enrolled  on this study  require  treatment  with a drug listed  in 
Appendix  F romidepsin  must  be interrupted  prior to starting  these  drugs  
and should  not resume  until a washout  period  of at least [ADDRESS_980351]  the potential  to alter serum  electrolytes  (e.g.,  diuretics)  
should  be monitored  very closely  for electrolyte  abnormalities  as these  can 
contribute  to the risk of QTc/QTf  prolongation  and ventricular  arrhythmias.

9.5 Dose  Continuation,  Modification  and Interruption  
Subjects  will be evaluated  for AEs at each  visit with the NCI CTCAE  v4.0 used  as 
a guide  for the grading  of severity.  DLTs  as defined will be tabulated  in cycle  1 of 
phase  Ib and cycles  1-4 of the phase  IIa portion  of the study.  The toxicity  decision  
rule for the IIa portion  is described  in Section  14.0.  The sections  below  describe  
dose  reduction  steps, instructions for initiation  of a new cycle  of therapy  and dose  
modifications  during a cycle  of therapy.  Of note,  if patient‟s  experiences  a greater  
than 10% change  in body  weight,  dose  of romidepsin  should  be adjusted  
accordingly.  Doses  do not need  to be adjusted  for less than 10% changes  in body  
weight.  
 
9.5.1  Instructions  for Dose  Modifications  or Interruption  During  Phase  1 
Cycle  1 
There  will be no dose  reductions  in cycle  1 phase  1. Inability  to meet  treatment  
criteria  will result  in holding  the dose.  
 
9.5.2  Instructions  for Dose  Modifications  or Interruption  During  Phase  1 
Cycle  2 and beyond  and phase  2 all cycles  
Dose  delay  and dose  reduction  rulesare  as follows  and in the table  below.  The 
following  dose  modification  criteria  are applicable  to adverse  events  related  to 
study  drugs:  
• In the event  of dose  reduction  due to toxicity  all agents  will be reduced  as per 
Table  2, 3, 4. If an agent  is already  at its lowest  dose  per tables  2,3,[ADDRESS_980352]  
will be removed  from the study.  
• For treatment  interruptions during  a cycle,  the 21-day schedule  of each  cycle  
will continue  to be followed.  Missed  doses  of lenalidomide,  carfilzomib  and 
romidepsin  are not made  up. For treatment  interruptions that delay  the 
scheduled  start of a new cycle,  when  toxicity  has resolved  as required  to allow  
the start of a new cycle,  the restart  day of therapy  becomes  Day 1 of the next 
cycle.  
• If a patient  is at the lowest  dose  level and deriving benefit  from therapy,  they 
may continue on protocol  therapy  despi[INVESTIGATOR_040]  ≥ grade  3 hematologic  toxicity  or 
non-clinically  significant  non-hematologic  toxicity  after discussion  with the MSK  
principal investigator.  A delay  of planned  study  therapy  of greater  than 21 days  
with result  in removal  from study.

9.7.2  Anticoagulation  Consideration  
Lenalidomide  increases  the risk of thrombotic  events  in patients  who are at high 
risk or with a history  a thrombosis,  in particular  when  combined  with other  drugs  
known  to cause  thrombosis.  When  lenalidomide  was combined  with other  agents  
such  as steroids  (e.g. dexamethasone,  prednisone),  anthracyclines  (Doxil,  
Adriamycin)  and erythropoietin  the risk of thrombosis  is increased.  For information  
on the risk of venous  thromboembolism  with combined  oral contraceptio  n see 
Appendix  A: Risks  of Fetal  Exposure,  Pregnancy  Testing  Guidelines  and 
Acceptable  Birth  Control  Methods.  
Consideration  should  be given  to the optional  use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_27969]  n (81 or 325 mg) or 
some  other  form of prophylaxis  as deemed  appropriate.  Low molecular  weight  
heparin  may be utilized  in patients  that are intolerant to ASA.  Coumadin  should  be

10.4 Cardiac  Monitoring  
Minor  ECG  changes  are expected  following  romidepsin  administration  (refer  to 
current  Investigator ‟s Brochure).  Cardiac  assessments  must  be performed  for all 
study  patients.  The treating investigator  must  perform  the primary  assessment  
and is responsible  for the cardiac  safety  of the patients.  
10.5 Cardiac  Alert  Findings  
In the event  of an alert finding, the individual decision  about  a delay  of 
administration,  dose  reduction,  or withdrawal  from the study  will be made  by [CONTACT_3786]  (in association  with local cardiologist,  if preferred).  All alerts  must  be 
confirmed  via manual  read of the patients  ECG;  the machine  reading  alone  is not 
adequate.  The following findings are considered  to be cause  for alert and if they 
occur,  should  be reported  as AEs or SAEs,  as appropriate:  
• QTc or QTf is ≥ 500 msec:  
o Either  QTc or QTf formulas  can be used;  the lesser  of the two values  will 
be recorded.  
o If the patient  has a known  incomplete  or complete  right bundle  branch  
block  (RBBB)  or left bundle  branch  block  (LBBB)  a change  in QTc/QTf  of 
> [ADDRESS_980365] antiemetic  ECG  will be used  as criteria  for and 
adverse  event  and would  be graded  as a grade  3 adverse  event.  
o If the patient  has a single  or dual chamber  pacemaker  a change  in 
QTc/QTf  of > [ADDRESS_980366] antiemetic  ECG  in either  the native 
rhythm  or paced  rhythm  will be used  as a criteria  for an adverse  event  
and would  be graded  as a grade  3 adverse  event.  
• Ventricular  arrhythmia:  VT (≥ 3 beats  in a row) or VF. 
• Sinus  tachycardia  (pulse  >140/min  after recumbency).  
• Heart  rate is > 120 bpm with > 20 bpm increase  from previous  evaluation.  
• New occurrence  of atrial  dysrhythmias  (SVT,  atrial  fibrillation,  or atrial  flutter).  
• Abnormal  ST and/or  T-wave  changes  includi ng ST depression  of  2 mm (as 
measured  from isoelectric  line to the ST segment  at a point  60 msec  at the end 
of the QRS complex);  T-wave  inversion of  4 mm (measured  from isoelectric  
line to peak  of T-wave)  as long as the main  QRS  vector  is positive  . 
• Ventricular  tachycardia,  including  Torsade  de Pointes.  
See Table  [ADDRESS_980367]  be performed  within 1 hour (after  administration of antiemetic  
premedication)  prior to romidepsin  and after completion  of each  romidepsin  
infusion  for cycles  1 and 2. If no QTc/QTf  value  greater  than 480 msec  is 
demonstrated  by [CONTACT_331437]-read or manual  read then further  ECGs  may be omitted  for

the duration  of study.  If a QTc/QTf  value  greater  than [ADDRESS_980368] dose  of each  subsequent  cycle.  
 
If a QTc/QTf  is ≥ 500 msec  is encountered, ECGs  should  be repeated  twice  more  
for a mean  of three  QTc/QTf values.  If the mean  is > 500 msec,  follow  dose  
modification  guidelines  in table  6. 
Note  to Investigators:  At the Investigator ‟s discretion,  more  intensive ECG  
monitoring can be performed  for all romidepsin  administrations.  
10.7 Pregnancy  Testing  
Pregnancy  tests  for females  of childbearing  potential.  A female  of chi ldbearing  
potential  (FCBP)  is a sexually  mature  female  who: 1) has not undergone  a 
hysterectomy  or bilateral  oophorectomy;  or 2) has not been  naturally  
postmenopausal  for at least 24 consecutive  months  (i.e. has had menses  at any 
time in the preceding  24 consecuti  ve months).  
 
Pregnancy  tests will be required  by [CONTACT_718548]®  program  and will occur  
within 10 – 14 days  and again  within 24 hours  prior to prescribing  lenalidomide  for 
Cycle  1 (prescriptions  must  be filled within 7 days).  FCBP  with regular  or no 
menstruation  must  have  a pregnancy  test weekly  for the first 28 days  and then 
every  28 days while  on therapy  (including  breaks  in therapy);  at disconti  nuation  of 
lenalidomide  and at Day [ADDRESS_980369] 28 days  and 
then every  14 days  while  on therapy  (including breaks  in therapy),  at 
discontinuation  of lenalidomide  and at Day [ADDRESS_980370] dose  of 
lenalidomide  (see Appendix  A: Risks  of Fetal  Exposure,  Pregnancy  Testi ng 
Guidelines and Acceptable  Birth  Control  Methods).  
 
10.[ADDRESS_980371] dose  of protocol  therapy.  In 
addition,  off study  evaluations  per the end of study  assessments  will be done.

o Tumor  lysis syndrome  is caused  by [CONTACT_718549].  When  the tumor  cells die, they release  their contents  into the 
bloodstream.  If cell killing  is very rapid,  this can affect  blood  chemistries  
and the kidneys.  In severe  cases,  this can lead to shutdown  of kidney  
function  requiring  dialysis.

12.1 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
Response  and progression  of disease  will be evaluated  in this study  using  a 
modification  of the international criteria  proposed  by [CONTACT_718550]/CT.  [Cheson B, 2007].  The imaging  modality  for evaluation  will 
be dependent  on disease  subtype.  For aggressi  ve lymphomas  (e.g. DLBCL,  PTCL,  
HL), PET/CT  will be used  for evaluation  of response.  For indolent lymphomas,  CT 
alone  or PET/CT  may be used  at the discretion  of the treating  physician.  For CTCL,  
please  see Section  12.0.2.  
 
Measurable  disease: Measurable  lesions  are defined as those  that can be accurately  
measured  in at least one dimension  (longest  diameter  to be recorded)  as ≥ 15 mm 
with conventional  techniques  (PET,  CT, MRI, x-ray). All tumor  measurements  must  
be recorded  in millimeters  (or decimal  fractions  of centimeters).  
 
Non-measurable  disease:  All other  lesions  (or sites of disease),  includi ng small  
lesions  (longest  diameter  < 15 mm),  are considered  non-measurable  disease.  Bone  
lesions,   leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,   pleural/pericardial   effusions,   lymphoma

cutis/pulmonis,  inflammatory  breast  disease, abdominal  masses  (not followed  by [CONTACT_13191]), and cystic  lesions  are all non-measurable.  
 
 
12.1.1  Extracutaneous  Response  Criteria  
Response  criteria  will be based  on assessment  following 2 cycles  and subsequent  
assessments  will be made  every  3 cycles  thereafter  (e.g. after cycle  5, 8, 11 etc). The 
criteria  are as follows  (GTD  = Greatest  Transverse  Diameter;  SPD  = Sum of the 
Products  of the Greatest  Diameter):  
 
Complete  Remission  (CR):  
 
• No cli nical,  radiographic  or diagnostic  evidence  of disease.  
• No disease  related  symptoms.  
• Abnormal  biochemical  values   (e.g., LDH)  clearly  attributable   to  lymphoma  
must have normalized. 
• Lymph  nodes,  nodal  masses  regressed  to “normal”  size: 
• If > 1.5 cm before  treatment  regressed  to ≤ 1.5 cm in GTD.  
• If 1.1 to 1.5 cm before  treatment,  regressed  to ≤ 1 cm in GTD (or >75%  in 
SPD).  
• Spleen  and all previously  enlarged  organs  decreased  in size. Spleen  must  not 
be palpable  on exam  
• Bone  marrow free of disease  on repeat  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_718510]. 
• Normalization  of PET scan.  
 
Complete  Remission/unconfirmed  (CRU):  
 
Patients meeting the above criteria for CR with the following exceptions: 
• Residual  node  mass  of >1.5 cm in GTD regressed  by > 75% in SPD.  
• Individual nodes  previously  confluent  regressed  by >75%  in SPD 
• Indeterminate bone  marrow (increased  number  or si ze of lymphoid  aggregates  
without  cytologic  or architectural  atypia).  
 
Partial  Remission  (PR):  
• Greater  than or equal  to 50% decrease  in SPD  of the si x largest  dominant 
nodes/nodal  masses.  
• No increase  in size of other  nodes,  liver or spleen.  
• Splenic  and hepatic  nodes  regressed  at least 50% in SPD.  
• No new sites of disease.  
• Bone  marrow  and organs  other  than the spleen  and liver cannot  be 
considered  for evaluation  for PR because  involvement at these  sites is 
considered  evaluable  but not measurable.  
 
PET negative  Partial  Remission  (PET - PR): 
• Patient  meets  above  criteria  for PR with resolution  of previous  PET positive  
lesions.

Stable  Disease  (SD):  
• Patients  who have  achieved  less than a partial  remission  but who have  not 
developed  findings consistent  with progressive  disease.  
 
Progressive  Disease  (PD):  
• In patients  previously  CR, CRUCRU,  PR or SD. 
• Greater  than or equal  to 50% increase in SPD  of any previously  identified  
abnormal node.  
• Appearance  of any new lesion  during or at the end of therapy  
 
12.1.2  Cutaneous  T-cell Lymphoma  (CTCL)  Response  Criteria  
 
Dermatologic  responses  will be determined  by [CONTACT_718551] -Weighted  
Assessment  Tool (mSWAT),  a standardi  zed approach  to measuring the extent  and 
severity  of overall  skin disease  in patients  with CTCL.  It will be briefly  described  and 
full details  are provided  in Appendix  D. The purpose  of this description  is to optimize  
intra-observer  objectivity  and to minimize the potential  for intra-observer and inter- 
observer  variability  in the measurement  of overall  ski n disease. Only physicians  who 
received  training will be permitted  to conduct  mSWAT  assessments  during the 
clinical  study.  It is essential  that physicians  adhere  as closely  as possible  to the 
prescribed  procedures  so as to reduce  measurement  error  and variability.  All efficacy  
assessments  should  be performed  by [CONTACT_718552].  Physicians  will be instructed  not to examine  previous  mSWAT  assessments  
and full body  photographs  prior to conducting  the current  mSWAT  assessment.

If the previous  dose  level has been  administered  to only 3 patients,  an additional  3 
patients  will be enrolled  to confirm  the result.  For this design  the probab ility of 
escalation  is as follows:  
 
 
True toxicity  
rate 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 40% 50% 
Probability  of 
escalation  0.97 0.91 0.81 0.71 0.60 0.49 0.31 0.17 
 
Dose  escalation  will start with dose  level 1. A dose  level -1 is also added  to the 
design  to ensure  a minimum  level of toxicity  (we expect  this dose  level will be quite  
tolerable  for patients  based  on the phase  I data of romidepsin  and lenalidomide).  The 
maximum  number  of patients  needed  for this dose  escalation  design  is 30. We 
estimate  accrual  to be 2 patients  per month.  Patients  with measurable  disease  
treated  at MTD in the phase  Ib will be analyzed  in phase  IIa to further  characterize  
the toxicity  of carfilzomib,  romidepsin  and lenalidomide  in combination  at the MTD  
determined  by [CONTACT_718553]. In phase  IIa, we plan to enroll  patients  so that the total 
number  of patients  enrolled  in each  disease  type cohort  (B-cell lymphoma  and T-cell 
lymphoma)  will include  10 patients  at the MTD.  We estimate  accrual  to be 1 patient  
per month  in each  disease  type cohort.  To consecuti  vely monitor  the safety  primary

1“Life-threatening” means  that the subject  was at immediate  risk of death  at the time 
of the serious  adverse  event;  it does  not refer to a serious  adverse  event  that 
hypothetically  might  have  caused  death  if it were  more  severe.  
 
2“Persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity” means  that there  is a substantial  
disruption  of a person‟s  ability  to carry  out normal  life functions.

Adverse  Event  Definition  
 
An adverse  event  (“AE”) is any untowa rd medical  occurrence  in a Study  subject  
administered  an investigational Study  drug and that does  not necessarily  have  a 
causal  relationship  with this treatment.  An AE therefore  can be any unfavorable  and 
unintended  sign (including  laboratory  finding),  symptom  or disease  temporally  
associated  with participation  in a study, whether  or not considered  drug-related.  In 
addition  to new events,  any increase in the severity  or frequency  of a pre -existing  
condition  that occurs  after the subject signs  a consent  form for participation  is

reaction.  
 
A suspected  adverse  reaction  means  any adverse  event  for which  there  is a 
reasonable  possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse  event.  For the purposes  of 
expedited  safety  reporting,  „reasonable  possibility‟  means  there  is evidence  to 
suggest  a causal  relationship  between  the study  drug and the adverse  event.  An 
adverse  reaction  (AR) means  any adverse  event  caused  by a study  drug.  This means  
there  is reason  to conclude  that the study  drug caused  the event.  
 
An unexpected  AE is any AE, the specificity  or severity  of which  is not consistent  with 
the current  labeling  for the Study  drug.  „Unexpected ‟ also refers  to adverse  events  or 
suspected  adverse  reactions  that are mentioned  in the Investigator  Brochure  as 
occurri  ng with a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from the pharmacological  properties  
of the drug,  but are not specifically  mentioned  as occurri  ng with the particular  drug 
under  investigation. 
Adverse  Event  Reporting  
 
Toxicity  will be scored  using  CTCAE  Version  4.0 for toxicity  and adverse  event  
reporting.  A copy  of the CTCAE  Version  4.0 can be downloaded  from the CTEP  
homepage  (http://ctep  .info.nih.go  v).http ://c tep.i nfo.ni  h.go v). All appropriate  treatment  
areas  should  have  access  to a copy  of the CTCAE  version  4.0. All adverse  clinical  
experiences,  whether  observed  by [CONTACT_718565],  must  
be recorded,  with details  about  the duration  and intensity  of each  patient‟s  outcome.  
The investigator  must  evaluate  each  adverse  experience  for its relationship  to the 
test drug and for its seriousness.  Adverse  experiences  (AE) should  be defined with 
regards  to the toxicity  attribution  scale  as follows:  
• Unrelated:  The AE is clearly  not related  to the intervention. 
• Unlikely:  The AE is doubtfully  related  to the intervention.  
• Possible:  The AE may be related  to the intervention. 
• Probable:  The AE is likely  related  to the intervention.  
• Definite:  The AE is clearly  related  to the intervention.  
 
The investigator  must  appraise  all abnormal  laboratory  results  for their cli nical 
significance.   If any abnormal laboratory  result  is considered  cli nically  significant,  the 
investigator  must  provide  details  about  the action  taken  with respect  to the test drug 
and about  the patient‟s  outcome.  
 
AEs should  be reported  from the date of signed  consent  through  [ADDRESS_980383],  
acceptable  medical  terms.  The AE recorded  should  not be a procedure  or a cli nical 
measurement  (i.e., a laboratory  value  or vital sign)  but should  reflect  the reason  for 
the procedure  of the diagnosis  based  on the abnormal  measurement.  Further,  a

procedure  or surgery  is not itself  an AE; rather,  the event  leading  to the procedure  or 
surgery  is considered  an AE. 
 
If, in the Site Principal  Investigator ‟s judgment, a clinically  significant  worsening from 
baseline  is observed  in any laboratory  or other  test parameter  (e.g.,  
electroca rdiogram  “ECG”  or angiogram),  physical  exam  finding, or vital sign, a 
correspondi  ng clinical  AE should  be recorded.  If a specific  medical  diagnosis  has 
been  made,  then that diagnosis  should  be recorded.  For example,  if clinically  
significant  elevations  of liver function  tests are known  to be secondary  to hepatitis,  
“hepatitis”  and not “elevated  liver function  tests”  should  be recorded.  If the cause  is 
not known,  the abnormal  test or finding should  be recorded  as an AE, using  
appropriate  medical  terminology  (e.g.,  thrombocytopenia,  peripheral  edema,  QT 
prolongation).  
 
17.3.2  Pregnancies  and Lactation  Exposure  
Pregnancies  ,lactation  exposure  and suspected  pregnancies  (including  a positive  
pregnancy  test regardless  of age or disease  state)  of a female  subject  occurring  
while the subject  is on lenalidomide  and carfilzomib,  or within  [ADDRESS_980384] ‟s last dose  of the study  drugs,  are considered  immediately  reportable  events.  
Lenalidomide  and carfilzomib  are to be disconti  nued  immediately.  The pregnancy,  
suspected  pregnancy,  or positive  pregnancy  test must  be reported  to Celgene  Drug  
Safety  immediately  by [CONTACT_718566].  
The pregnancy,  lactation  exposure,  suspected  pregnancy,  or positi  ve pregnancy  test 
must  be reported  to Onyx  within  ten (10) calendar  days  by [CONTACT_718567].  The 
female  subject should  be referred  to an obstetrician -gynecologist,  preferably  one 
experienced  in reproducti  ve toxicity  for further  evaluation  and counseli  ng. 
The Investigator  will follow  the female  subject  until completion  of the pregnancy,  and 
must  notify  Celgene  Drug  Safety  and Onyx  immediately  about  the outcome  of the 
pregnancy  (either  normal  or abnormal  outcome)  usi ng the Pregnancy  Follow -up 
Report  Form.   If the outcome  of the pregnancy  was abnormal (e.g.,  spontaneous  or 
therapeutic  abortion),  the Investigator  should  report  the abnormal  outcome  as an AE. 
If the abnormal  outcome  meets  any of the serious  criteria,  it must  be reported  as an 
SAE to Celgene  Drug  Safety  and Onyx  immediately  by [CONTACT_6972],  or other  appropriate  
method, within  24 hours  of the Investigator ‟s knowledge  of the event  using  the SAE 
Report  Form.  
All neonatal  deaths  that occur  within  [ADDRESS_980385]  to causality,  as SAEs.  In addition,  any infant  death  after 28 days  that the 
Investigator  suspects  is related  to the in utero  exposure  to the IP should  also be 
reported  to Celgene  Drug  Safety  and Onyx  immediately  by [CONTACT_6972],  or other  
appropriate  method,  within  24 hours  of the Investigator‟s  knowledge  of the event

20.0 APPENDICES  
 
Appendix  A – Risks  of Fetal  Exposure,  Pregnancy  Testing  Guidelines  and Acceptable  
Birth  Control  Methods  
Risks  Associated  with Pregnancy  
 
The use of lenalidomide  in pregnant  females  and nursing  mothers  has not been  studied  nor 
has the effect  of the lenalidomide  on human  eggs  and sperm.  Lenalidomide  is structurally  
related  to thalidomide.  Thalidomide  is a known  human  teratogenic  acti ve substance  that 
causes  severe  life-threatening birth defects.  An embryofetal  development  study  in animals  
indicates  that lenalidomide  produced  malformations  in the offspring  of female  monkeys  who 
received  the drug during  pregnancy.  The teratogenic  effect  of lenalidomide  in humans  
cannot  be ruled  out. Therefore,  a risk minimization plan to prevent  pregnancy  must  be 
observed.  
All study  participants  must  be registered  into the mandatory  Revlimid  REMS™ , and be 
willing and able to comply  with the requirements  of REMS™. . 
Criteria  for females  of c hildbeari  ng pote ntial (FCBP)  
This protocol  defines a female  of childbea ring potential  as a sexually  mature  female  who: 1) 
has not undergone  a hysterectomy  or bilateral  oophorectomy  or 2) has not been  naturally  
postmenopausal  for at least  24 consecutive  months  (i.e., has had menses  at any time in the 
preceding  24 consecuti  ve months).  
The inves  tigator  must  e ns ure tha t: 
• Females  of childbearing  potential  comply  with the conditions  for pregnancy risk 
minimization,  including  confirmation  that she has an adequate  level of understanding  
• Females  NOT of childbearing  potential  acknowledge  that she understands  the 
hazards  and necessary  precautions  associated  with the use of lenalidomide  
• Male  patients  taking  lenalidomide  acknowledge  that he understands  that traces  of 
lenalidomide  have  been  found  in semen,  that he understands  the potential  
teratogenic  risk if engaged  in sexual  acti vity with a female  of childbearing  potential,  
and that he understands  the need  for the use of a condom  eve n if he has had a 
vasectomy,  if engaged  in sexual  activity  with a female  of childbea ring potential.  
Contraceptio  n 
Females  of childbea ring potential  (FCBP)  enrolled  in this protocol  must  agree  to use two 
reliable  forms  of contraception  simultaneously  or to practice  complete  absti  nence  from 
heterosexual  intercourse  during the following  time periods  related  to this study:  1) for at 
least 28 days  before  starting lenalidomide;  2) throughout  the entire  duration  of lenalidomide  
treatment;  3) during dose  interruptions; and 4) for at least 28 days  after lenalidomide  
discontinuation.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -179 A(6)  
Approval date: 12 -Dec-2017 
Administrative Update 1 : [ADDRESS_980398]  include  one highly  effecti  ve method  and 
one additional  effective  (barrier)  method.  FCBP  must  be referred  to a qualified  provider  of 
contraceptive  methods  if needed.  The following  are examples  of highly  effecti  ve and 
additional  effecti  ve methods  of contraception:  
o Highly  effecti  ve methods:  
▪ Intrauterine  device  (IUD)  
▪ Hormonal  (birth  control  pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections,  implants)  
▪ Tubal  ligation  
▪ Partner ‟s vasectomy  
o Additional  effective  methods:  
▪ Male  condom  
▪ Diaphragm  
▪ Cervical  Cap 
Because  of the increased  risk of venous  thromboembolism  in patients  with multiple  
myeloma  taking  lenalidomide  and dexamethasone,  combined  oral contraceptive  pi[INVESTIGATOR_64807].  If a patient  is currently  usi ng combined  oral contraception  the patient  should  
switch  to one of the effective  method  listed  above.  The risk of venous  thromboembolism  
continues for 4−6 weeks  after discontinuing  combined  oral contraception.  The efficacy  of 
contraceptive  steroids  may be reduced  during  co-treatment  with dexamethasone.  
Implants  and levonorgestrel -releasing  intrauterine systems  are associated  with an increased  
risk of infection  at the time of insertion  and irregular  vaginal  bleeding.  Prophylactic  
antibiotics  should  be considered  particularly  in patients  with neutropenia.  
Pregna  nc y tes ting 
Medically  supervised  pregnancy  tests  with a minimum  sensitivity  of 50 mIU/mL  must  be 
performed  for females  of chi ldbearing  potential,  including females  of childbea ring potential  
who commit  to complete  absti  nence,  as outlined  below.  
Before  starting  lenalidomide  
Female  Patients:  
FCBP  must  have  two negative pregnancy  tests (sensitivity  of at least  50 mIU/mL)  prior to 
prescribing  lenalidomide.  The first pregnancy  test must  be performed  within  10-[ADDRESS_980399]  be performed  within  
24 hours  prior to prescribing  lenalidomide.  The patient  may not receive  lenalidomide  until 
the Investigator  has verified  that the results  of these  pregnancy  tests are negative.

Male  Patients : 
Must  agree  to practice  complete  abstinence  or agree  to use a condom  during  sexual  contact  
[CONTACT_718578],  during dose  interruptions  and for at least 28 days  following  
lenalidomide  disconti  nuation,  even  if he has undergone  a successful  vasectomy.  
During  study  participation  and for 28 days  following  lenalidomide  discontinuation  
Female  Patients:  
• FCBP  with regular  or no menstrual  cycles  must  agree  to have  pregnancy  tests 
weekly  for the first [ADDRESS_980400] 28 days  of lenalidomide  treatment,  including  dose  
interruptions,  and then every 14 days  throughout  the remaining duration  of 
lenalidomide  treatment,  including  dose  interruptions,  at lenalidomide  discontinuation,  
and at Day 14 and Day 28 following lenalidomide  disconti  nuation.  
• At each  visit, the Investigator  must  confirm  with the FCBP  that she is continui  ng to 
use two reliable  methods  of birth control  at each  visit during  the time that birth control  
is required.  
• If pregnancy  or a positive  pregnancy  test does  occur  in a study  patient,  lenalidomide  
must  be immediately  discontinued.  
• Pregnancy  testi ng and counseli  ng must  be performed  if a patient  misses  her period  
or if her pregnancy  test or her menstrual  bleeding is abnormal.  Lenalidomide  
treatment  must  be temporarily  discontinued  during  this evaluation.  
• Females  must  agree  to abstai  n from breastfeedi  ng during study  participation  and for 
at least  28 days  after lenalidomide  disconti  nuation.  
Male  Patients:  
• Must  practice  complete  abstinence  or use a condom  during sexual  contact  [CONTACT_718579],  during dose  interruptions  and for at least 28 days  following

Appendix  D – Grading  Scales  for modified  Severity -Weighted  Assessment  Tool  
mSWAT  
 
1. Total  Body  Surface  Area  (TBSA)  Involve  ment  b y Skin Disease  
The body  is divided  into 12 regions  with pre-assigned  %TBSA  based  on the burn 
literature.  The extent  of ski n disease  in each  region  is quantified  by [CONTACT_510561] ‟s palm  to measure  the %TBSA  involvement  within  region:  patient‟s  palm with 
4 fingers  (excluding  the thumb)  is 1% of TBSA.  Patient‟s  palm  without fingers  is 0.5%  
of TBSA.  The patient‟s  palm  with 4 fingers  is traced  on a transparency  sheet  at the 
baseline  visit, usi ng a permanent  marker  that will not rub off or smear. The 
transparency  of the patient‟s  palm  should be used  in all mSWAT  assessments  during 
the course  of the cli nical study.  The transparency  will be labeled  with the patient‟s  
study  ID number  kept in the patient‟s  study  fi le on site. Using  the baseli  ne visit 
transparency  of the patient‟s  palm , the investigator will measure  and record  on the 
electronic  case  report  form (Example  of table  from eCRF  is given  below)  the %TBSA  
for each  lesion  type within  each  of the 12 regions.  
 
2. Seve  rity Weighting  Factor  
The severity  weighting  factors  will be the following: 
1= patch  (flat erythema  or erythema  with mild infiltration) 
2=plaque  (elevated  erythema  or erythema  with moderate  infiltration) 
4= tumor  or ulceration  (erythema  with fissuri  ng, ulceration  or tumor)  
Patch  is defined  as abnormal skin not elevated  from normal  ski n. A 
plaque  is defined  as abnormal  skin elevated  from normal  skin by < 5 
mm. A plaque  elevated  ≥ 5 mm is a tumor.  
 
3. Calc ula ting Ski n Scores  
The sum of %TBSA  by [CONTACT_718580] %TBSA  from all regions  
affected  by [CONTACT_552601].  The sum of %TBSA  across  lesion  types  (patches,  plaques  and 
tumors)  within  each  region  cannot  exceed  the %TBSA for the region.  For example,  
the %TBSA  for the head  region  is 7%. The sum of %TBSA  across  lesion  types  from 
head  can only range  from 0-7%. The ski n score  subtotal  by [CONTACT_718581] %TBSA for patches from all regions by 1, sum of %TBS of 
plaques  from all regions  by 2, and the sum of %TBSA  of tumors  or ulcers  from all 
regions  by 4. The ski n score  total is derived from summing the skin score  subtotals   
for patches,  plaques  and tumors  or ulcers.  The ski n score  total is dimensionless  with 
a scale  of 0 to 400.

Responses  will be determined by [CONTACT_718582].  
Progression  of disease  while  on treatment  should  be confirmed  by a second  
assessment  1-4 weeks  later so that patients  who experience  a temporary  flare of 
disease  due to skin infection  or other  intercurrent  illnesses  are not removed  from the 
study  prematurely.

Appendix  F – Medications  That  May Inhibit  CYP3A4  
The following  table  presents  a list of drugs  that may inhibit  C YP3A4. As romidepsin  is 
predominately  metabolized by C YP3A4, inhibition of this enzyme  could  result  in elevated  
plasma  levels  or increased exposure  to romidepsin.  Romidepsin  may be administered  after 
a 5 half-life washout  period  elapses  following  the use of these  drugs.  Washout  period  is 
based  on roughly  5 half-lives and rounded  to a convenient  interval.

female  of childbearing  potential  (FCBP)  is a sexually  mature  female  who:  1) has not undergone  a hysterectomy  or 
bilateral  oophorectomy;  or 2) has not been  naturally  postmenopausal  for  at least  24 consecutive  months  (i.e., has 
had menses  at any time in the preceding  24 consecutive  months).  Pregnancy  tests  must  occur  within  10 – 14 days  
and again  within  24 hours  prior to prescribing  lenalidomide  for Cycle  1 (prescriptions  must  be filled within  7 days).  
FCBP  with regular  or no menstruation  must  have  a pregnancy  test weekly  for the fi rst 28 days  and then every  28 
days  while  on therapy  (including  breaks  in therapy);  at discontinuation  of lenalidomide  and at Day [ADDRESS_980407] 28 days  
and then every 14 days  while  on therapy   (including  breaks  in therapy),  at  discontinuation  of lenalidomide  and at 
Day [ADDRESS_980408] dose  of lenalidomide   (see  Appendix  C:  Risks  of Fetal   Exposure,   Pregnancy  
Testing  Guidelines  and Acceptable  Birth Control Meth  ods).  
5Lenalidomide  must  be prescribed  through  and in compliance  with the REMS™  program  of Celgene  Corporation.  
Prescriptions  must  be filled within  7 days.  Consideration  should  be given  to prescribing  lenalidomide  5 to 7 days  in 
advance  of Day 1 of each  cycle  to allow  time for required  patient  and prescriber  surveys,  and drug shipment  to 
patient.  Any unused  Revlimid®  (lenalidomide)  should  be returned  to Biologics  for disposal  in accordance  with the 
REMS™  program.  
6Baseline  disease  assessments  must  be performed  after discontinuation  of most  recent  anti-cancer   therapy  
including  systemic  steroids.   Outside  scans  are acceptable  if performed  within  28 days.  
7 The imaging  modality  for evaluation  will be dependent  on disease  subtype.  For aggressi  ve lymphomas  (e.g. 
DLBCL,  PTCL,  HL), PET/  CT will be used  for evaluation  of response.  For indolent  lymphomas,  CT alone  or PET/CT  
may be used  at the discretion  of the treating  physician.  A bone  marrow  will only be repeated  to confirm  a complete  
response  if previously  known  to be involved.  Cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma  patients  (CTCL)  will have  an mSWAT  
(Appendix  D) performed  at these  time points  and imaging  at baseline.  In CTCL  patient ‟s, imaging  will be repeated  i f 
appropriate  (patients  with known  nodal  or visceral disease)  every  other  cycle.  Sezary  panel  in patients  with Sezary  
syndrome.  Cutaneous  lymphoma  patients  without  nodal  or visceral disease  will  have   imaging  repeated  only  to 
confirm  a complete  response.  
8 An additional  safety  assessment  will be done  28 days  (+/- 7 days)  following  the last dose  of protocol  therapy.  
9Response  assessment  will be performed  at the end of cycles  2. Thereafter,  response  assessment  will occur  at the 
end of every  third cycle  (5,8,11,  etc..)  until disease  progression  or removal  from study.  
10 +/- 3 days  
11if not performed  within  28 days  
12For cycle  3 and beyond,   laboratory  assessments  performed  up to three  days  prior to the day of treatment  are  
adequate  for treatment  as long as they are within  the treatment  parameters.

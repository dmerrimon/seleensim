Protocol_SDFPK051919CTG.docx 2 Purpose of the Study and Background 
 
Objective:  The purpose of this study is t o characterize basic PK parameters (C max, t1/2, 
AUC)  in healthy children  to contribute to evidence for the safety of Advantage Arrest , 
consistent with Guidance for Industry --Exposure --Response Relationships (April 2003).   
 Background:  The Sponsor/Investigator conducted a preliminary PK study in six adults 
(Vasquez et al., 2012) in which 38% diammine silver fluoride ( silver diamine fluoride ) 
was applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_873585]. Mean amount 
of the agent applied was 7.57 mg. Over the four -hour observation period the mean 
maximum serum concentrations were 1.86 umol/L for fluoride and 206 nmol/L for silver. These m aximums were reached at 3 h and 2.5  h for fluoride and silver, respectively. 
Fluoride exposure was below the EPA oral reference dose . Silver exposure exceeded 
the EPA oral reference dose for cumulative daily exposure over a lifetime, but for 
occasional use  was well below concentrations associated with toxicity. Nevertheless, 
the number of subjects was limited and the follow -up period too short to calculate the 
AUC. Although diammine silver fluoride  is available in many countries, there are no 
other published PK studies to our knowledge.  
The Sponsor/Investigator  conducted an additional PK study to further 
characterize the kinetics of silver and fluoride with sixteen healthy adults (Lin et al., 
2019) in which 38% silver diamine fluoride was applied top ically to five teeth in each 
subject  (estimated [ADDRESS_1220180]),  and maximum serum concentration and 
time to maximum serum concentration were studied via serum and urine samples over 
24 hours. Over the 24-hour observation period , the silver ser um peak was .67ng/mL. 
This maximum  was reached at 3 h , and the elimination half- life of silver was estimated 
to be 46 hours. Baseline fluoride serum levels were between less than 10 through 50ng/mL. The estimated urinary fluoride was 1.29mg, and no silver was recovered in 
the urine. The study duration was too short to fully capture the pharmacokinetics of silver and return of serum silver to baseline levels. A study duration of [ADDRESS_1220181] -applic ation. In both studies, there was a 400 -fold safety margin in 
the amo unt applied compared to the US EPA’s lowest allowable effect level for silver 
exposure at 1g.  
 There are no published PK studies with children . The investigative tea m at the 
University of Washington developed a  physiologically- based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) 
model to predict silver disposition in children , as there are data establishing the safety of 
fluoride exposure in children in both the anesthesia and dental literature . The predictive 
performance of the mod el was assessed by [CONTACT_873593]. The PBPK model was applied to the pediatric 
population by [CONTACT_873594].   From this model, 
the predicted silver concentrations were within 2 -fold of observed blood and tissue silver 
concentrations in rats and within the 95% confidence interval of observed plasma silver concentrations in health y human adults.  For a given SDF dose, the simulated peak 
plasma silver concentrations were 5.[ADDRESS_1220182] transiently higher silver plasma 
concentrations than adults, though smaller increases are expected if less SDF is 
applied.  
 Assumptions for Proposed Study: This is a topi[INVESTIGATOR_873586]. Minimal amounts are absorbed through the oral mucosa. Serum 
concentrations of silver and fluoride will be be proportional to the dose of silver and 
fluoride administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_873587].  
  
Criteria for Subject Selection 
 Number of subjects : There will be  up to [ADDRESS_1220183] 21  subjects to complete the study.  
Gender of subjects:  The subjects will be approximately half male and half female.  
Age of subjects:  Subjects will be 5 -12 years of age.  
Racial and Ethnic Origin : In a small study it is not po ssible to fully represent the 
racial/ethnic distribution of the region or US. The investigator will attempt to recruit a 
racial/ethnic diverse population.  
Inclusion criteria:  Subjects will be  healthy . Healthy status will be determined by [CONTACT_6270]-
reported medical history evaluated  by [CONTACT_873595].  Subjects will have at least 
one carious lesion .  
Exclusion criteria:  Subjects will be excluded if they have oral mucositis,  any ulcerative 
lesions,  or hypersensitivity to silver or fluo ride. Subjects with a history of SDF treatment 
within 3 months will be excluded .  
  
Methods and Procedures  
 Design of the Study and Minimization of Bias: Open label exposure --response study.  
 Randomization:  Not applicable . 
 Blinding:   Not applicable . 
 Baseline procedures:  Once informed consent  and assent  have been obtained, age, 
race, gender, and ethnicity information will be collected at baseline  along with a brief 
health history. A brief visual examination will be conducted to note any evidence of 
inflammatory or ulcerative changes to the gums or other oral tissues . Non-fluoride 
toothpaste will be used on the day of the base line appointment through the  blood draw 
period.  A blood sample of 6 mL (one tube  for serum collection ) will be withdrawn at an 
assigned time point using a fluoride free tube.

Protocol_SDFPK051919CTG.docx 4 Study intervention: Advantage Arrest, Aqueous Diamine Silver Fluoride [Ag(NH3)] 2F,  
CAS RN [ZIP_CODE]-28-7, 38.3% to 43.2% in purified water 5.0 - 5.9% (w/v) fluoride; 24.4 -
28.8% (w/v) silver, Silver Diamine Fluoride. 
 
Teeth will be brushed with a soft toothbrush to remove debris and dried with cotton prior 
to application. The specific procedure is 5 mg (1 drop) of Advantage Arrest will be 
dispensed into a plastic dappen dish and all of the material will be applied to the carious 
lesion/s with an applicator. To calculate the amount of Advantage Arrest applied: the 
dappen dish with the initial amount of Advantage Arrest dispensed and applicator will be 
weighed before application and after application. The amount applied will be calculated 
as the difference in weights before and after application. The amount applied will be 
recorded. The teeth will remain isolated with cotton rolls for [ADDRESS_1220184]. 
 
Blood sampling following intervention: Subjects will have one blood sample of 6 mL 
withdrawn at an assigned time point: 3 subjects per timepoint at 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, 96 and 
168 hrs. 
 Blood processing: Blood samples will be spun in a clinical centrifuge, the serum 
withdrawn, and then the serum will be frozen for later analysis.  
 
Sample Analysis: Serum samples will be analyzed for F
- by [CONTACT_873596] (Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). Cmax, Tmax, Cmin (last 
measurable time point), t1/2, and the AUC will be calculated from serum samples.

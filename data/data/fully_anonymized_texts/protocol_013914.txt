Purpose The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and effectiveness of 
the MiniMed 780G insulin pump used in combination withthe DS5
CGMin type 1 diabetes adult and pediatric subjects in a home setting.
Objective(s) The objective of this study is to e valuate the safety and effectiveness
of the MiniMed 780G insulin pump used in combination wit hthe DS5
CGM.
Study Design This study is a multi -center, single arm study in insulin -requiring adult 
and pediatric subjects with type 1 diabetes on the MiniMed 780G 
system using DS5as well as Medtronic Extended infusion set and 
reservoir .The run-in period andstudy period will be approximately 
120days long. 
The period from Visit 1 (consent and screening) through Visit [ADDRESS_750600] 
be completed in 30 days.
Run-in Period (Visits 2 -6): 
The run -in period begins at Visit 2 and ends once Visit 7 occurs.
The intent of the run -in period will be to allow subjects to become 
familiar with new study devices while using their own insulin : 
Humalog ™(insulin lispro injection) , NovoLog®(insulin aspart solution 
for injection) , or Admelog®(insulin lispro injection) . During the run -in 
period ,study subjects will be using the study pump with only the 
Sensor Augmented Pump (SAP) function activated (i.e. ,SmartGuard ™
feature is turned OFF) , DS5, Medtronic Extended infusion set and 
reservoir. 
SmartGuard (with Auto Correction OFF)during the run-in period will 
be permitted for study subjects who are using the Auto Mode feature 
in a Medtronic pump prior to screening. In the 780G study pump, the 
term “Auto Mode” has been replaced with “SmartGuard”. All others are 
to use the system in Manual Mode during the run -in period .

During the run -in period and only f or subjects with Auto Mode
experience through the use of a Medtronic insulin pump ,a 120 mg/dL 
Auto Basal target should be set. It is recommended that Active Insulin 
Time is set to 4hours.

CONFIDENTIAL 056-F275, Rev E Clinical Investigation Plan Template
Note: The Auto Basal target setting and Active Insulin Time should be 
set as recommended above ,unless there is a documented safety 
reason that would not permit these settings to be used.
Subjects who do not have experience with Medtronic insulin pumps, as 
specified above, will use the system in Manual Mode.
All subjects and their parents/ caregivers (if applicable )will be trained 
on diabetes ma nagement principles, such as the treatment of 
hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. In addition, there will be training 
regarding the need to have access to and how to use glucose and 
glucagon in case of hypoglycemia.  
Parents/caregivers (if applicable )will be instructed that they should be 
with the subject in the same residence or building overnight.
If the MiniMed Clinical app and the CareLink Clinical app are being 
used, parents/caregivers (if applicable )will be instructed that subjects 
should be c onnected to CareLink via the appropriate Smartphone app 
for data uploading and push notifications for low or high blood sugar 
when they are apart, e.g., at school, other activities. Instructions on 
the appropriate operation of the apps will be provided.
For study purposes, subjects and parents/ caregivers (if applicable) will 
be trained and/or instructed to perform self -monitoring of blood 
glucose ( SMBG )if subjects are experiencing a severe hypoglycemic 
event, severe hyperglycemic event or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 
Subjects and their parents/caregivers (if applicable) will also be 
instructed to check subject blood ketones using a Precision Xtra 
ketone meter or other approved ketone meter if the Accu-Chek Guide 
Link study meter reading is greater th an 300mg/dL.
As a precaution, subjects and their parents/caregivers (if applicable)
will be told that subjects should keep their own insulin pump supplies 
in a safe place and to have back up supplies on hand (such as insulin 
and syringe , or insulin pen ) in the event they are asked to revert back 
to their own therapy during the study or experience study pump issues 
(i.e.,infusion set occlusion with high glucose).  
Subjects and their parents/ caregivers (if applicable) will be instructed 
to insert the DS5into subjects only in the locations that are specified 
in the User Guide. Reminders will be given to subjects and their 
parents/caregivers (if applicable) at each office visit. Information 
about sensor insertions will be collected at each study visit on an 
electronic case report form (eCRF) in the study database, e.g.,
insertion location.
Subjects and their parents/caregivers (if applicable) will be trained on 
all parts of the device system. This will involve live training conducted 
CIP337 Clinical Investigation Plan Form
D00459337 Version A Page 11of [ADDRESS_750601]
and parents/caregivers (if applicable) will be implemented and
completed. Parents/caregivers (if applicable) should be available for 
relevant parts or all of this training, either in person or virtually .
After completion of training on the study devices, subjects and their 
parents/caregivers (if applicable) may attend additional visits in the 
days immediately following the start of system use, as needed. 
Study Period (Visits 7-15):
All subjects will continue using the study pump with SmartGuard
feature enabled (including Auto Correction) ,Humalog / NovoLog / 
Admelog ,DS5,infusion set and reservoir .During the study period, 
each subject will be encouraged to continue on the same brand of 
insulin with which they started .All SmartGuard ™features will be 
activated and should be used for the duration of the study period. 
Subjects should use the system with the SmartGuard feature turned 
on at all times. When prompted by [CONTACT_1709], subject s should take 
appropriate measures and follow directions on the pump to remain in 
or return to the SmartGuard feature. During times when subjects are 
not able to use the SmartGuard feature, they should use the system in 
Manual Mode (e.g. ,with Suspe nd before low orSuspend on low
activated ).

During the first 3 weeks ( between Visits 7 and 11 ) of the study period, 
a 120 mg/dL Auto Basal target should be set. It is recommended that 
Active Insulin Time is initially set to 4 hours and then titrated towards 
2-3 hours or at the investigator’s discretion.
During the next 3 weeks ( between Visits 11 and 13 ) of the study 
period, the Auto Basal target setting should be set to 100 mg/dL . 
Active Insulin Time is r ecommended to be set to 2-3 hours or at 
investigator’s discretion.
During the remaining weeks of the study (any time after Visit 13 ) of 
the study peri od, the A uto Basal target as well as Active Insulin T ime

Note: The Auto Basal target setting and Active Insulin Time should be 
set as recommended above ,unless there is a documented safety 
reason that would not permit these settings to be used.
After completion of live training on the SmartGuard function, subjects 
and their parents/caregivers (if applicable) may attend additional visits 
in the days immediately following the start of SmartGuard use, as 
needed. 
SMBG recommendations for 780G system:
Calibration is not required with the MiniMed 780G system using the 
DS5. However, a calibration is optional and itwill automatically occur 
any time a blood glucose ( BG)is entered. Occasionally, subjects may 
receive a notification if the pump needs a BG to enter or stay in the
SmartGuard feature . Subjects will be instructed to perform SMBG if 
their symptoms do not match the sensor glucose (SG)value (i.e. ,they 
develop symptoms of hypo glycemia or hyperglycemia, but the SG
value does not correlate with their symptoms). 
Sample Size and 
Investigational CentersA total of up to [ADDRESS_750603] 200 subjects enter the study period . Up 
to 125 subjects wil l be enrolled in the pediatric age group (7 -17 years

3.Introduction
3.1 Background
In patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, glycemic control is influenced by [CONTACT_571707], insulin absorption, timing, physiological/ lifestyle factors such as exercise, food 
intake, hormones and illness. These factors may contribute to significant variability in insulin 
requireme nts, which makes self -management of type 1 diabetes challenging.
Patients who are using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) , including sensor -augmented pump therapy, 
experience improvements in glycemic control. Advanced sensor -augmented insulin pump sare now being 
used in clinical practice includingclosed loop systems that automatic allyadjust the amount of insulin 
delivered to maintain glucose levels near the target value set by [CONTACT_28024] .1
The MiniMed 780G system is a closed loop insulin system.In addition to automatically adjusting the 
amount of insulin delivered based on sensor glucose (SG)readings while operating withtheSmartGuard 
feature activated , the MiniMed 780G insulin pump can also automatically deliver correction boluses when 
the system has been delivering at the maximum allowable basal rate and SGremains elevated. This 
pump is currently in commercial distribution in Europe and is under review by [CONTACT_286757] (FDA) . Previous clinical investigations involved the 670G Version 4.0 pump (contains 
the 780G Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop [AHCL] algorithm) used in combination with the Guardian Sensor 
(3) glucose sensor ,Guardian Link (3)transmitter , Humalog, and Novolog insulin . This investigation is 
intended to confirm safety and effectiveness of the 780G insulin pump used in combination with the DS5,
which combines the glucose sensor and transmitter into one disposable device . Additional details for non -
clinical/clinical testing are provided in the report of prior investigations.
3.2 Purpose
The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the MiniMed 780G insulin pump 
used in combination withthe DS5CGMin type 1 diabetes adult and pediatric subjects in a home setting.

5.Study Design
This study is a multi -center, single arm study in insulin -requiring adult and pediatric subjects with type 1 
diabetes on the MiniMed 780G system using DS5as well as Medtronic Extended infusion set and 
reservoir .The run-in period andstudy period will be approximately 120days long. 
The period from Visit 1 (consent and screening) through Visit [ADDRESS_750620] be completed in 30 days.
Run-in Period (Visits 2 -6): 
The run -in period begins at Visit 2 and ends once Visit 7 occurs.
The intent of the run -in period will be to allow subjects to become familiar with new study devices while 
using their own insulin : Humalog ™(insulin lispro injection) , NovoLog®(insulin aspart solution for 
injection) , or Admelog®(insulin lispro injection) . During the run -in period ,study subjects will be using the 
study pump with only the Sensor Augmented Pump (SAP) function activated (i.e. ,SmartGuard ™feature 
is turned OFF) , DS5, Medtronic Extended infusion set and reservoir . 
CIP337 Clinical Investigation Plan Form
D00459337 Version A Page 25of [ADDRESS_750621] (with Auto Correction OFF)during the run-in period will be permitted for study subjects who 
are using the Auto Mode feature in a Medtronic pump prior to screening. In the 780G study pump, the 
term “Auto Mode” has been replaced with “SmartGuard”. All others are to use the system in Manual Mode 
during the run -in period .

During the run -in period and only f or subjects with Auto Mode experience through the use of a Medtronic 
insulin pump ,a 120 mg/dL Auto Basal target should be set. It is recommended that Active Insulin Time is 
set to 4hours.
Note: The Auto Basal target setting and Active Insulin Time should be set as recommended above ,unless 
there is a documented safety reason that would not permit these settings to be used.
Subjects who do not have experience with Medtronic insulin pumps, as specified above, will use the 
system in Manual Mode.
All subjects and their parents/ caregivers (if applicable )will be trained on diabetes ma nagement 
principles, such as the treatment of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. In addition, there will be training 
regarding the need to have access to and how to use glucose and glucagon in case of hypoglycemia.  
Parents/caregivers (if applicable )will be instructed that they should be with the subject in the same 
residence or building overnight.
If the MiniMed Clinical app and the CareLink Clinical app are being used, parents/caregivers (if applicable )
will be instructed that subjects should be c onnected to CareLink via the appropriate Smartphone app for 
data uploading and push notifications for low or high blood sugar when they are apart, e.g., at school, 
other activities. Instructions on the appropriate operation of the apps will be provided.
For study purposes, subjects and parents/ caregivers (if applicable) will be trained and/or instructed to 
perform self -monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG )if subjects are experiencing a severe hypoglycemic 
event, severe hyperglycemic event or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Subjects and their parents/caregivers
(if applicable) will also be instructed to check subject blood ketones using a Precision Xtra ketone meter

or other approved ketone meter if the Accu-Chek Guide Link study meter reading is greater th an 300
mg/dL.
As a precaution, subjects and their parents/caregivers (if applicable) will be told that subjects should 
keep their own insulin pump supplies in a safe place and to have back up supplies on hand (such as 
insulin and syringe , or insulin pen ) in the event they are asked to revert back to their own therapy during 
the study or experience study pump issues (i.e. ,infusion set occlusion with high glucose).  
Subjects and their parents/ caregivers (if applicable) will be instructed to insert the DS5into subjects only 
in the locations that are specified in the User Guide. Reminders will be given to subjects and their 
parents/caregivers (if applicable) at each office visit. Information about sensor insertions will be collected 
at each study visit on an electronic case report form (eCRF) in the study database, e.g.,insertion 
location.
Subjects and their parents/caregivers (if applicable) will be trained on all parts of the device system. This 
will involve live training conducted by [CONTACT_571708] . A training checklist for both subject
and parents/caregivers (if applicable) will be implemented and completed. Parents/caregivers (if 
applicable) should be available for relevant parts or all of this training, either in person or virtually .
After completion of training on the study devices, subjects and their parents/caregivers (if applicable) 
may attend additional visits in the days immediately following the start of system use, as needed. 
Study Period (Visits 7-15):
All subjects will continue using the study pump with SmartGuard feature enabled (including Auto 
Correction), Humalog /NovoLog / Admelog ,DS5,infusion set and reservoir. During the study period, each 
subject will be encouraged to continue on the same brand of insulin with which they started .All 
SmartGuard ™features will be activated and should be used for the duration of the study period. 
Subjects should use the system with the SmartGuard feature turned on at all times. When prompted by 
[CONTACT_1709], subject sshould take appropriate measures and follow directions on the pump to remain in or 
return to the SmartGuard feature. During times when subjects are not able to use the SmartGuard 
feature, they should use the system in Manual Mode (e.g. ,with Suspe nd before low orSuspend on low
activated ).

should be set. It is recommended that Active Insulin Time is initially set to 4 hours and then titrated 
towards 2-3 hours or at the investigator’s discretion.
During the next 3 weeks ( between Visits 11 and 13 ) of the study period, the Auto Basal target setting 
should be set to 100 mg/dL . Active Insulin Time is r ecommended to be set to 2-3 hours or at 
investigator’s discretion.
During the remaining weeks of the study (any time after Visit 13 ) of the study peri od, the A uto Basal 
target as well as Active Insulin T ime should be set to what is best for the individual subject, at 
investigator ’sdiscretion.
Note: The Auto Basal target setting and Active Insulin Time should be set as recommended above ,unless 
there is a documented safety reason that would not permit these settings to be used.
After completion of live training on the SmartGuard function, subjects and their parents/caregivers (if 
applicable) may attend additional visits in the days immediately following the start of SmartGuard use, as 
needed. 
SMBG recommendations for 780G system:
Calibration is not required with the MiniMed 780G system using the DS5 . However, a calibration is 
optional and itwill automatically occur any time a blood glucose ( BG)is entered. Occasionally, subjects 
may receive a notification if the pump needs a BG to enter or stay in theSmartGuard feature . Subjects 
will be instructed to perform SMBG if their symptoms do not match the sensor glucose (SG)value (i.e. ,
they develop symptoms of hypo glycemia or hyperglycemia, but the SGvalue does not correlate with their 
symptoms).

6.4.1 Medtronic Extended Infusion Set 
Infusion sets are single -use by [CONTACT_571710]. The Medtronic Extended infusion set is an infusion set with a 
pre-loaded inserter, inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of a user , and is connected to a Medtronic 
Extended reservoir (for use with a Medtronic MiniMed insulin pump). There are three basic components 
of the infusion set: 
1.Catheter hub with cannula and adhesive patch
2.Tubing
3.Tubing connector
The cannula, connected to the catheter hub, is introduced into subcutaneous tissue (i.e. ,infusion site).  
The tubing connects the catheter hub and the tubing connector to provide the fluid from the medication 
reservoir housed within the insulin pump.
The device utilizes a new high -performance tubing connector (H -Cap) to replace the current proprietary 
Paradigm connector (P -Cap), an extended wear tubing to replace the current tubing, and an extended 
wear adhesive patch. Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate the device and the tubing connectors.

The [COMPANY_002] ’s Accu-Chek Guide Link meter is a home BGmeter designed to measure and transmit BG 
values to the compatible insulin pu mps via a Bluetooth Low Energy wireless communication protocol. The 
insulin pump then sends the BG values to the transmitter. The transmission of BG values from a 
compatible meter is an optional feature provided as a convenience to the user; it eliminates the need to 
manually enter BG values into the pump. The Accu -Chek Guide Link BGmeter is compatible with [COMPANY_002]’s
Accu-Chek Guide test strips. 
6.4.6 Accessory Applications –MiniMed 780G system
The MiniMed Clinical app is an optional accessory ,which receives pump data via Bluetooth Low Energy 
wireless communication from the pump. The MiniMed Clinical app provides users with the convenience to 
wirelessly transfer pump data to CareLink Personal/CareLink system software and also provides a

supporting documentation will be required .In addition, the subject will complete the questionnaires 
online via direct entry. In case the online link is unavailable ,subjects will complete the questionnaire 
using a paper format (this will be source data) and subsequently the investigator or designated 
investigational center staff will enter the responses online. If paper format is used, theinvestigator or 
designated investigational center staff should maintain the original paper source in the subject ’ssource 
file.
Electronic device data will be collected from the study pump using CareLink Personal/CareLink system
software. The system uses TLS technology, which encrypts all data it stores (21 CFR Part 11 compliant). 
Certain data points stored in the downloaded information may also be captured on the appropriate eCRF.
Electronic device data could also be collected by [CONTACT_571731].
The investigator will ensure that all eCRFs are completed promptly, completely, and accurately. Medtronic 
will provide detailed instructions to assist with eCRF completion. In the event of data discrepancies, 
investigational centers will be a sked to resolve queries electronically in the EDC system; otherwise, 
irresolvable data- related issues will be routed to the sponsor for review and final disposition. An audit trail 
is maintained in the EDCsystem to capture any corrections or changes of th e eCRFs. System backups for 
data stored in the EDCsystem will be consistent with Medtronic SOPs.
Medtronic will only consider eCRFs to be complete when all discrepancies between source data and eCRF 
have been resolved .eCRF content will be reviewed by a s tudy monitor , as described in the Monitoring 
Plan. In addition, specific eCRFs must also be reviewed and electronically signed by [CONTACT_093], 
indicating his/her agreement with the accuracy of all recorded data. It is expected that the investigator

9.7 Deviation Handling
A deviation is any instance(s) of failure to follow, intentionally or unintentionally, the requirements of the 
CIP. It is expected that the investigator will conduct this clinical trial in compliance with the CIP and all 
applicable regulations governing the conduct of clinical research involving human subjects. Failure to do 
so could result in one or all of the following:
Investigatio nal center disqualification 
Notification to the regulatory authorities/IRB depending on the severity of the deviation and 
reporting requirements
The investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes to, the CIP without agreement by 
[CONTACT_571732]/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_571691]
(if applicable) or IRB, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to subjects. The use 
of waivers from the CIP are prohibited in this study.
If there is a documented safety reason that would not permit the use of CIP defined Auto Basal target 
setting and Active Insulin Time settings ,then use of the alternative settings will not be considered a 
deviation.
9.7.1 Documenting Requirements for Study Deviations
[IP_ADDRESS] Unplanned CIP Deviations
The investigator may encounter the need to deviate from the CIP when necessary to protect the safety, 
rights or well -being of a subject in an emergency or in unforeseen situations beyond the investigator’s 
control (e.g., subject failure to attend scheduled follow -up visits, inadvertent loss of data due to 
computer malfunction, inability to perform required procedures due to subject illness).
Deviations from the CIP, regardless of the reason should be documented as soon as possible, after the 
deviation occurs or is identified. This documentation should include deviation date, description of the 
deviation, the reason for deviation, and the corrective action. Refer to Table 6 for reporting timelines for 
emergency deviations.  
CIP deviations should be reported as follows :
a)To the IRB for notification/acknowledgement;
b)To the sponsor and, if required;
c)To the applicable regulatory authority (reported by [CONTACT_3211]) .
9.7.[ADDRESS_750663] in an emergenc y. The date , description, and 
reason for each deviation will be documented (21 CFR 812.140 Records).  
The following examples are deviations that could impact subject safety, affect the integrity of study data 
and/or affect subject’s willingness to participate in the study. These deviations are significant and require 
immediate sponsor notification upon investigator awareness. : 
CIP337 Clinical Investigation Plan Form

Medtronic Business Restricted
CONFIDENTIAL 056-F275, Rev E Clinical Investigation Plan Template
Failure to obtain informed consent/assent, i.e., there is no documentation of consenting
Informed consent /assent obtained after initiation of study procedures
Continuation of a subject who did not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria
Performing study procedure not approved by [CONTACT_1201]
Failure to inform IRB and sponsor of reportable AEs (see Section 11)
Investigational study device dispensed without obtaining informed consent /assent
In the event the deviation involves a failure to obtain a subject’s consent, or is made to protect the life or 
physical well -being of a subject in an emergency, the deviation must be reported to the IRB as well as 
Medtronic within five (5) working days.
Reporting of all other study deviations should comply with:
IRB policies and/or
local la ws and/or
regulatory authority requirements
They must be reported to Medtronic as soon as possible upon the center becoming aware of the 
deviation. Refer to Investigator Reports, Table 6, for specific deviation reporting requirements and 
timeframes for reporting to Medtronic, IRB, and regulatory authority (if applicable).
9.7.3 Analyzing Deviations
Medtronic is responsible for revi ewing deviations, assessing their significance, and identifying any 
additional corrective and/or preventive actions ( e.g.,amend the CIP, conduct additional training, 
terminate the investigation). Repetitive or serious investigator compliance issues may re sult in initiation of 
a corrective action plan with the investigator and investigational center, and in some cases, necessitate 
suspending enrollment until the problem is resolved or ultimately terminating the investigator's 
participation in the study.

10.2 Risk Minimization
Refer to “Prevention and Mitigation” column in the table under Section 10.1.
10.[ADDRESS_750668] been minimized through previous characterization of 
the performance of the DS5 and a variety of safety checks that are an integral part of the MiniMed 780G 
closed loop algorithm .
10.5 Risk D etermination
In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021], this study is considered to be a significant risk (SR) study. Results of an
evaluation of the requirements per 21 CFR Part 812.3, led to the SR determination as follows:
The devices present potential for serious risk to subject health, safety ,or welfare.
The devices are for a use of substantial importance in treating disease, and presents potential for 
serious risk to subject health, safety ,or welfare.
Therefore, submission of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application to the [LOCATION_002] FDA
is required.
11. Adverse Events 
11.1 Adverse Events
Throughout the course of the study, investigational centers will make all efforts to remain alert to 
possible reportable adverse events (AEs) or untoward findings. The study personnel will elicit reports of 
CIP337 Clinical Investigation Plan Form
D00459337 Version A Page 65of [ADDRESS_750669] at each visit (including phone calls) starting at the time of signing the informed 
consent documenting the medical diagnosis, date of event start and end, causality (relationship to device 
or procedure), treatment, outcome, assessment of seriousness, and description that includes the details 
of the event.
11.2 Definitions and Classification of Adverse Events
Medtronic uses the definitions provided in ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2020 and 21 CFR 812 for AE definitions. Where the 
definition indicates “device”, it refers to any device used in the study. This m ight be the device under 
investigation, or any market released component of the system.
Severe Hypoglycemia is an event requiring assistance of another person due to altered consciousness
to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.
This means that the subject was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat himself 
or herself, was unable to verbalize his or her needs, and was incoherent, disoriented and/or combative.
These epi[INVESTIGATOR_27982]. Plasma 
glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable 
to the restorat ion of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was 
induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.2
Severe Hyperglycemia is defined as hyperglycemia ( BGgreater than [>] 300mg/dL or 16.7 mmol/L)
with BGketones greater than (>) 1.5 mmol/L, and/or accompanied by [CONTACT_96502], vomiting or 
abdominal pain.
The meter and ketone test strips are supplied for the evaluation of ketone monitoring. Only blood 
ketones will be recognized (not urine ketones) for assisting in diagnosis of severe hyperglycemia. The 
monitors/test strips are quality controlled prior to di spensing to subjects. Blood ketones provide 
contemporaneous understanding of ketone levels associated with elevations in glucose .
Diabetic Ketoacidosis/DKA diagnostic criteria : BGgreater than (>)250 mg/dL or greater than (>)
13.9 mmol/L, arterial pH le ss than (<) 7.3, bicarbonate less than (<) 15 mEq/L, moderate ketonuria or 
ketonemia and requiring treatment within a health care facility.3
Hyperglycemic events will be recorded as DKA if the event includes the presence of all of the following:
Arterial blood pH less than (<) 7.30 or serum bicarbonate less than (<) 15 mEq/L
Blood glucose greater than (>)250 mg/dL or greater than (>)13.9 mmol/L
Serum ketones or large/moderate urine ketones
Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting
Treatment provided in a health care facility

mental impairment
Note 1 to entry: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_305556], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event.
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) (ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2020)
Adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse 
event
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) (21 CFR 812.3(s))
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary pla n 
or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.
11.[ADDRESS_750670] is enrolled i n the clinical study. 
Each AE needs to be assessed for its device or procedure relatedness.  A device related AE is associated 
with the use of the study device ( e.g.,infection of sensor site or infusion set occlusion resulting in DKA). 
A procedure related AE is associated with testing related to the study procedures specified in the CIP 
(e.g.,needle (blood draw) insertion pain ).
Examples of device or procedure related AEs include:
Device related (ADE): insertion site infection
Serious adverse device effect : cellulitis at device insertion site requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
Procedure related AE: bruising at needle (blood draw) insertion site
Subjects participating in the study have diabetes and are expected to experience hypoglycemia and or 
hyperglycemia. These normal events are not expected to be reported to sponsor as this is not considered 
an untoward event, but rather an expected occurrenc e. Any glycemic excursion that meets the CIP
definition of severe hypoglycemia, severe hyperglycemia or DKA is considered an untoward event and a 
worsening from the subject’s baseline and would be reported to sponsor on an AE eCRF. 
CIP337 Clinical Investigation Plan Form
D00459337 Version A Page 68of [ADDRESS_750671]’s baseline.  For example, a subject previously diagnosed with asthma is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571694] a reportable event.
Adverse events will b e documented in the subject source file and reported to sponsor on an eCRF. The 
investigational center is responsible for documentation of AEs including obtaining source documents 
related to the event, such as emergency medical technician/paramedic reports , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] 
(admission summary; lab results, test results, discharge summary) or device uploads to support the 
event. Source documents will be reviewed to determine if additional AEs have occurred and require 
reporting.
Adverse events that have not resolved at the time of the subject’s discontinuation or completion of the 
study should have an “outcome” of Not Recovered/Not Resolved at study end in subject source and on 
an eCRF. The investigator should ensure that subject is aware of any follow -up or additional treatment 
that is required for any ongoing AE at EOSparticipation; however, there will be no eCRF entry for the 
ongoing follow -up.
11.4 Notification of Adverse Events
Sponsor Notification:
The investigational center staff must report all AEs to Medtronic in a timely manner. All severe 
hypoglycemia ,DKA, SAE, SADE , and UADE should be reported as soon as possible (desired within 24 
hours of investigator or study coordinator awareness) to Medtronic. For the previously mentioned 
events, the AE eCRF w ill be completed with all known details as soon as possible andthis will serve 
as notification to Medtronic. If the study database cannot be accessed due to technical problems, 
contact [CONTACT_571736] [EMAIL_10890] and provide the de-
identified known details of the event. Once the access issue has been corrected, the event should be 
entered onto an AE eCRF.
Source documents that support the event ( e.g.,clinic notes, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571695], lab reports, EMT reports, ER/Urgent Care) should be provided upon request to the sponsor 
via Medtronic ’ssecure upload application . All source documents/medical records should be redacted
of patient identifiers (full name, address, etc.) prior to providing to the sponsor. Each source page 
should be identified with the subject ID.
11.[ADDRESS_750672] 
learns of the event (812.150(a)(1)). See Section 12.[ADDRESS_750673] possibly caused the event and therefore is related to th e study device or 
procedure.
Causality assessment is the determination of the relationship between an AE and the device being 
studied.  It is expected that the investigational center will review all elements surrounding the AE to 
properly assess the causal ity of the event to the study device or to a study procedure. 
This review would include the subjects’ description of the event, study device uploads and medical 
records (if applicable) from the treating facility. These records will be made available to sp onsor. 
Investigators should classify the relationship between the AE and the study device or study procedures 
using one of the fourpossible causality categories listed below:
Not related: relationship to the device , comparator, or procedures can be excluded when:
othe event has no temporal relationship with the use of the investigational device or the 
procedures related to the application of the investigational device ;
othe event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible;
othe discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure –when clinically feasible –and reintroduction of its use (or increase 
of the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the event;
othe event involves a body -site or an organ not expected to be affected by [CONTACT_10398];
othe event can be attributed to another cause ( e.g.,an underlying or concurrent illness/ 
clinical condi tion, an effect of another device, drug, treatment or other risk factors);
othe event does not depend on a false result given by [CONTACT_5749], when applicable;
In order to establish the non -relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the 
same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the event.
Possible: the relationship with the use of the investigational device ,comparator, or the 
relationship with procedures, is weak but cannot be ruled out completely . Alternative causes are 
also possible ( e.g.,an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical condition or/and an effect of 
CIP337 Clinical Investigation Plan Form
D00459337 Version A Page 70of 97
Medtronic Business Restricted
CONFIDENTIAL 056-F275, Rev E Clinical Investigation Plan Template
another device, drug or treatment). Cases where relatedness cannot be assessed ,or no 
information has been obtained should al so be classified as possible.
Probable : the relationship with the use of the investigational device ,comparator , or the 
relationship with procedures, seems relevant and/or the event cannot reasonably be explained by 
[CONTACT_5748].
Causal relationship: the event is associated with the investigational device ,comparator ,or 
with procedures beyond reasonable doubt when:
othe event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of 
similar devices and procedures;
othe event has a temporal relationship with investigational device use/application or 
procedures;
othe event involves a body -site or organ that
the investigational device or procedures are applied to;
the investigational device or procedures have an effect on;
othe event fol lows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response 
pattern is previously known);
othe discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of 
activation/exposure), impact on the event (when clinically feasible);
oother possible causes ( e.g.,an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical condition or/and 
an effect of another device, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled out;
oharm to the subject is due to error in use;
othe event depends on a false result given by [CONTACT_5749], when applicable;
In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same 
time, depending o n the type of device/procedures and the event.
Example: A severe hyperglycemia AE with the following event description would have the

11.7 Anticipated or Unanticipated
If an AE is determined to be related to the study device the sponsor will then assess the event to 
determine if it is anticipated or unanticipated.
Anticipated :the event is identified in the CIP; labeling; report of priors/ Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB)or user guide.
Unanticipated: the event has not been previously identified in the CIP; labeling; report of 
priors/IB or user guide.
12. Data Review Committees
12.1 Clinical Events Committee 
A clinical events committee (CEC) consisting of external physicians with an expertise in endocrinology and 
the management of diabetes including insulin pumps and CGM will be convened. The CEC will review AEs 
as required per CIP, which include reports of:
Serious adverse event
Serious adverse device effect
Unanticipated adverse device effect
Severe hypoglycemia
Diabetic ketoacidosis
Severe hyperglycemia
During the study, the following steps will be taken for: 
Unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE)
Device related DKA 
Device related severe hypoglycemia 
CEC is to review and adjudicate the event within 10 business days from the time that the sponsor is 
notified. Adjudication will occur once all applicable documentation has been received and reviewed b y the 
CEC.
The CEC will assess events to determine agreement or disagreement with the investigator classification of 
an event. 
If the CEC disagrees with the investigator’s classification of the event, the rationale will be provided to 
the investigator. If the investigator agrees with the CEC’s adjudication, the CRF documenting the AE will 
be updated accordingly.

CONFIDENTIAL 056-F275, Rev E Clinical Investigation Plan Template
If the investigator does not agree with the CEC’s adjudication classification, both determinations will be 
provided within the final report; however, the CEC’s adjudication will be used for data analysis. The 
disagreement will also be included in reporting to IRBsand regulatory authorities, if required.
The CEC may review a pplicable information for device related AEs which may include:
Whether or not the event was unanticipated
Review of sensor data from CareLink Personal/CareLink system software report (when applicable)
Review of pump data from CareLink Personal/CareLink system software report (when applicable)
Misuse of the device by [CONTACT_571737]. Final disposition may be delayed based on 
obtaining th is information: 
Monitoring by [CONTACT_571738]
Device return and failure analysis
CareLink Personal/CareLink system software upload and review of software reports 
Subject clarification to investigational center regarding details about t he event
Source documents that support event: Paramedic records; ER records; Lab records; Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571696]’s recommendation to sponsor: 
1.Was the severe hypoglycemia or DKA related to the AHCL algorithm, or was it related to a known 
insulin pump risk? For example, a question that may be considered in DKA would be whether the 
event was related to an infusion set issue or caused by [CONTACT_571739]. 
2.Another important consideration would be if the severe hypoglycemia, severe hyperglycemia or 
DKA event was related to a device malfunction versus patient non -compliance. For example, if a 
software anomaly leading to an under -delivery of insulin is discovered versus the sub ject 
repeatedly ignoring alarms prompting the subject to take action.  
3.Severe hypoglycemia, severe hyperglycemia or DKA caused directly by [CONTACT_571740] a 
device malfunction might stop study enrollment or entire study altogether.
4.It should be noted that the final determination of causality related to 780G system that is made 
by [CONTACT_571741].

12.2 Data Monitoring Committee
A data monitoring committee (DMC) consisting of external physicians with an expertise in 
Endocrinolog y and the management of insulin -requiring diabetes including CGM, along with an 
external statistician will be convened to review study progress and safety. The Board will convene 
approximately every 90days. The Board will also meet when ad hoc review is r equired. 
The DMC will perform 3main functions: 
First: DMC will track and trend the overall safety of the study.    
Event rate, defined as number of events per [ADDRESS_750674] to the following:
Event rate of all SAEs  
Event rate of severe hypoglycemia
Event rate of severe hyperglycemia
Event rate of DKA
Event rate of device related AEs  
Second: Based on their meetings, DMC will recommend a decision to the sponsor regarding the 
following: 
Whether or not enrollment should be halted.
Whether or not the entire study will need to be stopped including for those subjects who have 
received study devices already. 
Note: If it is decided to withdraw subjects from participation in the study or if the study is stopped, 
subjects will be followed -up in accordance with standard practice by [CONTACT_571742] .
Third:
During the study, the following steps will be taken for:
Unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE)
Device related DKA 
Device related severe hypoglycemia
1.Investigational center staff will notify the sponsor within approximately 24 hours of investigator 
or study coordinator awareness of events described above.
2.Sponsor will notify the FDA within approximately 3 business days of awareness of the event and 
provide updates to the agency as information becomes available .
CIP337 Clinical Investigation Plan Form
D00459337 Version A Page 74of 97
Medtronic Business Restricted
CONFIDENTIAL 056-F275, Rev E Clinical Investigation Plan Template
3.DMC is to meet within 10 business days from CEC adjudication of the event . The investigator 
should be available to answer questions from DMC , as needed.
4.Based on their review ,DMC will recommend that the sponsor make a decision regarding the 
following: 
a)Whether or not subject enrollment may continue .
b)Whether or not new subject enrollment should be suspended, with enrolled subjects 
continuing in the study.
c)Whether or not the entire study should be stopped ,including those subjects who have 
already received study devices. 
5.DMC and/or IRB will recommend whether or not the study should be stopped based on the 
number of events that have occurred during the study, weighed against the potential benefits of 
continuing the study.
Note: If it is decided to withdraw subjects from participation in the study or if the study is stopped, 
subjects will be followed -up in accordance with standard practice by [CONTACT_571743] p roviders .
General guidance for DMC’s recommendations to sponsor should be based on the following:  
In general, a DMC recommendation regarding study stoppage or resumption of enrollment should be 
made to the sponsor within 1 week of the DMC meeting where the determination is made. However, if 
more data is needed, the DMC may meet again to re-assess their decision within 2 weeks or when 
required data becomes available.
In their recommendation to the sponsor, the DMC may take into account the thresholds listed below for 
the number of subjects experiencing hypoglycemia requiring assistance from another person or DKA to 
identify when the number of subjects experiencing these events exceeds the number that would be 
anticipated for the study population over t he duration of this study. These thresholds should be 
interpreted with caution due to potential differences in study populations and study design.
a.Rates taken from type 1 exchange (Cengiz et. Al, and Weinstock et. Al), are higher than 
the clinical studies STAR 3, 530G adult in -home study (CEP266) and 530G Pediatric in -
home study (CEP287).  
b.Reasons for lower rates of severe hypoglycemia and DKA in the clinical studies 
mentioned could be related to several factors including but not limited to the exclusion o f 
those with DKA or severe hypoglycemia, additional attention secondary to mandatory 
study visits, selection bias of motivated patients willing to perform study procedures and 
access to free study devices during the course of the study.
c.The DMC should cons ider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_571697] ( e.g.,higher) in AHCL than rates provided by [CONTACT_571744] 5 .  
d.Age consideration may also be factored in by [CONTACT_1363].  For example, severe 
hypoglycemia rates in those >25 years may be higher than those 25 years and below.

e.Should DKA and/or severe hypoglycemia occur early in the study, the DMC should 
consider that the higher event rate may not necessarily represent a significant safety 
concern.

13. Device Deficiencies and Troubleshooting
The Medtronic 24 -Hour Technical Support (TS) will be consulted for device troubleshooting (e.g.,
assistance is needed by [CONTACT_116686] [s]). When subjects call the TS, they are instructed 
to notify the TS operator that they are currently participating in a clinical research study. All DDsthat are 
reported to the TS will be documented by [CONTACT_502554].
The investigational center will be provided with a copy of all TS calls for their subjects. The TS call 
reports should be reviewed for investigational center staff awareness and assessment for the possibility 
of an AE. If an AE is detected the investigational center staff will complete the appropriate eCRF(s).
All DDsreported directly to the investigational center staff by a subject should either be reported to the 
TS by [CONTACT_502555]. Any DDthe investigational center may have should be 
reported to the TS. 
Device Deficiency (ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2020)
A device deficiency is any inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, 
reliability, usability, safety, or performance. 
Note 1to entry : Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors, and inadequacy in the information 
supplied by [CONTACT_143143]. 
Note 2to entry : This definition includes device deficiencies related to the investigational medical device 
or the comparator. 
To return a study device as part of a DD, the investigational center staff and/ or subject are required to 
call the [ADDRESS_750677] 
surveys/questionnaires ,and electronically by [CONTACT_571745]. Data and analysis will be 
summarized in a Clinical Study Report. Any deviations from original statistical plan and the rationale will 
be described in t he Clinical Study Report.
14.[ADDRESS_750678] characteristics, including age, gender, race, ethnicity, medical diagnosis, height, weight, BMI, and

15.4 Investigator’s Responsibilities
Per 21 CFR 56.102, an investigator means “an individual who actually conducts a clinical investigation 
(i.e., under whose immediate direction the test article is administered or dispensed to, or used involving, 
a subject) or, in the event of an investigati on conducted by a team of individuals, is the responsible 
leader of that team.” Each investigational center shall designate a primary investigator who will have 
overall responsibility for the conduct of the investigation at the investigational center .
The principal investigators (and co -investigators if applicable) are responsible for conducting the study in 
accordance with this CIP,CTA, and 21 CFR Part 812 that apply to significant risk (SR) device studies. The 
investigator’s responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
Conduct of investigation in accordance to draft guidance from FDA, “Protecting the Rights, 
Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects –Supervisory Responsibilities of Investigators”, to 
meet responsibilities with respect to protect human s ubjects and ensuring the integrity of the 
data from clinical investigations. This guidance is also intended to clarify FDA’s expectations 
concerning the investigator ’s responsibility:

12.4.1  Analysis of Primary Effectiveness Endpoint(s)  
The primary objective of this study is to demonst rate noninferiority in distance VA when 
wearing PRECISION1 contact [CONTACT_546255] 1-Day contact [CONTACT_13276]. The primary 
endpoint is distance VA with study lenses, collected for each eye in logMAR . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Statistical Hypotheses  
The null and alternative hyp otheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.05 
for noninferiority:  
H0: µ(T) – µ(C) ≥ 0.05  
Ha: µ(T) – µ(C) < 0.05  
where µ (T) and µ (C) denote the mean distance VA for PRECISION1  and Clariti  1-Day, 
respectively, on the logMAR scale.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis Methods  
A mixed effect repeated measures model will be utilized to test these hypotheses. The model 
will include terms for lens, visit, lens by [CONTACT_23259], period, and sequence. Within -
subject correlation due to eye and the crossover design  will also be accounted for in the 
model. Lens difference (PRECISION1 minus Clariti 1 -Day) and the corresponding one -sided 
95% upper confidence limit will be computed. Noninferiority in distance V A will be declared 
if upper confidence limit is less than 0. 05.

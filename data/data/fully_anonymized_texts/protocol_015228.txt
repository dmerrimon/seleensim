2. INTRODUCTION  
Head lice ( Pediculus humanus capi[INVESTIGATOR_17727] ) are parasitic insect s that can be found on the head,  of humans, 
particularly school age children. Head lice are tiny, wingless insects (2 -3 mm in length) which live among 
the warmth of human hair, usually close to the scalp, and feed from the blood in the scalp. They crawl  but 
cannot fly or hop. Although sm all, head lice can be seen with the naked eye . However, a magnifying glass 
may facilitate observation. When head lice bite the scalp to feed on the blood, it may cause itching; when 
lice crawl, it can cause a tickling /itching  sensation . Lice are also more active in the dark, disrupting the 
infested person’s sleep .  
Female lice lay 3 -5 eggs  (also called nits ) per day , which take [ADDRESS_342371] with clothing , worn by  [CONTACT_280709] , or with  personal item s (e.g., hair brushes, hair ties, towels, bed linens, etc.). Personal hygiene 
or cleanliness has nothing to do with getting lice. There is no evidence that lice prefer clean or dirty hair 
or whether the length of the hair increases the risk for being infes ted with lice. Head lice do not carry 
disease s, nor can they survive on non -humans  (e.g. pets do not transmit ). When removed  from the human 
host, head lice usually die within 24 hours. Also, when lice are in water, they become extremely inactive 
but remain  firmly attached to the hair. For this reason, lice are generally not transmitted in the swimming 
pool; however,  sharing the towel , used to dry the hair of the infested individual , may contribute to 
transmitting head lice.  
 
Head lice are very common; abou t 10% of the population are infested . From 6 to 12 million infestations 
occur in the [LOCATION_002] each year in children aged 3 to 12 years of age. It occurs more frequently in girls 
than boys. It occurs less frequently in African Americans than other race s; this might be explained by  [CONTACT_280710].

 Schulman IRB Protocol Approved Jan 23, 2018  
Diagnosis is made by [CONTACT_280711]/lice on the head of the infested individual. Generally, the 
person looking for live lice and/or nits should use a magnifying lamp.  The hair should be divided into small 
sections to facilitate dete ction . The areas around the top of the ears and at the neck line are the most 
common locations for nits  [1].  
Treatment is recommended if nits are found on the hair . The American Academy of Pedia trics 
recommends the use of Nix® (1% permethrin) with a second treatment applied [ADDRESS_342372] 
confirmed their mode of action, efficacy and safety [ 2-5].  
3. STUDY RATIONALE  
Treatment of hea d lice infestations remains a clinical relevant problem because of increasing resistance 
and safety co ncerns, observed with classic insecticidal pediculicides. For this reason, alternative 
treatments have been put on the market, relying on a physical mode of action. Some examples are 
dimethicone - and mineral oil -based products, of which clinical efficacy and safety has been extensively 
proven [2 -5]. Although very efficient, rinseability may be impaired, especially in products containing high 
molecular weigh t silicones. For this reason, Oystershell has developed a new water -dispersible , 
 head lice treatment (X92001666; Elimax Ultra®; further referred to as “test product”), combining 
high efficacy (as confirmed by [CONTACT_280712] o vicidal experiments) and improved rinseability 
(and thus user convenience). The test product is classified as medical device and elicits its effect  via a 
physical mode of action (more details are presented in chapter 4.1).  
The present study is set -up to c ompare in vivo  clinical performance and safety of the test product versus 
an in the US  commercially available, pyrethrum -based product (RID® shampoo ). According to US 
regulations, the rules for clinical trials with drug products  and the rules for clinical trials with medical 
devices must be followed. Before the trial can start, approval according to drug regu lation and medical -
device regulation must be granted. The study will be performed in subjects  ≥2 year of both genders with 
confirmed diagnosis of head lice infestation. To support safety, local and global tolerability, skin and ocular 
irritation  will be assessed and adverse events (AEs) will be registered.  
 
4. CHARACTERISTICS  INVESTIGATIONAL PROD UCTS   
4.1. Test product: X92001666  (Elimax Ultra®) 
The sponsor wi ll provide tes t product and the lice comb (OYS internal code: 070800 21), which will be 
incorporated in the final packaging. The site will be providing the Rid Shampoo.  The comb  will be used 
following application of either product.  The test product X920016 66 (Elimax Ultra ®) is a medical device 
for the treatment of head lice infestations.

Version # oys007 -0017 Jan 19, 2018 – [ADDRESS_342373] showed severe symptoms of dehydration 
(in house experiments). Because of its physical mode of action, no resistance is expected to occur.  
4.2. Reference product: RID® shampoo  
The active ingredient o f RID® shampoo, the reference product in this study, is pyrethrum extract 
(equivalent to 0.33% pyrethrins), combined with pi[INVESTIGATOR_280689] (4%). Pyrethrum has been used for 
centuries as an in secticide and as a lice remedy. This natural i nsecticide is mad e from dried flower heads, 
primarily of Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium. The main active ingredients are pyrethrins, also cinerins and 
jasmolins. Pyrethroids are synthetic, or man -made, versions of pyrethrins, one common example is 
permethrin. Pyrethrin is u sually combined or synergized with pi[INVESTIGATOR_280689]. Both chemicals act 
synergistically to kill lice by [CONTACT_280713]. The lice become paralyzed and die because they are unable  to breath.  
  
Pyrethrum has been extensively studied for its effects on people and the environment. Like all insecticides, 
pyrethrum is used to have a toxic effect on insects. Pyrethrum has a very good toxicity profile. [8]. For 
mammals, doses that elicit  toxic reactions are significantly larger than the exposures people typi[INVESTIGATOR_280690].  
  
On broken skin, pyrethrum produces irritation and sensitization, which is further aggravated by [CONTACT_280714]. Absorption of pyret hrum through the stomach and intestines and through the skin is slow [9]. 
However, humans can absorb pyrethrum more quickly through the lungs during respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Pyrethrum 
(as 100%) has an acute oral toxicity in rats of LD 50 3500 mg/kg and an acute skin to xicity in rabbits of LD 50 
[ZIP_CODE] mg/kg [10]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280689] (as 100%) has an acute oral toxicity in rats of LD 50 6150 mg/kg and 
an acute skin toxicity in rabbits of LD 50 1880 mg/kg.  
Response appears to depend on the pyrethrum compound used. Inhaling hi gh levels of pyrethrum may 
bring about asthmatic breathing, sneezing, nasal stuffiness, headache, nausea, lack of coordination, 
tremors, convulsions, facial flushing and swelling, and burning and itching sensations [ 10]. The lowest 
lethal oral dose of pyre thrum is 750 mg/kg for children and 1000 mg/kg for adults [ 11]. At high doses, 
pyrethrum can be damaging to the central nervous system and the immune system [12].  
  
Pyrethrins and their metabolites are not known to be stored in the body nor excreted in th e milk. The 
urine and feces of people given oral doses of pyrethrum contain chrysanthemumic acid and other 
metabolites [13]. In mammals, tissue accumulation has not been recorded.   
  
Overall, pyrethrins have low chronic toxicity to humans and the most com mon problems in humans have 
resulted from the allergenic properties of pyrethrum. Pyrethrum can produce skin irritation, itching,

 Schulman IRB Protocol Approved Jan 23, 2018  
pricking sensations and local burning sensations [10]. Pyrethrins appear to have low reproductive toxicity 
[14].   
5. OBJECTIVES  & ENDPOINTS  
5.1. Primary objective  
The primary objective  of this study is to demonstrate  that the cure rate after local application of test 
product is better than a predefined limit. The test product must achieve  a cure rate superior to 70% (at 
the end of day 1 0, corrected for re -infestation) .  
To compare  efficacy and safety  of test product  against  reference  product in subjects , infested with head 
lice ( Pediculus humanus capi[INVESTIGATOR_17727] ).  
5.2. Secondary objectives  
Secondary objectives refer to comparison of the cure rate of  test product with those of reference product 
using the following endpoints:  
Secondary efficacy objectives:  
a) To show that the cure rate at the end of day 10 (corrected for re -infestation) for the reference 
product for all baseline infestations is better tha n 70%.  
b) To show that the test product has a cure rate superior to that of the reference product.  
c) In case that superiority cannot be shown: to show that the test product is non -inferior to reference 
product regarding cure rate. A non -inferiority margin of 7. 5% will be used.  
Further secondary objectives refer to objectives c and d , however evaluated in subgroups or other time 
points.  
d) Efficacy of the investigational products for head lice for mild and moderate baseline infestations 
(cure rate at the end of the study day 10, corrected for re -infestation) . 
e) Efficacy of the investigational products for head lice for all baseline infestation s (cure rate at day 
1). 
f) Efficacy of the investigational products for head lice for mild and moderate baseline infestations 
(cure  rate at day 1) . 
As further secondary objectives, safety and tolerability of test product or reference as well as the 
acceptance of the investigational products will be evaluated.  
Secondary safety objectives;  
g) To evaluate local tolerability by [CONTACT_1130] : subj ective symptoms (burning, paraesthesia, pruritus): 
0h, 1h, 24h, 7d and 10d p.a. (descriptive evaluation).  
h) To evaluate global tolerability by [CONTACT_280715] (number of subjects with global 
tolerability ratings of “very good”, “good”, “moderate” , “poor”, descriptive evaluation) at 10d 
  
10 | P a g e

after application.  
 
i) To evaluate skin irritation by [CONTACT_464] (secondary infection, erythema, excoriation) on day 0, 1, 
7 and 10 . 
j) To evaluate eye irritation by [CONTACT_280716] 0, 1, 7 and 10 . 
k) To evaluate charac terization of safety and tolerability of the investigational products considering 
Adverse Events in the study population . 
 
5.3. Endpoints  
The primary endpoint  is the c ure rate at the end of day 10 (corrected for re -infestation) for the test product 
for all base line infestations.  
The secondary endpoint  is the difference of cure rates (as defined as primary endpoints)  between both 
treatments . 
 
Safety endpoints are the secondary characteristics of the lice infestation (see Section 9.4) and reported 
adverse events . 
 
6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1. Study Design  
This dual -centre, randomized , controlled , investigator -blinded , comparative study  will be conducted in 70 
subjects  (male and female subjects ; age >=2) with confirmed diagnosis of head lice infestation. All subjects  
will b e randomized in a 1:1 ratio in both treatment groups.  
In this study , a repeated treatment will be performed , as described in the literature . For two -treatment 
protocols, it is recommended that the second treatment should be applied on day 7 to day 8 and t he final 
assessment should be on day 10  [15].  In total, 4 visits are planned:  
Visit 1 – Baseline visit (Day 0 ; first treatment)  
Visit 2 – Post treatment evaluation v isit (Day 1: 24 hrs +/- 3 hrs.) 
Visit 3 – 2nd treatment visit/evaluation (Day 7  + 1 day ) 
Visit 4 – Final evaluation visit (Day 10 + 2 days)  
Subjects  complying with the in - and exclusion criteria will receive the study medication according to a 
subject  number, allocated in ascending or der in correspondence with their inclusion in to the study.  Both 
investigational products will be tested as described  in the product leaflets in compliance with the above -
mentioned treatment recommendations.

 Schulman IRB Protocol Approved Jan 23, 2018  
 
 
6.2. Screening/Treatment Day (Day 0) 
Subjects  with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_280691]. Written informed consent 
will be obtained from adult subjects  or the legal representative of minors. Children , must give their assent 
in written. The assent of younger children will be given verbally as far as appropriate. Subject ’s eligibility 
for participation in the trial will be established by [CONTACT_280717]. Screening 
assessments will include record ing of demographic data, medical history and current medication usage, 
an assessment of the head, scalp and eyes, vital signs, a nd a urine pregnancy test in females of child -
bearing potential. A subject must meet all inclusion criteria , and none of the exclusion criteria , to be 
eligible.   
Diagnosis of a head lice infestation will be confirmed by [CONTACT_280718]. The severity of the infestation will be judged on a 4 -point severity 
scale:  
• 0 = no relevant infestation (0 -4 lice and/or nymph present)  
• 1 = mild (5 -9 lice and/or nymphs present)  
• 2 = moderate (10 -24 lice and/or nymphs present)  
• 3 = severe (≥25 lice and/or nymphs present)  
 
Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive test product or reference product. 
Prior to the study , a block randomisation (block sizes of 2) will be  performed by [CONTACT_280719] (R version  3.4.2 ; R-development core team, 2017 ). The randomization schedule 
will be sen d to the site s prior to study conduct. All subjects will be enrolled into the study sequentially 
beginning with Subject Number [ADDRESS_342374] applied by [CONTACT_280720] a lice comb  (also see chapter 7). Date and times of 
start and end of application of the investig ational product and times of tolerability and efficacy 
assessments will be documented . Post -treatment assessments  will be performed  directly after start of 
treatment, as well as [ADDRESS_342375] of care i f they choose not to participate in the study. 
In addition, household memb ers will be advised to wash bed linens, towels, and brushes or combs used 
on the hair to prevent reinfestation.  
To sum up, at visit 1, the following operations will be performed and/or parameters controlled by [CONTACT_58860]:  
• Age-appropriate subject  information and obtaining of written informed consent  
• Documentation of demographic data  
• Documentation of medical history   
• Documentation of pre -existing or concomitant medication   
• Verifying of head lice infestation, incl. severity

• Checking of inclusion and  exclusion criteria including pregnancy test if applicable  
• Decision regarding study inclusion, randomisation  
• Baseline assessments (including local tolerability before treatment)  
• First application of the investigational product  
 
• Post -treatment assessment s (local tolerability, skin and eye irritation, adverse events) directly 
after start of treatment, as well as [ADDRESS_342376]  
• Questionnaire on the satisfaction with esthetical effect of the products  
  
After the assessmen ts, the subject  is released from the clinical ward and advised to follow the instructions 
/ restrictions made in the protocol and to come back on the next day for the second visit.   
6.3. Evaluation Visit ( 24 ± 3hours )  
24 hours (± 3h) after end of study drug a dministration , the subjects  will attend the study site. After the 
24-hour interval , the clinical evaluator  will perform the efficacy and tolerability assessments.   
These data, any concomitant medication taken during the study period, adverse events and an y change in 
concomitant diseases will be recorded in the Case Report Form ( CRF).  Therefore, at visit 2 the following 
operations will be performed:  
 
• Hair scalp assessment for living lice (all stages) by [CONTACT_464] (see chapter 9.4.8)  
• Assessments of skin and eyes irritation, local tolerability  
• Questioning on general well -being  
• Registration and documentation of any adverse event and/or changes regarding concomitant diseases, 
concomitant medication, withdrawal criteria  
• Vital signs  
  
In case that the exami nation of the hair and scalp (diagnostic combing ; see chapter 9.4.8 ) will show active 
head lice infestation, the life stage of the lice will be documented. Subject will not be removed from the 
study  and will continue until study end .  
 
6.4. Second Treatment ( Day 7 + 1 day)  
On study day 7 (+1 day) , the scalp and hair will be examined for live head lice by [CONTACT_17251]. The 
life stage of the lice will be documented. The assessments of skin and eyes irritation will be performed 
within 1h prior to administra tion. Subjects  without severe skin or eyes irritations will receive a second 
treatment with the assigned test product. The subjects  will be asked for any concomitant medication taken 
during the study period and adverse events that occurred.  
At visit 3 the  following operations are being performed by [CONTACT_3476]:  
• Hair scalp assessment for living lice (all stages) by [CONTACT_464] (see chapter 9.4.8)  
• Second application of the investigational products by [CONTACT_5984]   
• Assessments of skin and eyes irritat ion, local tolerability  
• Questioning on well -being  
• Registration and documentation of any adverse events and/or changes regarding concomitant 
diseases, concomitant medication, withdrawal criteria  
• Vital signs

6.5. Final evaluation v isit (Day 10 + 2 days ) 
The fi nal visit will be performed on stud y day 10 (+2 days). The final visit examination is performed to 
verify if the subject  is cured. A subject  will be considered cured, if no living head lice could be detected. If 
living lice present on day 10, the life stag es of the lice will be documented. If any other pediculicidal agents 
was employed during the observation period, the subject  will be considered a treatment failure  (no 
efficacy analysis will be performed) .  
The following examinations will be performed with in the final visit:  
• Hair scalp assessment for living lice (all stages) by [CONTACT_464] (see chapter 9.4.8)  
• Assessments of skin and eyes irritation, global tolerability, local tolerability  
• Questioning on well -being  
• Registration and documentation of any ad verse events and/or changes regarding concomitant 
diseases, concomitant medication, withdrawal criteria  
• Questionnaire on the satisfaction with the esthetical effect of the products  
• Vital signs  
  
In case that the examination (diagnostic combing) will show  active head lice infestation (living nymph or 
imago), the subject  will be considered treatment failure or re -infestation and will receive the standard of 
care at the site.   
Subjects exhibiting either subjective or objective abnormalities when the trial h as been completed will be 
followed up. Any AE which remains unresolved after completion of the trial requires detailed evaluation 
and follow -up until the AE has been resolved or a reasonable explanation for its persistence is found. If 
the subject refuses to follow the instructions of the study staff, the latter is released from responsibility.  
6.6. Restrictions  
• No parallel use of an y other anti -head lice therapy .  
• Subject agrees not to cut or chemically treat their hair while participating in the study  
• Female  subjects  are to be informed that they must  apply adequate contraceptive methods (e.g. 
uterine tube sterilization , sexual abstinence or vasectomized  partner or combination of anti -
conceptive medication and condom, spermicidal products, diaphragm, temperatu re method).  
• Subjects agree not to use any other anti -lice treatment for the duration of the study.  
6.7. Time and Events Table  
The actual date and time should be recorded for all procedures and the Investigator should make every 
effort to perform procedur es as required by [CONTACT_760].

• Short hair: 2 oz.  
• Shoulder -length: up to 3 oz.  
• Mid-back hair: [ADDRESS_342380] administration  / documentation  
Subjects will have the test product applied on the in itial visit by [CONTACT_280725]. The date and start time of the application of the test 
product will be recorded as well as the time the hair is considered dry. The Investigator, or their delegate, 
is responsible for study treatment accountability, reconcili ation, and record maintenance.  
The Investigator or their delegate must maintain study treatment accountability records throu ghout the 
course of the study. The responsible perso n(s) will document the amount of test product received from 
and returned to the sponsor and the amount supplied and/or administered to subjects. The required 
accountability unit for this study will be by [CONTACT_280726] (weight is to be recorded pre -appli cation and 
post -application to the su bject). Discrepancies are to be reconciled or resolved.   
The use and fate of investigational products must be documented. After completion of the study, the 
containers including any remaining investigational product wi ll be orderly destroyed by [CONTACT_90267]. 
A written explanation regarding the disposition of missing products or their containers is required.  
7.4. Assessment of Compliance  
Subjects are to be dosed at the study site; they will receive study treatment direct ly from the investigator 
or designee, under medical supervision.  The date and time of each dose administered/applied in the clinic 

  
17 | P a g e  
Version # oys007 -0017 Jan 19, 2018 – [ADDRESS_342381] and study participant identification 
will be confirmed a t the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff other than the person 
administering/applying the test product . 
7.5. Produc t – Instructions for Use  
In this study, the individual dose is chosen, according to the leaflet or the instruction of use .  
7.5.1.  Test p roduct (X92001666; Elimax Ultra®)  
The test product will be evenly dispensed (massage) in the hair over its full length,  with special diligence 
on the base of the hair near the scalp  (full saturation is essential). After 1 5 minutes without covering the 
hair, the hair is washed with Johnson’s Baby.  A deviation up to plus 2 minutes due to organizational  
reasons, particularly to deal with children’s ability to follow strict procedures , will be accepted. 
Consequently, the shampoo is rinsed thoroughly with a suf ficient amount of water. Afterwards, the hair 
will be towel -dried (no hair dryer), detangled with a normal comb and finally, combed with the lice comb . 
Hair is parted into three  sections and one section at a time is combed, starting at top of the head  and 
placing teeth to scalp as close as possible. The hair is combed 6x from th e scalp to the end of the hair. 
Following combing, hair and scalp are checked for head lice and nits.  
 
WARNING: Do not smoke during product use. Keep away treated hair from fire, fl ames and ignition 
sources.  
7.5.2.  Reference product (RID® shampoo)  
Subjects  with short hair will receive approximately 60 mL (2 oz.) , while subjects  with shoulder length -hair 
will receive up to 90 mL (3 oz.). Subjects  with shoulder length hair  from the subject’s  shoulder until the 
mid-back hair will be treated with about 120 mL (4 oz.) of the product. No more of the investigational 
products will be used, as necessary to properly cover the hair and scalp.  
The reference product will be evenly dispensed (massage) i n the hair over its full length, with spe cial 
diligence on the base of the hair near the scalp  (full saturation is essential) . After  10 (+ 2) minutes, warm 
water  is applied  to form a lather. Consequently, the hair is rinsed thoroughly to remove foam and re sidual 
product. Afterwards, the hair will be towel -dried (no hair dryer), detangled with a normal comb and finally, 
combed with the lice comb  6x. Place comb as close to scalp as possible and comb with a firm, even motion 
away from scalp, starting from the roots of the hair . 
The applied amount of both investigational products will be documented for each subject  in the CRF.  
WARNING: Do not smoke during product use. Keep away treated hair from fire, flames and ignition 
sources.  
 
8. STUDY POPULATION  
8.1. Number of Su bjects  
In total,  70 subjects ages 2+ years  and older will be enrolled in the study.  Based on previous clinical data 
with comparable head lice products, a power analysis has been performed.  Results indicated that a sample 
size of 35 subjects in each treatme nt group results in a power of 80% , considering a cure rate of 95% for 
  
18 | P a g e  
Version # oys007 -0017 Jan 19, 2018 – [ADDRESS_342382] and 55% for the reference product  and a superiority margin of 15% . In case of dropouts, 
subjects will not be replaced.  
8.2. Method of assigning volunteers to treatment grou ps / randomisation  
Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive test product or reference product. 
Randomisation will be performed during the screening visit V 1 on day 0. A block randomisation (block 
sizes of 2) will be performed by [CONTACT_280727] (R version 3.4.2 ; R 
development core team, 2017 ). The randomization schedule will be send to the site s prior to study 
conduct. All subjects will be enrolled into the study , sequentially beginning with  Subject Number 1 -70.   
8.3. Blinding  
As both products are substantially different from each other in terms of packaging, smell and application 
method, it is not possible to do a  double-blinded trial. Both, the subjects and the clinic personnel that will 
apply  the investigational products, will be able to recognize the products. Therefore, an investigator -
blinded study will be performed, and an independent assessor (investigator or study staff performing the 
assessments of hair and scalp, eyes, as well the effi cacy and safety evaluations) will be blinded to the 
treatment. Appropriate measures will be taken to keep the assessor blind during the whole study. The 
assessor will not be involved in any procedure of the trial involving the handling, storage, and use of  the 
products.   
8.4. Removal of volunteers from treatment or assessment  
8.4.1.  Withdrawal criteria  
• Serious Adverse Events (SAE’s)   
• Diseases requiring treatment that occur during the study, which do not constitute SAE’s but which, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_280695], would probably prevent achievement of the study objectives.  
• Non -adherence to the study conditions or relevant deviations from procedures as established in the 
study protocol.  
• Withdrawal of consent.  
• Duration of treatment < [ADDRESS_342383]  or < [ADDRESS_342384] .  
• Severe irritation of the skin or the eyes on pre -treatment assessment on day 7 .  
• Use of any other anti -head lice therapy.  
 
All details and reasons for removal of trial subjects from the study will be record ed in the study termination 
section of the Case Report Form ( CRF). CRFs of all trial subjects entered into the study must  be kept in the 
documentation of the study. Reasons for withdrawal of trial subjects will be entered into the final report 
of the study . Every effort must  be made to follow -up trial subjects who terminate with drug -related AE’s 
to determine the final outcome.  
8.4.2.  Follow -up of withdrawn subjects , drop ou ts  
A drop out is a subject , who prematurely discontinues participation after being enroll ed. If a subject  drops 
out, possible AE’s will be recorded as long as necessary. A post -study examination should be performed if 
possible.   
  
19 | P a g e  
Version # oys007 -0017 Jan 19, 2018 – 3 
 Schulman IRB Protocol Approved Jan 23, 2018  
All AE’s documented during the study for the drop out will be considered in the assessment. Other data 
recorded for  the drop out are contained in the individual subject  listing in an appendix to the study report.  
8.4.3.  Premature Termination of the study  
The sponsor has the right to close this study, and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_280696], 
at any t ime, although this can occur only after consultation between involved parties. The Independent 
Ethics Committee ( IEC) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) must be informed. If the study/centre had 
to be closed prematurely, the study centre will provide  all essential documents necessary for the sponsor’s 
trial master file (TMF), as defined in the GCP Note for Guidance.  
The trial will be terminated prematurely in the following cases:  
• If AE’s occur which are so serious that the risk -benefit ratio is not acceptable.  
• If the trial conduct (e.g. recruitment rate, drop -out rate, data quality, protocol compliance) does not 
suggest a proper completion of the trial within a reasonable time frame.  
8.4.4.  Replacements  
Subjects  who prematu rely discontinue participation will not be replaced.   
8.4.5.  Removal of volunteers from assessment Screening failures  
Screening failures are volunteers who were screened but not enrolled. Screening failures including reason 
will be listed in the screening list. All data obtained within the s creening will be documented in the 
subject ’s record. In case that entries were made to a CRF it will be archived, but not entered in the 
database. Screening failures will not be listed, as no CRF data is included in the database.  
8.5. Intention -to-treat (ITT) and Safety population  
The safety set/population consists of all subjects  who were randomised and exposed to study medication.  
The ITT population contains any subject included and randomized in the study , with available baseline 
value of the primary endpo int and at least one follow -up visit for the efficacy parameters.  
8.6. Eligibility Criteria  
8.6.1.  Inclusion Criteria

 Schulman IRB Protocol Approved Jan 23, 2018  
9.2. Demographic/Medical History Assessments  
The following demographic parameters will be captur ed: date of birth, gender, race, size of household, 
and hair characteristics (length, texture, and curliness).  Medical history and current medication usage will 
be assessed as related to the eligibility criteria listed in chapter 8.6. 
9.3. Efficacy   
9.3.1.  Assessment of Hair and Scalp  
An assessment of the hair and scalp will be performed  with nit c omb (dry combing)  to determine the 
number of live lice observed pre - and post -treatment  (Visits 1 to 4 ). An estimate of the number of 
apparently live nits will be made prior  to treatment only .  Each assessment will count the number of live 
lice and nits observed in the left, midd le, and right side of the head.  
 
9.4. Safety  
9.4.1.  Global tolerability assessment  
Global tolerability (general well -being and comfort of the subject ) will be a ssessed by [CONTACT_280730]/her guardian at day 10. The study staff will perform the rating in each case prior 
to the assessment by [CONTACT_280731]. Afterwards, the subject  will self -assess the global 
tolerability. Th e global tolerability will be rated on a 4 -category scale with:  
 
• Score 1 = very good  
• Score 2 = good  
• Score 3 = moderate  
• Score 4 = poor   
 
9.4.2.  Local tolerability assessment  
Subjective symptoms (burning, paraesthesia, pruritus) after administration of the inv estigational products 
will be rated by [CONTACT_280732] a 4 -category scale at day 0 (0h, 1h p.a.) and day 7 (0h, 1h p.a.) directly 
after study drug application, day 1 (24h), and day 10 p.a.:   
 
• Score 1 = no ne   
• Score 2 = mild  
• Score 3 = moderate  
• Score 4 = severe   
 
It will be investigated, whether the treatments have any influence on the above mentioned subjective 
symptoms.  
 
9.4.3.  Skin irritation assessment  
Skin irritation (secondary infection, erythema, pruritus, excoriation) will be assessed by [CONTACT_280733] [ADDRESS_342389] treatment (baseline), as well as directly after study drug

application and after the end of treatment on study day 0, day 1, day 7 (pre -treatment, 0h and 1h p.a.) 
and on day 10.  For the assessment of skin irritation,  the following 4 -category scale will be used:  
   
• Score 1 = no   
• Score 2 = mild  
• Score 3 = moderate

9.4.8.  Assessment of the hair a nd scalp ( diagnostic combing)  
An assessment of the hair and scalp will be performed to determine the number of live lice in the hair with 
a special lice comb (dry combing). The lice comb will be provided by [CONTACT_280735]  (OYS internal code: 
0708001 9).  
For this assessment , the hair will be divided into 3 sections: left, middle, and right side of the head. Each 
section will be combed 6x with a lice comb and the number of live lice encountered per section is recorded. 
The hair will be assessed for lice on day [ADDRESS_342392] complies with the inclusion criterion:

determinati on of re -infestation (see chapter 9.5 ). In case that the examination on day 1 , 2 , 7 or day 10 
will show active head lice infestation, the lice caught by [CONTACT_280736]. The subjects  with 
active head lice infestation on day 10 will be considere d a treatment failure and will receive an appropriate  
treatment.

is defined as:   
 
a) no adult lice or third stage nymphs present following the first treatment AND  
b) no more than two adult lice or third stage nymphs found by [CONTACT_280737] 10.   
c) Safety measurements  
9.5.1.  Specific safety measurements  
Due to the short treatment duration, the topi[INVESTIGATOR_78086] (associated with a low risk of systemic 
availability of pyrethrum) and com prehensive data on the safety profile of the active substance, special 
safety investigation s (e.g. laboratory safety tests) will not be performed. No further special safety 
investigations will be carried out during the study as sufficient information about  the investigational 
products is already available.  
9.5.2.  Checks for general well -being  
Checks for general well -being will be performed in a non -leading manner. In addition to the checks for 
general well -being at the first visit (0h, 1h p.a.), check s will also be performed, on study day 1 as well as 
on study day 7 (0h, 1h p.a.) and at the final visi t on study day 10.  
A registered physician will be available throughout the entire study and all subjects  will be observed for 
signs of clinical toxicity during the entire study.  
9.5.3.  Pre-treatment signs and symptoms and Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definition of pre -treat ment signs and symptoms and Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event (AE)  is any unintended or unfavorable  sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom 
or disease occurring in a subject after signing the informed consent until the last study visit, whether or 
not the event is believed to be causally related to study medication (IMP) or comparative compound. This 
definition includes any worsening of conditions that were present at the time of entry into the study 
(signing of the informed consent) (see International  Conference on Harmonization (ICH -E2A). AEs 
occurring after signing the informed consent but before administration of study medication are defined 
as non -treatment -emergent events. Those events are evaluated separately because in these cases a causal 
relat ionship with the study medication can be excluded.  
  
Adverse Drug Reaction: In the pre -approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new 
usages, particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established: all noxious and unintended 
responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered Adverse Drug Reactions. The 
phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product 
and an Adverse Event is at least a reasonable possi bility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
Regarding marketed medicinal products: a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which 
occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for modifica tion 
of physiological function (see the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting).

Version # oys007 -0017 Jan 19, 2018 – 3 
 Schulman IRB Protocol Approved Jan 23, 2018  
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction: An Adverse Drug Reaction, the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent wi th the applicable product information e.g. Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved 
investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an unapproved product 
or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved  product (see: ICH Guideline for 
Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting).  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) / Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (Serious ADR) is defined as any untoward 
medical occurrence that at any dose  results in death, or is life-threatening, or requires subject  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869] , or  results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, or  results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical re actions that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_280700].  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency unit or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
The term “life threatening ” in the definition refers to an event in which the subject  was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_280701] g at least one overnight stay. A requirement for out -
subject  treatment in an emergency room is not, by [CONTACT_5071], an SAE although the event requiring treatment 
may be. Elective surgery or other elective procedures which require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_280702]. However, any untoward outcome of any such procedure should be reported as 
a non -serious AE or an SAE, as appropriate.  
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity means that symptoms which disable the subject, defined 
as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions, do not resolve when study 
drug is discontinued. To ensure that there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between 
the terms “serious” and “severe”, which are not synonymous, the following should be considered: The 
term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mi ld, moderate, 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance 
(such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious”, which is based on subject / event outcome 
or action criteria usually as sociated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. 
Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Scientific and medical judgment should be used when deciding whether an event is seriou s. However, in 
situations where there is any uncertainty or ambiguity, the event should be managed and reported as if it 
were serious.  
  
Suspected Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction – S[LOCATION_003]R is an unexpected Serious Adverse Event causally 
at least possibly r elated to the investigational product. If a SAE will be classified as a S[LOCATION_003]R will be decided 
by [CONTACT_3211]’s drug safety department.

 Sponsor’s responsibility  
The sponsor should expedite the reporting to all concerned investigator(s) / i nstitution(s) and to the 
regulatory authority(ies) of all AE’s that are both serious and related. Such expedited reports should 
comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and with the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data 
Management: Definitions  and Standards for Expedited Reporting.  
9.6. Prior and concomitant therapy  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_280703], prior to the first intended administration of the investigational 
products, which is listed in the exclusion criteria (see section 8.6.1), will prevent inclusion into the study.  
Treatment of a previous anti -lice treatment with exception of combing the hair using a lice comb within 
[ADDRESS_342397]  should be continued throughout the study 
at a conventional dose and schedule. Their use is to be recorded in the CRF and medical records.

Version # oys007 -0017 Jan 19, 2018 – [ADDRESS_342398]  needs concom itant medication during the study, the responsible investigator should be asked. 
Concomitant medication is to be documented by [CONTACT_59584], type (generic name, if applicable), amount and 
duration on the CRF. The Principal Investigator / investigator will then de cide together with the 
responsible project manager of the study center , whether the subject  must  be excluded.  
9.6.1.  Concomitant treatment in the event of relevant AEs  
Depending on the severity and type of the AEs, the following treatments are suggested treatme nts and 
may be changed at the discretion of the responsible physician.  
Allergic reaction   
Treatment with best standard treatment option according to the local investigator’s site circumstances 
(e.g. antihistamines, glucocorticoids). The investigator will provide all the necessary emergency 
equipment at the study centre and specially trained staff to handle emergency events during this study 
(anaphylactic shock).

the following manner: the wrong CRF entry will be crossed out; however, it must remain legible, and the 
correct entry will be placed in the correction field (if applicab le) or next to the wrong entry. Corrections 
will be initialed  and dated.   
A sample CRF is provided in the Trial Master File. The originals are to be returned to the Sponsor. One 
copy will remain at the Investigator’s site. The CRFs for any subject leaving  the study should be completed 
at the time when study participation is terminated. CRFs should accurately reflect data contained in 
subject’s records (i.e. source documents).  
  
9.9. Clinical data management  
The data management department of the study centre  will create a database, which reflects the final 
version of the CRF. Upon receipt of CRF’s in data management, the information from the CRF’s will be 
entered in the validated database accordi ng to the corresponding SOP’s. Edit checks on completeness, 
correc tness, plausibility (such as range checks, cross -checks) will be performed. All identified discrepancies 
will be queried by [CONTACT_58047](s) using data discrepancy forms.   
The completed data discrepancy forms will become part of the CRF and, therefore,  the original data 
discrepancy form will be filed with the original CRF; copi[INVESTIGATOR_280704]. All changes to 
the database will be tracked (audit trail).   
Details on data management procedures will be fixed in a detailed data management p lan.  
10. DATA ANALYSIS AND ST ATISTICAL CONSIDERAT IONS  
Els Adriaens (Adriaens Consulting, Bellem, Belgium) will perform all statistical analyses.  
10.1. Sample size determination  
Based on previous clinical data with comparable head lice products, a power analysis ha s been performed.  
Results indicated that a sample size of 30 subjects in both treatment groups result in a power of 80%.   
10.2. Data Analysis Considerations  
Based on previous clinical data with comparable head lice products, a power analysis has been performed.  
In order to detect superiority (superiority margin of 15%) of the test product (cure rate of 95%) over the 
reference product (cure rate 55%) with a power of 80% at 5% level of significance, [ADDRESS_342401] deviation (SD), median, minimum and 
maximum. Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_22977].  
10.4. Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population, consisting  of all subjects who were  included 
and randomized in the study, with available baseline value of the primary endpoint and at least one follow -
up visit for the efficacy parameters.  All statistical test will be performed at a 5% level of significance.

10.4.1.  Analys is of primary objective  
The cure rate (p) corresponds to the proportion of subjects  who are cured at day [ADDRESS_342402] versus a predefined limit of 70%.  
The following null hypothesis will be tested:  
 H0, prim : pT - pR = 0 and H a: pT - pR > 15%  
A 2-test of independence will be used to test the null hypothesis .  
In case superiority could not be proven, non -inferiority will be test ed. According to ICH guideline “Points 
to consider on switching between superiority and non -inferiority” [ 17], it is allowed to assess non –
inferiority in to the absence of superiority. Prerequisites include:  
 
• predefiniti on of a non -inferiority margin  
• no corre ction in terms of multiplicity  
 
As non -inferiority margin (δ), a 7.5% worse cure rate is regarded as clinically not relevant. The following 
null hypothesis will be  used: H 0, NI: pT–pR < δ, whereby δ = -7.5%. The lower, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
of the difference p T-pR will be  used for  the test. If H 0, NI will be  rejected, non -inferiority cannot  be shown.  
10.5. Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will be performed in the Safety Population, including all enrolled subjects who 
administered the investigational product, independently of the duration  of treatment.   
Safety data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively. A 
comparison of the secondary characteristics of the lice infestation (see chapter 9.4) will be performed 
along with tabulation of the reported adverse events.  
 
10.6. Statistical software  
All statistical analyses will be performed with R -version 3. 4.2 (R development core team, 2017).  
10.7. Quality control for statistical procedures  
The statistical analys es will be conducted in compliance with the ICH E9 Not e for Guidance on Statistical 
Principles for Clinical Trials (CPMP/ICH/363/96, 1998). Quality control will include data check, calculations 
check, check of tables, listings, and figures. All steps of quality control will be documented with signature 
[CONTACT_280757].  
11. QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Quality assurance includes all activities undertaken during  and after a clinical study to verify and control 
quality. It embraces internal quality control by [CONTACT_280742] d separate auditing activities. All activities will be performed according to written 
procedures of the CROs and the facilities involved.  
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, the sponsor may  conduct a 
quality assurance audit.  Regulatory agencies may also conduct a regulatory inspection of this study.  Such

including GCP, and the sponsor procedures.  
In addition, the sponsor  reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this study 
at any time for reasons including, but not limited to, safety or ethical issues or severe non -compliance. If 
the sponsor determines such action is needed, the sponsor will dis cuss this with the investigator or the 
head of the medical institution (where applicable), including the reasons for taking such action. When 
feasible, the sponsor will provide advance notification to the investigator or the head of the medical 
institution , where applicable, of the impending action prior to it taking effect.  
If the study is suspended or prematurely discontinued for safety reasons, the sponsor will promptly inform 
investigators or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) and th e regulatory authorities of 
the suspension or premature discontinuation of the study and the reason(s) for the action. If required by 
[CONTACT_5279], the investigator or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) must 
inform the IRB/IEC  promptly and provide the reason for the suspension or premature discontinuation.  
11.3. Data Management  
The site or a data management partner will provide a file containing all the needed data to the statistician 
so the appropriate statistical analyses can be pe rformed. Subject data will be entered into case report 
forms (CRFs).  Subject initials will not be transmitted to the sponsor or data management partner.  Case 
Report Forms will be given to the sponsor, while the sites will retain a copy.  
12. ETHICS  
12.1. Independe nt Ethics Committee (IEC)   
The documents required by [CONTACT_11580] -GCP regulation, including study protocol, informed consent form as

reasons. Confidentiality and pseudonymity of the subje cts are assured. Children fro m 2-[ADDRESS_342405]  group are described below .  
 
As the minor is unable to provide legally binding consent, th e parent /s or legal guardian  has/have to give 
informed consent on his/her behal f prior to enrolling a minor in the trial. In case both parents are the legal 
guardian , it may be sufficient that at least one parent gives the informed consent .  
The parent(s)/ legal  guardian  will be given sufficient time and necessary information to consider the 
benefits and risks of involving the minor in the clinical trial. Information will be given by [CONTACT_280745](s), or the legal guardian  on the purpose of  the trial and its nature, the potential 
benefits and risks, and the name [CONTACT_280758](s) who are responsible for conducting the trial with 
background professional information (such as education, work experience) and direct contact [CONTACT_8972] 
(telephone, address, e -mail).  
There will not be financial inducement to enroll the minor in the trial; no financial incentive will be offered.  
Parent(s)/legal guardian  will be informed of the possibility to revoke informed consent even though it was 
made in writing .  
 
Parent(s)/legal  guardian will be reassured that the child’s treatment will not be prejudiced by [CONTACT_280746].  
  
Consent will be obtained from the parent(s)/legal guardian before assent is sought from the child.  
  
Parent(s)/legal  guardian  will be made aware of the rights to refuse participation in a clinical trial and are 
entitled to withdraw informed consent, without giving reasons.  
  
Parent(s)/legal  guardian  will be reassured that the withdrawal from the trial will not prejudice the ch ild. 
Legal representatives who gave informed consent for a child to participate in clinical trials will have the 
opportunity to follow research as it proceeds (unless clinically inappropriate, e.g., during an operation 
under general anesthesia), to be able  to withdraw the child from the research at any time.  
  
Minors will be involved in discussions and decision -making process only after obtaining consent from the 
parent(s) or the legal guardian as, where appropriate, the central role of parents should be recognized. 
An assent (age appropriate) in addition to informed consent of the legal guardian is required. If the child’s 
assent is not collected, this will be recorded in the consent form signed by [CONTACT_7903]/legal representative 
and investigator, with the reasons.

 Schulman IRB Protocol Approved Jan 23, 2018  
Consent and assent forms will be used to provide age appropriate information. Objections raised by a 
minor at any time during a trial will be considered. The child’s will is respected any time, provided it is not 
considered detrimental to his/her health. The child will not be forced to provide reasons. The legal 
guardian’s  consent should be checked. The child will be informed of the possibility to withdraw from the 
trial.  
12.3.2.  Infants and pre -school children  
In this age group, it is not possib le to obtain assent and the understanding of research is not expected.  
Where the child has some capacity of understanding (pre -school children), age -appropriate information 
will be provided even though it will not be possible to obtain assent.   
12.3.3.  Children o f school age (from about 6 years old)  
In any case assent, preferably in writing will be obtained when the child is able to read and write, and 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_280705].  
  
12.3.4.  Consent and assent in adolescents  
Additional informed consen t to participate in clinical trial is required for enrolment of minors of this age 
group.  
  
12.4. Informed consent (and assent for children) of families with different cultural  
background  
Where appropriate, a cultural mediator  independent from the sponsor and  investigator, experienced in 
the language, social habits, culture, traditions, religion and particular ethnic problems will assist in the 
process of obtaining informed consent and assent.   
12.5. Insurance  
All subjects participating in the study will have insu rance coverage by [CONTACT_456], which is in line with 
applicable laws and/or regulations. A copy of the insurance certificate must  be available at the study site.  
13. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
Neither the Investigator nor the Sponsor may modify the protocol without  prior written agreement with 
the other party. Changes in any part of the protocol must be documented in the Study Protocol 
Amendment. All amendments that would increase the risk to the subject or may alter the results of the 
study, i.e. increase of the nu mber of subjects, a day dose of study drugs, the age range of study subjects, 
addition of blood sample(s) or another procedure(s), must be re -submitted to the Institutional Ethics 
Committee and to regulatory authorities and must be approved before their im plementation.   
If an amendment to the Study Protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential risks to the 
subjects, a new subject’s consent to continued participation will be needed and approved as stated above.  
If the changes in Study Pro tocol involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial (e.g. change of 
monitor, telephone number), written approvals are necessary from Sponsor, but not from the Institutional 
Ethics Committee and the Regulatory Authorities before their imple mentation.

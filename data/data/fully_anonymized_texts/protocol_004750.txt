1. INTRODUCTION
Background
In the critically ill, traditional vital signs may be late indicators of compromised or inadequate oxygen delivery 
to the tissues, potentially delaying intervention and putting the patient at greater risk. The ability to monitor 
blood oxygenation early is critical. The pursuit of meas uring blood flow through the heart has resulted in the 
development of different techniques for its quantificat ion. The three main methodol ogies to measure cardiac 
output are the Fick method, dye dilu tion, and thermodilution techniques[9]. The Fick method is the “gold 
standard” for cardiac output determinations in adults and is based on the principles developed by [CONTACT_168367] 1870’s. Fick’s concept proposes that the uptake or release of a substance by [CONTACT_168368]. The Fick principle reflects the extraction of oxygen through the systemic circulation and is 
dependent on arterial and pulmonary arterial oxygen levels, hemoglobin and the maximum amount of oxygen 
consumption by [CONTACT_168369] a given period (VO2 max).  Thus, the Fick principle involves the blood oxygenation 
process through the lungs and oxygen delivery to the ti ssues, where it is added and removed by a flow limited 
mechanism.  By [CONTACT_168370] d by [CONTACT_33428], the total amount of blood needed to 
carry oxygen through the lungs could be calculated.  This value then reflects the output of the heart
[9].
An intermittent thermodilution method applies the Ste ward Hamilton indicator dilution principles, using
temperature change as the indicator. A known amount of  solution with a known temperature is injected into 
the right side of the circulation and continuously withdr awn and measured at a constant rate from the arterial 
side. This resultant curve is plotted against time and ca rdiac output is calculated using the Stewart-Hamilton 
Equation. This curve is similar to the one produced by  [CONTACT_168371]. A modified Stewart-
Hamilton equation is used to calculate the cardiac ou tput, taking into consideration the change in temperature 
as the indicator. Modifications include the measured temperature of the injectate and the patient’s blood
temperature, along with the specific gravity of the solution injected[9].
Minimally invasive technologies have been developed to  monitor CO. FloTrac is a minimally invasive solution 
for advanced hemodynamic monitoring that automatically calculates key flow parameters every 20 seconds. Continuous clarity provided by [CONTACT_168372]. In additi on to minimally invasive technologies, noninvasive 
technologies such as the ClearSight system offer proactive decision support to optimize perfusion. The ClearSight system provides advanced hemodynamic pa rameters and continuous noninvasive blood pressure 
(BP) from a finger cuff and extends the benefits of continuous hemodynamic monitoring to a broad patient 
population, including patients in whom an ar terial line would not typi[INVESTIGATOR_168334]
[10].
The Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is considered  the gold standard to validate new CO monitoring 
devices. The Swan-Ganz PAC consists of an intravenou s device placed in the pulmonary artery allowing 
measurement of cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressures [1]as well as cardiac filling pressures. Since its 
initial presentation by [CONTACT_168373] 1970 [2], several modifications were made on the initial catheter that allowed 
for intermittent monitoring of cardiac output, stroke vo lume (SV), systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and mixed 
venous saturation (SvO 2) [1,3]. Technology for cardiac output (CO) and blood volume measurements has been 
developed using existing central venous and peripheral arterial catheters (PAC), such that

transcardiopulmonary thermodilution of blood with a sm all saline bolus is detected with ultrasound sensors 
attached to an extracorporeal arteriovenous loop [4].  
There is an unmet need in the pediatric population, as th ere are currently no clinically practical, accurate or
precise methods for measuring cardiac output (CO).  During his research in 1920, Alfred Blalock, M.D., a pi[INVESTIGATOR_168335] “the repeated removal of blood is usually associated with a decline in the cardiac output from 30 to 50% below th e normal level before a marked diminution in the mean 
blood pressure occurs”
[4,5].  Even though it has been nearly [ADDRESS_196415] for hemodynamic monitoring of cardiovascular function in critically ill pediatric 
patients[6]. Cardiac output is measured very rarely in the pediatric population; however, it is vital for oxygen 
delivery.  In this population, the methods used for cardia c output monitoring continue to be a poor surrogate, 
not validated or inaccurate. Cardiac output measurem ent is an essential part of hemodynamic monitoring and 
management of all critically ill patients, including pediatric patients of all ages and sizes[7].  
The primary objective of the study is to assess Cardiac Output Monitoring in pediatric subjects by [CONTACT_168374], ClearSight system to intermittent thermodiluti on Swan-Ganz, in order to expand the indications of 
FloTrac, ClearSight and Swan-Ganz th ermodilution pulmonary artery catheter to the pediatric population [ADDRESS_196416] additional da ta on tissue oximetry. The ForeSight Elite Sensors provide 
the benefit of continually monitoring oxygen s aturation of tissue with accuracy and precision.

4. STUDY DESIGN
General Design
This study is an observational study in th e U.S. Up to 108 eligible Subjects will be enrolled at up to five (5) 
study sites. A subject will be considered enrolled in  the study once the subject has signed the informed 
consent and a Swan-Ganz thermodilution pulmonary artery  catheter has been deployed, a FloTrac has been 
connected, the ClearSight finger cuff has been attac hed or ForeSight Elite sensors have been placed . The Study 
ID will be a 6-digit number, the first three numbers will  identify the site, and the second set of numbers will 
identify the subject identification number. 
A Swan-Ganz catheter, FloTrac transducer, ClearSight finger cuff and ForeSight Elite sensors will be placed 
prior to the start of the catheterization procedure.  Intermittent cardiac output and other hemodynamic
parameters will be collected throughout the duration of the procedure and analyzed according to the Statistical Analysis Plan.
Data collected in this study will support in expanding the current indications of Swan-Ganz, FloTrac and 
ClearSight into the pediatric population.
This study will be conducted in a manner that is consiste nt with the applicable regu lations and in accordance 
with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

POGO Study
Study #2019-[ADDRESS_196422] be smaller than the minimum clinical difference δ, which is the value that is large enough to claim 
difference. 
The hypothesis for bias is:
  H0:  bias <- δ or bias >δ 
  H1: -δ≤ bias ≤δ 
H0 is the null hypothesis (i.e. the difference between matched pairs of CO values of the two systems is 
larger than δ), H1 is the alternative hypothesis (i.e. the di fference between matched pairs of CO values of 
the two systems is within the range of δ).  A meta-analysis conducted a comprehensive search of 21 
published medical literature to assess the accuracy and precision of minimally invasive CO monitoring 
systems used in children when compared with CO monitoring re ference methods [8]. Among the 21 
studies, 19 studies (90%) showed a bias range of -0.5  to 0.5 L/min. Based on these data, the clinical 
minimum difference δ was set at 0.5 L/min, i.e. bias is expected to be -0.5< bias < 0.5 l/min. This value is 
smaller in magnitude than the 0.8 l/min floor that the US FDA had previously considered for CO 
comparisons. The meta-analysis also shows that [ADDRESS_196423] deviation (SD) 
no more than 1.0 L/min.  
In this study eight repeated measurements (m=8 sub sample s) or sub sample sections will be taken during 
the cardiac catherization case, thus intra-cluster correlation ecoefficiency ICC is a factor to be considered 
in sample size estimation. Here ܥܥܫ=ఋೞమ

Assuming a true mean bias of 0.0 and a SD of 1.0 l/mi n in the cardiac output, the sample size required for 
δ=0.5, alpha=0.05, and power=90% to reject the null hy pothesis is 45, ignoring the ICC. After considering 
ICC for eight repeated measures (m=8), a sample size of 54 Subjects in needed. After considering a 34.5% 
rejection rate for hemodynamic instability, 10% lost  to follow-up rate and 6 Roll-in Subjects for the 
learning curve, a total of 102 (96 evaluable Pi[INVESTIGATOR_168339] 6 Roll-in Subjects) will be enrolled.
Adjusting for multiple comparisons, considering there  will be two target devices and a reference device 
pairs, simultaneously, 108 total Subjects will be enrolled in this study.
Sample size consideration for percent error
The Critchley and Critchley method of percent error (PE) calculation will be compared to 30%. The 
Precision will be considered as acceptable if PE is less than 30 %. 
The hypothesis for PE is a one-sided test: 
H0: PE > 30%
H1: PE ≤ 30% 
The sample size calculation for this hypothesis was based on the one-sided T-test. The desired outcome is 
to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level. Assuming a true mean of 30% and a conservative 
SD assumption of 70%, the sample size required fo r power=90% to reject the null hypothesis is 49. 
Because the study is designed with sub samples (repeat ed measurements) or sub sample sections (m= 8), 
ICC is a factor needing to be considered in the sa mple size estimation.  When eight repeated measures
(m=8) are performed, the SD=69.38%.  The corresponding sample size necessary is 49.
For PE, a sample size of n=60 will be used in the study design, after considering two pairwise 
comparisons between 2 devices with a reference device. In addition, after considering a 34.5% rejection 
rate for hemodynamic instability, 10% lost to follow-u p rate, 102 evaluable subjects will be targeted.  To 
account for the learning curve and 6 additional Roll -in Subjects will be enrolled, totaling 108 Subjects 
enrolled in the study.
Calculation of Cardiac Index (CI)
Adjusting cardiac output (CO) with study subject bo dy surface area (BSA) results in the derivation of 
cardiac index (CI). This adjustment for body surfac e area, in the study pediatric population (12 to 18 years 
old), will result in a smaller bias and percent error between test device and reference device. The standard 
deviation estimate will also be smaller, at the same sc ale, thus, the sample size estimate decreases.  
Sample size estimates for bias and perc ent error for CI is detailed in the SAP.

Intermittent Thermal Dilution Assessment(s)
Using the Swan-Ganz thermodilution pulmonary artery cath eter, two series of four (4) intermittent dilutions 
should be administered by [CONTACT_168383].  The dilution  curves are analyzed and 
averaged to give one (1) CO value.  
CO measured by [CONTACT_168384] l be simultaneously compa red with the CO measured 
by [CONTACT_168385]-Ganz catheter using the thermodilution  method. There will be 2 sets of 4 measurements 
recorded over a 30-second interval, during the Swan- Ganz thermodilution bolus injection. Those 4 
measurements will be pair-matched by [CONTACT_168386] s. The same number of 
measurements that will be recorded during the Swan-Ganz thermodilution will be recorded for the ClearSight and FloTrac devices.  The follow ing thermodilution procedure will be used:
A 10 ml sample of iced glucose solution (5%) will be  drawn through an iced injectate container (CO-SET+ or 
any other container that meets the requirements, as determined by [CONTACT_093]) and injected in a 
steady manner. Four TD CO determinations will output, preferably within 5 minutes.  From there, three values, will be averaged to obtain one single value. Ea ch thermodilution curve will be visually checked 
before acceptance. The dilution curve will be automati cally corrected for the temperature of the blood and 
of the injectate measured at the en trance of the catheter lumen. Valu es for temperatures will be stored 
together with the thermodilution values . The entire series of four thermodilution estimates will be rejected 
if, during an injection, the HemoSphere advanced mo nitor displays an alert signal, if the injectate 
temperature is above 10 °C, or when the curve of the di lution is abnormal. In case  of rejection, the entire 
series of four thermodilutions will be repeated.
Hemodynamics and respi[INVESTIGATOR_168342], since variability violates the 
assumption of stability that  is required for the TD technique.   Spon sor-instream review of the TD series will 
occur after each catheterization to determine if hemody namic variability occurred an d the site team will be 
retrained on the importance of conducting the TD technique during hemodynamic stability.

POGO Study
Study #2019-[ADDRESS_196431] been cleared by [CONTACT_168387].  The ClearSight technology has been cleared for use in adults with the EV1000 Monitor; however, it has not been cleared for use with the He moSphere advanced monitoring platform. 
The current risks identified for using these products do not outweigh the benefit the patient will receive.   
Furthermore, this study is: 
1) Being conducted on patients who are already planne d to receive an arterial line and a Swan Ganz 
catheter and the addition of FloTrac and ClearSight  do not add to the invasiveness of the study,
2) Being conducted on patients who are al ready planned to receive thermodilutions 
3) An observational study as oppose d to an interventional study
4) Not relying on the data obtained from th e FloTrac and ClearSight to treat patients
Collecting data does not introduce any new risks in relation to these products. Regarding the ClearSight 
Module used in the HemoSphere platform, thorough test ing has been performed to show that this system 
functions as intended. As such collectively , the risks do not outweigh the benefits.
  
BenefitsThere are no guaranteed benefits from a subject’s partic ipation in this study.  However, the ForeSight Elite 
Sensors are cleared for pediatric use and provide the benefit of continually monitoring oxygen saturation of tissue with accuracy and precision.  When desatu ration of tissue occurs , the following may occur:
xCognitive disfunction
xExtended time on mechanical ventilation
xExtra days spent in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168346] (ICU)
xIncreased post-operative nausea and vomiting

10. REPORTABLE EVENTS
Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
The Investigator and/or Designee(s) will determine wh ether any adverse events (AEs) have occurred.  An 
AE is defined as any untoward medica l occurrence in a clinical Study of an Investigational Device regardless 
of the causal relationship of the problem with the device or, if applicable, other Study treatment or 
diagnostic product(s).  Information for AEs with the study devices will be collected from the time a subject 
begins the study procedure and is ex posed to Study products.  AEs will also be collected during surgical 
intervention, post intervention, discharge and through the 30-day follow-up.  AEs may be volunteered by 
[CONTACT_1766], clinicians, elicited from questioning by [CONTACT_18615]/or Designee(s), or collected via 
observation.  When a device or study related AE is suspected all available event information and will be 
provided to the Clinical Events Committee. 
Once an AE/SAE/UADE is confirmed as such, event, date of onset, severity, duration, treatment (if 
required), resolution (or ongoing), assessment of seriousness, relationship to Study procedure and 
relationship to device will be recorded on the approp riate eCRF or SAE Report Form and submitted as 
necessary by [CONTACT_11219]/or Designee(s).  An y suspected AEs related to the Investigational Device 
or Study procedure must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_196432] (ADE) is defined as an AE re lated to the use of an investigational medical device.  
This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficien t or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, 
implantation, installation or operation, or any malfuncti on of the investigation de vice.  It also includes any 
AE resulting from use error or from intentio nal misuse of the Investigational Device.  
Causality of relationship to the Investigational De vice will be judged by [CONTACT_737], and reviewed
independently by [CONTACT_34164], as follows:Not related: 
xAn event is clearly not and cannot be related to  the Investigational Device.  Reporting is not 
required per protocol unless the event was rela ted to the Investigational Device or Study.
Possibly Related:
xA relationship may exist but could have been pr oduced by [CONTACT_5748] (e.g., treatment, 
condition).
Related:

Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE th at results in any of the following outcomes: death, a 
life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168347], a 
persistent or significant disability/incapac ity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Device Effects
A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is an AD E that has resulted in any of the consequences or 
characteristics of a SAE.  
SADEs must be reported to the Sponsor or designee, within [ADDRESS_196434] entry of 
AE/SAE data into the eCRF.  In ad dition, the Study site will report confirmed SADEs their IRB in accordance 
with the IRB’s requirements.  SADEs will al so be reported to the FDA, as required.
Recording and Reporting of Unan ticipated Adverse Device Events
Unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is define d in [ADDRESS_196435], problem, or death was not previously identified  in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including su pplementary plan or application), or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device  that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects. In contrast, an anticipated adverse device ef fect is an effect which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, 
severity, or outcome has been identi fied in the risk analysis report.
UADEs must be reported to the Spon sor or designee within [ADDRESS_196436] udy will be reviewed by [CONTACT_11219]/or 
Designee(s) and Sponsor.  These AEs will be followed until they are adequately resolved, explained by [CONTACT_145033]/or Designee(s), un til subject has completed follow-up or been withdrawn from the Study.  
     
POGO Study
Study #2019-[ADDRESS_196437]’s enrollment  in this Study are not expected to occur as a result 
of participation in the Study.  In the event of subjec t death; however, every reasonable effort should be 
made to obtain a copy of the autopsy report and/or de ath summary.  Information on the date and cause of 
death and its relationship to the Study device will be  determined by [CONTACT_11219]/or Designee and 
recorded on the appropriate AE eCRF and submitted on an SAE Report Form as necessary.
Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events Associated with Commercial Components
Any adverse event associated with an FDA cleared comp onent will be recorded as a device complaint and 
reported via the MDR program (21 CFR Part 803).  Co mplaints will also be reported to the IRB in 
accordance with each IRB’s requirements.  Device comp laints should be reported to the Sponsor as soon as 
the site becomes aware of the complaint.
Recording and Reporting of Pre-Existing Conditions
Pre-existing medical conditions and symptoms due to pre-existing medical conditions, surgery or admission to ICU will not be recorded as adverse even ts. The admission of a critically ill patient in the 
intensive care unit is commonly due to one or severa l serious medical conditions and/or a major surgery, 
which may cause changes and abnormalities of blood ch emistry, diagnostic and physiological parameters.  
In the event there is a deterioration of a pre-existing  medical condition or symptoms due to the use of the 
Study products or a Study related procedure, then the re view of the event will be initiated, and an AE will 
be recorded if it meets the definition.  Any events oc curring prior to the study procedure will be recorded 
as medical history. 
Reporting Adverse Events to the FDA
Confirmed UADEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_168388].  The FDA, all participating principal 
investigators and their reviewing IRBs will be informed no later than [ADDRESS_196438].

Nonrandomized, Observational Study  of Cardiac Output 
Monitoring in Pediatric Patients  
 
 
A modified intent-to-treat (mITT) principle will be app lied. Through investigator professional judgement and 
statistical principles, this study will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the applicable regulations 
and in accordance with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
 
All methods of measurements will be recorded for all devi ces and included as part of  the data set. Edwards will 
conduct analyses both with and without observations that are determined to be outliers.  Once outliers are identified, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_168353].   
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_196456] will be assessed for hemodynamic stability. Should there be any instability, the bolus will be rejected. All data will be recorded and any rejected 
values will be clearly identified in the eCRF.  
 The rejection criteria that will be used to de termine hemodynamic instability are detailed below: 
   
x FloTrac and ClearSight will display mean arterial pr essure (MAP).  If MAP varies  > 15% during the 
30-sec period of each intermittent ther modilution, the bolus will be rejected. 
i. If more than 1 result is greater than 15% of the mean or the prespecified rejection criteria 
is met, discard the entire series, and repeat the series of four thermodilutions. 
o Note: The likely cause for 2, 3 or 4 results being greater than 15% of the mean is technique dependent, i.e., shooting the thermodilution either fast, slow or drawing up 
the incorrect amount of fluid. 
ii. If none the results are greater than 15% of the mean or the prespecified rejection criteria 
is not met, discard one result that is furthest from the mean. 
x FloTrac and ClearSight will also display Pulse rate.  If Pulse varies > 15% during the 30-sec period of 
each ITD, the bolus will be rejected. 
i. If more than 1 result is greater than 15% of the mean or the prespecified rejection criteria 
is met, discard entire series, and repeat the series of four thermodilutions. o Note: The likely cause for 2, 3 or 4 results being greater than 15% of the mean is technique dependent, i.e., shooting the thermodilution either fast, slow or drawing up 
the incorrect amount of fluid. 
ii. If none the results are greater than 15% of the mean or the prespecified rejection criteria 
is not met, discard one result that is furthest from the mean. 
x ClearSight will display Physiocal.  If Physiocal is no t at least 30 beats, the bolus will be rejected.  
 
For Cardiac Output comparisons of FloTrac and ClearSight  to Swan-Ganz ITD, all hemodynamic monitors will be 
time aligned.    The CO values from ClearSight and FloTrac for the analyses will be prepared as follows:

In this study eight repeated measurements (m=8 sub samples) or sub sample sections will be taken during the

alpha=0.025, and power=90% to reject the null hypothesis is 45, ignoring the ICC.  After considering ICC for eight 
repeated measures (m=8), adjusting for multiple compar isons, considering comparisons of between two target 
devices and a reference device pairs, simultaneously, a sample size of 60 Subjects is needed. After considering a 34.5% rejection rate for hemodynamic instability, 10% lost to  follow-up rate, and 6 roll-in Subjects for the learning 
curve, up to 108 (102) evaluable Pi[INVESTIGATOR_168354] 6 Roll-in Subjects) will be enrolled into the study.  
 
By [CONTACT_168400] a mixed effect model, using repe ated measurement data collected from a 
similar study, although the sample size estimate from this  approach is conservative, it is reasonable and rational. 
 
2.3.2 Sample size consideration for percent error  
 
The Critchley and Critchley method of percent error (PE) calculation will be compared to 30%. The Precision will 
be considered as acceptable if PE is less than or equal to 30%.  The hypothesis for PE is a one-sided test:  H0: PE > 30% 
,ϭ͗WчϯϬй  
 
In a meta-analysis paper published in 2010, Peyton and Chong suggested that acceptable agreement should be a percentage error of 30% or less, which has become a widely quoted criterion.

should therefore be considered acceptable.” 
 
The sample size calculation for this hypothesis was based on the one-sided T-test. The desired outcome is to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.025 significance level. Assuming a true mean of 30% and a conservative SD assumption 
of 70%, the sample size required for power=90% to reject the null hypothesis is 49.  With Bonferroni adjustment for two comparison between three target device sy stems, enrollment of 60 subjects is required.  
 Additionally, in the paper "A meta-analysis of studies usin g bias and precision statistics to compare cardiac output 
measurement techniques,” Critchley LA and Critchley JA constructed an error gram from the percentage errors 
from the test and reference methods to determine acceptable limits between methods. They graphically showed 
that limits of agreement of up to +/-30% were acceptable for PE.

Because the study is designed with sub samples (repeated measurements) or sub sample sections (m=8), ICC is a 
factor needing to be considered in the sample size esti mation. By [CONTACT_168403] 
2.3.1, for m=8, the SD=69.38%, the corresponding sample size necessary is 49. For PE, a sample size of n=60 will 
be used in the study design, after considering two pairwise comparisons between 2 devices with a reference 
device.  In addition, after considering a, 34.5% rejectio n rate for hemodynamic instability, 10% lost to follow-up 
rate, up to 102 evaluable subjects will be targeted. To acco unt for the learning curve, 6 additional roll-in subjects 
will be enrolled (up to 3 at each site), tota ling [ADDRESS_196462] be ƐŵĂůůĞƌƚŚĂŶƚŚĞŵŝŶŝŵƵŵĐůŝŶŝĐĂů ĚŝĨĨĞƌĞŶĐĞɷ͕ǁŚŝĐŚŝƐƚŚĞǀĂ ůƵĞƚŚĂƚŝƐůĂƌŐĞĞŶŽƵŐŚƚŽĐůĂŝŵĚŝĨĨĞƌĞŶĐĞ͘  
 
The hypothesis for bias is: 
  H0:  bias <- ɷŽƌďŝĂƐхɷ  
  H1: -ɷчďŝĂƐчɷ  
 
Because there are no valid publications found through inte rnet searching to design th e settings in sample size 
estimation based on CI, the relation between CI and CO is used in sample size estimation here. Cardiac index (CI) 
is defined as cardiac output (CO)/body surface area (BSA).  By [CONTACT_168404] G. N., Leung P. Y. M., Mak P. S. K. et al. 2010 and Cattermole G. N., Leung P. Y. M., Ho G. Y. L. et al. 2017, the BSA value for kid with age 
൒8 is greater than 1, target on Chinese population in Hong Kong.  For the age group from 12 to 18 years, it is 
around 1.5. If the study subjects are from developed coun try the BSA value possibly will be larger. If the study 
targets at developi[INVESTIGATOR_168355], this value possibly will be smaller. By [CONTACT_168405]=1.2 is used

4. ANALYSIS  POPULATIONS  
 
The analysis set is composed of all evaluable subjects with valid CO matched pair ed measurements from 
the target medical device system ( Swan -Ganz ™, FloTrac ™, and ClearSight ™), the Fick principle  and the 
reference medical device system  (a Swan- Ganz thermodilution catheter) .  Evaluable subjects are those  
with non-rejected intermittent thermodilutions  who have completed the [ADDRESS_196464] has signed the informed consent, 
a Swan- Ganz catheter has been deployed, a FloTrac has been connected, a ClearSight finger cuff 
has been attached and/or ForeSight Elite sensors have been placed.  
 
5.2. Evaluable Subject  
 
An evaluable subject is one who has valid CO pair measurements  that were not rejected  and also 
has completed the 30 -Day follow up . 
 
5.3. Modified Intent -to-treat (mITT)  
 
Modified Intent -to-treat (mITT) is defined as the study subjects who were exposed to the study 
product and will therefore be included in the effectiveness and safety analysis dataset s.   
 
5.4. Per Protocol Analysis  
 A per protocol analysis is defined as a  datas et of subjects who completed the cardiac catherization  
as written in the protocol.  No protocol deviations  occurred  during the cardiac catherization 
procedure.

Revision Date: December 2, [ADDRESS_196465]’s medical historical data will be recorded on an electronic case report form (eCRF).  The CO measurement data will be downloaded from hemodynamic monitor (Hemosphere advanced monitoring platform).  The Roll-in cohort data will be analyzed 
separately.  
 The data analyses will be conducted with SAS 9.4 software system. Bland Altman analyses will be performed for bias and precision measures. Limits of agreement will be calculated. 
 
6.2 Handling of Missing Data  
 
Missing data are defined as those instances in which data collection was attempted yet failed for 
some reason (i.e. due to technological, procedural, and/or subject constraints). Demographic and baseline characteristics are collected from the study subjects as part of screening.  If missing data are not related to the subject’s eligibility criteria, missing data will be presented by [CONTACT_168414].  Subjects with 
missing data will be included in the final analysis.  However, if the missing data are related to the 
subject’s eligibility, this will be considered a protocol deviation, and in this case, the study data from this subject will be reviewed internally, to determine if the subject should be excluded f rom the final 
analysis set.  
 The CO measurements  are downloaded from the hemodynamic monitor. Theoretically, there should 
be no missing data. For data that are missing as defined above,  statistical imputation using the SAS

After downloading the data from the hemodynamic monitors, abnormal observations will be checked 
and evaluated for hemodynamic stability.   Should there be any instability, the result will be rejected.  
All data will be recorded, and any rejected values will be clearly identified in the eCRF.  
 
The rejection criteria that will be used to determine - hemodynamic instability are detailed below: 
x Mean arterial pressure (MAP):  If MAP varies > 15% during the 30-sec period of each 
intermittent thermodilution, the bolus will be rejected. 
x Pulse rate:  If Pulse varies > 15% during the 30-sec period of each ITD, the bolus will be 
rejected. 
x PhysioCal:  If PhysioCal is not at least 30 beats, the bolus will be rejected. 
x  
Upon taking four (4) thermodilution measurements and given the above criteria for classifying data 
as invalid, Edwards proposes to remove the one measurement that is the greatest outlier of the 
four.  If upon the rare occasion two or more outliers measure greater than 15% from the mean, 
within a series of measurements, or hemodynamic instability results when these observations are taken, the clinician will repeat the series.  If this scenario of repeating the series is missed by [CONTACT_168415], the 
outliers will be analyzed separately. In addition to the results for the collected parameters, the 
number of subjects with less than [ADDRESS_196467] less than 
3 valid measurements and were missed for repeated testing by [CONTACT_168416].  
Additionally, a supplementary exploratory analysis will be reported using all the recorded values 
(valid and invalid) to assess the impact of the excluded values.

12 APPENDIX  
13 LITERATURE SEARCH/REVIEW  
 
For the original FloTrac submission in 2004 and the publication (Nusmeier, van Der Hoeven, and 
Lemson, 2010), an abstract search was performed to compi[INVESTIGATOR_168358] (iCO, and 
CCO). PubMed was searched using the keywords “continuous” OR “Fick’ OR pulse contour" OR “TD”) AND "cardiac output" AND “precision”, to identify published literature that reported performance 
comparisons of cardiac output  measurements. A total of 97 abstracts of published articles were found 
as a result of the search.  
 Review of the abstracts showed that 42 of them were irrelevant. Of the 42 that were not taken into 
consideration, 17 reported on pre -clinical studies, 21 had insufficient statistics and 4 did not provide 
performance comparison of cardiac output. Hence, 55 abstracts were deemed relevant to this 
analysis. Ten out of 55 abstracts reported accuracy in terms of cardiac index. The remaining 45 
abstracts contained 75 pairs of Bland- Altman comparisons. Fourteen of the 75 Bland- Altman 
comparison pairs were reported as marginal or unacceptable, the remaining 61 pairs from 38 abstracts were reported as clinically acceptable [32 -69].  
 
Figure 1 indicates a histogram of the bias reported in the 61 comparisons. The range of bias reported 
as clinically acceptable was [ -0.79 …0.63]. However, from the histogram, it can be seen that only 
three of the reported values were outside +/ - 0.6 l/min. Thus, the literature advocated out er limits of 
+/- 0.6 l/min for the bias of a Bland- Altman comparison of cardiac output values.  
 
Since then, several CO validation studies against pulmonary and transpulmonary thermodilution with 
the noninvasive technology have been performed. The analysis of 10 of these studies [70- 79] showed 
a bias range of 0.0 to 0.6 L/min, with an average of 0.24 ± 0.19 L/min. Based on these data and after 
discussion with the Data Management and Bio- center of the National Center for Cardiovascular

Diseases ([CONTACT_168427] LI), the performance criterion was set at 0.5 L/min, i.e. bias is determined to 
be -0.5< bias < 0.5 l/min. This value is smaller in magnitude to the 0.8 l/min floor that the US FDA had 
previously considered for CO comparisons.

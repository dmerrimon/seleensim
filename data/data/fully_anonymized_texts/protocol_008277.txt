Primary objective :  
To evaluate whether the type of anesthesia, narcotic-ba sed versus inhalation -based (volatile) 
anesthesia, administered during cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB)  surgery contribute s to the wide 
variance in neurologic recovery and developmental outcomes after surgery in infants with congenital he art disease.  
 Secondary objectives: 1. To evaluate whether  levels of metabolites in blood and urine using magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy preoperatively , intraoperatively and 2-[ADDRESS_877197] 
postoperative neurologic recovery and outcome. 
2. To examine whether postoperative neurodevelopmental status changes can be predicted by [CONTACT_66594] (seizure activity) within the first two days after surgery. 
 
Background and Significance:  
Thirty thousand infants are born each year in the [LOCATION_002] with conge nital heart disease.  
Half of these infants require surgical intervention within the first year of life.  More importantly 
8-25% of these children develop neurologic sequelae, which can have a long- term detrimental 
effect on IQ and behavior (Bellinger 1991; duPlessis 1997; Hovels-Gurich 2001; Karl  2004).  
The question is whether there were predisposing neurologic factors preoperatively or were there intraoperative factors that led to the postoperative neurologic outcome s. 
 
Limperopoulos and colleagues have provided the strongest evidence of preoperative neurologic 
problems with both a formal neurobehavioral assessment and neurologic exam (Limperopoulos et al.  1997) .  Using the Einstein Neonatal Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale (ENNAS), they 
were able to iden tify neurobehavioral and neurologic deficits in more than half of full term 
infants with cardiac defects, cyanotic and non -cyanotic, prior to surgical intervention. Most 
studies conclude that preoperative neurobehavioral evaluations and long- term developmental 
follow -up of infants undergoing cardiac surgery are very important. However, many institutions 
do not offer routine neurologic and developmental follow- up of these at risk infants.   
 When drawing conclusions about the utility of differing strategies of CPB management and effects on neurologic outcome, one must consider the preoperative neurologic state.  Some 
studies find no difference in outcome and others report significant deficits occurring more often

[ADDRESS_877198] than low flow CPB (Limperopoulos  1999; Miller 1996; Brunberg 
1974; Bellinger 1991; Hesz 1988).  These studies were isolated to a single condition, 
transposition of the great arteries, and none of these studies examined the preoperative baseline neurologic or developmental status of the infants in order to be able to assess changes postoperatively. Furthermore, the question remains does the type of anesthetic p redict later 
neurologic outcome?  Recent evidence from animal research in rodents supports that anesthe tics may cause 
neurodegeneration in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866] (Jevtovic-Tedorovic 2003).  This has been further supported by [CONTACT_653760].  Neurodegeneration was most evident in rat pups, [ADDRESS_877199] on anesthesia induced neurodegeneration (Faberowski 2004).  The pathognomic anesthetic for a prolonged anesthetic exposure in infants is that used for CPB.  The studies from 
Bellinger and others were during a period where high dose fentanyl was the primary anesthetic. Currently, volatile anesthetics seem to be the more commonly used anesthetic because of the work of Kurth and others.  Kurth et al (2001, 2002) demonstrated improved histiologic outcome 
in pi[INVESTIGATOR_653750] a volatile anesthetic as opposed to a fentanyl anesthetic.  
 Perioperative brain imaging studies have also been useful in documenting CNS injury such as hypoxic- ischemic encephalopathy and focal cortical infarctions  (Gaynor 2003; Tavani 2004; 
Mahle 2003). Recently, serial proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain was used to evaluate children under two different intraoperative strategies: low flow versus normal flow CPB and low versus high hematocrit during CPB (Ashwal 2004).  In this series of eleven infants, long and short echo time single voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy in occipi[INVESTIGATOR_653751].  
Changes in brain N- acetyl -aspartate, and increases in myoinositol and glutamate/glutamine after 
surgery were sensitive in detecting postoperative neurologic changes; however, thes e changes 
could not be correlated to a difference in by[CONTACT_653761].  Additionally, according to Newburger et al. (1993) and Rappaport (1998), 
postoperative seizure activity within [ADDRESS_877200] predictive of poor neurologic outcome at one year of age.  
The blood brain barrier in children less than one year of age is disrupted by [CONTACT_653762]. We wish to study these changes in N -acetyl -aspartate, and increases in myoinositol and glutamate/glutamine 
via the use of blood and urine samples rather than cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872]  (Cavaglia M 2004) .  We 
wish to avoid lumbar puncture in a heparinized child and also avoid the transport of an unstable child to the MRI scanner , thus limiting our study to blood and urine specimens only.  We would 
like to confirm our findings via blood and urine with peri operative EEG monitoring for 48 hrs 
seizure activity and Bayley III testing  at 18- 24 months of age in the two anesthesia (narcotic -
based vs. volatile ) groups.

Patient Accrual/Selection of Study Population: Neonates (children 30 days in age or less)  diagnosed with congenital heart disease will be 
evaluated and potentially recruited from the NICU or CICU.  It is anticipated that [ADDRESS_877201] 90% survival to discharge and 30 % refusal, there w ill be 35-60 infants  who could be 
recruited  per year .   We wish to recruit 20 0 patients over 5 years. Assuming a 70- 75% return 
rate, approximately 30-50 infants are expected to return for their 18 month follow -up.  
 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:  
 Inclusion  Crit eria: 
• All neonates less than [ADDRESS_877202] 
conceptional age admitted  to The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653752].    
• Admitting diagnosi s of cyanotic heart disease.  
 Exclusion Criteria:  
• Infants > [ADDRESS_877203] conceptional age  or <[ADDRESS_877204] conceptional age on admission.  
• Infants with the diagnosis of acyanotic heart disease 
• Infants with documented central nervous system m alformations . 
• Infants requiring unexpected postoperative ECMO support will be excluded. 
 Consent and HIPAA authorization:  
All subjects will be consented prior to participation in this study and prior to randomization.  Parents/guardians will be approached by [CONTACT_653763], usually the day prior to surgery.  The study anesthesiologists are all COMIRB certified and experienced in obtaining consent for research studies.  The s tudy will be explained to the parents/guardians in a quiet area away from 
other patients to allow time for questions.  Parents will be asked to explain the study in their own words to assess understanding of the study.  A HIPAA authorization will be obtain ed at the same 
time as consent.  Parents/guardians will be given copi[INVESTIGATOR_653753].  
 
Subject Randomization/ Determination of anesthetic maintenance:  
All infants enrolled in the study will receive a preopera tive assessment by [CONTACT_653764].  Since all of these infants will have a peripheral intravenous line preoperatively, the induction will be standardized to sevoflurane up to 8%, 2 mcg/kg of fentanyl and 1 mg/kg of rocuronium.  Induct ion is the period in which the airway is secured.  This usually 
takes 5 -10 minutes in an otherwise normal infant.  
 The anesthetic maintenance  will be determined using a computer- generated randomization table 
and assigning each patient to one of the two anesthetic regimens (see Table 1) .  For instance, 
subject #[ADDRESS_877205] is assigned to receive a volatile anesthetic , isoflurane . That subject’s maintenance will

 be with a vola tile anesthetic, isoflurane.    Isoflurane was chosen as the maintenance anesthetic 
because it is the only anesthetic vaporizer currently available for our CPB  machines.

Subject [ADDRESS_877206] 7  X  
 Anesthetic Technique:  
Volatile anesthetic:  
In volatile anesthetic technique, m aintenance of anesthesia will be standardized to the volatile 
anesthetic isoflurane .  Isoflurane will be used for the study since this is what is presently 
available on the CPB machines.  Anesthesia at 1.0 MAC indicates that at this concentration 50% 
of the patients will not move when s urgically stimulated. We commonly use about 1.2-1.4 MAC 
in neonates, since the MAC value in infants is higher than that of children and adults. Isoflurane  
will be delivered at 1.5-2.0% % as required for anesthetic management.  These concentrations of 
isoflurane  represent 1.0 to 1.2 MAC of anesthesia.  Rocuronium or pancuronium will be used for 
muscle relaxation.  Narcotic, fentanyl will be administered at no greater than 2 mcg/kg/hr.   
However , the primary anes thetic during CPB will be isoflurane  with no narcotic administered 
during CPB.  Narcotic- based anesthetic:  
In narcotic based anesthetic technique, no volatile anesthetics will be used past induction. Maintenance of anesthesia will be with fentanyl 5 mcg/kg/hr not to exceed 10 mcg/kg/hr.  The anesthe tic may be supplemented with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg/hr but not to exceed  1.0 mg/kg/hr.  
Narcotic- based  anesthetic will be used by [CONTACT_653765].  5 mcg/kg/hr of fentanyl is felt to represent 0.[ADDRESS_877207] technique in managing neonates undergoing CPB.  However, the primary anesthetic during CPB will be fentanyl with no 
isoflurane administered during CPB  
 Postope rative Sedative and Analgesic Care : 
As per our institutional standard of care,  postoperative sedation will consist of  fentanyl infusions 
of 2-10 mcg/kg/hr for the first 48 hours postoperatively.    Data collection:  
Detailed chart review and data collection will be performed to obtain data for multivariate analyses including 1) socio -demographic data, 2) presence of metabolic acidosis*, 3)  intubation,  
4) history of pa lliative intervention proced ure-prostaglandins, atrial septostomy, 5) age at 
surgery, 6) length of circulatory arrest and duration of CPB, 7) complications of surgery, and 8) head ultrasound or MRI studies if obtained for clinical indications .

removed before 72 hours, this is the endpoint of the study; all samples will be from an arterial line 
which is a standard of care for anesthesia and critical care monitoring.  
 
NMR spectroscopy of blood and urine samples Blood samples: Blood samples will be obtained from a peripheral arterial catheter routinely placed a s per 
protocol for procedures requiring CPB. Blood will be obtained at 9 time points:  Prior to surgery, during anesthesia and prior to by[CONTACT_6476], during CPB, immediately after by[CONTACT_6476], and 6,12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after by[CONTACT_6476]. Heparin -preserved whole blood (0.5 mL) will be used for NMR 
analysis. All samples will be placed on ice, then frozen and stored at -78 degree until extraction. 
Prior to NMR analysis, 0.5 mL of blood will be extracted using a dual methanol/ chloroform extraction developed in our laboratory (Serkova et al., 2005). This allows for protein precipi[INVESTIGATOR_653754] -soluble and lipid metabolites. Blood will be carefully 
vortexed and processed with 1 mL of cold chloroform/methanol (1:1, vol/vol). After centrifugation, the supernatants will be collected and the pellets will be re -suspended with 0.5 
mL of chloroform/methanol, centrifuged, and the supernatants will be collected. The supernatant will be washed with 0.5 mL ice -cold water. The water phase will be removed and added to the 
pellet. One mL of water will be added and the pellet will be centrifuged and the supernatant will be lyophilized overnight (water- soluble extracts). Afterwards the water- soluble part will be 
dissolved in 0.5 mL D
2O and analyzed by [CONTACT_653766]. The lipi[INVESTIGATOR_653755] 06 -0483

 evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen at 50°C. The lipid extracts will be dissolved in 
0.6 mL of deuterated chloroform/ methanol (2:1, vol/vol) for 1H-NMR analysis.  
 Urine collection:  Urine (3 mL) will be collected from a foley catheter routinely placed for surgical procedures 
requiring CPB  at 10 time points:  Prior to surgery, during anesthesia and prior to by[CONTACT_6476], during 
CPB, immediately after by[CONTACT_6476], and 6,12, 24, 48 and 120 hours after by[CONTACT_6476].  Urine and blood samples will  be centrifuged to remove possible proteins if present. The sample s 
will be placed on ice, then frozen and stored at - 78 degree until extraction. Prior to NMR 
analysis, the pH will be adjusted  to 5.7 using K
2HPO 4/ KH 2PO 4-buffer. The samples will be 
lyophilized overnight, and re-dissolved in 0.[ADDRESS_877208] Bruker water presaturation sequence will be used (“zgpr”)  (operating frequency for proton channel: 500.24 MHz; power level pl1=3 dB; power level for water suppression pl9=55

d12=20 µs; short delay d13=3 µs; spectral width sw=12ppm; total number of scans ns=40). An external standard substance, trimethylsilyl propi[INVESTIGATOR_58585] -2, 2, 3, 3,-d
4 acid (TMSP, 20 and 50 mM in 
D2O) will be added into a thin glass ca pi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]. The final TMSP concentration (0.5 mmol/L and 
1.2 mmol/L) in the capi[INVESTIGATOR_653756] a standard amino acid solution. The TMSP capi[INVESTIGATOR_653757] ( 0.5 mmol/L for water-soluble extracts and 1.2 mmol/L for lipid extracts) and served 
as an external standard which allowed for absolute metabolite quantification in each study 
extract. 
1H chemical shifts will be referred to TMSP signal at 0 ppm. After performing Fourier 
transformation and making phase and baseline corrections, each 1H peak will be integrated using 
1D WINNMR program (Bruker Biospin Inc., Fremont, CA). The absolute concentrations of 
single metabolites will be then referred to the TMSP integral and calculated according to the equation (1):  
M V:9 : IC Nx: Ix   Cx  ××=  (1) 
where  Cx = metabolite concentration  
 Ix = integral of metabolite 1H peak  
 Nx = number of protons in metabolite 1H peak (from CH, CH 2, CH 3, etc.)

 Neurologic exam s and neurobehavioral testing:  
At 18-[ADDRESS_877210] to determine the pre sence of abnormal and/or asymmetric muscle tone and 
persistent or abnormal primitive reflexes. Head circumference and other growth parameters will also be measured. Neurocognitive and motor status will be assessed by a neonatologist using the 
Bayley Scales of Infant Development- Third Edition (Bayley III), which is the most frequently used standardized assessment of developmental milestone achievement in infants and young children.  The Bayley I II measures cognitive and motor development resulting in both a n index 
score, comparable to an IQ score, and an age equivalent.  The Behavior Rating Scale of the Bayley III combines observation and parent report and is divided into factors measuring attention/arousal, orientation/engagement, emotional regulation and motor quality.   Risk s: 
There are no additional risks to participating in the study.  Both narcotic-based and volatile anesthetics are standard practice at The Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 Benefits:  
There is no direct benefit to the patient or the patient’s family . The results of this research may  
help physicians evaluate the efficacy of different anesthetics  by [CONTACT_653767]- term neurologic and neurobehavioral outcome. It may also lead to new 
approaches to the study and use of neuroprotective agents and better selection of infants who might benefit from early intervention services after discharge, as well as provide a means of 
more accurately predicting neuropathology, recovery and long term neurodevelopmental 
outcome in infants wi th congenital heart disease.  
 Subject payment : 
Families will receive  to compensate for travel time  at the [ADDRESS_877211]:  
There will be no costs incurred upon the subject or family.  MRI spectroscopy  of blood and 
urine , EEG studies and Bayley III evaluations will be covered by [CONTACT_316923] .  
 Data analysis and monitoring: The dependent variable or primary outcome of concern is the child's neurodevelopmental status at 18- [ADDRESS_877212] surgery for congenital hea rt disease (CHD).  The data used to index 
neurodevelopmental status include the socioeconomic status, preoperative status - intubation, 
prostaglandin infusion, atrial septostomy, preoperative diagnosis of cyanotic heart disease with or without a ventricular  septal defect, presence of a non -restrictive versus restrictive  atrial septal 
defect, neurological exam, tests of developmental achievement and MRI spectroscopy data.  MRI spectroscopy data include: Peak area metabolite levels for N -acetylaspartate, creat inine, 
choline, and the lactate doublet.  Peak area metabolite levels will be calculated as a ratio of the above variables.

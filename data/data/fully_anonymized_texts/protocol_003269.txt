Study Center s: 2 sites in the U nited States  
Study Period:  Phase of Development:  
Estimated date f irst subject enrolled: March 1st, [ADDRESS_952188] completed:  January 1st, 2018 1b 
Objectives:   
Primary:  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of varenicline 1 mg twice -daily ( BID), 
compared with matched placebo, on alcohol cue- elicited alcohol craving during a human laboratory paradigm  
after two week s of BID daily dosing  among subject s with moderate alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) as confirmed by 
[CONTACT_92678] –  Fifth Edition (DSM -5™).   
Secondary:  Secondary objectives include evaluation of varenicline compared with placebo on reduction of 
alcohol  consumption, alcohol craving, cigarette smoking (among smokers)  and nicotine use (among nicotine  
users ), mood, sleep, study retention, and safety and tolerability throughout the last 4 weeks of the maintenance 
phase of the study.  
Methodology:  This study is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel group, two -site study 
designed to assess the effects of varenicline as compared with placebo on respons es to in vivo  alcohol cue 
exposure in the  human laboratory setting. After signing informed consent, subjects will be screened for eligibility 
including medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram  (ECG), drinking history by [CONTACT_451867] -back (TLFB) method, alcohol breathalyzer test, Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for 
Alcohol -revised (CIWA), medication use, MINI  neuropsychiatric interview, urine toxicology screen, clinical 
chemistry, response to cue reactivity , and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( CSSR -S). Women of chi ld-
bearting potential will have a pregnancy test. If eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized using a 
stratified permuted block randomization procedure in an approximate 1:1 ratio (targeting 2 4 subjects per group –  
12 subjects per group per site ) to receive either varenicline or placebo for 6 weeks. Any nicotine use versus no 
use (cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, electronic cigarettes, etc.)  in the week before randomization is  the 
stratification variable.  
Varenicline or matched placebo will b e titrated over the first week of the study up the maintenance dose of 1 mg 
(active) or two capsules (placebo) taken orally BID for an additional 5  weeks. Subjects will be seen in the clinic 
at screening, at randomization and 6 other times during the study . A final follow -up telephone interview will 
occur during Week 9 (2 weeks after the end of study visit).  
After the first two weeks  and after five weeks  of investigational product administration at Study Week [ADDRESS_952189] s will undergo a cue reactivity paradigm session  (HLAB) including 4 
individual visual analog scale (VAS) items  assessing alcohol craving , [ADDRESS_952190] the emotion felt using the Self -Manikin Assessment (SAM) . Other 
assessments at baseline (prior to the first dose of investigational product) and/or during the maintenance period 
include clinical chemistry, mood/behavior/thinking questions , blood for medication compliance , vital signs , 
ECG , concomitant med ication s, CIWA -AR, pregnancy test  and birth control methods , drinking goal , adverse 
even ts (AEs),  Alcohol Craving Questi onnaire – Short Form (ACQ -SF-R), Penn Alcohol Craving Scale ( PACS ), 
Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, smoking quantity/frequency, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_33548] ( PSQI ),

Statistical Methods (Data Analysis):  
Analysis Populations:  
Modified intention- to-treat (mITT) Analysis Set:  The mITT set is defined as subjects randomized to 
participate in the study that  took at least one dose of investigational product  and had at least one non -missing 
VAS craving primary endpoint (completed human laboratory assessment) . 
Evaluable Analysis Set : The evaluable analysis set for the secondary endpoints is defined as those subjects 
randomized to the study who took at least 1.[ADDRESS_952195] 80% of days in Weeks 2- 6. All evaluable 
analysis sets will exclude subjects with a major protocol deviation.  
Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  Repeated -measures mixed effects models will be used to examine 
drug-placebo differences in VAS craving ratings in response to beverage exposure, where drug is treated as a 
fixed, between -subjects variable and beverage presentation is the repeat ed measure. Beverage will be considered 
a fixed, within- subjects variable and subject as a random effect.  
Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints : Continuous secondary endpoints (percent heavy drinking days, percent 
very heavy drinking days, percent days abstinent, drinks per week, drinks per drinking day, number of cigarettes 
smoked per week, PA CS, POMS, and PSQI score) will be analyzed using a mixed -model repeated measures 
ANCOVA controlling for site, nicotine use in the week before randomization , and baseline drinking as fixed 
factors.  Models will also include time by [CONTACT_264243]. Additional covariates may be included 
that are significantly correlated with outcome and/or if there are dif ferences across the treatment groups.  
Analysis of the dichotomous secondary endpoints (percentage subjects with no heavy drinking days, percentage 
subjects abstinent from alcohol, percentage of subjects achieving at least a one and two -level shift in WHO 
alcohol consumption , and percentage of subjects with no nicotine use over the  last 4 -weeks of maintenance 
period among subjects with any use during the week before randomization ) will be conducted via logistic 
regression. Covariates may be included provide d there are a sufficient number of events.  
In general, no imputation for missing endpoint data will be performed. However, as a sensitivity analysis, 
missing drinking data for the secondary endpoint percent heavy drinking days will be handled in two ways a s 
done by [CONTACT_701449] (2013) : (a) by [CONTACT_701450] ; and (b) by [CONTACT_701451]. The multiple imputation model will the same covariates as the efficacy model for this endpoint. 
Twenty -five iterations of this model will be run, and model estimates will be averaged using PROC 
MIANALYZE in SAS, or a similar procedure.  
Safety Analyses:   
AEs will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ) 
preferred terms and will be grouped by [CONTACT_57501], organ, and class (SOC) designation. The severity, frequency, and 
relationship of AEs to investigational product will be presented by [CONTACT_218903][INVESTIGATOR_007]. Listings of 
each individual AE including s tart date, stop date, severity, relationship, outcome, and duration will be provided. 
Each AE (based on preferred terminology) will be counted once only for a given study subject . If the same AE 
occurred on multiple occasions, the highest severity will be assumed. Thus, study participants are not counted multiple times in a given numerator in the calculation of frequencies for a specific AE. Laboratory data, 
pregnancy test results, and alcohol breathalyzer results, psychiatric symptoms, and CIWA scores will  be reported

Compliance and Participation Outcomes : Medication compliance is defined as the amount of medication taken 
as a proportion of  the total amount prescribed.  Compliance will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_701452], reported taking varenicline, and had a plasma sample with detectable varenicline. The participation rate is the percentage of subjects with complete drinking data. 
Compliance and participation rates will be reported on a weekly basis and across the entire trial duration  
Baseline Descriptive Statistics:  Summaries of the characteristics of the subjects in each of the study groups at 
baseline will be prepared for both the mITT and evaluable analysis sets. Baseline characteristics will be 
compared between the varenicline  and placebo groups using appropriate statistical methods .

4.1. Alcohol Use Disorder  
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) (alcohol dependence and abuse) affects 76 million adults world-
wide, including 18 million Americans, and is responsible for a myriad of medical, psychological, 
social, economic and personal problems ( Litten et al -2012 ). Tragically, more than 2.[ADDRESS_952211] to society is a staggering $224 billion each year in the [LOCATION_002] (US) (
NIAAA -2014 ) 
4.2. Human Lab oratory Studies  
Human l aboratory studies of acute responses to alcohol, alcohol cues, or other pharmacological 
and/or experimental manipulations have progressed in important ways, and have the potential to greatly advance our understanding neurobehavioral mechanisms of alcohol effects on behavior 
(Plebani et al -2014
). These studies may help identify important individual difference factors 
affecting alcohol response, such as personal traits, drinking characteristics, and genotype, and aid 
in our understanding of the variability in cue and craving states, and pr ovide additional 
information relevant to the design of clinical studies to assess the effective ness of 
pharmacological agents.  The study to be conducted in this protocol utilizes an alcohol cue 
reactivity model to attempt to recreate in the laboratory risk  conditions for relapse similar to 
those experienced by [CONTACT_701453] ( Niaura et al -1988; Litt and 
Cooney - 1999 ). 
Human laboratory studies have been conducted that examine the e ffect of positive and negative 
affective stimuli and beverage cues on craving in non treatment -seeking subjects  with a lcohol 
dependence. In a study reported by  [CONTACT_701454]  (2008 ), the moderating effects of a priming 
exposure to both positive and negative affective stimuli on beverage cue -induced craving  were 
examined . Subjects were exposed to a standardized set of pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant visual 
stimuli followed by [CONTACT_701455] w ater cues  and ps ychophysiological cue reactivity measures were 
obtaine d during beverage presentation and subjective reactivity measures were taken following 
beverage presentation. Ps ychophysiological  measures included h eart rate, skin conductance, and 
facial electromyogram (EMG) which were monitored throughout each experimental trial as 
confirmatory measures of the primary subjective measures of craving and emotion. Assessment of alcohol craving in response to each affect -beverage condition was assessed usi ng four  
individual Visual Analog Scales (VAS). In addition, the S elf-Assessment Manikin  (SAM) 
(
Bradley and Lang -1994 ) was utilized as a non- verbal pi[INVESTIGATOR_701419] ( valence, arousal, and dominance ) associated with a p erson's affective 
reaction to stimuli.  
Results of mixed -effect analyses of subjective outcome measures in the Mason et al  (2008 ) study 
showed statistically significant main effects of alcoholic beverage cue on three of four individual 
craving questions, and on the mean of the four items. The effect size for alcoholic beverage cue 
on subjective craving measures ranged from 0.58 (strength of craving), to 0.22 (difficult to turn 
down); the  composite effect size was 0.45. Positive affect independent of beverage cue 
significantly increased craving strength and showed a trend for a significant increase in the 
composite craving scale. Effect sizes for positive affect ranged from 0.55 (difficult  to turn down) 
Varenicline – Human Laboratory Paradigm  HLAB, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 14 NIAAA 
Confidential   to nearly zero (make things perfect). For negative affect, the largest effect size was 0.18 (strength 
of craving), and none of the effects of negative affective stimuli on measure of craving were 
statistically significant.  No interaction eff ects were detected between alcoholic beverage cue and 
affective stimuli on any outcome measure of craving. A n important finding of this study is that 
positive affective stimuli commonly associated with drinking situations can induce craving in the absence of alcohol cues.  
Another  human laboratory proof -of-concept study  was conducted by [CONTACT_701454]  (2009
) to 
evaluate the effectiveness of gabapentin to attenuate some of the symptoms of protracted abstinence from alcohol . The labor atory study design was  intended to model and predict the 
critical first week on medication during a clinical trial, when participants’ sleep and mood 
disturbances, or other side effects, could dramatically affect medication compliance and increase 
the risk for subject discontinuation. The experimental design mirrored the human l ab study 
model where  positive affective stimuli induced induce craving (
Mason et al -2008 ). Th is study 
design employed a 4 -hour cue reactivity pr otocol which included a baseline evaluation, followed 
by [CONTACT_701456], and subsequent debriefing. As in the previous human lab study, 
3 affective stimuli (positive, neutral, negative) and 2 beverage cues (alcohol and water) were 
deployed w ithin-subjects, in a block- factorial design of [ADDRESS_952212] (with order varying systematically across subjects) during the course of a single afternoon. A lcohol craving was asses sed using four 
separate VAS measurements and p sychophysiological measures of heart rate, skin conductance , 
and EMG were recorded.  
This study results showed that subjects randomized to receive gabapentin had significantly 
attenuated craving responses to th ree of the four subjective craving measures (how strong  is your 
urge to drink, I would drink now if I could, it would be difficult to turn down a drink now)  
Mason et al  (2009 ). In contra st, gabapentin reduced a rousal induced by  [CONTACT_701457] 
(beverage, positive affect, and negative affect) as measured by [CONTACT_701458]. Given 
that s ubjects random ized to receive gabapentin had reduced alcohol craving , and analysis of the 
secondary study endpoints demonstrated significantly improve d measures of sleep quality , the 
hypothesis was supported that gabapentin may be effective for treating the protracted abstinence 
phase in alcohol dependence.  
4.3. Rationale for Studying Varenicline 
Both nicotine and alcohol have been show n to stimulate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors which 
elevate dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, an important part of the brain reward system  
(Tizabi et al -2002 ). These studies supported the hypothesis that administration of selective 
nicotinic antagonists may be of therapeutic potential in reducing the rewarding effects of ethanol . 
Separate administration of varenicline or ethanol produc ed significant elevations of  dopamine 
compared with saline injections, and when the  two drugs were administered concomitantly, they 
counteracted each other's dopamine enhancing properties ( Erickson et al -2009 ).  The 
comparability of doses needed to inhibit alcohol -related biochemical changes and behavior to  
nicotinic processes suggests that the regimen used clinically to diminish nicotine craving might 
also diminish alcohol craving . 
In a human lab study , varenicline’s effects  (2 mg/day vs. placebo) on alcohol self -administration 
using an established laboratory paradigm in non- alcohol -dependent heavy drinkers (n=20) who 
Varenicline – Human Laboratory Paradigm  HLAB, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 15 NIAAA 
Confidential   were daily smokers  was investigated  (McKee et al -2009 ). Following 7 days of medi cation 
pretreat ment of placebo or varenicline ( 0.5 mg daily for Days 1 and 2, 0.5 mg twice daily for 
Days 3 –5, and 1.0 mg twice daily on Days 6 and 7 ), participants were first administered a 
priming dose of alcohol (0.3 g/kg) and subjective and physiologic  responses were assessed. A 
2-hour alcohol self -administration period followed during which participants could choose to 
consume up to 8 additional drinks (each 0.15 g/kg).  Varenicline significantly reduced the 
number of drinks consumed compared to placeb o and increased the likelihood of abstaining from 
any drinking during the self -administration period. Following the priming drink, varenicline 
attenuated alcohol craving and reduced subjective reinforcing alcohol effects (high, like, rush, feel good, intox icated). AEs associated with varenicline were minimal and, when combined with 
alcohol, produced no significant effects on physiologic reactivity, mood, or nausea.  
Varenicline significantly reduced alco hol consumption and craving in a multisite, P hase 2 
double -blind, placebo controlled randomized study suggesting that varenicline may be a 
potentially viable option for the treatment of alcohol use disorders (AUD) ( Litten et al- 2013 ). 
Results of th is study demonstrated that the va renicline group experienced significantly lower 
weekly percent heavy drinking days than the placebo group (37.9 vs. 48.4, respectively; p=0.03; 
d=0.31) . In addition, it was shown that the varenicline group had fewer drinks per day and lower 
percent of very  heavy drinking days  than the placebo group (p’s <0.05 ). In addition, the 
varenicline group scored low er on alcohol craving as measured  by [CONTACT_701459] (PACS) , a five -item self -administered instrument for assessing craving  (Flannery et al -
1999 ). 
4.4. Discussion of the Study Design 
The current study design will utilize repeated -measures mixed effects  models  to assess the 
varenicline -placebo differences in Visual Analog Scales (VAS) craving rating s. The  design 
includes  3 affective image (positive, neutral, negative affect) and 2 beverage (a lcohol, water) 
within -subjects  conditions  where drug is treated as a fixed  between -subject s variable, beverage 
condition is the fixed within- subjects  repeat ed measure, and subject is the random effect. All six 
mood- beverage cue combinations will be  presented to each subject (with order varying 
systematically across subjects) during the course of a single afternoon. Since order effects of cue presentation have been obser ved in previous studies , subjects will be s ystematically assigned one 
of six cue order combinations, in the order they were enrolled in the study.  
To verify a safe return to a baseline state following the cue exposure trials, the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire short  form revised (ACQ -SF-R) (Singleton et al -1994
) will be administered both 
prior to and following the cue reactivity procedure to ensure that the trials had not resulted in a prolonged subjective urge to drink.

This study is a double -blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, parallel group, two- site study 
designed to assess the effects of varenicline as compared with placebo on responses to in vivo 
alcohol cue exposure in the human laboratory setting. After signing informed consent, subjects 
will be screened for eligibility including medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), drinking history by [CONTACT_527936] -back (TLFB) method, alcohol 
breathalyzer test, Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol- revised (CIWA), 
medication use, Mini neu ropsychiatric interview, urine toxicology screen, clinical chemistry, 
response to water cue craving session, and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSR -S). 
Women of child- bearing potential will have a pregnancy test. If eligible for the study, subjects 
will be randomized using a stratified permuted block randomization procedure in an approximate 1:1 ratio (targeting 24 subjects per group – 12 subjects per group per site) to rec eive either 
varenicline or placebo for 6 weeks. Any nicotine use versus no use ( cigarettes, cigars, chewing 
tobacco, electronic cigarettes, etc.) over the past week prior to randomization is the stratification variable.  
Varenicline (1 mg) or matched placeb o will be taken orally BID for 6 weeks. Subjects will 
continue taking medication for an additional 4 weeks following the human lab paradigm. Subjects will be seen in the clinic at screening, at randomization and 6 other times during the 
study. A final foll ow-up telephone interview will occur during Week 9 (2 weeks after the end of 
study visit).  
After the first two weeks of investigational product administration  and after five weeks  at Study 
Week 3  and Study Week 6, respectively , subjects will undergo a cue reactivity paradigm session 
(HLAB) including 4 individual visual analog scale (VAS) items assessing alcohol craving  and 
emotional reactivity . Immediately after the HLAB session, subjects will view each pi[INVESTIGATOR_701420]-Manikin Assessment (SAM). Other assessments at 
baseline (prior to the first dose of investigational product) and/or during the maintenance period 
include clinical chemistry, mood/behavior/thinking questions, blood for medication compliance, 
vital signs,  ECG, concomitant medications, CIWA -AR, pregnancy test and birth control 
methods, drinking goal, adverse events (AEs), Alcohol Craving Questionnaire – Short Form 
(ACQ -SF-R), Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS), Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence,

7.1. Investigational Products: Varenicline Tartrate and Placebo  
Varenicline tablets in 0.5 mg strength will be over encapsulated and supplied by [CONTACT_25733]’s 
contracted pharm acy, along with identical matching placebo capsules. Capsules in identical 
blister packaging configurations will be prepared in kits for each subject containing one blister 
card with 7 days of drug/placebo for each week  of drug/placebo administration + 2 e xtra blister 
cards  (with enough drug/placebo for one week in the event that a subject loses or misplaces an 
entire blister card , or is late for an appointment and needs  an additional blister card  until the next 
appointment is scheduled). 
7.2. Investigational Pr oduct Storage  
Kits should be stored at room temperature (within the range of 59°F to 86°F) in a secured area at 
the clinical site.  
7.3. Investigational Product Dispensing  
One blister card containing 7 days of drug/placebo and 1 additional (emergency) blister ca rd 
containing 7 days of drug/placebo will be distributed after randomization, Week 1, Day 1. Each week the subject will receive a new blister card with enough medication for 7 days of 
drug/placebo. The extra blister card will be collected at the end of the  study or at the next clinic 
visit if drug/placebo was used during the week prior. The 2nd emergency blister card will be 
dispensed if the subject returns the [ADDRESS_952216] Accountability  
The site principal investigator (PI) or designated study personnel will maintain a log of the 
receipt of all investigational products and record of dispensing of all investigational products to the subject. Investigational product for each s ubject will be inventoried and accounted for 
throughout the trial. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her staff will count the capsules  remaining at the end of 
the study and record the capsules  count on the appropriate drug accountability form. Subject 
compliance with inv estigational product will be assessed by [CONTACT_701460] (number of capsules  dispensed, number of capsules  
prescribed , versus the number returned). Subjects will also be asked to account for any missing 
capsules . If the blister card is not returned, the subject will be asked to report daily drug self -
administration . 
7.5. Investigational Product Administration  
Varenicline will be self -administered by [CONTACT_701461] a full 
glass of water beginning on Day 1, Week [ADDRESS_952217] dose. D ose will be titrated, as toler ated, to a target dose of 1 
mg twice a day of varenicline. Dose titration, maintenance and taper will occur as shown in

Capsules should be swallowed whole and should not be cut, crushed, or chewed. Capsules 
should be taken with food and water .  
Missed Doses:  If a subject misses more than one dose of investigational product, he /she will be 
instructed to re -start taking the investigational product at the dosage level that s/he was taking 
before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. If one dose of investigational product is missed, he/she should take it 
immediately unless it is close to the time f or the next dose. In that case the subject should skip 
taking the missed dose of investigational product and wait until the usual time to take their next 
dose of investigational product. The subject should not double up doses. 
Dose Reduction and Discontinu ation. For problematic nausea (or other mild- moderate AEs), 
the dose may be reduced to 1 mg once daily and then  0.5 mg once daily. If the AE resolves at the 
lower dose, another attempt to increase the dose to the target of 1 mg twice daily is appropriate a t 
the clinical staff designated prescriber’s  discretion.   
7.6. Take Control Behavioral Platform  
The behavioral platform “Take Control”  (Devine et al., 2016)  will consist of a series of 7 
computerized modules. Subjects will view a single module of “Take Control”  at each clinic visit 
starting after randomization on Week 1, Day1. If a visit is missed, missed modules will be 
reviewed at the next visit. The paper versions of the modules are not to be given to the subject to 
take home and must remain at the clinic. Th e intervention is derived from a self -help approach 
developed by [CONTACT_566077] -based, field tested information for individuals with 
alcohol problems, and suggestions for making changes in their drinking. The NIAAA material is publically avai lable in a NIAAA booklet entitled “Rethinking Drinking” and on a NIAAA 
website http://rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov. Delivering these materials in a computerized 
method in this trial has the advantage of standardizing the amount of educational material 
received by [CONTACT_423].  
7.7. Concomitant Medications  
Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically 
meaningful pharmacokinetic  (PK) drug interactions.  
Safety and efficacy of varenicline in combination with other smoking cessation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_701421] :

• dual uptake inhibitors  
• serotonin- norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] (SNRIs)  
• tricyclic antidepressants  
• monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)  
Pharmaceutical treatments approved for treatment of alcoholism or treatments known to be used off-label or experimentally for treatment o f alcoholism are prohibited during the study. The 
following drugs approved for the treatment of alcoholism are also prohibited:  
• Oral naltrexone (Revia, Depade)  
• Depot naltrexone (Vivitrol)  
• Disulfiram (Antabuse)  
• Acamprosate (Campral)  
• Nalmefene (Selincro)  
In addition, a list of prohibited drugs that are prescribed off -label or experimentally for the 
treatment of alcoholism will be included in the Manual of Procedures and updated during the study if new drugs are identified. Also, if a subject reports using a drug or having been prescribed a drug to treat alcoholism during the trial, they will be asked to discontinue its use. 
Subjects will be instructed to check with study staff before taking any new medications or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_566029]. Subjects will be informed that starting any new medication without consulting study staff could pose health risks and/or result in their discontinuation for the

to C-SSRS questions 1 or 2 is “yes”).  
Note: The MINI suicidality module rates scores of 1 to 8 as a diagnosis of low 
risk of suicidality. As the MINI questions that could result in a low risk score are considered inadequate to fully determine the potential suicidal risk of an individual (e.g., “Feel hopeless” and “Think that you would be better off dead or wish you were dead?” responses of “yes” dictates  a score of 1 for each question), 
any subject who scores in the low risk category should be evaluated further by a study physician who should document whether the subject is appropriate for study inclusion based on his/her clinical judgment of the potentia l suicide risk of the

8.6. Measures Taken to Minimize/Avoid Bias  
8.6.1. Randomization  (Day 1)  
If eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized in an approximate 1:[ADDRESS_952241] will be randomized with the next 
randomization sequence at the time he/she is randomized at that site. Likewise, if the subject was randomized and then is determined to not be eligible for the study, and never received study drug, then another subject will be randomized such that the total numbers of subjects who were 
eligible, randomized, and dispensed study drug me et the enrollment goals. In the case of a 
subject who was eligible, randomized, and dispensed study drug but did not return for follow -up 
visits, this subject will not be replaced. Any subject who received study drug but was later determined to be ineligib le will likewise not be replaced. The reason(s) that a subject was 
considered a randomization failure or screen failure will be documented in source documents and 
CRFs.  
8.6.2. Blinding  
Varenicline and placebo capsules  will be identically matched in appearance and  the blister cards 
labeled not to reveal the drug identity. The site investigator or designated approved study physician will make the decision to un -blind the identity of the investigational product in the 
event that the study blind needs to be broken to make medical decisions regarding subject treatment. If it is determined that unblinding is necessary to assess AEs or SAEs for expedited reporting, NIAAA may decide to request unblinding of a subject. The site investigator will 
automatically notify the NIA AA that a subject was unblinded who will notify the Medical 
Monitor. 
Varenicline – Human Laboratory Paradigm  HLAB, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 (21FEB17 ) [ADDRESS_952242] is randomized, he/she will receive the first blister pack of study drug. Site staff 
will explain the dosing plan to the subject.  
Every study subject will be provided with a wallet card and instructed to carry this card that 
identif ies the potential investigational products that s/he could be taking during the study. The 
card will provide the name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 24- hour phone number of the investigator (physician) at the site 
who can be contact[CONTACT_566082]. The card will also  instruct the non- study 
physician rendering emergency care to contact [CONTACT_527952]/her about the 
care.  
If possible, clinic visits should be scheduled on the same day of the week that the subject 
received the first dose of study drug, but a [ADDRESS_952243] (e.g., 
for reasons related to patient non- compliance with the study schedule). Each subject will receive 
a visit schedule to take home for future reference.  
8.8. Weeks [ADDRESS_952244] to escalate dose to 1 mg, BID the next day, Week 2, Day 1. The same assessment will be performed on during Week 1 phone contacts as all other telephone 
contacts ( see section 8.10 ).

During Study Weeks [ADDRESS_952245] me ets the BAC requirement of a BAC ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_952246] visit, take vital signs, administer questionnaires (CIWA -AR and C -SSRS), inquire 
about other medication use and assess drinking by [CONTACT_101608]. Pregnancy test for women of child-
bearing potential and birth control methods (if female) will be collected in accordance with the 
schedule in  Table 1. In addition, subjects will complete the battery of questionnaires in 
accordance with the schedule in  Table 1.  
A reminder telephone assessment will occur [ADDRESS_952247] dose of study drug.  
Varenicline – Human Laboratory Paradigm  HLAB, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 (21FEB17 ) [ADDRESS_952248] will 
be instructed to bring the blister cards with them to the next visit so the site staff can perfor m 
drug accountability ( capsule counts). The subject will also be instructed to contact [CONTACT_701464]. 
Additional in -clinic visits are permitted under the protocol, if need ed, due to the following 
circumstances: (1) the subject has concerns either about the medication or their drinking and 
wishes to be seen at a time other than their next scheduled in -clinic visit, or, (2) the subject has 
missed a visit and wishes to resume regular participation before their next scheduled visit, (3) the subject has reported some change in health, functioning, or circumstances which necessitate a visit to conduct safety assessments and evaluate the risk of continued participation in the trial , or 
(4) clinical laboratory measurements need to be repeated.   
Subjects desiring additional counseling or professional therapy for non -crisis psychiatric matters 
(e.g., marital problems, work issues) should be encouraged to postpone such activity until t heir 
study participation is concluded.  
8.10. Telephone Assessments  
The brief telephone interview (approximately 10 minutes) will occur in accordance with the schedule in Table 1. or if a subject misses a clinic visit but agrees to check -in by [CONTACT_701465], concomitant medication use and the emergence of withdrawal symptoms, to encourage the subject to cont inue taking investigational products, to verify that the subject is 
taking the prescribed dose, and to remind the subject of the next scheduled visit and dose 
increases. A summary of the telephone script follows:  
1. AEs: An open- ended question will be asked a s follows: “How have you been feeling 
since your last clinic visit or phone contact?” If the subject reports a new AE, the resolution of an AE, or a change in the severity of an AE, ask additional questions to 
determine the severity and dates of occurrence or resolution.  
2. CIWA -AR: Subjects will be assessed for the emergence of withdrawal symptoms using 
the CIWA -AR. The subject may be asked about changes in drinking status after 
responses to the CIWA -AR interview indicate significant withdrawal.  
3. Concomitant Medications: Ask the following question: “Have you taken any new 
medications since you were last seen in the clinic or since our last call? If the subject 
responds affirmatively, record the name [CONTACT_11889], the daily dose, route of administration, a nd reason used. If the medication is contraindicated for the study, then 
notify a study physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant for follow -up with the 
subject.  
4. Drug Compliance: Verification that the subject is taking the prescribed dose and a  
reminder to take investigational product and to return the blister card(s) with untaken capsules  at the next visit will be made. During the Week 1 telephone contacts (Day 3 and 
Day 7), the subject will be reminded of the drug escalation schedule.

within the visit week if they have a conflict. During the Week [ADDRESS_952249] fulfill the following criteria before conducting the HLAB session : 
Subjects must fulfill the following criteria before conducting the HLAB session:  
1. Must have taken at least 0.5mg per day during the [ADDRESS_952250] BAC = 0.[ADDRESS_952251] 3- days of self -reported abstinence prior to the HLAB day (TLFB). 
4. Must have CIWA score < 8.  
 
If any of the above conditions are not met, then the lab session cannot be conducted at that visit.  
If the subject  failed for any of the reasons above , they can be rescheduled for another  lab session 
visit in order meet the meet the required conditions, and only if  lab session occurs no more than

provided.   
Laboratory sessions should occur in the late  afternoon if possible . Upon confirmation of 
eligibility  for the conduct of the HLAB test  and completion of clinica l assessments, subjects will 
be escorted to a comfortable chair in a lighting -controlled, sound- attenuated room for alcohol 
exposure. A 3 affective image (positive, neutral, negative affect) X 2 beverage (alcohol, water) 
within -subjects, block factorial de sign (6 repeated measures) will be employed for the cue 
reactivity manipulation.  All six mood -beverage combinations will be presented to each subject.  
For each of the six cue combinations, a computer screen displays the appropriate 
emotion -evoking affective images, followed immediately by [CONTACT_701466]’s favorite 
alcoholic beverage or water such that the subject will see, touch, and smell  the beverage, but  not 
drink. The affective pi[INVESTIGATOR_701427] a large screen directly in front of the participant, and includes positive (e.g. adventure sports, intimate kissing), negative

pi[INVESTIGATOR_298976], the computer display goes blank, and subjects are then presented with either their preferred alcoholic beverage (e.g. vodka, lager beer) or bottled water. The alcohol or water 
beverage is presented in the subject’s preferred mode of consumption (e.g., small tumbler for 
vodka, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_527907]) , and subject is instructed to hold and smell the beverage for 90 
seconds . Specific alcohol brand preferences are accommodated  whenever possible, including

Subjects will be instructed to “focus on the sensation you have while smelling the alcohol or 
water  beverage and continue to feel the mood stirred up in your imagination by [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_701430].” The beverage cue exposure period will last for 90- seconds. Following the 
beverage exposure period, the beverage will be removed. Subjects then wil l complete all 
subjective craving and other ratings by [CONTACT_701467].  The procedure will be repeated for the remaining mood -beverage combinations. 
Order of affect -beverage combinations will be determined by [CONTACT_22123] -generated randomization 
code to control for potential order effects  – see HLAB Testing Day protocol .  Data will be 
collected in response to each affect -beverage pair.  Upon completion of all six reactivity

The daily dosage of investigational product may be reduced by [CONTACT_701468], by [CONTACT_5989], to compromise the subject’s ability to maintain activities of  
daily living or if the subject reports undue discomfort. The dose may be reduced to 1 mg once 
daily or 0.5 mg once daily. If the AE resolves at the lower dose, another attempt to increase the 
dose to the target of 1 mg twice daily is appropriate at the ph ysician’s, nurse practitioner’s, or

Confidential   10. Safety Monitoring Plan  
Safety monitoring will be conducted throughout the study; therefore safety concerns will be 
identified by [CONTACT_218909], clinic staff, clinic al monitor, medical 
monitor, and NIAAA.  
The IRB, Medical Monitor, PI, Clinical Monitors and NIAAA (or its affiliates) will review any safety concerns throughout the trial. In addition, a data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will 
participate in this stu dy. The roles of these individuals/committee are described below.  
Medical Monitor:  A Medical Monitor has been appointed by [CONTACT_566085]. The 
Medical Monitor will be available for making recommendations to the investigator and NIAAA on the severity of any SAEs, and the relatedness to the study interventions. The Medical Monitor 
will also be responsible for tracking and assessing trends in the AEs reported.  
Clinical Monitors : All investigators will allow representatives of NIAAA to periodically 
monito r, at mutually convenient times during and after the study, all study data. These 
monitoring visits provide NIAAA with the opportunity to evaluate the progress of the study and 
to obtain information about potential problems. The monitors will assure that s ubmitted data are 
accurate and in agreement with any paper source documentation used; verify that investigational products are properly stored and accounted for, verify that subjects’ consent for study participation has been properly obtained and documente d, confirm that research subjects entered 
into the study meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assure that all essential documentation required by [CONTACT_20148] (GCP) guidelines are appropriately filed. 
Monitors will conduct a site initiatio n visit prior to the start of the study. At this visit, they will 
assure that proper study -related documentation exists, assist in training investigators and other 
site personnel in study procedures and GCP guidelines, confirm receipt of study supplies, and 
assure that acceptable facilities are available to conduct the study.  
Routine monitoring visits by [CONTACT_50533]’s representatives will be scheduled at appropriate intervals 
but more frequently at the beginning of the study. A monitoring visit soon after the fir st two 
subjects have been randomized is planned. At these visits, the monitors will verify that study 
procedures are being conducted according to the protocol guidelines, monitor CRFs against 
source documents, review AEs and SAEs, and perform drug accounta bility. At the end of the 
study, they will confirm that the site has the appropriate essential documents on file, advise on 
storage of study records, and inspect the return and destruction records for unused investigational 
products.  
DSMB : An independent DSMB of external advisors will meet prior to the start of the study, and 
every [ADDRESS_952264] will be blinded to subjects’ actual randomized group assignments but may request at any 
time that the blind be broken by [CONTACT_68707], if concerns arise from the blinded data. Ad hoc 
meetings will be convened if SAEs occur that are considered at least possibly related to the 
investigational product. 
11. Assessment  Methods  
All study  assessments will be performed at the visits and time points outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1); the following sections outline the deta ils and procedures associated with 
Varenicline – Human Laboratory Paradigm  HLAB, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 (21FEB17 ) [ADDRESS_952265] completed questionnaires.  
11.1. Alcohol Breathalyzer  
An alcohol breathalyzer will be administered at consent, at screening, and at every in -clinic visit 
as a safety measure. Acceptable BAC level at consent and HLAB (Week 3, the day of HLAB 
testing) is equal to 0.[ADDRESS_952266] a causal relationship with the administered treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended s ign 
(including a clinically significant laboratory abnormality), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product , whether or not related to the investigational 
product . Pre-existing conditions, diseases, or disorders ar e not considered AEs unless there is a 
change in severity or  frequency.  
11.2.2. Serious Adverse Events and Serious Unexpected Adverse Events Definition  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that meets one of the following:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (at the time of the event)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148078]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
A serious and unexpected AE is an SAE that is not identified in nature, intensity, or frequency in the ri sk information included in the Product Label for  the drug.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse dru g experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the study subject  and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  
11.2.3. Methods/Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyz ing Safety Endpoints  
AEs will be assessed at study visits starting after the first administration of investigational 
product  until the final follow -up visit. However, SAEs will be collected from the time of 
informed consent onward. General symptoms will be  collected  via an open ended question: 
“How have you been feeling since your last visit  or the last time we spoke ?”  
Varenicline – Human Laboratory Paradigm  HLAB, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 (21FEB17 ) 43 NIAAA 
Confidential   AEs will be documented in the source records, and recorded on the CRFs using accepted medical 
terms and/or the diagnoses that accurately ch aracterize the event. When a diagnosis is known, the 
AE term recorded on the CRF will be the diagnosis rather than a constellation of symptoms. The investigator will assess all AEs for seriousness, relationship to investigational product, and severity. Whe n an event has not resolved by [CONTACT_138114], it will be documented on the AE CRF 
as “ongoing”.  
If a woman has a positive or borderline pregnancy test after enrollment, the NIAAA Medical Monitor will be contact[CONTACT_566089] . The site will contact [CONTACT_216740]’s status until the pregnancy has been terminated or completed. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the NIAAA Medical Monitor without delay within 24 hours of knowledge of the event if the outcome is a SAE (e.g., 
death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the 
mother or newborn).  
All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regar dless 
of severity, will be followed by [CONTACT_218911] (the event either 
resolved or stabilized and is not expected to resolve in the near term). AEs must be reported up to [ADDRESS_952267], AEs will be recorded and followed to resolution only if they 
are serious, or if the study physician assesses them to be clinically significant.  
11.2.4. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments  
Abnormal clinical laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry) or other abnormal assessments 
(e.g., from vital signs or ECG), judged as clinically significant by [CONTACT_701471], if they meet  the definitions provided in Section 11.2.2. Abnormal 
laboratory or other findings present at baseline that significantly worsen following start of t he 
study will be reported as AEs or SAEs. Abnormal findings present at the start of the study that 
do not worsen will not be reported as AEs or SAEs, unless the investigator or designee judges them as more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.  
11.2.5. Classification of Adverse Event Intensity and Relationship to Investigational 
Product  
For each recorded AE or SAE, a physician - investigator must make an assessment of severity . 
For those AEs included in the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Cr iteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.03), these severity criteria will apply. For those not lis ted in 
the CTCAE, the following criteria  will be used : 
Mild:  An event that is usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and does not generally interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
Moderate:  An event that interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject . The event is usually ameliorated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention.  
Severe:   An event that interrupts usual activities of daily living or significantly 
affects clinical status. The event poses a significant risk of harm to the 
Varenicline – Human Laboratory Paradigm  HLAB, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 (21FEB17 ) [ADDRESS_952268]  based on 
the following criteria:  
Unrelated:  The subject did not receive the investigational product, the temporal 
sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the 
investigational product is not reasonable, or there is another obvious cause of the AE/SAE.  
Unlikely:  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational  product but  there is 
another more likely cause of the AE/SAE.  
Possible:  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal 
sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product is reasonable, but t he AE/SAE could have been due 
to another equally likely cause.  
Probable:  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal 
sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product is reasonable, and t he AE/SAE is more likely 
explained by [CONTACT_218913].  
Definite  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational p roduct is reasonable, the AE/SAE is more likely explained 
by [CONTACT_218913], and the AE/SAE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the investigational product or investigational product class.  
11.2.6. Outcomes and Actions Taken  
All unresolved AEs will be followed for a minimum of 14 days (unless the AE is an ongoing 
pregnancy which must be followed to conclusion) after the subject ’s final study visit, unless the 
investigator’s judgment dictates otherwise, the ev ent has resolved or stabilized prior to the 14-
day period, or the subject  is lost to follow -up.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study subject s that occur 
following the follow -up period.  
For each recorded AE or SAE, the investigator must make an assessment of outcome at the time 
of last observation, as follows:  
Fatal:  The subject  died.  
Resolved  without S equelae:  The AE or SAE has ended. 
Varenicline – Human Laboratory Paradigm  HLAB, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 (21FEB17 ) 45 NIAAA 
Confidential   Resolved with Sequelae : The AE or SAE has ended but changes are noted from 
baseline.  
Unresolved – Ongoing:  The AE has not ended and is ongoing at the end of the 
reporting period (i.e., 14 days after the final Follow -up visit) 
and the investigator deems that further follow up is not 
medically required  
Unknown – Lost to Follow -
up: Lost to f ollow -up after repeated unsuccessful attempts to 
contact [CONTACT_423] . 
Actions taken with respect to investigational agents (discontinuation or not) will also be 
recorded. In addition, if the AE was treated (medications or other physical measures), this will 
also be recorded.  
11.2.7. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. 24 hour Reporting Requirements (Initial Report)  
 Any SAE, including death due to any cause, which occurs to any subject from the time of 
admission through discharge whether or not rela ted to the investigational product, must be 
reported within [ADDRESS_952269] her as follows:  
Megan Ryan:  (301) 443 -4225 (office)  
The following information must be provided with the initial report of an SAE or unexpected AE:  
• Name [CONTACT_527967]/unexpected AE  
• Subject's I.D. number  
• Name [CONTACT_136269] [INVESTIGATOR_312331]  
• Date the subject signed informed consent  
• Date fi rst dose of investigational product was ingested 
• Description of the SAE/unexpected AE  
• Date and time of Onset  
• Date/time of administration of last dose of investigational product prior to the SAE/unexpected AE  
• Severity of the SAE/unexpected AE  
• Investigator's  assessment of the relationship of the SAE/unexpected AE to 
investigational product (related, possibly related, probably related, unlikely related, not related)  
• Any action taken with the investigational product, alteration to protocol defined schedule, dia gnostics, and treatments secondary to the SAE/unexpected AE.

These documents must be submitted by [CONTACT_527960].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting to the IRB  
Unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, SAEs related to participation in the study and all subject deaths should be promptly reported by [CONTACT_648], email, or fax to the local IRB.  
Investigators are required to forward safety information pr ovided by [CONTACT_1142]’s representative  
to the IRB . 
11.3. Alcohol Craving Scale  – Short Form – Revised  (ACQ -SF-R) 
The ACQ -SF-R contains 12- items adapted from the 47- item ACQ -NOW developed by 
[CONTACT_701474] (199 4) to assess cravin g for alcohol among alcohol users in the current context (right now). 
There are 4 subscale scores for compulsivity, expectancy, purposefulness and emotionality and a total score. Each item has a 1 to 7 raw score (from strongly disagree to strongly agree). The sum 
of the raw scores for each factor is  divided by 3 to yield a factor based score. Items 3, 8, and 11 
are reverse keyed. A general craving index is derived by [CONTACT_701475] 12. 
This form takes ~[ADDRESS_952271] and 
will be both the source and CRF. 
 
 
11.4. Alcohol Cue Human Laboratory (HLAB testing)  
Subjective Measures  
Alcohol craving in response to each affect -beverage condition is assessed using four individual 
Visual Analog Scale items (VAS; endpoints marked with a 0 on the left indicating no craving, 
and a 20 on the right indicating severe craving) adapted from the ACQ ( Singleton et al (1994) ). 
The items represent expectancy for positive rein forcement (“Having a drink would make things 
just perfect”), strength of craving (“How strong is your craving to drink alcohol”), intent (“If I could drink alcohol now, I would drink it”), and lack of control (“It would be hard to turn down a drink right now”). These items will be assessed after each 12 -pi[INVESTIGATOR_701435], 
Varenicline – Human Laboratory Paradigm  HLAB, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 (21FEB17 ) 47 NIAAA 
Confidential   Week 3 and Week 6 visits to assess the degree of craving elicited during the cue reactivity 
paradigm.  
 
Emotional reac tivity will be assessed using the Self -Assessment Mani kin (SAM; Bradley and 
Lang, 1994). The SAM is a 9- point likert/cartoon figure used to assess three dimensions of 
affect: 1) valence (how happy or unhappy one is) and 2) arous al (calm or excited ). Subjects will 
be instructed to indicate, “How you are feeling right now.” Anchors for the valence dimension 
include: “u nhappy ” versus “happy .” Arousal anchors include: “ calm ” versus “excited .”  
The two SAM items will be assessed after each 12 -pi[INVESTIGATOR_701436] 3 and 6 visits 
to assess whether the intended emotional reactivity was achieved with during each pi[INVESTIGATOR_701437]. Following the Week 6 visit, the two SAM items will be presented after each pi[INVESTIGATOR_701438] . 
 The Emotional Behavioral Check questions are two 20- point VAS items to assess 1) “ How much 
did you like the beverage just given to you? ” and 2) “Watching the pi[INVESTIGATOR_701439] a 
STRONG emotion” (with a 0 on the left indicating “None” and a 20 on the right indicating “extremely strong”). The first item will be assessed after each 12 -pi[INVESTIGATOR_701440], Week 3 and Week 6 visits. The second item will be assessed during visits at which pi[INVESTIGATOR_701441] (Weeks 3 and 6). Collectively, these items further assess whether the int ended 
craving and emotional reactivity was achieved with during each pi[INVESTIGATOR_701437]. 
  All subjective measures will be recorded on a  CRF . The SAM post validation assessment will be 
recorded on both source and CRF. 
 
Affective Stimuli  
Positive, neutral, and negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_701442]  (IAPS) ( CSEA, 1994
). Two sets of 12 equivalent images are selected for each affective  
category (positive, negative, neutral), in order to reduce habituation across the 2 beverage  
conditions (alcohol and water). Thus, 24 pi[INVESTIGATOR_701443] . Prior 
work has verified that the selected affective slides are associated with the expected affective category (Mason et al -2008
). 
11.5. Brief Drinking Questionnaire  
If a subject has completed the human lab assessment and is withdrawn from the study early and 
is no longer participating in clinic visits or providing TLFB drinking data but is willing to be 
conta cted by [CONTACT_701476], then they will be asked a series of six  
questions that assess quantity and frequency of drinking, heavy drinking, and maximal drinking 
since the last day that non -missing TLFB data was provided. Phone cal ls will continue until the 
end of the treatment period, as deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_102], to obtain data on the secondary drinking endpoints. The rules regarding standard drinking units (SDU) applies. These data will be recorded on a source document and CRF . This does not apply to subjects who are willing to 
supply daily drinking data by [CONTACT_566104].

Version  4 (21FEB17 ) 48 NIAAA 
Confidential   11.6. Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol- revised (CIWA -AR) 
The CIWA -AR modified telephone version is an adaptation for telephone administrat ion of the 
CIWA -AR a brief 10 -item measure used to provide a quantitative index of the severity of the 
alcohol withdrawal syndrome ( Sullivan et al- 1989 ). The CIWA -AR has been used both in 
clinical and research applications and has demonstrated both reliability and validity ( Sellers et al -
1992 , Stuppaeck et al -1994 ). This questionnaire will be administered by a clinical staff member 
and subject responses will be r ecorded and will be both the source and CRF.  
11.7. Clinical Chemistry  
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at the clinical site’s local clinical laboratory. 
Laboratories performing these assessments should be directly regulated by [CONTACT_36460] ( CAP ) or Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act ( CLIA ) guidelines. The 
laboratory will need to provide a copy of current certification. All clinical laboratory data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_35955]. The total blood volume is approxi mately 
72 mL.  Additiona l laboratory samples may be taken at the discretion of the investigator if the 
results of any tests fall outside reference ranges or clinical symptoms necessitate testing to ensure safety. Clinical chemistry tests include: c reatinine , total bilirubin , ALT , AST, and GGT . 
Serum creatinine levels will be used to calculate creatinine clearance (CrCl) according to the 
Cockroft -Gault  (1976)
 formula as follows:  
 
Males  CrCl (mL/min) =  (140 – age in years) x body weight in kg  
72 x serum creatinine mg/dL  
 
Females  CrCl (mL/min) =  0.85 x (140 – age in years) x body weight in kg  
72 x serum creatinine mg/dL  
For any laboratory test value outside the reference range that the investigator considers  clinically 
significant:  
• The investigator will repeat the test to verify the out -of-range value  
• The investigator will follow the out -of-range value to a s atisfactory clinical resolution  
• A laboratory test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from the study or 
requires a subject to receive treatment will be recorded as an AE  
11.8. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS is a 4 -page form asking questions about suicidal ideation, intensity of ideation, and 
suicidal behavior developed by  [CONTACT_566100] ( Oquendo et al -2003 ). This scale is intended for use by [CONTACT_411974]. The 
questions contained in the C -SSRS are suggested probes. Ultimately, the determination of the 
presence of suicidality depends on clinical judgment. Training is required before administering 
the C-SSRS through a 30- minute interactive slide presentation followed by a question -answer 
session through the Columbia University Medical Center. Those completing the training are 
certified to administer the C -SSRS, and will receive a training certificate.  As the MINI will be 
used to establish subject initial eligibility with respect to suicidality, the “Since Last Visit” 
version of the C -SSRS will be used at each cl inic visit starting with Visit 1 at Week 1. At Visit 1, 
Varenicline – Human Laboratory Paradigm  HLAB, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 (21FEB17 ) [ADDRESS_952272] responses will be 
recorded on a CRF  and will be both the source and CRF. 
11.9. Cigarette Smoking Quantity- Frequency and Nicot ine Use Questionnaire 
A quantity frequency interview at baseline will include three questions to assess cigarette 
smoking behavior and other tobacco/nicotine containing products use during the study: 1) “Over 
the past week, on how many days did you smoke c igarettes?”, 2) “On the days you smoked 
during the past week, how many cigarettes did you smoke on average?”, and 3) “Have you used 
any other tobacco or nicotine containing products besides cigarettes in the past week (e.g., cigars, 
cigarellos, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], bidi s, or smokeless tobacco such as pan, chewing tobacco, or snuff, or nicotine 
replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_701444])?”. At each subsequent visit, the subject will be 
asked to provide the average number of cigarettes smoked per week since the last visit and about 
any nicotine use since the last visit. These questionnaire s will be completed by [CONTACT_701477]. 
11.10. Demographics  
Demographics data include the subject’s age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, 
employment pattern , occupation, and income level. These data will be collected by [CONTACT_566101] a 
source document  and onto a CRF.  
11.11. Drinking Goal  
A subject’s drinking goal will be assessed w ith a single question to determine the desire to 
completely abstain from drinking alcohol or reduce drinking without abstinence. The data will be 
completed by [CONTACT_1175] a CRF. 
11.12. ECG  
A 12 -lead resting ECG will be obtained. Any abnormalities will be noted  and an assessment of 
clinical significance will be done by a study physician.  
11.13. Ethylglucuronide  (EtG)   
The ethanol metabolite, ethyl glucuronide (EtG) will be assayed in urine samples  collected at 
screening, Week 3 and Week 6  in-clinic visit.  Week 3 and W eek 6 samples will be stored and 
frozen for future testing. EtG is a biomarker of recent alcohol consumption that provides an 
objective measure of abstinence ( Jatlow et al -2014 ).  
11.14. Eligibility Checklist  
The Eligibility Checklist which includes all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed in  
stages as follows: 1) after screening measures are completed and before scheduling the Study 
Day 1 visit and 2) prior to randomization on Study Day 1.  
Varenicline – Human Laboratory Paradigm  HLAB, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 (21FEB17 ) [ADDRESS_952273] will be queried for his/her impression of whether he/she was  
receiving varenicline or placebo, a question about desire to please people, and about outside 
drinking support services used during the study. This CRF will be used as the source document.  
11.16. Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence  
The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence will be used to assess smoking status and 
motivation to change smoking behavior at baseline ( Heatherton et al -1991 ). Th is questionnaire 
will be completed by [CONTACT_701478].  
11.17. Hematology  
Hematologic assessment at screening includes: hemoglobin, white blood cells  count , absolute  
neutrophil count , absolute  lymphocyte count , and platelets count. 
11.18. Locator Form  
After signing informed consent, subjects will be asked to provide names, addresses, and phone 
numbers of several friends and/or family members who can be contact[CONTACT_701479] (Locator Form). This locator form will be used to assist in contact[CONTACT_566112] -up. This form asks subjects his/her name, address, and phone number and to 
provide names, addresses, and phone numbers of several friends and family members who can be 
contact[CONTACT_566111]. This information is essential and will be collected 
during screening, and will be updated throughout the study as necessary. This information will 
remain exclusively at the site.  
11.19. Medical History  
A medical history will be taken for all po tential study subjects to assure medical fitness during 
screening. The medical history will be updated on the day planned for randomization by [CONTACT_701480] t he initial screening interview.  
11.20. Medication Adherence Questionna ire 
The Medication Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ) is a 4 -item measure of self -reported 
adherence. Since intentional nonadherence has been shown to be highly predictive of 
nonadherence during treatment and outcome (Toll et al., 2007 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17454716 ), the MAQ may be used as a co -variate. The 
assessment will be completed by [CONTACT_701481].  
 
11.21. Mini Cue Reactivity Session  
Subjects will be familiarized with laboratory procedures during a practice neutral- water cue 
reactivity session during screening. The methodology is presented in Mason et al (2009) . 
Alcohol craving in response to a water and favorite alcohol beverage cue  is assessed using four 
individual Visual Analog Scale items (VAS; endpoints marked with a 0 on the left indicating no 
craving, and a 20 on the right indicating severe craving) adapted from the ACQ ( Singleton et al 
Varenicline – Human Laboratory Paradigm  HLAB, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 (21FEB17 ) 51 NIAAA 
Confidential   (1994) ). The items represent expectancy for positive reinforcement (“Having a drink would 
make things just perfect”), strength of craving (“How strong is your craving to drink alcohol”), 
intent (“If I could dr ink alcohol now, I would drink it”), and lack of control (“It would be hard to 
turn down a drink right now”). Subject must have a  VAS craving rating on the VAS item, “ How 
strong is your craving to drink alcohol? ” of alcohol cue > 3 points higher than water cue during 
this Mini Cue session at screening to be eligible for the study.  
11.22. MINI  
The MINI (paper version  7.0) is a short structured diagnostic interview, developed jointly by 
[CONTACT_701482], for DSM -5 and ICD -10 psychiatric 
disorders ( Sheehan et al -1998 ). With an administration time of approximately [ADDRESS_952274] step in outcome tracking in non-
research clinical settings. Diagnoses recorded on the MINI will be recorded on the interview 
form and entered onto a CRF. The individual items of the Alcohol Use Disorder  Module will be 
also collected on a  CRF  in addition to all other diagnoses.  
11.23. Penn Alcohol Craving Scale  
The PACS is a five- item self -administered instrument for assessing craving  (Flannery et 
al-1999 ). Frequency, intensity, and duration of thoughts about drinking are assessed along with 
ability to resist drinking. The final item asks the responder to provide an average rating of his/her 
craving over the course of the past week. The questions on the PAC S use descriptors coupled 
with numerical ratings ranging from 0 to 6. This CRF  will be used as the source document. 
11.24. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_33548]  (PSQI)  
The PSQI  is a 19 -item questionnaire with 6 subscales (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, 
sleep du ration, habitual sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication and day ti me dysfunction) 
(Buysse et al -1989 ). Each subscale is rated from [ADDRESS_952275]’s overall 
sleep experience in the past [ADDRESS_952276] will be used (i.e., dipstick test), unless t he 
site IRB requires a blood -based assay. If applicable, subjects will be asked to sign a release of 
information form for study personnel to access medical records to obtain information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy that occurred during the study.  
The birth control assessment is designed to determine a female subject’s compliance with the 
birth control specifications detailed in the inclusion criteria.

Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 (21FEB17 ) [ADDRESS_952277] Compliance /Drug Accountability  
Drug accountability will be performed by [CONTACT_701483]. The amount dispensed, daily dose prescribed, and 
amount returned will be reconciled and recorded at each visit. The drug card will be reviewed for 
subject reported consumption of investigational product. If the subject reports m issing capsules  
that were not taken, these data will also be recorded and used to calculate total drug exposure. If 
the investigational product blister card was not returned, then the subject’s self -report of drug 
taken will be reported. If the study drug was discontinued, the reason for discontinuation will 
also be recorded.  
11.28. Profile of Mood State (POMS)  
The POMS measures dimensions of affect or mood ( McNair and Heuchert -2005 ). It consists of 
[ADDRESS_952278] responds according to a 5- point scale ranging from “not at all” 
to “extremely.” Six subscale scores will be computed for items grouped as follows: Tension-
Anxiety, Depression- Dejection, Anger -Hostility, Vigor -Activity, Fatigue -Inertia, and 
Confusion=Bewilderment. A total mood disturbance score will also be computed which consists 
of the sum of the 5 of the six subscale scores (the Vigor -Activity score is not included). This 
questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_701478]. 
11.29. Physical Examination  
A physical examination of the oral cavity, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, cardiovascular system, lungs, abdomen, extremities, skin, neuropsychiatric mental status and sensory/motor 
status, musculoskeletal system and general appear ance will be performed during screening. The 
physical exam will be updated on the day planned for randomization by [CONTACT_701484]. Weight ( kg) will be also be 
collected.  
11.30. Mood, Behavior/Thinki ng, Suicidality, and Increased Intoxicating Effects of 
Alcohol  
Neuropsychiatric symptoms related to suicidality, mood, and behavior/thinking will be assessed every week at the clinic or via telephone. The mood and behavior/thinking questions have been 
adapted from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Mood and behavior/thinking changes will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_701485].  
The mood questions are:  
1. How has your mood been since we last talked?  
a. In particular, have you or your family noticed that you are more  hostile?  
b. Have you or your family noticed that you are more easily agitated?  
c. Have you or your family noticed that you are depressed?

2. Have you been hearing voices or seeing things that others do not hear or see?  
3. Have you had any thoughts about harming anyone?  
4. Have you come to believe that people are spying on you, or that someone is plotting 
against you, or trying to hurt you?  
NOTE : ASK FOR EXAMPLES TO RULE OUT ACTUAL STALKING . 
An answer of Yes to any of the above questions requires physician notification and evaluation, notation in the progress notes . If the physician determines this is an AE, an AE CRF should be 
completed.  
11.31. Screen Failures Documentation  
To document the reason that a subject who consented to the study was not randomized, an Eligibili ty Checklist CRF s will be completed for these subjects.  
11.32. Self-Reported Habit Index  
Self-report Habit index (SRHI ) (Verplanken and Orbell, 2003) is a  12-item self -report that 
provides an index of the degree to which alcohol drinking is habitual based on features of habit  
and expressing identity. It may be used as a co -variate.  This assessment will be completed by 
[CONTACT_701481].  
11.33. Subject Disposition  
A subject disposition CRF will be completed for all subjects who are randomized to the study 
and who are dispensed investigational product. This CRF will be used to record the following 
data as applicable: 1) completion status of the subject at the end of their participation and if they 
were discontinued early, and reason for early discontinuation. 
Completion status is as follows: 
1. Subject completed full study (i.e., telephone contact [CONTACT_566118] s 9 follow -up). 
2. Subject completed  the full interventio n phase of the study (i.e., subject came to Week 7 
clinic visit).  
3. Subject was withdrawn  prior to the Week 7 visit (reasons for early withdrawal are to be 
specified).  
4. If the subject d iscontinued study medications.  
Even if the subject had investigational product suspended for any reason but attended clinic visits, the above definitions still apply.  
In addition, if the subject was confined and/or incarcerated at any time during the study, the dates 
of confinement and/or incarceration will be collected.

Confidential   11.34. TLFB In terview  
Drinking behavior will be assessed using the TLFB methodology ( Sobell & Sobell -1992 ). The 
TLFB is a semi -structured interview that provides estimates of the daily quantity of alcohol 
consumption during specified time periods. It uses a calendar prompt and a number of other 
memory aids (e.g., holidays, payday, and other personally relevant dates) to facilitate accurate recall of drinking or other drug use during the target period. The procedure has been widely used 
in clinical and research contexts. It has demonstrated adequate levels of reliability and validity 
when administered as an in -person interview, over the telephone, and when administered via 
computer (
Carey -1997, Sobell et al -1988, Sobell et al- 1996 ). After consent is signed, the TLFB 
interview will be performed for the 28- day period prior to signing consent. Thereafter, the 
interview will be for the previous days between the  last assessment and the day prior to the day 
of the assessment. It is estimated that a [ADDRESS_952279] drink units (SDUs). This spreadsheet will be reviewed, compared wi th source 
documents and collected by [CONTACT_566119].  
Drinking  days are defined as the number of days in which the subject reported any alcohol 
consumption (i.e., > [ADDRESS_952280] drinking units [SDUs]) . A standard drink contains approximately 
0.6 fluid ounces (oz) of pure alcohol. The data given by [CONTACT_701486](s) consumed will be converted to SDUs. Standard drink unit definitions are provided in  Table 4.

11.36. Varenicline Plasma Levels  
Blood samples for determining plasma levels of varenicline will be collected at Weeks 3 and 7 to  
for medication compliance. If the blood collection is missed at Weeks 3 or 7, then the sample 
will be collected at the next blood draw (either visit make -up or Study Week 8). Blood will be  
collected in 6 mL Vacutainer™  tubes containing K
2-EDTA anticoagula nt. Plasma will be  
collected after centrifugation and two aliquots of each subject’s plasma will be stored at - 20°C 
until the completion of the study. One aliquot of each replicate plasma sample will be shipped on 
dry ice to the testing lab at the end of the study for analysis.

Confidential   12. Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size  
12.1. Statistical Hypotheses  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  Subjects treated with varenicline will report significantly lower 
VAS craving ratings in response to in vivo  alcohol cues during human lab testing than placebo-
treated subjects.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  It is hypothesized that, during the last 4 weeks  of the 
maintenance phase of treatment, the varenicline group, as compared to the placebo group, will:  
1. Increase the percentage of subjects with no heavy drinking days. A “heavy drinking day” 
is [ADDRESS_952282] a WHO 1 -level decreas e in alcohol 
consumption 
5. Increase the percentage of days abstinent per week  
6. Decrease the percentage of heavy drinking days per week  
7. Decrease the percentage of very heavy drinking days per week  
8. Decrease the weekly mean number of drinks per week  
9. Decrease the weekly mean drinks per drinking day  
10. Decrease the weekly mean cigarettes smoked per week among smokers  
11. Increase the percentage of subjects abstinent from nicotine use among subjects who used 
any nicotine products in the week before randomization 
12. Decrease t he mean alcohol craving score (PACS)  
13. Decrease the mean PSQI score  
14. Decrease total mood disturbance (POMS)  
12.2. Analysis Populations  
The study analysis populations will consist of the following:  
Modified Intention- to-Treat (mITT) Analysis Set : The mITT set is defined as subjects 
randomized to participate in the study that  took at least one dose of investigational product and 
had at least one non -missing VAS craving primary endpoint (completed human laboratory 
assessment).  
Evaluable Analysis Set:  The evaluable analysis set for the secondary endpoints is defined as 
those subjects randomized to the study who took at least 1.[ADDRESS_952283] 80% of days 
in Weeks 2 -6. All evaluable analysis sets will exclude subjects with a major protocol dev iation.  
Varenicline – Human Laboratory Paradigm  HLAB, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: HLAB - 001 
Version  4 (21FEB17 ) 57 NIAAA 
Confidential   Safety Analysis Set:  The safety analysis set includes all subjects who received at least one dose 
of investigational product.  
Both the primary and secondary efficacy analyses will use the mITT and the secondary efficacy 
analysis will use the evalu able analysis set. Safety analyses will be conducted on the safety 
analysis set.  
12.3. General Approach  
For descriptive purposes, dichotomous and categorical variables will be presented as number of observations and percentages; continuous variables will be given as means, standard deviations (SD), median, minimum (min) and maximum (max). Statistical tests w ill be two -tailed at a 0.05 
Type I error rate. P -values for the primary and secondary endpoints of < 0.[ADDRESS_952284] to introduce covariat es into the primary analyses, or in secondary analyses, to obviate 
the likelihood that conclusions may be affected by [CONTACT_701487]. Endpoint data will also be screened for outliers and skewness. Appropriate non- parametric tests will be used to compare 
treatment groups on continuous baseline characteristics that are not normally distributed. 
Continuous endpoint data that are not normally distributed will be transformed. Cohen’s d will be used to calculate the effect size for means and Cohen’s h will be used t o calculate the effect 
size for proportions. Odds ratios will be provided for all dichotomous outcomes. 
12.3.1. Analysis Addressing the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
Repeated -measures mixed effects models will be used to examine drug -placebo differences in 
VAS craving  ratings in response to beverage exposure, where drug is treated as a fixed, 
between -subjects variable and beverage presentation is the repeat ed measure. Beverage will be 
considered a fixed, within- subjects variable and subject as a random effect.  
12.3.2. Secondar y Efficacy Endpoints Analysis  
Continuous secondary endpoints (percent heavy drinking days, percent very heavy drinking 
days, percent days abstinent, drinks per week, drinks per drinking day, number of cigarettes 
smoked per week, PACS, POMS, and PSQI score)  will be analyzed using a mixed -model 
repeated measures AN COVA controlling for site, nicotine use  in the week before randomization, 
and baseline drinking as fixed factors. Models will also include time by [CONTACT_264243]. Additional covari ates may be included that are significantly correlated with 
outcome and/or if there are differences across the treatment groups.  
Analysis of the dichotomous secondary endpoints (percentage subjects with no heavy drinking days, percentage subjects abstinent from alcohol, percentage of subjects achieving at least a one 
and two- level shift in WHO alcohol consumption, and no nicotine use during the last 4 -weeks of 
the maintenance period among subjects who used in the week prior to randomization) will be 
conduc ted via logistic regression. Covariates may be included provided there are a sufficient 
number of events. 
In general, no imputation for missing endpoint data will be performed. However, as a sensitivity 
analysis, missing drinking data for the secondary endpoint percent heavy drinking days will be 
handled in two ways as done by [CONTACT_701449] (2013)
: (a) by [CONTACT_701488] (b) by [CONTACT_326491]. The multiple imputation model will the same

presented by [CONTACT_701489][INVESTIGATOR_007]. Listings of each individual AE including start 
date, stop date, severity, relationship, outcome, and duration will be provided. Each AE (based 
on preferred terminology) will be counted once only for a given study participant. If the same 
AE occurred on multiple occasions, the highest severity will be assumed. Thus, study participants are not counted multiple times in a given numerator in the calculation of frequencies 
for a specific AE. Laboratory data, pregnancy test results, and alcohol breathalyzer results, 
psychiatric symptoms, and CIWA scores will be reported as summary statistics. The numbers and proportion of subjects who reported CIWA scores ≥ [ADDRESS_952286] re turned to baseline levels.  
12.5. Compliance and Participation Outcomes  
Medicati on compliance is defined as the amount of medication taken as a proportion of the total 
amount prescribed. Compliance will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_701490], reported taking varenicline, and had a plasma sample with 
detectable varenicline. The participation rate is the percentage of subjects with complete drinking data. Compliance and participation rates will be reported on a weekly basis and across the entire trial duration.  
12.6. Randomization Plan/Contr ol of Bias  
Permuted blocked random allocation of subjects to study groups will be used to balance groups with respect to nicotine use  versus no use in the week before randomization. Nicotine use  was 
selected since regular smokers may potentially derive mor e or less benefit from study medication 
and by [CONTACT_701491]. 
12.7. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size for the primary endpoint was based on a human laboratory study of varenicline 
reported by [CONTACT_701492] (2009)
 that found an effect size for VAS craving (Cohen’s d=0.95). This 
effect size is consistent with those derived from other human laboratory studies that used a similar experimental paradigm as the present study, but evaluated different medications: mifepristone (d=1.25) (
Vendruscolo et al -2015 ) and gabapentin (d=1.00) ( Mason et al -2009 ).  
With an intake sample of 48 subjects (24 per arm) and 16% attri tion, it is projected that the 
sample size for primary outcome analyses will be 40 (20 per arm). The alpha level for the primary analyses will be 0.05, two- tailed. The conservative effect size estimate is d=.95, per 
McKee et al  (2009) . Equal variances in both groups are assumed. These assumptions lead to a 
projected power of 83%.

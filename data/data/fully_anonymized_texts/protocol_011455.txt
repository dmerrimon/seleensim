Study  Objective(s)  Primary Objectives  
• To evaluate the activity of KD025 in subjects with steroid -dependent 
chronic Graft versus Host Disease ( GVHD ) and active disease in 
terms of partial response (PR) and complete response (CR), as 
defined by [CONTACT_941] 2014 National Institute of Health (NIH) Consensus 
Development Project on clinical trials in cGVHD  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of KD025 in subjects with 
cGVHD  
 
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate changes in cGVHD severity using the 
Physician -reported Global cGV HD Activity Assessment form (see 
Appendix A ) 
• To assess changes in symptom activity using the cGVHD Activity 
Assessment Patient Self -Report  
• To evaluate Failure -free Survival (FFS)  
• To evaluate changes in corticosteroid and calci neurin inhibitor (CNI) 
dose 
• To evaluate Duration of Response (DOR)  
• To evaluate response by [CONTACT_34565]  
• To assess the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of KD025 in subjects 
with cGVHD  
• To evaluate Overall Survival (OS)  
• To evaluate Time to Next Treatment (TTNT)  
• To evaluate the change in symptom burden/bother using the Lee 
cGVHD Symptom Scale  
 
Exploratory Objectives  
• To evaluate changes in the expression of several cytokines (including 
interleukin ( IL)-17A, IL -21, and IL -2) in plasma after KD025 
administration  
• To evaluate changes in percentage of immune -cell subtypes 
(including Th17 and regulatory T cells [ Treg ] cells) in whole 
blood after KD025 administration  
VV-CLIN-[ADDRESS_775369] ( IRB)/Independent 
Ethics Committee - (IEC)-approved informed consent form  (ICF)  and who 
have met all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. 
Approximately  48 subjects will be enrolled  to receive orally administered 
KD025 200  mg once daily ( QD), KD025 200 mg twice daily ( BID_, or 
KD025 400 mg QD. Study drug will be administered in  28-day cycles until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Subjects may receive 
study drug in the inpatient or outpatient setting.  
Cohort 1  16 subjects  200 mg KD025 QD  
Cohort 2 16 subjects  200 mg KD025 BID  
Cohort 3 16 subjects  400 mg KD025  QD  
BID = twice daily; QD = once daily  
Prior to enrolling subsequent cohorts, t he safety data in each previous 
cohort will be evaluated after [ADDRESS_775370] reached 2 months of treatment 
to assure there is no safety signal.  If ≥ 25% of subjects in a cohort 
experience a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) 
v4.03 Grade 2 liver toxicity or a CTCAE v4.03 Grade  3 (or higher) adverse 
event ( AE) in the same organ or body system, or if >  25% of subjects in a 
cohort are discontinued for toxicity that persists for [ADDRESS_775371] s in that dose 
cohort will be dose reduced.       
If ≥ 25% of subjects in the 200 mg QD cohort experience a CTCAE v4.03 
Grade 2 l iver toxicity or a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 (or higher) AE in the 
same organ or body system, or if >  25% of subjects in a cohort are 
discontinued for toxicity that persists for 14 days, then further dosing will 
not occur and the study will be terminated.  
Respon se criteria will be assessed on Day 1 of each cycle, starting at 
Cycle  2 Day 1 , as well as the end of treatment (EOT) visit using the criteria 
of [ADDRESS_775372] on Clinical Trials in cGVHD 
(CR, PR, or lack of response (unchanged, mi xed, or progression); see 
Appendix  B).

assessments will be performed on Day 1 of each cycle starting at Cycle 1 
Day 1  as well as the EOT visit using the Physi cian-reported Global Chronic 
GVHD Activity Assessment form (Appendix A),  cGVHD Activity 
Assessment: Patient Self Report, and Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale (see 
Appendices C  and D).

C29D1, C31D1, etc.), subjects will receive [ADDRESS_775373]  (IP) accountability.  Investigators 
and/or subjects have the option of coming into the clinic at one or more 
even cycles (ie, C26D1, C28D1, C30D1, etc .).  On even cycles, when 
subjects  do not come to clinic, the study staf f will contact [CONTACT_588798].  
Subjects will also undergo pre-specified safety assessments  throughout the 
study.   
Follow-Up Period 
Follow -Up visits will occur 28 days (± 7 days) after the last dose of study 
drug. Subjects will undergo physical examinations ( PEs); vital sign 
measurements; blood sample collection for hematology, chemistry, and 
pharmacodynamic ( PD) markers; urinalysis; ECGs; AE assessments; 
concomitant medication assessments; and pregnancy testing f or females of 
childbearing potential.  
Long -Term Follow -Up 
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_147464] 8 weeks and can be 
contact[CONTACT_28136], email , or postal mail to confirm survival status and 
the initiation of any anti -cancer treatment or any cha nges in treatment of 
cGVHD. This can also be confirmed from electronic medical records . 
Number of Subjects  Approximately 48 subjects (adult male and female) total will be enrolled 
(16 subjects in each KD025 dose cohort ).  
Approximate Duration 
of Subject Participation  After approximately 3 weeks for screening, study drug will be administered 
in 28 -day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs  
followed by  4 weeks  of follow -up.

new therapy if a new therapy is started earlier. This visit may be done 
within ± [ADDRESS_775383] liver toxicity may occur 
spontaneously after a few weeks of initiation of therapy .   
• When treatment -related Grade [ADDRESS_775384]  Grade 1, and study drug may 
be resumed at a reduced dose.   
• When treatment -related Grade [ADDRESS_775385] Grade 1 at which time study drug administration may resume at 
the same dose.   
• When greater than Grade [ADDRESS_775386] more than 14 days; subjects requiring pauses 
of more than [ADDRESS_775387] study in cGVHD, careful monitoring of all 
toxicities will be carried out. CTCAE v4.03 grading will be used for all 
AEs.  
Activity Evaluation  The primary activity outcome will be the percentage of subjects who meet 
the overall response  (OR)  criteria (PR + CR). This will be assessed overall 
(ie, any subject meeting the PR or CR criteria at any time point).  
Response criteria  and a ctivity  in terms of cGVHD severity will be evaluated 
on Day 1 of each cycle starting at Cycle 2 Day 1 using the 
Physician -reported Global Chronic GVHD Activity Assessment Form, 
while activity  in terms of symptom burden will be evaluated using the

 cGV HD Activity Assessment —Patient Self -report . Failure -free survival , 
Overall Survival, TTNT,  and changes in corticosteroid and CNI dose will 
be documented . Changes in symptom burden/bother will be documented  
using the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale. Compliance with  oral dosing will 
be confirmed using patient diaries.  
Pharmacokinetics  Blood samples (approximately 5 mL) for determination of plasma 
concentrations of KD025 and its metabolites, will be collected on Day 1 of 
Cycles 1  and 2 at the following time  points: Pre-dose (Time 0), and 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, and 6 hours after dosing (after first dose for subjects in the BID 
group). In addition, subjects will have samples collected pre-dose on Day [ADDRESS_775388] a total 16 samples drawn (80 mL).  
KD025 and metabolite c oncentrations will be used to calculate the 
following PK parameters: C max, Tmax, and AUC 0-6hr. 
Pharmacodynamics  All subjects will have PD blood samples drawn 4 times over the course of 
the study : Pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycl e 2 Day 1 (4 weeks), Cycle  4 
Day 1 (12 weeks)  and Cycle 7 Day 1 (24 weeks) . The samples will be 
analyzed to eval uate changes in the expression of several cytokines in 
plasma (including IL -17A, IL -21, and IL -2), and changes in percentages of 
circulating Th17 and Treg cells  in blood .   
Statistical Analysis  Four  populations will be included in the analysis of study d ata: 
• The modified intent -to-treat (mITT)  population will consist of all 
subjects who are enrolled  in the study  and receive at least 1 dose of 
study medication .   
• The safety population will consist of all subjects who receive at least 
one dose of KD025  
• The PK population will consist of all subjects who receive at least 
[ADDRESS_775389] -dose PK sample drawn  
 
All analyses of safety will be performed on the safety population while 
activity  will be performed on the mITT population.  
The primary activity  outcome will be the percentage of subjects who meet 
the OR criteria (PR + CR). This will be assessed overall (ie,  any subject 
meeting the PR or CR criteria at any time point).   
 
Assuming an underlying 25% rate for subjects to meet the OR, each 
treatment group of [ADDRESS_775390] s has an approximately 80% chance of having 
at least [ADDRESS_775391] s meet the overall response criteria, and approximately 
90% chance of at least 2 subjects meet the overall response criteria.  
 
The change in cGVHD severity will be evaluated using the 
Physician -reported Global cGVHD Activity Assessment form. The change 
in symptom burden will be evaluated using the cGVHD Activity 
Assessment - Patient Self -report.  Changes in symptom burden/bother will 
be documented  using the Le e cGVHD Symptom Scale and compared 
among KD025 treatment groups.  
 
VV-CLIN-[ADDRESS_775392] dose of KD025 to the 
start of additional systemic cGVHD therapy .  
 
Changes in corticosteroid and CNI dose will be evaluated and results will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Corticosteroids may be tapered at the 
discretion o f the investigator after 4  weeks of KD025 administration.  
 
The DOR is defined as the time of initial response until documented 
progression. Responses by [CONTACT_34565] (PR and CR) will be assessed 
based on the [ADDRESS_775393] on Clinic al Trials 
in cGVHD.  
 
The exploratory outcome variables are expression of several cytokines 
(including IL -17A, IL -21, and IL -2), and changes in percentages of 
immune -cell subtypes (including  Th17 and Treg cells ). Results will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_2948].   
 
Demographics, subject disposition, and screening and baseline 
characteristics will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_1570].  
 
Treatment -emergent AEs will be evaluated using the CTCAE v4.03. The 
secondary safety outcome will be the number (%) of s ubjects experiencing 
AEs overall. The total sample size of 16 subjects per KD025 dose group 
will provide >  90% probability of one or more KD025 subjects 
experiencing an AE that has an underlying rate of ≥  14% and >  80% 
probability of one or more subjects i n the study experiencing an AE that has 
an underlying rate of ≥  10%.  
 
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_486512] ( MedDRA®) System 
Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term  (PT), class ified from verbatim 
terms.   MedDRA® Version 20. [ADDRESS_775394] severe grade using a 5 -point scale (mild,

t1/[ADDRESS_775404] disease (cGVHD) remains a major complication of allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) occurring in approximately 50% of transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_588776]. Patients with cGVHD require prolonged 
immunosuppressi ve treatment for an average of 2 to 3 years from the initial diagnosis, with 
10% of those surviving for at least [ADDRESS_775405] demonstrated that a pro -inflammatory interleukin ( IL)-17-producing lineage 
of T cells termed Th17 is actively involved in the pathogenesis of cGVHD. The development and 
function of Th17 cells is dependent on activation of STAT3, and transcription factors RORγt and 
IRF4. Recent studies have demonstrated that aberrant activation of Rho -associated protein 
kinases 2 (ROCK2) leads to induction of IL -[ADDRESS_775406] a relative deficiency of regulatory T -cells ( Treg ). This deficiency 
appears to be a consequence of abnormalities in Treg homeostasis after HCT  wherein increased 
prolif eration of Treg s is not sufficient to compensate for reduced thymic output and increased 
susceptibility to apoptosis. Recent in vitro data indicate that KD025, a specific ROCK2 inhibitor, 
significantly reduced the production of IL -17 and IL -21 in CD4+ T ce lls in response to T cell 
receptor stimulation and positively regulated the suppressive function of Treg. Experiments in a 
mouse model of cGVHD show that KD025 can reverse lung pathology and improve pulmonary 
function tests  (PFTs) , decrease collagen deposi ted in the lungs, and decrease the number of 
germinal centers and frequency of T follicular helper cells in spleens. In a second rodent model, 
KD025 administration was effective in blocking the progression of chronic sclerodermatous 
GVHD. Thus , this study will evaluate the potential of KD025 to ameliorate the symptoms of 
cGVHD.

 4.2. Selection of Doses in this Study  
This study will evaluate KD025 at doses of 200 mg once daily (QD), KD025 200 mg twice daily 
(BID) , and KD025 [ADDRESS_775407] that the dose of 400 mg QD for 12 weeks is associated with clinical 
efficacy in psoriasis and is well tolerated.  
KD025 has a plasma elimination half -life of 5 -6 hours, indicating BID dosing may be nec essary 
for more consistent inhibition of ROCK2 in patients throughout a 24 -hour period , but whether 
BID dosing is more effective than QD dosing is unknown.  Thus, the optimal dosing frequency 
for KD025 will be examined in this study by [CONTACT_588799] 200 mg BID 
and 400 mg QD. Safety data from prior studies in healthy human volunteers evaluating doses of 
500 mg BID for 28 days support the use of 400 mg QD in this study . 
The Investigator’s Brochure  (IB) includes additional nonclinical an d clinical information about 
KD025 .  
4.3. Previous Clinical Experience with  KD025  
To date, there have been 6 Phase 1 trials conducted with KD025 in normal healthy subjects: a 
single -ascending dose (SAD) trial (2119 -09-01), a combined single - and multiple -ascend ing dose 
(SAD/MAD) trial (KD025 -101), a MAD trial with QD and BID dosing (KD025 -102), a 
placebo -controlled safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) study (KD025 -103), a food effect study 
(KD025 -105), and a PK study (KD025 -106) which compared a tablet formation with  capsule 
formulation of KD025 (final data showed that after a single dose of KD025 200 mg, KD025 was 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_588777] c apsule formulation under fed 
conditions ). A Phase 2a, open -label study in [ADDRESS_775408] -line therapy was recently completed (KD025 -205).  Additionally, a 
Phase [ADDRESS_775409] 
disease progression after 1 systemic therapy is currently on -going (KD025 -206).  
The SAD trial (SLx -2119 -09-01) assessed the safety, tolerability, and PK of KD025. The dose 
levels of KD025 tested were 20, 40, 80, and 160  mg. Thirty -two subjects were enrolled in 
4 sequential cohorts of 8 subjects , randomized  with 6 receiving drug and 2  receiving placebo  in

 each cohort . No treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to withdrawal, deaths, or 
serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in this trial. There were [ADDRESS_775410] had laboratory abnormalities during the dosing period or 
within 1  week after dosing. There were no changes in blood pressure or heart rate and no 
clinically significant QTcB  or corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula  (QTc[F]) 
parameters.  
KD025 was readily absorbed and was measured out to 24 hours in plasma. KD025 was the main 
analyte (>  90% parent derived area under the curve  [AUC ]) and KD025m2 was present at about 
5%, with KD025m1 < 1%. The half-life ( t1/2) of KD025 was approximately 5 –6 hours, 
supporting once - or twice -daily dosing.  
A combined SAD/MAD (KD025 -101) trial assessed the safety, tolerability, and PK of KD025 in 
healthy males with single doses followed by [ADDRESS_775411] (No. [ZIP_CODE]) was withdrawn because of  a TEAE that was considered not 
related to KD025 ( elevated blood creatinine phosphokinase [CPK] levels of moderate intensity).  
No clinically relevant clinical chemistry (apart from elevated [CPK] discussed above), 
hematology, coagulation, or urinalysis abnormalities were reported for any of the subjects. No 
clinically significant abnormalities were reported for any vital signs (systolic or diastolic blood 
pressure, or heart rate) or 12 -lead electrocardiogram  (ECG ) parameters and no subject had an 
abnormal physical examination  (PE) finding of concern.  
A MAD  trial (KD025 -102) was a single -center, placebo -controlled, double -blind, randomized 
(6:2) study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of KD025 administered for 7 days in up to 
32 healthy male and postmenopausal female subjects. This study enrolled 4 cohorts with 
8 subjects in each cohort (6 subjects received KD025 and 2 subjects received placebo). The dose 
regimens studied were 500, 800, and [ADDRESS_775412] 1 dose of study drug, and 31  subjects completed the study; all 
[ADDRESS_775413].  
Multiple escalating doses of KD025 ranging from 500 mg to 800 mg to 1000 mg QD and 500 mg 
BID for 7 days were generally well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were reported in this 
study. Five treatment -related adverse events ( AEs) were reported in 4 subjects (16.7%) receiving 
KD025, including upper abdominal pain and diarrhea in [ADDRESS_775414] (12.5%) receiving placebo. There were no 
treatment -related AEs in subjects receiving KD025 800 mg QD. No subjects discontinued study 
participation because of A Es. There were no clinically relevant changes and no clinically 
meaningful trends in hematology, chemistry , and urinalysis laboratory results attributable to 
study drug during this study. There were no SAEs or deaths.  
The following are PK conclusions  from  this study:  
• KD025 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_588778] ( Tmax) values ranging from 1.[ADDRESS_775415]-dose. 
• Median T max values after BID dosing were more variable and ranged f rom 4.[ADDRESS_775416] dose to 12.0 hours after the second dose.  
• Mean t 1/2 values were similar across dose levels for each day, with values ranging from 
4.55 to 5.76 hours for Day 1 and from 7.68 to 9.73 hours for Day 7.  
• Mean KD025 maximum concentra tion observed  (Cmax) and area under the curve from 
0 to 24 hours ( AUC 0-24hr)values generally increased in a less than dose proportional 
manner with the increase in QD dose level from 500 to 1000 mg.  
• Overall exposure (AUC 0-24hr) following BID dose administr ation of 500 mg of KD025 
was 1.9 - to 2-fold higher than the AUC 0-24hr after QD dose administration of 1000  mg

 was 500 mg. There were no TEAEs, no treatment -related AEs, SAEs, or deaths reported in this 
study.  
The following are PK conclusions from this study:   
• A high fat meal given [ADDRESS_775417] on the PK of KD025.  
• Plasma systemic exposure (C max and AUCs) of KD025 was approximately 3 –fold higher 
under the fed state compared with the fasted state,  and the median T max value was delayed 
by 2 hours with food.  
• Similar food effects were observed for metabolites KD025m1 and KD025m2 as for the 
parent drug.  
• The high fat meal increased systemic exposure (mean C max and AUC 0-t values) by

the subjects after 4 weeks of dosing with 200 mg of KD025 and improvement in the Physicians 
Global Assessment for psoriasis. Cytokine levels and expression associated with psoriasis were 
evaluated in pharmacodynamic (PD) whole blood samples and punch biopsies of select ed 
lesions, respectively, collected at baseline  and at the end of treatment. Eight subjects began 
treatment with KD025. Five SAEs were reported in this study and all [ADDRESS_775419]: Subject 001 -008 experienced Grade 2 vomiting (2 events), Grade 2 nausea (2 events), 
Grade 3 anastomotic ulcer (related to the subject's previous gastric by[CONTACT_4897]), and Grade 3 
kidney stones, none of which were assessed to be related to study drug (she was subsequently 
discontinued after 20  days of dosing). Another subject experienced reversible grade 1 elevated 
ALT and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) on Day 22 with no known etiology and permanently 
discontinued treatment with KD025. The ALT/AST returned to normal levels [ADDRESS_775420] dose of KD025.  No other TEAEs or SAEs were reported.

 Follow -up for efficacy and activity measures in this study  has completed . The following PK 
conclusions can be made for this study:  
• KD025 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_588779] T max values of

(200 mg BID, 400  mg QD, and 400 mg BID) of KD025 in subjects with psoriasis vulgaris who 
have progressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_588781] -line therapy. To date, preliminary safety data are available on 
[ADDRESS_775423] values during screening. Four 
subjects ([ADDRESS_775424] receiving 400  mg QD) had TEAEs of 
elevation of ALT or AST. Bilirubin levels remained normal, and all ALT or AST increases were 
asymptomatic and reversible. The ALT and AST elevations first occurred from study Day 16 to 
study Day 36. The ALT/AST elevations were mild or moderate in intensity, except in [ADDRESS_775425] 
who had severe ( grade 3) ALT elevation to a maximum of 377 U/L.  KD025 administration was 
discontinued in [ADDRESS_775426], who was receiving 
KD025 400 mg QD, had peak ALT of 121 U/L and AST of 127 U/L that then returned to the 
normal range despi[INVESTIGATOR_588782]025 [ADDRESS_775427] and may be reversible despi[INVESTIGATOR_588783]025.

cGVHD Activity Assessment to evaluate cGVHD severity; use the cGVHD Activity Assessment 
Patient Self -Report to assess symptom activity  (see Appendix C); evaluate FFS ; evaluate OS;  
assess chan ges in corticosteroid and calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) dose; evaluate TTNT ; and assess 
the PK of KD025 in subjects with cGVHD.  Changes in symptom burden/bother will be 
documented using the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale  (see Appendix D ). Changes in the expression 
of several cytokines ( including IL -17A, IL -21, and IL -2) in plasma  and percentage s of immune -
cell subtypes (including Th17 and Treg cells)  in whole blood after KD025 administration to 
subjects with cGVHD .  
Subjects who have sig ned an IRB/IEC -approved informed consent form, and met all of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria  (Section 7.2 and 7.3), will be enrolled. Approximately  48 subjects 
will receive orally administered KD025 200  mg QD (n  = 16), KD025 200 mg BID (n = 16), or 
KD025 400 mg QD (n = 16). Study drug will be administered in 28 -day cycles until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs . For disease progression,  subjects wit h a 
“Lack  of Response  (LOR)  – Mixed” response assessment ( Appendix B ) may continue treatment 
with KD025 and remain on study if the investigator considers continued treatment to be in the 
subject’s best interest, only after ap proval from the medical monitor  and documentation of the 
subject’s willingness to continue.  Subjects may receive study drug treatment either in the 
inpatient or outpatient setting.  
Prior to enrolling subsequent cohorts, the safety data in each previous cohort will be evaluated 
after [ADDRESS_775430] reached 2 months of treatment to assure there is no safety signal. As this is 
an open -label study, safety data will be continuously monitered. If ≥  25% of subjects in a cohort 
experience a Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v4.03 Grade 2 liver 
toxicity or a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 (or higher) AE in the same organ or body system, or if

 > 25% of subjects in a cohort are discontinued for toxicity that persists for [ADDRESS_775431] s in that dose cohort will be dose 
reduced.  
If ≥ 25% of subjects in the 200 mg QD cohort experience a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 2 liver toxicity 
or a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 (or higher) AE in the same organ or body system, or if >  25% of 
subjects in a cohort are discontinued for toxicity that persists for 14 da ys, then further dosing will 
not occur and the study will be terminated. See Section  14.4 for additional information.  
Response criteria will be assessed on Day 1 of each cycle starting at Cycle 2 Day 1 visit as well 
as the end of treatment (EOT) visit using the criteria of [ADDRESS_775432] on Clinical Trials in cGVHD  (CR, PR, and Lack of Response (unchanged, mixed, or 
progression) ; Lee et al ., 2015 ). cGVHD severi ty (clinician reported) and symptom (subject 
reported) assessment s will be performed on Day 1 of each cycle starting on Cycle 1 Day 1  as 
well as the EOT  visit using the Physician -reported global cGVHD Activity Assessment form 
(Appendix A),  cGVHD Activity Assessment: Patient Self Report , and Lee cGVHD Symptom 
Scale  (see Appendices C and D).  
At Cycle 25, Day 1 (C25D1), and all odd cycles thereafter (ie, C27D1, C29D1, C31D1 , etc.), 
subjects will receive 2 cycles worth of study drug along with 2 diaries and will return to the 
clinic at the next odd cycle for assessments and IP accountability.  Investigators and/or subjects 
have the option of coming into the clinic at one or m ore even cycles (i.e., C26D1, C28D1, 
C30D1, etc).   On even cycles, when patients do not come to clinic, the study staff will contact 
[CONTACT_588800].  
Subjects will also undergo assessmen ts as described in Table 1.

study days numbered sequentially thereafter.  
If significant changes from baseline are noted during the course of the study, additional 
unscheduled clinic visits may be undertaken by [CONTACT_17062], or requested by [CONTACT_456], in 
order to determine both the relevance of the finding(s) and the duration of the event(s).  
Informed Consent  
All subjects must take part in the informed consent process. Adequate time must be allowed for 
the subject to ask questions and make a voluntary decision. No protocol -specific procedures, 
including screening procedures are to be performed until the subject has signed and dated an 
IRB/IEC -approved ICF.   
Demographics and Medical History  
A complete medical history w ill be taken. Information to be documented includes demographic 
information, prior medical illnesses and conditions, and surgical procedures.  
Physical Examination  
Complete PEs will be performed. All PEs will include assessment of cardiac (including heart 
rate, and vital sign measurements), musculoskeletal (eg, muscle aches) and neurological (eg, 
gait) body systems. A complete PE is to include documentation of height (screening only), 
weight, body temperature, and vital signs (blood pressure [sitting], pulse  rate [sitting], Karnofsky 
Performance Scale, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) and will be performed by a physician or staff member 
who is qualified to perform such examinations (eg, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner).   
Any abnormal or clinically significant  findings from the PE must be recorded on the appropriate 
electronic case report form (eCRF) page.   
Vital Sign Measurements  
VV-CLIN-[ADDRESS_775450] has been sitting for 5 minutes. Vital 
sign assessments will include mea surements of sitting blood pressure (mm Hg), heart rate (beats 
per minute), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (breaths per minute), and temperature (Celsius).  
Please note that blood pressure measurements are to be performed using appropriate technique 
(per guidelines of th e American Heart Association). Specifically, subjects should be seated 
quietly for at least 5 minutes in a chair with their backs supported, their feet flat on floor (legs 
uncrossed), and their arms bared on a hard surface, with the arm slightly abducted a nd bent, with 
palm up and the midpoint of upper arm at heart level. Correct cuff and bladder size should be 
utilized. Two or more readings separated by [ADDRESS_775451]'s position (if not seated).  
Karnofsky Performance Scale   
Subject’s performance status will be assessed using the Karnofsky Performance Scale tool (see 
Appendix E ).  
Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory samples (hematology, serum chemistry, TSH, urinalysis, and virology) are to be 
collected as outlined in  Table 1and Section  8.8. Safety laboratory analyses will be performed by 
[CONTACT_2237]. Laboratory results will be graded using the CTCAE v4.03.   
12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiograms will be performed with the subject in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_588785] 5 minutes before each reading. ECGs are to be performed 3 times 
consecutively within 30 minutes (must have an interval of at least 1 –2 minutes between ECGs). 
ECG is to be performed immediately prior to any blood sample col lections, if possible. See 
Section 9.3 for additional ECG procedure information and Table 2 for timing allowances.  
Pregnancy Testing  
Pregnancy tests (urine) will be done  in women of childbearing potential. Positive urine results 
are to be confirmed with serum testing.

 Pulmonary function tests (to include FEV 1, FVC, DL CO, TLC, and RV) will be performed 
according to the guidelines published by [CONTACT_588802][INVESTIGATOR_588786]  (ATC 1995 ; Quanjer et al ., 1993 ). Diffusion capacity 
(DL CO) determinations will be performed at the same time  as spi[INVESTIGATOR_555628] ; FEV 1, FVC, 
DL CO, TLC, and RV will also be expressed as absolute values and % predicted of normal based 
on published reference values for adults  (Hankinson et al., 1999 ). See Section 9.4 for additional 
information.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) Sampling  
Blood samples (approximately 5 mL) for determination of plasma concentrations of KD025 and 
its metabolites, will be collected on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 at the follow ing time points : 
Pre-dose (Time 0), and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after dosing (after first dose for subjects in the 
BID group). In addition, subjects will have samples collected pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 4 and 
pre-dose at the Cycle 7 Day 1  visit. See Section 11 for additional information.  
Blood Sampling for Pharmacodynamics (PD)  
All subjects will have PD blood samples drawn up to 4 times over the course of the study: Pre -
dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1 (4  weeks), Cycle  4 Day 1 (12 weeks)  and Cycle 7 Day 1  
(24 weeks) .  Samples  will be analyzed to evaluate changes in the expression of several cytokines 
in plasma (including IL -17A, IL -21, and IL -2), and changes in percentages of circulating Th17 
and Treg cell s in blood.  See Section [ADDRESS_775452] dose of study drug in the clinic on Day 1 of Cycle 1, and then 
study drug will be dispensed for home administration. On scheduled visit days, subjects will take 
their dose at the clinic.  
Subjects will receive KD025 200 mg QD, KD025 200 mg BID, or KD025 400  mg QD. Subjects 
will be treated until disease progression  or unacceptable toxicity .  Subjects with a “L OR -
 Mixed” r esponse assessment may continue treatment with KD025 and remain on study if the 
investigator considers continued treatment to be in the subject’s best interest only after approval 
from the medical monitor and documentation of the subject’s willingness to c ontinue.  
VV-CLIN-[ADDRESS_775453] SD, PR, or CR at the time of decision to discontinue treatment and who come 
off study for reasons other than AEs will be tapered off of KD025 by [CONTACT_588803] 
50% every 2  weeks  (see Section 14.1 for additional details)  until they reach a dose of [ADDRESS_775454] the details of each dose of study drug. Diaries 
will be dispensed/collected  on Day [ADDRESS_775455] for 
Clinical Trials in cGVHD criteria (CR, PR, or LOR [unchanged, mixed, or progression ; see (Lee 
et al., 2015 ).     
Activity in terms of cGVHD severity will be evaluated using the Physician -reported Global 
cGVHD Activity Assessment  form (see Appendix A ), while activity in terms of symptom burden 
will be evaluated using the cGVHD Activity Assessment - Patient Self Report (see Appendix C ). 
Failure -free survival , OS and TTNT  will be evaluated at the same time points . Changes in 
corticosteroid and CNI dose will be documented as they occur on the appropriate eCRF . Changes 
in symptom burden/bother will be documented using the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale (see

 for the purposes of this study, and will be recorded on the AE eCRF page . Laboratory results will 
be classified using the CTCAE v4.03. If laboratory values constitute part of an event that meets 
criteria defining it as serious, the event (and associated lab oratory  values) must be reported as an 
SAE (see Section  16.3.1 ). 
9.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments  
A digital 12 -lead ECG will be obtained during the study (see  Table 1 for timing of ECG 
assessments  and Table 2  for timing allowances ). 
Digital [ADDRESS_775458] 5 minutes before each reading . ECGs are to be performed 
3 times consecutively within 30 min utes (must have an interval of at least 1 –2 minutes between 
ECGs). At each visit, the ECG is to be performed immediately before  any blood sample 
collection , if possible . 
The following ECG parameters will be collected: PR interval, QRS interval, and QTc[F]. The 
ECG findings will be evaluated by a qualified physician for the presence of abnormalities 
(qualitative assessment) . The physician will assess each ECG as normal, abnormal/not clinically 
significant, or abnormal/clinically significant.   
Abnormalities in the ECG that lead to a change in subject management (eg, dose reduction or 
delay, requirement for additional medication or monitoring) or result in clinical signs and 
symptoms are considered clinically significant for the purposes of this study and will  be recorded 
in the AE eCRF. If ECG abnormalities meet criteria defining them as serious, they must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 16.3.1 ). 
9.4. Pulmonary Function Test s  
Pulmonary function testing will include FEV 1, FVC, DL CO, TLC, and RV . The same equipment 
and tester should be used during the course of the study  to the extent possible . The person 
responsible for conducting the pulmonary function tests will be required to comply with the 
study guidelines and the  American Thoracic Society/European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_588787].

Blood samples (approximately 5 mL) for determination of plasma concentrations of KD025 and 
its metabolites, will be collec ted on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 at the following time  points: 
Pre-dose (Time 0), and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after dosing (after first dose for subjects in the 
BID group). In addition, subjects will have samples collected pre-dose on Day [ADDRESS_775464]’s dose of study drug is to be documented 
(for subjects receiving study drug BID, the time of the previous evening’s dose administration 
also is to be noted).   
A total of 16 samples will be collected ( 80 mL) from subjects in the dose es calation portion of 
the study . KD025 and metabolite concentrations will be used to calculate the following PK 
parameters: C max, Tmax, and AUC 0-6hr.

a subject is withdrawn from the study, every effort will be made by [CONTACT_588804]. This evaluation should include 
final observations, as required by [CONTACT_486517]’s withdrawal. The 
reason(s) for termination must be clearly documented on the appropriate page of the eCRF. A 
termination eCR F page must be completed for any subject who is enrolled in the study.  
13.1. Subject s’ Decision to  Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_8018].  
Subjects can decline to continue receiving study drug and/or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_331349]. If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the 
subject the appropriate processes for discon tinuation  from study drug or other protocol -required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_588788]  (Table 1) and collection of data, including endpoints and  adverse events.   
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further 
protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882], and the subject does not wish to or is unable to 
continue further study participation. Subject data up t o withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publically available data can be included after 
withdrawal of consent. The investigator is to discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for 
withdrawal from th e study.

13.3. Study Discontinuation  
Kadmon Corporation  has the right to terminate or to stop the study at any t ime. Reasons for 
study discontinuation may include, but are not limited to the following:  
• If ≥ 25% of subjects in the 200 mg QD cohort experience a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 2 liver 
toxicity or a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 (or higher) AE in the same organ or body system , or if 
> 25% of subjects in a cohort are discontinued for toxicity that persists for 14 days, then 
further dosing will not occur and the study will be terminated.    
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory  
• Drug supply  issues  
• Excessive subject self -withdrawal  
• Significant protocol violations ( eg, violation of eligibility criteria, dosing errors, missing 
data for study endpoint analysis)  
13.4. Replacements  
Subjects  withdrawn from the study before  receiving any study drug will be replaced by [CONTACT_588805] s into the study.

50% every [ADDRESS_775470] the day and time of dosing . Subjects will 
return to the clinic as outlined in the Study Assessments table (Table 1 ), and will receive that 
day’s dose of study drug (first dose for BID subjects) while at the clinic.  
14.2. Dose Escalation  
Prior to enrolling subsequent cohorts, t he safety data in each prior cohort will be evaluated after 
[ADDRESS_775471] reached 2 months of treatment to assure there is no safety signal. Two months 
was selected as the time for the safety review because all of the clinically significant 
KD025 -related AEs to da te occurred within 36 days or less  of starting dosing with KD025 . As 
this is an open -label study , safety results will be continuously monitered. If ≥ 25% of subjects in 
a cohort experience a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 2 liver toxicity or a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 (or 
higher) AE in the same organ or body system, or if >  25% of subjects in a cohort are 
discontinued for toxicity that persists for [ADDRESS_775472] misses the planne d dose of study drug, the following protocol should be 
followed:

 14.7. Dispensing of Study Drug and Dosing Compliance  
Subjects will be dispensed study drug to self -administer while on an outpatient basis. Subjects 
will return to the clinic as outlined in the Study Assessments ( Table 1), and will receive that 
day’s dose of study drug while at the clinic.  
The amount of study drug dispensed to the subject at the beginning of each dosing month  should 
be sufficient to allow for 1 month of dosing with KD0 25. 
The investigato r (or designee) will be responsible for recording this information on the 
appropriate study drug inventory. This inventory will be maintained throughout the duration of 
the trial and will be periodically reviewed by a representative of the sponsor.  
The inv estigator (or designee) will instruct the subject that all dispensed bottles must be returned 
at each follow -up visit, at which time a capsule /tablet  count will be conducted to assure subject 
dosing compliance.  
Additionally, subjects will be required to ke ep study drug diaries in which they will record the 
date and time of study drug administrations. These diaries will be dispensed and/or 
reviewed/ collected at each visit.  
14.8. Study Drug Storage  
All supplies of study drug are to be stored at USP controlled room temperature of 20−25°C 
(66−77°F)  with excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F). At the clinic, the 
study drugs are to be stored in a securely locked area, accessible to authorized persons only, until 
needed for dosing.  
14.9. Study Drug Accountability  
The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and other regulatory agencies require accounting 
for the disposition of all investigational drugs received by [CONTACT_108440]. Information on drug 
disposition required by [CONTACT_256562], date administer ed, quantity 
administered, and the subject to whom the drug was administered. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_588791]. The 
investigator must maintain a complete and current dispensing and inventory record that has been 
supplied by [CONTACT_456].  
VV-CLIN-[ADDRESS_775483]’s participation in the trial, all partially used  and empty  study drug 
containers must be returned to the investigator (or designee) so that a final subject -dosing 
inventory may be conducted. This information will be recorded on the Drug Dispensing Log .  
14.10.[ADDRESS_775484] received at the time 
of signing the ICF through the end of the study (follow -up visit). After discontinuation of study 
drug, any concomitant medication used during the study in response to an AE  is to be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF.  
Subjects must be receiving glucocorticoid therapy for cGVHD at study entry  (subjects also may 
be receiving CNI therapy) . Any changes in corticosteroid , CNI, or ECP  doses will be 
documented.   
Use of drugs that pr olong QT/QTc should be used with caution in subjects who are receiving 
KD025. Discuss with medical monitor the appropriate monitoring of subjects while receiving 
any of these drugs in conjunction with KD025.  
The concomitant medication names will be coded by [CONTACT_588807] (WHO -DD) and classified by [CONTACT_165023].  
The use of medications that are strong CYP3A4  inducers is prohibited.  Other CYP3A4 
inhibitors / inducers should  be used with caution.  (See Appendix H  for a listing of these drugs .) 
CYP1A2 inhibitors/ inducers should be used with caution.

 16. SAFETY  
16.1. Safety Parameters  
The CTCAE v.4.03  will be used for grading toxicities . Laboratory results  also will be classified 
using the CTCAE v4.03. Subjects will be monitored throughout the treatment and follow -up 
period for occurrence of AEs (acute, delayed, and/or cumulative), as well as for changes in 
clinical status, vital sign measurements, and labo ratory data. Safety parameters to be 
measured/assessed include vital sign measurements, PE finding s, hematology, serum 
chemistries, and urinalysis  results , and ECG  recordings . 
16.2. Adverse Event  Definition  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject associated with the 
use of a drug, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be an unfavorable and unintended 
sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory value finding), a symptom, or a disease temporally associated with 
the use of a drug, without judgment as to causality. An AE can arise from use of the drug (eg, use in 
combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation or dose, including 
an overdose. An AE also includes, but is not limited to, any clinic ally significant worsening of a pre -
existing condition. Examples include:  
• Any sign, symptom, physical finding, or laboratory result that has worsened in nature, 
severity or frequency compared to baseline;  
• Reactions from an investigational drug, including t hose occurring as a result of an 
overdose, abuse of the study drug, withdrawal phenomena, sensitivity or toxicity;  
• Concurrent illness that was not present or worsens in nature, severity, or frequency 
compared to baseline;  
• Injury or accident; and/or  
• Exacer bation of a pre -existing condition  
For the purpose of data collection, all untoward events that occur after informed consent through 
[ADDRESS_775485] dose of study drug are to be recorded on eCRF s by [CONTACT_2727] .

 16.3. Evaluating Adverse Events  
The investigator will determine the seriousness, intensity, and causality of an AE associated with 
the use of the study drug (ie, events where there is a reasonable possibility that the event may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]) bas ed on the definitions  that follow.  
16.3.1  Serious Adverse Events  
(Notify sponsor or designee within 24 hours)  
The SAE definition and reporting requirements are in accordance with Title 21 Part Code of 
Federal Regulations ( CFR ) 312.32 and the Guidance for Industry and Investigators Sa fety 
Reporting Requirements for Investigational New Drug ( INDs ) and 
Bioavailability /Bioequivalence  Studies.  
SAE: An adverse event is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
• Death:  This includes any death that occurs while the subject is “on study” as well as any death 
that occurs within 28 days after study drug discontinuation .  
Note : Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself. The event(s) that 
caused death ( eg, illness, accident) is the SAE. Death due to any other 
cause(s) must also be reported as an outcome of the reportable SAE.  
• Life-threatening AE:  An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in 
the view of either the investigator or  sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death .  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] e xisting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] :  In the absence of an AE, 
the investigator should not report hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]. This is the 
case in the following situations:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a proce dure required by [CONTACT_12695]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486501]

 In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_588793] y for a pre -existing condition 
which has not worsened does not count as a n SAE .  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical event:   An ev ent that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.   
16.3.2  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
(Notify sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_775486] awareness)  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction  is any adverse drug event, the specificity or 
sever ity of which is not consistent with those noted in the current protocol and/or IB. This refers 
to any AE that has not been previously observed (eg, included in the I B), rather than from the 
perspective of such an event not being anticipated from the pharma cological properties of the 
product.  
16.3.3  Unexpected Adverse Events  
(Notify sponsor or designee by [CONTACT_241565])  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB  or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed; or , if an IB is not required or available, is not consistent with the 
risk information described in the General Investigational Plan or elsewhere in the current 
application. Also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs o r 
as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation . 
16.3.[ADDRESS_775487] is participating in the study. For example, a protocol -related AE 
may be an event that occurs during a washout period or that is related to a procedure required by 
[CONTACT_760].  
16.3.6  Relationship to Study Drug  
The investigator will attempt to a ssess the relationship of the event  to study drug using a 5 -point 
scale (not related, unlikely -related, possibly related, probably related, or definitely related ; (see 
Appendix G ). 
16.3.7  Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs (including SAEs) are to be accurately recorded on the Adverse Event  page of the 
subject’s eCRF  during the subject’s participation in the study . The severity of each AE will be 
graded using the CTCAE v 4.03 scale . The date of onset as well as the end date of the event a lso 
should be recorded  or the event should be entered  as “ongoing” . In addition, the method used to 
treat the AE and the outcome of the AE also will be noted. In the event that the grade of an AE 
worsens , an end date should be entered to the initial AE and  a new AE entered with the updated 
grade and date of onset. The investigator will assess the relationship of the event to study drug. 
Note: All SAEs also are to be entered onto an SAE form and sent to sponsor or designee.  
16.3.8  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_588794], the investigator should not report hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135627]. This is the case in the following situations:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required by [CONTACT_12695].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_588795].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486502].  
In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112044] a pre -existing condition that 
has n ot worsened does not count as a n SAE .

 16.3.9  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Governing Regulatory Requirements  
Compliance with this request for prompt reporting is essential in that the sponsor is responsible 
for informing the US FDA as well as all other particip ating investigators of the event.  
Under FDA ruling (US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 CFR Part 312.32) and the 
Guidance for Industry and Investigators Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE 
Studies, the sponsor is required to submit writt en documentation, in the form of an IND safety 
report, detailing : 
• Any event associated with the use of the drug, that is both serious and unexpected, or  
• Any findings from clinical, epi[INVESTIGATOR_904], or pooled analysis of multiple studies or any 
findings fr om animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to 
the drug .  
Written submission must be made by [CONTACT_588808] /IEC s as soon as 
possible and in no event later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor’s ini tial notification of the 
event. Any unexpected death or life -threatening suspected adverse drug reaction must be 
reported to FDA no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the 
information . The sponsor shall also inform all investi gators.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Time -Frame for Reporting  
Any death, SAE,  pregnancy  (including pregnancy of a partner) , or unexpected (and severe) AE 
experienced by a subject while receiving or within [ADDRESS_775488] be promptly reported (within 24 hours of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event) by e -mail to the sponsor (or designee).

 [IP_ADDRESS].  Information to be Provided by [CONTACT_588810]  (during study participation) . 
This requirement includes all SAEs that occur after informed consent and through [ADDRESS_775489] be reported to the Kadmon Corporation Pharmacovigilance Department (or designee) . 
The minimum information required for S AE reporting includes identity of investigator, site 
number, subject number, an event description, SAE term(s), onset date, the reason why the event 
is considered to be serious (ie, the seriousness criteria) and the investigator’s assessment of the 
relatio nship of the event to study drug. Additional SAE information including medications or 
other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, action taken with the study drug due to the 
event, and the outcome/resolution of the event will be recorded on the SAE  form . Forms for 
reporting SAE will be provided to the study sites.  
In all cases, the investigator should continue to monitor the clinical situation and report all 
material facts relating to the progression or outcome of the SAE . Furthermore, the investiga tor 
may be required to provide supplementary information as requested by [CONTACT_588811].  
When reporting SAE, the following additional points should be noted:  
• When the diagnosis of an SAE is known or suspected, the investigator should report the 
diagnosis or syndrome as the primary SAE term, rather than as signs or symptoms . Signs 
and symptoms may then be described in the e vent description . For example, d yspnea 
should not be used as an SAE term if the diagnosis which  caused the dyspnea is known to 
be malignant pleural effusion .

 • Death should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE, unless the 
event preceding the death is unknown . In the exceptional case where the events leading to 
death are unk nown, then death may be used as an event term . If an autopsy was performed, 
the autopsy report should be provided.

Kadmon Corporation Drug Safety (or designee) will process and evaluate all SAE s as soon as 
the reports are received . For each SAE  received, Kadmon Corporation will make a determin ation 
as to whether the criteria for expedited reporting have been met.  
Kadmon Corporation (or designee) will submit SAE s that meet the criteria for expedited 
reporting to the Regulatory Authorities in accordance with local regulations governing safety 
reporting . Reporting of SAE s by [CONTACT_135783] /IEC  will be done in 
accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB /IEC . Adequate 
documentation must be maintained showing that the IRB /IEC  was properly notified.

 17. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
All descriptive and inferential statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® (SAS Institute, 
Cary, North Carolina ) statistical software, unless otherwise noted . For categorical variables, the 
number and percent of each category within a parameter will be calculated for non -missing data . 
For continuous variables, the mean, median and standard deviation, as well as the  minimum and 
maximum values, will be presented.  
Statistical significance will be declared when the P value is found to be ≤ 0.05, unless otherwise 
noted . All clinical data captured will be provided in data listings.  
17.1. General Design  
All data for enrolled subjects will be presented in data listings by [CONTACT_18022]. For those 
summary tables in which baseline  and change from baseline  measurements will be presented, the 
last observed measurement prior to the initial dose of KD025 will be considered the baseline  
measurement.   
Continuous data will be described using descriptive statistics: number of observations (n), mean, 
standar d deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Frequencies and percentages will be used 
for summarizing discrete (categorical) data. When categorical data are presented, the percent will 
be suppressed when the count is zero in order to draw attention to the non zero counts. The 
denominator for all percentages, unless otherwise specified, will be the number of subjects in the 
specified analysis population.  Two-sided 95% confidence interval employing the exact binomial 
method will be provided for activity outcomes.  
Hypothesis testing , if appropriate,  will be carried out at the 5% (2 -sided) significance level . 
Because of  the exploratory nature of the study, no adjustments will be made for the multiplicity 
of endpoints . Nonparametric tests may be used in preference to  parametric tests if parametric 
assumptions are notably violated . Missing values will not be imputed . If a subject does not have 
sufficient data for a particular analysis, they will be excluded from that analysis . Endpoints 
defined as an average of multipl e measurements will be used those data points that are 
non-missing, and the denominator was adjusted accordingly.

 17.2. Sample Size Justification  
The total sample size of 16 subjects per KD025 dose group will provide > 90% probability of 
one or more KD025 subje cts experiencing an AE that has an underlying rate of ≥ 14% and 
> 80% probability of one or more subjects in the study experiencing an AE that has an 
underlying rate of ≥ 10%.  
Assuming an underlying 25% rate for subjects to meet the ORR , each treatment gro up of 
16 subjects has an approximately 80% chance of having at least 3  subjects meet the overall 
response criteria, and approximately 90% chance of at least 2  subjects meet the overall response 
criteria.  
17.3. Statistical Considerations  
The statistical methodol ogy will be further described in a Statistical Analysis Plan , which will be 
finalized prior to database lock.  
17.3.1  Study Populations  
Four  populations will be employed in the analysis of study data:  
• The modified intent -to-treat ( mITT) population will consist of  all subjects who are enrolled 
in the study and receive at least 1 dose of study medication .  
• The safety population will consist of all subjects who receive at least one dose of KD025  
• The PK population which will consist of all subjects who receive at lea st one dose of study 
drug and have at least [ADDRESS_775494]  in data listings . In addition, delays and all other alterations in KD0 25 administration will 
be presented.

 17.3.4  Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be coded using WHO -DD and the data will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_588813].  
17.4. Activity  Analysis  
The primary activity  outcome will be the percentage of subjects who meet the OR criteria  (PR + 
CR). This will be assessed overall ( ie, any subject meeting the PR or CR criteria at any time 
point).   For clarity, addition of new systemic therapy for cGVHD will be considered a KD025 
treatment failure and will be considered progression of cGVHD for analysis purposes.  
Secondary Endpoints   
• Number and percentage of KD025 in subjects with steroid -dependent cGVHD who have  a 
best response of PR or CR  
• Change in cGVHD severity as based on the Physician -reported Global cGVHD Activity 
Assessment  
• Change in  symptom acti vity as based on cGVHD Activity Assessment Patient Self -Report  
• Median  FFS will be defined as the time from first dose of study drug to either the start of 
another treatment, relapse of the underlying disease, or death.   
• Changes in corticosteroid and calc ineurin inhibitor dose  
• To evaluate DOR , which will be defined as the time of initial response until documented 
progression.  
• To evaluate response by [CONTACT_34565] . The response by [CONTACT_34565] (PR and CR) will be 
assessed based on the [ADDRESS_775495] on Clinical Trials in 
cGVHD.  
• Analyses of plasma PK of KD025 in subjects with cGVHD  
• OS will be defined as the time from first dose of KD025 to the date of death due to any 
cause. Kaplan -Meier plots, descriptive statistics of OS and landmar k OS at 6, 12, 18 and 24 
months will be  provided . 
• TTNT will be defined as the defined as the time from the first dose of KD025 to the start of 
additional systemic cGVHD therapy Change in symptom burden/bother using the Lee 
cGVHD Symptom Scale .

 Exploratory Endpoints  
• Changes in the expression of several cytokines ( including IL -17A, IL -21, and IL -2) in 
plasma after KD025 administration to subjects with cGVHD  
• Changes in percentage of immune -cell subtypes (including  Th17 and Treg cells)  in whole 
blood after KD0 25 administration to subjects with cGVHD  
17.5. Safety Data  
The primary safety endpoint is the percent of subjects experiencing AEs in Cohort 1 
(200 mg QD), Cohort 2, ( 200 mg BID), and Cohort 3 (400 mg QD).  
Safety assessments include AEs, SAEs, PEs, vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory 
evaluations  (including TSH measurements) , ECGs, PFTs, and reasons for treatment 
discontinuation due to toxicity.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be evaluated using the CTCAE v4.03. The secondary safety 
outcome will be the num ber and percent  of subjects experiencing AEs overall. The total sample 
size of 16 subjects per KD025 dose group will provide >  90% probability of one or more KD025 
subjects experiencing an AE that has an unde rlying rate of ≥  14% and >  80% probability of one 
or more subjects in the study experiencing an AE that has an underlying rate of ≥  10%.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_588814] ( MedDR A®) System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term, classified 
from verbatim terms.  MedDRA® Version  20.[ADDRESS_775496] 1  occurrence of a preferred term will be included. The 
number of events p er preferred term will also be summarized. Causality (relationship to study 
treatment) will be summarized separately.  
All AEs, SAEs, treatment -related AEs, treatment -related SAEs, ≥ Grade 3 AEs, treatment -related 
≥ Grade [ADDRESS_775497] dose of study drug will be summarized. The incidence of ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_775498] the investigator’s records b y the study monitor (source document verification) and

into a computer database and subject to electronic and manual quality assurance procedures.  
VV-CLIN-[ADDRESS_775499] fully adhere to the principles outlined in “Guideline for Good Clinical Practice” 
ICH E6 Tripartite Guideline (January  1997), and in general, be conducted in a manner consistent 
with the most recent version of the Declar ation of Helsinki . The investigator will ensure that the 
conduct of the study complies with the basic principles of GCP as outlined in the current version 
of 21  CFR, subpart  D, Part  312, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators”, Part  50, 
“Protectio n of Human Subjects”, and Part  56, “Institutional Review Boards”.  
19.2. Informed Consent  
Sample ICFs will be supplied to each site . Kadmon  Corporation  or its designee must review any 
ICF prior to submission for review by [CONTACT_1201] /IEC . The final IRB /IEC -approved d ocument must 
be provided to Kadmon Corporation for regulatory purposes.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], to obtain 
written informed consent from each subject (or the subject’s legally authorized repr esentative) 
participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, 
and potential hazards of the study  in accordance with federal and state regulations . In the case 
where the subject is unable to read, an impartia l witness should be present during the entire 
informed consent discussion . After the subject has orally consented to participation in the trial, 
the witness’ signature [CONTACT_588823] d and understood . A copy of the ICF must be provided to the subject or to the 
subject’s legally authorized representative . If applicable, it will be provided in a certified 
translation of the local language.  
The eCRF  for this study contains a section for d ocumenting informed subject consent, and this 
must be completed appropriately . Signed ICFs must remain in each subject’s study file and must 
be available for verification by [CONTACT_9534] . If new safety information results in 
changes in the ri sk/benefit assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and updated as 
necessary . All subjects (including those already being treated) should be informed of the new 
VV-CLIN-[ADDRESS_775500]  
This study is being conducted under a [LOCATION_002] IND application . This protocol (and any 
modifications) and appropriate consent procedures must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_113834]/IEC . This board must o perate in accordance with the current federal or local  regulations . 
The investigator will send a letter or certificate of IRB /IEC  approval to Kadmon Corporation (or 
designee) before subject enrollment and whenever subsequent modifications to the protocol a re 
made.  
19.4. Future Use of Subject Samples  
Not all of the tissue and blood components obtained during this study may be required for the 
tests that are part of the clinical trial . Following the conclusion of the study, the samples may be 
used for additional re search . This research will help to understand disease subtypes, drug 
response and toxicity, and possibly identify new drug targets or biomarkers that predict subject 
response to treatment . The use of the samples for internal research will be done according  to the 
guidelines defined by [CONTACT_486532] (issued 25 April 25 2006) and the 
European Medicines Agency Reflection Paper on Pharmacogenetic Sample s, Testing and Data 
Handling (EMEA/CHMP/PGxWP/201914/2006) . If a subject requests destruction of their tissue 
and blood samples and the samples have not yet been de -identified, Kadmon  Corporation  will 
destroy the samples as described in this FDA guidance . Kadmon Corporatio n will notify the 
investigator in writing that the samples have been destroyed.  
VV-CLIN-[ADDRESS_775501] be submitted to the IRB /IEC  for information and approval in 
accordance with local requirements, and to regulatory agencies if required . Approval must be 
obtained before any changes can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an 
immedi ate hazard to study subjects, or when the change involves only logistical or administrative 
aspects of the trial ( eg, change in monitor, change of telephone number).

Appendix G: Clinical Adverse Events: Determining Relationship to Study Drug  
 
1 NOT RELATED  
This category applies to those AEs, which after careful medical consideration, are clearly 
felt to be due to e xtraneous causes ( eg, disease , environment, etc.) that are unrelated  to 
the administration of study drug.  
 
2 UNLIKELY RELATED  (must  have first 2)  
This category applies to those AEs, which, after careful medical consideration, are felt 
unlikely to be related to the administration of the study drug.  The relationship of an AE 
to the study drug can be considered unlikely  if: 
 
• It does not  follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug.  
• It could readily have been a result of the subject’s clinical state, environmental or to xic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
• It does not follow a known r esponse pattern to the suspected drug.  
• It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re -administered.  
 
3 POSSIBLY RELATED  (must have first 2)  
 
This category applies to those AEs, which, after careful medical consideration, are felt 
unlikely to be related t o the administration of the study drug, but the possibility cannot be 
ruled out with certainty.  The relationship of an AE to the study drug can be considered 
possible  if: 
 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug.  
• It could  readily have been a result of the subject’s clinical state, environmental or to xic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
• It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug.  
 
4 PROBABLY RELATED  (must have first 3)  
 
This categ ory applies to those AEs, which, after careful medical consideration, are felt 
with a high degree of certainty to be related to the administration of the study drug.  The 
relationship of an AE to the study drug can be considered probable  if: 
 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug.  
• It could not be reasonably e xplained by [CONTACT_20612]’s 
clinical state, environmental or to xic factors  or other modes of therapy administered to 
the subject.  
• It disap pears or decreases upon cessation of drug or reduction in dose.*

5 DEFINITELY RELATED  (must have first 3)  
 
This category applies to those AEs, which after careful medical consideration, are felt t o 
be related to the administration of the study drug.  The relationship of an AE to the study 
drug can be considered related  if: 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug or drug 
levels have been established in body fluids o r tissues.  
• It could not be reasonably e xplained by [CONTACT_20612]’s 
clinical state, environmental or to xic factors  or other modes of therapy administered to 
the subject.  
• It disappears or decreases upon cessation of drug or reducti on on dose and appears 
upon rechallenge.*  
• It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug.  
 
 
 
*There are e xceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug relatedness clearly e xists.

1 dose of study medication  
who are not screen failures .   
• The safety population will 
consist of all subjects who 
receive at least one dose of 
KD025  
• The per protocol population will 
consist of subjects who have 
received at least 50% of study 
drug and have at least one 
evaluable response assessment  
• The PK population will consist 
of all subjects who receive at 
least one dose of study drug and 
have at least [ADDRESS_775512] -dose PK

Secondary Endpoints  
• Number and percentage of KD025 in 
subjects with steroid -dependent 
cGVHD who have a best response of 
PR or CR  
• Change in cGVHD severity as based 
on the  Physician -reported global 
cGVHD Activity Assessment  
• Change in symptom activity as based 
on cGVHD Activity Assessment 
Patient Self Report  
• Median FFS will be defined as the 
time from first dose of study drug to 
either the start of another treatment, 
relapse of the underlying disease, or 
death  
• Changes in corticosteroid and 
calcineurin inhibitor dose  
• To evaluate DOR. The DOR is 
defined as the time of initial response 
until documented progression.  
• To evaluate response by [CONTACT_588819]. The response  by [CONTACT_34565] 
(PR and CR) will be assessed based on 
the [ADDRESS_775528] on Clinical Trials in cGVHD.  
• Overall Survival (OS) will be 
defined as the time from first dose of 
KD025 to the date of death due to 
any cause. Kaplan -Meier plots, 
descriptive statistics of OS and 
landmark OS at 6, 12, 18 and 24 
months will be provided  
• Time to Next Treatment  (TTNT) 
will be defined as the defined as the 
time from the first dose of KD025 to 
the start of additional systemic 
cGVHD therapy  
• Change in symptom burden/bother 
using the Lee cGVHD Symptom 
Scale

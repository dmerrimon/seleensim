Background 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death. The lifetime risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_284911] 6%, and almost half of those affected will die of 
the disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_284912], CRC is a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality.  In screening procedures for CRC such as 
sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, and radiography, it is important that the colon be 
thor
oughly purged and cleansed. In particular, it is essential that as much fecal matter 
and fluids as possible be removed from the colon to permit adequate visualization of 
the intestinal mucosa.  
 
 Preliminary Experience with the Similar Bowel Preparations 
 
Two Phase 3 studies were conducted comparing BLI800 (SUPREP) to the FDA 
appr
oved preparation MoviPrep1. The BLI800-301 study evaluated BLI800 as a one-
day preparation, completed on the day prior to colonoscopy. The BLI800-302 study 
uti
lized a two-day (or “split-dose”) regimen in which half the preparation was taken the 
evening prior to colonoscopy, and the remaining half completed on the morning of the 
procedure.

performed in the 302 study, produces markedly superior cleansing results over a one 
day preparation, as in the 301 study. In each study and overall, BLI800 achieved a 
greater number of excellent preparations than MoviPrep. This difference resulted in a 
higher Mean Preparation Score for BLI800, reaching statistical significance (p = 0.049) 
in the total population.

Adverse events were also evaluated in the Phase III studies. The only treatment emergent 
adverse event category with a frequency greater than 3% was gastrointestinal (BLI800 = 
4.5% and MoviPrep = 4.3% ).  The expected symptoms of nausea and vomiting were the 
most frequent (1.3% each) within the gastrointestinal category.  There was no difference 
between BLI800 and MoviPrep in the frequency of any treatment-emergent adverse 
events, including those that were gastrointestinal in origin.  No clinically significant 
differences between groups were seen in laboratory testing of  serum chemistry and 
hematology. At the one month follow-up visit, no change in serum creatinine was 
observed for BLI800 patients. 
 
A smaller Phase III study (n = 136) was conducted comparing the safety and efficacy of 
SUPREP (in the FDA approved split-dose regimen) to NuLYTELY2. In addition to 
preparation success (as defined above), the blinded colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_284913]. As shown below in Tables [ADDRESS_347870] colon segments (most importantly

to adverse events were detected in the elderly population or overall.  The number of 
events expected with gastrointestinal cleansing agents (e.g. nausea, bloating and 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) was insignificant. Differences in laboratory results were considered by 
[CONTACT_284921].  
 
The BL
I800-301 and BLI800-302 studies supported the FDA’s determination that 
SU
PREP was safe and effective in adults undergoing colonoscopy, leading to its FDA  
approval in August 2010.  
 
As a condition of the SUPREP approval, FDA required Braintree Laboratories to 
conduct several post marketing studies in order to further demonstrate the safety of 
SUPREP in special populations (the elderly, and those with renal or hepatic 
impairment) and to look for rare occurring serious adverse events. In study BLI800-
440 (PMR 1580-7), patients in special populations (renal/hepatic/elderly) took 
SU
PREP prior to colonoscopy and were followed for 6 months. 184 patients took 
SUPREP in this study, which also included non-special population patients (e.g. 
pati
ents undergoing screening colonoscopy). SUPREP was shown to be safe in all of 
thes
e patient groups in near term and long term follow up, comparable to the 
GoLY
TELY comparator used in the study.  
 
Studies BLI800-430 and BLI800-431 (PMR 1580-8) evaluated the safety of SUPREP 
in special populations (renal/hepatic/elderly) through repeated ECG measurements. A 
total of 37 patients completed the study and no significant ECG changes were seen 
after patients took two SUPREP doses 2 hours apart (acute administration).  
 
For study BLI800-450 (PMR 1580-6), a large retrospective review of electronic 
m
edical records and insurance claims was conducted to tabulate the rates of specific 
serious adverse events (e.g. cardiac events, rental failure, ischemic colitis) occurring 
within [ADDRESS_347872] up to 37  days. A screening visit (Visit 1) 
shoul
d be performed within 30 days of the colonoscopy. Subjects meeting all eligibility 
criteria wi
ll be enrolled to receive BLI4700.  Subjects will return to the clinic the day of

4.3.2.  Drug Accountability 
Subjects will be instructed to bring the used preparation components when they return for 
colonoscopy to determine compliance. Failure of a subject to return preparation 
components does not constitute a protocol violation. The staff members will perform drug 
accou
ntability by [CONTACT_284924]4700 tablets.  
Returned study preparation materials must be accounted for on drug inventory log and will 
be returned to the Sponsor at the completion or termination of the study, unless instructed 
otherwise by [CONTACT_1034]. 
4.4. Follow up of Adverse Events and Laboratory Results

4Subjects with ongoing preparation-related AEs/clinically significant lab results may need to return on follow up Day [ADDRESS_347883] will rate each colon segment (proximal, mid, 
dist
al) using the following scale: 
Score  Grade  Description  
1 Poor  Large amounts of fecal residue, additional 
bowel preparation required  
2 Fair Enough feces even after washing and suctioning 
to prevent clear visualization of the e ntire 
colonic mucosa.  
3 Good  Feces and fluid requiring washing and 
suctioning, but still achieves clear visualization 
of the entire colonic mucosa.  
4 Excellent  No more than small bits of feces/fluid which 
can be suctioned easily; achieves clear 
visualiza tion of the entire colonic mucosa  
4.6.[ADDRESS_347884] will provide a global 
rating of preparation quality for the entire colon (inclusive of their perception of all 
segments) using the scale outlined in Section 4.6.1.   
4.6.3 Additional Efficacy Measures 
In addition, the following data will be collected: 
1. Adequacy of preparation according to the colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. If the
preparation was not adequate, the need for re-preparation will be
recorded.
2.Start time of colonoscopy.
3. Time of cecal intubation.
4. Completion time of colonoscopy.
5. Volume of water used to improve visualization.

ADVERSE EVENTS
5.1. Ad verse Event Definition and Reporting 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use 
of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal 
labor
atory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product.  Subjects will be queried for any problems they 
experienced during and after preparation by [CONTACT_8786]. Symptoms on the 
sym
ptom scale rated as 2 (mild) to 5 (severely distressing) must be reported as an 
adverse event. Colonoscopy and biopsy findings are not considered adverse events 
unless considered by [CONTACT_284925].  
Adverse event collection will commence at the time the patient provides informed 
consent. Subjects that have an ongoing treatment emergent adverse event or 
clinically significant abnormal laboratory value will be followed up approximately 
one week aft
er colonoscopy.  
Subjects will be instructed to promptly report adverse events to the Investigator. The 
Investigator will record date/time of report, date/time of onset, description of the 
adverse event, severity of adverse event, action(s) taken regarding treatment of the 
event, action(s) taken regarding study participation, duration of adverse event, and 
the Investigator's assessment of relationship of adverse event to study preparation.  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc. Confidential 
Protocol Number BLI4700- 202 
Version dated 16 FEB 2017  Page 23 of 33 The Inves
tigator should assess the severity of each adverse event using the following 
categories: 
Grade  Severity  Description 
1 Mild  Barely noticeable, does not influence functioning  
causing no limitations of usual activities  
2 Moderate  Makes participant uncomfortable, influences functioning  
causing some limitat ions of usual activities  
3 Severe  Severe discomfort, treatment needed  
Severe and undesirable, causing inability to carry out usual  
Activities  
4 Life 
threatening  Immediate risk of death , Life threatening or disabling  
(Must be reported as serious adverse e vent) 
5 Fatal  Causes death of the participant  
(Must be reported as serious adverse event)  
The Investigator should assess the relationship to study drug for each adverse event 
using
 the following categories: 
Categories of 
Attribution:  Description  
UNR ELATED  There is no evidence of any causal relationship.  
POSSIBLE  There is some  evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of 
the trial medication). However, the influence of other fact ors 
may have contributed  to the event (e.g., the subject ’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events).  
PROBABLE  There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely . 
DEFINITE  There is clear  evidence to sug gest a causal relationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out .

Expected Adverse Events 
Because BLI4700 tablets contain the same active ingredient (sodium sulfate) as 
SUPREP, a similar adverse event profile is expected. In Phas e [ADDRESS_347887] frequent adverse events reported by [CONTACT_284926] (reported by >3% 
of patie
nts) included overall discomfort, abdominal pain and distension, nausea, and 
vomiting.  
6. SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTIONS AND DISCONTINUATION OF
STUDY
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that results in 
at least one of the following outcomes: 
- Results in death
- Is life-threatening
-
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
- A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to
conduct normal life functions
- Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
- Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment
or damage
SAE collection will coincide with the patient beginning the study preparation 
and will conclude 30 days after colonoscopy.  Pre-scheduled or elective surgeries will 
not be
 considered serious adverse events. Should a serious and/or unexpected adverse 
event occur, the Investigator will notify Braintree Laboratories immediately or no later 
than [ADDRESS_347888] with oversight of the study.  
Any serious and/or unexpected adverse events that occur during the study 
will be reported to Braintree Laboratories as follows: 
Contact [CONTACT_284598]:  
During Business hours 
(M-F, 8:30 am – 5:00 pm EDT) 
Af
ter hours or weekends 
Braintree Laboratories and its medical monitor will review the report and determine 
whether an FDA Form 3500A will also be completed and sent to FDA. 
7. INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) AND INFORMED
CONSENT
IRB review and approval of the study protocol and Informed Consent Form will be 
obtained prior to initiation of the study.  Amendments to the study protocol and consent 
form generated during the course of the study will also require IRB approval. 
8. MANAGEMENT OF INTERCURRENT EVENTS
8.1. Modification of Protocol 
Investigators may request an exemption from Braintree Laboratories to enroll a 
subject with questionable eligibility or to continue a subject with a protocol 
violation. Note that eligibility criteria exemptions may require pre-approval from the 
Institutional Review Board. Investigators that continually violate the protocol or 
commit a serious violation may be subject to termination from the study. The study 
may be halted if at any time an Investigator or Braintree Laboratories deems the 
incidence or severity of adverse events to be unacceptable.

8.2. Sub jects Discontinued fro m the Study 
Subjects may be dropped f rom the study for any of the following reasons: 
 An adverse event requiring discontinuation (including failure to tolerate study 
medication). 
 Female participants who become pregnant during the study period. 
 Major protocol deviation from the study design by [CONTACT_8789] 
 Subject chooses to withdraw from the study, for whatever reason. 
 Subject is lost to follow-up. 
 The Sponsor i
nitiates an early discontinuation of the study. 
 The subject is withdrawn at the discretion of the Investigator.

9. DA TA ANALYSIS 
9.1. Study Endpoints - Efficacy 
Prim
ary efficacy will be assessed on the basis of a binary outcome of overall 
pre
paration success or failure. The following definition of preparation success and 
failur
e will be used: 
 
Definition of successful preparation :  
1. Overall Cleansing Assessment by [CONTACT_8779][INVESTIGATOR_541] (Section 4.6.2) of 
“
Excellent” or “Good” and does not satisfy any of the following failure criteria.    
 
Def
inition of failed preparation :  
1. Overal l Cleansing Assessment of “Fair” or “Poor” by [CONTACT_8779][INVESTIGATOR_541]. 
2. Any subject who did not have a colonoscopy based on the Investigator’s 
assessment of the cleansing (insufficient fecal output, unclear fecal 
discharge, etc.) or due to preparation related adverse events. 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential 
Protocol Number BLI4700- [ADDRESS_347889]  for whom cleaning was not adequate for evaluation. 
 
 
Inevaluable Patients: 
Subjects who were dispensed a kit but withdrew from the study prior to taking any 
preparation (including subjects who were disqualified subsequent to Visit 1 based on 
screening laboratory results) are excluded from the efficacy and safety analyses. Any 
subject who completely or partially took study preparation but did not have a 
colonoscopy due to non-preparation related reasons will not be included in the 
efficacy analyses. All treated subjects will be included in the safety analysis. 
 
Additional efficacy endpoints will include: 
 Number (%) of excellent preparations overall and by [CONTACT_8791] 
 Adequacy of cleani ng and need for re-preparation  
 Durat ion of colonoscopy 
 Volu me of intraprocedural water needed to irrigate the colon  
 Num ber (%) of procedures that reached the cecum 
 Tim e to cecum 
 
9.2. Study E ndpoints - Safety 
Adverse Events:  
All subjects who took preparation in any amount will be included in the safety 
anal
ysis. All adverse events will be summarized based on the principle of treatment 
em
ergence. A sign or symptom will be regarded as treatment-emergent if it was 
present prior to the first dose and subsequently worsened in severity, or was not 
present prior to the first dose but subsequently appeared. 
 
In order to define treatment emergence for events with missing start or stop dates the 
following additional criteria will be used: 
 if both t he onset and resolution dates for a particular event are missing, then 
the event is considered treatment-emergent; 
 if the onset date for an event is missing and the resolution date falls after the 
ini
tiation of the first dose, then the event is considered treatment-emergent; 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential 
Protocol Number BLI4700- 202 
Version dated 16 FEB 2017   Page 28 of 33  if the onset date for an event falls after the initiation of the first dose and the 
res
olution date is missing or  present, then the event is considered treatment-
em
ergent; and 
 if the ons et date for an event falls before the initiation of the first dose and the 
stop d
ate is missing or  present, then the event is not considered treatment-
em
ergent. 
 
Adverse events will be collected using MedDRA category designations for body 
system and preferred term. The number and percent of subjects who experienced 
each 
adverse event will be presented in a tabular form.   
 
Vitals Signs and Physical Examination: 
Vital signs and physical examination data will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics. 
 
Laboratory Data: 
Results of laboratory tests for the change from baseline (Screening) will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics. 
 
Symptom Questionnaire Data: 
Symptom questionnaire data for individual symptoms for Overall Experience 
(Stomach Crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Stomach Bloating and Nausea) will be presented. 
 
9.3. Sample  Size

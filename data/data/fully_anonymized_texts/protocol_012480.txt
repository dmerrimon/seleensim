.
Other evaluations are Investigator Ease of Use Assessment, Swelling Assessment, and Subject 
Satisfaction with Lips Assessment. 
PRO 2018-[ADDRESS_221179] is considered to be enrolled in the study when he/she has provided written informed 
consent. 
A subject is considered to have completed the study after he/she has completed the Month [ADDRESS_221180] withdrawn after he/she has withdrawn consent or has been 
withdrawn under the conditions specified in Section 7.3.[ADDRESS_221181] to follow-up if he/she cannot be contact[CONTACT_24992]. The investigator will document efforts to attempt to reach the subject at least twice 
by [CONTACT_94598] a certified letter before considering the subject lost to follow-up. The 
end of participation for a subject lost to follow-up is documented as the date of the certified 
letter. 
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including serious adverse events 
(SAEs), starting immediately after treatment initiation. Each subject will be followed for safety 
monitoring until he/she is discharged from the study. 
Follow-up procedures related to pregnancy, AEs, or SAEs may continue beyond the end of the 
study. 
Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 6 months from the time he/she signs 
the ICF through the final contact. After determination of eligibility at Visit 1/Day 1, each subject 
will be treated with study device. 
It is anticipated that the duration of this study will be 20 months from the beginning to the end of 
the study (first subject signing the ICF to last contact [CONTACT_110169]). 
7.[ADDRESS_221182] meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for the study: 
1. In Protocol PRO 2018-02, the subject was in the per-protocol population, i.e., met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria; received study device, completed Visit 5 within the specified 
window; had LFGS score by [CONTACT_187386] 3/Month 2, and 
had no significant protocol violations that would affect the treatment evaluation. 
2. If female and of childbearing potential, a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 1/Day [ADDRESS_221183] agrees to use adequate contraception during the study period
3. Willing to give written informed consent 
7.3.2 Exclusion Criteria 
Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:  
1.  Women who are pregnant, lactating, or planning a pregnancy 
 
PRO 2018-[ADDRESS_221184] will be withdrawn from the study if his/her safety or well-being is determined to be at 
risk. Withdrawal will be made at the discretion of the investigator or at the subject’s request. 
A subject must withdraw from the study for any of the following reasons: 
 The subject or legal representative withdraws consent
 There is a significant protocol violation as determined by [CONTACT_187387]. 
A subject may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:
 Lost to follow-up 
 Investigator discretion 
Withdrawal is permanent; after a subject has been withdrawn, he/she will not be allowed to 
enroll again. 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study for any reason, the EOS or Early Termination 
procedures (Visit 3/Month 2) should be completed and any outstanding data and study device 
should be collected. Data, including the date and primary reason for withdrawal, must be 
documented on the EOS case report form (CRF) and source document. 
If a subject withdraws from the study at any time due to an AE, the reason for withdrawal, the 
nature of the AE, and its clinical course must be fully documented. The investigator must strive 
to follow the subject until the AE has resolved, become clinically insignificant, is stabilized, or 
the subject is lost to follow-up. For any SAE, follow procedures provided in Section 7.9.[ADDRESS_221185] who withdraws from the study will not be replaced.  
7.4 Treatments 
The investigator will take responsibility for and will take all steps to maintain appropriate
records and ensure appropriate supply, handling, storage, distribution, and use of study materials 
in accordance with the protocol and any applicable laws and regulations.
7.4.1 Dosage and Formulations 
PN40082 (manufactured by [CONTACT_187388]) is a clear, colorless gel in 1.0 mL 
pre-filled syringes with 25 mg/mL of stabilized hyaluronic acid and lidocaine 0.3% w/w. The 
study device will be provided by [CONTACT_1034]. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_221186] should be positioned in a seated position and may be reclined to as much as 45°. 
PRO 2018-[ADDRESS_221187] 
(such as Neutrogena Cleansing Makeup Remover Facial Wipes).
The non-vermillion areas of the upper and lower lips should be prepared by [CONTACT_187389] 
a surgical scrub product (Chlorhexidine, Technicare, etc.). 
To prepare the syringes for use, the investigator should attach one of the needles included in the 
subject study device kit in a firm manner. The plunger should be gently depressed to express any 
unwanted air until a small droplet of implant material appears at the tip of the needle.  
Study device is administered using only a needle provided in the subject study device kit. The 
needle is inserted at an approximate angle of 30° parallel to the surface of the skin or lip. For 
rhytids, study device  should be injected into the mid-to-deep dermis. Study device  should be 
injected into the submucosal layer for lip augmentation; care should be taken to avoid 
intramuscular injection. If study device  is injected too superficially this may result in visible 
lumps and/or bluish discoloration. 
Inject study device  applying light to moderate, even pressure on the plunger. Avoid injecting 
quickly as rapid injection can result in increased pain. It is important that the injection is stopped 
just before the needle is pulled out of the skin to prevent material from leaking out or being too 
superficially implanted into the skin. 
Only correct or augment to 100% of the desired volume effect. Do not overcorrect or overfill.  
The needle may be replaced as needed to ensure subject comfort. Only needles provided in the 
subject study device kit may be used. Before needle replacement, the plunger should be 
withdrawn slightly and once the needle has been replaced, the plunger re-advanced to ensure that 
the new needle is prefilled with implant material prior to restarting injections. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_187371]. Based on U.S. clinical studies, the maximum volume 
allowed per treatment is 1.5 mL per lip (1.5 for upper, 1.5 for lower) and 1.0 mL for perioral 
rhytid correction. Thus, the maximum amount that can be used at one treatment session is 4.0 ml. 
Amounts of material injected should be recorded separately for the upper lip, lower lip and 
perioral areas. 
INJECTION TECHNIQUES 
1. Study device  can be injected by a number of different techniques that depend on the 
treating investigator’s experience and preference and subject characteristics. 
2. Serial puncture involves multiple, closely spaced injections along wrinkles, folds, or 
the vermillion border. Although serial puncture allows precise placement of the filler, it 
produces multiple puncture wounds that may be undesirable to some subjects.
3. Linear threading (includes retrograde and antegrade) is accomplished by [CONTACT_187390] a “thread.” Although threading is most commonly practiced 
after the needle has been fully inserted and is being withdrawn, it can also be performed 
while advancing the needle - antegrade technique). To augment the lip, the retrograde 
linear threading technique is the most advisable. 
4. Serial threading is a technique that utilizes elements of both approaches.
PRO 2018-03 Confidential  Version 2.0 
Protocol  13NOV2018 
14Note! The correct injection technique is crucial for the final result of the treatment. 
5. The following techniques should be avoided as they may result in an increase in short-
term epi[INVESTIGATOR_187372], swelling, redness, pain, or tenderness at the injection site:
• Dissection of the sub-epi[INVESTIGATOR_187373] –
“fanning” 
• Rapid flow rate (> 0.3 mL/min) of implant material injection 
• High injection volumes  
• The use of needles other than ones provided in the subject study device kit
6. The use of cannulas is prohibited. 
7. When the injection is completed, the treated site should be gently  massaged so that it 
conforms to the contour of the surrounding tissues. Massaging that substantially deforms 
the lips or causes blanching of compressed tissues is excessive and should be avoided 
except as described below. 
8.  If excessive material is implanted or irregularly implanted, massage the area somewhat 
more firmly than for the usual implantation procedure to obtain optimal results.
9. If blanching of the tissues is observed during or directly after injection and becomes a 
concern, the area may be gently massaged. If blanching persists, contact [CONTACT_22955].
10. The lips should be augmented to achieve the maximum desirable appearance for both the 
treating investigator and the subject. Subjects should be provided a small hand mirror to 
observe the results and further injections conducted until maximum benefit has been 
obtained. Care should be taken to ensure that the lips are symmetric from right to left 
and that the upper and lower lips have relative proportionality. 
11. The perioral area should be corrected AFTER the upper and lower lips have been 
corrected. Some correction of perioral rhytids may occur with lip augmentation, thus it is 
best to address any remaining perioral correction needs after the lip injections have been 
completed.   
12. If the treated area is swollen directly after the injection, an ice pack can be applied on the 
site for a short period if the investigator deems it appropriate. Ice should be used with 
caution if the area is still numb from anesthetic to avoid thermal injury. 
13. Subjects should be encouraged to avoid a recumbent position for several hours after 
injections to reduce swelling. The use of ice, cold packs or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_187374]. The subject should 
be instructed to contact [CONTACT_187391]. 
7.4.3 Method of Packaging, Labeling, Storage, and Dispensing 
For PN40082, one 1.0 mL syringe is packaged along with two fine-gauge needles (30G) in an 
easy-open tray. Each syringe is equipped with a Luer-Lok as well as a custom finger grip and 
plunger rod. The syringes contain a peelable label to be placed on the subject record for tracking 
purposes. Two trays are packaged in a carton. A label that includes the protocol number and

are considered acceptable methods of birth control for the purpose of this study: oral 
contraceptives, contraceptive patches, contraceptive implant, vaginal contraceptive, double 
barrier methods (e.g., condom and spermicide), contraceptive injection (Depo-Provera®), IUD, 
hormonal IUD (Mirena®), and abstinence with a documented second acceptable method of birth 
control if the subject becomes sexually active. Subjects entering the study who are on hormonal 
contraceptives must have been on the method for at least [ADDRESS_221197] stopped no less than 90 days prior to Visit 1/Day 1. 
7.6.8 Lip Fullness Grading Scale  
The LFGS is a validated 5-point photonumeric rating scale that was developed to objectively 
quantify the 3-dimensional fullness of the lip. The scale ratings are 0 for very thin, 1 for thin, 
2 for moderately thick, 3 for thick, and 4 for full (Carruthers et al, 2008). Photographs illustrating 
the ratings will be provided to each site. The assessments of overall lip fullness considering both 
lips together, fullness of the upper lip, and fullness of the lower lip will be performed at each 
study visit.

7.9 Assessment of Safety
7.9.1 Safety Endpoints
Safety of the retreatment with PN40082 will be evaluated by [CONTACT_47972], severity, and frequency 
of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). All AEs that occur during the study will be 
recorded whether or not they are considered to be related to treatment. A description of the AE 
will be recorded with the date of onset, date of resolution, severity of the AE, relationship to the 
study device, action taken, and the outcome.
7.9.[ADDRESS_221207], including any changes in vision and any events attributable to 
an embolic or ischemic cause (e.g., skin infarction), will be evaluated. Other safety evaluations 
are lip function, lip sensation, lip texture, lip firmness, lip symmetry, and lip movement/function. 
.
7.9.3 Definitions of Terms 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug/device
in humans, whether or not considered drug/device-related (21 Code of Federal Regulations 
[CFR] 312.32 (a) and 803). An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a drug/device, without any judgment about causality.
Expected adverse events are defined as the events that appeared at injection site subsequent to 
the first injection. Expected adverse events may include but are not limited to bruising, swelling, 
erythema, edema, and inflammation at injection site. 
PRO 2018-03 Confidential  Version 2.0 
Protocol  13NOV2018 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Suspected Adverse Reaction
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is defined as any AE for which there is reasonable 
possibility that the drug/device caused the AE (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unexpected Adverse Event
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if it is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the labeling for the study device.
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Certain events will require more detailed and timely reporting. These include: 
- any changes in vision 
- any events attributable to an embolic or ischemic cause (e.g., skin infarction)
- Any incidence of an event due to an embolic or ischemic cause or visual disturbances 
(including, but not limited to, any loss of vision, blurry vision, double vision, pain in or 
around eye, blind spot or shadow in the visual field, trouble moving eyes, etc.) MUST be 
immediately reported to the Medical Monitor by [CONTACT_648], email or fax. The 
investigator/coordinator must complete the AE source/CRF page and email or fax it to 
the Medical monitor as soon as possible after the investigator or coordinator has become 
aware of its occurrence. These reports will include the depth of injection, the injection 
volume, the symptoms that were observed, the time to onset, time to resolution, and any 
interventions that were implemented. The Sponsor will notify the FDA within 
[ADDRESS_221208]. 
Refer to Appendix 1: Filler First Aid Protocol .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is defined as any AE or SAR that, in the view of the investigator or Sponsor, results in 
any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32 (a)): 
 Death 
 Life-threatening AE (Note: the term “life-threatening” as used here refers to an event that 
in the view of the investigator or Sponsor places the subject at immediate risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not include an AE or SAE that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death [21 CFR 312.32(a)]) 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. See exclusion to SAE 
reporting below under Planned Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage
PRO 2018-03 Confidential  Version 2.0 
Protocol  13NOV2018 
27 Any “other” important medical event. Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Planned Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110156] a therapeutic 
intervention and not the result of a new SAE and should be recorded as medical history. If the 
planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187379], the record in the subject’s medical 
history is considered complete. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it must 
be reported as an AE. 
7.9.[ADDRESS_221209] a follow-up Pregnancy Report with any relevant 
information to the Sponsor or designee.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator will 
report the event by [CONTACT_29658] a completed SAE report form to the Sponsor or designee within 
[ADDRESS_221210] will be followed for safety monitoring until discharged from 
the study. Follow-up procedures related to pregnancy or AEs or SAEs may continue beyond the 
end of the study. 
Subjects will be questioned and/or examined by [CONTACT_1720] a qualified designee for 
occurrence of AEs throughout the study. The presence or absence of specific AEs should not be 
elicited from subjects. In addition, subjects will be instructed to record AEs on the subject diary 
card during the [ADDRESS_221211]’s source documentation. 
PRO 2018-[ADDRESS_221212] to be withdrawn from the study and SAEs, relevant clinical 
assessments will be repeated as clinically appropriate until final resolution or stabilization of the 
event(s). 
7.9.6 Assessment of Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity
Severity of AEs will be graded according to the following definitions: 
Mild: AE that was easily tolerated
Moderate: AE sufficiently discomforting to interfere with daily activity
Severe: AE that prevented normal daily activities 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality 
A medically qualified investigator must assess the relationship of any AE (including SAEs) to 
the use of the study device as unlikely related, possibly related, or probably related based on 
available information, using the following guidelines:
Unlikely related: no temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified, or 
the study device cannot be implicated based on available information 
Possibly related: temporal association but other etiologies are likely to be the cause; 
however, involvement of the study device cannot be excluded based on available 
information 
Probably related: temporal association, other etiologies are possible, but unlikely based 
on available information

7.9.9 Criteria for Early Termination of the Study 
The trial may be terminated because of safety concerns. If termination is deemed appropriate, 
there will be timely communication with the FDA in accordance with the regulations (21 CFR 
812.150 (devices)). The sponsor, Prollenium Medical Technologies, will initiate discussion as 
soon as possible about the appropriate course of action for the trial in question and for the 
investigational product. There will be immediate follow-up by [CONTACT_187399]. 
In the event of a vascular embolic event leading to skin necrosis, vision loss, or stroke, 
enrollment and treatment at the investigational site will be suspended and a root cause 
investigation will be conducted to determine the cause of the embolic event and whether the 
outcome was anticipated (the investigator did not properly follow the treatment SOP) or 
unanticipated (the investigator did properly follow the treatment SOP). If the latter situation is 
observed, the entire study will be immediately suspended and no subjects will be enrolled until 
the event can be properly characterized and an appropriate treatment strategy to avoid this 
unanticipated event can be devised.

10.2.1  Case Report Forms (CRFs)
CRFs for individual subjects will be provided by [CONTACT_16015]. CRFs must be legible 
and complete. CRFs for this study will be maintained in a study binder and data recorded on 
2-part NCR paper. One copy will be kept by [CONTACT_187407]. All forms should be completed using a black ballpoint pen. Errors should 
be lined out, but not obliterated,  and the correction inserted, initialed, and dated by [CONTACT_51988]. Further data corrections will be performed on special “data correction forms” 
(DCFs) that will be provided to the investigator in case of erroneous or unclear data. The 
investigator will make the correction on the DCF and sign the DCF. The original will be sent to 
the study monitor and a copy retained with the CRFs. 
A CRF must be completed and signed by [CONTACT_187408], including 
those withdrawn from the study for any reason. The reason for withdrawal must be noted on a 
subject’s study termination form. 
CRFs must be kept current to reflect the subject’s status at each phase during the course of the 
study. Subjects are not to be identified on CRFs by [CONTACT_2300]; appropriately coded identification and 
the subject’s initials must be used. The investigator must keep a separate log of the subjects’ 
names and addresses. 
Source documents such as the clinic chart are to be maintained separately from the CRF to allow 
data verification. Because of the potential for errors, inaccuracies, and illegibility in transcribing 
data onto CRFs, originals of laboratory and other test results must be kept on file with the 
subject’s CRF. CRFs, source documents, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_110161]. The following should also be available for review:  Subject Screening Log, which should reflect the reason any subject screened for the study

AEs 
An original, signed ICF for study participation
The investigator must also retain all subject-specific printouts/reports of tests and procedures 
performed as a requirement of the study. During monitoring visits the monitor will validate CRF 
entries against these data sources. 
10.3 Study Monitoring 
The Sponsor or designee will be responsible for monitoring the study according to GCP and 
applicable regulations. The study will be monitored by a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) in 
compliance with GCP, ICH guidelines, and applicable regulations. The investigator will be 
visited by a CRA prior to the study and at regular intervals during the course of the study. These 
visits are to verify adherence to the protocol. The CRA will review the ICFs and verify CRF 
entries by [CONTACT_94614] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic/office records) that will be 
made available for this purpose. The CRA will review the maintenance of regulatory 
documentation and product accountability. The monitor will review the progress of the study 
with the investigator and other site personnel on a regular basis. CRFs may be collected during 
these visits. At the end of the study, a closeout monitoring visit will be performed. Monitoring 
visits will be arranged with site personnel in advance at a mutually acceptable time. Sufficient 
time must be allowed by [CONTACT_187411]. The coordinator and/or investigator should be available to answer questions or 
resolve data clarifications. Adequate time and space for these visits should be made available by

3510.4 Audits and Inspections 
During the course of the study and/or after it has been completed, 1 or more sites may be audited 
by [CONTACT_187412]. The purpose of the audit is to determine whether or 
not the study is being conducted and monitored in compliance with recognized GCP/ICH 
guidelines and regulations. 
Additionally, the study may be inspected by [CONTACT_12721]. These inspections may take 
place at any time during or after completion of the study and are based on local regulations.
10.5 Modifications to the Protocol
The procedures defined in the protocol and CRFs will be carefully reviewed to ensure that all 
parties involved with the study fully understand the protocol. To ensure the validity of the data, 
no deviations from the protocol (with minimal exceptions) may be made unless the issue is broad 
enough to warrant revision of the protocol. Such revisions must be submitted to and have 
documented approval from the Sponsor and IRB prior to implementation. The only circumstance 
in which an amendment may be initiated without prior IRB approval is to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to a subject or subjects. In such a case, however, the investigator must notify 
the Sponsor immediately and the IRB within [ADDRESS_221229] CRFs and all other relevant data and records to the 
Sponsor or designee. The investigator will complete and report (submission of CRFs) his/her 
study in satisfactory compliance with the protocol as soon as possible after the completion of the 
study. 
The investigator must submit a final report to the IRB and the Sponsor within 1 month of study 
completion or early termination.

4015 APPENDIX 2: PN40082 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
PN40082 Injectable Hyaluronic Acid Gel with 0.3% Lidocaine 
 
Caution: Federal Law restricts this device to investigational use. This device is limited by 
[CONTACT_4496] (or [LOCATION_002]) law to investigational use 
DESCRIPTION 
PN40082 is a gel of hyaluronic acid generated by [CONTACT_187417], chemically 
crosslinked with BDDE, stabilized and suspended in phosphate buffered saline at pH=7 with 
0.3% lidocaine. 
INDICATION 
PN40082 is indicated for submucosal implantation for lip augmentation and dermal implantation 
for correction of perioral rhytids in patients over the age of 21. 
CONTRAINDICATIONS  PN40082 is contraindicated for patients with severe allergies manifested by a history of 
anaphylaxis or history or presence of multiple severe allergies. 
 PN40082 contains trace amounts of gram positive bacterial proteins and is 
contraindicated for patients with a history of allergies to such material. 
 PN40082 is contraindicated for patients with bleeding disorders. 
 PN40082 is contraindicated for implantation in anatomical spaces other than the dermis 
or submucosal implantation for lip augmentation. 
 PN40082 should not be used in patients with previous hypersensitivity to local 
anesthetics of the amide type, such as lidocaine. 
WARNINGS 
 Defer use of PN40082 at specific sites in which an active inflammatory process (skin 
eruptions such as cysts, pi[INVESTIGATOR_59423], rashes, or hives) or infection is present until the process 
has been controlled. 
 Injection site reactions (e.g., lip swelling, lip pain, and contusion) to PN40082, including 
short-term minor or moderate inflammatory symptoms starting shortly after treatment of 
lips    
 PN40082 must not be implanted into blood vessels. Localized superficial necrosis and 
scarring may occur after injection in or near vessels, such as in the lips, nose, or glabellar 
area. It is thought to result from the injury, obstruction, or compromise of blood vessels.
 Delayed onset inflammatory papules have been reported following the use of dermal 
fillers. Inflammatory papules that may occur rarely should be considered and treated as a 
soft tissue infection. 
PRO 2018-03 Confidential  Version 2.0

41 Injections of 4.0 mL or greater (upper and lower lip combined) per treatment session 
increases the occurrence of injection site reactions. If a volume of more than [ADDRESS_221237] until any initial swelling and redness has 
resolved. 
 If laser treatment, chemical peeling or any other procedure based on active dermal 
response is considered after treatment with PN40082 , there is a possible risk of eliciting 
an inflammatory reaction at the implant site. This also applies if PN40082 is administered 
before the skin has healed completely after such a procedure.

Protocol  13NOV2018 
42 Injection of PN40082 into patients with a history of previous herpetic eruption may be 
associated with reactivation of the herpes. 
HOW SUPPLIED 
PN40082 is supplied in a disposable glass syringe with a Luer-Lok® fitting. PN40082 is packed 
with two 1.0 mL syringes and two sterilized needle(s) 30 G x ½” in a peel tray contained in a 
carton. A patient record label is a part of the syringe label. This label is to be attached to patient 
records to ensure traceability of the product. The contents of the syringe are sterile.
SHELF LIFE AND STORAGE
PN40082 must be used prior to the expi[INVESTIGATOR_187383]. Store at a temperature 
of 5 to 25° C (77° F). Do not freeze. Protect from sunlight.  
Do not use if the package is damaged.  
INJECTION TECHNIQUES 
1. Study device can be injected by a number of different techniques that depend on the 
treating investigator’s experience and preference, and patient characteristics. 
2. Serial puncture  involves multiple, closely spaced injections along wrinkles, folds or the 
vermillion border. Although serial puncture allows precise placement of the filler, it 
produces multiple puncture wounds that may be undesirable to some patients. 
3. Linear threading (includes retrograde and antegrade)  is accomplished by [CONTACT_187390] a “thread.” Although threading is most commonly practiced 
after the needle has been fully inserted and is being withdrawn, it can also be performed 
while advancing the needle - antegrade technique). To enhance the lip, the retrograde 
linear threading technique is the most advisable. 
4. Serial threading is a technique that utilizes elements of both approaches.   
 Note! The correct injection technique is crucial for the final result of the treatment. 
5. The following techniques should be avoided as they may result in an increase in short-
term epi[INVESTIGATOR_187372], swelling, redness, pain, or tenderness at the injection site: 
 Dissection of the sub-epi[INVESTIGATOR_187373] –
“fanning” 
 Rapid flow rate (>0.3 mL/min) of implant material injection 
 High injection volumes  
 The use of needles other than those provided in the treatment kit 
6. The use of cannulas is prohibited 
7. When the injection is completed, the treated site should be gently  massaged so that it 
conforms to the contour of the surrounding tissues.  Massaging that substantially deforms 
the lips, or causes blanching of compressed tissues, is excessive, and should be avoided 
except as described below.

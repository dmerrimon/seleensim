4. Abstract 
Title : Study of Iodinated contrast agents and risk of hypothyroidism in young children in the 
[LOCATION_002] 
 
Rationale and background:   While it is generally known and acknowledged that exposure to 
iodi
ne contrast can interfere with thyroid function, little is known about the incidence of iodine-
induced hypothyroidism in young children (under age 4).  
Research question and objectives:  The goal of this study is to estimate the incidence rate of 
de
tected hypothyroidism in a US-based general population of patients less than [ADDRESS_1149907] agent.  
Stud
y design: This will be a retrospective cohort study.  
Population: Patients less than age 4 in the US-based Kaiser Permanente Northern Cali fornia  
data during years 2008 through 2015 
Var
iables:  Age, sex, calendar year, diagnostic procedure, comorbidities, treatments  
Dat
a sources:  Kaiser Permanente Northern [LOCATION_004]  database 
Study size: There are  millions patients under age [ADDRESS_1149908] agent.  
Data analysis: We will estimate incidence rates of hypothyroidism in the [ADDRESS_1149909] 
exposure and hypothyroidism 
Milestones:  A preliminary report will be provided by [CONTACT_466] 2016 and a final report by 31

Final report of study results  [ADDRESS_1149910] agent with an 
iodine concentration of 300 mg iodine/ml contains [ADDRESS_1149911].1,2 Since it is known that thyroid hormones 
a
re essential for the development of newborn and infants, hypothyroidism may pose a serious 
threat to a child's physical and mental development if left untreated. Hypothyroidism can affect 
both newborns and older children and can lead to delayed growth, overweight, enlargement of 
the th
yroid gland, among other symptoms. In very young children prolonged hypothyroidism can 
lead to development delay. 3,[ADDRESS_1149912] media on thyroid function of neonates. Overall 8.3% of the 
term infants and 18.3% of the premature infants developed hypothyroidism after iodinated 
contrast media exposure; suggesting that preterm infants have an increased risk of hypothyroid 
c
ompared to term infants. The authors noted that all studies were highly affected by [CONTACT_239583]. A 
retrospective database-study in a mainly adult patient population reported that iodinated contrast 
media exposure was associated with incident hyperthyroidism (odds ratio [OR], 1.98; 95% CI, 
1.08-3.60), while no statistically significant association with incident hypothyroidism was 
obser
ved (OR, 1.58; 95% CI
, 0.95-2.62) (Rhee et al, Arch Int Med, 2012). In secondary analyse s 
CCI
[ADDRESS_1149913] a wide variety of different etiologies including 
Hashimoto thyroiditis, some chromosomal disorders (Down Syndrome, Turner Syndrome), late-
onset congenital hypothyroidism, as well as central hypothyroidism caused by [CONTACT_828713][INVESTIGATOR_828707] (Counts D et al. , 2009). Acquired childhood hypothyroidism, a 
result of decreased thyroid production caused by a failure in the hypothalamus and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], has 
mul
tiple causes including irradiation, drug exposures, iodine deficiency, neurosurgery, head 
trauma, tumors, or thyroid hormone resistance.3,4 Drugs such as thionamides, lithium, 
amiodarone, interferon, and anticonvulsants are known to suppress thyroid function or interfere 
with thyroid synthesis.  
 
We plan to estimate, in a large health maintenance organization (HMO) in Northern [LOCATION_004], 
the rate of detected hypothyroidism in young children (age less than 4 years) exposed to an 
iodi
nated contrast agent.  
8. Research questions and objectives 
8.[ADDRESS_1149914] agent. . 
H
ypothy
roidism cases will be categorized into “probable iodine-induced hypothyroidism” and 
“possible alternative etiology” after medical records review.  
8.2 Secondary objective(s) 
The secondary objective(s) in this study is/are: 
 To de scribe children who have procedures with iodinated contrast agents 
 To de scribe the baseline characteristics of hypothyroidism cases and of the rest of the 
cohort as well as the time-relation between iodine contrast exposure and diagnosis of 
hypothyroidism,  using descriptive statistics. This will be done for all hypothyroidism 
cases and separate ly for the “probable iodine induced” category and the “possible 
alternative etiology” category. In the “probable iodine induced” category we will further

9.2 Setting  
This study will be conducted using data from the Kaiser Permanente Northern [LOCATION_004] 
(KPNC) database, a large US-based HMO database.   
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_1149916] exposure. We will also 
exclude those with lab values for low thyroid (TSH > 5 mU/L for children) any time before the 
10 
 exposure, and those with thyroid replacement therapy, Hashimoto thyroiditis, or congenital 
h
ypothyroidism any time prior to the exposure. 
. 
9.3
 Variables  
 
9.3.1 Baseline characteristics 
 Demographics characteristics (age, sex, year of procedure) 
 C linical characteristics (comorbidities, type of radiological examination, bodyweight, 
he
ight, head-circumference, laboratory values (TSH, T3. T4 anti-thyroid antibodies, if 
a
vailable), and co - medications. 
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_1149917]. We will also identify young children who had a left heart 
catheterization including cardio-angiography, ventriculography, and coronary angiography. Each 
c
hild will be followed for up to 365 days after a qualifying exposure (the exposure window). 
There will be no differentiation according to any specific brand of contrast agents, considering 
that there is general agreement that iodine induced hypothyroidism is considered a class-effect 
of all iodinated contrast agents and not restricted to specific agents 
9.3.3 Outcome measures 
 
Potential cases of hypothyroidism will be defined by: 
 A c oded diagnosis of hypothyroidism and/or 
 A thyroid function tests indicating hypothyroidism and/or 
 Ne w use of thyroid replacement therapy  
 
Cases of hypothyroid will be identified using ICD [ADDRESS_1149918] exposure. We will also 
identify those with lab values for low thyroid (TSH > 5.0 mU/L) or receipt of thyroid 
[ADDRESS_1149919] agent. We will also look for codes that support the 
presence of the hypothyroid condition. For example if a child receives more than one 
pr
escription for thyroid replacement, or has multiple labs with high TSH levels, or multiple 
c
odes for hypothyroidism these will be considered likely cases. We will then obtain original 
clinical notes to validate the diagnosis, by [CONTACT_828714]-existing thyroid 
conditions. Specifically will look for a positive diagnosis of hypothyroid, lab results, repeated 
lab tests, notes of other medications associated with lowered thyroid (see appendix [ADDRESS_1149920]
ugs), and of Hashimoto thyroiditis, radiation, surgical procedures (see appendix [ADDRESS_1149921] of 
pr
ocedures), and congenital forms of hypothyroid.    
Af
ter review of their electronic medical record, detected cases will be classified into: 
 P robable iodine-induced hypothyroidism: no other cause than the previous iodine contrast 
medium exposure could be identified 
 P ossible alternative etiology: Known other diseases (e.g. Hashimoto thyroiditis) or 
treatments (e.g. radiotherapy, drug treatments such as TK inhibitors, interferons, 
amiodarone and others) which may cause hypothyroidism   
 Not a  hypothyroidism case: No evidence of hypothyroidism in the patient’s medical 
record, e.g. coding error 
Esti
mated incidence rates will be calculated for all hypothyroidism cases together, and separate 
for
 “possible iodine induced hypothyroidism” and “possible alternative etiology.”

 Data sources  
KPNC is an integrated health care delivery system providing health care to over 3.8 million 
membe
rs with 3,300 physicians, 32 outpatient clinics and 17 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  Analysis of U.S. census 
data demonstrates that KPNC members are representative of the population living in the served 
geographic area.5,6 KPNC maintains medical information on each patient through a computerized 
12 
 EHR database called “Health Connect” since 2007. Therefore, we have access to high quality 
c
linical data. 
 
Admitting, Discharge and Transfer (ADT) System. A complete database on all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_828708] 1971 is maintained with data that are highly comparable to the UB-92 
forms (required of all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_828709]), and contains a principal and 
up to 12 secondary discharge diagnoses and codes for up to seven procedures for each 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Admitting and discharge diagnoses and procedures are coded according to the 
International Classification of Disease, 9th revision (ICD-9).The accuracy of principal discharge 
diagnoses obtained from Kaiser Permanente databases has been verified in other studies.5,6  
 
The Laboratory Utilization and Reporting System (LURS) is a clinical database that captures all 
laboratory tests and results performed at the Kaiser Permanente of Northern [LOCATION_004] regional 
laboratory since 1991. In 1995, LURS incorporated all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based laboratories of Northern 
C
alifornia. Providers use this system to order tests, obtain results and share them with patients. 
Thus, data in LURS are of higher quality than a chart review study could achieve (since chart 
review involves small rates of reviewer and transcription error). LURS contains patient name, 
medic
al record number, test name (each test has a unique code), date, and result. Essentially all 
th
yroid tests ordered are available in the LURS database.  
 
Outpatient Service Clinical Record (OSCR),  a computerized database, will be a source to 
identify outpatient diagnosis of thyroid disorders.  
 
The database contains a unique identifier for all information on all drugs issued to patients, all 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], captured with ICD-9 coding, outpatient diagnoses and   laboratory tests and 
re
sult.  KPNC membership is stable and more than 97% of members have [ADDRESS_1149922] exposure and diagnosis of hypothyroidism will be described 
using descriptive statistics. This will be done for all hypothyroidism cases and separate ly for the 
“probable iodine induced” category and the “possible alternative etiology” category. In the 
“probable iodine induced” category we will further ascertain the duration of the hypothyroidism 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
If sample size and number of hypothyroidism cases allows, joint associations between possible 
risk factors and hypothyroidism will be examined in a multivariate statistical model (e.g. age, 
sex, bodyweight, type of procedure) 
 
9.8 Quality control  
At the BC
DSP/BU epi[INVESTIGATOR_828710]. All analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_23872] 
e
pi[INVESTIGATOR_828711]. We have procedures for checking 
data to be sure that the data have been correctly identified and classified.  That is, we will check 
the characteristics of the study population to be sure they meet the study criteria by [CONTACT_42574] a 
random sample of electronic case records (“profiles”). We will create cross tabulations to 
de
scribe the characteristics (including age, sex, comorbidities) of the study population and 
compare the results to the limited available epi[INVESTIGATOR_828712] 
c
hildren and exposure to iodine  in US youth. We will do data checks to confirm that person time 
was correctly calculated, and we will review the full electronic patient record to validate cases of 
CCI
[ADDRESS_1149923] members enroll through their employers, many are members of KPNC through 
MediCal (a low-income health insurance plan). Analysis of U.S. census data demonstrates that 
KPNC members are representative of the general population with regard to ethnicity and 
education and differ only slightly with regard to income, we tend to underrepresent the very rich 
and the very poor. Members are remarkably similar to the general population in terms of 
employment status, marital status, screening practices, and prevalence of medical conditions, 
when compared with population-based data from the [LOCATION_004] Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System.   
9.10 Other aspects  
None noted 
 
10. Protection of human subjects 
Data will be derived from a large de-identified database (KPNC) and the study will go through 
the 
 review process to ensure protection of all patients involved. 
 
11. Management and reporting of adverse events/adverse reactions 
As per the EMA Guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (Module VI–Management 
and reporting of adve
rse reactions to medicinal products), for non-interventional study designs 
that are based on secondary use of data, individual reporting of adverse reactions is not 
required. Reports of adverse events/reactions will be summarized in the study report (European 
[COMPANY_003]
15 
 Medicines Agency 2012).  
 
12. Plans for disseminating and communicating study results 
Results will be provided to Bayer Pharma AG in a preliminary repor t no later than March 2017. 
S
tudy results will be published following guidelines of the International Committee of Medical 
Journal Editors (ICMJE, 2013), and communication in appropriate scientific venues will be 
c
onsidered. 
When reporting results of this study, the appropriate STROBE checklist (STROBE, 2007) will 
be followed.

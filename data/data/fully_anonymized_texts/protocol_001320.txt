HRP-593 / v121917 OBJECTIVES: 
The purpose of this study is to develop and pretest the f easibility and preliminary effectiveness of a pragmatic 
approach for population-level obesity management that has a high potential for replication and sustainability in busy primary care settings. This initial study protocol  describes the approaches and procedures that will be 
used to develop and pretest usability of intervention components.  BACKGROUND: 
Collectively, heart diseases, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension account for one-third of all deaths in the U.S. 
and cost more than $[ADDRESS_675241] is overweight.30 
Among obese adults, the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_179559] 14%, 30%, and 34%, 
respectively, whereas those same conditions affect onl y 3%, 12%, and 7% of adults with normal body mass.31 
Not surprisingly, recommendations for healthy behavioral changes and weight loss are considered a cornerstone of both public health and health system efforts to address both overweight/obesity and cardiovascular risk. 
 
P
OPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT – AN ORGANIZING FRAMEWORK FOR PRIMARY CARE: Population health 
management (PHM) is an approach used increasingly by  [CONTACT_520548], with the goal of promoting health and reducing the future need for more costly healthcare 
services.23,[ADDRESS_675242] prior PHM research has focused on preventing exce ssive healthcare encounters by “super-utilizers,” as 
well as the role of patient-centered medical homes to prevent complications and co-morbidities for persons with complex chronic conditions.
[ADDRESS_675243] a 
pragmatic and generalizable framework for population managem ent of obesity that leverages existing primary 
care professionals and technologies to support: 1) proactive patient outreach and assessment; 2) weight loss goal setting & action planning; 3) targeted linkages to evidence-driven intensive lifestyle resources in both clinical and community settings; and 4) the integration of self-weighing data to refine both the form and 
intensity of follow up support services overseen primaril y by a nurse coordinator via existing patient portal, 
telephone, and occasionally face-to-face channels.  
 
STUDY ENDPOINTS: 
The primary endpoint for this initial study is to develop a prototype intervention approach for offering evidence-
based obesity management services that uses a populat ion health management framework and leverages 
widely available electronic health record system (EHRS) technologies, existing members of the primary care 
workforce, and linkages to extant community-based intensive lifestyle intervention resources. This initial study 
will involve two phases (Figure 1): Intervention Development and Intervention Evaluation. Intervention 
Development will use 2 research activities: interviews of healthcare professionals (n=15); patient usability testing (n=10). Intervention Evaluation also involves 2 res earch activities:  a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_520520] (n=80); post-intervention interviews with patients targeted for and exposed to different patient 
engagement and health promotion interventions (n=20). 
 
 
STUDY ACTIVITIES: 
Phase 1: Intervention Development Patient goal setting, brief behavioral counseling, and linkage s to intensive lifestyle programs are already part of 
the practice guidelines for overweight or obese primary care patients with cardiovascular risk factors, our research has been designed to help the Northwestern Medical Group to deploy different available intervention 
STU#: STU00207153 
Version #:  6.0 Version Date:  07.01.2020 Page 4 of 22 
HRP-593 / v121917 components in ways that prove most engaging to patients and most effective in achieving healthy weight 
management. The intervention personnel and technologies al ready exist and are being used to support patient 
care in many areas. However, we will use several forms of research that pose no more than minimal risk to 
patients in order to optimize the use of these interventions in busy practice settings.   The goal of the Intervention Development Phase is to use multi-stakeholder input to assist primary care 
providers within Northwestern Medical Group Primary Care to design and offer a coordinated lifestyle 
intervention “package” that is engaging to patients and optimally effective in promoting healthy weight 
management across the entire patient population. Primary care leadership and IT support experts will ultimately make the final decisions about how available intervention components will be used. Our team of communications experts, behavioral scientists, and implem entation researchers will use theory and strong 
research designs to help inform the intervention choices. 
 Research activities used during the Intervention Devel opment phase include semi-structured interviews with 15 
health professionals and usability tests of technology components with 10 eligible patients. The 15 semi-
structured interviews with relevant health care pr oviders will assess intervention needs, priorities, and 
preferences of clinicians. Using this input, the team wi ll combine new forms of support offered by [CONTACT_520549] (primarily a care coordination nurse) with technology components used for outreach to 
patients; supporting patient goal setting; and providing longitudinal support for healthy lifestyle behaviors and weight management that will be guided by [CONTACT_2363] a cell ular-enabled electronic body weight scale that each 
patient may use in their home to connect information about their progress and weight loss success to the NMG electronic health record. Prior to studying these interventions using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_520521] [ADDRESS_675244] limited usability tests of new patient-facing intervention IT components with 10 
primary care patients. This phase will likely inform smal l intervention refinements prior to advancing to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_146115].  Phase 2: Intervention Evaluation 
The novel combination of existing lifestyle intervention components resulting from phase 1 of the research will 
subsequently be evaluated using a pragmatic randomized interv ention design. The goal of this research is to 
evaluate the new cluster of interventions, which we call Coordinating Pragmatic Primary care Population management for Obesity (C3PO), among a sample of patients who are representative of all patients who might be offered the intervention in routine practice. Thus, instead of recruiting highly selected research volunteers for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], we will use a pragmatic randomization design that will use a “behind the scenes” 
randomization approach to assign 80 eligible patients to receive Basic Resources and Services for healthy 
lifestyle support (n=40) or the C3PO pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393] (n=40). We will not collect data for research purposes only in this trial. Rather, we will use routinely collect ed clinical data (i.e. available from the electronic health 
record) for each patient. Following completion of the 4-month pi[INVESTIGATOR_414753], we will then recruit and consent 
20 patients who were eligible for the intervention to complete semi-structured interviews to assess patient 
experiences, perceptions, and barriers faced during the inte rvention period. This final step will help to inform 
any additional relevant intervention refinements prior to conducting a larger and more definitive future trial of the intervention’s effectiveness.

THE INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT PHASE HAS 4 GENERAL OBJECTIVES : 
1) A SSESS HEALTHCARE PROVIDER PERCEPTIONS REGARDING C3PO  INTERVENTION NEEDS , PRIORITIES , AND 
PREFERENCES  
2) A SSESS EXISTING RESOURCES & WORKFLOWS

INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES 1 & 2: ASSESS C3PO  INTERVENTION NEEDS , PRIORITIES , AND 
PREFERENCES ; ASSESS EXISTING RESOURCES & WORKFLOWS : The C3PO intervention requires both provider- 
and patient-facing communication and behavioral support tools. The needs, priorities, and preferences of 
providers for supporting health behaviors, weight loss, and cardiovascular risk factor management of their own overweight and obese patients is not well understood. We will conduct semi-structured healthcare provider interviews with [ADDRESS_675245] successful supporting the adoption of physical activity, healthier eating, and weight loss goals

HRP-593 / v121917 among adult patients. These components have been abstracted from the published literature and will be 
incorporated into the existing NMG practice IT resources and workflows in ways that are pragmatic and sustainable. These evidence based intervention components,  and the proposed process for incorporating them 
into C3PO is explained below under Intervention Development Objective 3.  
 
I
NTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE 3: INTEGRATE EXISTING PRACTICE ACTIVITIES WITH NEW IT 
COMPONENTS NEEDED FOR POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT TO BE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE : Integration of 
new intervention components into existing IT resources and workflows will be needed in both provider- and patient-facing directions. Because the population management of obesity and of cardiovascular risk have become priorities of NMG practice leadership, interv ention development is not considered a research-only 
activity, but rather, it is a practice driven priority t hat will be supported by [CONTACT_520550]. Thus, all technology 
development and programming will be led by [CONTACT_520551], with collaborative input 
from the local NMG practice leadership and our academic research team.   Provider-facing IT Development:  Informed by [CONTACT_31576]-structured interviews with members of the primary 
healthcare team, the deployment of C3 PO will leverage existing clinical IT  and workflows within Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39457]’s 
provider-facing Ambulatory EHRS application. Draw ing upon existing population health management tools 
currently used by [CONTACT_520552], such as patients with 
congestive heart failure, we anticipate that provider s will express some need for an overweight/obesity 
population management dashboard, tools for individual- or batch-outreach communications with patients within this population; and some means to efficiently track and filt er the entire overweight patient population based on 
whether or not patients have achieved specific goals or outcomes relating to weight management or 
cardiovascular risk. The classification of a group of pati ents with a particular condition or health risk such as 
overweight/obesity into a dedicated list that can be used for clinical communications and care coordination is commonly called a patient registry. As NM Epic IT builds su ch a clinical patient registry for NMG providers, we 
will work with the Epic IT team to ensure that the needs, priorities, and preferences expressed during semi-structured interviews with providers (below) are considered in the design of these provider-facing intervention development components.  
 
Patient-facing IT Development:  Building on extensive prior research, the C3PO intervention will apply 
evidence-based principles for providing the essential components of effective behavioral weight management 
interventions, including: 1) Individualized goal setting ; 2) Self-monitoring of body weight; 3) Supportive 
accountability for achieving self-management goals and obje ctives; 4) Linkages to community or clinical 
intensive lifestyle support programs; and 5) Targeted, person-centered follow-up support. Technology 
platforms tethered to the EHRS will help coordinate communication and the delivery of different forms of 
support between clinical encounters. Existing members of the primary care team will provide support at a minimum level necessary. The intensity of human support will be guided by [CONTACT_6904]’s decisions about goal setting, their self-weighing behavior, and weekly progress toward their individual weight goal. Supportive 
communication, the negotiation of individual goals, and tar geted problem solving will be facilitated by [CONTACT_520553][INVESTIGATOR_520522]. An existing 
primary care nurse coordinator will function as a population health management (PHM) nurse, who will manage the outreach messaging with all patients included in the clinical patient registry. C3PO will utilize 
secure patient-facing EHRS technologies to deliver recommendations of the patient’s own primary care 
provider via the practice team’s PHM nurse. For patients who request additional information or assistance in 
goal setting or decision making, the PHM nurse will offer a telephone or face-to-face encounter as an 
alternative. The planned approaches for supporting goal setti ng, self-monitoring, and intensive intervention 
linkages are described further below.  
1) Individualized Goal Setting:  Even in the presence of strong external support, adherence to a 
particular behavior is unlikely unless one understands the reasons for the behavior and has explicit 
expectations about the intended goal(s).
13 Providing support for goal setting involves helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a patient 
to articulate a clear expectation for which he/she will feel committed and accountable.78 The C3PO 
intervention will stimulate goal setting among eligible patients by [CONTACT_520554]-automated outreach messages that are delivered via Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39457]’s MyChart patient portal. Outreach messages will adopt 
STU#: STU00207153 
Version #:  6.0 Version Date:  07.01.2020 Page 7 of 22 
HRP-593 / v121917 components of the 5Rs of tobacco cessation to brie fly frame the relevance, risks, and rewards of 
lifestyle changes leading to modest weight loss.79,80 Using MyChart’s branching logic survey function, 
patients will then be guided through the steps of a brief action planning procss,[ADDRESS_675246] changed. Patients who 
do indicate readiness will be guided through simple steps to set a SMART goal (Specific, Measurable, 
Achievable, Relevant, and Timed) for weight loss. Brie f probing questions will guide development of this 
goal, and individual patient responses will be stored in the EHRS. The branching logic of each step will 
automate the bulk of this process for most patients, while preserving a patient’s perspective that he/she 
is communicating directly with the PHM nurse, who is working with his/her own PCP. Based on 
individual patient responses at each step, the branching logic will trigger a specific next step of validation, motivational messaging, and additional brief questioning, which are guided by [CONTACT_102]’s level of readiness and perceived self-efficacy. For example, individuals who indicate needing suggestions for a goal will be presented with two to three ideas that “other patients have told us are 
very helpful.” If this helps the individual choose a goal area, the questionnaire will then confirm a 
commitment statement, for example: “Just to make sure we understand your plan correctly, you want to 
X. Is that correct?” After confirming the commitment, the patient will be asked about their confidence 
with reaching the goal. Those expressing high confidence will be given encouragement and asked about their preference for when we should check in with them again. Patients with only modest or low 
confidence will be asked if they have ideas about what might raise their confidence. Patients with low confidence will receive reassurance and an offer for a telephone call from the PHM nurse to discuss steps to help build their confidence.   
2) Self-monitoring of Body Weight:  Prior research suggests that process accountability (e.g. 
accountability over self-weighing) increases completion of a target behavior even more than outcome 
accountability alone (e.g. accountability over achieving a weight loss goal).
[ADDRESS_675247] research has found to be strongly predictive of weight loss success.
12 C3PO will provide each patient with a BodyTr ace electronic scale (eScale), which transmits 
weight data wirelessly to a secure, private repository using digital mobile telecommunications technology (i.e. the same cellular networks as a smartphone). The manufacturer reports accuracy 
within +/-0.1 kg to a weight limit of about 150 kg (330 lbs.).
81 This approach, used in prior research by 
[CONTACT_27156],82 also enables the seamless integration of self-weighing information back into the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_520523] (i.e. back to the registry as well as to the PHM nurse). This integration will allow dynamic individualized feedback from the nurse back to each patient in a way that further strengthens supportive accountability and progress toward weight goals. More details are provided below. 
 
3) Supportive Accountability for Achieving Self-management Goals and Objectives: Nurse-patient 
interactions, largely facilitated by [CONTACT_520555], will be designed to strengthen each patient’s commitment toward their goal, as well as a greater sense of “ supportive accountability .” 
Accountability toward a behavior exists when an individual has an expectation that he/she may be called upon to justify his/her actions or inactions to another person.
13 Accountability requires real or 
perceived social interactions with another human (i.e. a coach) who the patient views as trustworthy 
and possessing suitable expertise. This relationship may be established in person, by [CONTACT_756], or via 
an electronic channel. C3PO will utilize secure patient-facing EHRS technologies to deliver recommendations of the patient’s own primary care provider via the practice team’s PHM nurse. For 
patients who request additional information or assistance in goal setting or decision making, the PHM 
nurse will offer a telephone or face-to-face encounter as an alternative. The planned approaches for 
supporting goal setting, self-monitoring, and intensive intervention linkages are described further below. 
 
4) Linkages to Evidence-based Lifestyle Interventions : Once patients have set a goal and begun using 
their eScale, the PHM intervention will utilize MyChart messaging to offer a selection of links to 
STU#: STU00207153 
Version #:  6.0 Version Date:  07.01.2020 Page 8 of 22 
HRP-593 / v121917 available lifestyle programs and services, with brie f summary information about benefits and attributes 
to help in making choices among them, or to facilitate  a request for additional information or assistance 
from the PHM nurse. Based on the key characteri stics of evidence-based intensive lifestyle 
programs,12,[ADDRESS_675248] identified an array of extant lifestyle interventions to include in a menu of initial 
program choices for each patient.  
5) Targeted, Person-centered Follow-up Support:  The PHM framework attempts to provide basic 
support to all patients and uses “lighter touches” with patients who are engaged and having success; more intensive support is reserved for patients who are less successful. C3PO will use the frequency 
and results of self-weighing to stratify patients to different forms of support. Immediately after a patient sets a weight goal, the PHM nurse will ship him/her an eScale and welcome package, including 
additional support materials and instructions for initializing the scale and registering a first body weight. 
If there is no weight received from the eScale within [ADDRESS_675249] weight will receive a MyChart message offering praise and relisting a short menu of linkages where the patient can find further information about evidence-based community programs. All messages will also offer an option 
of telephonic support from the PHM nurse. 
 After the eScale is initialized and weight #1 is receiv ed, each patient will be classified weekly by [CONTACT_520556]-weighing (i.e. weekly vs. less than weekly) and whether they do/don’t meet or exceed their target weight for the week. Patients who continue to self-weigh but who are not at their progress 
goal will receive an automated MyChart message praising them for their self-weighing and summarizing 
their weight loss progress. They will be offered additio nal help and the opportunity to speak directly with 
the PHM nurse to identify barriers and reassess and refine their action plan if desired. Patients who request different lifestyle resources will be given information about other linkages, such as a nearby [CONTACT_520557].  
 Patients who are continuing to self-weigh and who are reaching or exceeding the progress target for their individual weight loss goal will receive a MyChart message summarizing weight loss progress, 
along with praise and positive feedback to reinforce actions and behaviors that are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Links to community and clinical resources to provide ongoing s upport will again be listed. The timing and exact 
content of these messages will be developed and refined during the first 6 months of intervention 
delivery, with input from clinicians, patients, and behavioral and communications experts who comprise the research team.

INTERVIEWER NOTE: TURN RECORDER ON 
 Background & Objective: 
Why we are doing interviews: 
We are interested in whether new technologies and communica tion tools that are linke d to the Epic EHR can 
help primary care teams support their patients’ goals around healthier eating, physical activity, and weight loss.  
Before studying whether these technologies  will work, we want to ensure that  they benefit the healthcare team 
and are easy and efficient to use.  Th ey also should fit into existing prac tice workflows not interfere with other 
functions of different members of the care team.    The purpose of this interview is to gather insights from healthcare professionals  like you to both better 
understand your current work flow, as well as obtain your opi[INVESTIGATOR_520525] l work for the care team.  
 
Current Workflow 
The following questions relate to your  roles and the current workflow in the primary care relevant to supporting 
weight loss and management am ong the patients you serve.  
1. What is your role in supporting healthy eatin g, exercise, and weight loss by [CONTACT_520559]?  
PROBE: What are the roles of other team members? For exampl e, Nurses? Medical Assistants? 
Care Coordination Nurses? Othe r members of the care team? 
 
2. In your opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], what have you found to be mo st motivating for your patients to help them 
achieve…  
Healthy eating? 
Exercise?  Weight loss? 
 
3. How does the care team communicate with each other,  if at all, regarding healthy eating, exercise 
and weight loss relevant to patien ts in need of these services? 
PROBE: How do care team memb ers communicate verbally, via documentation in Epic, or 
through other channels? 
PROBE: What are existing challenges rela ted to these communication channels?  
PROBE: What suggestions or thoughts do you have based on your  experiences that you think 
could overcome the challenges you identified? 
 
4. What is the role of other resources and services available to patients of Northwestern Medicine? 
(Such as referrals to services like, SEE BELOW) 
PROBE: The Northwestern Medici ne Health Learning Center? 
PROBE: The Northwestern Medici ne Lifestyle Medicine Clinic? 
PROBE: Other resources and services in th e community? (i.e. DPP, Weight Watchers) 
 
Overview of the Intervention:  
The goal of this intervention is to use existing Epic platforms and re mote intervention technologies to improve 
goal setting, self-weighing, and ongoing support for overw eight and obese patients while MINIMIZING any 
additional work for members of the primary care team. We plan to do this by [CONTACT_520560]#: STU00207153 
Version #:  6.0 Version Date:  07.01.2020 Page 10 of 22 
HRP-593 / v121917 via an automated MyChart message, sending them a wireless  eScale that transmits weight data back into Epic, 
and providing tailored support through automated MyChart messaging with support from a nurse care 
coordinator (like “STAFF NAM E”) over a 10-week period.  
We’d like to get your initial impr essions on the implications for the practice and recommendations for a 
successful rollout of this intervention.  
5. What , if anything , do you foresee as being pote ntial barriers to implementing this intervention?    
PROBE: What challenges, if any, do you think we might face in implementi ng this intervention?  
PROBE: For example, a patient may message physicia ns directly in response to outreach messaging, 
how might we prepare the practi ce so this is not a problem? 
 
6. How would you recommend we introduce this to th e practice to make sure the broader care team 
is aware of this interven tion when it goes live?  
 
 
7. Our intervention plans to collect weight loss goals and patient weights every time they step on the 
scale, and goal setting progress. Which of these data would you want to see?  
 
PROBE: What is your preferred method for viewing/ receiving these data (i.e., weight graphs, total 
amount of weight lost, most recent weight prior to primary care vi sit) and how often? 
 
 
Wrap-up:  
8. Is there anything else you think we should know  or consider regarding how to support primary 
care teams to assist patients in in creasing their physical activity, ea ting better, or losing weight?  
 
9. Is there anything else I didn’t ask you to day that you’d like to comment on? 
 
Thank you for your time.

Research Activity #2 : Each patient participant (n=10) will take part in a 60 to 90-minute videotaped session 
during which they will go through all steps of the logging in, opening the MyChart message, entering responses to the goal setting / action planning survey prompts, and navigating community resource links and other 
associated patient decision support. [CONTACT_520586] and [CONTACT_311268] will facilitate and observe all usability 
testing, noting preferred navigation paths and the nature of any errors or sources of confusion. Noldus software will record user-system interaction (i.e., logging mous e click, keystrokes) and will organize the data and 
analyses. After the first three participants, [CONTACT_311268] and [CONTACT_520586] will meet with the Epic programmers to review key findings and refine the system interfaces to enhance usability. After the second wave, any 
remaining enhancements to optimize workflow integration will  be made before launch of the future pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].

INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR EACH RESEARCH ACTIVITY 
Research Activity #1: With approval of the NMG practice direct or, 15 primary care professionals will be 
recruited as participants, including the PHM nurse, practi ce administrators, physicians, and other primary care 
team members (e.g. nurses; health educators). Inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows:   
 
Table 2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for Professionals Completing Interviews 
  
Inclusions  Exclusions 
Staff members employed at Northwestern Medical Group (e.g.  MD, NP, PA, 
health educator, care manager, practice administrator) involved in the 
managemen t of cardiovascular risk data collection and o besity management  NMG staff involved in protocol development 
 
Research Activities #2, #3, and #4:   With approval of the NMG practice director, eligible patients will be 
identified by [CONTACT_520562]. The query will 
identify patients who meet the eligibility criteria for t he clinical weight management services, as detailed in 
Table [ADDRESS_675250] had 1 or more routine (non-urgent) visits to t he NMG primary care practice and will have an active 
MyChart account with one or more log-in attempts  within 12 months. Body mass index (BMI) will be 
determined using the last available height and weight (must be within 12 months). BMI is calculated as (weight 
in kg) ÷ (height in meters)2. CVD risk conditions will be determined by [CONTACT_520563]: 1) a 
diagnosis of hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], diabetes, or prediabetes (i.e. one or more ambulatory encounter 
with an ICD encounter diagnosis code or active probl em specifying either type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, 
hypertension, or abnormal blood cholesterol); 2) an active prescription drug order for an antilipi[INVESTIGATOR_520528], long or intermediate acting insulin analog, or oral antiglycemic medication. Pregnant women will be 
excluded from the study, as participation involves setting a weight loss goal, which may not be medically 
appropriate for all pregnant women. 
 
Patient usability testing of technology components (Research Activity #2) will occur before the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. The clinical database manager will draw names randomly from the patient eligibility list for the clinical service 
(Table 3), and patients will be recruited until [ADDRESS_675251] completed the usability tests.   
The pragmatic trial (Research Activity #3) will be completed following development and usability testing of the 
new intervention technology components. The pragmatic trial will target all patients eligible for the clinical service (Table 3). All patients meeting these eligibility criteria who open an outreach MyChart message that 
offers the intervention components and who indicate thei r interest in receiving weight management support 
from the clinical team will be included in the evaluation until [ADDRESS_675252] been accrued. From among all 
patients who are deemed eligible but who are not recruited, a no-intervention comparison group of 80 
additional patients also will be selected for additional comparisons.

RECRUITMENT METHODS 
Research Activity #1: After securing approval from the NMG practice operations director and quality committee 
to proceed with recruitment, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_520529] a list of all practice employees who are involved in the care of overweight or obese patie nts. Working off this list, [ADDRESS_675255] mix of professionals, 
including the population health management (PHM) nurse, practice administrators, physicians, and other 
primary care team members (e.g. nurses; health educators). Practice leadership will not be involved in recruitment efforts aside from providing the initial list of staff members.   Study team members will visit the NMG primary care clinic and present details of the study to the practice 
leaders and medical staff during a weekly practice busines s meeting. Interested providers can sign up to be

HRP-593 / v121917 contact[CONTACT_232562]. After this meeting, the providers and staff will also receive an email (example 
below) from the study project manager, describing the re search once again, identifying [CONTACT_311268] as the 
PI, and inviting their participation. Providers who do not reply to the email will be phoned (script below) as an alternative approach to confirm interest and proceed with scheduling. Volunteers will be offered $[ADDRESS_675256] the volunteers to schedule the interview in a private location at or near the clinical practice site and at a time and date that is mutually convenient. A template and phone 
script for provider recruitment materials can be found appended to the protocol. 
 
 
Research Activity #2: Ten overweight or obese patients  with at least one cardiovascular risk factor will be 
recruited for limited usability testing of new patient-facing technologies to support weight loss.  With approval of 
the NMG practice director, eligible patients will be id entified by [CONTACT_520564]. The query will identify patients who meet the eligibility criteria in Table [ADDRESS_675257] had 1 or more routine (non-urgent) visits to the NMG primary care practice, and who have an 
active MyChart account with one or more log-in attempts  within [ADDRESS_675258] process for pati ent recruitment approved by [CONTACT_520565] a MyChart staff message to each  primary care provider (PCP) of those 40 patients. 
PCPs will be notified via Epic email regarding which of their patients are eligible and will be given the option of 
excluding any specific patient(s) from being recruited. PCPs  will be given [ADDRESS_675259] protocol that 
the NMG practice has approved, as it provides sufficient advanced notification to providers, with the ability to 
exclude any patients as needed, while presenting minima l administrative burden to provider’s existing 
workload.  
 
Once eligible patients are identified, an opt-out recruitment letter will be mailed to eligible patients with a 
number to call to remove themselves  from further recruitment contacts.  
 
Five days following mailing the letter, study staff will call  patients who have not opted-out to explain the nature 
of the project and the procedures for the study. To be included in the study, participants must be willing to undergo screening.  
 
Research Activity #3: For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_146119], [ADDRESS_675260] the 
entire target group, having had 1 or more routine (non-urgent) visits to the NMG primary care practice, and 
who have an active MyChart account with one or more log-in attempts within [ADDRESS_675261], attempting to target patients who completed a recent clinic encounter (in the preceding 1 to 3 week period). After generating this shorter list, the clinical database manager will follow a standard process for patient recruitment approved by [CONTACT_520566] a MyChart staff message to each 
primary care provider (PCP) of those 100 patients. PCPs will be notified via Epic email regarding which of their 
patients are eligible and will be given the option of excludi ng any specific patient(s) from being recruited. PCPs 
will be given 5 days to respond to Epic message to exclude a patient. No response will be considered assent to recruit patient. This process will be repeated every 2 weeks until target enrollment goal (n=80) is reached. This is a standard protocol that the NMG practice has approved, as it provides sufficient advanced notification to providers, with the ability to exclude any patients as needed, while presenting minimal administrative burden to 
provider’s existing workload.

HRP-593 / v121917  
Once eligible patients are identified, a recruitment message will be sent via Epic MyChart inviting patients to 
complete a MyChart survey assessing weight loss interest and goal setting as described above in Patient-
facing IT Development . All eligible patients who receive the MyChart message and affirm their weight loss 
interest and goals will be included in the pragmatic evaluation sample and randomized. 
 
For the no-intervention comparison arm, patients will be identified from the list of approximately 1,[ADDRESS_675262] 80 patients with similar age and sex characteristics as trial participants. 
Patients in this no-intervention comparison group will not  be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], will receive no intervention, and only 
their routinely collected clinical data will be used fo r the retrospective comparison evaluation (i.e. the same 
existing clinical data elements used to assess outcomes for the trial groups), so they will not receive contact [CONTACT_520567]. Detailed information about consent and HIPAA waivers is described below in 
“CONSENT PROCESS” section  
 
 
Research Activity #4: For the semi-structured interv iews, the database manager will draw names randomly 
from the pragmatic trial recruitment list until [ADDRESS_675263] completed the interview. After obtaining approval 
from the primary care provider, a research assistant (RA)  will send a lead letter by [CONTACT_520568] [ADDRESS_675264] interested participants to provide informed consent prior to completion of a one-time interview.  
 
COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIP ATION IN RESEARCH ACTIVITIES 
Research Activity #1: Each volunteering health care professional (n=15) will be compensated $[ADDRESS_675265].  Research Activity #2: Patient participants (n=10 pat ients) will be reimbursed $[ADDRESS_675266]. Research Activity 
#4: For phone interviews, each patient participant will be compensated $25 for their participation in a 20 minute 
interview. For in-person interviews, each patient participant will be compensated $[ADDRESS_675267].  
WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS 
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time. There are no specific criteria for administratively removing a patient from the study. However, a patient wi ll be removed if continued participation is determined 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_520530] a danger to the patient’s health or well-being. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_520531]. If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_520532], the 
patient will be removed and all appropriate referrals will be made. The IRB will be informed. 
 
RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS  
Research Activity #1: It is possible that some interview topi[INVESTIGATOR_520533]. Any participants who have an adver se reaction to discussing sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_520534]-person interviews will be comforted, allowed to stop the interview, and referred for further support, if requested, by [CONTACT_520569]. All clin ical provider participants 
who complete the consent process will be informed that participation may result in a loss of privacy, since 
persons other than the investigators may view their st udy data if deemed necessary for oversight purposes. 
However, they will be informed that their NMG employ ers, supervisors, and practice leadership will only 
receive information about the general conclusions of all in terview findings, in aggregate; no individual interview 
audio recordings or the transcription of these activiti es will be shared beyond the research team, except if

Version #:  6.0 Version Date:  07.01.2020 Page 16 of 22 
HRP-593 / v121917 required by [CONTACT_520570]. Even though our study will store all data on secure, password 
protected, Northwestern University network drive folders,  all audio files will be destroyed once the research is 
completed.  Research Activity #2: It is possible that discussing sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_520535]. Usability tests also may cause distress or stigma for some individuals who feel 
uncomfortable being directly observed in their work role s. All participants who complete the consent process 
will be informed that participation may result in a loss of privacy, since persons other than the investigators may view their study data if deemed necessary for oversi ght purposes. However, they will be informed that 
their health care providers and NMG practice leader ship will only receive information about the general 
conclusions of the usability testing, in aggregate; no indivi dual interview video recordings or the transcription of 
these activities will be shared with care providers at the clinic who are not part of the research team, except if 
required by [CONTACT_520570]. Even though our study will store all data on secure, password 
protected, Northwestern University network drive folders,  all video files will be destroyed once the research is 
completed. 
 
Research Activity #3: It is possible that completing a survey on weight loss, engaging in weight loss goal 
setting, and/or weight loss activities can sometimes be distressing to some patients. All participants will be 
provided with the option of speaking with their primary care provider or another member of their health care team about their questions or concerns when completing the MyChart survey and when receiving all additional 
outreach and follow up messaging via My Chart. 
 
 
Research Activity #4: It is possible that discussing sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_520536]. Any participants who have an adverse reaction to discussing sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_520537]-person interviews will be comforted, allowed to stop the interview, and referred for further support, if 
requested, by [CONTACT_520571]. All participants who complete the consent process will be 
informed that participation may result in a loss of privacy, since persons other than the investigators may view their study data if deemed necessary for oversight purposes. However, they will be informed that their health care providers and NMG practice leadership will only re ceive information about the general conclusions of the 
interviews, in aggregate; no individual interview recordings or  transcription will be shared with care providers at 
the clinic who are not part of the research team, except  if required by [CONTACT_520570]. Even though 
our study will store all data on secure, password protect ed, Northwestern University network drive folders, all 
video files will be destroyed once the research is completed. 
 
 
All research staff who participate in patient usability tests and provider and patient interviews will have 
completed human subjects training, including sensitivity regarding the potential for survey procedures or direct 
observation to cause anxiety and other forms of emotional adverse effects. Staff members will be trained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_520538] “if it is okay to continue.” Patient participants who become visibly upset or who express the desire to stop wi ll be asked whether the tests are causing them to 
feel uncomfortable. Any participant who expresses upset or anx iety will be asked if they prefer to stop the test. 
Participants who stop prematurely will still be compensated and thanked for their time. Those who terminate 
the test early or who state at the conclusion that the tests were upsetting will be asked if they wish to speak to 
[CONTACT_311268] or to another healthcare provider from the clinic. Patients requesting additional emotional support will be offered immediate full clinical services of the Northwestern Medical Group.    Measures to decrease risk will involve conducting all provid er/staff/patient interviews and patient usability tests 
in a private and discreet fashion and giving persons an opportunity to ask questions or voice concerns. All 
participants who complete the consent process will be informed that participation may result in a loss of privacy, since persons other than the investigators may view their study data if deemed necessary for oversight purposes. However, they will be informed that only general conclusions about the aggregate results of our research will be shared with other health providers, NMG leadership, or supervisors; no individual audio or video recordings or the transcription of these activiti es will be shared with anyone who is not part of the

HRP-593 / v121917 research team. Even though our study will store all data on secure, password protected, Northwestern 
University network drive folders, all audio and video file s and other identifying information will be destroyed 
once the research is completed. In compliance with guidelines for comparative effectiveness trials, we will also establish an internal data and safety monitoring plan to ensure the safety of study subjects. Protections against these risks are described further below. (see Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  below).
 
 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO PARTICIPANTS 
The proposed study has the potential to improve co mmunity and healthcare clinical strategies for 
cardiovascular health promotion and disease prevention for a large number of overweight and obese adults.  The interventions are designed to build capacity, improv e practice, and enhance overall population health.   
 
The health IT and primary care delivery system interv entions under evaluation will be designed to address a 
critical gap in health care delivery systems and has great promise for expanding the reach and effectiveness of 
health promotion efforts involving the coordination of c linical and community resources and services to address 
overweight and obesity. Our evaluation will provide crit ical information for stakeholders to help them make 
more informed decisions about whether it is feasible and effective to use existing new technologies in the management of overweight and obesity to improve the prevention and care for adults cardiovascular risk 
conditions.  
For patients, the study will help to answer whether it is worthwhile to conduct additional research regarding 
novel interventions that use health IT to provide new information, referrals, and feedback about health promotion resources across clinical and community  settings to improve knowledge about community 
resources, increase goal setting, support behavior change, and result in greater weight loss success. 
 
DATA MANAGEMENT AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
Best practices will be employed by [CONTACT_520572]. The participant tracking database will use Research Electr onic Data Capture (REDCap) through a FSM computer 
with secure wireless VPN connection to Northwestern servers. Once the study is complete and data have been collected and passed the audit process, the research manager will make the data available to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-Investigators. Only copi[INVESTIGATOR_520539].  
Interviews with primary care professionals will be digita lly audio recorded and then transcribed verbatim by [CONTACT_208004], externally contracted tr anscriptionist. Content analysis of transcripts will be used to code small 
portions of the text representing unique concepts. Methods of open and axial coding will be employed to analyze the data. Digital audio files of interviews collec ted will be kept on a password-secured computer with 
the study ID as the identifier. After completion of the study, the digital audio tapes will be deleted. All participants will be identified by [CONTACT_520573] a name [CONTACT_520583], so that their identity and personal information will be kept as confidential as possible. 
 
For usability tests, Noldus software will record user-sys tem interaction (i.e., logging mouse click, keystrokes) 
and will organize the data and analyses. Digital video files and transcripts of usability tests, and digital audio 
files and transcripts of provider interviews, will be stored under a filename [CONTACT_520584] a coded studyID (not a 
participant’s name) on a password-secured Northwestern Un iversity network folder. Participant names, contact 
[CONTACT_3031], any other personal identifiers, and a key file  linking those identifiers with coded studyID’s will be 
stored in a separate password-secured file folder. After comp letion of the study, all digital files will be deleted. 
 Interviews with patients will be digitally audio recorded and then transcribed verbatim by [CONTACT_50210], 
externally contracted transcriptionist. Participants will re ceive a lead letter with the option to opt out of phone 
recruitment. Interviewers will conduct all phone interviews in a private space. Content analysis of transcripts 
will be used to code small portions of the text repres enting unique concepts. Methods of open and axial coding 
will be employed to analyze the data. Digital audio files of  interviews collected will be kept on a password-
secured computer with the study ID as the identifier. After completion of the study, the digital audio tapes will be deleted. All participants will be identified by [CONTACT_520574] a name [CONTACT_520585]#: STU00207153 
Version #:  6.0 Version Date:  07.01.2020 Page 18 of 22 
HRP-593 / v121917 database and in the digital audio files, so that their identity and personal information will be kept as confidential 
as possible.  
 In addition, to help us protect the confidentiality of parti cipants we have a Certificate of Confidentiality from the 
National Institutes of Health, which will protect against attempts by [CONTACT_520575]. To help us protect patient’s  privacy, a Certificate of Confidentiality from the 
National Institutes of Health is in place. The researchers can use this Certificate to legally refuse to disclose 
information that may identify patients in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or 
other proceedings, for example, if there is a court subpoena. The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify patients. The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent patients from voluntarily releasing information about them selves or involvement in this research. If an insurer, 
medical care provider, or other person obtains a participant’s written consent to receive research information, 
then the researchers will not use the Certificate to withhold that information. 
 
PROVISIONS TO MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF PARTICIPANTS 
It is important to understand that the intervention is no t an experimental drug or device but represents the 
introduction of new electronic tools and workflows into healthcare delivery (changes that could be adopted by 
[CONTACT_520576] ). Commensurate with the very low level of risk to 
participants, we will use a data safety and monitoring plan that is led by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_520540]. The plan includes prompt reporting of any unanticipated or serious adverse events that become known to the study team through process measurement and semi-structured patient 
interviews. In such cases, these findings will be communicated immediately to the sponsor (NIDDK) and to the NU Institutional Review Board. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_520541]. Study investigators will monitor the integrity of the research and the safety of participants.  The IRB and 
[CONTACT_311268] (PI) will assess after any such events  if revisions are required to the study procedures.
 
 
PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE PRIV ACY INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS 
Healthcare providers who work in the primary care practice will be asked to participate after a general 
announcement is made at a routine business meeting about the purpose of the research. Secure emails will be 
sent by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_520542], enabling them to discreetly opt out of further 
contact. Recruitment procedures will not involve superviso rs or other members of the practice leadership. All 
interviews will be conducted in a discreet setting at or near the practice setting, where voices cannot be overheard by [CONTACT_2312]. Only minimal identifying information that is needed to conduct this research will be collected, stored, and analyzed. Audio recordings of interviews will be transcribed, analyzed, and then 
destroyed. When sharing results / findings beyond the re search team, only general aggregate findings, 
illustrative quotes, or themes will be used. No data or results will be shared in a way that could identify an 
individual participant.  
 
Patients who are recruited for limited usability testing will be identified using a clinical electronic health record query conducted by a NM data manager. Primary care provi ders of those patients will be informed of the study 
and asked if they believe there is a reason why one or more of their own patients should not be contact[CONTACT_520577]. Only patients who are believed eligible and potentially interested after these filtering steps will be 
recruited. Emailed letters will be sent directly to t hose patients by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_30496], enabling them to 
learn about the study and to discreetly and easily opt out of further contact. Recruitment procedures will not directly involve the patient’s own primary care provider . The study team will conduct all telephone recruitment 
calls and subsequent usability testing in a discreet setting  at or near the practice setting, where voices cannot 
be overheard by [CONTACT_2312]. Only minimal patient identifiers and PHI needed to conduct this research will be 
collected, stored, and analyzed. Video recordings of usability tests will be transcribed, analyzed, and then destroyed. When sharing results / findings beyond the re search team, only general aggregate findings, 
illustrative quotes, or themes will be used. No data or results will be shared in a way that could identify an individual participant.

HRP-593 / v121917 All research personnel have received training in research related to Human Subjects. Access will remain 
consistent to those on the Authorized Personnel list of the IRB approved protocol.  Study documentation will be 
retained for a period of five years following completion of data analysis, manuscript preparation, and report submission. All research databases will be password protec ted and accessible only to the research team and 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Any key files that link coded identifiers with NM patient identifiers will not be shared with the study team. Using these methods, which we have used in prior studies, we will be compliant 
with the “Standards for Privacy of Individual Identifi able Health Information” under the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. We will obtain approval from our IRB prior to the study start date.
 
 ECONOMIC BURDEN TO PARTICIPANTS 
Participants should have no additional costs because of participation in the research.  
 
CONSENT PROCESS 
This Human Subject Research falls under Biomedical Resear ch with minimal risk to participants. The research 
will involve usability tests involving individual patients and interviews with primary care professionals, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_146115], and follow up interviews with eligible participants. The consent process for each activity varies 
and is described in detail below: 
 Research Activity #1: Primary care professional staff wi ll be presented with a written explanation of the study 
and given an opportunity to have any potential questions answered. Prior to their participation in individual interviews, participants will provide written informed cons ent. The consent form outlines the potential risks, 
expected benefits, and the manner in which confidentiality will be maintained. The consent form also offers 
assurances that the participant can withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. 
 
At the agreed upon time of the staff member’s interview, the research assistant (RA) or PI [INVESTIGATOR_520543]/her to a quiet, closed-door office and will read the consent document and explain the details of the study in such a way that the staff member understands what it would be like to take part in the research study. The RA or PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_520544]. If the staff member has any questions, the RA or PI [INVESTIGATOR_520545], verifying that 
the patient has understood and has no further questions before proceeding. If at any point in the process the participant indicates that he or she does not want to take  part in the research study, the process will stop, and 
the RA will thank the patient for their time. After signing the informed consent, the RA will off the participant a signed copy. A second signed copy of the consent form will be filed in a locked, limited access file cabinet at 
Northwestern research offices and each participant will also be given a copy of the consent form.
 
 
Research Activity #2: Primary care providers will be in formed of this research study during routine business 
meetings of the participating practice and subsequently in wr iting. PCPs will be notified via Epic email of which 
of their patients are eligible for participation and given the option of excluding any from being recruited. PCPs 
will be given [ADDRESS_675268] approach for patient recruitment within the participating clinical practice location and is described in detail under “Recruitment Methods” above. Eligible patients will then be informed of the research by [CONTACT_520578]. Patients interested in proceeding to volunteer for usability testing will be scheduled and enrolled face-to-face by [CONTACT_520579], informed consent, prior to completing those tests.  
 
Consent will be documented in writing. In accordance wi th Northwestern University’s Biomedical Template 
Consent Document, the consent form explains the study, potential risks, expected benefits, and the manner in 
which confidentiality will be maintained. The consent form includes information regarding protections afforded by [CONTACT_333286]. The consent form also offers assurances that the participant can withdraw 
from the study at any time without penalty.  
 At the agreed upon time of a patient’s usability test, the research assistant (RA) will take him/her to a quiet, closed-door office and will read the consent document and ex plain the details of the study in such a way that 
STU#: STU00207153 
Version #:  6.0 Version Date:  07.01.2020 Page 20 of 22 
HRP-593 / v121917 the patient understands what it would be like to take part in the research study. The RA will stop after each 
section of the consent process and ask if the patient has any questions. If there are questions, the RA will 
answer them clearly, verifying that the patient has understood and has no further questions before proceeding. If at any point in the process the patient has questions that he/she does not believe have been addressed adequately by [CONTACT_21118], the RA will page the PI, who will attempt to answer the patient’s question(s) more completely. If at any point in the process the participant indicates that he or she does not want to take part in 
the research study, the process will stop, and the RA wi ll thank the patient for their time. After signing the 
informed consent, the RA will offer the participant a signed copy. A second signed copy of the consent form will be filed in a locked, limited access file cabinet at Northw estern research offices, and each participant will also 
be given a copy of the consent form. 
 
Research Activity #3: For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_146119], pr imary care providers will be informed of this research 
study during routine business meetings of the participating practice and subsequently in writing. PCPs will be 
notified via Epic email of which of their patients are eligible for participation and given the option of excluding any from being recruited. PCPs will be given [ADDRESS_675269] approach for patient 
recruitment within the participating clinical practice location and is described in detail under “Recruitment 
Methods” above. As described in detail below under “Protected Health Information (PHI and HIPAA), a HIPAA 
waiver of consent will apply to patients participating in the pragmatic pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], as the use of participants’ PHI involves no more than minimal risk to the participant, is not collected for research purposes alone, and a detailed plan to protect participant identifiers fr om improper use and disclosure is in place. 
 For the no-intervention comparison group, patients will not  be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], will receive no intervention, and only 
their routinely collected clinical data will be used for the retrospective comparison evaluation (i.e. the same 
existing clinical data elements used to assess outcomes fo r the trial groups) so a waiver of consent will apply 
to participants in this group. As described in detail below under “Protected Health Information (PHI and HIPAA), a HIPAA waiver of consent will also apply to par ticipants in this no-intervention comparison group, as 
the use of participants’ PHI involves no more than minimal risk to the participant, is not collected for research 
purposes alone, and a detailed plan to protect participant identifiers from improper use and disclosure is in 
place. 
 
Research Activity #4: For phone interviews: The research assistant will contact [CONTACT_520580] y in such a way that the patient understands what it 
would be like to take part in the research study. The RA will stop after each section of the consent process and 
ask if the patient has any questions. If there are questions, the RA will answer them clearly, verifying that the 
patient has understood and has no further questions before proceeding. If at any point in the process the 
patient has questions that he/she does not believe have been addressed adequately by [CONTACT_21118], the RA will page the PI, who will attempt to answer the patient’s question(s) more completely. If at any point in the process the participant indicates that he or she does not want to take part in the research study, the process will stop, 
and the RA will thank the patient for their time. After the RA signs the informed consent, s/he will offer to email 
the participant a copy. A second copy of the consent form  signed by [CONTACT_520581] a 
password protected, limited access shared file on the Northwestern FSM server.
 
 During study consent and initial enrollment, all participants also will be given information about the protections afforded by [CONTACT_520582]. A copy of the consent form 
signed by [CONTACT_520581] a passw ord protected, limited access shared file on the 
Northwestern FSM server.  
 
PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI AND HIPAA) 
The goal of the evaluation is to assess the reach/upt ake and effectiveness of specific new implementation 
strategies used to offer common health behavioral preventive services to “usual” patients under “usual” 
circumstances. Research procedures that introduce addition al participant risks or that selectively recruit only 
motivated volunteers into the evaluation activities would be disruptive of busy clinical workflows and would alter

HRP-593 / v121917 the findings of the evaluation in ways that are unpredictable and potentially misleading. For this reason, the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_520546] a pragmatic, “whole population” study using data collected routinely within the clinical IT systems. The pragmatic nature of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_520547] (Research Activity #3) of this evaluation 
dictates that it could not practicably be conducted without a HIPAA waiver. This HIPAA waiver applies to the intervention, control, and no intervention groups descri bed above under Research Activity #3. The protected 
health information necessary for the purposes of this ev aluation are those routinely collected through clinical 
care and not for the sole purposes of the research. As described above, the use of this PHI involves no more 
than a minimal risk to the privacy of participants and a detailed plan to protect participant identifiers from 
improper use and disclosure is in place, as well as wri tten assurances that the protected health information will 
not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research study, or for other research for which the use or disclosure of protected health information for 
which an authorization or opportunity to agree or object is not required.   
 For all other research activities (provider interviews; pati ent usability tests; patient semi-structured interviews), 
a HIPAA Authorization will be obtained from all participants. We are requesting the minimum necessary data available from the electronic health record that will be needed to identify potentially eligible patients who will be recruited for usability tests. Videotaped usability tests will then collect only the minimum necessary information 
needed to assess and improve the human-IT interaction. As we are only requesting data related to the 
preventive services being studied, we have made all reasonable efforts to limit the information to the minimum necessary to accomplish our intended purpose for the data set.

QUALIFICATIONS TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE 
Our research team is multi-disciplinary and experienced  in areas of health promotion, disease prevention, 
health communication, health behavior, and sustainable implementation of evidence-based programs and 
services to prevent and manage chronic condition s across primary care and community settings.  RONALD 
ACKERMANN  has [ADDRESS_675270] completed CITI training and good practice, such as in areas of the proper collection of informed consent, data collection and 
entry, and how to manage adverse events (both antic ipated and unanticipated) in the course of routine 
research.  
Because the proposed trial is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_346507], we have chosen a sample size needed to design the 
intervention to be implemented and sustained within routine practice workflows and to be usable to patients.  Primary care practices in the Northwestern Medical Group (NMG) central region deliver care to more about 183,[ADDRESS_675271] at the Galter Primary Care (GPC) site, 
which is relatively close to the medical campus and sees  a patient case mix that mirrors the larger NMG patient 
population. About 70% of GPC patients have used MyChart in the past year, and 32% of those (N=5,967) meet the study’s eligibility criteria. Thus, recruitment of the proposed sample will be feasible.

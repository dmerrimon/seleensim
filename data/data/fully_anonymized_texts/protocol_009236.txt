Study Design
This is a prospective randomized clinical study that involves studying  ketorolac  as an adjuvant pain 
medication for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament surgery patients. All patients enrolled in this study  
will receive the standard pain control  protocol before, during, and after surgery.  This includes a 1) a 
regional block during the pre-operative period,  2), IV Dexamethasone and IV Odansetron during surgery, 
and 3) analgesics (as directed by [CONTACT_101034]) in the PACU. Both groups will also receive the 
standard of care discharge pain medications for arthroscopic anterior cruciate  ligament surgery: 
oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-325 (1-2 tablets PO q4-6h PRN for moderate to severe pain #28 tabs). 
Patients will be randomized into one of two groups. Randomization  would be performed using  a pre-
defined computer-generated randomization sheet.  Patients will not be randomized into a group until 
they are in the preoperative holding area. Patients  will not be made aware of their randomization  until  
postoperative. Patients will also Group  [ADDRESS_849016] of 
care pain protocol  before, during, and after surgery but will also receive an intraoperative dose of IV 
ketorolac at the completion  of the procedure  and oral ketorolac  on discharge  (10mg  PO q6 x3 days). 
Patients in this group will also be given omeprazole (20 mg PO, once per day x3 days). Patients  will 
record their pain levels, oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-[ADDRESS_849017]-operative appointment. Participation in this study will not require 
any additional visits to the surgeon’s office  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_635450]- and post-operative 
appointments.

Approved: 01/2019 Prior Version: 10/[ADDRESS_849018]  been 
answered and the patient  demonstrates a full understanding of the investigation and their role in the 
study. The patient’s home medications will be reviewed,  and any potential  drug-drug interactions will be 
discussed with  the patient.     
2.  As part  of the standard of care, patients undergoing elective arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament 
surgery will undergo pre-operative testing to ensure  patients  are optimized for surgery from a medical  
perspective. During  the pre-operative testing period, the standard blood draw taken as part of the 
standard of care, utilizing no more of the patient’s time  or blood than  generally performed if the patient 
were not enrolled in the investigation. Before  surgery patients will fill out the following  patient  reported  
outcome metrics: Visual  Analogue Score (VAS),  Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome  Score  (KOOS), 
International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation,  and the Lysholm knee score. It is 
expected that it will take  the subject  about 5-[ADDRESS_849019] of care pain  protocol for arthroscopic  anterior cruciate ligament surgery,  which consists  of: 
1) IV Dexamethasone and IV Odansetron  during surgery, and 2) analgesics (as directed  by [CONTACT_322766]) in the PACU.  Both groups will also receive the standard  of care  discharge pain 
medications for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament surgery: oxycodone-acetaminophen  5-325 (1-2 
tablets PO q4-6h PRN  for moderate to severe  pain #28 tabs). Group [ADDRESS_849020] of care pain  protocol on the day of surgery and an intraoperative dose of IV ketorolac at the 
completion of surgery (dosing individualized  by [CONTACT_635460]).  The operating surgeon will be 
responsible for directing the anesthesiologist  to administer the IV Ketorolac. Group [ADDRESS_849021] of care discharge pain medications and scheduled oral ketorolac (10mg PO q6 x3 days). In 
addition, all Group  2 patients will receive a prescription for omeprazole (20 mg PO, once per day x3 days)  
to take for 3 days after surgery to decrease their risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_453159]. Patients in Group  1 
will not receive a prescription for omeprazole.  A 1:1 randomization ratio will be used (an equal number  
of patients  will be placed in each group). Patients will then undergo standard arthroscopic anterior 
cruciate ligament surgery with one of the surgical  investigators. Prior to discharge, all patients will be 
provided a handout on safely  using opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
4. Following discharge from the ambulatory surgery center, patients in Group  1 and Group 2 will be 
asked to document  their VAS pain  scores at 6 hour intervals (morning,  afternoon, and evening) for five 
days in a journal administered to them at the time of study  enrollment. They will also be asked to record 
the number  of oxycodone-acetaminophen  5-325 pi[INVESTIGATOR_635451]. 
At the end of each day,  patients will be asked  to document the following adverse effects: nausea, 
vomiting, somnolence,  dizziness,  headache, pain, pruritis,  other  in their journal.  All patients  in Group [ADDRESS_849022] the number  of ketorolac pi[INVESTIGATOR_453161].  
To ensure safety, all patients  assigned to Group 2 will receive a form outlining the common and serious 
side effects  of Ketorolac and specific  instructions for when they should call their doctor or go to the 
emergency room. All patients who receive anterior cruciate ligament surgery at UH are instructed to call 
their surgeon’s office if they feel their pain is not controlled at home after surgery.

knee, pain levels, strength and questioned regarding functionality of the operative knee.  In the setting of 
a complication (wound breakdown,  infection),  patient information will be recorded  and communicated 
using university password protected email to communicate with the primary  investigator. At the first two 
follow-up clinic appointment after  surgery, patients will fill out the following patient  reported outcome 
metrics: VAS, KOOS, IKDC, and Lysholm questionnaires. The first appointment is about 1-[ADDRESS_849024] received for their prescription for oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-

Study Timeline
Patients are evaluated in the orthopaedic investigators’  outpatient clinics for anterior cruciate ligament 
pathology. If a patient’s condition is amenable to arthroscopic surgery and they elect to undergo the 
procedure they will be approached  for participation in this study. This evaluation  and discussion  of the 
surgical procedure should take 10-15 minutes. The time for enrolling a patient should take 10 minutes  
with 5 minutes for patients’ questions. Therefore, an outpatient  visit for a patient enrolling  this study 
would take 25-[ADDRESS_849025]-op visit.

Approved: 01/2019 Prior Version: 10/[ADDRESS_849026]  will be utilized to compare  
the differences in mean VAS scores  and narcotics utilization between the two groups at each  time point. 
Linear regression models  will be utilized to identify  trends  over time. Descriptive analyses (e.g., 
percentages) will be used to report qualitative data as appropriate. 
The minimal clinically  important difference in VAS scores is [ADDRESS_849027] deviation in VAS scores 
of 13.3.  Using this data,  our power analysis showed that, with an alpha of 0.05  and 90% power,  we 
would need 34 patients, or 17 per group, to achieve adequate power.  However, to account  for a 20% 
dropout rate we will recruit  for 43 patients.  Power analysis was performed using G*Power [IP_ADDRESS].
The primary endpoint of this study  is VAS pain scores and number  of narcotic medications  consumed. 
Secondary scores  include,  KOOS, IKDC, Lysholm,  and PROMIS scores.
Drugs or Devices
Ketorolac is an FDA-approved  drug for pain relief. Omeprazole is an FDA-approved drug for the prevention 
and treatment of gastroesophageal  reflux disease (GERD).

Risks to  Research Participants
All patients scheduled for elective arthroscopic anterior cruciate  ligament  surgery undergo pre-operative 
testing to ensure they are medically optimized  for surgery. Patients  with contraindications to Ketorolac  
will not be enrolled  in the study:
Previous allergic reaction to Ketorolac
History of any of the following: peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, or perforation of 
the stomach  or bowel
Having experienced an asthma, urticarial,  or a allergic-type reactions  after  taking aspi[INVESTIGATOR_635455]
History of kidney disease or kidney failure
History of a brain bleed
History of a bleeding disorder
Currently taking the medication probenecid
Currently taking the medication pentoxifylline
The investigators will ensure  no patient with contraindications to Ketorolac are enrolled via the 
following: 1) the patient’s past medical  history in their electronic medical record and pre-operative 
history form will be evaluated for contraindications to ketorolac, and 2) the patient will be questioned  
prior to enrollment about having any of the conditions that are contraindications to Ketorolac using the 
patient enrollment  form created for this study (see “Other Documents” in Sparta submission). 
Common non-serious side effects of Ketorolac:
• Nausea, stomach  pain, indigestion, diarrhea
• Dizziness, drowsiness
• Headache
• Swelling
Serious side effects of Ketorolac:
• Gastrointestinal problems: ulcers,  bleeding, or peforation
• Hemorrhage
• Impaired renal function
• Impaired liver function
• Allergic or anaphylactoid reaction
• Anemia
• Ketorolac,  like other NSAIDs, may  cause serious cardiovascular side effects,  such as 
myocardial infarction or stroke, which may  result  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_635456], and will be given an informative  handout on ketorolac 
and its side effects (see “Other Documents” in Sparta submission).  This handout also has instructions for 
when patients should call their surgeon’s office or seek immediate medical  assistance. In addition, all 
patients enrolled in this study will receive a phone  call on Day 2 after  surgery to ensure they are filling 
HRP-
503BIOTEMPLATE: Biomedical Protocol
Approved: 01/2019 Prior Version: 10/[ADDRESS_849029]  of 
care postoperative  pain  regiment oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-325  (1-2 tabs PO q4-6h PRN moderate  to 
severe pain #28 tabs))
Arthroscopic repair is a well-established treatment option for patients with anterior cruciate ligament 
pathology. Therefore, if their surgeon  has recommended  they receive arthroscopic  repair, it will be 
because the surgeon  believes it is the best  treatment  option for their condition,  not for research 
purposes. If a patient elects to withdraw from the Ketorolac arm, they will simply  be asked to discontinue 
HRP-
503BIOTEMPLATE: Biomedical Protocol
Approved: 01/2019 Prior Version: 10/[ADDRESS_849030] of ketorolac and omeprazole for 
patients randomized into Group  2. As such, the patient’s  insurance company will be responsible for the 
cost of ketorolac and omeprazole. However,  ketorolac is a generic drug that is commonly  utilized both 
within and outside  of Orthopaedics. Patients will ultimately be responsible if the insurance company does 
not pay,  and for any associated co-pay. Paying for Ketorolac and Omeprazole will be discussed with the 
patient in clinic during the consent  process.
Research Participant  Compensation
There is no compensation for subjects.
Provisions to Monitor the  Data to Ensure the  Safety  of Research  Participants
Data collected from subjects participating in the study will be immediately protected  as each subject will 
be assigned a number that will in no way correspond to any pertinent data relating to the subject’s 
protected health information. Following collection  of data from questionnaires and pain  journals,  the 
orthopaedic resident will collect all documentation  and after being entered electronically behind RedCap 
software, will be placed  within  the locked file cabinets located within  the primary investigators office.  
Data will be accessed by [CONTACT_635463].  Data will be assessed for completeness, 
accuracy and per strict  adherence to the approved  protocol  by [CONTACT_635464]-
monthly (once per two months) meetings with  the investigative team who will be responsible  for data  
protection using  files on only protected hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406613]. In addition, monitoring of the data  by [CONTACT_635465]-monthly  meeting in which  the 
standards and rules of the protocol will be reviewed  to ensure that all regulations set forth in the 
confidentiality agreement  are met and complete. Recorded adverse/safety  events will be actively 
monitored by [CONTACT_635466], and reviewed  during the bi-monthly meetings. Any 
adverse/safety events identified through pain diaries  and post-op day [ADDRESS_849031]  copi[INVESTIGATOR_635457] a locked file cabinet located

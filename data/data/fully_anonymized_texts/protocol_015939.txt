22 March 2022  18 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1. Synopsis  
Rationale:  Neisseria  meningitidi s infec tions causing invasive meningococcal disease 
(IMD) are an important public health concern worldwide due to the substantial  morbidi ty 
and mortality they cause , as well as the transmissibili ty of these infec tions. Ninety 
percent of meningoc occal mening itis and septicaemia  are caused by [INVESTIGATOR_13701]  5 N. 
meningitidis  serogroups : A, B, C, W and Y.  
[COMPANY_004] is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a MenABCWY combination vaccine intended to protect 
against IMD caused by [CONTACT_21129] 5 meningococcal serogroups. 
The early clinical development plan consists of a seamless Phase I/II study. The first -
time-in-human (FTIH), Phase I part of this st udy will be conducted in healthy adults in a 
dose-escalating fashion with 2 formulations of the investigational  
 and will serve as a  
safety lead -in to the Phase II study.   
The Phase II part of the study  will be condu cted in 2 parts: The ‘formulation and 
schedule -finding ’ part will follow  in healthy adolescents and young adults and it is 
designed to select the vaccine formulation and the schedule to be tested in Phase III.  The 
‘blood sourcing’ part will be conducted in healthy adults in order to collect sufficient 
serum samples for the development of assays to be used in the vaccine 
clinical development program. Phase II will assess the safety, the effectiveness and the  
immunogenicity of the above 2 formulations of the investigational  
vaccine. Bexsero (rMenB+OMV  NZ, hereafter referred to as MenB) and Menveo  
(hereafter referred to as MenACWY) will be administered as control vaccines for 
assessing the response t o serogroups B and ACWY, respectively.  
Objectives and endpoints : Refer to  Table 11 for the study objectives and endpoints.  
1.2. Schema  
Refer to  Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 in Section 4.1, Overall design.

2.1. Study r ationale  
Neisseria meningitidis  infections causing invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) are an 
important public health concern worldwide due to the substantial morbidity and mortality 
they cause, as well as the transmissibility of these infections. Ninety percent of 
meningoc occal meningitis and septicaemia  are caused by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] 5 N. meningitidis  
serogroups: A, B, C, W and Y.  
[COMPANY_004]  has [ADDRESS_1284738] serogroups A, C, W, Y and B 
respectively, the quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine ( Menve o) and 
the multi -component recombinant meningococcal B vaccine ( Bexsero ). The availability 
of a pentavalent meningococcal vaccine in a single administration would however reduce 
the number of injections, allow greater flexibility in dose administration sch edules and 
increase the coverage for meningococcal disease caused by [CONTACT_914354].  
The drug component as well as the final pentavalent  
 have undergone pre -clinical  
testing in mice, rats and rabbits, to assess immunogenicity and breadth of MenB strain 
coverage, while a G LP toxicology study to assess local tolerability and systemic toxicity  
has been concluded . Results from the pre-clinical  testing and toxicology study were 
favourable.  Please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for information 
regarding the fo rmulation and pre-clinical studies of  vaccine.  
The early clinical development plan consists of a seamless Phase I/II study. The first -
time-in-human (FTIH), Phase I part of  this study will be conducted in healthy adults in a 
dose-escalating fash ion with 2 formulations of the investigational  
 referred to hereafter 
as  respectively,  and will serve as a safety lead -
in to the Phase II study p art.  
The Phase II part of the study will be conducted in 2 parts: the ‘formulation and schedule -
finding’ part will follow  in healthy adolescents and young adults and it is designed to 
select the vaccine formulation and the schedule to be tested in Phase III. The ‘blood 
sourcing’ part will be conducted in healthy adults in order to collect sufficient serum 
samples for the development of assays to be used in the  vaccine clinical 
development program. Phase II will assess the safety, the effectiveness and the 
immunogenicity of the above 2 formulations of the investigational

2.2. Background  
Neisseria meningitidis  is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and sepsis worldwide, 
capable of causing outbre aks and epi[INVESTIGATOR_479613].  N. meningitidi s 
infec tions causing IMD are an important public health concern worldwide due to the 
substantial morbidi ty and mortality they cause , as well as the transmissibili ty of these 
infec tions. In healthy individuals, IMD can rapi[INVESTIGATOR_914336], including  fatali ty in ~10% of cases. While 
the greatest IMD burden is in infants, there is a second peak of disease in adolescents and 
young adults. 
IMD occurs when the normally asymptomatically carried encapsulated  gram-negative 
bacterium N. meningitidi s enters  the bloodstream,  multiplies and causes sepsis. Once the 
blood -brain  barrier  is compromised, development of acute bacterial meningi tis represe nts

[Heckenberg , 2014].   
Ninety percent of meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia are caused by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] 5 N. 
meningitidis  serogroups: A, B, C, W and Y. The distribution of serogroups varies 
geographically and over time. While the disease burden of IMD in higher -income 
regions, such  as Europe and Australia, is largely attributable to serogroup B, in the 
‘meningitis belt’ of sub -Saharan Africa, IMD is predominantly caused by [CONTACT_167508] A 
and W. In the U nited States (US) , serogroups B, C and Y account for most IMD.  
The best option for  the control of meningococcal disease is the use of effective vaccines 
that would include all [ADDRESS_1284739] common serogroups responsible for invasive disease.  
With evidence of meningococcal epi[INVESTIGATOR_479615] [ Cohn , 2015; Halperin , 2012 ; Harrison , 2009 ], a vaccine with the broadest 
possible coverage is an important step toward a definitive and global solution for 
meningococcal disease prevention. Refer to Section 2.1 for details on [COMPANY_004]’ 
investigational  vaccine in development.  
[COMPANY_004]’s  Meningococcal Groups A, C, Y and W-135 Conjugate Vaccine ( Menveo ) is a 
meningococcal oligosaccharide  diphtheria CRM 197 conjugate vaccine licensed for active 
immunisation to prevent IMD caused by N. meningitidis  serogroups A, C, W, and Y. It  
contains a nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin ( Corynebacterium diphtheriae  Cross 
Reacting Materia l-197, CR M197) as the carrier protein and has been demonstrated to be  
highly  immunogenic against serogroups A , C, W and Y and is well tolerated in all age 
groups. It has been licensed in more than 60 countries ; many of these countries have also 
approved its use in childr en. In the EU, the vaccine is indicated for use in individuals 2 
years of age and older, and in the U S, in individuals 2 months to 55 years of age.  
The Meningococcal Group B Vaccine ( Bexsero ) contains 3 recombinant proteins [factor 
H binding protein (fHbp), Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), and Neisseria l Heparin Binding 
Antigen (NHBA)], combine d with Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMV) components from

majori ty of circula ting meningococca l serogroup B strains and has acceptable 
reactogenici ty and safety profiles when administered to individuals across age groups. 
The vaccine is currently approved in more than 40 countries worldwide.  Although the 
meningococcal group B vaccine was developed for individuals aged 2 months and older, 
the actual age range for which this recommendation extends varies depending on the 
approval from different health authorities.  
Please refer to the current I B for information regarding pre -clinical studies of 
 vaccine . 
2.3. Benefit/Risk a ssessment  
Detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and expected 
adverse events of  vaccine can be found in the  IB. 
Detailed informati on about the known and expected benefits and risks and expected 
adverse events of Bexsero (MenB ) and Menveo  (MenACWY)  vaccine can be found in the 
Prescribing Information or Summary of Product Characteristics.  
As with all injectable vaccines, immediate systemic allergic reactions to vaccination can 
occur. In order to be able to treat participants  with an immediate systemic allergic 
reaction to vaccination, all participants  will need to remain under close observa tion for at 
least 30 minutes after each study intervention  (as per the phase in which they are 
participating : Visit V1 and Visit V 3 in Phase I, Visit V1,  Visit V 3^ and Visit V4 in Phase 
II Formulation  and Schedule -Finding and Visit V1 and Visit V2 in Phase  II Sourcing). 
Refer to Section 6.1. 
^ except for Control group participants who will have a phone call at this time point (T C). 
In terms of study procedures, blood sampling is associated with a risk of syncope, 
dizziness, local reactions and infection after or during venepuncture. For this reason, 
blood samples in this study will be obtained by a trained professional and medical 
assistance will be available. The potential risk of feeling faint, experiencing mild local 
pain, bruising, irritation or redness at the site where blood was taken, is mentioned in the 
Informed Consent Form.  
Benefit considerations include:  
• Potential benefit of receiving the licensed Bexsero and Menveo  vaccines to help 
protect against meningococcal IMDs caused by N. meningitidis  serogroups A, B, C, 
W and Y.  
• Contributing to the process  of developi[INVESTIGATOR_914337]  N. meningiti dis. 
• Medical evaluations/assessments associated with this study (e.g., physical 
examinations).  
Overall Benefit: Risk conclusion  
Considering the measures taken to minimise risk to participants  participating in this study  
and s ince  vaccine is based on 2 of [COMPANY_004] ’s meningococcal vaccines ,

Protocol Amendment 4 Final  
22 March 2022  52 4.2. Scientific rationale for study design  
(Amended 22 March 2022)  
The investigational  vaccine is composed of  
 
 
 
 
As the investigational  vaccine  has never been administered to human s, 
the study will follow a stagger ed design with [ADDRESS_1284767] in a small group of healthy adults 18 through 40  years of age  (Phase I) , 
and subsequently  in a small group of healthy adolescents and young adults aged 10 
through 25 years prior to proceed ing with the full enrolment in Phase II . 
• The first part of the study [ Phase I  (Figure 1)] will serve as a safety lead -in to the 
Phase II part of the study.  
• The second part of the study [Phase II (Figure 2 and Figure 3] will only commence 
after demonstration of acceptable safety and reactogenic ity in Phase I participants  
(Section 4.1.1 ). This Phase II will have 2 components – the formulation and 
schedule -finding part  and the blood sourcing part. 
The 0,1 -month schedule was selected for Phase I and Phase II (Sourcing) because the 
short time interval between vaccinations is conservative for the assessment of 
reactogenicity and safety.   
Furthermore, the   vaccine will also be administered according to a 
0,2month or 0,6month interval (wider dosing schedules) in th e Phase II Sourcing part  
to support the finalization  of assay development, further clinical testing , as well as  
assay stability monitoring and maintenance . For this rea son, t he total sample size of 
subjects in the Phase II Sourcing have been increased . 
The formulation and schedule -finding  part of the Phase II is designed to assess safety, 
effectiveness and immunogenicity of  
 
. The 2 -
dose schedule, as well as the interval between doses are based on the dosing schedule 
approved for Bexsero  in adolescents and young adults.  
Menveo  and Bexsero  will be administered as comparators in Phase II, in line with the 
respective approved labels in this age group (  
 
 
 in Phase I/II . 
Rationale for use of placebo : 
The placebo treatment (saline solution) is included in this study as : 
• a control for safety assessments  (in Phase I ), and, 
• to maintain the blinding (in Phase I and Phase II , Formulation and Schedule -finding ).

22 March 2022  65 6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
The study intervention(s) must be stored in a s ecured place  within the temperature range 
specified on the study intervention’s label. The storage temperature should be 
continuously monitored and recorded with a calibrated (if not validated) temperature 
monitoring device(s).  
Only authorised study personnel should be allowed access to the study intervention(s). 
Storage conditions will be assessed by a sponsor study contact [CONTACT_227246] -study activities. 
Refer to the S PM for more details on storage and handling of the study intervention(s).  
6.3. Measures to  minimise bias: randomisation and blinding  
6.3.1.  Participant  identification  
Participant identification numbers will be assigned sequentially to the individuals who 
have consented to participate in the study. Each study centre will be allocated a range of 
partic ipant identification numbers.  
6.3.2.  Randomisation to study intervention  
There are 2 randomisation processes for each participant  in the study : 
• Randomisation to study intervention  
6.3.3.  Intervention allocation to the participant  
In Phase I  and Phase II (Sourcing) , the randomisation algorithm will use a minimisation 
procedure accounting for the study.   
In Phase II  (Formulation and Schedule -finding) , the minimisation procedure will account 
for age category (10 -17 years of age and 18 -25 years of age) and previous MenACWY 
vaccination (priming) (Yes and No) *. 
It is recommended to have a balance between age category during enrolment in Phase II 
(Formulation and Schedule -finding).  
Once a participant identification number is allocated, the randomisation system will 
determine study group and will provide the study intervention  number to be used for t he 
first dose. The study intervention number(s) to be used for subsequent dosing will be 
provided by [CONTACT_836589] -based system  (SBIR) . 
When  SBIR  is not available, please refer  to the SBIR  user guide or SPM for specific 
instructions.  
To allow  [COMPANY_004] to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment in this multi -centre study 
and to reduce the overall study recruitment period, an over -randomisation of supplies will 
be prepared.

6.3.4.  Allocation of participants to assay subsets  
Refer to Section 9 for details on the allocation as per the MenACWY priming and the 
analysis planned.  Blood samples will be collected as detailed in  Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Refer to 
Section 10.2.1  for details on allocation of participants for safety laboratory assays.  
Refer to Section 8.1.3  for details on allocation of participants to assay subsets  and Section

(Amended 22 March 2022)  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Phase I  and Phase II (Sourcing)  
(Amended 22 March 2022)  
Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. To do so, study intervention(s)  will 
be prepared and administered by [CONTACT_914360], evaluation, review or the entry of any study endpoint (i.e. reactogenicity, 
safety, efficacy).  
Note: Due to the different vaccination schedules in Phase II Sourcing, the study will be 
observer blind only in terms o f the vaccine formulations  
The laboratory in charge of sample testing will be blinded to the study intervention 
assignment. Codes will be used to link the participant and study to each sample. There 
will be no link between the study intervention and the identity of the participant.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Phase II (Formulation and Schedule -finding ) 
This phase is partially blinded. Data in the 4 ABCWY groups will be collected in an 
observer -blind manner. To do so, study intervention(s) will be prepared and administered 
by [CONTACT_914361], evaluation, 
review or the entry of any study endpoint (i.e. reactogenicity, safety, efficacy).  
Data in the Control group will be collected in an open -label manner i.e.  study 
participants, investigator  and site staff p ersonnel will be aware of the treatment 
administered  as [ADDRESS_1284775] number. Ther e will be no link between the study intervention groups and 
the identity of the participant. In addition, for each sample, a different randomly selected

[IP_ADDRESS].  Unblinding  
(Amended 22 March 2022)  
The participant, the site and sponsor personnel involved in the clinical  evaluation of 
the participants will be unblinded to the treatment assig ned at a Phase at completion of 
that particular  Phase.  
Refer to Section 4.4 for the definition of study completion per participant.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Emergency unblinding  
Unblinding a participant’s individual study intervention number should occur ONLY in 
case of a medical emergency wh en this information is essential for the clinical 
management or welfare of the participant.  
The emergency unblinding process enables the investigator to have unrestricted, 
immediate and direct access to the participant’s individual study intervention via  SBIR.   
The investigator may contact a [COMPANY_004] Helpdesk (refer to the Table 18) if he/she needs help 
to perform the unblinding process (i.e., if the investigator is unable to access the 
automated Internet -based system).  
A physician other than the investigator (e.g. an emergency room physician) or 
participant/care giver/family member may also request emergency unblindin g either via 
the investigator (preferred option) or via the [COMPANY_004] Helpdesk (back up option). The 
subject/ participant card provides contact [CONTACT_81578], his/her back up

Protocol Amendment 4 Final  
22 March 2022  68 [IP_ADDRESS].  Unblinding  prior to regulatory reporting of SAEs  
[COMPANY_004] policy requires unblinding of any unexpected SAE which is attributable/suspected 
to be attributable to the study intervention(s), prior to regulatory reporting. Vaccines 
Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (VCSP) is responsible for unblinding the stu dy 
intervention assignment within the timeframes defined for expedited reporting of SAEs 
(refer to the Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
In addition, [COMPANY_004] VCSP staff may unblind the intervention assignment for any participant 
with a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) or a SAE that is fatal 
or life -threatening. For SAEs requiring expedited reporting to 1 or more regulatory 
agencies, a copy of the repo rt containing participant’s intervention assignment may be 
sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or [COMPANY_004] policy.  
6.4. Study intervention compliance  
When the study intervention is administered at the site, participants will receive it dir ectly 
from the investigator or designee, under medical supervision. The date of administration 
of each study intervention dose in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents.  
6.5. Dose modification  
Not applicable.  
6.6. Continued access to study intervention after the end of the 
study  
(Amended 22 March 2022)  
During the study conclusion visit/contact  (Telephone T3 in Phase I, Visit V6 in Phase II, 
Formulation and Schedule -finding and Telephone T2 / Telephone T3  in Phase II, 
Sourcing  [as per group allocation] ), the investigator will ask each 
participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) if they are interested in participating/allowing 
the participant to join a booster study/long -term study. If a participant/participant’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s)  is/are not interested in joining the booster study/long -term study the 
reason for refusal will be documented, when available, in the participant’s eCRF.  
The investigator is encouraged to share the immunological assay results of non -
responders with the study participants/participan ts’ parent(s)/LAR(s).  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to determine the medical care of the non -
responder as per local/regional practices, such as re -vaccination.

(Amended 22 March 2022)  
At each study visit/contact, the investigator or his/her delegate should question the 
participant and/or the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) about all medications/products 
taken, and vaccinations received by [CONTACT_2299].  
The following concomitant medic ation(s)/product(s)/vaccine(s) must be recorded in the 
eCRF:  
• All concomitant medication associated with an adverse event, including 
vaccines/products, except vitamins and dietary supplements, administered after the 
first dose of study intervention ( Phase 1  and Phase II, Sourcing : Day 1 to Day 211 or 
Day 241 or Day 361 (as per the group allocation)  and Phase II , Formulation and 
Schedule -finding : Day 1 to Day 541 ). 
• Any concomitant vaccination administered in the period starting [ADDRESS_1284778] (Phase 1  and 
Phase II, Sourcing : -Day 14 to Day 211 or Day 241 or Day 361 (as per the group 
allocation) and Phase II , Formulation and Schedule -finding : Day -14 to Day 541).  
• All concomitant medication leading to discontinuation of the study intervention or 
elimination from the analysis, including products/vaccines . Refer to S ections 5.2.2  
and 9.3.1  for details.  
• All concomitant medication which may explain/cause/be used to treat SAE/ Adverse 
Event of Special Interest ( AESI ) including vaccines/products,  as defined in Sections 
8.3.1  and [IP_ADDRESS] . These must also be recorded in the Expedited Adverse Event 
Report.  
• The use of antipyretic and/or other medications to prevent (prophylactic use) and/or 
treat fever during the first 7 days aft er vaccination to be recorded in the eCRF.  
• The use of analgesics to prevent (prophylactic use) and/or treat pain during the first 7 
days after vaccination to be recorded in the eCRF.  
• Medications taken for prophylaxis are those intended to prevent the onset  of 
symptoms. Medications taken for treatment are intended to reduce or eliminate the 
presence of symptoms that are present. An anti -pyretic is considered to be 
prophylactic when it is given in the absence of fever and any other symptom, to 
prevent fever f rom occurring [Refer to Table 1, Table 3 and Table 5 for definition of 
fever ].  
• The use of antipyre tics and/or analgesic medica tions within [ADDRESS_1284779] be identified and the reason for their use (prophylaxis versus 
treatment) must be described in the source document and Conc omitant Medications 
eCRF.  
• The use of systemic an tibiotics within 3 days prior to blood sampling visi t is a reason 
to delay  blood sampling (see Section 5.5, Criteria for temporary De lay of 
Vaccina tion).

7. DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Discontinuation of study intervention  
‘Discontinuation’ of study intervention  refers to any participant who has not received all 
planned doses of study intervention. A participant who discontinued stu dy intervention  
may continue other study procedures (e.g. safety or immunogenicity), planned in the 
study protocol at the discretion of the investigator.  
The primary reason for premature discontinuation of the study intervention  will be 
documented on the eCRF as follows:  
• Adverse event requiring expedited reporting to [COMPANY_004]  
• Unsolicited non -serious adverse event  
• Solicited adverse event  
• Not willing to be vaccinated  
• Other (specify).  
7.1.1.  Contraindications to subsequent study intervention(s) 
administration  
The eligib ility for subsequent study intervention administration must be confirmed before 
administering any additional dose.  
Participants who meet any of the criteria listed below or criteria listed in sections 5.2.1  
and 5.2.2  should not receive additional doses of study intervention. Such participants  
should be encouraged to continue other study procedures, at the investigators’ discretion 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). All relevant criteria for discontinuation  of study intervention 
administration must be recorded in the eCRF.  
• Any occurrence of an event listed in the exclusion criteria which must be always re - 
assessed by [CONTACT_914362].  
• Anaphylaxis following the administration of study intervention(s).  
• Participants who experience any SAE judged to be possibly or probably related to 
study intervention or non -study concomitant vaccine/product, including 
hypersensitivity reactions.  
• Participants who deve lop any new condition which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], may pose additional risk to the participant if he/she continues to 
participate in the study.  
• Any condition that in the judgement of the investigator would make intramuscular 
injection unsafe.  
CCI
CONFIDENTIAL  
212458 (MENACWY= -001 PRI)  
Protocol Amendment 4 Final  
22 March 2022  71 • Occurrence of a new A ESI or the exacerbation of an existing AESI that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], exposes the participant to unacceptable risk from 
subsequent doses of study intervention. Refer to Section 10.3.5  for the definition of 
AESIs.  
• Pregnancy (See Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
7.2. Participant discontinuation/withdrawal from the study  
A participant is considered to have withdrawn from the study if no new study procedure 
has been performed or no new information has been collected for him/her since the date 
of withdrawal/last contact.  
From an anal ysis perspective, a study ‘withdrawal’ refers to any participant who did not 
return for the concluding visit/was not available for the concluding contact [CONTACT_914363].  
Investigators will attempt to contact [CONTACT_914364] -up. 
All data and samples collected up to and including the date of withdrawal of/last contact 
[CONTACT_103707].  Refer to Table 1, Table [ADDRESS_1284780] below . The investigator will document whether the decision to withdraw a participant  
from the study was made by [CONTACT_310596]/herself, by [CONTACT_2299]’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s), or by [CONTACT_093], as well as which of the following possible 
reasons was responsible for withdrawal : 
• Adverse events requiring expedited  reporting to [COMPANY_004] (Refer  to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for 
the details ) 
• Unsolicited non -serious adverse events  
• Solicited adverse event  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_3445], not due to an adverse event*  
• Migrated/Moved from the study area  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Sponsor study termination  
• Other (specify)  
*If a participant is withdrawn from the study because he/she/the participant’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) has withdrawn consent and the reason for withdrawal was provided, the 
investigator must document this reason in the eCRF.  
Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs/SAEs /AESIs/ pregnancy  
must be clearly distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. 
Investigator will follow participants who are withdrawn from the study due to an 
AE/SAE /AESI/ pregnancy until the event is resolved (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
CCI
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol Amendment 4 Final  
22 March 2022  72 A participant  will be withdrawn if the participant ’s treatment code is unblinded by [CONTACT_253787] (Refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). The primary reason for 
discontinuation (the event or condition which led to the unblinding) will be recorded in 
the eCRF.  
7.3. Lost to follow -up 
A participant will be considered ‘lost to follow -up’ if he/she fails to return for scheduled 
visits and cannot be contact[CONTACT_9298].  
Please refer to the SPM for a description of actions to be taken before considering the 
participant lost to follow -up. 
Study conclusion call/visit and discontinuation of individual sites or of the study as a 
whole is described in Section 10.1.9 . 
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
Protoc ol waivers or exemptions are only permitted when necessary for the management 
of immediate safety concerns for the participant.  
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor as soon as they occur or 
when the study team becomes aware of th em. The purpose of this communication is to 
determine if the participant(s) should discontinue the study intervention.  
Study procedures and their timing are summarised in the SoA (Section 1.3).  
All screening evaluations must be completed and the results reviewed before confirming 
that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. Refer to Sections [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS]  
for details on screening evaluations in this study. Note: The safety laboratory evaluations 
in Phas e I are not part of the screening evaluation  in this study . 
The investigator will maintain a log of all participants screened. All relevant information, 
such as confirmation of eligibility and reasons for screening failure will be mentioned in 
this screening log.  
Procedures conducted as part of routine clinical management (e.g. h aematologic  profiles), 
and obtained before the participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) signed the Informed 
Consent Form (ICF), may be used for screening and/or for establi shing a clinical baseline 
(provided the procedure met protocol  specified criteria and was performed within the 
time frame defined in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
The SPM provides the investigator and site personnel with detailed administrative and 
technical information that does not impact participant safety.  
Decentralised study procedures  (Phase II only) : 
If local regulations allow and quality of study proce dures is maintained, participant(s) can 
be offered remote visits (e.g. telemedicine, home visits)  for the collection of biological 
samples and/or safety data/safety assessment(s)/study intervention administration. These 
remote visits must be performed by q ualified study staff/healthcare professionals HCPs. 
CCI

Protocol Amendment 4 Final  
22 March 2022  73 Refer to the Schedule of Activities for the timing of these visits. Details of how these 
visits will be conducted are outlined in the SPM.  
Following  procedures can be performed remotely/ virtually  (with the exception of Visit 1 
which is always a clinic visit) . Refer to the Glossary of terms  for definitions of 
telemedicine, remote and virtual visits:  
• Safety follow -up may be performed by [CONTACT_31863], phone calls, and a web portal and/or mobile application as a way of 
communicating with the participant and monitoring the participant’s progress. In 
addition, qualified stu dy staff/HCPs may also identify AEs and report them to the 
investigator for evaluation.  
• Biological samples may be collected remotely by [CONTACT_114007]/HCPs . 
Biological samples should be collected only if they can be processed in a timely 
manner and appropriately stored until the intended use.  
• Administration of study intervention can be performed remotely/at participant’s 
home by [CONTACT_114007]/HCPs if appropriate storage conditions for the study 
intervention can be ensured. Furthermore, appropriate medical treatment must be 
readily available during 30 minutes after dosing in case of anaphylaxis, syncope.  
Study procedures in special circumstances:  
(Amend ed 22 March 2022)  
During special circumstances (e.g., COVID -19 pandemic), the specific guidance from 
local public health and other competent authorities regarding the protection of 
individuals’ welfare must be applied. For the duration of such special circumstances, the 
following measures may be implemented for enrolled participants:  
• If the eDiary device was provided to the participant, it may be returned to the site by 
[CONTACT_31870] (Visit 4 for 
Phase I , Visit 5 for Phase II , Formulation and Schedule -finding  and Visit 3 for Phase 
II, Sourcing ).  
• Biological samples may be collected at a different location* other than the study site 
or at participant’s home . Biological samples should not be collecte d if they cannot be 
processed in a timely manner or appropriately stored until the intended use.  
• Phase II only  (not applicable for Visit V1): Study visits may be performed at a 
different location* other than the study site (e.g. at participant ’s home). Fo r study 
visits involving blood draw, biological samples should not be collected if they cannot 
be processed in a timely manner or appropriately stored until the intended use.  
• If despi[INVESTIGATOR_914338] -defined  in the protocol (see  Table 2 for Phase I , Table 4 for Phase II, 
Formulation and Schedule -finding and  Table 8, Table 9 and Table 10 for Phase II,

22 March 2022  77 Note: the total number of participants (healthy adults) planned to be enrolled in the Phase 
I and Phase II (Sourcing) is required in order to collect sufficient serum samples for the 
development of assays to be used in the  vaccine clinical development  
program. All participants will be followed for safety up to [ADDRESS_1284783] 
vaccination.  
Phase II  (formulation and schedule -finding) : In order to provide the necessary serum 
volume for the bactericidal assays (enc -hSBA and/ or hSBA), a n overall bl ood volume of 
approximately 90mL , per participant,  will be collected over the course of the Phase II 
step of the study.  Please refer to Table 27 for details.

^ Blood sample will be used only for assessment of tertiary objectives  
Note: in case of local re gulations limiting the amount of blood to be taken in the younger population (e.g 10 -12 years of 
age and/or at the lower bound of the percentile of the growth chart), a reduced amount of blood volume could be drawn 
at Phase II, Visit [ADDRESS_1284784] 25m L of blood volume, 
samples will be analysed according to priority ranking provided in Table 29 and Table 30. 
Refer to Table 3 (SoA for Phase II , Formulation and Schedule -finding ) for details of visits . 
Insufficient blood volume may lead to test cancellation and jeopardise the statistical 
power. Hence, every effort must be done to collect blood volume as per protocol 
requirements . 
Note  1: Blood samples are taken from all participants  in Phase I and II irrespective of the 
testing status to maintain the blind of the study. Refer to Section 8.1 for details on how the 
unused/ left -over samples will be used.  
Note 2: Chec k criteria for blood draw delay as specified in Section 5.5. A topi[INVESTIGATOR_914339] (e.g. EMLA adhesives or cream) may be used at the site of blood sample 
draw, according to local practice in order to minimise  pain.

22 March 2022  83 Prior to study enrolment, demographic data will be collected fr om the participant , 
including date of birth ( Phase I  and Phase II (Sourcing) : year; Phase II  (Formulation and 
Schedule -finding) : month and year ), gender, race, ethnicity, weight, and heigh t, and 
recorded in the participant ’s eCRF.  
For Phase II (Formulation and Schedule -finding)  only: At Visit V1  in the Control 
group , the participant receives 2 in jections, one in either arm. Therefore, in order to 
associate  the solicited events reported to the vaccine administered in that arm , the 
dominant arm (left or right) will be recorded in the eCRF  (Table 16). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Medical/vaccination history  
Obtain the participant’s medical/vaccination history by [CONTACT_163549]/parent(s)/LAR(s) and/or review of the participant’s medical records. Record 
any pre -existing conditions, signs and/or symptoms present prior to the first dose of study 
intervention in the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  General and symptom -directed physical examination  
A general physical examination is to be performed by a qualified healthcare practitioner.  
“Qualified health care practitioner” refers to any licensed  or certified heal thcare 
professi onal who is permitted by [CONTACT_914366] -required 
procedures , and who  is identified within the Delegation of Responsibility Log . The 
physical examination will include examination of organ systems that are relevant to the 
investigator based on medical history and review of systems and a measurement of heart 
rate, blood pressure, and temperature.  
These data will be written in the s ource document. Should the physical assessment reveal 
any abnormal values or events, these must be documented in the eCRF Adverse Events 
Form.  
Physical examination at each study visit subsequent to the first study intervention  visit, 
will be performed only  if the participant / participant ’s parent(s)/LAR(s) indicates during 
questioning that there might be some underlying pathology(ies) or if deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_113118].  
If the investigator determines that the participant ’s health on the  day of vaccination 
temporarily precludes vaccination, the visit will be rescheduled. Treatment of any 
abnormality observed during this examination should be performed according to local 
medical practice outside this study or by [CONTACT_479686].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy test  
Female participants of childbearing potential must perform a urine pregnancy test before 
the administration of any dose of study intervention. Pregnancy testing must be done 
even if the participant is menstruating at th e time of the study visit. The study 
intervention may only be administered if the pregnancy test is negative.

22 March 2022  85 The following step -wise approach will be followed for the safety evaluation during the 
Phase I Safety Lead -in: 
• Step 1: Following the first vaccination  in  (12 participants) and 
4 participants) group s, all available safety data from all participants 
collected up to Day [ADDRESS_1284790] “go -no go” decision based on unblinded data. If a “go” decision 
is made, the enrolment in groups  will start and the 
administration of the second vaccination will take place in groups  
.  
• Step 2: Following the first vaccination  in  (12 participants) and 
 (4 participants) groups , all available safety data from all participants  
collected up to Day 8 will be evaluated by [CONTACT_163538]. The iSRC will be responsible 
for making the second “go -no go” decision based on unblinded data. If a “go” 
decision is ma de, the administration of the second vaccination will take place for 
participants in groups .  
• Step 3: Following the second vaccination  in  groups at 
Day 31, all available safety data  from all participants  collected up to Day [ADDRESS_1284791] “go -no 
go” decision based on unblinded data. If a “go” decision is made, the Phase II 
enrolment will start  parallelly  for the 2 parts: Phase II (sourcing) a nd Phase II 
(formulation and schedule -finding) . 
For Phase II, Formulation and Schedule -finding part of the study, a staggered enrolment 
of healthy volunteers will be performed, as described in Figure 5, for the iSRC safety 
evaluation of the first 45 enrolled  partici pants (Phase II safety lead -in).

and is a telephone call for Control group (T C) 
Note: This is a simplified study design aimed to show the safety review in Phase II (Formulation and Schedule -finding). 
To see the detailed study design, refer to Figure 2 (*) 
The following step -wise approach will be followed for the safety evaluation during the 
Phase II (Formulation and Schedule -finding):  
• A total of 45 participants will be randomi sed with 3:1:3:1:1 ratio to the 5 groups (15 
in the , 5 in the , 15 in the , 5 in the 
 and 5 in the Control group). A “go -no go” decision will be taken by 
[CONTACT_914367] 8 from these 
participants (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
• If the decision is “go”, the enrolment in all groups will continue with a 
randomi sation ratio of 1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_1284793] in the 40 
participants in  
 groups (as per study design) .  
Unblinded safety data to be reviewed by [CONTACT_914368]  
(only for Phase I) , solicited administration site and systemic post -vaccination events, 
unsolicited AEs, AESIs, and SAEs. Additional safety data may be reviewed and 
monitored by [CONTACT_914369].  
Continuous monitoring during the study by [CONTACT_914370] -hoc iSRC 
reviews and/or enrolment hold if any safety concern is identified or a substantial trend 
emerges outside of the scheduled unblinded safety reviews. Holding rules will be 
introduced to ensure a well -controlled exposure to the investigational candidate vaccine 
and to prevent participants from being exposed to any unnecessary safety risks (refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Outcome of safety evaluation  
If no safety signal is observed  during the iSRC reviews , the favourable outcome of the 
safety evaluations will be documented and provided in a written way, authorising the 
investiga tor to start the administration of the subsequent dose of study intervention to 
participants, as well as enrolment and study intervention administration to the remaining 
participants in the next step of the study.  
If a safety signal is observed during the safety evaluations or if any of the holding rules 
2a-c is met ( Table 32), the iSRC Chair (or his/her representative) is responsible for the 
urgent communication within  [COMPANY_004], including the rationale for the decision to put the 
study intervention administration on hold or not . Details about the procedures to be 
followed in case of safety signal or if a holding rule 2 (a -c) is met will be documented in 
the iSRC Charter.

22 March 2022  87 The Clinical Research & Development Lead ( CRDL ) who is the primary study contact 
[CONTACT_914371]. All site staff will be informed about th e final decision 
whether to suspend, modify or continue the conduct of the study on all groups or on 
selected groups  by [CONTACT_301916] . 
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Study holding rules  
Holding rules are defined to ensure well -controlled exposure to the investigational 
product and they  will apply to study participants in the Phase I Safety Lead-in and to the 
first 45 study part icipants  enrolled in the formulation and schedule -finding Phase II part . 
The holding rules will hence serve as criteria to point attention to safety signals and 
require escalation within [COMPANY_004], in order to decide whether other participants can be 
exposed. However, medical judg ement  considering all available safety data at the time of 
safety review should be the basis for decision to continue the study or not at each step.  
The safety holding rules are defined in the Table 32 (Phase I) and Table 33 (Phase II, 
Formulation and Schedule -finding) . If the investigator becomes aw are of holding rule 1a -
d being met  (for Phase I) and holding rule 1a  (for Phase II , Formulation and Schedule -
finding  during  the safety lead -in step ), he/she will suspend administering the study 
intervention and will inform [COMPANY_004] immediately (e.g. in case of death or any life -
threatening SAEs).  
Holding rules 2a -c will be assessed by [CONTACT_914372].  
These holding rules have been written under the assumption that the safety data from all 
participants will be available. If the data from all participants are not available (i.e. in 
case a participant is lost to follow -up), then  the holding  rules will be assessed on a pro -
rata basis.  
Of note, no formal holding rules will be applied for other safety data such as missed visits  
due to study intervention related AEs, Grade 1 and Grade 2 solicited and unsolicited AEs 
in the 7 -day follow -up period and unsolicited AEs collected from Day 8 to Day 30 after 
study intervention administration. However, if available, these data will also be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_163554]/risk ratio of study intervention 
administration.  
The iSRC can also meet ad -hoc during the entire safety lead -in phase  (Phase I) .

8.3.2.  Method of detecting AEs and SAEs, pregnancies and other 
events  
Detection and recording of AE/SAE/AESI/pregnancies are detailed in Section 10.3.8 .  
Assessment of AE/SAE intensity, causality and outcome are described  in Section 10.3.9 .  
Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of particip ants/participants’ 
parent(s)/LAR(s) is the preferred method of acquiring information related to an 
AE/SAE/AESI/pregnancy . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings  (Phase I)  
The investigator must review the laboratory report, document that he/she  did so, and 
record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the 
eCRF. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not 
associated with an underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_914377] ’s condition.  
• All clinically significant abnormal laboratory test values reported  for participants in 
Phase I  at Visit V1 and Visit V2  should be repeated until the values return to 
normal/baseline, or u ntil they are no longer considered significantly abnormal by [CONTACT_914378]. Refer to the Section 10.3.6  for more information on clinically 
abnormal laboratory assessments that qualify as an AE or SAE.  
• If such values do not return to normal/baseline after an interval judged reasonable by 
[CONTACT_093], the aetiology of the abnormal value should be identified and the 
sponsor notified.  
8.3.3.  Regulato ry reporting requirements for SAEs, pregnancies and 
other events  
Once an investigator (or designee) becomes aware that a study participant has 
experienced an SAE/AESI/pregnancy, it must be reported to [COMPANY_004] using the required 
documentation and within the ti meframes mentioned in Table 39. This is essential for 
meeting [COMPANY_004] legal obligations and ethical responsibilities f or participant safety and the 
safety of a study intervention  under clinical investigation.  
For SAEs/AESIs, the investigator must always provide an assessment of causality at the 
time of the initial report, as defined in the Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy for preparation of an investigator 
safety report of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) must be  
followed. These reports will be forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
The sponsor has the legal responsibility to notify local authorities/regulatory agencies

8.3.5.  Participant card  
The inve stigator (or designee) must provide the participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) 
with a “participant card” containing information about the clinical study. The 
participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) must be instructed to always keep the 
participant c ard in his/her/their possession for the duration of the study. In an emergency, 
this card serves to inform the responsible attending physician/LAR/family member that 
the participant is in a clinical study and that relevant information may be obtained by

8.3.6.  Medical device deficiencies  
The study interventions ( , Bexsero  and placebo ) are combination products 
constituted of a device and biologic product (e.g., pre -filled syringes). Refer to Glossary 
of terms  for the definition of a combination product and a medical device deficiency.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Detection, follow -up and prompt reporting of medical device deficiency  
The investigator is responsible for the detection, documentation and prompt reporting of 
any medical device deficiency occurring during the study to [COMPANY_004]. This applies to any 
medical device provided for the conduct of the study.   
Device deficienc ies will be reported to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours after the investigator 
determines that the event meets the protocol definition of a device deficiency. Refer to 
Section 10.7 for definitions and details on recording and reporting of these events.  
The investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any additional investigations to 
elucidate the nature and/or related of the device deficiency to the incident.  Follow -up 
applies to all participants, including those who discontinue study intervention or the 
study.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed form with all 
changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_479697] 24 hours.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Regulatory reporting of medical device deficiency when used as 
combination product  
The investigator will promptly report all device deficiencies occurring with any medical 
device provided for use in the study to [COMPANY_004]. [COMPANY_004] has a legal respo nsibility to notify 
appropriate regulatory authorities and other entities about safety information linked to 
medical devices being used in clinical studies. Refer to section   10.7.3  for details of 
reporting.  
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements (e.g. the head of 
the medical institution), will comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements 
relating to the reporting of device deficiencies to the IRB/IEC.

The key design elements of t his protocol and results summaries will be posted on 
www.ClinicalTrials.gov and/or [COMPANY_004] Clinical Study Register in compliance with 
applicable regulations/[COMPANY_004] policy. [COMPANY_004] will aim to register protocols summaries prior to 
study start and target results summar ies submission within 12 months of primary/ study 
completion date. Where external regulations require earlier disclosure, [COMPANY_004] will follow 
those timelines.  
Where required by [CONTACT_5151], summaries will also be posted on applicable national or 
regional clini cal trial registers.  
Where required by [CONTACT_25435], an investigator signatory will be 
identified for the approval of the study report, and provided reasonable access to 
statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports. [COMPANY_004] will also  provide the investigator 
with the full summary of the study results. The investigator is encouraged to share the 
summary results with the study participants, as appropriate.  
[COMPANY_004] will provide the investigator with the randomisation codes for their site onl y after 
completion of the full statistical analysis.  
[COMPANY_004] intends to make anonymised patient -level data from this trial available to external 
researchers for scientific analyses or to conduct further research that can help advance 
medical science or improve  patient care. This helps ensure the data provided by [CONTACT_227266].  
10.1.7.  Data quality assurance  
The investigator should maintain a record of the location(s) of their respective esse ntial 
documents, including source documents  (see Glossary of terms  for the exact definition of 
essential and source documents ). The document storage system used during the trial and 
for archiving (irrespective of the type of media used) should provide for document 
identification, version history, search, and retrieval.  
Essential trial documents may be added or removed where justified (in advance of trial 
initiation) based on their importance and relevance to the trial. When a copy is used to 
replace an ori ginal document (e.g. source documents, CRF), the copy should fulfil the 
requirements for certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (see Glossary of terms  for the exact def inition of 
certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ).  
All participant data related to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF 
unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (e.g. laboratory data). The 
investigator is responsible for verifying that d ata entries are accurate and correct by 
[CONTACT_46388].  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate source documents and trial records 
that include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s trial participants (see Glossary

copi[INVESTIGATOR_448832].  
The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this st udy including 
quality checking of the source data (see Glossary of terms  for the exact definition of 
source data ).  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered 
in the eCRF by [CONTACT_914380], legible, contemporaneous, 
original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data must be traceable, not o bscure 
the original entry, and be fully explained if necessary (e.g. via an audit trail). The safety 
and rights of participants must be protected, and the study conducted in accordance with 
the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, IC H GCP, and all 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
Quality tolerance limits (QTLs) will be pre -defined in the  Statistical analysis plan  to 
identify systematic issues that can impact participant safety and/or the reliability of study 
results. These pre -defined parameters will be monitored during the study.  Important 
deviations from the QTLs and remedial actions taken will be summarised in the Clinical 
Study Report  (CSR) . 
Trial records and source documents pertaining to the conduct of this study, including 
signed ICFs, must be retained by [CONTACT_1732] 25 years from issuance of the final 
CSR/equivalent summary  unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer 
retention period. No records may be destroyed during the retention period wi thout the 
written approval of the sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or 
party without written notification to the sponsor.  
10.1.8.  Source documents  
Source documents provide evidence to establish the existence of the participant and 
substan tiate the integrity of collected data. The investigator should maintain a record of 
the location(s) of their source documents.  
Data transcribed into the eCRF  from source documents must be consistent with those 
source documents; any discrepancies must be e xplained. The investigator may need to 
request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. Also, 
current medical records must be available.

[COMPANY_004] or its designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at its sole discretion, provided there is sufficient notice given to 
account for all participants safe exit from study.  
Regular closure of stu dy sites will occur upon study completion. A study site is 
considered closed when all required data/documents and study supplies have been 
collected and a study site closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study site closure at any  time, provided there is reasonable 
cause and enough notice in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_103086]:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor ’s procedures, or GCP guidelines  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_093]  
• Discontinuation of further study intervention development .

22 March 2022  121 10.3.  Appendix 3: Adverse Events: definitions and procedures for 
recording, evaluating, follow -up, and reporting Definition of 
AE 
10.3.1.  Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence (an unfavourable/unintended sign – including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) in a clinical 
study particip ant that is temporally associated with the study intervention. The AE may or 
may not be considered related to the study intervention.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Events Meeting the AE Definition  
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under s tudy.  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after administration of the study 
intervention even though they may hav e been present before study start.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug, disease or other 
interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either the 
study intervention or a concurrent medication.  
• Signs or symptoms temporally associated with administration of the study 
intervention.  
• Signs, symptoms that require medical attention (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], physician visits 
and emergency room visits).  
• Significant failure of an expected pharmacologic or biol ogical action.  
• Pre- or post - intervention events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated 
procedures (i.e. invasive procedures, modification of participant’s previous 
therapeutic regimen).  
• Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abn ormal assessments 
that are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the start of the study 
will also be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
• AEs to be recorded as solicited AEs are described in the Section 10.3.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLICITED AEs.  
CCI
CONFIDENTIAL  
212458 (MENACWY= -001 PRI)  
Protocol Amendment 4 Final  
22 March 2022  122 [IP_ADDRESS].  Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or 
convenience admi ssion to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admission for routine examination).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms pres ent in a participant before 
the first dose of study intervention. These events will be recorded in the medical 
history section of the eCRF.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31782] a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed before signing the informed consent) that did not worsen from baseline.  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_914381]’s condition.  
10.3.2.  Definition of an SAE 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
Note: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer 
to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more 
severe.  
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_914340]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_914341]/or treatment that would not 
have been appropriate in the physician’s office or in an out -patient setting. 
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_914342]. The 
event will also be considered serious if a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_914343]. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]’ 
occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
d. Results in di sability/incapacity  
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated 
head ache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental 
trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions 
but do not constitute a substantial disruption . 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study participant  
CCI

Protocol Amendment 4 Final  
22 March 2022  123 f. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, f oetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) . 
g. Other situations  
Medical or scientific judgement must be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations. Important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_914344]. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers; intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias; and 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] .

[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Arthritis  
Cases of arthritis are defined according to the following ad -hoc definition:  
• Presence of a physical exam findings of swelling, redness, heat, or limitation in 
range of motion and/or  
• Presence of a diagnostic imaging studies interpreted by a health care provider as 
demonstrating evidence of joint inflammation and/or arthrocentesis results 
evidencing inflammation.  
Due to the heterogeneity of the presentation of arthritis which can be either acute or 
chronic, the threshold of duration of [ADDRESS_1284812] of PTs corresponding to the diagnosis of arthritis, are those included in the 
MedDRA SMQ Narrow “Arthritis”. For any new diagnosis of arthritis (serious or non -
serious) in a study participant , the investigator (or designate) must complete, an 
electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report and an ad -hoc eCRF page on arthritis to 
further characterise this AESI.  
When there is enough evidence to make any of the above diagnoses, the AE must be 
reported as AESI. Symptoms, signs or conditions  which might (or might not) lead to one 
of the above diagnoses, should be recorded and reported as AEs but not as AESI until the 
final or definitive diagnosis has been made, and alternative diagnoses eliminated or 
shown to be less likely.  
10.3.6.  Clinical laborat ory parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualifying as AEs or SAEs   
In the absence of a diagnosis, abnormal laboratory findings assessments or other 
abnormal results the investigator considers clinically significant will be recorded as an 
AE or SAE, i f they meet the definition of an AE or SAE (refer to the Sections 10.3.1  and 
10.3.2 ).  
The investigator must exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding, or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant.

22 March 2022  128 While pre gnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any abnormal pregnancy 
outcome or complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will 
be recorded and reported as an SAE. Please refer to the Section 10.3.2  for definition of 
SAE.  
10.3.8.  Recording and follow -up of AEs, SAEs, AESIs and pregnancies  
(Amended 22 March 2022)  
The participants/participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_914384].  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the investigator’s responsibility to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE 
on the eCRF. The investigator may not send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’ s medical 
records to [COMPANY_004] instead of appropriately completing the eCRF.  
There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_333204]. In this case, all participant identifiers will be blinded on copi[INVESTIGATOR_914345].  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event, based on 
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE instead of individual signs/symptoms.  
An Electronic Diary (eDiary), hereafter referred to as Participant Diary, will be used in 
this study to capture solicited administration site or systemic events. The participant 
should be trained on how and when to complete the Participant Diary.  
Anyone who measures administration site or systemic events and who will record the 
event in the Participant Diary should be trained on using the Diary. This training must be 
documented in the participant’s source record. If any individual other than  the 
participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) is making entries in the Participant Diary, their 
identity must be documented in the Participant Diary/participant’s source record . 
Note  (Phase II , Formulation and Schedule -finding  part only) : eDiaries  may be  filled in by 
a minor participant under the supervision of the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) provided 
the minor is capable of assessing and reporting the information to be recorded on the 
eDiary . The ultimate accountability for completion of the eDiary  remains with the 
participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s). The investigator should discuss this accountability with 
the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s).

3 : ≥ 40.0°C ( 104.0°F)   
The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study. The asse ssment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.  
The intensity should be assigned to 1 of the following categories:  
1 (mild)  = An AE which is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing 
minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday ac tivities.  
2 (moderate)  = An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal everyday activities.  
3 (severe)  = An AE which prevents normal, everyday activities  
(in a young child, such an AE would, for example, prevent 
attendance at school  /a day -care centre and would cause the 
parent(s)/LAR(s) to seek medical advice. In adults/adolescents,

22 March 2022  133 such an AE would, for example, prevent attendance at 
work/school and would necessitate the administration of corrective 
therapy.)  
An AE that is assesse d as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with an SAE. Grade 3 
is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets 1 of the pre -defined 
outcomes as des cribed in the Section 10.3.2 .

All solicited administration site  and systemic events will be considered causally related to 
administration of the study intervention. The complete list of these event s is provided in 
Table [ADDRESS_1284817] assess the relationship between study intervention and the 
occurrence of each unsolicited AE/SAE using clinical judgement. Where several different 
interventions were administered, the investigator should specify, when possible, if the 
unsolic ited AE/SAE could be causally related to a specific intervention. When a causal 
relationship to a specific study intervention cannot be determined, the investigator should 
indicate the unsolicited AE/SAE to be related to all interventions.  
Alternative poss ible causes, such as the natural history of underlying disease, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study intervention will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult 
the IB and /or SmPC and/or Prescribing Information for marketed products to assist in 
making his/her assessment.  
Causality should be assessed by [CONTACT_163586]:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the unsolicited AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_5562]?  
YES  : There is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention  contributed 
to the AE.  
NO : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the 
administration of the study intervention. There are other, more likely 
causes and administration of the study intervention is not suspected to 
have contributed to the AE.  
If an event meets the criteria to be determined ‘serious’ (see Section 10.3.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed by [CONTACT_227274].  
Possible contributing factors include:  
• Medical history.

(Amended 22 March 2022)  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Woman of Childbearing Potential  (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menar che and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below).  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Women not considered as women of childbearing potential  
• Premenarchal  
Menarche is the first onset of menses in a young female. Menarche is normally 
preceded by [CONTACT_330548].  
Additional evaluation should be considered if a participant’s fertility status is unclear 
(e.g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study intervention.  
• Premenopausal  female with ONE of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
− Current bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
A postme nopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception o r hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 
months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use a 
non-hormonal, highly effective contraceptio n method if they wish to continue their 
HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation 
of postmenopausal status before study enrolment .

Vasectomised p artner  
(A vasectomised partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.)  
Male partner sterilisation prior to the female participant’s entry into the study, and this male 
is the sole partner for that participant,  
(The information on the male sterility can come from the site personnel’s review of the 
participant’s medica l records; medical examination and/or semen analysis, or medical history 
interview provided by [CONTACT_163596]).  
Sexual abstinence  
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.)   
a Typi[INVESTIGATOR_914346] y differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with

• Medical device AE is any untoward medical occurrence, in a clinical study 
participant, users, or other persons, temporally associated with the use of study 
intervention  whether considered related to a medical device or not. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavo urable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated 
with the use  of a medical device. This definition includes events related to the 
medical device or comparator and events related to the procedures involved.  
• An adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of a medical device. This 
definition includes any AE  resulting from:  
− insufficient or inadequate instructions for use (i.e. user error), or  
− any malfunction of a medical device, or  
− intentional misuse of the medical device.  
10.7.2.  Definition  of medical device SAE, SADE and [LOCATION_003]DE  
A medical device SAE is any serious ad verse event that:  
a. Led to death  
b. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant, that either resulted in:  
• A life -threatening illness or injury. The term ‘life -threatening' in the definition of 
‘serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time 
of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused 
death, if it were more severe.

c. Led to f oetal  distress, f oetal  death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
d. Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product . 
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) definition  
• A SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
• Any device deficiency that might have led to an SAE if appropriate action had not 
been taken or circumstances had been less fortunate.  
Unanticipated SADE ([LOCATION_003]DE) definition  
• An [LOCATION_003]DE (also identified as UADE in US Regulations 21 CFR 813.3),  is a 
serious adverse device effect that by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has 
not been identified in the current  version of the IB.  
10.7.3.  Recording and reporting of medical device AE, ADEs, SADEs and 
[LOCATION_003]DE  
• Any device deficiency must be reported to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours after the 
investigator determines that the event meets the definition of a device deficiency.  
• E-mail/Facsimile transmission of the paper ‘Medical device or combination product 
with device deficiency/incident report form’ is the preferred method to transmit this 
information to the sponsor.  
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipm ent, notification by

Document  Date of issue  Section # and title  Description of change  Brief rationale  
Protocol Amendment 1  7 May 2021  Section 1.3, Schedule of activities  
 
Section [IP_ADDRESS], Biological samples  The blood volume for safety assessment 
needs to change to approximately 7 mL 
from approximately 6 mL.  In order to avoid collecting lower volume of 
blood, it was determined that the blood 
sample tubes should be filled to capacity.  
Protocol Amendment 2  21 June 2021  Section 2.3, Benefit/Risk assessment  
Section [IP_ADDRESS], Phase II formulation and 
schedule -finding  
Section 4.2, Scientific rationale for study 
design  
Section 5.1, Inclusion criteria  
Section 6.1, Study intervention(s) 
administered (Table 12)  
Section [IP_ADDRESS], Warnings and 
precautions to vaccination  
Section 8.2.21, Safety d ata review  The Tdap vaccine ( Boostrix ) has been 
removed from the study design of Phase II 
Formulation and schedule -finding. It has 
been replaced by [CONTACT_914389].  To avoid potential confounding factors that 
might impact selection of dosage and 
schedule for further development which is 
one of the primary aims of the study.  
  Section [IP_ADDRESS], Phase II formulation and 
schedule -finding  
Section 6.3.5, Blinding and unblinding  The blinding for Phase II formulation and 
schedule -finding has been changed  to 
‘partially -blind’ from ‘observer -blind’ 
(ABCWY groups = observer -blind; Control 
group = open -label).  
The section on Blinding has been updated 
accordingly.  
Note: The blinding has been removed from 
the study title as it differs between the 
phases in the study.  Since Tdap vaccine has been removed, the 
4 groups administering  
vaccine in different dosages and schedules 
are observer -blind; however the Control 
group receiving MenACWY and MenB 
vaccines at Visit V1 will be open -label.

effectiveness of the  The number of participants in Phase II 
Formulation and Schedule -finding has been 
increased to 1000 from 885 (45 in Step 1 
and 955 in Step 2).  Due to the split in the alpha (for parallel 
testing of   dose), the 
sample size has been increased to maintain 
the power of the analysis.

changes made in all sections noted here . 
Refer to Section 10.10.1 for details.  Since the Control grou p is open -label, 
administration of placebo at Visit V3 (Month 
4) is not required. Therefore this group will 
not have any study intervention administered 
at this timepoint. This visit has been replaced

has been changed to 97.5% CI (from 95% 
CI). In the statistical analyses of the study, the 
alpha has been split due to the decision to

22 March 2022  162 Note 1: This figure represents the main aspects of the study design. Refer to Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7, Schedule 
of activities, for details on all visits and contacts  
Note 2: If local regulations allow  and quality of study procedures is maintained, participant(s) can be offered remote 
visits (e.g. home visits) for the collection of biological samples and/or study intervention administration (except for Visit  
V1 which will always be a clinic visit). Thes e remote visits must be performed by [CONTACT_114007]/ HCPs. Refer to 
the SoA ( Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7) for the timing of these visits. Details of how these visits will be conducted are 
outlined in the SPM. Refer to Section 8 (decentralised study  procedures) for details

Duration of the Phase II (Sourcing) of the study : The intended duration of the Phase II 
(sourcing) of the study, per participant is : 
• approximately  7 months for the  and  groups , 
• approximately 8 months for the  and  groups, 
and, 
• approximately 12 months for the  and  groups.  
Data collection : Standardised Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). Solicited events will 
be collected using a participant diary (el ectronic Diary [eDiary]).  
Sampling schedule for Phase II (Sourcing) of the study : 
• Blood sample: Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for details on collection of blood samples.  
• Urine sample: Urine samples for pregnancy testing will be collected from female 
participant s of childbearing potential  at Visit 1 (Day 1) and Visit 2 (Day 31)  prior to 
the study intervention  (at the following timepoints):  
− at Visit 1 (Day 1) and Visit 2 (Day 31) for the  
 groups,  
− at Visit 1 (Day 1) and Visit 2 (Day 61) for the  
 groups, and,

Protocol Amendment 4 Final  
22 March 2022  163 • The second part of the study [Phase II (Figure 2 and Figure 3] will only commence 
after demonstration of acceptable safety and reactogenicity in Phase I participants 
(Section 4.1.1 ). This Phase II will have 2 components – the formulation and 
schedule -finding part and the blood sourcing part.  
The 0,1 -month schedule was se lected for Phase I and Phase II (Sourcing) because the 
short time interval between vaccinations is conservative for the assessment of 
reactogenicity and safety.   
Furthermore, the   vaccine will also be administered according to a 
0,2month or 0,6month interval (wider dosing schedules) in the Phase II Sourcing part  
to support the finalization  of assay development, further clinical testing , as well as  
assay stability monitoring and maintenance . For this reason, the total sample size of 
subjects in the Phase II Sourcing have been increased.  
In Section 4.4 End of study definition:  
A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she returns for the last visit 
or is available for the last scheduled contact/ visit as described in the prot ocol [Telephone 
T3 in Phase I, Visit V6 in Phase II, Formulation and Schedule -finding and Telephone T2 
or Telephone T3  in Phase II, Sourcing  (as per the group allocation)] . 
End of Study (EoS):  Date of the last testing/reading released of the Human Biologic al 
Samples, related to primary and secondary endpoints. EoS must be achieved no later than 
[ADDRESS_1284844] Visit (LSLV) (LSLV = Day 541, Month 18 in Phase II, 
formulation and schedule -finding).  If the comple tion of testing occur s prior the 
completion of the LSLV  the latter date defines the end of study  visit.  
In Section 5.5 , Criteria for temporarily delaying enrolment/ randomisation/ study 
intervention administration/blood sampling : 
• Signific ant acute illness within the previous 7 days  of study intervention 
administration . 
• A positive test for current infection with COVID -[ADDRESS_1284845] been done using a molecular (polymerase 
chain reaction [PCR] or antigen test) approved by [CONTACT_385015].  
• Participants with known COVID -19 positive contacts and considered at risk of 
having contracted a COVID -19 infection according to local regulations .

In Section 6.3.5 Blinding and unblinding:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase I and Phase II (Sourcing)  
Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. To do so, study intervention(s) will 
be prepared and administered by [CONTACT_914390], evaluation, review or the entry of any study endpoint (i.e. reactogenicity, 
safety, efficacy).  
Note: Due to the different vaccination schedules in Phase II Sourcing, the study will be 
observer blind only in terms of the vaccine formulations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unblinding  
The participant, the site an d sponsor personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of 
the participants will be unblinded to the treatment assig ned at a Phase at completion of 
that particular  Phase.  
Refer to Section 4.4 for the definition of study completion per participant.  
In Section 6.6, Continued access to study intervention after the end of the study : 
During the study conclusion visit/contact (Telephone T3 in Phase I, Visit V6 in Phase II, 
Formulation and Schedule -finding and Telephone T2 / Telephone T3  in Phase II, 
Sourcing  [as per group allocation] ), the investigator will ask each 
participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) if they are interested in participating/allowing 
the participant to join a booster study/long -term study. If a participant/participant’s 
parent(s )/LAR(s) is/are not interested in joining the booster study/long -term study the 
reason for refusal will be documented, when available, in the participant’s eCRF.  
In Section 6.8 Concomitant therapy : 
• All concomitant medication associated with an adverse even t, including 
vaccines/products, except vitamins and dietary supplements, administered after the 
first dose of study intervention (Phase 1 and Phase II, Sourcing: Day 1 to Day 211  or 
Day 241 or Day 361 (as per the group allocation) and Phase II, Formulation  and 
Schedule -finding: Day 1 to Day 541).  
• Any concomitant vaccination administered in the period starting [ADDRESS_1284846] (Phase 1 and

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1284870] the 
majori ty of circula ting meningococca l serogroup B strains and has acceptable 
reactogenici ty and safety profiles when administered to individuals across age groups. 
The vaccine is currently approved in more than 40 countries worldwide. Although the 
meningococcal group B vaccine was developed for individuals aged 2 months and older, 
the actual age range for which this recommendation extends varies depending on the 
approval from different health authorities.  
In Section 2.3, Benefit/Risk assessment:  
Detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and expected 
adverse events of Bexsero (MenB) , and Menveo  (MenACWY) and Boostrix  (Tdap)  
vaccine can be found in the Prescribing Information or Summa ry of Product 
Characteristics.  
As with all injectable vaccines, immediate systemic allergic reactions to vaccination 
can occur. In order to be able to treat participants with an immediate systemic allergic 
reaction to vaccination, all participants will nee d to remain under close observation for 
at least 30 minutes after each study intervention (as per the phase in which they are 
participating: Visit V1 and Visit V3 in Phase I, Visit V1, Visit V3 and Visit V4 in Phase 
II Formulation and Schedule -Finding and Visit V1 and Visit V2 in Phase II 
Sourcing). Refer to Section 6.1.  
In terms of study procedures, blood sampling is associated with a risk of syncope, 
dizziness, local reactions and infection after or during venepuncture. For this reason, 
blood samples in t his study will be obtained by a trained professional and medical 
assistance will be available. The potential risk of feeling faint, experiencing mild local 
pain, bruising, irritation or redness at the site where blood was taken, is mentioned in the 
Informe d Consent Form.  Appropriate medical treatment will be readily available.  
In Section 3, Objectives and endpoints:  
Note 1: MenB immune response will be assessed against N. meningitidis  serogroup B 
indicator strains  
 
 
 
 
 
 
In Section 4.1.2 .1, Phase II: Formulation an d Schedule -finding : 
Phase II (Formulation and Schedule -finding) will include 5 study groups, with a 
staggered enrolment (45 participants for safety lead -in and 840 955 participants 
thereafter) of a total of 885 1000 participants ( Figure 2):

In Section 4.2, Scientific rationale for study design:  
The Tdap vaccine is indicated for the booster immunisation against tetanus, diphtheria 
and pertussis as a single dose in individuals 10 years of age and older. It is a non -
investigational study vaccine, administered to maintain the blinding of the Phase II of the 
study (along with placebo).  
In Section  5.1, Inclusion criteria:  
• Phase I and Phase II (Sourcing)  only: A male or female between, and including, 18 
and 40 years of age (i.e. 40 years + 364 days) at the time of the first study 
intervention administration.  
• Phase  II (Sourcing) only: A male or femal e between, and including, 18 and 50 
years of age (i.e. 50 years + 364 days) at the time of the first study intervention 
administration.  
• Phase II (Formulation and Schedule -finding) only: Participants who have 
received previous doses of tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine can participate 
in the study if they have received it at least 5 years prior to informed consent (and 
assent, as applicable).  
In Section 5.2 Exclusion criteria, in Section 5.2.1, Medical conditions:  
• Systemic administration of corticos teroids (PO/IV/IM) for more than [ADDRESS_1284872] blood sampling visit for 
Phase I and Phase II (Sourcing) and Visit 5 (Day 211) for Phase II (Formulation and 
Schedule -finding). This will mean fo r adult participants prednisone or equivalent  
20 mg/day, and for paediatric participants 0.5 mg/kg/day or 20 mg/day, 
whichever is the maximum dose . This will mean prednisone equivalent ≥20 mg/day

22 March 2 022 199 Section 8.3.6  Medical device deficiencies  
The study interventions (   Bexsero  and placebo ) are combination 
products constituted of a device and biologic product (e.g., pre -filled syringes). Refer to 
Glossary of terms for the definition of a combination product and a medical device 
deficiency.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Detection, follow -up and prompt reporting of medical device deficiency  
The investigator is responsible for the detection, documentation and prompt reporting 
of any medical device deficiency occurring during the study to [COMPANY_004]. This applies to 
any medica l device provided for the conduct of the study.  
Device deficiencies will be reported to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours after the investigator 
determines that the event meets the protocol definition of a device deficiency. Refer to 
Section 10.7 for definitions and de tails on recording and reporting of these events.  
The investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any additional investigations to 
elucidate the nature and/or related of the device deficiency to the incident. Follow -up 
applies to all participants, including those who discontinue study intervention or the 
study.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed form with all 
changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_479697] 24 hours.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Regulatory rep orting of medical device deficiency when used as 
combination product  
The investigator will promptly report all device deficiencies occurring with any medical 
device provided for use in the study to [COMPANY_004]. [COMPANY_004] has a legal responsibility to notify

pregnancies:  
All post -study intervention immediate reactions observed within t he observational 
period of at least 30 minutes after each injection, including signs or symptoms of 
anaphylaxis, allergic phenomena (such as rashes, itching, or other allergic 
manifestations), solicited events, unsolicited events and body temperature, will  be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
All solicited events that occur during 7 days (including the day of vaccination) following 
administration of each dose of study intervention (Day 1 to Day 7) must be recorded into 
the eDiary, irrespective of intensity. All other A Es occurring within this time frame 
should be recorded into the appropriate section of the eCRF, irrespective of their 
intensity or whether or not they are considered related to the study intervention.  
In Section [IP_ADDRESS], Medically attended visits:  
For ea ch solicited and unsolicited AE the participant experiences (Refer to Table 27, 
Table 28 and Table 29) , the participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be asked if 
he/she/the participant received medical attention (defined as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or an 
otherwise unscheduled visit to or from medical personnel for any reason, including 
emergency room visits). This information will be recorded in the eDiary/ eCRF.  
In Section [IP_ADDRESS], Events requiring expedited reporting to [COMPANY_004]:

(ADE), serious adverse device effect (SADE) and unanticipated SADE ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
10.7.[ADDRESS_1284877] (ADE)  
• Medical device AE is any untoward medical occurrence, in a clinical study 
participant, users, or other persons, temporally associated with the use of study 
intervention  whether considered related to a medical device or not. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavo urable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medical device.  This definition includes events related 
to the medical device or comparator and events related to the procedures involved.  
• An adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of a medical device. 
This definition includes any AE resulting from:  
− insufficient or inadequate instructions for use (i.e. user error), or  
− any malfunction of a medical device, or  
− intentional misuse of the medical device.

22 March 2 022 207 10.7.2  Definition of medical device SAE, SADE and [LOCATION_003]DE  
A medical device SAE is any serious adverse even t that:  
a. Led to death  
b. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant, that either resulted 
in: 
• A life -threatening illness or injury. The term ‘life -threatening' in the definition 
of ‘serious' refers to an event in which the participant was  at risk of death at the 
time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have 
caused death, if it were more severe.  
• A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function.  
• Inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]. Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17450] a pre -existing 
condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without serious deterioration 
in health, is not considered an SAE.  
• Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment  to a body structure or a body function . 
c. Led to f oetal  distress, f oetal  death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
d. Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product.  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) definition  
• A SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
• Any device deficiency that might have led to an SAE if appropriate action had 
not been taken or circumstances had been less fortunate.  
Unanticipated SADE ([LOCATION_003]DE) definition  
• An [LOCATION_003]DE (also identified as UADE in US Regulations 21 CFR 813.3),  is a 
serious adverse device effect that by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome 
has not been identified in the current version of the IB.  
10.7.3  Recording and reporting of medical device AE, ADEs, SADEs and [LOCATION_003]DE  
• Any device deficiency must be reported to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours after the 
investigator determines that the event meets the definition of a device deficiency.  
• E-mail/Facsimile transmission of the paper ‘Medical device or combination 
product with device deficiency/incident report form’ is the preferred method to 
transmit this information to the sponsor.  
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
[CONTACT_9337] a copy of ‘Medical device or combination product 
with device deficiency/incident  report form’ sent by [CONTACT_13187].

acceptable level of quality will appropriate personnel be 
unblinded or when required in case of a serious adverse 
event.  
For Phase I and Phase II Sourcing:  In an observer -
blind study, the participant , the site and sponsor 
personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the 
participants are blinded while other study personnel may 
be aware of the treatment assignment.  
For Phase II Formulation and Schedule -finding: 
Partially -blind is to be used for study designs with 
different blinding levels between different groups, e.g. 
double -blinded consistency lots which are open with 
respect to the control group.  
Medical device deficiency:  A device deficiency is an inadequacy of a medical 
device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, 
reliability, safety, or performance. Device deficiencies

Detailed description of the Protocol amendment  (Amendment 1) : This is a country -
specific protocol amendment pertaining to Phase 1 part (conducted in Australia) of this 
seamless Phase I/II study. The blood tubes which are required for collection of blood 
samples for safety laboratory evaluation in Phase 1 hold a max imum volume of 7 mL  and 
it is not possible to measure 6 mL volume in these tubes. Therefore in order to avoid the 
risk of collecting lower volume of blood, this protocol has been amended to document the 
change in the blood sample volume for the safety labo ratory evaluation (from 6 mL to 
7 mL).

Indications for 
Use/Intended Use The MIRI -TL is a purpose built embryo culture incubator using a 
built- in microscope and camera designed specifically for the 
continuous assessment of embryo development in-vitro. As images 
are digitally obtained and stored, a video can be generated to 
enable more obj ective and reliable grading criteria. This 
technology, in conjunction with the MIRI -TL Viewer allows for non -
invasive viability evaluation and assessment allowing for better prediction of embryo developmental potential and implantation 
success.  The MIRI -TL is CE marked for clinical use.  
The CultureCoin is intended to be used to hold human oocytes and embryos during handling and  culture.  
Study  Purpose  The purpose of this study is to demonstrate and validate the non-inferior or superior safety and efficacy of the MIRI -

submission for both products is planned for Q2/Q3  2016.  
As the sponsor of this clinical study, ESCO Medical has the overall responsibility 
for the conduct of the study, including assurance that the study will be performed according to the clinical inves tigation plan, applicable US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and local regulation.  
2.   Background  
The optimal goal of IVF should be the delivery of a healthy singleton baby [CONTACT_322777], financial, and moral 
obligations to reduce multiple pregnancies.1-[ADDRESS_398618] culture, allowing 
embryos to develop in a petri dish for 2 to 3 additional days. Generally, about 40% of the embryos will form a blastocyst while others arrest in the culture dish during this extended period of incubation. It was broadly reported that blastocyst formation was a key embryo selection criterion for predicting successful implantation. Papanikolaou et al demonstrated in prospective 
randomized studies that embryo implantation rates and live birth rates were 
significantly improved with Day [ADDRESS_398619] culture was 
widely  adopted  in  clinics,  in  particular  those  which  utilized  single embryo 
transfer.  
 
Embryos selection based on traditional morphology scores developed in the 
early 1980s. The morphological criteria are based on multiple 'static' 
observations of embryos under regular light microscopes. This involved removing the culture dish, which contained the embryos, from the incubator on a daily 
basis and assessing the embryos based on their morphology and growth.   A number of studies have reported observations relating embryo morphology and implantation, including [ADDRESS_398620] indicated that using information obtained from time -lapse 
imaging, which provides a continuous 'movie' of embryo d evelopment,  may 
improve embryo selection and ultimately improve clinical pregnancy or 
implantation.25-[ADDRESS_398621] which embryo is more likely to lead to a 
successful pregnancy.  
 
3.    Study  Objectives  
The purpose of this clinical study is to demonstrate and validate the safety and 
efficacy of the purpose built MIRI -TL incubator and correlate morphokinetic data 
to improved success rates.   
 
3.1 Primary  Objective  
• To collect  safety and imaging data on the MIRI -TL and CultureCoin.  
 
3.2 Secondary  Objectives  
• To collect enrollment data: demographics, IVF and pregnancy  history  
• To collect Day 3, Day 5 and Day 6 embryo morphology  data  
• To collect pregnancy test and live birth outcome  data  
• To collect pre -implantation genetic screening (PGS) data (if  applicable)  
• To collect Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET) data (if  applicable)  
[ADDRESS_398622] cell division kinetics and 
morphology of developi[INVESTIGATOR_322770].  This novel time -lapse incubator captures images at five (5) minute 
intervals and its six (6) separate incubation chambers maximizes temp erature and gas 
stability, providing a safe and secure environment for human embryos.

4.1 CultureCoin  
The 16- well CultureCoin ( Figure 2 ) is a standard size (60mm) embryo culture dish 
with individual micro - wells aligned in a row in the center of the dish. Each micro -
well is designed to accommodate a single patient’s oocytes or developi[INVESTIGATOR_322771]. The 16 -well 
Culture Coin is designed to fit in only one (1) position in one (1) of the individual 
six (6) incubator chambers, and each micro -well is identified to facilitate embryo 
tracking (for example,  micro -well

the study under a single clinical investigation  plan.  
Expected study duration is 18 months incl uding enrollment and follow -up. 
Subjects will be followed until pregnancy outcome has been determined (i.e. 
date of negative hCG test or 8 -12 week clinical pregnancy ultrasound, if 
pregnant).  
 
6. Study  Design  
This is a prospective, non-blinded, observation al, randomized, double -arm study.  
 
7. Statistical Methods and  Analyses  
Up to 5 00 subjects’ embryos will be collected in this ongoing data collection 
protocol.  We aim to recruit [ADDRESS_398624] culture group, and 300 
patients in the MIRI -TL group.  
Assuming that 25 % of all inseminated oocytes would develop into blastocysts 
(based on published clinical data), at least 1300 inseminated oocytes  (~163 
patients)  would be n eeded in each group to detect an increase in blastocyst  
proportion of 20% with 80% power and a significance level of 0.05 (two -tailed 
tests).   
Assuming that time from insemination to start of blastulation (tSB) follows a 
normal distribu tion, and is 96h with a variance of 49h in euploid embryos, and 
98h (variance 49h) in aneuploid embryos , ~405 blastocysts (1620 inseminated 
oocytes = 203 patients) in the MIRI -TL group will need to be biopsied to detect 
a significant difference in tSB  (80%  power, 0.[ADDRESS_398625]) . 
Since ~80% of all patients receive PGS at our clinical site, we will need ~255 patients in our MIRI -TL group.  
To account for patient dropout and lower than expected oocyte retrieval per patient, we propose to recruit up to 500 subjects in this ongoing data collection 
protocol: [ADDRESS_398626] culture (SC) group and 300 patients in 
the MIRI -TL (MIRI) group.  
Embryos with incomplete annotations will be excluded from analysis. All 
variables will be tes ted for normality using Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] –Wilks test. Continuous data 
following a normal distribution will be  analyzed with Students t -test. 
[ADDRESS_398627]. For categorical data 
Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test will be  used. Two -tailed p -values < 0.05 will 
be considered significant.  
 
8. Study Protocol  
8.0 Patient Randomization  
Patients will be randomized to the MIRI -TL group  (MIRI ) or the Standa rd culture 
group  (SC) by [CONTACT_322778].randomizer.org , 
using a number set from 1 to 500.  Numbers  1-300 will be assigned to the study 
(MIRI -TL) group while numbers  301-500 will be assigned to the control (Standard 
Incubator).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.[ADDRESS_398628] at the clinical 
site. Insemination, by [CONTACT_238550] (ICSI) will take  place on 
Day 0 (egg retrieval day)  following standard protocol currently in place at the 
clinical site.  The fertilized eggs should be free of cumulus cells as much as 
possible. If the cumulus cells remain in place, they may interfere with the quality of the imaging.  Immediately after micro insemination, eggs will be placed in 
individual wells within a CultureCoin (MIRI group), or a s tandard culture dish (SC 
group), and incubated in the MIRI -TL or standard incubator respectively.  All eggs 
will be cultured in the standard fertilization  media currently in place at the 
clinical site. At 20hr after insemination,  the MIRI -TL imaging software will be 
Paused, and  all embryos will be examined by [CONTACT_322779] (2PN) . All normally fertilized eggs will be placed into a new 
CultureCoin (MIRI group) or standard culture dish (SC group) containing the  
standard embryo culture media, and incubated in the MIRI -TL or standard 
incubator respectively . 
Once an embryo is assigned a micro -well locatio n, it must remain in the same 
location throughout the study imaging period. Embryos  assigned to the MIRI 
group  will be imaged  in the CultureCoin  from Day 0 to Day 7. Images of the 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_322772] -TL Microscope. 
Data collected will include the  following:  
• Number of eggs  inseminated  
2016 -TiMMI -001 Confidential   
 • Fertilization  method  
• Total number of fertilized eggs  (2PN)  
 
8.[ADDRESS_398629] procedure. The development 
stage of the embryos and grading based on traditional morphology criteria will 
be recorded. It is recommended that the Day 3 morphology assessment is done 
within 48 hours after the fertilization (2PN) check. Per protocol, Assisted Hatching (AH) is allowed if patients have opted for embryo biopsy and PGS.  
After embryo assessment the embryos may be placed back into the MIRI -TL or 
standard incubator as per their respective groups,  and imaging will be resumed  
for the MIRI group.  
8.[ADDRESS_398630] will evaluate the embryos using traditional morphological 
grading. It is recommended that the Day 5 morphology assessment is done 
within 48 hours after the Day 3 morphology assessment.  
 
8.4 Embryo Biopsy and Preimplantation Genetic Screening Data - if applicable  
Pre-implantation Genetic Screening (PGS) is not required in this study. If the 
physician and the patient have previously decided to perform PGS in the IVF 
cycle, the outcome data will be collected. Embryo biopsy and PGS will be 
performed per standard procedure. Transfer procedures and disposition of 
embryos not selected for transfer will be determined as per the standard protocol in place at the time of the study.  
8.5 Embryo  Transfer 
Embryo(s) will be selected for transfer based on  the current standard protocol in 
place at the clinical site. Data pertaining to the embryo transfer procedure will include the  following:  
• Day and date of transfer  
• Total number of embryos  transferred  
• Luteal phase  support  
 
8.6 Outcome: Pregnancy  Test  
After embryo transfer, each subject will be followed to determine if a chemical 
pregnancy has been achieved by [CONTACT_322780]’ standard serum pregnancy testing procedure.  Data will be recorded and include the  following:  
2016 -TiMMI -001 Confidential   
 • Date of the serum pregnanc y test 
• Quantitative hCG  level  
 
Each subject with a positive serum pregnancy test result will continue to be 
followed. If the result of the pregnancy test is negative, the subject will have 
completed the study and be exited at that time.  
8.7 Outcome: Pregna ncy Confirmation  Ultrasound  
A clinical pregnancy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_322773] a fetal heartbeat via vaginal ultrasound. The clinical site verifies clinical pregnancy at approximately [ADDRESS_398631] will be recorded and include the following:  
• Date of  ultrasound  
• Result of initial pregnancy  ultrasound  
o Number of intrauterine gestational  sacs 
o Number of fetal heart beats  
 
If the result of the ultrasound is negative, that is, if no fetal heartbeat is 
detected, then the subject will have completed the study and be exited at that 
time.  
8.8 Outcome: Ongoing Pregnancy  Ultrasound  
The clinical site verifies the viability of the pregnancy (ongoing pregnancy) at approximately 8 -12 weeks gestational age via vaginal ultrasound. Data will be 
recorded and include the  following:  
• Date of  ultrasound  
• Result of  ultrasound  
o Number of gestational  sacs 
o Number of fetal  heartbeats  
• Pregnancy  outcome  
 
If the result of the ultrasound is negative, that is, if an ongoing pregnancy is not 
confirmed, then the subject will have completed the study and be exited at that 
time.  
8.9 Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET) Cycles –  if applicable  
If the patient does not get pregnant from the fresh embryo transfer, data from 
blastocysts previously frozen in the fresh cycle may be thawed for a FET for the 
duration of the study. Endometrial preparation for FET cycles will be performed 
per the clinical sites standard protocol. Data pertaining to the stimulation protocol, pregnancy, and outcome data will be  collected.

event will be followed until resolved or stabilized at a level acc eptable to the 
investigator.  
Events well documented to be associated with ART/IVF procedures (as outlined 
in each clinic’s consent for IVF procedures) will not be collected as adverse events under this protocol. Other common non- study or non- device related , 
minor health complaints will not be collected as adverse events (for example: 
colds, sprains,  headaches).  
The investigator should follow the reporting requirements of the reviewing IRB/REB for all adverse events (including serious and unanticipated adver se 
device effects). Documentation of any IRB and Esco Global notifications should 
be maintained in the site’s clinical study files. It is recommended that 
acknowledgement of receipt from the IRB be maintained in the study file as well.  
Adverse events will be reported to Esco Global and data collected will include 
the following:  
• Date of adverse  event  
• Type of event and  description  
• Action/treatment taken 
• Severity of  event  
• Seriousness of  event  
• Investigator’s assessment as to the relationship of the AE to the MIRI -
TL 
• Investigator’s assessment as to the relationship of the AE to IVF/ART 
procedures  
Investigator’s assessment if the event is a potential Unanticipated 
Adverse Device Effect  (UADE) 
 
Source documentation for adverse events must be collected and filed w ith the 
subject’s medical chart. Refer to Section 10 – Adverse Event Definitions and 
Reporting for additional information. Because study procedures are limited to 
the noninvasive collection of clinical data, no Data Safety Monitoring Board will 
be establis hed for this  study.

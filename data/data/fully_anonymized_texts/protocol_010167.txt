Version: 4/3/2020 1 Introduction  
This is a Phase II trial of definitive chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) given with the protease inhibitor, 
Nelfinavir (NFV), in patients with locally advanced  head and neck  cancer.  Eligible patients will 
receive a “lead -in” period of Nelfinavir (1250 mg po bid) for 7 -14 days prior to initiation of 
CTRT.  Nelfinavir will then be given concurrently with platinum -based chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy (planned total dose of 70 Gy over 7 weeks).   
 
All patients will also undergo the following:  
1) 18F-FMISO  PET/CT: this scan assesses tumor hypo xia. Patients will undergo 2 separate  
18F-FMISO  PET/CT scans: the first at  baseline to determine baseline tumor hypoxia, the 
second after a 7 -14 day lead- in of NFV prior to CTRT (to determine change in tumor 
oxygenation secondary to NFV) . Six patients will receive 3 separate 18F-FMISO  PET/CT, 
the first at baseline to determine b aseline tumor hypoxia, the second also at baseline to 
determine reliability of the scan for test -retest purposes, the third after a 7- 14-day lead -in 
of NFV.  
2) 18F-FDG PET/CT: this scan assesses glucose uptake. Patient will undergo 2 separate 18F-
FDG PET/CT  scans: the first at baseline as part of routine clinical care, for purposes of 
radiation treatment planning and the second after a 7- 14 day lead- in of NFV prior to 
CTRT (to determine change in tumor glucose uptake secondary to NFV).  
 
The primary objective of the study will be to determine whether NFV, given with definitive 
CTRT, will improve locoregional control  in locally advanced head and neck cancer.   
 
Secondary objectives of this study include:  
- To determine the effect of NFV on hypoxia, as assessed by 18F-FMISO  PET/CT.  
- To determine the effect of NFV on glucose metabolism, as assessed by 18F-FDG PET/CT, and 
possible associations between hypoxia and glucose metabolism. 
1.1 Background  
Radiation therapy is a commonly used treatment for cancer. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_510470], 
state-of-the-art techniques, local -regional control is often not achieved in many cases, leading to 
recurrence. A case in point is locally advanced head and neck s quamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 
cancer, which has a 5 -year locoregional control rate of 33.7% following combined chemoradiation 
(1). In 2012 there were over 50,000 new cases of HNSCC with approximately 11,500 deaths ( 2). 
While the overall prognosis of HNSCC appears to be improving, this may be due to changing 
demographics with a higher percentage of cases associated with HPV, which appears to have a 
better prognosis than HPV -negative HNSCC ( 3).  
 Previous studies of hypoxic radiosensitizers have shown promise. In the TROG 02.02 
phase III trial of definitive head and neck chemoradiation +/ - tirapazamine, there was a trend 
favoring the tirapazamine arm for improved locoregiona l control in patients who were HPV -
negative ( 5). For patients identified to have hypoxic disease via F -MISO PET scanning who did 
not receive tirapazamine,  locoregional control was 38% at a median followup of 3.6 yrs, versus 
95% in similar patients who received tirapazamine ( 6). 
One approach for increasing the therapeutic window of r adiotherapy is to combine 
radiation therapy with biological agents. Over the past few years, we have focused on agents that 
can modulate the tumor microenvironment to improve radiation response ( 7, 8). One particular 
5 
Version: 4/3/2020 agent, nelfinavir, has been widely used in HIV patients with well -characterized pharmacokinetics 
and low toxicity profile. NFV inhibits the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which we believe increases 
the intrinsic radiosensitivity of ce lls (9-11). However, the effects of NFV on the in vivo radiation 
response appear to be greater  than those seen in vitro, which led us to investigate whether the drug 
might have effects on the tumor microenvironment (TME) that could improve the radiation 
response. Indeed, we and others have found that NFV treatment of mice bearing tumor xenografts 
leads to improved oxygenation ( 10, 12). This is  potentially clinically important because hypoxia 
is a factor associated with poor prognosis in many cancers, including HNSCC ( 13-15). Hypoxic 
cells require higher doses of radiation compared to oxic cells to achieve the same level of killing 
due to the requirement of oxygen to elicit maximal DNA damage through the oxidation of DNA 
and other target radicals (16). This leads us to one of our hypotheses that a major mechanism by 
[CONTACT_510491].      
 
Determinants & Mechanisms of Nelfinavir Response  
A phase I/II trial at Penn has been conducted in which NFV was combined with cisplatin-
based (as with this protocol)  chemotherapy and radiation for stage IIIA/B non- small cell lung 
cancer ( 17). The phase I trial showed that NFV given at a dose of 1250 mg  (which was found to 
be the MTD)  orally twice a day was well tolerated by [CONTACT_510492]. 
There were no dose limiting toxicities on this [ADDRESS_660078] the idea than NFV can modulate 
tumor hypoxia or include hypoxia imaging. There are several methods that are available to 
measure hypoxia in human tumors including Eppendorf needle electrode and 2- nitroimida zole 
binding ( 18). 2-nitroimidazole drugs are reduced and form adducts with protein thiols in hypoxic 
cells ( 19).   
 
1-H-1-(3-[18F] fluoro -2-hydroxypropyl) -2-nitroimidazole also known as 
[18F]fluoromisonidazole or 18F-FMISO  is a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical that has 
been studied in vivo in humans for measurement of regional hypoxia in a number of tumor types 
with positron emission tomography (PET/CT).  Grierson et al described synthesis methods that 
yielded high specific activity18F-FMISO for use in PET imaging studies [Grierson 1989]. 
Fluoromisonidazole is a congener of misonidazole, which is an electron affinic drug with 
selective binding in cells with reduced pO 2 [Chapman 1981, 1983, Franko 1984].  An ideal 
hypoxia -imaging agent should distribute independently of blood flow, which is best achieved 
when the partition coefficient of the tracer is close to unity. Under these circumstances, imaging 
data can be acquired at a time w hen the intracellular tracer distribution has equilibrated with the 
tracer in plasma near the cells. 18F-FMISO is an azomycin- based hypoxic cell sensitizer, 
because [18F]FMISO partitions nearly equally between octanol and water, normoxic tissues 
have T/B ( tissue/blood) pi[INVESTIGATOR_510471] 1.0. The hypoxic part of a tumor can be 
characterized by [CONTACT_510493] T/B value or by [CONTACT_510494][INVESTIGATOR_510472] T/B greater than 
some threshold. These pi[INVESTIGATOR_510473]/pi[INVESTIGATOR_510474], (HV). Rasey et al characterized the binding characteristics of 18F-FMISO in 
cells in vitro  at various oxygen levels and in animal studies of tumors. Results demonstrated the 
oxygen dependent binding of radiolabeled fluoromisonidazole i n vitro  and in vivo  and supported 
the use of 18F-FMISO as a quantitative hypoxia probe using the measurement of retention of 
18F-FMISO in tumor vs blood and normal tissue to  calculate hypoxic fraction in tumors  [Rasey 
1989]. 18F-FMISO PET/CT provides a val uable non- invasive method to measure viable hypoxic 
cells in human malignancies, which may aid in better understanding mechanisms of resistance 
and response to treatments, such as radiation or anti -angiogenesis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
6 
Version: 4/3/2020 The injectable dose of 18F-FMISO for this study will be ≤ 10mCi (with an exp ected range of 5 - 10 
mCi at the time of injection) which has been shown to generate high quality PET/CT images 
with acceptable radiation dose to subjects, the drug mass injected for each study with be ≤ 15 
µg.  
 
In the current protocol we focus on the central hypothesis that NFV will result in a decrease 
in tumor hypoxia  in head and neck tumors, and that this alteration in hypoxia plays a role in its 
ability to radiosensitize, leading to improved treatment outcomes. We also hypothesize that: 1) the 
effect of NFV on hypoxia can be assessed by 18F-EF5 or by 18F-FMISO ,( the initial [ADDRESS_660079] been completed using 18F-EF-5) and 2) changes in hypoxia will correlate with changes in 
glucose metabolism  (decrease in glucose uptake) , as assessed by  18F-FDG PET/CT scanning.   
 
Summary  
 We propose a clinical trial of the HIV protease inhibitor, nelfinavir, and concurrent, 
definitive chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced, HPV -negative head and neck cancer. 
This is an ideal population because of their poor prognosis with current therapy and the fact that 
HNSCC tumors are known to be hypoxic. Furthermore, activation of the EGFR/PI3K pathway is 
common in HNSCC, identified in 74% of cases in one report  (30), so these tumors should respond 
to NFV. Assessment of tumor oxygenation response to NFV will be made using 18F-FMISO  
PET/CT scanning and correlation of hypoxia with glucose metabolism will be assessed via 18F-
FDG PET/CT scanning . If the combination of NFV and radiation is found to be effective in this 
group of patients, it could then be extended to patients with other cancers.

2.2.2 To determine  whether glucose metabolism (as assessed by 18F-FDG PET/CT)  
is affected by [CONTACT_510495] , and whether this corresponds to a decrease in 18F-

Version: 4/3/2020 3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
Twenty -eight  subjects will be enrolled on this clinical trial investigating the efficacy of definitive 
NFV + CTRT for locally advanced head and neck cancer. Patients will also receive two  18F-
FMISO  PET/CT studies: the first at baseline to determine baseline tumor hypoxia, the second after 
a 7-14 day lead -in of NFV prior to CTRT (to determine change in tumor ox ygenation secondary 
to NFV).  . Additionally, patients will undergo 2 separate 18F-FDG PET/CT scans: the first at 
baseline as part of routine clinical care, for purposes of radiation treatment planning and the second 
after a 7 -14 day lead- in of NFV prior to CTRT (to determine change in tumor glucose uptake 
secondary to NFV).  The research  18F-FMISO  PET/CT and 18F-FDG  PET/CT studies are 
mandatory, in order to participate on this clinical trial.  Only under circumstances where the PI, 
Alexander Lin, deems the patient is unable to comply with the PET/CT requirements will its 
completion be excused and allow the pat ient to remain on the study.    
 
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints 
The intent of this protocol is to determine the efficacy of NFV + CTRT for locally advanced, 
HPV- negative head and neck  cancer. Therefore,  the primary endpoint will be locoregional 
control . However, secondary objectives will be (1) to determine the effect of NFV on hypoxia as 
assessed by 18F-FMISO PET /CT imaging  (the initial 15 subjects were imaged with 18F-EF5) and 
(2) determine whether glucose metabolism (as assessed by 18F-FDG PET/CT) is affected by 
[CONTACT_510495], and whether this corresponds to a decrease in 18F-FMISO  uptake.   NFV responders have a 
better treatment outcome than NFV non -responders will be tested by [CONTACT_510496]. The definition of "NFV responder " requires greater knowledge about the 
distribution and variance of the baseline T:M ratio. For example, a decrease in T:M ratio to 
<1.25 or percent decrease from baseline of >50% may be reasonable definitions.   
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
18F-FMISO  PET/CT  
Patients will receive two  hypoxia PET/CT scans with either 18F-FMISO or 18F-EF5 (initial 15 
subjects were completed using EF -5, subsequent subjects will be imaged with FMISO) : the first 
at baseline to determine baseline tumor hypoxia, and the second after a 7-14 day lead- in of NFV 
prior to CTRT (to determine change in tumor oxygenation secondary to NFV). Tumor regions of 
interest (ROIs), corresponding to the primary tumor site and pathologic lymph nodes will be 
drawn with the help of CT images. Tumor to mus cle ratios (TMR) will be determined for each 
ROI. A TMR of >  1.[ADDRESS_660081] -NFV hypoxia (i.e., 18F-FMISO

4.3 Inclu sion of Women and Minorities  
The University of Pennsylvania Medical Center serves the metropolitan Philadelphia area, 
the surrounding suburban counties, southern New Jersey, and northern Delaware.  
Inclusion of minorities: The University of Pennsylvania Ca ncer Center reports that minorities 
accounted for 14% of all patients (adult and pediatric) enrolled on therapeutic clinical trials.  
Furthermore, it is estimated that approximately 30% of cancer patients admitted to the 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510478] (source:  University of 
Pennsylvania Cancer Center Grant).  Female and male patients of all ethnic groups will be 
eligible for treatment in these protocols.  Protocol accrual will be reviewed annually to 
include a determination of minority representation. An attempt will be made to enroll patients 
with larynx cancer in a distribution that matches the frequency of incident larynx cancer in 
the general population. The minority accrual estimates for our trial are based upon the total 
number of patients, the incidence rates of head and neck larynx cancer, and estimates in the 
literature regarding minority accrual in clinical trials. A study by [CONTACT_510501] ( 31) 
found that the accrual of American cancer patients to NCI -sponsored treatment trials 
paralleled the incident disease burden among minorities. A report by [CONTACT_510502]. ( 32) 
indicates the di stribution of incident head and neck squamous cell carcinoma to be 81.8%, 
21.1%, 11.9%, 5.2%, 3.7%, 0.3%, and 0.8% among whites, all minorities, blacks, Asians, 
Hispanics, others and unknowns, respectively. The Philadelphia metropolitan area does not 
have a large American Indian or Alaskan population; therefore, no patients are estimated for 
this group.  
 
Inclusion of women: Recruitment of patients will be through the University of Pennsylvania 
Cancer Center, Department of Radiation Oncology. All patients me eting study requirements 
will be approached for participation without discrimination. According to Cancer Facts and 
Figures (2011) from the American Cancer Society (33), new cases of larynx cancer were 
divided approximately 4:1 among male and female patients. Based on these and the above 
minority data, we estimate the accrual distributions for this trial shown below:

5 Study Drugs  
5.1 Description  
Nelfinavir  
There are ample data available regarding the use of NFV in humans ( 34). The following is an 
excerpt of the key features.  
VIRACEPT® (nelfinavir  mesylate) is an inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
protease. VIRACEPT Tablets are available for oral administration as a light blue, capsule -shaped 
tablet with a clear film coating in 250 mg strength (as NFV free base) and as a white oval  tablet 
with a clear film coating in 625 mg strength (as NFV free base). Each tablet contains the following 
common inactive ingredients: calcium silicate, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, 
and triacetin. In addition, the 250 mg tablet contains FD&C blue #2 powder and the 625 mg tablet 
contains colloidal silicon dioxide. VIRACEPT Oral Powder is available for oral administration in 
a 50 mg/g strength (as NFV free base) in bottles. The oral powder also contains the following 
inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, maltodextrin, dibasic potassium phosphate, 
crospovidone, hypromellose, aspartame, sucrose palmitate, and natural and artificial flavor. The 
chemical name [CONTACT_399086] [3 S-[2(2S*, 3S*), 3a,4ab,8ab]] -N-(1,1-
dimethylethyl)decahydro -2-[2-hydroxy -3-[(3-hydroxy -2-methylbenzoyl)amino] -4- 
(phenylthio)butyl] -3-isoquinoline carboxamide mono- methanesulfonate (salt) and the molecular 
weight is 663.90 (567.79 as the free base). Nelfinavir mesylate has the following structural 
formula:  
 
Nelfinavir mesylate is a white to off -white amorphous powder, slightly soluble in water at pH 4 
and freely soluble in methanol, ethanol, 2- propanol and propylene glycol.  
Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetic properties of NFV were evaluated in hea lthy volunteers and HIV -infected 
patients; no substantial differences were observed between the two groups.  
Absorption: Pharmacokinetic parameters of NFV (area under the plasma concentration -time curve 
during a 24 -hour period at steady -state [AUC24], peak plasma concentrations [Cmax], morning 

15 
Version: 4/3/2020 and evening trough concentrations [Ctrough]) from a pharmacokinetic study in HIV -positive 
patients after multiple dosing with 1250 mg (five 250 mg tablets) twice daily (BID) for 28 days 
(10 patients) and 750 mg (three 250 mg tablets) three times daily (TID) for 28 days (11 patients) 
are summarized in Table 1.  
 
The difference between morning and afternoon or evening trough concentrations for the TID and 
BID regimens was also observed in healthy volunteers who were dosed at precisely 8 - or 12 -hour 
intervals. In healthy volunteers receiving a single 1250 mg dose, the 625 mg tablet was not 
bioequivalent to the 250 mg tablet formulation. Under fasted conditions (n=27), the AUC and 
Cmax were 34% and 24% higher, respectively, for the 625 mg tablets. In a relative bioavailability 
assessment under fed conditions (n=28), the AUC was 24% higher for the 625 mg tablet; the Cmax 
was comparable for both formulations. In healthy volunteers receiving a single [ADDRESS_660089] of Food on Oral Absorption: Food increases NFV exposure and decreases NFV 
pharmacokinetic variability relative to the fasted state. In one study, he althy volunteers received a 
single dose of 1250 mg of VIRACEPT 250 mg tablets (5 tablets) under fasted or fed conditions 
(three different meals). In a second study, healthy volunteers received single doses of 1250 mg 
VIRACEPT (5 x 250 mg tablets) under fas ted or fed conditions (two different fat content meals). 
The results from the two studies are summarized in Table [ADDRESS_660090] study has not been conducted with the 625 mg tablet. However, based 
on a cross -study comparison (n=26 fed vs. n=26 fasted) following single dose administration of 
NFV [ADDRESS_660091] for the 625 mg NFV tablet appears compara ble to 
that of the 250 mg tablets. VIRACEPT should be taken with a meal. 

16 
Version: 4/3/2020 Distribution: The apparent volume of distribution following oral administration of NFV was 2- 7 
L/kg. NFV in serum is extensively protein- bound (>98%).  
Metabolism : Unchanged NFV compri sed 82- 86% of the total plasma radioactivity after a single 
oral 750 mg dose of 14C -NFV. In vitro , multiple cytochrome P -450 enzymes including CYP3A 
and CYP2C19 are responsible for metabolism of NFV. One major and several minor oxidative 
metabolites were f ound in plasma. The major oxidative metabolite has in vitro antiviral activity 
comparable to the parent drug.  
Elimination: The terminal half -life in plasma was typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 3.5 to 5 hours. The majority (87%) of 
an oral 750 mg dose containing 14C -NFV was recov ered in the feces; fecal radioactivity consisted 
of numerous oxidative metabolites (78%) and unchanged NFV (22%). Only 1 -2% of the dose was 
recovered in urine, of which unchanged NFV was the major component.  
Special Populations  
Hepatic Insufficiency: The multi- dose pharmacokinetics of NFV have not been studied in HIV -
positive patients with hepatic insufficiency.  
Renal Insufficiency: The pharmacokinetics of NFV have not been studied in patients with renal 
insufficiency; however, less than 2% of NFV is excre ted in the urine, so the impact of renal 
impairment on NFV elimination should be minimal.  
Gender and Race: No significant pharmacokinetic differences have been detected between males 
and females. Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been evalua ted. 
[18F]FMISO  
Description  
1-H-1-(3-[18F]fluoro -2-hydroxypropyl) -2-nitroimidazole  also known as 
[18F]fluoromisonidazole or [18F]FMISO  is a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical that 
has been studied in vivo in humans for measurement of regional hypoxia in a number of 
tumor types with positron emission tomography (PET/CT).  Grierson et al described 
synthesis methods that yielded high specific activity 18F-FMISO for use in PET imaging 
studies [Grierson 1989]. F luoromisonidazole is a congener of misonidazole which is an 
electron affinic drug with selective binding in cells with reduced pO 2 [Chapman 1981, 
1983, Franko 1984].  An ideal hypoxia -imaging agent should distribute independently of 
blood flow, which is be st achieved when the partition coefficient of the tracer is close to 
unity. Under these circumstances, imaging can be done at a time when the intracellular 
tracer distribution has equilibrated with the tracer in plasma near the cells. 18F-FMISO is 
an azomy cin-based hypoxic cell sensitizer that has a nearly ideal partition coefficient and, 
when reduced by [CONTACT_68413], binds covalently to cellular molecules at rates that are 
inversely proportional to intracellular oxygen concentration, rather than by [CONTACT_510503]. Rasey et al characterized the binding 
characteristics of 18F-FMISO in cells in vitro  at various oxygen levels and in animal 
studies of tumors. Results demonstrated the oxygen dependent binding of radiolabeled 
fluoromisonidazole  in vitro  and in vivo  and supported the use of 18F-FMISO as a 
quantitative hypoxia probe using the measurement of retention of 18F-FMISO in tumor vs 
blood and normal tissue to  calculate hypoxic fraction in tumors[Rasey 1989]. The drug is 
a clear solution t hat is provided at room temperature in a sealed, sterile , pyrogen- free vial 
17 
Version: 4/3/2020 and has an expi[INVESTIGATOR_375285] 6 hours. The injectable dose of 18F-FMISO will be ≤ 10 
mCi with an expected range of 5 -10 mCi at the time of injection. In the dose of  18F-
FMISO, onl y a small fraction of the FMISO molecules are radioactive.  There is no 
evidence that nonradioactive and radioactive FMISO molecules display different 
biochemical behavior.  
 
 Preparation of Study Drug  (18F-FMISO)  
 
The manufacturing of 18F-FMISO  will occur in the Cyclotron Facility of the Department 
of Radiology at the University of Pennsylvania.  This facility manufactures USP 
compliant radio -labeled compounds for human use on a daily basis.  The drug 
manufacturing will be fully documented and controlled by a set of Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs) prepared and maintained by [CONTACT_510504].   
 
 Study Drug Administration: 18F-FMISO  
 
The 18F-FMISO  dose will be drawn and activity measured in the dose calibrator , in the imaging 
facility . The dose will be administered by [CONTACT_510505] a Nuclear Medicine Authorized User.   The injected  dose of 18F-FMISO for this 
study  will be ≤ 10 mCi (approximate range for most studie s is anticipated to be 5- 10 mCi ). A 
lesser  dose may be injected if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a Nuclear Medicine Authorized User , complete 
imaging data could be generated.  In the dose of 18F-FMISO , only a small fraction of the F MISO  
molecules are radioactive. 18F-FMISO  is administered to sub jects by [CONTACT_439] .  The 
injection and/or imaging procedure will be terminated in any patient who exhibits anaphylaxis, 
significant dyspnea or chest pain.  
 
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
All subjects will begin taking daily or al nelfinavir, at a dose of 1250 mg bid, 7 to 14 days prior to 
the start of CTRT. At any point during the study, if a patient cannot tolerate swallowing NFV 
tablets or require PEG for medication administration , then the tablet can be crushed and 
dissolved in water for consumption orally or via PEG. Directions for dissolving NFV are as 
follows:  
 
• Place Nelfinavir tablet(s) in small amount of water.  
• Once dissolved, mix the cloudy liquid well, and consume it immediately.  
• The glass should be rinsed with water and the rinse swallowed to ensure the entire dose is consumed.  
 Nelfinavir will be continued during the complete course of concurrent CTRT.  The 7- 14 day 
window of pre -CTRT nelfinavir is included to allow for imaging with [18F]-FMISO  PET/CT and 
[18F]-FDG P ET/CT evaluation to assess for changes in tumor oxygenation and glucose uptake  
18 
Version: 4/3/2020 secondary to NFV.  Subjects will be asked to maintain a drug diary to assess compliance with 
administration of nelfinavir.  
 
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
The subjects will be identified for this study based on their inclusion/exclusion criteria. Since this 
is a phase II study, there is no assignment to treatment groups and all subjects are treated as per 
protocol. 
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
Nelfinavir will be available in Investigational Drug Services (IDS) at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406091]. When a subject is enrolled, the drug will be obtained from IDS and dispensed in 
the Department of Radiation Oncology. It is stored at room  temperature.  
 
Preparation and administration of [18F]-FMISO  is described in the CMC section. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_660092] medication compliance will be monitored via 2 mechanisms: 1)  a medication diary for 
Nelfinavir.  Subjects will be asked to  complete and return the diary each week of their treatment.  
2) via Epic med reconciliation (MD attestation of med reconciliation is recorded and tracked within 
Epic) at the patient’s weekly visit with their treatment MD during the course of radiotherapy.   If 
necessary, the subject will be counseled on medication issues.  Patients who discontinue the use 
of Nelfinavir due to side effects will still be followed as a study subject as per the intent to treat 
analysis.  
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Any prior therapy is permitted with the exception of radiation therapy to the head and neck 
(defined as more than 5 fractions and more than 10 Gy) and any standard chemotherapy within 
the last [ADDRESS_660093] in 30 day cycles.   
5.8 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
5.8.1 Receipt of Drug Supplies 
Nelfinavir will be bought and stored as needed by [CONTACT_8021]. 
[18F]-FMISO  will be synthesized  at the cyclotron facility of the University of Pennsylvania  
and delivered to Department of Radiation Oncology in the Perelman Center for Advanced 
Medicine by a trained Cyclotron team member in single dose vials according to the standard 
procedures outline d by [CONTACT_510506].  Once the drug has been delivered to the 
19 
Version: 4/3/[ADDRESS_660094] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510479], 
processing, and destruction of any residual amounts if applicable. As [18F]-FMISO  is a short -
lived radiotracer with a half -life of approximately 110 minutes it will be synthesized for same 
day use, [18F]-FMISO  will not be stored. The remaining activity in the vials that exists in the 
lab will be stored only until the activity decays to undetectable level.  All vials will be 
disposed of according to the standard operating procedure set forth by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
 
5.8.[ADDRESS_660095] is in clinic.  
 
The [18F]FMISO  dose will be drawn and accurately measured in the dose calibrator in the 
imaging facility and administered by [CONTACT_510507] a Nuclear Medicine Authorized User.  The injectable dose of [18F]FMISO  
for most studies will be ≤  10 mCi (  expected range at injection  5  – 10 mCi) , a lesser dose 
may be injected if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a Nuclear  Medicine Authorized User complete 
imaging data could be generated.  In the dose of [18F]FMISO , only some fractions of the 
FMISO  molecules are radioactive. [18F]-FMISO  is administered to subjects by [CONTACT_510508] ≤ [ADDRESS_660096] pain.  
 
5.8.3 Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
Nelfinavir : At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of drug shipped, 
drug consumed, and drug remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged on the drug 
reconciliation form, signed and dated.  Any discrepancies noted will be investigated, 
resolved, and documented prior to return or destr uction of unused study drug.  Drug 
destroyed on site will be documented by [CONTACT_8021].  
 
[18F]-FMISO : If the entire study drug dose is administered, the radioactive syringe will be 
disposed of into the radioactive waste in the Department of Radiation Oncology in the 
Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine.  As the radioactive half -life of 18F is 1.[ADDRESS_660097] biologic waste upon sufficient decay of its radioactivity.

Version: 4/3/2020 6 Study  Procedures  
6.1 General study design  
Twenty -eight  subjects will be enrolled on this clinical trial investigating the efficacy of definitive 
NFV + CTRT for locally advanced head and neck cancer. Patients will also receive t wo 18F-
FMISO  PET/CT studies: the first at baseline to determine baseline tumor hypoxia  and the second 
after a 7 -14 day lead -in of NFV prior to CTRT (to determine change in tumor oxygenation 
secondary to NFV). Patients will undergo 2 separate 18F-FDG PET/CT scans: the first at baseline 
as part of routine clinical care, for purposes of radiation treatment planning and the second after a 
7-14 day lead- in of NFV prior to CTRT (to determine change in tumor glucose uptake secondary 
to NFV). Additional ly, blood and serum ( two tubes, approximately 15 ml ) will be collected for 
tumor biomarker analysis twice: once at baseline, and again after completion lead -in NFV, prior 
to CTRT.

Version: 4/3/2020 6.2 Nelfinavir Administration   
All subjects will begin taking daily oral nelfinavir, at a dose of 1250 mg bid, 7 to 14 days prior to 
the start of CTRT.  Nelfinavir will be continued during the complete course of concurrent CTRT.  
The 7 -14 day window of pre -CTRT nelfinavir is included to allow for imaging with 18F-FMISO  
and 18F-FDG PET/CT to assess for changes in tumor oxygenation and glucose uptake  secondary 
to NFV.  Subjects will be asked to maintain a drug diary to assess compliance with 
administration of nelfinavir.   Subjects will also undergo weekly med reconciliation of 
compliance with taking NFV during their scheduled visit with their treating MD during 
radiotherapy (MD attestation of med reconciliation is recorded and tracked within EPIC).   
 
6.[ADDRESS_660098] cisplatin chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin will be administered as concurrent 
therapy with radiation. Cisplatin 100 mg/m2 will be administered on days 1, 22, and 43, with 
pretreatment and post treatment hydration and a polyantiemetic r egimen. Patients may also be 
treated with either weekly cisplatin  or weekly cetuximab, which is another FDA -approved drug 
shown to be an effective radiosensitizer in the treatment of head and neck cancer (36, 37) .  
Patients who are receiving cetuximab may receive a loading dose, as per standard of care, prior 
to their completion of their repeat imaging, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_510509].   The 
treating medical oncolog ist may make adjustments to the chemotherapy regimen and/or dosing, 
as they deem medically appropriate . Development of severe dysphagia, dehydration, orthostasis, 
or other unforeseen grade [ADDRESS_660099] each subjects administration as they see medically appropriate.   
6.4 Radiation Therapy  
Radiation therapy in all subjects will begin 7 to 14 days after the initiation of nelfinavir.   
 
Simulation for treatment is required. PET/CT -based treatment planning is require d. Treatment will 
be delivered via intensity -modulated photon or pencil -beam proton radiotherapy.  All fields will be 
treated every session.  Interruptions in therapy should be discussed with the principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_510480]. 
 
The gross tumor volume, clinical treatment volume, and planning treatment volume are defined 
according to ICRU 50. Dose calculation should be performed using inhomogen eity corrections to 
account for differences in tissue density across the head and neck region.  The total dose to gross 
disease will be 70 Gy.  This will be administered in 2.0 Gy daily fractions. Regional lymph node 
regions may be treated, as dictated by [CONTACT_510510]. High -risk elective nodal regions would 
receive anywhere from 59.5 to 63 Gy, administered in 1.7- 1.8 Gy daily fractions, while low -risk 
elective nodal regions would receive anywhere from 56 to 59.5 Gy, administered in 1.6- 1.7 Gy 
daily fr actions.  Treatment will be continuous, 5 days per week for 7 consecutive weeks.  
 
Normal tissue doses:  Dose -volume histograms should be performed for organs at risk, such as the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], brainstem, optic nerves and chiasm, pharyngeal constrictors, and mandible.  The 
22 
Version: 4/3/[ADDRESS_660100] dose should not exceed 45 Gy.  The maximal dose to the brainstem, optic 
nerves and chiasm, should not exceed 54 Gy. The mean dose to the pharyngeal constrictors should 
not exceed 50 Gy. The maximal dose to the mandible ( not included in the planning treatment 
volume) should not exceed 70 Gy.  
 
6.5 18F-FMISO  PET/CT Imaging 
Two 18F-FMISO  PET/CT imaging scans to assess tumor oxygen level in response to treatment 
with Nelfinavir will be performed.  Pregnancy tests will be performe d prior to each scan. The first 
18F-FMISO  PET/CT will occur shortly after enrollment, prior to administration of any therapy. The 
second will occur after a 7 -14 day period of NFV alone.   
 
The 18F-FMISO  PET/CT  study will be conducted at the Imaging Service s Center located in the 
Department of Radiation Oncology, Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine, University of 
Pennsylvania Medical Center.  Subjects  will receive 18F-FMISO  intravenously over a period of 
approximately a minute. Subjects will then lie on a table under the PET scanning machine for the 
procedure . The following is a timetable for the 18F-FMISO  PET/CT scan.

Version: 4/3/2020 7 Statistical Plan  
A 28 patient phase II trial of NFV and concurrent chemo/RT with measurements of hypoxia by 
18EF-[ADDRESS_660103] day of chemo/RT+NFV to local or regional progression. 
Distant progression and patients free of locoregional control will be censored. The "pre and post -
NFV" measurements mentioned below, refer to samples obtained before and after a 7- 14 day run -
in period of NFV prior to chemo/RT. These pre/post -NFV changes are evaluated as "early change" 
predictors of treatment outcome. Hypotheses tested by [CONTACT_510511]:  
 
NFV given with chemo/RT will improve locoregional control (primary objective) will be tested 
by [CONTACT_510512] a historical result by [CONTACT_510513]. In a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_510481] (JCO 24:2098- 2104, 2006) in head and 
neck cancer, patients with hypoxic tumors who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy had a 3-
year loc oregiona8 control rate of 30%, while patients who received the hypoxia -activing pro- drug 
tirapazamine and concurrent chemoradiotherapy had a 3 -year loc oregional  rate of 95 %. Although 
the difference in local control was stunning, the sample sizes of these groups was very modest. 
Therefore,  we have powered our study conservatively, in order to detect a more modest treatment 
effect.  
 
Starting with this amendment, a total of 28 patients w ill be enrolled over 4 years, assuming a rate 
of 7 patients per year. To date, only 2 larynx cancer patient had been enrolled on this trial, so 4 
years of accrual will be needed to m eet the target sample size. We will then follow patients for an 
additional 6 months. There will be 85% power to detect a 30% absolute increase in 3- year 
locoregional control from a 40% rate for standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy to 70% for 
Nelfinavir and  concurrent chemoradiotherapy, using a 1- sided log rank test at a 5% type I error 
rate. Power calculated with SWOG software 
(http://www.swogstat.org/stat/public/one_nonparametric_survival.htm).   
 
NFV will reduce tumor hypoxia will be tested by [CONTACT_23992] p re and post -NFV hypoxia (i.e., 18EF-
5 uptake expressed as a tumor to muscle (TMR) ratio) by [CONTACT_15914]'s paired t -test. Transformation 
of the ratio may be necessary in order to meet the normality assumption of the t -test. Assuming an 
effect size ( δ), in units  of Std Dev of differences ( δ = |µd|/σd), of 1/2σ d, with 28 patients enrolled 
there is 8 2% power to detect the difference between pre/post -NFV values using a [ADDRESS_660104] at a stricter 5% type I error, used to control false positive conclusions in our correlative 
analyses.   
 
Baseli ne hypoxia, and glucose uptake  are predictive of treatment outcome will be tested by [CONTACT_510514].  Each variable will be tested in a univariate survival 
model to assess association with lo coregional control . The hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval 
and statistical significance will be determined for each variable.  Exploratory analyses will also 
evaluate differences between Nelfinavir responders and nonresponders. The definition of "NFV 
responder" requires greater knowledge about the distribution and variance of the baseline TMR. 
For example, a decrease in TMR to <1 .25 or percent decrease from baseline of >50% may be 
reasonable definitions. This exploratory analysis yields estimates of treatment outcomes within 
response groups.

Radiotherapy  
7.1.1 Hematologic toxiciti es 
Because Grade III hematologic toxicity occurs in approximately 50% of patients receiving 
combined chemoradiotherapy alone for head and neck  cancer and no hematologic toxicity was 
seen in phase I/II trials of nelfinavir in the setting of HIV patients  (34), the dose modifications for 
hematologic toxicity will be reduction in stan dard chemotherapy dose.   , as per the treating medical 
oncologist . Hematologic toxicities are expected and will not be followed as part of this trial. They 
will be managed by [CONTACT_78025].  
7.1.2 Non-hematologic toxicities  
Modifications in dose , frequency, and regimen of chemotherapy will be made for non- hematologic 
toxicity (such as hearing loss or rise in creatinin e to > 1.5x normal value). Nelfinavir will be held 
if during treatment, grade [ADDRESS_660105] be immediately held if during treatment, Grade >  III hepatic 
function impairment develops as characterized by:  
• Total bilirubin > 3x ULN (upper limit of normal of local lab; corresponds to approx 
2.7 mg/dl or 45.9 micromol /l) OR  
• AST/ALT > 5x ULN  
AST, ALT, and total bilirubin must be verified no later than one week after the first assessment, 
and weekly thereafter until resolution to grade < I. 
 
Dose administration must be held until recovery to grade <  I for all three hepatic parameters, at 
which time dosing of nelfinavir can resume.

Sponsor Reporting  
Notifying the FDA  
The study sponsor is required to report certain study events in an expedited 
fashion to the FDA.  These written notifications of adverse events are referred to 
as IND Safety Reports. The following describes the safety reporting  
requirements by [CONTACT_28822]:  
 
Events in correlation to the Investigational Agent:   
Report within 7 calendar days  
• The event occurred within 24 hours after the injection of FMISO.  
• Associated with the use of the study drug. 
• Unexpected.  
• Fatal or life -threatening.  
Report within 15 calendar days  
• The event occurred within 24 hours after the injection of FMISO.  
• Associated with the use of the study drug.  
• Unexpected.  
• Serious, but not fatal or life -threatening.  
     -OR- 
• A previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable 
but is later found to fit the criteria for reporting (reporting within 
15 calendar days from when event was deemed reportable).  
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that:  
• Suggest a si gnificant risk for human subjects including reports of 
mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
 
Notifying Participating Investigators  
  It is the responsibility of the study sponsor to notify all participating 
investigators, in a written IND safe ty report, of any adverse event associated with 
the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected, as well as any finding 
from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human 
subjects.  Additionally, sponsors are also required t o identify in IND safety 
reports all previous reports concerning similar adverse events and to analyze the 
significance of the current event in light of the previous reports. 
 
Additional Sponsor Reporting Requirements  
   Sponsors are also required to identify in IND safety reports all previous reports 
concerning similar adverse events and to analyze the significance of the current 
event in light of the previous reports.  
 
30 
Version: 4/3/2020        
        Other IRB Reportable Events:  
• Any a dverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the 
investigators brochure, protocol or informed consent form, or 
would prompt other action by [CONTACT_284581]. 
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential  
benefits of the research, in terms of severity or frequency, for 
example:  
• An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of 
response to treatment than initially expected.  
• Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is mor e severe, 
or more frequent than initially expected.  
• A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your 
research study is of no therapeutic value.  
• Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol. 
• A breach of confidentiality.  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to a research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under 
Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to 
remain on the study.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the 
complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB 
approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_341871], or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
• Exceptions:   A study except ion is a one time, intentional action or process that 
departs from the IRB and CTSRMC approved study protocol, intended for one 
occurrence. If the action disrupts the study progress, such that the study design or 
outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, or the action compromises the safety 
and welfare of study subjects, advance documented IRB and DSMC approval is 
required. For this in -house study with a sponsor monitor, approval will be obtained 
from the study sponsor (IND Support Office) prior to submitting  the exception 
request to the IRB and DSMC.  
• Deviations:   A study design deviation is a one time, unintentional action or 
process that departs from the IRB and CTSRMC approved study protocol,

and every six months thereafter for the life of the study. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_510490].  Three randomly selected 
patients or 10% of the total accrual, whichever is higher will be audited.  A written report is 
provided to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_344901].  Any rating less than satisfactory 
would warrant a repeat fu ll review at the time of the next scheduled audit or sooner, depending 
upon the extent of the deficiencies found.  Substantial protocol deviations will be reported to the 
Director of the Cancer Center and the Associate Director for Clinical Research for co nsideration 
of appropriate administrative action, such as suspending accrual to the protocol.

Protocol version number and date:     4.3 10/10/2023 
Research Question and Aims  
Specific Aim #1: Quantify 4DCT wrist biomarkers during resisted and unresisted tasks in healthy 
controls. Healthy controls without any history of wrist injury or diseases will be scanned using 4DCT during wrist movement to characteriz e gappi[INVESTIGATOR_52077], radiolunate, and radioscaphoid joints  
(“radiocarpal joint and scapholunate interval”) as well as at the scaphotrapezium, scaphotrapezoid, and trapeziotrapezoid joints  (“scaphotrapeziotrapezoid [STT] joint”) , as well as any other wrist joints captu red 
within the imaging fields -of-view (i.e., trapeziometacarpal [TMC] joint) . The existing device used to hold and 
guide subject’s wrists will be modified to provide resistance to movements. The scientific premise  for this aim 
is our pi[INVESTIGATOR_52078]21,[ADDRESS_55059] . 
Hypothesis: Sc apholunate distances and bilateral asymmetry will be greater in the resisted tasks as 
compared to the unresisted tasks in both male and female subjects. Secondarily, gappi[INVESTIGATOR_52079].  
Study Design and Methods

4DCT Imaging 
A research CT scanner (Siemens NAEOTOM Alpha) or another dual source CT scanner will be used for imaging. Two independent but identical x-ray tubes are mounted on a rotating gantry at a 94 degree offset , with respective 
detector arrays  opposing them . 4D (3D + time) CT imaging acquires high- temporal resolution , continuous or 
intermittent images over the width of the detector array in the superior -inferior direction. A bilateral static CT 
scan of the left and right wrist will first be performed. After that, four dynamic CT scans (4DCT) will be 
performed , two on each wrist, while patients are performing  one of three types of movements: 1) passive and  
active grip; 2) unresisted and resisted flexion-extension; 3) unresisted and resisted radial -ulnar deviation. The 
passive/unresisted movements account for one dynamic CT scan and the active/resisted movements account for the second dynamic CT scan, for each wrist, for a total of [ADDRESS_55060] perfusion  imaging . 
In this mode, imaging data of a moving joint are continuously acquired without table translation. Tw o seconds of

 data will be acquired for each movement (full cycles of open/closed active grip, flexion-extension, or radial -ulnar 
deviation). 
 
Image processin g 
Seventeen  image volumes will be reconstructed over the 2 second cycle using the commercially implemented 
dual-source cardiac reconstruction algorithm, resulting in a voxel dimension of 0.234 x 0.234 x 0.600 mm. 3D images of each of  the 17 volumes, which are evenly distributed (temporally) across the motion cycle , will be 
generated using volume rendering techniques (VRT) and 4D movies will be made using the scanner’s image processing workstation. All images will be stored  in DICOM format for determination of metrics a nd biomarkers. 
All of the DICOM volumes will be processed using Analyze Pro (Mayo Foundation of Medical Education and Research), Cloud Compare, Mesh Lab, and existing software previously developed by [CONTACT_52080] 
(Mathworks, Inc.) platforms. Three-dimensional bone shape analysis will be conducted using open- source 
ShapeWorks software developed at University of Utah ( https://www.sci.utah.edu/software/shapeworks.html
). 
   
Aim 1:  
Bilateral 4DCT scans will be performed on 30 healthy controls (15 males, 15 females) without any history of wrist injury or disease. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three groups of 10 subjects using stratified randomization to ensure equal distribution of sex in each group (5 males, 5 females) ; order of testing (unresisted 
and resisted) will be randomized within each group. 4DCT wrist data will be obtained while subjects in e ach 
group perform one of the following tasks  through a full range of motion, bilaterally: 1) passive and  active grip; 
2) unresiste d and resisted flexion-extension; and 3) unresist ed and resisted radial -ulnar deviation. Subjects in 
group [ADDRESS_55061] in neutral position. Auditory cues will be given to subjects in all groups via metronome to ensure the full motion cycle is performed in 2 seconds (length of each individual scan).  Resistance will be standardized across participants. The dynamic image sequence will be processed using 
existing software tools to obtain metrics quantifying the size and location of gappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (palmar or dorsal) at the scapholunate, radiolunate, and radioscaphoid joints as well as at the scaphotrapezium, scaphotrapezoid, and trapeziotrapezoid joints —as well as any other wrist joints that may be captured in the imaging field -of-view —
during the movement cycles.   
Expert Consensus  
addendum for protocol v4.3 (10/1 0/2023):  To select the most appropriate bone surfaces to include in the 
aforementioned analyses, a standardized three-dimensional rendering of a scaphotrapeziotrapezoid (STT) joint will be circulated to a panel of Mayo Clinic han d surgeons for an expert consensus using Microsoft Forms. The 
Form will be anonymous, and accessible only to those with a @mayo.edu e- mail address . The data being 
circulated do not contain original patient data and will be used for a technical decision in a software parameter.    addendum for protocol v4.2 (02/15/2023):  Due to a software malfunction during the scans for the first subject, 
only half of this subject’s dataset was retained.  A replacement subject will be recruited for this subject’s group (female, radial -ulnar deviation, unloaded first).

 HIPAA Identifiers and Protected Health Information (PHI)  
 
Protected health information is medical data that can be linked to the subject directly or through a combination of indirect identifiers.  
 
Recording i dentifiers (including a code) during the conduct of the study allows you to return to the medical 
record or data source to  delete duplicate subjects, check a missing or questionable entry, add new data points, 
etc. De -identified data is medical information that has been stripped of all  HIPAA identifier s so that it cannot be 
linked back to the subject. De- identified data is rarely  used in the conduct of a research study involving a chart 
review.   
 Review the list of subject identifiers below and, if applicable, check the box next to each HIPAA identifier being recorded at the time of data  collect ion or abstraction.  Identifiers apply to any subject enrolled in the 
study including Mayo Clinic staff, patients and their relatives and household members.   Internal  refers to the subject ’s identifier  that will be recorded at Mayo Clinic  by [CONTACT_5984] . 
External  refers to  the subject ’s identifier  that will be shared outside of Mayo Clinic.

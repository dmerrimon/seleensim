  Administrative Update #1: October 28, [ADDRESS_1122] 
This protocol for human research study is conducted according to [LOCATION_002] and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH] 
Guidelines), applicable government regulations (e.g. Title 45, Part 46 Code of Federal 
Regulations) and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology 
Imaging Network (ECOG-ACRIN) research policies and procedures. 
The objective of ACRIN 6698 study is to determine if diffusion weighted magnetic resonance 
imaging (DW-MRI) is effective for measuring breast tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment 
and if response measured by [CONTACT_1349]-based therapy is predictive of 
pathologic response. ACRIN [ADDRESS_1123] cancer neoadjuvant treatment trial. MRI is included in the I- SPY 2 protocol as a 
measurement method for tumor response, based on data from ACRIN 6657/I- SPY 1 showing 
higher predictive value of tumor volume by [CONTACT_1350], 
including clinical exam, mammography, and MRI (Hylton et al. 2012). Change in tumor volume, 
m
easured at multiple time points during treatment, is used to update the patient randomization 
schema as the trial progresses. A basic DWI acquisition was included as part of the I-SPY [ADDRESS_1124]-enhanced MRI ( DCE -MRI) measurements of tumor 
microvascular behavior. ACRIN [ADDRESS_1125] tumor response to treatment 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast is a sensitive method for assessing both tumor 
morphology and physiology. The most common technique for functional assessment of breast 
tissue is based on DCE-MRI and involves the serial acquisition of MR images before, and at 
multiple points following intravenous injection of gadolinium contrast agent. By [CONTACT_1351]-
MRI data to an appropriate pharmacokinetic model, DCE-MRI allows noninvasive, in vivo 
measurement of physiological parameters related to tissue perfusion, microvascular permeability, 
and extracellular/extravascular volume fraction. These measurements can be used to characterize 
tumor neovascularization and can detect changes in tumor vascular properties resulting from 
treatment. 
A number of recent studies have applied DCE-MRI to measure breast cancer response to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  These studies have evaluated MRI both for ability to detect and 
measure residual disease as well as ability to predict clinical or pathologic response endpoints 
and recurrence-free survival.  The majority of studies have been performed in small series of 
patients and have found changes in DCE-MRI parameters measured early in treatment to be 
associated with response outcomes. Johansen et al (2009) evaluated DCE-MRI for early 
prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and five year survival in patients 
with locally advanced breast cancer.  In this study, area under the curve (AUC) was calculated 
from DCE-MRI time-intensity curves and compared to clinical treatment response.  Relative 
CONFIDENTIAL 
ACRIN  6698  9 Ap ril 30, 2014 
  Administrative Update #1: October 28, 2013 
 signal intensity and AUC were reduced after only one cycle of NAC in patients with clinical 
treatment response.  In Ah- see et al (2007),  DCE-MRI was performed after two NAC cycles and 
correlated to final clinical and pathological response. DCE-MRI parameters included transfer 
constant (Ktrans), rate constant (k ep), leakage space (v e) ,maximum Gd-DTPA concentration (Max 
Gd), relative blood volume (rBV), and relative blood flow (rBF), with change in Ktrans found to 
be the best predictor of pathologic non-response. Yu et al found different results when 
investigating the value of using three parameters (tumor size, Ktrans, and k ep) obtained after the 
first treatment cycle in predicting the final clinical response following neoadjuvant anthracycline 
and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. In this small study (n=29), early tumor size change by 
[CONTACT_1352] a better response predictor than either Ktrans or k ep. In another small study (n=30), 
Martincich et al (2004) showed DCE -MRI performed best after two weeks of NAC showing that 
tumor volume reduction after two cycles had the strongest predictive value.  
DWI of the breast 
Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is an alternative MRI technique that can be used to measure 
the mobility of water molecules in vivo.  DWI is sensitive to tissue characteristics such as cell 
density, membrane permeability, and microstructure.  As such, DWI provides different but 
complementary biologic information about tumors and their response to treatment. In DWI, the 
MRI signal is sensitized to water diffusion using varying levels of a magnetic field gradient.  
DWI sequences are available on most current MRI scanners and are easily acquired as part of the 
patient exam in addition to standard DCE-MRI, with little time penalty.  DWI studies of the 
breast have shown decreased diffusivity in malignant breast lesions (Guo, Cai et al. 2002; Sinha, 
Lucas-Quesada et al. 2002; Woodhams, Matsunaga et al. 2005), primarily attributed to the 
increased cell density associated with breast tumors.  DWI has also been used to evaluate 
response to treatment.  Separate studies have found that the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 
in tumors increases in response to treatment earlier than detectable changes in tumor size or 
vascularity measured by [CONTACT_1353]-MRI (Chenever t, Stegman et al. 2000; Theilmann, Borders et al. 
2004; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1321], Gibbs et al. 2006; Sharma, Danishad et al. 2009) . The increase in ADC is thought 
to be due to cell death and necrosis, and may be a valuable early indicator of treatment efficacy. 
Indeed, a growing number of studies have found ADC measures to be predictive of breast cancer 
treatment outcome.  In separate studies, baseline ADC was lower in clinical responders versus 
non-respond ers (Iacconi, Giann elli et al. 2009; Park, Moon et al. 2010; Li, Cheng et al. 2011) , 
and change in ADC with treatment was significantly greater in responders (Iacconi, Giannelli et 
al. 2009; Park,  Moon et al. 2010), even after onl y the first cycle of chemotherapy (Sharma, 
Danishad et al. 2009; Li, Cheng et al. 2011) . In prediction of pathologic response, Fangberget et 
al further showed mid-treatment ADC was higher in patients who ultimately achieved a 
pathologic complete response (pCR) compared to those with residual disease (Fangberget, Nilsen 
et al. 2010) . On the other hand, ADC was not predictive of clinical response in  several other 
studies, whether measured prior to therapy or mid -treatment (Manton, Chaturvedi et al. 2006; 
Nilsen, Fangberget et a l. 2010; Woodhams, Kakita et al. 2010) . These disparate findings may be 
attributable to differences in DWI methods, analysis approaches, or study populations. Further 
larger studies are needed to validate the use of ADC as a predictive biomarker.  
Rationale for Selected Approach and Trial Design 
The objective of the proposed ACRIN [ADDRESS_1126] phase (I-SPY1/ACRIN 6657) about the effectiveness of DCE-MRI for assessing 
CONFIDENTIAL 
ACRIN  6698  10 Ap ril 30, 2014 
  Administrative Update #1: October 28, [ADDRESS_1127] cancers and their response to treatment. 
Integration with I-SPY 2 : Serial MRI exams are already required procedures for tumor volume 
measurement in I- SPY 2. Implementation of ACRIN [ADDRESS_1128], with 
minimal added risk, and with minimal added inconvenience to patients.  The timing of the four 
MRI exams (at baseline, early in the course of taxane-based therapy, between taxane-based and 
anthracycline regimens and between completion of neoadjuvant treatment and surgery) allows 
exploration of a number of important questions regarding the sequencing and effectiveness of 
neoadjuvant treatment.  Baseline information can be both prognostic and predictive of response, 
risk of recurrence and survival.  Early time point information has the potential to inform rapid 
assessment and modification to the treatment approach. Inter-regimen and pre-surgical 
measurements allow taxane-based and anthracycline-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_1322]; 
th
e pre-surgical measurement gives a final assessment of response and is useful for surgical 
planning as well.  Quantitative imaging performed at each of these time points and for all 
patients and experimental arms will provide a rich database for evaluating DWI. 
ACRIN 6698 Study activation and patient enrollment:  ACRIN [ADDRESS_1129] as part of I-SPY 2.  Twenty sites are 
activated for patient enrollment under I- SPY 2; all of these sites have met qualification 
requirements for basic imaging.  All patients accrued to I- SPY 2 are currently receiving MRI 
exams at the four protocol time points needed for ACRIN 6698.  ECOG-ACRIN and the 6698 
PI‘s institution (UCSF) are currently providing imaging core services to the I- SPY 2 trial; 
therefore procedures for image acquisition, transmittal, image analysis and reporting are already 
in place.  Additional requirements for ACRIN 6698 activation will include DWI qualification 
(submission of phantom and patient data using the advanced DWI protocol) and modification to 
the existing 6657 case report process to include DWI-specific documentation.  As with ACRIN 
6657/I- SPY 1, a single consent form will be used to enroll patients to ACRIN 6698/I- SPY 2.  
This will involve an appendix to the existing, approved, I- SPY [ADDRESS_1130] developed a process to amend the master protocol for the 
addition or removal of new candidate molecules. This same process will be used to amend the 
protocol for inclusion of ACRIN 6698 and for changes requested by [CONTACT_1354]. 
Patient benefits and safeguards: Consideration of patient benefits and safeguards has been 
integral to the development and implementation of I- SPY 2.  The I-SPY 2 advocate team works 
closely with the network of investigators to develop processes and informational materials 
describing the I- SPY 2 trial to patients, as well as its potential benefits and risks. Benefits and 
risks include those associated with randomization and experimental treatments, as well as tho se 
associated with MRI exams.  The requirement for multiple MRI exams has not been a barrier to 
accrual for either I- SPY 1 or I-SPY 2.  Since activation of ACRIN 6698 will require only an 
additional 10-15 minutes of scan time added to the required MRI exams, we do not anticipate 
any accrual barriers beyond those already encountered in I- SPY 2 in general. I- SPY 2 tracks the 
number and reasons for patients who decline and accept participation.

 Selection of pathologic complete response (pCR) as the primary endpoint: In the ACRIN [ADDRESS_1131] cancer 
subtypes (Esserman L. et al., 2011; Huober J. et al, 2010; Straver ME et al, 2010; Esserman L et 
al, in press).  pCR remains to be validated as a surrogate marker. With a lack of alternative short-
term endpoints, pCR as the endpoint for the primary analysis appears to be the best choice.  
However, the subtypes of all tumors will be known and potential alternative endpoints including 
residual cancer burden (RCB), Ki-[ADDRESS_1132] response to systemic therapy, 
their robustness and reproducibility, and their potential as therapeutic targets. Markers being 
evaluated included several associated with cell cycle checkpoints (Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, P21, 
P27), proliferation (MCM2, Ki-67, DNA index), angiogenesis (CD34) and apoptosis (Bcl- 2,

profiles (CGH, gene expression arrays) and tissue proteomic arrays are also being evaluated. 
Specifically, markers of genetic instability, cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation are 
being explored as predictors for anthracycline responsiveness, and markers of apoptotic potential 
as predictors for taxane responsiveness.

screened initially to identify those with high risk of recurrence according to the Mammaprint 70-
gene signature.  Low risk patients do not continue on the trial. Included patients are randomized 
to one of several sub-arms testing either paclitaxel alone or paclitaxel in combination with an 
investigational new drug, selected on the basis of phase I safety data and preliminary evidence of 
efficacy in the Her2+ or Her2- population. Following the taxol-based regimen, all patients 
continue to standard chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. As part of the

  To perform registrations on protocols for which you are a member of the 
Lead Group, you must have an equivalent ―Regist rar‖ role on the Lead 
Group roster. Role assignments are handled through the Groups in which 
you are a member. 
 To perform registrations to trials accessed via the CTSU mechanism (i.e., 
non-Lead Group registrations) you must have the role of Registrar on the 
CTS
U roster. Site and/or Data Administrators can manage CTSU roster 
roles via the new Site Roles maintenance feature under Regulatory 
Support System (RSS) on the CTSU members' web site. This will allow 
them to assign staff the "Registrar" role. 
 Once the patient is successfully registered to the OPEN system, sites will 
receive an e-mail notification from ECOG-ACRIN containing the 6698 
case number and calendar. 
Further instructional information is provided on the CTSU members' web site 
OPEN tab or within the OPEN URL. For any additional questions contact [CONTACT_1359] [PHONE_031] or ct [EMAIL_014] . 
7.[ADDRESS_1145].  Case report forms will be 
available on the web site through a series of links.  Each web form is separated 
into modules; each module must be completed sequentially in order for the 
internal programming to be accurate. The user selects the link to the appropriate 
form and enters data directly into the web-based form.  As information is entered 
into the web form application, various logic checks will be performed. These 
logic checks look for data that are missing, out of range, or in the wrong format 
(e.g. character data in a field requiring numeric responses).  Such errors will be 
detected as soon as the user attempts to either submit the form or move to the next 
data element. The user will not be able to finalize form transmission to the DMC 
until all data entered pass these logic checks.  Forms that are not completed in one 
sitting can still be submitted and completed at a later date.  The form will remain 
available on the web until the ―C omplete Form ‖ button is depressed. 
7.3.2 Once data entry of a form is complete, and the summary form is reviewed for 
completeness and accuracy, the investigator or the research staff presses the 
―C omplete Form ‖ button on the form summary screen and the data is transferred 
into the clinical database.  No further direct revision of the submitted data is 
allowed after this point.  E-mail confirmation of web data entry is automatically 
generated and sent to the site investigator or research associate listing all of the 
data generated and just submitted.  Should a problem occur during transmission 
and the e-mail confirmation of data submission is not received, the investigator or 
research associate should contact [CONTACT_1360].

  Administrative Update #1: October 28, 2013 
 7.3.3 If technical problems prevent access to the Data Center website, sites will be 
unable to enter data.  The site RA or investigator should notify the DMC if a 
problem with the Data Center is encountered.  All sites will be notified through an 
ECOG-ACRIN/CTSU broadcast message when access to the web data entry is 
unavailable and the estimated time when access will be restored.   The 
in
vestigative site should wait until access is restored to submit data. 
7.4 Data Security  
The registration and data collection system has a built-in security feature that encrypts all data 
for transmission in both directions, preventing unauthorized access to confidential participant 
information.  Access to the system is controlled by a sequence of identification codes and 
passwords. 
7.5 Electronic Data Management 
7.4.1 Data received from the web-based forms are electronically stamped with the date 
and time of receipt by [CONTACT_1361]; the data are then entered into the 
database.  A protocol-specific validation program is used to perform more 
extensive data checks for accuracy and completeness. Complementary validation 
programs are initiated at the Biostatistics and Data Management Center (BDMC) 
that are more comprehensive than those built into the web-based data entry 
screens.  The BDMC will run thorough cross-form validations, frequency 
di
stributions to look for unexpected patterns in data, and other summaries needed 
for study monitoring. The validation program generates a log of errors which is 
managed by [CONTACT_1362] (DM).  The program is frequently updated to 
incorporate exceptions to rules so that subsequent validity checks minimize the 
time DMC spends resolving problems. All communication with the participati ng 
sites is handled by [CONTACT_1363]. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_1146] (Z1 query letter) to the site RA or investigator specifying the 
problem and requesting clarification.  The DM updates the participant‘s data 
submission calendar with the Z1 due date to notify the site RA or investigator of 
when a response is expected.  The calendar will be updated upon receipt of the 
query response. 
7.6 Mi ssing and Delinquent Data Submission 
In addition to providing the investigator a data collection calendar for each case, the DMC 
periodically prompts institutions for timely submission of data through the use of a Forms Due 
Report. This report lists data items (e.g. forms, reports, and images) that are delinquent.  It is 
distributed at regular intervals via the electronic mail system to both the RA and the investigator 
at each site.  In addition to prompting clinicians to submit overdue data, the Forms Due Report 
helps to reconcile the DMC‘s case file with that of the RA and/or investigator.  Future Forms 
Due Reports may be sent on an as-needed basis in addition to past due reports.  The site 
investigator or RA may use the Forms Due and Future Due Reports as a case management tool.  
At any time, sites may run their own Forms Due Reports using the Site Operations Tool on the 
ACRIN website. 
7.7 Data Quality Assurance

  Administrative Update #1: October 28, 2013 9. IMAGI NG PROTOCOL 
9.1 Im aging Requirements and Parameters 
MRI Procedures: 
The breast MRI protocol includes a T2-weighted sequence, diffusion-weighted imaging 
sequence, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) series. The general imaging parameters are 
listed below.  DCE-MRI will be performed using a bilateral, 3D, fat-suppressed, T1-weighted 
gradient echo sequence with 80-[ADDRESS_1151]-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-
MRI) using a diffusion-weighted spin–echo echo planar imaging sequence. All vendors (GE, 
P
hilips, Siemens, Toshiba) offer commercial versions of diffusion-weighted sequences.  
Scanning will be performed in the axial orientation, with diffusion gradients applied in three 
orthogonal directions to measure isotropic ADC. The sequence will employ parallel imaging 
(r
eduction factor = 2) and fat suppression. The optimal technique for fat suppression (SPAIR, 
STIR, etc.) may vary between scanners. DWI will be performed using multiple b-values 
including 0, 100, 600 and 800 s/mm2. The general sequence parameters are given in Table 2 of 
the Imaging Manual. The maximum number of slices that can be acquired during a single 
acquisition is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 24-30 slices and coverage should be adjusted to keep the scan within a 
single acquisition to minimize scan time and motion artifacts. Total scan time for the DWI 
sequence should be under 5 minutes. 
DWI Reproducibility Scan 
Reproducibility of ADC measurements will be evaluated by [CONTACT_746] ―test -ret est‖ DWI scans 
for a subset of patients.  The test-retest procedure will be performed by [CONTACT_1364], prior to injection of contrast agent. Patients will be required to 
leave and return to the scan table between DWI scans. Full repositioning of the patient and 
retuning of the MRI system will simulate procedures of an entirely distinct MRI session.  Test-
retest scans will only be performed at one MRI visit.  It is preferable for this to be performed at 
baseline; however, test-retest can be performed at the early treatment time point (visit 2). 
Magnet Field Strength 
There is no theoretical dependence of ADC on field strength, although differences may arise 
related to field inhomogeneity effects, signal- to-noise and severity of artifacts.  To maximize 
accrual, both 1.5T and 3T field strengths will be allowed in 6698.  However, it will be required 
that all sequential exams for a given patient are performed on MRI systems with the same field 
strength and model (currently required in I- SPY-2).  Information regarding field strength will be 
collected and effects of field strength will be explored at the time of data analysis. 
Image Processing and Analysis 
Serial changes in ADC (in units mm2/s) measured from b = 0 and 800 s/mm2 DW images will be 
evaluated in the primary breast tumor over the course of treatment.   Sites will perform tumor 
ADC
 measurements according to the region- of-interest (ROI) measurement procedures described 
below.  ADC maps generated from b = 0, 800 s/mm2 DW images and screen capture images 
showing ROI placement will be submitted in addition to originally acquired data to ECOG-
CONFIDENTIAL 
ACRIN  6698 22 Ap ril 30, 2014 
  Administrative Update #1: October 28, [ADDRESS_1152] of 
the data required for transmission for each study case is given in Table 3 of the Imaging Manual. 
P
rimary tumor ADC measurement:  Whole tumor ROI methods will be used to calculate tumor 
ADC at each treatment time point. An ROI will be drawn over the largest solid tumor region, 
with tumor size and location determined from corresponding DCE-MRI images. Care should be 
taken to avoid necrotic, cystic, or adipose tissue by [CONTACT_1365] T1- and T2-weighted images 
and ADC maps in defining the ROIs.  Tumor ROIs will typi[INVESTIGATOR_1323], 
refl
ected by [CONTACT_1366]. A screen 
capture should be saved in each case to illustrate ROI placement for reporting.  ROIs will be 
adjusted to changing tumor size and shape in serial examinations (and positioned over the 
remaining area of solid tumor). 
Alternative tumor ADC metrics: Additional image processing and ADC analysis will be 
performed by [CONTACT_1367].  Traditional ADC 
measurement includes b=0 data in the fitted b-value range, although this increases the influence 
of flow and perfusion on ADC.  Alternatively, a minimum b-value of 100s/mm2 in the fitted b-
value range effectively removes perfusion signal (Bogner et al, 2009; Padhani et al, 2009) .  
Perfusion-sensitive ADC (calculated from b = 0 and 800 s/mm2 DW images) and perfusion-
insensitive ADC (calculated from b = 100 and 800 s/mm2 DW images) will be derived from each 
DWI dataset.  In addition, high-ADC cystic tissues that may exist in breast lesions prior to start 
of therapy may mask incremental therapy-induced necrosis within solid tumor.  Analysis of the 
low-ADC portion of the ADC histogram (e.g. ADC<1.5x10-3 mm2/s) is hypothesized to enhance 
sensitivity to therapy-induced alteration of solid tumor constituents of the lesion.  Low- ADC 
metrics will also be analyzed and evaluated. 
Site Qualification and Quality Control 
As part of the existing site qualification process for I-SPY 2, all sites are required to submit two 
breast MRI cases acquired using the DCE-MRI protocol described above.  Qualification scans 
are reviewed by [CONTACT_1368], as part of a 
core service agreement with I-SPY 2.  Approval of the qualification scans is required for I-SPY [ADDRESS_1153] meet specific quality criteria (e.g., artifacts, 
distortion, signal- to-noise ratio) for acceptance. Qualification must be performed for each 
scanner used for I-SPY [ADDRESS_1154] coil. 
Regular quality-control (QC) scans will be performed at each site using a standardized phantom 
to evaluate consistent DWI performance. DWI scans for submitted study cases will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_1369] a regular basis for ongoing QC, and if artifacts or inconsistencies 
are identified the site will be contact[CONTACT_1370].

  Administrative Update #1: October 28, 2013 9.2 Im ages Submission 
Each participating site is required to submit all acquired I-SPY 2 and ACRIN 6698 MRI imaging 
of study patients to the ACR Imaging Core laboratory via TRIAD- OA, which provides a 
validated, secure method of electronic image transmission. The TRIAD software anonymizes, 
encrypts, and applies lossless compression to the images before they are transferred to the 
ECOG-ACRIN image archive in Philadelphia, PA. Prompt submission of all image data is 
essential to ensure adequate quality control. Images should be transmitted along with an Imaging 
Transmittal Worksheet (ITW) that can be found on the ACRIN 6698  web site at: 
www.acrin.org/6698imagingmaterials.aspx . For  TRIAD support contact [CONTACT_1371] [EMAIL_015]  or by [CONTACT_648]: 215 -940-8820. 
Instructions for image submission and anonymization, as well as information regarding Quality 
Control of images, are available at www.acrin.org/6698_imagingmaterials.aspx . 
10. ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING 
Adverse events will be monitored and reported as documented in the I-SPY 2 protocol. However, 
adverse events reported for the imaging component of the trial, DW-MRI, will be monitored and 
managed by [CONTACT_1345]-ACRIN. 
10.1 Defi nition of Adverse Event 
An Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the study procedure. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory or physiological finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, 
regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution of 
unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures 
are considered to be AEs if the abnormality: 
 Results in study withdrawal  
 Is associated with a serious adverse event (SAE)  
 Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 Leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 Is considered by [CONTACT_1372]  
A pre-existing condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A pre-existing medical 
condition is defined as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or character of the medical condition 
worsens during the study period. At screening visit, any clinically significant 
findings/abnormalities should be recorded as a pre-existing condition. At the end of study, any 
new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an AE must be 
documented as AEs. 
10.2 Defi nition of Serious Adverse Event 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: 
 Results in death, or 
 Is life-threatening (at the time of the event), or 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324], or 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
 Requires intervention to prevent any of the above, per the investigator/sponsor.

  Administrative Update #1: October 28, 2013 Life-Threatening Adverse Event:  A life-threatening AE is any adverse event that places the 
study participant, in the clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at immediate risk of death. 
Medically-important events  are those based upon appropriate medical judgment that may not 
be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may 
jeopardize the participant and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes noted above. 
10.3 Ad verse Event Grading 
Grade denotes the severity of the AE. An AE is graded using the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0: 
 
1 – Mild  
 
2 – Moderate 
 
3 – Severe 
 
4 – Life-threatening or disabling 
 
5 – Fatal 
A c
opy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
10.4 Adverse Event Attribution 
Attribution is used to determine whether an AE is related to a study treatment or procedure.  
Attribution categories are: 
Definite: The AE is clearly related to a treatment or procedure  
Probable: The AE is likely related to a treatment or procedure  
Possible: T he AE may be related to a treatment or procedure  
Unlikely: The AE is likely unrelated to a treatment or procedure  
Unrelated: The AE is clearly not related to a treatment or procedure  
10.5 Exp ected and Unexpected Adverse Events 
AEs may be expected  or unexpected :  
 An expected AE  is one that is described in the protocol, the ICF, or the investigator‘s 
clinical brochure.  
 An unexpec
ted AE  is one that has not been described in the protocol, the ICF, or the 
investigator‘s clinical brochure. 
10.6 Exp ected DW-MRI Related Adverse Events 
The DW-MRI scan is performed without the use of an imaging agent. As such, there are no 
known expected AEs for DW-MRI. However, the following are expected AEs associated with 
MRI. 
10.6.1 Expected Adverse Events Associated With MRI 
 Anxiet y/stre ss; 
 Claustrophobia; 
 Discomfort. 
Because of the powerful magnetic force of the MRI scanner, the patient may be 
ineligible to participate in the study if she has: 
 Metallic or other surgical implants (for example: pacemaker, heart valves, 
aneurysm clips, metal plates or pi[INVESTIGATOR_1325]); 
 Metal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1326](s) or other body part(s).

  Administrative Update #1: October 28, [ADDRESS_1155] (study visit and/or telephone) with the study participant, the investigator or 
investigator-designee must seek information on AEs through discussion and, as appropriate, by 
[CONTACT_1373]. All expected (Section 10.6) and unexpected AEs considered possibly, probably, or 
definitely related with the severity level of grades 3, 4, 5 that occur within 30 days of the DW-
MRI will be documented and reported in the study participant‘s chart and AE CRFs to ensure 
compliance with the reporting requirements of ECOG-ACRIN and the National Cancer 
Institute‘s (NCI) Clinical Trials Network.  See Table A below for additional details. Local IRBs 
and/or institutions may stipulate additional AEs reporting based upon their review of the 
protocol. 
IMPORTANT:  Recording of AEs on source document does not constitute reporting. Please 
ensure that AEs are documented in the participant‘s chart and an AE CRF in order to satisfy 
routine reporting requirements; AEs and SAEs are reported to ECOG-ACRIN and NCI per 
protocol-specific reporting requirements. 
All unresolved AEs should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
participant is lost to follow-up, or the AEs are otherwise explained. Any death or AE occurring at 
any time after a participant has discontinued or terminated study participation that may be 
reasonably related to the study imaging effect should be reported. 
10.8 Reporti ng of Adverse Events 
Prompt reporting of AEs is the responsibility of each investigator, clinical RA, and/or nurse 
engaged in clinical research. Anyone uncertain about whether a particular AE should be reported 
should contact [CONTACT_1375] ([PHONE_033]  for assistance. However, an AE report 
should be submitted if there is a reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1327]. 
All unresolved AEs should be followed by [CONTACT_1376], 
otherwise explained, or the site has documented due diligence in attempting to procure the 
requisite medical records. 
Any death or AE occurring at any time after a participant has discontinued or terminated study 
participation that may be reasonably related  to the DW-MRI should be reported. 
Assignm
ent of grades (severity level) and attribution for each AE is to be completed at the 
site by [CONTACT_1377]. 
10.9 Rou tine AE Reporting Process 
Routine reporting  is defined as documentation and reporting of AEs on source documents and 
the AE case report form (CRF) for preparation of a report for DSMC review, quarterly reports to 
CDUS, and the final study report. All AEs must  be reported in routine study data submissions 
per the I-SPY 2 TRIAL protocol and Manual of Operations and Procedures (MOP). Routine 
study data submissions also are required when AEs are reported through the CTEP 
Adverse Event Reporting System ( CTEP - AERS).  
Exp
edited reporting  is defined as immediate notification of NCI and ACRIN per Section 10.8. 
Routine reporting requirements also apply as noted in the I-SPY 2 TRIAL protocol and MOP.

15. ST ATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
15.1 Study D esign and Endpoints 
The study design is outlined in the schema. Patients who remain on study following the 
screening phase will be assigned to one of two major arms based upon their Her2 status.  Within 
the two major arms, patients will be randomized to one of several sub-arms testing either 
paclitaxel alone or paclitaxel in combination with an investigational new drug, selected on the 
basis of phase I safety data and preliminary evidence of efficacy in the Her2+ or Her2- 
population (regimen A).  Following regimen A, all patients will continue standard chemotherapy 
with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (regimen B).  MRI and tissue-based biomarkers will be 
measured at four time points: 1) baseline, 2) after 3 weeks of regimen A, 3) following 
completion of regimen A and 4) at the end of regimen B, prior to surgery. With the

15.2 Specific Aims and Analysis Plans 
For Aims 1 to 3, the change in tumor ADC will be calculated as the difference in tumor ADC 
values from the specific treatment time point (T2, T3, or T4) to the baseline (T1) whereas the 
change
 in tumor volume or peak SER will be calculated as the difference in the marker values 
from the specific treatment time point (T2, T3, or T4) to the baseline (T1 ). The outcome will be

ACRIN 6698 32 Ap ril 30, 2014 
  Administrative Update #1: October 28, 2013 defined as a binary variable indicating either a pathologic complete responder (pCR) or a non-
responder. 
15.2.1 Primary Aims 
Aim 1: To determine if the change in tumor ADC value measured from 
each treatment time point to baseline is predictive of pathologic complete 
response. 
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve will be constructed for the 
difference in tumor ADC value measured from each treatment time point to 
baseline and corresponding area under the ROC curve (AUC) will be estimated. 
15.2.2
 Secondary Aims 
Aim 2: To determine if the combined measurement of change in tumor 
AD
C value, change in tumor volume and change in peak SER is predictive 
of pathologic complete response. 
We will use a data splitting approach where 60% of randomly selected 
observations will be selected as the training data set, and the rest of observations 
as the test data set.  First, we will fit a multivariate logistic regression model 
using the training data set. In the model, a binary variable for pCR will be 
treated as the outcome variable and three markers (change in tumor ADC, 
change in tumor volume, and change in peak SER) as predictors. Then, we will 
derive a linear function of the three markers where the weight of each marker 
will be its corresponding estimated logistic regression coefficient. We will then 
apply the obtained linear function from the training set to the test data set and 
calculate the linear scores of the three markers. The ROC curve for the derived 
linear score and its corresponding AUC will be estimated. 
Similarly, we will estimate the AUC for the DCE MRI markers (changes in 
tumor volume and peak SER), and assess whether the AUC of the three 
combined markers yields a higher AUC than the AUC of the DCE-MRI markers 
alone.  
Aim 3: To investigate the relative effectiveness of the individual 
measurements, change in tumor ADC value, change in tumor volume, and 
change in peak signal enhancement ratio (SER) for predicting pathologic 
complete response in experimental treatment arms. 
The ROC curve and its corresponding AUC for each individual marker will be 
estimated and compared in each experimental treatment arms. The sample size 
for each arm may vary between 20 – 120 patients. The significant differences in 
the three AUCs will be tested by [CONTACT_941] Z statistics (Hanley & McNeil, 1983) with 
adjustment of correlation between the AUCs. 
Aim 4: To assess the test-retest repeatability of ADC metrics applied to 
breast tumor.  
The repeatability coefficient ( RC) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be 
estimated for each ADC metric described in Section 9.1. 
T
he repeatability coefficient ( RC) will be estimated by 2.[ADDRESS_1166] deviation (wSD). The one-way ANOVA model will be fitted to 
obtain the within-subject means of squares (WM S) where wSD can be

  Administrative Update #1: October 28, 2013 calculated by [CONTACT_1387]. Next, the 95% confidence interval 
for RC (RC LL, RCUL) will be derived by [CONTACT_1388]-squared 
distribution for the WMS. 
15.3 Sample  Size/Accrual Rate 
The planned sample size is 404 participants at twenty institutions, to be accrued over 2 years 
(
April, 2012 to March, 2014). Accrual rate is approximately 17 participants per month. 
Patients who enroll on the ACRIN 6698 study will be recruited and enrolled from the ongoing I-
SPY 2 TRIAL study.  I-SPY 2 opened in March 2010 and will continue to enroll patients over a 
period of 3-4 years at 20 sites. I-SPY 2 follows an adaptive Phase II design with patients enrolled 
on up to 5 experimental arms. It is not known a priori how many patients will be enrolled in each 
experimental arm; the number enrolled can vary between a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 
120. The ACRIN 6698 sample size estimate is based on enrollment of 404 consecutive patients 
fr
om any of the five experimental arms. 
15.4 Power Consideration/Stratification Factor 
 
The sample size projections are designed to achieve adequate power for 
analyzing the early treatment time point measurement under Primary Aim 1. The 
number of subjects will be chosen to ensure 90% power to test whether the 
change in tumor ADC value measured from baseline to the early treatment time 
poi
nt is predictive of pathologic complete response. 
Specifically, the sample size is calculated to detect a difference of 0.[ADDRESS_1167] at a significance level of 0.05. It is 
assumed that the number of pCR non-responders is approximately 2.7 times 
greater than the number of complete responders based on the ACRIN 6657 study.  
Then, a total of 160 patients are required (43 responders and 117 non-responders) 
as shown in the table below. 
We assume 20% of the cases accrued do not provide usable data for the analysis, 
for example, having missing MRI scans out of four MRI scans per participant, 
and assume that there is a 45% loss rate due to patients who are screened but do 
not
 proceed to the treatment phase of I-SPY 2. Additionally, 10% drop out rate is 
expected.  Therefore, we will enroll approximately 404 participants after 
acc
ounting for the above three conditions. 
Computations were carried out using PASS (Hinze J. [2008] PASS, NCSS, LLC, 
Kaysville, Utah).

markers.  It is assumed that 17 subjects are responders and 47 subjects are non-
responders; and the correlation between the two linear scores (linear score for the 
DCE-MRI markers vs. linear score for the three combined markers) is assumed to 
be 0.35 for the responders and 0.69 for the non-responders. Under the above 
assumptions, the sample size of 64 patients will achieve 60% power to detect a 
difference of 0.[ADDRESS_1169] reproducibility of ADC: 
We calculate the sample size required to ensure that the upper bound 95% 
confidence interval of the RC (RCUL)   remains below the pre-defined 
biologically significant change in ADC value of 0.3 (x10-3) mm2/sec given 
potential observed RCs (Barnhart, Barboriak et al. 2009). 
Estimations are based on the following assumptions: 
 Repli cation per subject: 2 
 Mi nimum change in ADC metric value that is of interest: 0.3 (x10-3) mm2/sec 
 Expect ed (potentially observed) RC: 0.19, 0.2, 0.21.

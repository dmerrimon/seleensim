3. INTRODUCTION  
 
During the transition into school, children encounter a range of developmental challenges 
which impose significant social and cognitive demands. Emotional and behavior al self -
regulation is critical to successful school adjustment. This transition may be pa rticularly 
challenging for children with emerging developmental delays or disabilities (e.g., autism, 
intellectual disability) who experience more self -regulation difficulties and problem behavior s 
than typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] -developi[INVESTIGATOR_68243]. Early intervention is critical to minimize negative outcomes, 
and there is evidence to suggest that consistent, supportive parenting practices is effective for 
children with developmental disabilities (DD) , particularly for promoting self -regulatory abilities 
and managing probl em behavior s (Roberts, Mazzucchelli, Studman, Sanders, 2006). Given the 
importance of regulatory skills during the transition to school, parenting may be an early, 
malleable target to support school readiness and improve behavior al, emotional, and cognitiv e 
outcomes, especially for children with DD.  
 
Parenting management training (PMT) programs have been implemented extensively with 
parents of typi[INVESTIGATOR_259411] (Kazdin, 2005). Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_259412]  (KEEP) is a PMT  Oregon  
model originally developed for supporting parents of foster children. It has been consistently 
effective in improving child and parent ou tcomes, including reduced behavior  problems and 
associated parenting stress (Chamberlain & Reid, 1987; Chamberlain, 2002; Chamberlain, 2008; 
Price & Walsh, 2015; Price, Roesch, & Walsh, 2012).  Filming Interaction s to Nurture 
Development (FIND) is a video -coaching method which aims to increase the frequency of 
developmentally supportive interactions by [CONTACT_259439] s. It has been shown useful in enhancing child -supportive parenting which 
consequently reduce s children’s problem behavior s and improves parenting stress and 
competence (Fisher et al., 2016).  Although PMT programs are well -validated, there is increasing 
interest in integrating traditional PMT models, which can focus on skill deficits, with models 
that emphasize and potentiate parenting strengths and capabilities.   
 
The Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_259410] – Preschool (KEEP -P) study introduced a variation 
of the KEEP intervention model which included the strengths -based video -coaching methods of 
FIND. With p articipating families  randomly assigned to either the KEEP -P program  or the KEEP -P 
+ FIND (KEEP -P+) program, the study  was a randomized control trial that compare d the efficacy 
of the two varied models of KEEP in children with DD . The study used  a two -group 
(experimental and active control) mixed design that examine d repeated measures, but was not 
factorial.  Institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained from the University of Oregon , 
and the trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
 
 
4. STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
 
Primary Objective  
 
The primary objective of the study is to  examine and compare the efficacy of a traditional KEEP 
parenting management training intervention (KEEP -P) with a variation of the KEEP model ( KEEP -
P+) on a range of both child and parent outcomes, specifically in families with children with DD. 
We hypothesize that the addition of the video coaching in the KEEP -P+ condition will result in 
significantly enhanced socioemotional  functioning, executive functi on (EF), and longer -term 
educational outcomes (i.e., KEEP -P+ > KEEP -P). 
 
As the title describes, the project began as a study on foster preschoolers. However, due to a 
number of practical and logistical problems that led to low recruitment numbers, the 
investigative team added recruitment through early intervention/early childhood special 
education service providers  with approval from NICHD . The EI/ECSE population has 
considerable overlap with the foster care population in terms of high risk for poor outcom es 
and negative life course trajectories. While analyzing the study’s results, the investigative team 
found that 1) The EI/ECSE sample made up the vast majority of the total sample  and 2) The 
effects and baseline scores differed greatly between EI/ECSE and  DHS. Because of this, it was 
decided that the published results from  this study would be of the  EI/ECSE participants only.  
 
Secondary Objective  
 
The secondary objective of the study is to examin e associations between sociodemographic 
covariates and change -over -time outcome variables , including the [ADDRESS_315304] -intervention data has been 
analyzed.  
 
 
 
5. STUDY DESIGN  
 
Conceptual Model. The conceptual model for the proposed research is shown in Figure 1 
(below ). This model has guided our program of research involving foster preschoolers for over a 
decade. The foundation of the model (replicated in many of our pr ior experimental studies) is 
that parenting is a central mediating mechanism of interventions to improve child adjustment. 
Specifically, the parenting variables that have proven most malleable and most strongly 
associated with child outcomes include the us e of positive reinforcement techniques and non -
harsh discipline and reducing parent stress associated with child behavior problems. As 
illustrated in Figure 1, we hypothesize that KEEP -P and KEEP -P+ will produce significant main 
effects in terms of immedia te and longer -term child outcomes in placement stability and 
behavioral adjustment. We hypothesize that these intervention effects will be mediated 
through targeted parenting variables. We further hypothesize that additional direct 
intervention effects wil l be observed for the KEEP -P+ children regarding socioemotional 
adjustment, early literacy, and EF, which will in turn mediate longer -term educational 
outcomes. The conceptual model also includes a number of observed child characteristics as 
control variab les, including child demographics, and intervention dosage and fidelity as well as 
foster placement history from Child Welfare records, which might influence intervention 
effects.  
 
 
Data Collection Procedures.  Interviews were  conducted at the University of Oregon in the 
Stress Neurobiology and Prevention (SNAP) assessment space. Caregivers and their children 
completed a 90 minutes assessment prior to the start of any intervention activities [Time 1 (T1)] 
and following the intervention [Time 2 (T2)]. Child ren completed standardized tests and various 
tabletop tasks , and parents completed semi -structured interviews and questionnaires.  
Caregivers were compensat ed $[ADDRESS_315305] of data collection . Families also 
receive d assistance with transportation and childcare costs to facilitate participation.  
 
 
Caregiver and child measures.  The assessment strategy used  a multiagent, multimethod 
approach aimed at minimizing measurement bias and error. To measure immediate and longe r-
term child outcomes, we assess ed attachment behavior , internalizing and externalizing 
symptoms , behavioral and socioemotional adjustment , and cognitive  function. For parenting 

outcomes, we measure d parenting self -efficacy , parenting stress , and m indful ness in  parenting . 
Control variables (e.g., demographics and intervention fidelity/dosage) was assessed. The 
measures were selected based on their psychometric properties, utility in defining the 
constructs of interest, and relevance to the proposed study. A ll measures have acceptable 
reliability and validity information on psychometric characteristics.

KEEP -P: caregiver support groups.  The KEEP -P caregiver  support groups employ a manualized 
12-session, weekly curriculum for foster , kinship , and biological  caregivers. Curriculum topi[INVESTIGATOR_259413]. 
The primary focus is on increasing the use of positive reinforcement and the consistent use of 
non-harsh discipline methods, such as redirection and brief timeouts. In addition, strategies for 
avoiding power struggles, reducing caregiver stress, and improving success at school are 
included. Each weekly [ADDRESS_315306]: Parent Daily Report. 
The facilitator can then discuss  these data at the next group meeting as a means for illustrating 
concepts and providing support.  In prior research on the KEEP program for older childre n, as 
well as in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_259414] -P, these activities were not overly burdensome for 
caregivers, as indicated by [CONTACT_259440].  
The curriculum is designed to be delivered by [CONTACT_10070] -trained and supervised paraprofe ssionals, 
who videotape each group meeting and receive weekly supervision to ensure that the program 
is delivered as intended (see section on fidelity below). Our prior research demonstrating the 
efficacy of the original KEEP program also employed paraprof essionals. Although others have 
questioned the use of paraprofessional intervention staff, we have found it to be an efficient 
and effective way to deliver services in this population that increase s the scalability of an 
intervention.  
 
KEEP -P + FIND : caregiver support groups plus  video coaching component.  The KEEP -P + FIND  
condition was called KEEP -Video for our project participants. This group complete d the KEEP -P 
curriculum as above, with the addition of information about recent findings in early brain 
development and the elements of the FIND video coaching program. The FIND video coaching 
program was designed for parents and other caregivers of high -risk children. The program 
employs video of caregivers’ natural interactions with their child to show ways that they are 
supporting children’s healthy development.  It is a simple and practical approach that 
emphasizes caregivers’ strengths and capabilities.  The video coaching program has been 
implemented in both individual and group settings. It begins with video recordings of a 
caregiver and child in their home or other natural setting. The film is carefully edited to show 
brief clips in which the caregiver  is engaged in developmentally supportive interactions with the 
child. At a group coaching session, a Coach reviews the edited clips in detail with the caregivers.  
To cover the core concepts and elements, the Coach will review [ADDRESS_315307] Center on the Developi[INVESTIGATOR_259415] “Serve and Return” and toxic stress. The KEEP -P + FIND  component utilizes serve 
and return as the framework within which developmentally supportive interac tions are 
identified. A serve occurs when a child initiates an interaction using words or gestures, or by 
[CONTACT_259441]. The serve is returned when the caregiver 
notices and responds. Within this context, 5 specific eleme nts of serve and return are 
emphasized, with an element introduced within the KEEP -P session, followed by a coaching 
session showing video clips from each member of the group. The five FIND elements are:  
• Sharing the Child’s Focus:  This occurs when the adul t identifies or notices what the child 
is interested in and then puts his/her attention there as well.  
• Supporting and Encouraging:  Having noticed the child’s focus of attention, the adult 
responds in a supportive and/or positive way, adding his or her own reaction by [CONTACT_259442]/she is seeing, doing, or 
feeling.   
• Naming:  An extension of the Supporting and Encouraging element, Naming occurs when 
the caregiver uses words to label what the child is seeing , doing, or feeling.   
• Back & Forth Interaction:  After the child has “served” and the caregiver noticed and 
returned the serve by [CONTACT_259443], the interaction continues. 
The interaction goes back and forth between child and adult, w ith the adult waiting for 
the child’s further initiations.  
• Endings and Beginnings:  This occurs w hen a Back and Forth interaction between child 
and caregiver ends and a new serve and return interaction begins. The end of the back 
and forth interaction is si gnaled by [CONTACT_259444][INVESTIGATOR_259416] (e.g., the book is finished).   
Both the KEEP -P and KEEP -P + FIND  curriculums are designed to be delivered by [CONTACT_10070] -trained 
and supervised paraprofessionals, who videotape each group meetin g and receive weekly 
supervision to ensure that the program is delivered as intended. Our prior research 
demonstrating the efficacy of the original KEEP program also employed paraprofessionals. 
Although others have questioned the use of paraprofessional in tervention staff, we have found 
it to be an efficient and effective way to deliver services in this population that increase s the 
scalability of an intervention.  
 
Fidelity Monitoring and Dosage. All caregiver groups are videotaped and coded for fidelity. 
Caregiver group fidelity were  measured using the Facilitator Adherence Ratings. This 14 -item 
rating scale measures adherence to fidelity on three domains: content (e.g., “ caregivers  were 
encouraged to/or used a behavioral management system”), process (e.g. , “The facilitator did 
not make critical or corrective comments”), and structure (e.g., “Facilitator managed meeting 
time well”). Research assistants, who were  trained in the intervention model and did not 
participate in the delivery of the intervention, c omplete d the ratings evaluating adherence on a 
5-point scale (1 [ not at all ] to 5 [ very much ]), resulting in a summary score for each domain. We 
also assess ed dosage via measures of participation in intervention activities. We track ed session 
attendance and record ed when missed sessions are delivered via home visit. Fidelity and 
dosage measures w ere included in analyses of intervention effectiveness.  
 
 
7. SAMP LE SIZE JUSTIFICATION  
 
To investigate the extent to which outcome measures of interest changed over time  (one of the 
primary objective s of the study ) we will use repeated measures ANOVAS with time and 
time*condition (KEEP -P vs. KEEP -P+).  
To justify the sa mple size of the present study, we  ran an F-test: Repeated Measures, within -
between interaction for ANOVA using G *Power to compute power and sample size. Time is the 
within -subjects variable , and the intervention condition (KEEP -P vs. KEEP -P+) is the betwe en-
subjects variable. Partial eta squared is the effect size measure for the interaction between the 
within - and between -subjects variables. We assume a medium effect size here which means 
partial eta squared = .06, alpha err or prob ability  = 0.05, power = 95%, nu mber  of groups = 2 , 
number of measurements = 2 , total sample size = 54.  
There is a 95 % chance of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis of no significant effect of the 
interaction with 27 families in the KEEP -P condition and 27 families in the KEEP -P+ condition for 
a total of 54 families. Therefore, our sample size of n=[ADDRESS_315308] the analyses.  
 
8. DEFINITION OF ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
 
Analysis Sets/Populations/Subgroups  
 
175 caregivers  with children were recruited  through Early Childhood CARES, an EI/ECSE 
provider in Lane County, Oregon , and randomly assigned to KEEP -P (n = 87) or KEEP -V (n = 88). 
To be eligible for study participation, the child had to be identified as being at risk or with a 
documented development al disability.  
 
9. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
General  
 
All data will be summarized by [CONTACT_65237]. For continuous  variables, sample maximum, 
minimum, median, mean, and standard deviation will be reported. For categorical variables, 
counts and percen tages will be reported. A  significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_315309]. If missing data was found shortly after the visit and the informat ion could be clarified or 
collected , (e.g. missing item on a survey) research team members called the caregiver  to ask for 
the information. In order to maximize our power to detect effects in scale measures , we 
interpolated cases with at least 80% of data available in a given subscale or total score to create 
a useable score.   
 
Statistical Tests  
 
All families who attended at least one group were included in analyses.  We first investigated 
the extent to which outcome measures of interest changed over time u sing repeated measures 
ANOVAS with time and time*condition (KEEP -P vs. KEEP -P+) conditions. For outcomes with 
either time or time*condition effects, we conducted follow -up analyses investigating the 
influence of condition and intervention dosage (i.e., % o f groups attended).  
 
Covariates investigated included caregiver level (i.e. caregiver education, family income) and 
child level (i.e. child age, child gender) variables. Chi -square tests (child gender) and 
independent sample t -tests (caregiver education, f amily income, child age) were run to 
determine the presence of group differences at baseline. The presence of either significant 
group differences or associations between a covariate and change -over -time resulted in the 
covariate being included in all subs equent analyses.  
 
One-way ANOVAs were then conducted between condition and covariate measures on change 
scores of outcome measures for outcome constructs that were of primary interest to the theory 
of change and that evidenced change over time, we also con ducted exploratory subscale 
analyses (i.e., Parent Stress, Child Mental Health and Behavior , Child Development). This 
analytic approach was taken to demonstrate transparency of results across all measures 
collected.  
 
Linear regressions were conducted to ex amine predictors of change -over -time in all 12 
variables established to change in the main analysis. Variables included as predictors included 
child age, child sex, group assignment (KEEP -P or KEEP -P+), and intervention dosage (% groups 
attended).

12. Data & Results   
 
Sociodemographic descriptives  
Caregivers were predominantly female (n = 151, 91.0%), versus male (n = 15, 9.0%) at an 
average age of 33.58 years (SD = 7.07; range 20 - 63) years. Nearly all caregivers reported being 
a child’s biological parent (161, 97.0%) with other caregivers being foster or adoptive parents 
(5, 3.0%).  
  
The sample primarily included children and caregivers of Euro -American/Caucasian/White 
race/ethnicity (n = 135, 77.1% children and n = 121, 69.1% car egivers). The next most 
commonly reported race/ethnic category Mixed Race/Ethnicity, (n = 17, 9.2% children, n = 34, 
16.9% caregivers) and all other race/ethnic categories represented < 10% of the sample.  
  
Primary caregiver education was coded on a contin uous 14 -point scale with responses ranging 
from 4: partial high school to 14: graduate degree. The median education level was a partial 4 -
year college degree (at least 1 year).  
  
Gross annual household income was asked on a continuous 12 -point scale, with response 
ranging from less than $4,999 to more than 100,000. The median annual household income was 
$30,000 -39,000. All families reported receiving social assistance.  
 
Participating children were predominantly male (n = 124, 74.7%) with an average age of 47.70 
months (SD = 10.48, range 28 – 70 months). The majority of caregivers reported being the 
child’s biological parent (n = 161, 97.0%) with other caregivers being fos ter or adoptive parents 
(n = 5, 3.0%).  
 
 
Attendance  
Out of the [ADDRESS_315312] one session. This included of 86.2% KEEP -P (n = 
75) and 88.6% KEEP -V (n = 78), with no significant differences between groups [c2 (1,175) = .24, 
p = .63]. A verage group attendance was 77.8%. 20.3% of families completed 8 -49% of sessions; 
17.0% of families completed 50 -89% of sessions and 62.7% of families completed 90 -100% of 
sessions.  
 
Change over time   
Repeated measures ANOVAS of collected data generally i ndicated a main effect of 
intervention, such that improvements in parent, child, and family function were observed over 
time for those assigned to the KEEP intervention. However minimal differences between KEEP -
P and KEEP -V groups were observed. (See Table  1 for all means and Table 2 for inferential 
statistics).  
In the Parenting domain, scores on the parent stress index decreased over time [F(1,125) 
= 26.81, p < .001] and scores on the parenting sense of competence [F(1,122) = 10.21, p < .01] 
and IEMP [F(1, 126) = 5.29, p < .05] both increased over time. On the parenting sense of 
competence, there was also a significant Time*Group effect (F(1,122) -5.82, p <.05) such that 
parents in the KEEP -P group reported greater gains over time than parents in the KEEP -V group. 
There were no observed changes in either the ADRY or the PI[INVESTIGATOR_259417].  
In the Child Mental Health and Behavior domain, parent -reported scores on all domains 
of child function significantly improved including the CBCL internalizing scale , CBCL 
internalizing scale, PDR, and PKBS (stats?). No Time*Group effects were observed.  
In the Child Cognitive Function and Development domain, children exhibited fewer 
development problems, as measured on the Ages and Stages Questionnaire and improved 
executive function on 4 of 6 measures. In particular, children exhibited better performance on the 
DCCS, Bear -Dragon Task, KRISP, and Silly Animal Categories Tasks, with no change on the 
Delay Choice Paradigm  or Spin the Pots measures.  
 
Multivariate analyses  
Covariate analyses indicated minimal sociodemographic covariates between groups, with 
the exception of child age [t(113) = 2.19, p = .03]. Children were older in the Keep -P group 
[M(SD) = 48.87 (10.96) months] compared to the Keep -V group [M(SD) = 44.63 ( 9.77) 
months]. For all other variables of interest including child gender, caregiver education, and 
household income, there were no significant differences between groups (p>.05).  
 Analyses examining associations between sociodemographic covariates and cha nge-
over-time outcome variables indicated that child sex was associated with PDR Mean Stressful 
Behaviors change -over-time (t(103) = 2.89, p = .005) with female children more likely to exhibit 
reduced stressful behavior s over time [M(SD): females – 4.92 (5 .07) ; males -2.03 (3.91)]. Child 
age was associated with PI[INVESTIGATOR_259418] (r  = - .20, p = .045). There were no other 
associations between sociodemographi c covariates of interest and any outcome variables (for full 
list, see Table 1).  Based on these analyses, child age and sex were included as covariates in 
subsequent analyses.  
 Linear regressions were conducted to examine predictors of change -over-time in  all 12 
variables established to change in the repeated measures ANOVAS. Variables included as 
predictors included child age, child sex, group assignment (KEEP -P or KEEP -V), and 
intervention dosage (% groups attended). Results are presented in Table 3. Acr oss the [ADDRESS_315313] (IRB) Protocol Documents

   Statement of Informed Consent: Caseworker KEEP-P project 	
  The foster family of a child on your caseload has been invited to be in a research project at the University of Oregon Prevention Science Institute called Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_259433] – Preschoolers (KEEP-P); the child will participate in parent-child interactions and developmental assessments. The KEEP-P project’s main goal is to find out what type of services can be helpful for foster families, particularly in reducing stress for foster parents and young foster children and in improving placement stability. This study is being conducted by [CONTACT_259450], PhD from the University of Oregon. [CONTACT_79783] is also affiliated with Oregon Social Learning Center (OSLC) and OSLC Community Programs. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is funding this project (grant #1R01HD0757516-01). 	
  Do you want this child to participate? As this child’s caseworker, you are part of the decision process for this child to be in the project. The child’s foster parent(s) will also provide consent. Before you decide, you need to know the risks and benefits for this child. You should also know what we would ask him/her to do. Please take your time to read this form. The form explains the project. A staff member will also explain the project and answer your questions. 	
  If you allow this child to be in this project, you will sign this consent form. When you sign the consent form, you “give consent.” This means that you agree to allow this child to be in the project. It also means that you understand what we will ask him/her to do. Please review this form and the consent form carefully. Staff will answer any questions you have before you sign this form. 	
  What is the purpose of the project? KEEP-P is a new program being evaluated by [CONTACT_259451] (UO). This project is a research and intervention study. We collect information about foster parents and children’s lives. We will use this information to learn more about caregiver stress and child behavior. During this study, the child will complete one pre-test visit and one post-test visits. This project will compare two types of parenting support. What makes this a research study is that we don’t know which is better. By [CONTACT_259452], we hope to know more about the types of support that best help parents. 	
  Every child in the project will be put into one of two groups. Both groups will attend parent meetings for 12 weeks. All families will do the research assessments described below. One group will do the regular KEEP-P curriculum and one group will do a revised version (KEEP-V) that includes a video coaching component.  The family/child will be put in one of these groups randomly, such as by a lottery system. You will not be able to choose the group.  This is part of the research design. 	
  KEEP-P parent groups have two main purposes: (1) to help parents build skills to support their child’s development and (2) to provide parents with support.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_259434], praising good behavior and setting limits.  KEEP-P foster parent groups meet weekly for twelve-weeks. Groups are two hours long. Childcare and food is provided.   KEEP-V includes video coaching. The KEEP-V facilitator will film the caregiver and child together and show the caregiver clips of the things that they are already doing to help the child learn and grow. The filming sessions are quick and easy. Every other week, a facilitator will meet with the caregiver and child at their home or at the group location to film them both together for 10 minutes doing everyday activities like playing or having a snack. The next week at the group meeting the facilitator will show parts of the video in which families are doing things that support

  the child’s development. The coach will encourage caregivers to notice these skills at home in-between sessions. Whether you, or the family and/or child, choose to take part in this research or not, none of the usual services the family or child receive through the child welfare system will be affected.  What will we ask the child to do if she/he joins the project? We will ask the child to do two interviews over the next 18 months.  The details of each visit are listed in the chart below:

  What other types of information will the project collect? This project collects information in different ways. We will ask the child to interact with project staff during game-like activities.  This child will also be asked to interact with his/her caregiver in an activity.  We will also collect information from foster parents from questionnaires. We record activities with video cameras.  We also collect: 
Page 3 of 5 KEEP-P Caseworker Consent IRB: 07/16/2015 	
  
	
  •  information from agencies such as child welfare •  physical information (height, weight, head circumference)  How long is the project? The project is planned to last for five years until June 2018. The child will be asked to be in [ADDRESS_315391] data about the child for 18 months. 	
  Who else will take part? About [ADDRESS_315392] foster children who are ages 2.5 to 6 years old. 	
  	
  Would the UO ever ask this family to stop participating? Yes, sometimes situations change.  For example, this child might return home to his/her biological parents or move to another foster home. If the child leaves his/her current foster placement, the foster family would no longer be able to participate. We will continue to ask for the child’s participation, seeking consent from the child’s current caregiver (foster, biological, adoptive). 	
  	
  What happens if the child needs more or different services/treatment? Sometimes you or project staff might feel that the child needs other help. We can give you or their current caregiver information or contacts for other services. 	
  What are this child’s rights as a participant in this project? This child has certain rights while he/she is in this project. These rights help protect him/her. •  You and this child can decide to be in the project or not. It is voluntary and always your and the child’s choice. •  You or this child can change your mind about being in this project at any time. If this child decides to quit the project, or if you decide that the child should quit the project, there will be no negative results of any kind. •  The child can choose not to participate in any or all of the interview activities. They are important to the project and we would like him/her to answer them completely. But if there are some questions he/she does not want to answer or activities he/she does not want to complete, he/she may skip them and move on to other questions. •  The child also has the right not to do other parts of the project. •  You will get a copy of this Consent Form. •  You and this child are free to ask questions about the project at any time. You may contact [CONTACT_079], Phillip Fisher, PhD at [PHONE_5389] or [EMAIL_4973] or the Program Manager, Kristen Greenley at [PHONE_5390] or [EMAIL_4974]. You can call collect.

   How will this child’s privacy (or confidentiality) be protected? We will do all we can to keep everything about this child completely private. Here are the ways that we protect his/her privacy. •  We use a number instead of his/her name [CONTACT_259459]/her that we study and analyze. •  We store all information in safe, locked areas. •  We study information from everyone in the project as a group, not as individuals. When we share project results, we will not identify any one person. We will not use names or other personal information. •  We train all staff members to protect the child’s privacy. Only a small number of them will see his/her information. In some cases, the agency, the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, that is responsible for and funding this project might see information about him/her as part of their review of our project. They are also required to protect this child’s privacy. •  We will not share this child’s answers with anyone without your permission. We will not share anyone else’s answers with you or this child, including answers from his/her family members/caregivers. Are there times when we will share information about this child? Yes, these are called “exceptions to confidentiality.” Project staff will keep all of this child’s information private, except in the following cases:  •  We might hear or see something that we think is current or past abuse of a child. We might see or hear something that tells us that a child is in danger. Or we might learn that a child has witnessed violence (such as adults fighting in the home). In cases like these, we will take action to protect the child. We will talk to the child’s caregiver and/or the child welfare agency. •  We will also report if we hear that this child plans to hurt themselves or someone else. 	
  What are the possible risks to this child as a participant in the project? As a participant in this project, there are a few risks: •  We collect personal information about this child. There is the chance that someone who should not see his/her information might see it. •  This child might feel uncomfortable with some parts of the project. For example, the game-like activities may be frustrating to some children.  He/she is free to say “no” or stop at any part.

  What are the benefits to this family and child as participants?  Potential benefits for the children include prevention of behavioral and emotional problems and improved adjustment at home, in daycare, preschool and school, and in the community. Benefits to foster, kin, and biological parents may be an increase in their knowledge and ability to work with their child, resulting in greater satisfaction in their role as parents or foster parents. In addition, with increased skills, foster parents may be less likely to request that a foster child be removed because of difficult behaviors. All participants are expected to benefit in that they will derive satisfaction from contributing to the knowledge gained from this research.  	
  What will be done with the information we collect for this project? We will use information from this project for research and education only. We will share the results of the project in papers, books and presentations. We might share results and data with other education or research centers. We will not use names or other personal information when we share project results or data.

The UO Research Compliance Services oversees the review of the research to protect your rights and is not involved with this study. How will your privacy (or confidentiality) be protected? We will do all we can to keep everything about you and your family completely private. Here are the ways that we protect your privacy. 	
  •  We use a number instead of your name [CONTACT_259463]. •  We store all information in safe, locked areas. •  We study information from everyone in the project as a group, not as individuals. When we share project results, we will not identify any one person. We will not use names or other personal information. •  We train all staff members to protect your privacy. Only a small number of them will see your information. In some cases, the agency, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, that is responsible for and funding this project might see information about you as part of their review of our project. They are also required to protect your privacy. •  We will not share your answers with anyone without your permission. We will not share anyone else’s answers with you, including answers from your family members. Are there times when we will share information about you? Yes, these are called “exceptions to confidentiality.” Project staff will keep all of your information private, except in the following cases:   •  We might hear or see something that we think is abuse of a child. We might see or hear something that tells us that a child is in danger. Or we might learn that a child has witnessed violence (such as adults fighting in the home). In cases like these, we will take action to protect the child. We will talk to you and/or the child welfare agency. •  We will also report when we hear that someone plans to hurt themselves or someone else. What are the possible risks to you as a participant in the project? As a participant in this project, there are a few risks to you: •  We collect personal information about you and your child. There is the chance that someone who should not see your information might see it. •  You might feel uncomfortable with some parts of the project. For example, some questions we ask are personal. Or you might feel uncomfortable being videotaped. You are free to say “no” to any part. 	
  	
  What are the benefits to you as a participant? Potential benefits for the children include prevention of behavioral and emotional problems and improved adjustment at home, in daycare, preschool and school, and in the community. Benefits to foster, kin, and biological parents may be an increase in their knowledge and ability to work with their child, resulting in greater satisfaction in their role as parents or foster parents. All participants are expected to benefit in that they will derive satisfaction from contributing to the knowledge gained from this research.

  Statement of Informed Consent: Parent  KEEP-P project 	
  You are invited to be in a continuing research project at the University of Oregon Prevention Science Institute called, Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_259435] – Preschoolers (KEEP-P) with your child. The KEEP-P project’s main goal is to find out what type of services can be helpful for parents, particularly in reducing stress and improving placement stability. This study is being conducted by [CONTACT_259450], PhD from the University of Oregon. [CONTACT_79783] is also affiliated with Oregon Social Learning Center (OSLC) and OSLC Community Programs. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is funding this project (grant #1R01HD0757516-01). 	
  Do you want to participate? It is your decision to be in the project and to give permission for your child to be in the project. Before you decide, you need to know the risks and benefits. You should also know what we will ask you and your child to do. Please take your time to read this form. The form explains the project. A staff member will also explain the project and answer your questions. 	
  If you agree to be in this project you will sign this consent form. When you sign the consent form, you “give consent.” This means that you agree to be in the project. It also means that you understand what we will ask you to do. Please review this consent form carefully. Staff will answer any questions you have before you sign the form. 	
  What is the purpose of the project? KEEP-P is a new program being evaluated by [CONTACT_259451] (UO). This project is a research and intervention study. We will collect information about parents and children’s lives. We will use this information to learn more about caregiver stress, and child behavior. By [CONTACT_259452], we hope to know more about the types of support that best help children.   Every family in the project will be put into one of two groups. Both groups will attend parent meetings for 12 weeks. One group will do the regular KEEP-P curriculum and one group will do a revised version (KEEP-V) that includes a video coaching component. You will be put in one of the groups randomly, such as by a lottery system. You will not be able to choose the group.  This is part of the research design.   KEEP-P parent groups have two main purposes: (1) to help parents build skills to support their child’s development and (2) to provide parents with support.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_259437], praising good behavior and setting limits.  KEEP-P parent groups meet weekly for twelve-weeks. Groups are two hours long. Childcare and food is provided.   KEEP-V includes video coaching. Your KEEP-V facilitator will film you and your child together and show you clips of things that you are already doing that help your child learn and grow. The filming sessions are quick and easy. Every other week, your facilitator will meet with you at home or at the group location to film you and your child together for 10 minutes doing everyday activities like playing or having a snack. The next week at the group meeting your facilitator will show parts of the video in which you are doing things that support your child’s development. Your coach will encourage you to notice these skills at home in-between sessions.  Whether you choose to take part in this research or not, none of the other services your family receives (such as through EC CARES) will be affected. However, because this is a research and intervention study participants who take part in the research will have priority in attending the parent group meetings.

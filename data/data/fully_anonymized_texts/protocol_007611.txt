Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.[ADDRESS_387030] 
affected and account for over 85% of these deaths [1 , 2]. The crude incidence rate of human 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) related cancers is 25.1 cases per 100,000  women in Honduras, with approximately 
991 new cases and 417  deaths reported annually  [3].  
There are two key prevention opportunities for cervical cancer: 1) primary prevention via  HPV  vaccines 
administered before sexual debut; and 2) secondary prevention by [CONTACT_314566] [4,  5]. In developi[INVESTIGATOR_314540] , historically there has been a 
lack of appropriate screening, detection and treatment  methods for precancerous cervical lesions . Efforts 
over the past decade or so  have advanced  screening technologies for low -resource settings so that these 
are more accessible in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696] . In particular, more affordable HPV DNA tests are now 
available for cervical cancer screening. According to a recent review, implement ation of HPV testing in 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_314541], Mexico and Argentina was highly effective, feasible 
and acceptable [6]. As a result, six countries in Latin America (Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Mexico and Nica ragua) have incorporated HPV testing in their national cervical cancer 
screening programs [6].  
However, improvements in treatment technologies,  a key component of an effective screening and 
prevention program , have lagged behind. Treatment options  for dev elopi[INVESTIGATOR_314542] -cost, 
effective, and adaptable for areas with limited resources in terms of infrastructure and health providers.  
For the treatment of precancerous cervical lesions  in low -resource settings, WHO recommend s 
cryotherapy  [7], an ablative procedure  where cervical  intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_314543] (CIN) are destroyed  using  
freezing  employing  compressed refrigerant gas . This method is easy to use,  is acceptable  to women and 
providers , has few side effects (pain, vaginal discharge) , and doe s not have adverse effects on fertility [ 8]. 
However the cost of refrigerant gas and  transport, the unreliable supply and quality of  refrigerant gas in 
low-resource settings , and the large, heavy storage tanks that are difficult to transport  [9, 10] present  
significant  barrier s for utilizing this treatment method [11].  
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.[ADDRESS_387031] being implemented in Honduras including in study areas. When  cryotherapy cannot be performed 
due to non -function al medical equipment or lack of critical supplies such as  the gas, opportunities for 
treatment may be missed. Thus, alternative non -gas treatment technologies such as thermal coagulation 
may offer a more feasible treatment option for  women with  precancerou s lesions  in such settings . 
Use of Thermal Coagulation Therapy for CIN  
Thermal coagulation (also known as ‘cold coagulation’) applies a heat ed probe  (100 -120°C) to the tissue 
to be treated  in order to destroy the abnormal cells . Recently published guidelines from the American  
Society of Clinical Oncology  (ASCO) states that  thermal coagulation is an option for ablative treatment 
[12]. Thermal coagulation has been used in the [LOCATION_008] f or several decades for the treatment of 
precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix, and literature states  that the rates of lesion disappearance 
with thermal coagulation  are as good or better than th ose achieved by [CONTACT_314567]  [13-16]. 
Studies utilizing  thermal coagulation treatment have been limited in other developed and developi[INVESTIGATOR_314544] . A recent meta -analysis found that  cure rates w ere 95% among  CIN2 -3 patients from 13 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_314545] [9 ]. Similar results have been 
documented in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696]: 3 -6 month cure rates in a screen and tre at program in Malawi were 
94% [10 ]; 84% among both HIV-infected and  uninfected women in Nigeria [17]; and more than  80% at 6 
months to 1 year among HIV -infected women  in India [18]. Moreover, this procedure was demonstrated 
to be safe with little or no adverse events , quick, and preserve d fertility  [10].   
Acceptability of thermal coagulation  
Studies on women’s experience of and acceptability of thermal coagulation  indicate the treatment 
method is acceptable and well -tolerated by [CONTACT_31267]. Among 714 CIN2 -3 patients in Scotland randomized 
to treatment with thermal coagulation or CO 2 laser, patients treated with thermal coagulation reported 
lower pain scores and only 8% requested local analgesia during treatment, as compared to 21% in the 
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.0 May 7 , 2019                                          page 9 of 36 laser treatment group [19]. In a double -blind placebo -controlled trial  also conducted in Scotland , 
treatment time was found to be significantly shorter among patients treated with  thermal coagulation 
(median: 3 minutes) as compared to those treated with  CO 2 laser (media n: 12 minutes) [20]. The m ajority 
of the studies in a meta -analysis on the efficacy of  thermal coagu lation reported that local analgesia was 
not needed during treatment  [9], and  in findings from a recent [LOCATION_003] randomized placebo -controlled trial 
without  local anesthetic, 44 .7% of patients who received thermal coagulation treatment reported mild or 
no pai n at the most  [21]. Studies of acceptability in low and middle -income countries are more limited. 
According to providers in Zambia, women undergoing thermal coagulation reporte d almost no pain to the 
providers and, as compared to cryotherapy, providers perceived greater acceptability of thermal 
coagulation therapy among women [10]. In a study among HIV -infected women in India, thermal 
coagulation was well -tolerated without anest hesia and was considered safe to administer in an out -
patient setting [18].  
Hence, m ore studies are needed to evaluate the success  and acceptability of thermal coagulation as an 
option for treating precancerous cervical lesions, especially in low -resource settings where there are 
inherent challenges to provide timely and successful (in terms of lesion disappearance)  treatment to 
wome n with CIN lesions. Such studies, especially in low -resource settings, will be particularly useful to 
inform country decision making with respect to treatment options for women with CIN.  
Devices used in this study  
Liger Thermocoagulator HTU -110 
Thermocoagulator HTU -110TM, manufactured by [CONTACT_314568], LLC, is a battery -powered thermal 
coagulation device designed for low -resource settings given it does not rely on a consistent electrical 
supply, a known continual challenge in such settings. The device is capable of perfor ming approximately 
30 treatment procedures per fully -charged battery. The device requires about one minute per treatment: 
a warm -up time of approximately 10 seconds, and a 40 -second application at 120 ⁰C.  To completely 
charge the battery packs, they are p laced in the A/C charging base for approximately 5 hours. The device 
comes with 2 lithium -ion battery packs and a charging base with A/C adaptor; hence one battery can 
charge while the other is in use.  The device received Class II FDA clearance for market ing in the United 
States in 2016 for ablative treatment, a similar classification as cryotherapy devices. Bench data reports 
submitted by [CONTACT_314568], LLC for this application state that testing demonstrates that the HTU -110 
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.[ADDRESS_387032] the same  clinical results 
[22, 23]. To date the Liger Thermocoagulator has been used in pi[INVESTIGATOR_314546] [ADDRESS_387033] cryotherapy is planned in Zambia for 2017, sponsored by [CONTACT_314569], University of North Carolina and Liger Medical, LLC.  
Pocket Colposcope  
The Pocket Colposcope  is an investigational device developed at Duke University (Durham, North 
Carolina). The device is the shape and size o f a tampon, and is inserted into the vagina through the 
speculum to capture images of the cervix. It does not come into direct contact [CONTACT_314570]. 
The Pocket Colposcope utilizes a LED ring to provide illumination that is comparable to commer cially 
available colposcopes. The device uses less electrical power, is more portable and is projected to be 
available at much lower cost. The device is currently being used in clinical investigations in four 
international study sites: (1) Durham, North Ca rolina [LOCATION_003] (2) Lima, Peru (3) Nairobi, Kenya and (4) Moshi, 
Tanzania.  The device has undergone four generations of development [ 24, 25], which  were tested in the 
aforementioned sites since 2014 with over 450 patients.  The device received Class II FDA clearance for 
marketing in the [LOCATION_002] in 201 8 for gynecological examination , a similar classification as other 
colposcopes . In this study , the Pocket Colposcope an d photos taken with the device will not be used fo r 
clinical care .  
The study will obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory body in Honduras to use these devices in 
the study.  
Rationale for study  
Currently t here are limited available and reliable treatment options in Honduras  and other developi[INVESTIGATOR_314547]. Experience and research with thermal 
coagulation in such settings is also limited. Thermal coagulation offers an a lternative ablative procedure 
to cryotherapy with  comparable cure rates , and devices such as the Thermocoagulato r HTU -110 may 
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.0 May 7 , 2019                                          page 11 of 36 potentially overcome the barriers frequently experienced by [CONTACT_314571] . In this study, we plan 
to use the Thermocoagulator device for the treatment of precancerous  cervical  lesions among women 
aged 30 -49 at four government health facilities  in Honduras , to assess its safety  and acceptability (primary 
objectives) . Since in this study we are not comparing thermal coagulation treatment with another 
treatment such as cryotherapy, w e will not be able to directly measure effectiveness of treatment by  [CONTACT_314572] . However , we will be able to observe  the outcome of lesion disappearance  or 
persistence rates after thermal coagulation  which is an important indicator of treatment success , and to 
explore treatment failure rates due to user error (secondary objectives) .  
Exploration of reasons for treatment failure  
As mentioned above, ablative treatment (cryotherapy and thermal coagulation) for cervical precancer ha s 
been documented to result in lesion disappearance . Treatment failure can posited as  due to 1) 
Characteristic of the lesion – e.g., the precancer does not respond to the treatment  [26], 2) Equipment 
failure – For example, blockage of the gas [27] and 3) User  error  – For example, the provider in correctly 
assign s the patient for ablative tr eatment.  While equipment failure has been studied in some depth [ 28], 
reasons for user error  have not been systematically explored or documented.  
To explore potential re asons for treatment failure in this study, we will use the Pocket Colposcope  to take 
photos of cervices at study enrollment  and at the one -year follow -up visit , and conduct analysis of the 
photos at the end of the study.  
Additionally to above, t he Duke University developers of this device plan  to use de -identified photos and 
corresponding diagnosis information to improve the analytical capability of the device software e.g., and 
ultimately doctor s in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], to identify women for tr eatment.  
2.0 Study objectives

rates of lesion disappearance  or persistence  after thermal coagulation , at four government health 
facilities  in Honduras.  
Primary Objective:  
The primary objectives are : 
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.0 May 7 , 2019                                          page 12 of 36 a. To evaluate the level of pain experienced by [CONTACT_314573].

Secondary Objectives:  
The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:  
a. To determine the 12 -month rates of CIN2 -3 lesion  disappearance as compared with  persistence 
after  thermal coagulation using the Thermocoagulator HTU -110 device.   
b. To explore potential  reasons for treatment failure , and explore options for improving the 
diagnos tic capacity of evaluators in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696].  
c. To improve the analytical capability of the Pocket Colposcope software.  
3.0 Methods  
3.1 Study design  
 
Study Location  
This descriptive  study will be conducted at four  government health facilities  in Honduras . This will include  
urban  and peri -urban  health facilities , located in Región Metropolitana de Tegucigalpa that spans an area 
of 8,619 km2 and has a population of 352,784 women of reproductive age (15 -49 years). This region  is 
part of the government cervical cancer screening program t hat conducts HPV testing, and has trained 
personnel with capability to conduct Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid ( VIA), collect biopsy specimen s, 
and conduct thermal coagulation t reatment as well as cryotherapy . Cryotherapy will be available at each 
study health facility  to women  who decline to participate in the study. We expect the  different locations 
of these health facilities within Tegucigalpa  will capture some of the diversity of the target population  
e.g., in terms of socio -economic  status and culture  in Honduras . 
Sample Size and Methods  
Objective 1 - Based on previous studies, acceptability related to pain and mild bleeding from the thermal 
coagulation procedure and the proportion of minor adverse events (e.g., vaginal discharge longer than 
one week)  are estimated  to be 90% and 25% , respectively. In this study , we are assuming 8 5% 
acceptability and no more than 15% minor adverse events. We calculate  that a sample size of 320 women 
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.0 May 7 , 2019                                          page 13 of 36 who are HPV positive , VIA positive , and eligible for ablative treatment will provide  a 95% confidence 
interval to adequately estimate an acceptability proportion of 85% (CI 95%: 80.6 –88.7) and an adverse 
event proportion of up to 15% (CI: 95%: 11.3–19.4) with  80% and 99% power, respectively,  and an alpha 
of 0.05.  
Objective 2 - Literature suggests a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 12 -month cure  rate for treatment of CIN2 -3 lesions  in HIV -
negative women is 90% using thermal ablation  [29]. With a minimum sample size of  [ADDRESS_387034]  more than 80% power to detect a success rate of 90% or better (CI 95%: 80.0–96.0) for the outcome 
of lesion disappearance after thermal coagulation treatment.  
From the 320 women needed for Objective 1, we estimate that : 1) between  15–20% of women with 
positive HPV and positive VIA are determined to have CIN2 -3 lesions; 2) loss to follow -up may be 10 –15%. 
(While current dropout  rates are approximately 40%, we anticipate a lower loss to follow -up rate due to 
study efforts to follow -up women).  
Thus,  we expect approximately [ADDRESS_387035] 54 women with CIN2 -3 to observe CIN2 -3 lesion disappearance after thermal coagulation 
treatment with a power of > 65%. 
For quality control  (QC)  purposes , the study will also evaluate the 12 -month cure rate among an 
additional 10% sample of women who receive treatment with thermal coagulation who are biopsy -
negative  or with a CIN1 diagnosis . Among the 320 women needed for Objective 1 , we estimate that 80% 
will be biopsy -negative or have CIN1  lesions  or less . Thus, after accounting for 10 –15% loss to follow up, 
we plan to follow up a n additional 60  women at 12 months.     
Statistical Analyses  
Data will be entered into a Microsoft Excel database with built -in validation rules to minimize data entry 
errors. Descriptive statistical analysis, including calculating point estimates, distribution , and frequencies 
of responses, will be used to summarize and characterize the study population. For some secondary 
endpoin ts, Chi -square tests will be employed to make comparisons between groups.  
Women  who complete treatment but not the 1-year follow -up visit will be included in the analysis of pain 
and acceptability, but will be excluded from the analysis of lesion persiste nce or disappearance. The 
sample size takes into account 10 -15%  of women lost to follow -up. The study staff will be responsible for 
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.[ADDRESS_387036] possible level s of pain  using the Wong -
Baker FACES® pain rating scale . Women’s acceptability will also be assessed by [CONTACT_314574] a friend or relative who needed similar 
treatment as well as reasons for her response.   
b. Short -term safety will be calculated as the number  of women with each type of adverse event 
(numerator), divided by [CONTACT_314575] (denominator).  These are adverse events 
that WHO specifies as short -term safety concerns for ablative treatment and include: minor bleeding 
minor bleeding r equiring packing or suturing; major bleeding requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/blood 
transfusion; major infections requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314549]; damage to other organs or 
other surgery required such as injury to bladder or urethra; and major infect ions requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314550].  
Secondary endpoints  
a. To calculate rates  of disappearance of lesions , we will include women with histologically -confirmed 
CIN2 -3 lesions. The 12-month  rate of disappearance of CIN 2 -3 lesions  will be calculated by [CONTACT_314576] 2 -3 at 12 months after undergoing thermal 
coagulation for the treatment of their CIN2 -3 lesions (numerator), divided by [CONTACT_314577] 12 months  (denominator).  Analysis will include considering potential confounding factors such as 
clinic and provider  as well as drop -out rates . Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test will be used to confirm 
whether there are differences in rates by [CONTACT_314578].  Similar analyses will be 
performed for women in the QC group, dividing the number of women  with  no evidence of CIN 2 -3 at 
12 months who were biopsy -negative or CIN1 at baseline (numerator) by [CONTACT_314579] 12 months who were biopsy -negative or CIN1 at baseline (denominator). We will 
compare these results to the lesion disappearance rate in the CIN2 -[ADDRESS_387037] that the 
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.0 May 7 , 2019                                          page 15 of 36 percentage of women with no detectable lesion  in the QC group will be superior or equal to that 
observed among women with CIN2 -3 at baseline.   
b. Analysis of cervical photos will  be a qualitative compar ison of  the characteristics of the uterine cervix 
and the pre -cancerous lesions at Visit 1 ( enrollment ) in women whose treatment resulted in 
disappearance of lesions  and women with persistent pre -cancerous lesions  after 12 months . The 
evaluation will examine what features  or cervical conditions prior to treatment might be related to 
disappearance or persistence of lesions,  such as shape of the cervix, size and location of the lesions, 
etc. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test will be used to confirm whether there are any differences by

Pregnant women will be  excluded from this study.  If a woman becomes pregnant during the study, she 
will be referred to OB/Gynecology for proper follow -up and will exit the study.  Women who are 3 months 
postpartum are eligible  for the study as this is considered a safe interval to begin screening and 
treatment . 
3.3 Study procedures  
Usual care   
Under u sual care for cervical cancer screening in the public system in Honduras  women  undergo HPV 
testing at health facilities offering that cervical cancer screening; test results are usually available within 1 
month.  Per national guidelines:  women with negative HPV test results ar e advised to get rescreened in [ADDRESS_387040] of care  in Honduras for this step . VIA involves examining the cervix for precancerous epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] 
(using a vaginal speculum and a source of light) one minute after application of 5% acetic acid, which 
makes abnormal cells turn white. Results are available immediately and are explained to women. Women 
with abnormal/acetowhite VIA results and whose lesions qualify for ablative treatment as determined by

Day 1 +7 days : Enrollment into study ; Treatment using therm al coagulation  (Length of visit: 1 -2 hours)  
Screening for Eligibility : Women with positive HPV and VIA test results  and who qualif y for ablative 
treatment will be invit ed to participate in the study  during the triage visit described above  by [CONTACT_314586]  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.0 May 7 , 2019                                          page 17 of 36 provider , using the Recruitment Script for Doctor s. If a wom an is interested in learning more about the 
study, a study staff will use the Recruitment Script for Study Staff to tell them more about the stud y.  
Consent : If the woman is interested in joining the study based on interview questions for eligibility, she 
will be taken through the consent process  and women who consent will then be assessed for pregnancy 
using a urine pregnancy test. Women who are p regnant or who choose not to join the study will be 
referred for standard of care based on their pregnancy result and need for CIN treatment.  For w omen 
who remain eligible and have consent ed to participate in the study , the research staff will fill out 
information on the Data Collection Form for the enrollment visit based on the woman’s eligibility and 
screening information.  
Baseline interview/Cervical photographs : After the baseline interview  if women choose , a health provi der 
will take 1 or more  digital p hotos  of the cervix  using the Pocket  Colposcope.  Duke University staff will 
train study staff in the particular usage of this specific device.  The training will emphasize that the doctor 
cannot use the Pocket Colposcope photos to evaluate or treat the woman.  
Biopsies : Then the health provider will  take one or more directed biopsy /ies of any abnormal/acetowhite 
lesions as detected by [CONTACT_314587].  
Therm al coagulation : After this , the health provider  will perform  thermal coagulation treatment on the 
woman. Analgesia (topi[INVESTIGATOR_314552]/AINES) will be available to women during treatment  and 
post -treatment for pain management. These will be  offered to women following  standard of care 
procedures and treatments. The technique for t reatment by [CONTACT_314588] 
(the standard of care treatment) in that a probe -like device is applied to the surface of the cervix to freeze 
(cryotherapy) or heat ( thermal coagulation) the lesion. In addition t he health provider will be trained by 
[CONTACT_314589] [INVESTIGATOR_314553].  
Post -treatment Counseling /Interview ing: The health provider or study staff will give counseling about 
post -treatment care.   
After treatment with thermal coagulation, a study staff will interview each woman about her experience 
with the treatment , including pain (if any) experienced during the procedure. In addition, women will be

better understand acceptability of the treatment  to women .  
Scheduling Follow -up: Study staff will then give w omen an appointment to return in [ADDRESS_387042] . 
Study procedures are shown in Figure 1.  
Study Visit 2

If women do not show up for their follow -up visit, study staff will contact [CONTACT_314590] -up Script.  
Review of Biopsy Results : At the one -month follow -up visit, study staff will meet  and explain to women  
their biopsy results .  
Pelvic  Exam : At this visit a  health provider will also conduct a pelvic  examination for returning women to 
assess short term safety outcomes per WHO guidelines for ablative treatment. This is visualization and 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_314554], uterus and pelvic area to  assess for any complications, infections, etc. that the 
woman experienced after treatment.  If the woman exp erienced any problems from the treatment during 
the time before this visit, the study staff will collect the information from the woman, adverse events 
report or health facilities records as needed and record the  information  to the study data collection fo rm. 
1. A convenience sample of 60 women  with negative or CIN1 diagnoses will be scheduled for a 
follow -up visit 12 months from the date of receipt of treatment  as a quality check to ensure no 
evidence of CIN2 -3 at 12 months . All biopsy negative and CIN1 women will be invited to 
continue  in the study as part of the quality control group until the sample size is reached. 
Women with negative  or CIN1 diagnoses who do not wish to continue the study and w omen 
with negative or CIN1 diag noses who attend Visit 2 after the sample size of 60 is reached will 
exit the study and be advised to be screened again in 1 year per national guidelines.

date of receipt of treatment . 
Study Visit 3  
Day 3 58 +/- 7 days: HPV sample collection visit (Length: 30 minutes ) 
The goal of the HPV  sample collection visit is to collect  a specimen  to be tested for the presence of HPV 
infection  prior to the 12-month follow -up visit . Prior to specimen collection, the woman will be taken 
through an addendum consent process, where she will go through the updated study procedures with the 
study nurse an d provide informed consent . This visit may take place in a woman’s home, where she will 
self-collect a vaginal specimen with a collection kit provided by [CONTACT_314592], or in a clinic.  
If a woman refuses to self -collect a sample, a provider w ill collect a sample for the HPV test.   
 
Study Visit 4  
Day 365 +/ -14 days : 12-month follow -up visit  (Length: 1 hour)  
The goal of the follow -up visit is to provide a rigorous check  for persistent CIN2 -[ADDRESS_387043] for biopsy in the [LOCATION_002] do not recommend nontargeted biopsies, or 
biopsies on women with “a completely normal colposcopic impression (i.e., no acetowhitening, 
metaplasia, or other visible abnormality ).” [31] At this visit, biopsies will be taken only from women with  a 
positive visual evaluation.   
Prior to initiating clinical procedures at Visit 4, women will be asked questions regarding possible 
pregnancy  per standard practice , including the date of her last menses. If pregnancy is suspected, a 
pregnancy test will be  done. In the event of a pregnancy, the woman will receive care for her pregnancy 
per standard practice  and undergo procedures 1 –[ADDRESS_387044] cases, treatment can safely wait until after the birth of the baby.  
Procedures for Visit 4 are as follows :

2. The study doctor  will take 1 or more digital photos of the cervix using the Pocket Colposcope , as done 
in Visit 1. The doctor will not use the Pocket Colposcope photos to evaluate or treat the woman.  
3. The study doctor will perform a visual inspection with acetic acid  (VIA). Women with a positive visual 
evaluation  will have directed biopsies  from any visible lesion.  
4. Women who are HPV -positive and visual evaluation –negative will receive a standard Pap test.  
5. Women who are HPV -negative and visual evaluation –negative will exit the study.  Follow -up will be 
recommended according to standard  of care instructions.

woman ar e included into women’s medical records when the participants complete the study to enable 
continuity of care.  
Specimen handling  
Biopsy specimens will be collected and stored per standard practice (formalin at room temperature). All 
collected biopsy specimens will be labeled and identified by a unique study identification number and will 
be accessible only to study staff. All collec ted biopsy specimens will be handled and stored securely at all 
four health facilities  in Honduras  or the ASHONPLAFA office  and transferred  once a week to an 
internationally validated pathologist in Tegucigalpa, where they will be evaluated. In accordance with 
local clinical practices , biopsy specimens collected through this study will be retained in a secure location

Device training will include the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]:  
• Checking device before use and activating  
• Thermal coagulator – how to identify cervical tissue that has been correctly ablated/treated  
• Pocket Colposcope – how to make sure photos have  been taken, label led and save d correctly  
• Battery charging  
• Cleaning and disinfection  
• Regular maintenance and inspection  
• Potential complications, trouble -shooting  
4.0 Ethical aspects and consent process  
The study team will obtain approval from appropriate regulatory bodies in Honduras prior to beginning 
the study.  
4.1 Recruitment  
The health provider conducting the VIA screening of HPV+ women will identify women who are qualified 
for ablative treatment . The provider will ask if the woman is interested to learn more about the study 
(Appendix B). If interested , a study staff member  will provide  more information about the study and 
invite them to participate in the study via  a Recruitment Script  for Research Study Staff . The Recruitment 
Script will include asking study -eligible wom en about their menstrual history and  whether  or not  they are 
or may be pregnant.  
4.2 Consent process  
Study staff will obtain written informed consent from w omen who are eligible for the study.  
 
Only women who voluntarily give written informed consent (Ap pendix D) will be enrolled into the study  in 
a private setting . A study staff member  will explain all aspects of the study to the potential participants, 
emphasize  that participation in this study is voluntary, and that a participant ’s care will not  be affected by 
[CONTACT_314594]. Women will be asked  to read the consent themselves and 
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.0 May 7 , 2019                                          page 24 of 36 be encouraged to ask questions of the study nurse. If a woman is unable to read the consent and requires 
it to be read to her, a literate, impartial witness will serve as  a consent witness to ensure that the 
participant understands t he study information, including risks and benefits . Once all the woman’s 
questions have been answered satisfactorily, women will be given the opportunity to choose to 
participate. The study staff will ask several q uestions to confirm the woman’s understanding of the 
purpose of study and key information about the study . If the w oman demonstrates her understanding of 
the study  and agrees  to participate , she will be asked to sign, or give her thumbprint if she is unable to 
sign. Women will sign two identical consents and will be given a copy of one of the consent s to take 
home. It will be emphasized that women who decide not to participate in the study will receive their 
treatment according to the standard of care protocol established by [CONTACT_314595].  
 
At Visit 3, a  study staff member will explain all  updated  aspects of the study to the participants  during an 
additional consent process and ask the woman to sign or thumbprint (if unable to sign) the addendum 
consent form  (Appendix G) . If a woman is unable to read the consent and requires it to be read to her, a  
literate, impartial witness will serve as a consent witness to ensure that the participant understands the 
study information, including risks and benefits.  If it is not  possible  to ensure the presence of an impartial 
witness to serve  as a consent witness in a woman’s home if she is unable to read the addendum consent 
form, the woman will be scheduled to come in to the clinic for Visit 3 where an impartial witness will be 
available.   
4.3 Risks  
Thermal coagulation has been shown to be safe in several studies with low potential for serious adverse 
event s. In a 2014 meta -analysis by [CONTACT_314596] [9], the authors state that this method “constitutes a safe 
and acceptable procedure, as side -effects among analyzed  studies were infreque nt and of low or 
moderate severity”. The side effects of thermal coagulation a re similar to that of cryotherapy. Bench data 
[Liger Clinical Report] demonstrate that the expected risks using the Liger Thermocoagulator are no more 
than other ablative treatment methods and instruments. Hence,  we do not anticipate greater risks for 
wome n receiving treatment via the Liger Thermocoagulator aside from the expected risks from thermal 
coagulation treatment.  
Anticipated risks  during thermal coagulation treatment  include the following:  
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.0 May 7 , 2019                                          page 25 of 36 • Women may feel mild pain or discomfort during the pr ocedur e.  
• Women may experience vaginal discharge or bleeding after tre atment with thermal coagulation.   
      Rarer but more serious risks of thermal coagulation treatment include:  
• Heavy bleeding  
• Infection  
• Injury to bladder or urethra  
• Accidental burns to vagin a 
Currently photos of the cervix are used during colposcopy evaluation in some private practice settings, 
but not utilized in the public system in Honduras for diagnosis or treatment. Photos are not used in the 
[LOCATION_003] for diagnosis or treatment for cervical can cer. The Pocket Colposcope is anticipated to add no or 
minimal risks to women as it is minimally invasive and use of this device does not involve direct physical 
contact [CONTACT_314597], cervix, or external genitalia. Handling of the Pocket Colposcope will follow the 
standard of care protocol for reusable medical devices.  
Anticipated risks of the cervix photo include the following:  
• Women may feel uncomfortable having photos of their cervices taken.  
4.4 Mitigation of Risks  
The following step s will be taken to minimize potential risks:  
• Highly skilled and trained gynecologists  will perform thermal coagulation t reatment , take photos 
with the Pocket Colposcope , and conduct the gynecological procedures in the study . They  will 
have experience condu cting other ablative treatment e.g., cryotherapy.  As mentioned,  
cryotherapy is currently the standard of care treatment and thermal coagulation mainly differs 
from cryotherapy by [CONTACT_314598].  
• Prior to study start, each thermal coagulation device will be tested e.g., on chicken breasts , to 
ensure each device is fully functional .  
• Study doctors will be trained to be able to identify what correctly conducted  ablation looks like on 
a treated cervix as well as wha t it looks like when not correctly done. They will also be trained  to 
report problems with conducting the treatment in the interest of correctly understanding or 
improving the treatment.  
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.0 May 7 , 2019                                          page 26 of 36 • Local and Seattle PIs as well as Duke University staff will attend  the study training and initial 
participant enrollment to monitor early use of d evice s and conduct of treatment by [CONTACT_219122] . 
Study doctors  will be observed and re -trained as needed during  the initial training period. If a 
study doctor  demonstrates repea ted problems in administering thermal coagulation or use of the 
Pocket Colposcope, they will be replaced.  
• The study will have a back -up unit available in the case of malfunction or failure of a device. 
Malfunction or failure will be reported to local and Seattle PIs so trouble -shooting and/or device 
replacement can be done. Duke University will be contact[CONTACT_314599]. Device malfunction will be recorded in the data collection form.  
• Study staff will advise w omen on  potential complications and  what to do if they experience these  
after treatment , including the importance of contact[CONTACT_314600].  
• Women wil l be given the option  to participate in the study but not have photos of their cervix 
taken.  
• Study doctors  will be trained not to use the Pocket  Colposcope for treat ment  decisions .  
• The [ADDRESS_387050] of care (cryotherapy) for their visible  
acetowhite lesions. Previous studies have shown less pain and discomfort with thermal coagulation . 
However, at this early stage with thermal coagulation in Honduras, this cannot be known.  Because 
biopsies are not normally part of the standard of care for cervical lesions, women participating in the 
study may benefit from more s pecific diagnosis based on biopsy results, while also being subjected to the 
increased, although minimal, risks of biopsies.  
Not specific to study participants, the  evidence about the feasibility  and acceptability  of thermal 
coagulation  therapy in Honduras  may  contribute to knowledge and decision -making regarding use of 
therm al coagulation therapy in Honduras  more broadly .  
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.[ADDRESS_387051] regular 
telecommunication and/or email communication with the Honduras  study team at least every two weeks  
during enrollment and follow -up. In addition, PATH staff will visit the study sites  at the start and during 
the study as necessary  to:  
• Verify compliance with human subjects and other research regulations and guidelines, including 
adhering to confidentiality guidelines during all study related procedures.  
• Observe trained study staff  to ensure that informed consent is obtained and documented in 
compliance with the study protocol.  
• Assess adherence to the study protocol and study -specific procedures.  
• Confirm the quality and accuracy of data collected at the study sites, and data entered i nto the 
study database, including the validation of data reported on data collection forms.   
 
At any time during the study if any of the following events occur, the study will be paused to 
investigate these events thoroughly:  
o Excessive bleeding (more sign ificant than a menstrual period for more than 2 days) 
occurring in 2 or more participants.  
o Infection or burns (requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314556]) occurring in 2 or more 
participants.  
o Pain at level 5 or more reported by [CONTACT_314601] (10%) of participants.  
o Note: Excessive discharge is difficult to define and distinguish from the discharge that is 
routinely expected; it would not be considered a health threat so will not  require a pause 
in the study.   
These numbers are based on the limited reports of such events in published literature [9, 10].  
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.0 May 7 , 2019                                          page 28 of 36 If the study is paused due to any events above, the next steps would be to review the collected 
data  and adverse events reports, and evaluate the cause of the adverse events (listed above ). If 
the adverse events are determined to be due to provider error , re-training wou ld be done,  and the 
provider carefully observed as they conduct treatment after re -training. If the adverse events are 
due to problems with one specific study thermal coagulation device, treatment with the device in 
question would be halted , and monitor al l future participants for similar issues .  
5.1 Managing and reporting adverse events  
In this study, an adverse event (AE) is any untoward or undesirable event experienced by a participant 
regardless of whether the event is expected or related to the parti cipant’s involvement in the research.  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that involves:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening condition (participant at immediate risk of death)  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• An important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes lis ted above.  
Staff finding out about any SAE must report the event to the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_314557] [ADDRESS_387052] Operating Procedures (to be 
developed by [CONTACT_15328]) . An initial notification can be made followed by a completed report form as 
soon as possible, but at latest within three calendar days of the initial notification. The completed form 
will detail relevant aspects of the adverse event/s, relationship to the st udy (related/ unrelated), action/s 
taken and event outcomes. If applicable, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117984].  
Any relevant information that becomes available after the SAE report form has been sent (outcome, 
precise description  of medical history, results of the investigation, copy of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109340]) 
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.0 May 7 , 2019                                          page 29 of 36 should be forwarded as soon as possible to the Study PI. Confidentiality guidelines should be adhered to 
when forwarding this information . 
5.2 Managing and reporting una nticipated problems or protocol deviations  
In this study, an unanticipated problem is any incident, experience or outcome (physical, psychological, 
economic , or social) that potentially places the participants or others at greater risk for harm.  
A deviati on from protocol is any change in the study procedures that does not follow the approved 
written study protocol.  
Staff are required to report any unanticipated problems or deviations to protocol that occur during the 
study to the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_387053] to 
participate in the study beyond what they would normally incur when they go for screening and 
treatment for lesions. The study will provide a nominal a mount ($5 USD or 100 HNL)  for participant  
transportation for Visits 2, 3, 4, and [ADDRESS_387054] of care per Honduras guidelines, which will be paid for by [CONTACT_1758]. The study will 
not be responsible for any non -research related injuries or any health care servic es sought or received in 
private clinics.  Study doctors together with the local PI [INVESTIGATOR_314558] -investigator (both OB -
GYNs) will determine if the problem is study -related. The Seattle PI [INVESTIGATOR_314559].

6.0 Confidentiality and data management  
Confidentiality  
All study staff will take training for study confidentiality as follows: Study staff will maintain a ll 
information collected by [CONTACT_314602]. Only study staff will have access to d ata and pers onal 
Liger Medical Thermocoagulator  (Honduras) Study           Version 10.0 May 7 , 2019                                          page 30 of 36 identifying information  that identifies study participants , and  access to the secure rooms, computers, 
and/or files where these are stored .  Only s tudy identification numbers will be used to label study 
records , photos,  and specimens. These measures will help ensure protection of confidentiality while 
permitting clinical management.  
Linking documents connecting the participant’s name [CONTACT_314605] g information to the study 
identification number will be maintained for quality control and follow -up purposes. Linking documents 
and other personal information will be destroyed as soon as possible within three years after study 
activities have been compl eted e.g., after all study data has been verified and cleaned and/or necessary 
follow -up has been conducted.  
Study reports and presentations will not contain any personal identifying information of any study 
participant.  
Data Collection, Management and St orage  
Trained study staff will collect data from  study participants  into paper Study Case Report Forms (CRFs) . 
Data collected will include women’s  socio -demographic information,  VIA and biopsy procedures , results,  
short term safety findings (1 month after treatment) , follow -up information , and post -treatment 
question s to assess the level of the pain experienced during the procedure, and any other comments 
and/or concerns experienced (Append ix E). The CRFs and digital cervical p hoto s will not contain t he 
participants’ names or any other identifying information but  will be labeled with the study  identification 
number. The se documents will be filed as part of the study records.  
Data from the CRF and monitoring visits will be entered into the study database by [CONTACT_314603] a secure, password protected online electronic data management system, and the study 
coordinator will oversee data collection and stora ge including the completion of data forms, data entry 
and confidentiality of study data on a regular basis.    
Clinical Information from the study that is relevant to women’s continuity of care will be entered into 
each women’s health facility records when  women exit the study.  The study coordinator will ensure that 
study records are maintained and stored securely throughout the study.  In accordance with funder’s 
requirements, d e-identified data will be made available in a data repository. De-identified di gital photos 
and corresponding diagnoses information will be shared with Duke University for improvement of the

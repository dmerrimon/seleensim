[ADDRESS_664162] a role in the reduction of ischemic recurrences in patients with atherosclerotic disea se 
manifestations [1,2]. These observations indeed challenge a dogma in cardiovascular medicine 
which for decades has emphasized that atherothrombotic complications are primarily platelet 
mediated and accordingly should be treated with platelet inhibiting therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In particular, a 
single antiplatelet agent, most commonly aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], is the standard of care in stable settings, while 
the combination of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_512996] a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor, also known as dual antiplatelet 
therapy (DAPT), has been the corners tone of treatment following an acute coronary syndrome or 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation [3,4]. However, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_512997], as well as on inflammatory reactions, has also raised 
interest on strategies targeting thrombin -mediated effects. Recently, the results of the COMPASS 
(Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) trial have been reported 
[5]. In this trial, patients with stable coronary or peripheral artery disease and no indication for 
oral anticoagulation or DAPT were randomized to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid in combination with 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] , rivaroxaban 5 mg bid monotherapy  or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_512998]. T he study was stopped early 
after a mean follow -up of 23 months due to evidence of a significant 24% relative reduction in 
ischemic outcomes (including a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality) with 
rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_512999] (4.1% versus 5.4%; P<0.001), at the 
price of a 70% increase in major bleeding compared with placebo (but no significant increase in 
fatal and intracranial bleeding) (3.1% versus 1.9%; P<0.001)  [5]. 
The results of the COMPASS trial have questioned how to implement the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_513000], also known as dual pathway inhibition (DPI), in clinical practice , 
Confidential  
February 8, [ADDRESS_664163] been on guideline recommended treatment with DAPT after 
undergoing elective PCI or having exp erienced an ACS. In patients undergoing elective PCI, 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_513001] P2Y 12 inhibitor of choice, while after an ACS, prasugrel and ticagrelor are 
preferred over clopi[INVESTIGATOR_513002]  [6,7]. Standard of care DAPT 
duration is 6 m onths in patients undergoing elective PCI and receiving drug eluting stent and 12 
months after an ACS  [6,7]. In patients who are not at high ischemic risk, P2Y [ADDRESS_664164] tolerated DAPT and are not at high 
bleeding risk  [6,7]. Nevertheless, these patients may also  be candidates for DPI [INVESTIGATOR_513003]-dose rivaroxaban. However, in the COMPASS trial patient s were mostly on 
single antiplatelet therapy with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_513004] (e.g., mean 7 years  from MI)  [5].  
These observations have raised practical considerations on how to implement the results 
of the COMPASS trial in clinical practice particularly for patients who are completing their 
minimum duration of DAPT and contemplating between continui ng with a DAPT regimen 
versus switching to a DPI [INVESTIGATOR_513005]. Therefore, the objectives of this 
investigation are to assess the feasibility of switching from a DAPT to DPI [INVESTIGATOR_513006].

ticagrelor (90mg/bid), or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81mg/qd) plus prasugrel (10mg/bid) will be identified. The 
study will be performed at the Division of Cardiology of University of [LOCATION_012] Heal th,

Description of laboratory assays  
1) VerifyNow (VN) PRU : The VN System is a turbidimetric based optical detection system 
which measures platelet induced aggregation as an increase in light transmittance (Accumetrics, 
San Diego, CA) and will be utilized according to manufacturer’s instructions, as previously 
described [8]. The assay is based on microbead agglutination and uses specific reagents for the 
pathways of interest. The VN -PRU assay, by [CONTACT_8293]+PGE1, measures changes in 
platelet function specific to P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors. The assay is based upon the ability of 
activated platelets to bind fibrinogen. Fibrinogen -coated microparticles aggregate in proportion 
to the number of GP IIb/IIIa receptors expressed. Light transmittance increases as activated 
Confidential  
February 8, 2019  Protocol version 2 
 
9 
 platelets bind and aggregate fibrinogen -coated beads. The instrument measures this change in 
optical signal and reports results in P2Y 12 Reaction Units (PRU).  
2) Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA):  Platelet aggregation will be performed using LTA 
according to standard protocols. Blood will be collected in citrated (3.2%) tubes. LTA will be 
assessed using platelet -rich plasma (PRP) by [CONTACT_8294] a 2 -channel 
aggrego meter (Chrono -Log 490 Model, Chrono -Log Corp., Havertown) as previously described 
[8]. Platelet agonists will include arachidonic acid (AA; 1 mM), collagen ( 3µg/ml) , thrombin 
receptor activating peptide ( TRAP ;15 μM)  and ADP (5 and 20 µM). TF -CaCl 2 [17] rec onstituted 
at a 2x concentration (Neoplastine Cl Plus, Diagnostica Stago reconstituted in 32.5 mM CaCl 2) 
and a combination of 2 µg/ml collagen -related peptide + 5 µM ADP + TF -CaCl 2 (CATF) will 
also be used as agonists. The reagent cocktail CATF will allow to assess the overall platelet 
response to a combination of agonists that leads to activation of multiple platelet pathways, 
including thrombin generation. PRP will be obtained as a supernatant after centrifugation of 
citrated blood at 1000 rpm for 10 minu tes. The isolated PRP will be kept at 37° C before use. 
Platelet -poor plasma (PPP) will be obtained by a second centrifugation of the blood fraction at 
2800 rpm for 10 minutes. Light transmission will be adjusted to 0% with the PRP and to 100% 
for the PPP for each measurement. Curves will be recorded for 6 minutes and platelet 
aggregation will be determined as the maximal percent change (MPA) in light transmittance 
from baseline using PPP as a reference.  
3) TEG 6s Series system:  the TEG 6s system (Haemonet ics Corporation, Braintree, MA, [LOCATION_003]) 
will be used according to manufacture instructions [9]. In brief, the CORA® system is a new 
generation portable thrombelastography technology able to evaluate all phases of hemostasis, 
including time to clot formation, rate of clot formation, strength of clot and residual clot strength

platelet inhibiting drugs. The PlateletMappi[INVESTIGATOR_513010] a set of agonists, ADP and AA 
together with ActivatorF, which can measure the inhibition of platelet function. This assay 
specifically determines the MA (Maximum Amplitude, a measure of clot strength) and the 
reduction in MA due to antiplatele t therapy and reports it as a percentage of reduction in clot 
strength. The HKH reagent , a combination of kaolin and heparinase, generates test data for the 
uninhibited MA resulting from thrombin activation of the blood sample, while the heparinase 
neutral izes the effects of heparin. The HKH test provides measures of R (Reaction time; the 
amount of time between the start of the test and the beginning of coagulation), K (the speed of 
formation of the clot from R time to a specific clot strength), Angle (the speed of clot 
strengthening), LY30 (Percent lysis 30 minutes after MA is finalized) and MA parameters. T he 
AA and ADP test provide measures of MA, percent inhibition and percent aggregation.

 4) Thrombin Generation Assay : TGA assays will be performed using PPP samples prepared 
from the various treatment groups [10]. The TGA assay will be carried out using 
Technothrombin® fluorogenic assay kit (Diapharma) following manufacturer’s recommended 
guidelines. Briefly, a reaction  mix is prepared containing low or high amounts of TF and 
phospholipid micelles, plus the fluorogenic thrombin substrate (1 mM Z -G-G-R-AMC, 15 mM 
CaCl 2). Test samples will be analyzed in duplicate by [CONTACT_513018] a t a 3:2 ratio in a 96 -well plate. After addition of samples, plates will be incubated at 
37oC in a water bath, and kinetics of thrombin generation will be recorded for 60 min at 1 min 
intervals using Synergy -2 fluorescence plate reader set at ~360 nm/~460 nm excitation/emission. 
Data will be recorded in BioTek’s Gen 5 software and analyzed using BioTek FLx800 Gen 
5_TGA Evaluation Software. Final results will be exported into Microsoft excel for data 
analysis.  
 
Study endpoints and statistical analysis  
The pr imary end point of our study will be the comparison of markers of platelet 
aggregation, thrombin generation, and thrombus formation between DAPT and low -dose 
rivaroxaban plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_513011] 30 days. Exploratory end points will include  
the intragroup comparison between aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259940] 90 mg bid and low -dose rivaroxaban 
plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] . Since there are no preliminary data exploring the PD effects of low -dose 
rivaroxaban in addition to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_513012] , we arbit rarily chose a 
sample size of 90 patients ( 30 patients per cohort ). This approach is in line with guidelines for 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_8265] [ 11].

 For baseline characteristics, categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and 
percentages; continuous var iables will be presented as mean ± SD  or median [IQR] . Continuous 
variables will be analyzed for normal distribution with the Kolmogorov -Smirnov test. 
Comparisons for the primary end point as well as for other intergroup  comparisons of continuous 
variables  will be performed with a n analysis of covariance with a general linear model  with 
baseline value of the corresponding platelet function test as a covariate. Intragroup comparisons 
will be performed with paired sample t -test or Wilcoxon test A p-value < 0. 05 will be considered 
statistically significant. Statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS version 24 software 
(SPSS Inc.).

there is limited experience with the effects of low -dose rivaroxaban on platelet function, 
variability may be higher than expected and we cannot currently perform a detailed sample size 
calculation. We anticipate adding this to the protocol after inclusion of the study population has 
been completed. If the samp le size after one year is estimated to be too small, additional patients 
will be included. This approach is in agreement with recommendations for pi[INVESTIGATOR_8265]

February 8, [ADDRESS_664170] associated with the use of low -dose 
rivaroxaban was bleeding. The risk of major bleeding with rivaroxaban was 1 -1.8%; the risk of 
intracranial hemorrhage was 0.4% at 2 years [1,2]. However, such bleedin g prevalence occurred 
in the setting of long -term trial, while our study is limited to only [ADDRESS_664171] 
also excluded from the study patients at increased risk of bleeding complications. Other 
rivaroxaban reported side effects include abnor mal liver function tests (0.2%) [1].  
All adverse events described above, if they were to occur, as well as death, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, procedures of urgent revascularization with PCI or coronary artery by[CONTACT_87258]. Serious a dverse  events will be evaluated by a local data safety 
monitoring board (DSMB) committee, comprised of 2 faculty members (2 cardiologists), not 
directly involved in the research. In the event of a report of a serious adverse event (as defined 
below) the DSMB will meet and antiplatelet treatment management will be managed, including 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_513013], according to physician recommendation.  
 
I. Management of Safety Data  
This Study has been designated as an interventional study.  Janssen requireme nts for IIS 
interventional studies are all adverse events regardless of causality and special situations 
excluding those from subjects not exposed to a Janssen Medicinal Product  and product 
quality complaints with or without an adverse event will be report ed, once the subject has 
signed and dated an Informed Consent Form is obtained until the subject has completed 
participation in the study and for [ADDRESS_664172] dose of study drug.  
 
II. Definitions  
a. Adverse Event (AE)  
Confidential  
February 8, [ADDRESS_664173] administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non - investigational) product, whether or not related 
to that medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) p roduct. (Definition per International 
Conference on Harmonisation [ICH]).  
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laborato ry test 
abnormalities.  
 
b. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Events that Janssen Scientific Affairs is actively monitoring as a result of a previously identified 
signal (even if non -serious).  These adverse events are:  
 
• Suspected severe toxic effect on the bone marrow, such as severe thrombocytopenia 
(platelet count less than 50,000/μL), severe neutropenia (white blood cell count less than 
500/μL), pancytopenia, aplastic anemia  
• Suspected severe hypersensitivity reaction (eg, anaphylaxis, angioedema, severe 
urticaria, bronchospasm, etc.)  
• Severe skin reactions such as Stevens -Johnson Syndrome  
• Suspected severe liver injury  
 
c. Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR)  
A valid ICSR must contain the four minimum criteria required t o meet regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
• an identifiable subject (not disclosing the subject’s name [CONTACT_3816])  
• an identifiable reporter (investigational site)  
• a Janssen medicinal product  
• an adverse event, outcome, or certain special situation  
 
Confidential  
February 8, 2019  Protocol version 2 
 
15 
 The minim um information required is:  
• suspected Janssen product (doses, indication)  
• date of therapy (start and end date, if available)  
• batch or lot number, if available  
• subject details (subject ID and country)  
• gender  
• age at AE onset  
• reporter ID  
• adverse event detail (AE verbatim in English), onset date, relatedness, causality, action 
taken, outcome, (if available)  
• Janssen protocol ID  
 
d. Product Quality Complaint (PQC)  
A product quality compliant is related to a potential quality issue during manufacturing, 
packaging, re lease testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage or distribution of the 
product, or delivery system.  Not all PQCs involve a subject.  Lot and batch numbers are of high 
significance and need to be collected whenever available.  
 
Examples of PQ C include but not limited to:  
• Functional Problem: e.g., altered delivery rate in a controlled release product  
• Physical Defect:  e.g. abnormal odor, broken or crushed tablets/capsules  
• Potential Dosing Device Malfunction: e.g.,  autoinjector button not worki ng, needle 
detaching from syringe  
• Suspected Contamination  
• Suspected Counterfeit.  
 
e. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrenc e that at any dose:  
 
Confidential  
February 8, 2019  Protocol version 2 
 
16 
 • Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
• Is medically important*  
 
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56795] y jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. These should usually be considered serious.  
 
NOTE: DEATH FOR ANY REASON SHOULD BE REPORTED AS A SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENT.  
 
For reports of  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is the sign, symptom or diagnosis which led to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_469949].  
 
Any event requiring in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (or the prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) must be 
report ed as an SAE. Events that do not meet the criteria for SAE reporting are:  
• Reasons described in the Protocol, e.g. drug administration, Protocol -required testing  
• Social reasons, e.g. overnight stay because of distance between home and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
• Surgery or procedure planned and documented prior to entry into the Study.  
 
Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462861] a serious adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:  
Confidential  
February 8, 2019  Protocol version 2 
 
17 
 • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23742] (e.g., social 
reasons such as pending placement in long -term care facility)  
• Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study. [Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_513014]. Any adverse event that results in a 
prolongation of the originally planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n is to be reported as a new 
serious adverse event.]  
 
The cause of death of a subject in a study within [ADDRESS_664174] dose of study drug, 
whether or not the event is expected or associated with the study drug, is considered a 
serious adverse event.  
 
f. Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information  
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safety information. For a medicinal product(s) with a 
marketing autho rization, the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by 
[CONTACT_83407].  
 
III. Special Situations   
Safety events of interest for a Janssen medicinal product that require expediting reporting 
and/or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to:  
• Drug exposure during pregnancy (maternal and paternal)  
• Overdose of a Janssen medicinal product  
• Exposure to a Janssen medicinal product from breastfeeding  
• Suspected abuse/misuse of a Janssen medicinal pro duct 
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a Janssen medicinal product  
• Any failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect) of a Janssen 
medicinal product  
• Medication error involving a Janssen medicinal product (with or without patient 
exposure to the Janssen medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])  
Confidential  
February 8, 2019  Protocol version 2 
 
18 
 • Suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal  
• Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a Janssen medicinal product  
 
These safety events may not meet the definition of an adverse event; however, they are treated 
in the same manner as adverse events. Special situations should be recorded on the Adverse 
Event page of the CRF.  
 
Any special situation that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on a 
Serious Adverse Event Report Form and be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs within [ADDRESS_664175] be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs by [CONTACT_513019] 24 hours of their awareness of the event  using the Serious Adverse 
Event Form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, stillb irth, and 
congenital anomaly) are considered serious adverse events and must be reported using the 
Serious Adverse Event Form.  
 
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be promptly withdrawn from the 
study and discontinue further study treat ment.  
 
Because the effect of the Janssen medicinal product on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in 
partners of male subjects exposed to a Janssen medicinal product will be reported by [CONTACT_513020] 24 hours of their awareness of the event  using the Serious 
Adverse Event Form.  Depending on local legislation this may require prior consent of the 
partner.  
 
Follow -up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae 
in the infant will be required.

 V. Reporting Procedure s for Adverse Events and Pregnancies [and/or Pregnancies in Partners]  
All adverse events, whether serious or non -serious, related or not related, special situations, 
pregnancy exposures and/or pregnancies in partners following exposure to a Janssen medicinal 
product are to be documented by [CONTACT_513021] e CRF and in the subject’s 
source records. Investigators must record in the CRF their opi[INVESTIGATOR_513015] a Janssen medicinal product.  
All (serious and non -serious) adverse events reported for a Janssen medicinal pr oduct should 
be followed -up in accordance with clinical practice.  
 
All serious adverse events that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054], or that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study, must be followed until  
any of the following occurs:  
• The event resolves  
• The event stabilizes  
• The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available  
• The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to 
study conduct  
• It becomes  unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health care 
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after demonstration 
of due diligence with follow -up efforts)

Possible benefits  
The present investigation is aimed to evaluate the PD effects of low -dose rivaroxaban as 
an add -on therapy to standard antiplatelet treatment in patients with CAD. This study is not 
designed to evaluate diffe rences in clinical benefit. However, differences in antiplatelet profiles 
may potentially prompt further investigations of the clinical implication of this difference by 
[CONTACT_3553] a larger scale clinical study.

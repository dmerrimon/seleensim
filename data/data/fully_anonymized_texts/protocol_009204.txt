1. Abstract  
The [LOCATION_002] is experiencing an epi[INVESTIGATOR_297767] -related overdose deaths. Office- based 
buprenorphine treatment could expand access to treatment to the many opi[INVESTIGATOR_297768]. However, office -based buprenorphine has two 
limitations that we will address in this applicatio n: 1) Patients prescribed buprenorphine by [INVESTIGATOR_44203] -based 
providers can divert the buprenorphine for illicit use. 2) Many people in need of buprenorphine treatment 
do not initiate and remain in office -based buprenorphine treatment. We will use Video DOT and 
incentives to enhance office- based buprenorphine treatment.  Video DOT is an innovative, mobile health 
platform that patients can use to record and submit videos of themselves taking medication that are then 
viewable on a secure, web portal for providers to confirm medication adherence. Video DOT could 
facilitate adherence to buprenorphine treatment and safeguard against diversion. The addition of incentives 
could engage out -of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_297769]. Incentive  
interventions, which provide incentives to patients when they meet therapeutic goals, have been highly 
effective in promoting a wide range of health behaviors and have firm theoretical and empi[INVESTIGATOR_297770]. Incentive interventions can promote treatme nt engagement in individuals with substance use 
disorders, including out -of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155]. We propose to develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a novel 
combination of Video DOT and incentives to promote buprenorphine treatment engagement and 
adherence in out -of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155].  The Video DOT+ intervention will provide an incentive for 
linking to buprenorphine treatment and facilitate retention in treatment by [CONTACT_297825]. T he incentives will be 
integrated into the Video DOT platform and delivered remotely to reloadable credit cards to allow for the 
entire intervention to be delivered via mobile technology and to facilitate easy dissemination of the Video 
DOT+ system. Two  randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_297771] 3 years. In both studies, out -of-treatment 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155] (N= 105) will be referred to buprenorphine treatment and randomly assigned to a Usual Care 
(Control) group or Video DOT+ group. Video DOT+ participants will receive the Video DOT+ 
intervention being developed and evaluated in this project. We will assess participants every 4 weeks 
throughout a 24- week intervention period and at 12 weeks after the intervention ends. The primary 
outcome measure will be buprenorphine treatment adherence during the 24 -week intervention. Secondary 
measures will include buprenorphine treatment engagement (linkage and retention), opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], risk of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211], and post -intervention effects. The project will allow for the development and preliminary 
evaluation of a novel intervention to promote buprenorphine treatment engagement and adherence in out -
of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155].

3. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with proce dures, 
drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research ) 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_297773] a 
dramatic increase in overdose deaths (Wheeler et al., 2015; Wilkerson et al., 2016). In 2016 alone, more 
than 42,000 people died from a n overdose involving opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. This equates to approximately 116 opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-
related overdose deaths per day (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016), and recent data 
suggests that the opi[INVESTIGATOR_297774] (Ahmad et al., 2018).  
Maryland–where we will conduct this 
research –is among the top five states with the 
highest rates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_297775] (Seth, 
Scholl, Rudd, and Bacon, 2018). As shown in 
Figure 1, the number of people who have died from 
an opi[INVESTIGATOR_297776] 2009. Between 2015 and 2016, 
the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related deaths increased by 
70%, the largest single -year increase ever recorded 
(Maryland Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene, 2017) .     
The dramatic increase in overdose deat hs in 
Maryland has predominantly been attributed to 
heroin and the synthetic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] f entanyl. Between 2015 and 2016 the number of deaths involving heroin 
and fentanyl increased by 62% and 229%, respectively. The number of prescription -opi[INVESTIGATOR_297777] 19%; many of these deaths occurred in combination with heroin and/or fentanyl (Maryland 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2017) .    
Buprenorphine to Treat Opi[INVESTIGATOR_297778]  
A key driver of the overdose epi[INVESTIGATOR_297779]. 
The mu -opi[INVESTIGATOR_297780] (methadone), partial agonist (buprenorphine), and antagonist 
(naltrexone) are FDA -approved pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_297781]. Tre atment 
with these pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_297782], and are superior 
to non- medication -based approaches (Jarvis, Holtyn, et al., 2018; Krupi[INVESTIGATOR_9729]., 2011; Mattick, Breen, 
Kimber, and Davoli, 2009; 2014). Howe ver, methadone is highly regulated and can only be dispensed in 
federally approved opi[INVESTIGATOR_297783] (Connery, 2015). While naltrexone can be prescribed in 
office -based treatment settings, it precipi[INVESTIGATOR_297784] -dependent individuals so it can only be 
initiated in patients who have stopped opi[INVESTIGATOR_297785]. As a result, many individuals do not 
initiate treatment with naltrexone (Jarvis et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2017). Nearly 80% of the 2.1 million

 Americans with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_173668] e disorder are not in treatment (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and 
Quality, 2017; Wu, Zhu, & Swartz, 2016). Consequently, improving access to evidence -based treatment is 
an essential component of an effective response to the overdose epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]. 
Buprenorphine is the most accessible form of evidence- based opi[INVESTIGATOR_297786] (Jones, Campopi[INVESTIGATOR_5533], Baldwin, and 
McCance- Katz, 2015; Morgan, Schackman, Leff, Linas, and Wa lley, 2018) . Unlike methadone, 
buprenorphine can be prescribed in office -based treatment settings (provided a buprenorphine prescribing 
waiver is obtained). Office -based buprenorphine permits patients to receive medication by [CONTACT_297827], thereby [CONTACT_297828]. Due to its partial agonist properties, buprenorphine has limited respi[INVESTIGATOR_297787] (Lange, Fudala, Dax, and Johnson, 1990). At clinically effective doses, 
buprenorphine can protect against opi[INVESTIGATOR_297788]- opi[INVESTIGATOR_162223]. Furthermore, buprenorphine is often given in a formulation with naloxone that provides some 
protection aga inst misuse.  
Office -based buprenorphine treatment could be expanded substantially to treat many Americans 
with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_297789]. As of 2016, physicians who have an addiction 
specialty board certification or who have complete d an 8- hour course, and nurse practitioners and 
physician’s assistants who have completed an extended course, may receive a waiver to prescribe 
buprenorphine. Once approved to serve as a buprenorphine provider, medical professionals can prescribe 
many dose s of buprenorphine per prescription, often in 30- day supplies (Schuckit, 2016). 
Buprenorphine diversion . Because office -based buprenorphine providers can prescribe 30- day 
supplies of buprenorphine at a time and are not required to observe daily buprenorphi ne dosing (as is done 
in methadone maintenance treatment programs), buprenorphine doses can be diverted easily. Diversion 
increases the availability of illicit buprenorphine on the street, diminishes the effectiveness of office -based 
buprenorphine treatment, and increases the risk that buprenorphine providers may be contributing to 
problems associated with buprenorphine diversion. The risk of diversion also may limit the expansion of 
office -based buprenorphine treatment. Many eligible medical professionals do not apply for the waiver to 
become buprenorphine providers, and many providers do not prescribe to capacity (DeFlavio et al., 2015; 
Huhn and Dunn, 2017; Kundsen, 2015; Sharma et al., 2017). In surveys examining barriers to prescribing 
buprenorphine, physicians have raised concerns about illicit diversion of buprenorphine (Andrilla et al., 
2017; Johanson et al., 2012; Schuman‐ Olivier et al., 2013). Indeed, diversion of buprenorphine is a serious 
and growing concern (Cicero et al., 2014; Johanson et al., 2012). A recent large -scale, national survey 
reported that misuse of buprenorphine has increased substantially, and that over one -third of the 
buprenorphine misusers in the sample had used by [CONTACT_100305]; respondents reported that they 
had injecte d buprenorphine/naloxone tablets and film after using methods that they believed separated the 
buprenorphine from naloxone (Cicero et al., 2014).  
Retention of patients in buprenorphine treatment . Although buprenorphine can reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_297790], many patients enrolled in office -based buprenorphine treatment do 
not remain in treatment (for systematic reviews, see Mattick et al., 2014; Timko et al., 2016). In a recent 
multi- site, randomized controlled trial conducted by [CONTACT_297829] (Lee et al., 2017), only 
43% of participants remained in buprenorphine treatment over the 24- week trial. Rates of retention were 
similar in an earlier multi- site study with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -dependent adults, in which 46% of participants remaine d 
in buprenorphine treatment over a 24- week trial (Hser et al., 2014).  
Addressing the limitations of office -based buprenorphine treatment . Office -based buprenorphine 
could be an ideal pharmacotherapy in the movement to expand access to treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d use disorder 
and thereby [CONTACT_297830][INVESTIGATOR_103572], but it has two limitations that we plan to address in this

 application: 1) Buprenorphine that is prescribed by [INVESTIGATOR_44203] -based providers can be easily diverted for illicit 
use. 2) Many people in dire need of buprenorphine treatment do not initiate and remain in office -based 
buprenorphine treatment. 
Reducing Diversion through Video -Based Directly Observed Therapy (Video DOT)  
Methadone maintenance programs minimize the risk of diversion by [CONTACT_297831]. While effective in minimizing diversion, directly observed dosing is costly to both 
the providers and patients, and may be limited in scalability and long- term effectiveness. Office- based 
prescription of buprenor phine reduces the cost of administering opi[INVESTIGATOR_297791] a means of dramatically increasing our capacity to treat people with 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]. Fortunately, mobile technology can facilitate dire ctly observed dosing for 
buprenorphine treatment at a relatively low cost and thereby [CONTACT_297832]. 
emocha Mobile Health, Inc (emocha) has developed an innovative mobile health platform for 
facilitating medication adherence called Video DO T (see Figure 2 below). The fundamental component of 
Video DOT is asynchronous, video- based directly observed therapy in which patients can record and 
submit videos of themselves taking medication that are then viewable on a secure, web portal for treatment 
staff and providers to confirm medication adherence. Encrypted videos and data are transmitted to a 
secure, cloud -
based server 
within seconds 
and 
subsequently 
deleted from the 
patient’s mobile 
device. Staff and 
providers are 
then able to 
review videos 
(at any future time) to confirm adherence. Thus, Video DOT provides a novel and efficient way to 
remotely and objectively confirm medication adherence as well as safeguard against diversion. All data is 
encrypted on the phone, both in transmission and on the  server. Videos are deleted automatically upon 
uploading, ensuring privacy and confidentiality. emocha developed and validated their Video DOT system 
for promoting medication adherence in the treatment of tuberculosis and hepatitis C virus and currently 
offers their Video DOT system commercially to interested consumers. emocha has adapted its system to 
provide Video DOT for buprenorphine treatment and is pi[INVESTIGATOR_297792] (R44 DA044053). In collaboration with emocha, we will use their Video 
DOT system to ensure regular adherence to office -based buprenorphine treatment.  
Using Incentives to Increase Retention in Buprenorphine Treatment  
Many patients enrolled in office -based buprenorphine treatment do not remain in treatment (Mattick 
et al., 2014; Timko et al., 2016). In recent studies, less than half of the patients enrolled in office -based 
buprenorphine treatment remained in treatment for 24 weeks (Lee et al., 2017; Hser et al., 2014). 
However, discontinu ing buprenorphine treatment can increase the risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211] (Sordo et al., 
2017). To increase retention in buprenorphine treatment, we will offer patients behavioral economic 
incentives for taking scheduled doses of buprenorphine as verified by [CONTACT_297833]’s Video DOT system.

 suggests that incentives cou ld be very effective in promoting engagement and retention in buprenorphine 
treatment. That research shows that immediate consequences exert greater influence over behavior than 
delayed consequences (Bickel et al. 2014). The benefits of health behaviors li ke medication adherence or 
drug abstinence are often delayed, which may explain why these behaviors do not always maintain without 
special interventions. Incentive interventions are designed to bridge the gap between health behaviors and 
their naturally oc curring but delayed health benefits. Specifically, incentive interventions provide 
immediate incentives for health behaviors and thereby [CONTACT_297834].  
 Incentive interventions in the treatment of drug addiction. Incentive interventions have been highly 
effective in promoting abstinence from most commonly abused drugs, among other targets (Higgins, 
Silverman, and Heil, 2008). Reviews and meta -analyses suggest that incentive interventions, also called 
contingency management interventions, may be t he most effective psychosocial addiction treatments 
(Castells et al., 2009; Dutra et al., 2008; Knapp et al., 2007; Lussier et al., 2006; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_297794]., 2007) . 
Silverman (Co -Investigator on this project) showed that voucher incentives can increase abstine nce from 
cocaine (Silverman et al., 1996; 1998) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (Robles et al., 2002; Silverman, Wong, et al., 1996) in 
injection drug users in methadone treatment; and that increasing voucher values can initiate abstinence in 
refractory patients (Dallery et a l., 2001; Silverman et al., 1999). Holtyn ( Principal Investigator ) and 
Silverman ( Co-Investigator ) have shown that incentives can increase cocaine and opi[INVESTIGATOR_297795] o ut-
of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155] (Holtyn et a l., 2014a, b). As with other treatments, s ome patients relapse to drug 
use after an incentive intervention ends. To address relapse, Silverman has pi[INVESTIGATOR_297796] a maintenance intervention, and showed that incentives could maintain drug abstinence over time 
(Silverman et al., 2 012) for as long as one (DeFulio et al., 2009), three (Silverman et al., 2002) , and four 
(Aklin et al., 2014)  years.  
 Incentive i nterventions in promoting medication adherence . Particularly important to this 
application, i ncentive interventions have been effective in promoting adherence to pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_297797] (DeFulio and Silverman, 2012). Early  studies showed that voucher 
incentives could promote short -term adherence to oral naltrexone treatment in recently detoxified, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -
dependent adults (Carroll et al., 2001; Preston, Silverman, et al., 1999). In a series of studies, our team 
demonstrated that e mployment -based incentives can promote long- term use of extended- release (DeFulio 
et al., 2012; Everly et al., 2011) and oral (Dunn et al., 2013) naltrexone in heroin- dependent adults.  
The Target Population: Out -Of-Treatment Adults with Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5536] D isorder  
Out-of-treatment adults with opi[INVESTIGATOR_297798] (Degenhardt et 
al., 2009, 2011; Kimber et al., 2015; Sordo et al., 2017) and could benefit from expanded access and 
effective treatment with buprenorphine. The u se of emocha’s Video DOT system and incentives to provide 
buprenorphine treatment to out -of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_297799]. 
While emocha has begun to apply their Video DOT technology to the provision of buprenorphine 
treatment (under an SBIR grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, R44 DA044053; see above), 
they have focused their initial efforts on adults who are already in buprenorphine treatment and they have 
not incorporated incentives into the treatment. Out -of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_297800] (Booth, Crowley, and Zhang, 1996), but behavioral interventions have shown some promis e 
in engaging out -of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_297801] (Booth, Kwiatkowski, and Stephens, 1998; Kidorf 
et al., 2009). Particularly relevant to this application, Holtyn (PI) and colleagues have successfully 
recruited and enrolled out -of-treatment injectio n drug users into methadone treatment and used behavioral 
economic incentives to promote abstinence from opi[INVESTIGATOR_297802] (Holtyn et al. 2014a; Holtyn et al. 
2014b).

 The [LOCATION_002] is experiencing an epi[INVESTIGATOR_297767] -related overdose deaths. Office- based 
buprenorphine could expand access to buprenorphine treatment to the many opi[INVESTIGATOR_297768]. Ho wever, office -based buprenorphine has two 
limitations that we plan to address in this application: 1) Patients prescribed buprenorphine by [CONTACT_297835] -based medical professionals can easily divert the buprenorphine for illicit use. 2) Many people in 
dire need of buprenorphine treatment do not initiate and remain in office -based buprenorphine treatment. 
Video DOT is an innovative, patient -centered, mobile health platform that could facilitate adherence to 
buprenorphine treatment and safeguard against dive rsion. The addition of incentives could engage out -of-
treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_297804]. We propose to develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 
a novel combination of Video DOT and incentives to promote buprenorphine treatment engagement a nd 
adherence in out -of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155].  
The Proposed Plan 
Our proposed intervention will combine the commercially available Video DOT platform offered 
by [CONTACT_297836]. with an empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]- based incentive system – a combination we are cal ling 
“Video DOT+”. The incentive system will be based on extensive research on incentive interventions and 
will be similar to incentive systems that we have shown to be extremely effective in promoting medication 
adherence. The Video DOT+ intervention will  provide incentive sfor linking to buprenorphine treatment; 
facilitate retention in buprenorphine treatment via emocha’s Video DOT system and incentives for 
maintaining daily buprenorphine use; and add incentives remotely to reloadable credit cards. The inc entives 
will be integrated into the commercially available platform offered by [CONTACT_297837]+ system. We will evaluate this s ystem in out -of-treatment adults with opi[INVESTIGATOR_297805].  
Two randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_297806] [ADDRESS_363368] outreach, at agencies that serve the target population (e.g., The 
Baltimore City Health Department), word -of-mouth referrals , and by [CONTACT_297838] -free number in B altimore publications (e.g., the city paper) -- methods that we have used 
previously to recruit out -of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155]. Participants in Study 1 will be referred to buprenorphine 
treatment and randomly assigned to a Usual Care (Control) group or a Vi deo DOT+ group. Participants in 
Study 2 will be invited to participate in a 7- day induction period, and then randomly assigned to a Usual 
Care (Control) group or a Video DOT+ group. Video DOT+ participants will receive the Video DOT+ 
intervention being developed and evaluated in this project. We will assess participants every 4 weeks 
throughout a 24- week intervention period and at 12 weeks after the intervention ends. The long- term goal 
of this line of research is to develop and disseminate a sustainable an d scalable intervention that can 
promote buprenorphine treatment engagement and adherence, and thereby [CONTACT_297830][INVESTIGATOR_297807].

 staff at programs that serve the target population about the study and encourage them to refer potential 
participants to us. 2) We will post IRB -approved flyers and distribute business cards and information sheets 
with our toll -free number in each of these programs  and in Baltimore publicat ions (e.g., the city paper) . 3) 
As in our previous studies, participants  will have the option to earn incentives for referring people who are 
interested in the study. All interested individua ls will first complete a brief screening interview by 
[CONTACT_116622]- person to ensure general eligibility prior to a full- screening interview. Individuals who 
appear eligible based on the brief screening will be invited to complete the in -person informed consent 
process and full -screening interview.  
Standard Treatment Services  
Referrals to buprenorphine treatment.  All participants will be referred to receive office -based 
sublingual buprenorphine treatment either by [CONTACT_297839], based on participant preference. If the participant has a primary care provider and is interested in 
receiving buprenorphine from that provider, we will determine whether their provider is waivered to 
prescribe buprenorphine. We will use SAMHSA’s online Buprenorphine Treatment Practitioner Locator, 
which assists in finding physicians authorized to treat opi[INVESTIGATOR_297808] 
(SAMHSA, 2018). 
If the participant is unable to receive or uninterested in rec eiving buprenorphine treatment from 
their primary care provider, we will refer the participant to one of o ur collaborating programs (e.g., the 
Comprehensive Care Pra ctice and REACH Health Services).  
To facilitate access to buprenorphine, study physicians located at the Behavioral Pharmacology 
Research Unit (BPRU) on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Campus may provide buprenorphine 
prescriptions to participants in this study.  
Referrals to other treatment services.  All participants will be referred to additional services, as 
needed, by [CONTACT_297840], housing, job- skills training, 
food assistance, and entitlement services.  
STUDY 1  
Computer -Based Education Program  
Upon enrollment in Study 1, participants wil l be taught about the available medication -assisted 
treatments (buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone) for opi[INVESTIGATOR_297809] a computer -based education  program. All participants wh o are eligible for S tudy 
1 will be invited to complete the computer- based program. After participants complete the computer- based 
program, they will be rand omly assigned to a study group (as described in detail below).  
Course Content. The content of the c omputer -based education program was developed using 
information from SAMHSA ( Opi[INVESTIGATOR_297810] ). The computer -based program wa s divided into three courses that differ by [CONTACT_297841]. Course 1 
defines opi[INVESTIGATOR_297811]. Course 2 provides training on opi[INVESTIGATOR_297812], prevention, and identification, and “do’s and don’ts ” of responding to an overdose. Course 
3 provides training on the three FDA -approved medications for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] ( buprenorphine, 
methadone, and naltrexone), including when, where, and how these medications are typi[INVESTIGATOR_187615].  
Computer -Based Education Program. Each of the three courses are  divided into 12 Modules 
consisting of Presentation and Mastery Units. Presentation Units were designed to introduce new material, 
while Mastery Units allow participants to practice answering questions about that material. Each Mastery 
Unit consists of a series of question screens with multiple -choice questions about the content in the 
previous Presentation Unit. Question screens may be presented in random order in a one -minute practice

 trial (i.e., “timing”). Participants can  earn $2.00 for completing each of the 12 Modules and $0.[ADDRESS_363369] response during a timing. T hus, t otal earnings for participating in the computer- based training will 
depend on the speed and accuracy with which participant s answer questions  during the timings . In our prior 
computer -based training study, participants answered 15 questions correctly per minute in Mastery Units, 
on average (Subramanian et a l., 201 9). Based on this, w e estimate that participants will earn up to about 
$33 for participating in the computer -based training ( [ADDRESS_363370] responses per Mastery 
Unit x $0.[ADDRESS_363371] response ; 12 Modules x $2.00 for completing eac h Module ).    
Knowledge Test s. We will evaluate effectiveness of the computer -based education program by 
[CONTACT_297842]. We may re -administer 
the test at the end of the main study to mea sure retention. A [ADDRESS_363372] (see Section 20, 
Supplemental Study Documents for a copy of the  questions from the Knowledge Test ) will be used to 
assess performance prior to and following training in each of the three courses  – participants will complete 
the test four times. The test consists of multiple -choice questions with two to four response options. 
Participants will be able to  earn $0.[ADDRESS_363373]  for a total of up to 
$[ADDRESS_363374] score (number of 
correct/incorrect responses and amount of incentives earned) after completing each administration of the 
test. Participants will not be provided with feedback on their responses to each question in the test.  
Evaluation Strategy. We will use  a multiple -probe design to evaluate learning in the education 
program. The program is divided into three courses and the Knowledge T est of content from all three 
courses will be delivered before and aft er participants complete each course. Each participant will complete 
the 50- item test described above four times (Test 1, Test 2, Test 3, and Test 4). Participants will be asked to 
complete Test [ADDRESS_363375] will increase following  completion of each course . 
Experimental Design  
Participants  will be randomly assigned to a Usual Care Control or Video DOT+ group. A 
computerized urn randomization procedure (Wei & Lachin, 1988) will be used to randomize participants 
and to balance groups on two baseline characteristics that may influence outcome: (1) sex (male/female) 
and (2) intake urine sample positive for cocaine (Yes/No). Participants will be stratified based on sex and 
evidence of cocaine use because each has been associated with buprenorphine treatment outcomes (Marsch 
et al., 2005; Sullivan et a l., 2010). While it might be desirable to stratify on other variables, increasing the 
number of variables is not practical given the sample size proposed for this study.  
STUDY 2  
Computer -Based Education Program  
Upon enrollment in Study 2, participants wil l be taught how to use the Video DOT application 
through a computer -based education program. All participants who are eligible for Study 2 will be invited 
to complete the computer- based program. After participants complete the computer- based program, they 
will be invited to participate in a 7 -day smartphone induction period (as described in detail below).  
Course Content. The content of the computer -based program was developed using screenshots of 
the different sections of the study smartphone app. The progr am teaches participants the main functions of 
each setting in the app while using the screenshots as a visual aid.  
Computer -Based Education Program. The course  is divided into Modules consisting of

Experimental Desig n 
Participants will be randomly assigned to a Usual Care Control or Video DOT+ group. A 
computerized urn randomization procedure (Wei & Lachin, 1988) will be used to randomize participants 
and to balance groups on two baseline characteristics that may infl uence outcome: (1) sex (male/female) 
and (2) intake urine sample positive for cocaine (Yes/No). Participants will be stratified based on sex and 
evidence of cocaine use because each has been associated with buprenorphine treatment outcomes (Marsch 
et al., 2005; Sullivan et al., 2010). While it might be desirable to stratify on other variables, increasing the 
number of variables is not practical given the sample size proposed for this study.  
Buprenorphine Induction 
Participants will be offered a supervised buprenorphine induction at the Behavioral Pharmacology 
Research Unit  (BPRU)  on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center Campus . Participants will receive 
incremental doses of buprenorphine throughout the day, up to a maximum of 24mg of buprenorphine on the  
induction day. The induction protocol will be conducted as clinically indicated, based upon medical team 
recommendations. To increase comfort during the induction, the medical team may administer the 
concomitant medications described in Section 6 ( Drugs/S ubstances/Devices). Participants may then be 
maintained on buprenorphine as an outpatient for up to [ADDRESS_363378] . Participants who are maintained on 
buprenorphine as a n outpatient will receive blister packages of sublingual buprenorphine for outpatient 
administration and may receive up to 24mg/day (beginning the day after induction) during this period. T he 
highest potential dose (24mg) is below what can be administered for use on a daily basis (32mg).  
Participants will be required to visit the BPRU on a weekly basis to exchange blister packages.

 prescription for buprenorphine  from a community provider. We selected this incentive value because it has 
been highly effective in linking indi viduals to treatment at community programs in our ongoing controlled 
trial (R01AI117065). This incentive value is also similar to the incentive value in a prior study ($50) shown 
to be effective at linking out -of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_297813] (Kidorf et al., 2009). 
Video DOT+ for facilitating sublingual buprenorphine adherence. Participants will have the Video 
DOT+ application installed on their personal smartphones/tablets and will receive in -person training by 
[CONTACT_464], during which they will be taught how to use the application. The participant will use Video 
DOT+ to record a video of the buprenorphine administration process. Each video will be uploaded into the 
provider -facing web portal, which can be securely accessed by [CONTACT_3647]. Staff can verify each video to 
confirm that the video shows the correct person and that the buprenorphine dose was administered 
appropriately. Participants will be able to earn daily incentives  for taking their buprenorphine dose and 
submitting a valid video recording of administration  before mid night . In Study 1, participants will be able 
to earn $10 per day and in Study 2, participants will be able to earn $[ADDRESS_363381] (in -person) observation.  
Immediate feedback . If the participant takes his/her buprenorphine dose and submits a video within 
the allowed window (i.e., before m idnight), the last screen of the application will be a congratulatory 
message and they will receive an in -app notification once their submission has been assessed that visualizes 
their earnings for the day. Patients will be able to visualize their adherenc e and earnings over time on a 
dashboard within the application.  
Validation of video of sublingual buprenorphine  administration. A  research team  member will 
review the videos to confirm the participant took his/her buprenorphine dose appropriately. The val idation 
process will occur on a staff computer using the provider -facing web portal. First, the program will display 
a previously obtained photo of the participant alongside the video to confirm that the correct person 
provided the sample. The staff member  will confirm that the person in the video matches the photo of the 
participant. If the person in the video matches the photo of the participant, the staff member will view the 
video to determine if the participant correctly administered his/her buprenorph ine dose.  
Buprenorphine dosing reminders . During the initial in -person training, study staff will ask 
participants to select at what time they will take their buprenorphine dose each day. The selected time will 
be programed into the application by [CONTACT_3449] s taff. Then, the Video DOT+ platform will send an automatic 
SMS reminder to participants who have not yet submitted videos by [CONTACT_297843]. In those 
instances, the following message will be displayed: “Please remember to take your buprenor phine dose.”  
 Reset in the incentive magnitude for a missed video or invalid buprenorphine  administration. If  a 
participant fails to submit a video or if a submitted video is deemed invalid, the participant will not receive 
the scheduled incentive amount that day and the daily incentive value will be decreased to $ 1 per day. Then, 
the amount earned per day will increase to the maximum incentive value (Study 1: $10; Study 2: $20)  after 
the participant submits a valid video of buprenorphine  administration ev ery day for seven days.  
Reloadable credit card. At the start of enrollment, each participant will be given a reloadable credit 
card. After the staff member verifies that participants correctly ingested their buprenorphine dose, any 
incentive earnings will  be added to the card. Each card can then be used as a regular credit card to make 
purchases at most businesses. We currently use this reloadable credit card system in our ongoing incentive 
programs, and it has proven very efficient and highly acceptable t o participants.  
Contesting the validation decision. Participants will be able to contest the validation decision of a 
staff monitor via the Video DOT+ application. Participants will be taught how to contest the validation

participants who report being in buprenorphine treatment, the TLFB procedure will be used to elicit 
participants’ self -reported taking of their buprenorphine dose each day. Pharmacy and/or clinic records 
(with participant permission) may be used to confirm self -reported data.

 adherence. We will assess the number of days participants report taking their daily buprenorphine dose 
during the 30 days prior to each of the 4- week assessments during the 24 -week intervention evaluation 
period (based on TLFB).  Hypothesis:  We expect that Video DOT+ participants will have more days of 
taking their buprenorphine dose as prescribed during the  24-week intervention relative to the Usual Care 
Control participants.  
  Specific aim. Assess efficacy of Video DOT+ in promoting linkage to buprenorphine treatment. We 
will assess the percentage of participants who link to buprenorphine treatment during t he 24- week 
intervention evaluation period (Yes/No, based on self -report and medical records). Hypothesis:  We expect 
that more  Video DOT+ participants will link to buprenorphine treatment during the 24- week intervention 
relative to the Usual Care Control pa rticipants.  
  Specific aim. Assess efficacy of Video DOT+ in promoting retention in buprenorphine treatment. We 
will assess the total number of days participants are in buprenorphine treatment from the time of 
randomization until the last day of medication during the 24- week intervention evaluation period (based on 
self-report and medical records). Hypothesis:  We expect that Video DOT+ participants will be retained in 
buprenorphine treatment for more days during the 24- week intervention relative to the Usua l Care Control 
participants.  
  Specific aim. Assess efficacy of Video DOT+ in reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].  We will assess the percentage of 
participants with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -positive urine samples (excluding buprenorphine and methadone if self -report and 
medical records co nfirm that the participant is enrolled in buprenorphine or methadone treatment) at the 4 -
week assessments during the 24 -week intervention evaluation period (Yes/No at each assessment).  
Hypothesis:  We expect that Video DOT+ participants will have fewer opio id-positive urine samples during 
the 24- week intervention relative to the Usual Care Control participants.  
  Specific aim. Assess efficacy of Video DOT+ in reducing risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211]. We will assess the 
rates at which participants report engaging in overdose risk behaviors at the 4 -week assessments during the 
24-week intervention evaluation period (based on total scores from the opi[INVESTIGATOR_297818]). 
Hypothesis:  We expect that  Video DOT+ participants will engage in lower rates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_297819] 24 -week intervention relative to Usual Care Control.  
  Specific aim. Assess efficacy of Video DOT+ in promoting buprenorphine treatment engagement and 
adherence, and reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_297820]. We will assess 
these outcomes at the 12 -week follow -up after the intervention ends. Hypothesis:  We expect that Video 
DOT+ participants will have better buprenorphine treatment outcomes relative to the Usual Care Control 
participants aft er the intervention ends.  
 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim data analysis.  
Statistical Analyses  
Separate statistical analyses will be conducted for Study 1 and Study 2, using the procedures 
described below.   
We will analyze measures assessed repeatedly over time with a longitudinal logistic regression 
model. Within -person correlated outcomes will be handled using generalized estimating equations (GEE; 
Zeger, Liang, & Albert, 1988). Measures assessed once will be analyzed us ing logistic regression. The 
magnitude of effects will be expressed using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Retention in 
buprenorphine treatment during the [ADDRESS_363388] the intent -to-treat analyses for covariates used for stratification 
(Pocock, Assmann, Enos, & Kasten, 2002). Tests will be two -sided and, because we have one primary 
outcome, alpha will be set at 0.05.  
Primary outcome analyses . The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of participants 
with buprenorphine -positive urine samples at the 4 -week assessments during the 24 -week intervention

 evaluation period (Y/N at each assessment). We will fit a longitudinal logistic regression model log it (Y ij) = 
β0+ β 1tx + β 2-3x2-3+εij, where Y ij is evidence of buprenorphine adherence for the ith person at the jth 
timepoint (6 visits over 24 weeks), β [ADDRESS_363389] ≥85% of the study assessments . Our primary approach to handle 
missing data will be to impute missing values as the adverse outcome (e.g., buprenorphine -negative urine 
sample). Model parameter  estimates from this approach will be compared to a method without imputation. 
If these methods yield differing results, conclusions will need to be tentative, but results from both 
approaches will be reported in publications. To investigate sensitivity to  missing values, participants with 
and without missing values will be compared by [CONTACT_297847]. If rates are higher than 
expected, we may use mixed effects models rather than GEE estimation, as the former has less strict 
assumptions rega rding missing data (missing at random, rather than missing completely at random). If the 
data are missing not at random, then we will fit pattern mixture models as described by [CONTACT_297848] (1997). 
Power Analyses  
We used Liu and Liang (1997) to det ermine the number of participants required to detect a 
difference between groups with 80% power. The adjacent figure shows the total number of participants (N) 
that would be required to detect a difference of 25% 
between the Usual Care Control and Video DO T+ 
groups with the six assessments during the 24- week 
intervention period. The figure shows different 
percentages for the Usual Care Control  group 
because that value affects the sample size required. 
Twenty -five percent is smaller than the increase 
produce d in our prior study of incentives to 
promote daily adherence to oral naltrexone in 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- dependent adults (Dunn et al., 2013). It is 
also smaller than the incentive effects in promoting 
drug abstinence, medication adherence, and other 
health behaviors as shown in three different meta -
analyses (Petry et al., 2012; Prendergast et al. 2006; 
Lussier et al., 2006). Based on this, we need to randomize 64 participants (horizontal dashed line) to detect 
a difference between the Usual Care Control and the Video DO T+ groups on the primary outcome measure.

This study involve s the development and evaluation of a behavioral intervention to promote uptake 
of and adherence to an FDA -approved medication (sublingual buprenorphine) for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]. 
Buprenorphine  has very few contraindications, but is  not recommended for use with the opi[INVESTIGATOR_297821]. It is rated in pregnancy category C, therefore all women who are 
pregnant or nursing will be excluded from study particip ation. Buprenorphine’s  side effects are minimal 
and rare (hyperhidrosis  14%, abdominal pain 11%, constipation 12%, nausea 15%, headache 37%, 
insomnia 14%)  and overlap significantly with known opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801] (e.g., abdominal pain, 
nausea).  It is expected that participants may experience some level of opi[INVESTIGATOR_297822]. Symptoms of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_297823], diarrhea or stomach crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], muscle aches and pains, yawning, 
sweating, pupil dilation, minor increases in blood pressure, and runny nose/tearing eyes. To help to 
alleviate these symptoms, the study clini cian co -investigat or(s) who are conducting the supervised 
buprenorphine induction  may offer participants  the concomitant medications listed in Section 6.  
The study poses little risk to participants and offers the potential of substantial benefit. There is 
essentially no risk above those of normal daily living associated with the incentives, or with the data 
collection procedures proposed in this study.  
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
To protect confidentiality, all research participants are identified b y participant identification codes 
(Participant IDs) consisting of their initials and sequentially -assigned participant numbers on most forms 
and data files, and not by [CONTACT_2249]. All research data are stored in locked areas accessible only to 
research s taff and are not left unattended. Documents with confidential information are shredded before 
being discarded. Confidential information is never given to anyone outside of the research program without 
the explicit written permission of the research participant. Only selected designated staff members are 
approved to give confidential information out after obtaining explicit written permission from the 
participant. All research staff are trained in these procedures. We collect only general information about 
participant activities, legal and illegal. We do not collect information about specific illegal acts. Finally and 
importantly, the Video DOT+ application that will be used to provide monitoring of adherence and 
incentives has features that promote compliance with HIPAA.  
Buprenorphine has been approved for use by [CONTACT_297850]. Participants will be referred to our collaborating primary care providers to receive 
buprenorphine treatment. In addition, the exclusion cri teria were selected to minimize the risks associated 
with buprenorphine treatment. If a participant becomes pregnant while in the study, she will be referred for

 medical treatment in an appropriate medical clinic (e.g., a specialty clinic for pregnant wome n who abuse 
drugs).  
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations.  
Unanticipated problems or study deviations will be reported based on the guidelines of the Johns 
Hopkins University School of Medicine IRB.  
 
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
There are risks that the confidential information we collect could be revealed to people not involved 
in the research such as a friend, relative, or an outside organization. This could be embarrassing to the 
participant if the participant wanted to keep participation in the study secret. The legal risks are limited 
because we collect only general information about participant activities, legal and illegal. We do not collect 
information about specific illegal acts. Thus, the risks associated with the assessments are not greater than 
the risks associated with routine psychological examinations or tests.  
 
e. Financial risks to the participants.  
There are no financial risks above those of normal daily living.   Each participant is responsible for 
ensuring that the earnings are reported properly to relevant government or private agencies and for 
determining whether or not the earnings will affect any benefits they might receive from those agencies.  
 
9. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits  for the participant and for society . 
All participants will be offered referrals to buprenorphine treatment, which could help to reduce 
their opi[INVESTIGATOR_297824]. Participants in the experimental gr oup will receive 
access to our customized mobile- health application that could facilitate adherence to buprenorphine 
treatment. If the proposed intervention is an effective means of promoting buprenorphine treatment 
engagement and adherence, it could reduc e the substantial morbidity, mortality, and societal healthcare 
costs associated with untreated opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427].   
 
10. Payment and Remuneration  
a. Detail compensation for participant s including possible total compensation, proposed bonus, 
and any proposed re ductions or penalties for not completing the protocol.  
All incentives in this study will be provided by [CONTACT_297851]. We have been using these reloadable credit cards in our ongoing 
research and they have proved attractive to participants and convenient for staff to manage. Payment for 
participating in Study 1 and Study 2 are described in detail below.

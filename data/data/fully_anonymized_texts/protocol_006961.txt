1.Statement  of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be  tested.
The purpose of this study is to develop an interactive tool to screen for Elder Mistreatment (EM) in the 
emergency department. EM is a major public health problem with prevalence estimate ranges from 7.6% to 
12.7% among older adults. EM causes serious adverse outcomes for its victims including injury, increased 
service utilization, mental distress and increased mortality. A major barrier in overcoming EM is the inability 
to accurately identify EM victims. It is estimated that only 1 in 24 cases become known to authorities. This is 
problematic as older adults are not likely to report that they are being mistreated. To improve the screening 
for EM and promote self-disclosure we will study the Feasibility of Virtual cOaching in making Informed 
Choices on Elder Mistreatment Self-Disclosure (VOICES). The overarching aim of this project is to develop 
VOICES that runs on tablet and is used by [CONTACT_79650]. VOICES will utilize virtual 
coaching, interactive multimedia libraries (e.g. graphics, video clips, animations, etc.), techniques form 
electronic screening for intimate partner violence, and brief motivational interviewing designed to enhance 
identifying EM among older adults. This project includes developi[INVESTIGATOR_79614], as well as a 
study to examine the feasibility of complex interventions in real-world settings.
The scientific aims are:
Aim 1. Tool  Development: To develop and refine the interactive VOICES tool, which will promote self- 
identification and self-disclosure to increase reporting of EM at point-of-care in the ED setting.
Aim 2. Feasibility Study: To conduct a feasibility study (N= 800) examining the use of VOICES in a 
busy ED.
Aim 3. Exploratory  Aim: To perform a preliminary evaluation of the accuracy of VOICES as a 
screening tool in correctly classifying EM cases that were referred to Adult Protective Services (APS).

3.Background:  Describe  the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
Magnitude of Problem: Elder mistreatment (EM) is a major public health problem with prevalence estimate 
ranges from 7.6% to 12.7% among older adults.1,[ADDRESS_86920], such as Adult Protective 
Services (APS), specifically designed to support older adults who have been subjected to mistreatment.
However, it is estimated only [ADDRESS_86921] victims of EM from turning into a health inequity, more 
research is needed to examine the complex causes and consequences of elder mistreatment to inform the 
future design of evidence-based guidelines on screening for individuals at risk of mistreatment in the older 
adult population. 2,4-8 Therefore, we will study the feasibility of Virtual cOaching in making Informed Choices 
on Elder Mistreatment Self-Disclosure (VOICES), as a strategy for increasing identification of victims of EM.
Empowering Older  Adults with tools to help  them self-identify  and self-disclose EM is significant: There 
is a literature gap in the research to support older adults in making decisions about self-disclosure (informing 
others about the EM experiences) of mistreatment. Victimized older adults often are not likely to disclose that 
they are being mistreated, despi[INVESTIGATOR_79615] a general understanding of what constitutes mistreatment behavior.[ADDRESS_86922] older adults say if they were a victim and were to ask for help they would go to a family 
member as they aren’t aware of the professional services available to them. VOICES will close this gap by 
[CONTACT_79651]. In addition, it will 
educate older adults on common misunderstandings of the EM response processes, that are usually the main 
barriers to self-disclosure.
Barriers to Effective EM Screening: All efforts-to-date are focused on increasing identification of EM 
victims by [CONTACT_79652][INVESTIGATOR_79616]. Provider performed screening processes are important, 
however, the alternative approach we propose seeks to include the older adults in the screening process. We 
are aiming to empower them to be their own advocates and to be able to scale to the increase in demand for 
such service since 25% of the U.S. population will be age 60 or older by 2030.5 Additionally, it was reported 
that healthcare providers generally rely on patient self-reporting.6 Integrating Health Information Technology 
(HIT) into point-of-care visits for screening, brief intervention, and referral to APS addresses provider 
barriers of time, training (by [CONTACT_79653]), resources (by [CONTACT_79654]), and 
satisfaction (a senior-friendly tool).
ED Visit for EM Screening: In other areas of mistreatment research such as intimate partner violence (IPV) 
and child abuse and neglect, the ED is the standard catchment area and the health care providers are 
gatekeepers for screening for all types of mistreatment.7-[ADDRESS_86923] of these victims the ED visit could be the only opportunity for them to get help.

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/16/2020Page [ADDRESS_86924] of VOICES can help identify those who do not, will not, or cannot speak on their own 
behalf and be their own voice.
HIT Success in Screening IPV and Child Abuse: Advances in computer-based IPV screening at the ED has 
been demonstrated to produce significantly higher rates of reporting (19% with the tool vs. 10% with a paper 
survey vs. <1% usual ED care) and has made routine screening for high-risk activities easier to report.15 Other 
studies show that computer-based tools for instances of IPV among women ED patients increased the rates of 
domestic violence discussion between patient and physician (56% vs. 45%), disclosure (14% vs. 8%), and 
services provided (8% vs. 4%).16 Digital tools which offer the opportunity to confidentially self-disclose risky 
or stigmatize behavior or treatment significantly increase the opportunity of identification.
Older-Adults Centered-Framework:  Little has been done to support older adults in making decisions about 
self-disclosure of victimization or to support their help-seeking behaviors. This study is innovative because it 
focuses on the older adults themselves. This project will instigate a paradigm shift by [CONTACT_79655], rather than the healthcare provider, through 
the use of a patient-centered virtual-coaching digital health app. Currently, only patients  with clear signs  of abuse 
and neglect get the in-person screening from their provider or social worker. One of the innovations, in our 
approach includes: standardization of intervention delivery and greater efficiency and use of limited resources 
in U.S. EDs. The anonymity supported by [CONTACT_79656]- 
disclosure of sensitive or taboo subjects. In addition, we believe older adult’s  input is vital to understanding  this 
sensitive topic, therefore we included three older adults  on our research team as Co-researchers. An important 
innovative aspect of this proposed framework is that it is easily modifiable to create culturally appropriate 
versions and easily replicable in other care settings. Although the first version will be in English, the software 
architecture and development techniques will allow us (with minimal effort) to produce multilingual versions 
of VOICES (e.g. Spanish). The language adaptable screens and the automated text-to-speech models will be 
able to produce text and audio in different  languages. We are also hopi[INVESTIGATOR_79617] a version of the tool designed 
specifically for patients that are blind, have low vision, are deaf, or are hard of hearing. 
Innovative use  of the Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI): This is a specialized “brief intervention” for the 
medical setting based on motivational interviewing techniques. The BNI has been effective in promoting a 
variety of positive help-seeking behavior  changes.  In this project, the purpose of the BNI is to assist patients to 
self-disclose experiences of abuse and/or neglect. Patients who screen with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_79618]-disclose EM to their providers  will receive  an automated BNI to motivate  them to self-disclose. VOICES is 
innovative in delivering the BNI with the virtual coach. By [CONTACT_79657], BNI, and virtual  coaching VOICES is 
a complete process of screening and intervening, not just a screening tool.

The purpose of this study is to develop the tool “VOICES” and pi[INVESTIGATOR_79623]. This study will 
utilize best practices, advances, and innovations in the design and development of digital health tools. It 
incorporates evidence HIT research and lessons learned from evidence-based IPV practices to build a tool 
that will increase help-seeking behaviors associated with better patient outcomes. As an easy-to-use senior-
friendly HIT tool, VOICES will run on an iPad and the information and messages are displayed on the screen 
and spoken through headphones for patient privacy. We will build VOICES to promote help-seeking 
behaviors among victims of EM by [CONTACT_79660]-identification of victimization and supporting decisions 
regarding self-disclosure to increase reporting of EM. We will conduct three focus groups to enhance the 
initial concept and improve the content of the tool. The first focus group will have four older adult 
participants, two caregivers, two ED providers, and two ED social workers. The second and third focus 
groups will have 6-8 older adult participants in each. Participants for the focus group will be English speaking 
and age 60+ and one of the focus group will also include two caregivers, two ED providers, and two social 
workers from the YNHH-ED. They will be asked questions about what features are important when designing 
a mistreatment screening tool for older adults? They will also be asked how should the educational content be 
designed to help motivate older adults? At the end of the focus group session, participants will be asked to 
complete a brief survey. It will be completely voluntary, and all surveys are anonymous. We will have an 
envelope at designated area in the room from the focus group where the participate can leave their survey.
Surveys will be stored in a locked cabinet in our locked office. Participants will be told that their information 
is confidential. Participants will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_86926]. In our approach for Aim 1, we make a

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/16/2020Page [ADDRESS_86927] a 
study with eight hundred (N=800) eligible participants in order to evaluate the feasibility of implementing this 
innovative screening process into the ED with older adults. We will conduct the feasibility study across five 
important areas including: acceptability, demand,
implementation, practicality, and limited efficacy. 
In
 Aim 3, we perform a preliminary evaluation of 
the accuracy of VOICES as a screening tool in 
correctly identifying EM cases that were referred to 
APS. Finally, we will analyze the data, disseminate 
findings, and plan a study to test the effectiveness of 
VOICES in more diverse, multilingual, and multi- 
center settings throughout the country that allows 
for assessment of impact on outcomes.
Ethical issues and  the unique challenges. We pay 
special attention to the ethical issues and the unique 
challenges of EM research and to consenting and 
enrolling the elderly in our study. We designed a 
detailed process on how to evaluate capacity, 
determine competence, and obtain informed consent 
from older adults. Evaluating the capacity of the 
participants to understand the purpose, risks, 
benefits, confidentiality, and privacy associated 
with this study is vital for valid informed consent.
We will use standardized criteria to determine if the 
potential
 participant is capable of providing 
consent. Members of the study team who are
responsible for participant recruitment and consent will be highly trained in obtaining informed consent. They 
will receive training by [CONTACT_79661]. 
Ability to provide informed consent will be assessed using the Abbreviated Mental Test 4 (AMT-4) to assess 
cognitive status designed to assess decision-making capacity for research participation according to NIH 
standards. Additionally, we will employ evidence-based practices from the fields of IPV and geriatrics to 
correctly address these challenges. While at the initial stages in our research, we will focus on older adults 
who are alerted and oriented, our future plans include patients suffering from cognitive impairments. We are 
only excluding them at this early stage of the research, to demonstrate proof of concept through a traditional 
highly controlled research design. This sequencing approach is in line with the NIA stage model for 
behavioral interventions.
AIM 1:  App Development: To develop, test, and refine the interactive VOICES which will promote self- 
identification and self-disclosure to increase reporting of EM at the point-of-care setting.
We will  build the tool VOICES to promote help-seeking behaviors among victims of EM by [CONTACT_79660]- 
identification of victimization and supporting decisions regarding self-disclosure to increase reporting of EM. In 
the software  development,  we will ensure that VOICES  has a senior-friendly, self-driven, and step-by-step interface 
that seamlessly engages  seniors  in the screening process. The way older adults  use technology is different, and 
VOICES will satisfy the highest  standard for usability, accessibility, and acceptability as stated in “Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0”, to ensure effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. We will develop a 
digital informed consent process that pays special  attention to the ethical  issues and the unique challenges posed by 
[CONTACT_79662]. This digital informed consent process will cover all aspects of the consent and utilize 
multimedia, animation, audio and visual components to enhance the participants’ understanding of the study. The 
consent process will be performed on an iPad, and developed with the same user-friendly and target population

guarantee the confidentiality  and privacy of the patient and clinical information.

model, and requirements. We will adapt the User-Centered Design (UCD) approach to develop VOICES, that is, 
an iterative multi-stage design approach  which involves  the user’s input throughout  the development process.  UCD 
gives extensive attention to the user’s needs, wants and limitations at each stage of the design process and allows 
User Experience (UX) evaluations to be incorporated into the design. We will conduct  a series  of older adults’ UX 
evaluations that map on to the development cycle, i.e., user requirements analysis, conceptual design, detailed 
design, implementation, quality assurance testing, launch and maintenance.  The result  will be a tool that is built and 
optimized around how older adults can, want, or need to use it.
SPECIFIC AIM 2 (Feasibility Study): To conduct a feasibility study examining the use of VOICES in a 
busy ED.
In this Aim, we  will conduct a study with eight hundred (N=800) eligible participants in order to evaluate the 
feasibility of implementing this innovative screening process into the ED with older adults. Our study will be 
designed based on rigorous scientific methods and will enable us to produce unbiased experimental design, 
methodology, analysis, interpretation and reporting of results. We expect this project will lead to a future 
comparative effectiveness research study comparing (VOICES + in-person screening) to the standard-of-care (in- 
person screening) in EM. Currently, patients with clear signs  of abuse and neglect get the in-person  screening from 
their provider or social worker. The advantages to our approach, in addition to the in-person approach, includes: 
standardization of intervention delivery and greater efficiency and use of limited resources in a busy ED. The 
anonymity supported by [CONTACT_79656]-disclosure of sensitive or 
taboo subjects.
Study Setting: The Department of Emergency Medicine (DEM) at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) will serve as 
the study sites. Subjects for VOICES study will be recruited from the large and diverse patient population that 
visit the Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79624]'s Campus (YNHH-ED-SRC).
Screening/Data Collection  Description:  The anticipated process  for the screening and data collection is as follows 
and expected to take [ADDRESS_86929] the older adult with putting on the headphones;  orient them to the iPad screen, and explain the process  that 
will follow. First, participants will complete a demographic pre-survey. Next, they will begin VOICES with an 
interactive educational session about EM and APS response, and will be screened for EM. For participants who 
screen positive, VOICES will ask them if they would like to self-disclose. If they choose to disclose VOICES will 
stop and thank them for participating. If they choose not to disclose EM, they will then complete the BNI and be 
asked again if they  would like to self-disclose.
VOICES is not intended to replace the existing protocols for handling EM in EDs. Rather it is intended to help 
screen and identify cases of suspected EM that otherwise will be missed. The established protocol at YNHHS 
when EM is suspected requires notifying the ED social worker who will conduct an in-person evaluation and 
decide on the best approach to handle the case. VOICES will first screen for EM and administer an interactive 
educational session. It will then ask if the older adult would like to self-Identify with EM. If the patient does not 
want to self-identify, VOICES will administer BNI and ask again if the older adult want to self-identify with EM. 
If the patient chooses to identify with EM, the research assistant (RA) will notify the provider/social worker and 
say, “The patient wants to disclose EM”. When the older adult is finished they will signal to the RA who will 
collect the iPad, complete a brief post-survey, administer the $20.00 incentive and (if needed) will notify their 
provider.

Data Analysis,  Measurement and Analysis of Outcomes: The purpose of this Objective is to understand 
important areas of feasibility, including acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, and limited efficacy 
(Table 1). Data  for the completion of this Objective  comes from  the following sources:  (1) Participant demographic 
data obtained on pre-survey, (2) participant responses given to questions during VOICES (EM screener, self- 
identification, self-disclosure), (3) participant responses on participant satisfaction given to questions on post- 
survey, and (4) observations made by [CONTACT_79663], VOICES administration, and data collection for each 
participant.
For the  data collected during VOICES completion, the exact phrasing of the self-identification and self-disclosure 
questions will be decided  upon during  completion of Objective  1 following the focus  groups and expert  interviews. 
For the EM screener used in VOICES to determine whether there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_79625], we 
will use the Self-Administrated Elder Abuse Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_79626] (EASI-sa) 5-item scale which asks about items 
related to physical and psychological aggression. The EASI-sa has adequate internal. In our study design and 
analysis, we will observe and report sex-based data. Moreover, we will look for differences on how sex and other 
biological variables, such as age, weight, and underlying health conditions, plays role in the outcome and the 
percentage of older adult that chooses to self-disclose  EM.
Data analysis  will be conducted with help of the Yale Center for Analytic Sciences (YCAS and will be performed 
using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Analysis of feasibility  will be primarily descriptive. Numeric summaries 
including frequencies for categorical outcomes and means, medians, standard deviations and interquartile ranges 
for continuous feasibility outcomes will be presented. Graphical summaries will be used to describe distributions 
of outcomes and relations of outcomes with baseline characteristics. 95% confidence intervals for means and 
proportions will be estimated to describe uncertainty from sampling variation for feasibility outcomes.

In this  exploratory aim, we will evaluate the positive predictive value of VOICES as a screening tool in correctly 
identifying EM cases. This could serve as preliminary test for the accuracy of VOICES in correctly classifying 
victims/non-victims. It  will be estimated  through  the measure of positive predictive value  (PPV) using the APS case 
outcomes as the gold standard comparison.

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/16/2020Page 11 of 30Design and rational:
In Connecticut,  reported cases of EM are investigated by [CONTACT_79670] (PSE), commonly 
known as APS, which is administered by [CONTACT_79671] (please see letter of support). PSE is designed to safeguard people age 60 and older from EM. 
Pursuant to State Code 2012-R-0437, mandatory reporters are able to know outcomes of their report (see letter of 
support from PSE). If a case was opened by [CONTACT_79672]’s determined threshold for a 
situation requiring an investigation so reporting was valid. Often times, if a case was opened regardless of EM 
determination services  are provided to the older  adult. For our purposes, PPV is a measure of VOICES ability to 
correctly classify  cases of clinically significant EM (true positive rate). Determination by [CONTACT_79673]-
standard criterion for comparison. Ideally, VOICES would only refer cases which would require an investigation 
and have a positive finding of EM as this would represent true validity in identifying positive cases.
VOICES-C Study: (01/10/2020 to 03/01/2020) completed 
We will conduct this activity to formally evaluate the usability of the VOICES tool.  Usability refers to how 
easily a specific task can be accomplished with a specific tool. The International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) defined usability as the "extent to which a product can be used by [CONTACT_79674], efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use" (ISO, 1998).  
Hypothesis 1a: users will report a high level of ease of use of VOICES. Hypothesis 1b: Users will report a high

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/16/2020Page 15 of 30           VOICES-Feasibility Study:
Eligibility and Capacity Evaluation :  We will use standardized criteria as described below to determine if the 
potential participant is capable of providing consent. The RAs will be highly trained in obtaining informed consent. 
They will receive training by [CONTACT_79680]. 
Evaluating the capacity of the participants to understand the purpose, risks, benefits, confidentiality, and privacy 
associated with study is vital for valid informed consent. The RAs will determine if the subject can participate 
based on their degree of alertness and if they are oriented to person, place and time and if they are able to 
communicate in English. 
If the patient meets the initial screening eligibility, and none of the exclusion criteria as described above, the RA 
will approach the patient and check if they are well enough to participate in the study. The RA will then check if 
the patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Then, the RA will use Abbreviated Mental Test 4 
(AMT-4) to assess cognitive status. If the patient scores < 4 on the AMT-4 then s/he will not be eligible to be 
enrolled in the study.  If the patient scores 4 on the AMT-4, then the RA will introduce the study and ask if s/he is 
interested in participating in the study. Factors to be considered include the ability to articulate a choice regarding 
study participation, understand its purpose, and comprehend that participation does not constitute medical 
treatment. If the patient is deemed capable and chooses to participate in the study, then the RA will perform the 
informed consent process to find out if the individual is still interested in participating in the study.  The timing of 
the informed consent will take place as described below:
1. The RA goes to the older adult’s room, if the caregiver is there, S/he will be asked to wait in the ED 
waiting room.
2. Escort the caregiver (if any) to wait in the waiting area  
3. Introduce  the study to the older adult when s/he is alone
4. If  the older adult agrees to participate, conduct the bedside screening that includes these questions: Is the 
patient well enough to participate? Is the patient able to hear the instructions from the iPad through the 
headphone provided?  Is the patient able to see instructions and demonstrations on the iPad screen?  Is the 
patient alert and oriented to person, place, and time?  Does the patient have a AMT-4 score of 
4)?                                         
5. If  all of the above was completed and the older adult is eligible and agrees to participate, start the informed 
consent process that will include all the eight basic elements of informed consent mentioned above and the 
additional elements of informed consent.
Connecticut law requires reporting of the abuse of persons above the age of 60. During the consent process, 
participants will be notified of this legal requirement but reassured that investigators will make every effort to 
make the process confidential and comfortable for the participant, including a) keepi[INVESTIGATOR_79633]'s reporting 
confidential and b) involving the care team (clinician, nurses, and attendings), who can address patient's concerns 
around reporting,  immediate safety concerns, and any concerns for retaliation or abandonment.
At the end of the consent process, the RA will review the subject’s understanding of the study by [CONTACT_79681]:
What  are you being asked to do?
What  questions is this study trying to answer?
What  are the potential risks and benefits of participating in this study?
Can  you withdraw from the study, and what should you do if you decide to withdraw?
Do  you understand that participation in this study is voluntary and is not part of your medical treatment?
10.Risks:  Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, discomforts, or 
inconveniences associate with subjects participating in the  research.
There are no medical interventions in this study, the direct medical risks are minimal. However, identification of 
potential EM without adequate safeguards could increase the risk of physical harm, emotional harm, risk of 
neglect, and financial loss to the victim. In addition, EM Identification can potentially lead to adverse events 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/16/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/16/2020Page 16 of 30including:
retaliation  of a family member, 
an  older adult may lose the caregiver or be abandoned by a caregiver, a family member or paid caregiver 
may be arrested / incarcerated. 
discharge  of a patient to a long-term care or skilled nursing facility, which they may not be able to afford 
and the setting of which could be problematic for them,
distress/anxiety  during and/or after using the VOICES tool is a potential risk given the complex emotions 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_79634],
participant  may suffer from distress and/or anxiety when reviewing information and answer questions 
about EM during the study session,
participant  may suffer from distress and/or anxiety when he or she realizes that he she is a victim of EM 
based on the information received from VOICES,
because  participants will review the VOICES tool and answer questions on the iPad with the help of the 
RA, there is a risk of compromised security of personal information,
Many of these adverse events would likely occur as a result of the mandatory report to PSE that the ED would 
make. However, during this study the ED is expected to discover information that will require the ED to make a 
report to PSE even if the patient does not want them to do so (and, as noted above, this report may have significant 
consequences). 
11. Minimizing  Risks: Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.
The Yale ED has a comprehensive, protocolized, and multi-disciplinary process for dealing with EM 
identification and disclosure and the appropriate next steps and interventions after EM disclosure or identification 
according to laws, local regulations, and statutory mandates, both on a federal- and state-level. After the start of 
the study and in the Yale ED, there will be two groups of EM victims:  A) those who were identified by [CONTACT_79682] B) those who were identified by [CONTACT_79683]. The two groups may have similar risks 
for adverse events, but they are different in one important way. For patients with EM identified by [CONTACT_79684], the 
risk is created because of the research intervention and wouldn’t occur if VOICES didn’t exist or if they declined 
to participate. Our research team is aware of the potential for the occurrence of adverse events that may be the 
result of the VOICES screening process. The subsequent ED multi-disciplinary response to EM identification, 
whether initially identified through VOICES or through ED usual care, is comprehensive and protocolized.
Risks will be minimized through appropriate participant exclusions and close medical supervision throughout the 
protocol.  We will inform all participants that there is a chance that they may experience AE or SAE by 
[CONTACT_79685]. We will also remind participants that they can 
discontinue participation at any time. In the Yale ED and when a member of the health care team has any 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_79635], he or she will notify the ED social worker who has a well-established multi-disciplinary and 
comprehensive protocol on how to handle the EM cases. The protocol includes any combination of the following:  
interview, screening (if EM is suspected but not yet identified), referral to community service provider, safety 
admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or reporting to CT Protective Services for the Elderly (PSE). The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the 
community, PSE, and the law enforcement agencies have systems in place to maintain the abuse victim’s safety. 
In Summary: VOICES’ goal is to help identify cases of EM within the ED visit. The subsequent procedures for 
the EM identification are important but are similar to the case when a provider identify suspi[INVESTIGATOR_79636]: 
•the  ED already (before conducting the VOICES study) has a comprehensive and protocolized multi-
disciplinary approach to respond when elder mistreatment is suspected by [CONTACT_79686].
•all patients who screen positive with the VOICES tool will receive a similar response.
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/16/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/16/2020Page 17 of 30•while  the research team recognizes that the EM identified through the VOICES tool may lead to adverse events 
for patients associated with EM identification, we anticipate that the Yale ED’s response will minimize the 
possible adverse events due to the EM identification.
We will train all RAs to detect common signs of distress and anxiety. If any are even suspected of being observed, 
our Co-I ([CONTACT_21144]), who is a licensed clinical psychologist, will be contact[CONTACT_79687], which could include counseling, referrals or a psychiatric evaluation
Moreover, a licensed clinical psychologist will be available for consultation to the staff and patient, if needed, 
during most hours of recruitment. When this level of back-up is not available, we will have psychiatry back-up for 
any distressed reactions that require mental status evaluation. Thus, some psychological or psychiatric evaluation 
will be available during all study assessments and during all recruitment periods of the project to facilitate 
stabilization and necessary referrals for participants who report distress during assessment procedures.
If the older adult screens positive on the VOICES for EM or the older adult wants to self-disclose EM, the RA 
will notify the care team in the ED that there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_79635]. Also, if the tool fails to identify EM but the 
patient would like to disclose EM, the RA will notify the care team. The RA will stay with the participant until a 
member of the care team arrives and implements existing protocols for handling EM in the ED. 
The care team can address each patient's concerns around reporting, immediate safety concerns, and any concerns 
for retaliation or abandonment. The care team will contact [CONTACT_79688]/her cell phone. The social worker will perform the Social Worker Assessment. If the assessment indicates 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_79637], then the social worker will work with members of the multi-disciplinary team to handle the 
mistreatment case. If the case gets reported to PSE, usually PSE will arrive at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79638] 12 hours to take 
care of the case. While waiting for PSE, the health care team members will discuss safety issues with the patient. 
If the older adult feels s/he is in immediate danger or does not feel safe going home, the care team will create a 
safe disposition plan that can include safety admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79639] a more permanent 
solution.
We will protect against psychological distress by [CONTACT_79689] a chance that they may 
experience some negative emotions while completing the surveys, after completing survey, or when they leave the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], but that they do not have to answer questions that they find distressing. We will also remind participants 
that they can discontinue participation at any time. We will also provide all older adults that we approach with the 
brochure on resources for aging well that also include free referral line. These options will be discussed with 
participants during initial recruitment.  
Although privacy and confidentiality will be preserved to the utmost extent possible, participants will be informed 
that, should EM be identified, the RA will report this to the care team in the ED. For example, if in the course of 
research procedures, a participant reveals elder abuse to the RA, the RA will discuss with the participant his/her 
responsibility to report the abuse to the care team in the ED. The care team will do its EM assessment and if they 
find suspi[INVESTIGATOR_79637], they will intervene to ensure that ED’s EM protocol is implemented.  Also, if the 
participant divulges suicidality, the RA must report this to the care team in the ED and notify the PI.
We will follow standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79640], loss of 
confidentiality,
 psychological distress, and escalation of abuse, acknowledging that awareness or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_79641], make them safer. 
Our intent is to conduct a VOICES study session without the presence of the caregiver. From our experience, 
family members usually volunteer to leave the room once the health care provider walks in. When they are asked 
to leave the room, they usually do so. We will ask the caregivers to leave the room before engaging the older 
adults in the study and before consenting them. If the older adult wants the caregiver to remain, we will respect 
their wishes, but that patient will be excluded from the study and no study information will be presented. 
Given the sensitive nature of the study topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], along with the safety concerns surrounding elder abuse, RAs will 
discuss the risk should study materials (e.g., copi[INVESTIGATOR_79642]) be seen by [CONTACT_79690] 7/16/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/16/2020Page [ADDRESS_86936].  If a participant reveals severe depression or suicidality, or requests immediate 
psychiatric care for any reason, the RA will alert the patient’s clinician to initiate an immediate psychiatric 
evaluation. 
The RAs will receive training for all procedures related to suicidality and elder abuse.
Since the VOICES tool is a web-based application in nature, no information will be stored on the tablet. If the 
tablet gets lost or stolen, the patient’s data will not be compromised. All iPads contain encryption software, per 
University Policy 5100.  
12.Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plan: Include  an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) based 
on the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final determination of the 
risk to subjects.)
The DSMP will be monitored by [CONTACT_3476]. The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring 
participants’ safety on a daily basis. To ensure that we are  identifying both the adverse events that we might 
anticipate as well as those that you might not, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_79643]: (1) a report was made to 
PSE or (2) a patient was admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79644]. The Data 
and Safety Monitoring Team (DSMT) will consist of Drs. Fuad Abujarad, Thomas Gill, James Dziura, Karen 
Jubanyik, and Esther Choo; this team will monitor participant safety, evaluate the progress of the study, and 
review procedures for maintaining the confidentiality of data, the quality of data collection, management, and 
analyses. They will monitor the study for reports of any adverse or unexpected events. Study participants will be 
advised to contact [CONTACT_79691]. VOICES will only be administrated 
for the intervention group, and there will be no control groups. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_79645]. The following will be reviewed:
Cumulative accrual

12.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-
threatening experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, or any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition
Adverse Event (AE): An undesirable and unintended, although not necessarily unexpected, as direct result of 
using the VOICES tool. 
Reportable Adverse Event 
An adverse event that must be reported to the IRB and the NIA Program Officer because it is all of the 
following: 
1. Serious or life-threatening; AND 
2. Unanticipated (unexpected) OR anticipated but occurring with a greater frequency than expected; AND 
3. Possibly, probably or definitely related to the intervention.
This section describes the procedures and timelines for adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE), 
collection and reporting.
• No  SAEs are expected from the direct use of VOICES tool on the iPad, but when SAEs occur as result of 
EM identification and disclosure that are related to the VOICES tool, they will be reported to the NIA Program 
Officer, Yale IRB, and to the research team within 48 hours of study’s knowledge of the SAE. 
• AEs  will be reported per YALE IRB policies. They will also be reported to the NIA Program Officer and 
the study’s team at frequency requested by [CONTACT_45455]. At minimum, semi-annual reports.
• In the unlikely event that such events occur, Reportable Events (which are events that are serious or life-
threatening and unanticipated and possibly related) or Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or 
Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) that may require a temporary or permanent interruption of study activities will be reported 
immediately to the NIA Program Officer, Yale IRB, and to the research team, followed by a written report within 
5 calendar days of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_79646]. 
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_79647]. 
• All  deaths will be reported within 24 hours of study’s knowledge of death. 
• The report of death will be submitted to NIA Program Officer, Yale IRB, and to the research team.
• Since  the VOICES tool is a web-based application in nature, no information will be stored on the tablet. 
Data will be stored on Yale secure servers. If the tablet becomes lost or stolen, the patient’s data will not be 
compromised. All iPads contain encryption software, per University Policy 5100.

12.3 Data Analysis and Coordination
Data analysis will be conducted with the help of the Yale Center for Analytic Sciences (YCAS) and will be 
performed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Analysis of feasibility will be primarily descriptive. 
Numeric summaries including frequencies for categorical outcomes and means, medians, standard deviations and 
interquartile ranges for continuous feasibility outcomes will be presented. Graphical summaries will be used to 
describe distributions of outcomes and relations of outcomes with baseline characteristics. 95% confidence 
intervals for means and proportions will be estimated to describe uncertainty from sampling variation for 
feasibility outcomes.
The research team seeks to broadly disseminate the study results through publication in peer-reviewed journals 
and presentations at national meetings to share and demonstrate the findings and the lessons learned from this 
project. We plan to present at conferences such as the Gerontological Society of America annual meeting, the 
American Geriatrics Society annual meeting, and the National Association of Adult Protective Services annual 
meeting. 
In accordance with  the National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy to promote broad and responsible 
dissemination of information from NIH-funded clinical trials, we are registered VOICES trial on 
ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). In addition, we will submit the 
VOICES trial results information to ClinicalTrials.gov.  
The informed consent documents for the VOICES trial will include a specific statement that states the posting of 
clinical trial information at ClinicalTrials.gov and the trial number.
13.Statistical  Considerations: Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design.
VOICES-C and D:
Data collection instruments for usability are tools that help us analyze the design, implementation, and 
integration process. Usability data analysis will include percentage of successfully completed tasks; 
number and types of errors; time to successfully perform a particular task; user satisfaction ratings; and 
verbal and written feedback from the sessions. Quantitative data will be analyzed as numerical indicators 
and summarized using common descriptive statistics appropriate for discrete and continuous data. Non-
numerical indicators will be analyzed using qualitative methods. Key results will be used to 1. Modify the 
VOICES tool to make it more usable and acceptable in terms of system's design; and 2. Normalize 
VOICES by [CONTACT_79693]. We will conduct data analysis by [CONTACT_79694] 
2®, a package that allows simultaneous video recording, user screen capture, note-taking, and participant 
survey. Key usability measures will include both qualitative and quantitative outcome measures. These 
include effectiveness (i.e., how well a system does what it is supposed to do), efficiency (i.e., the way a 
system supports users), and satisfaction (i.e., subjective responses from users about the system). 
VOICES Feasibility Study:
Sample size calculations were performed using PASS v2012. The objective of this study is to evaluate 
markers of feasibility rather than to determine the efficacy of VOICES. The sample size was therefore 
determined based on the practical considerations of time and availability of subjects as well as the 
precision by [CONTACT_79695]. We estimate EM prevalence to range from 
7% to 12% among adults age 60 and above since the reported numbers in literature were for ages 65 and 
above. In addition, if we also assume that 20% of them may not participate in the study based on 
cognitive ability, then we can expect the EM prevalence in our eligible sample to range from 6% to 9.6%.

SECTION III: RECRUITMENT/ CONSENT AND ASSENT PROCEDURESIf we also exclude subjects with clear signs of EM (1 in 24) 5%, as they will be immediately identified 
and reported by [CONTACT_22367], then we are left with EM prevalence estimation of 5.7% - 9.12%. A 
sample size of eight hundred subjects (N=800) should thus result in 45-72 adults from whom we can 
estimate the proportions who change their self-identification response and who are ready to self-disclose 
after using VOICES. This will be a sufficient size to estimate a 95% confidence interval around a 
proportion with a width of no greater than 0.3. A sample size of 800 will provide a precision of +/- 0.[ADDRESS_86938] deviations for the 95% confidence interval around a mean for continuous feasibility outcomes 
(e.g. acceptability, time to completion). This sample size will also produce precision of no worse than +/- 
14% in the estimation of a 95% confidence interval around a proportion for dichotomous feasibility 
outcomes (e.g. demand, implementation).

3.Recruitment  Procedures:
a.Describe  how potential subjects will be  identified.
  Subjects for the focus group will be identified as English speaking and age 60+.
The first focus group will have four older adult participants, two caregivers, two ED providers, and two ED 
social workers. The second and third focus groups will have 6-8 older adult participants in each.
Participants will be recruited from the community and YNHH, by [CONTACT_79696]-Central Connecticut.
VOICES-C: 12 subjects will be recruited to participate in this usability study.  We seek a purposive sample 
of adult male and female age > 60 years.  We will recruit participants primarily from the New Haven area, 
inviting them to participate in the usability evaluation of the VOICES tool; participation in this study will be 
completely voluntary. Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_86939] per session as a thank you for their time.
VOICES-D: The supplemental disabilities study will be used to evaluate the accessibility of VOICES tool by 
[CONTACT_79697]. We plan to recruit 24 older adults (up to [ADDRESS_86940] of hearing).
We will recruit participants primarily from the mid-Michigan area, inviting them to participate in the 
usability evaluation of the VOICES tool; participation in this study will be completely voluntary. Participants 
will receive a $[ADDRESS_86941] per session as a thank you for their time and to reduce the likelihood of 
“no-shows.”
For VOICES Feasibility Study: In the ED setting, we will seek to enroll eligible older adults (N=800). 
Working with the ED, we will develop a rotating schedule for the Study Coordinator/Research Assistant that 
varies shifts and days to get a more representative ED sample. The Study Coordinator/Research Assistant 
will be stationed in the ED and will work with designated nurses and social workers to identify potential 
participants.
b.Describe  how potential subjects are contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].

4.Assessment  of Current Health Provider Relationship for HIPAA Consideration:
Does the Investigator or any member of the research team have a direct existing clinical relationship with any 
potential subject?
☐Yes,  all  subjects
☐Yes,  some of the subjects
☒No
If yes, describe the nature of this relationship. 
5.Request  for waiver of HIPAA  authorization: (When requesting  a waiver of HIPAA Authorization for either 
the entire study, or for recruitment purposes only. Note: if you are collecting PHI as part of a phone or email 
screen, you must request a HIPAA waiver for recruitment purposes.)
Choose one:
☐For  entire study
☒  For recruitment/screening purposes only
☐For  inclusion of non-English speaking subject if short form is being used and there is no translated HIPAA 
research authorization form available on the University’s HIPAA website at hipaa.yale.edu.
i.Describe  why it would be impracticable to obtain the subject’s authorization for use/disclosure  of this 
data: 
We are requesting a HIPPA waiver for recruitment purposes only. The RA will review the ED Track 
Board in EPIC and will then check the demographic and chief complaint for patient 60 years or 
older. They will then approach the patients identified as EMR screening eligible to ask additional 
screening questions. We don’t have resources and staffing to approach every ED patient and 
ascertain eligibility. Using Epic is more efficient for the RAs.
The RA will track and document each HER that the RA access using the HIPAA Disclosure 
Tracking Spreadsheet found at https://hipaa.yale.edu/policies-procedures-form .

Several translated short form templates are available on the HRPP website (yale.edu/hrpp) and translated HIPAA 
Research Authorization Forms are available on the HIPAA website (hipaa.yale.edu). If the translation of the short 
form is not available on our website, then the translated short form needs to be submitted to the IRB office for 
approval via modification prior to enrolling the subject. Please review the guidance and presentation on use of 
the short form available on the HRPP website.
If using a short form without a translated HIPAA Research Authorization Form, please request a HIPAA 
waiver in the section above.7.Evaluation  of Subject(s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent: Indicate how the personnel 
obtaining consent will assess the potential subject’s ability and capacity to consent to the research being 
proposed.
The Study Coordinator/Research Assistant will determine if the subject can participate based on if they are 
alert and oriented to person, place and time and if they are able to communicate in English. In addition, we 
will design a detailed process on how to evaluate capacity, determine competence, and obtain informed 
consent from older adults (please see the DSMP). Evaluating the capacity of the participants to understand the 
purpose, risks, benefits, confidentiality, and privacy associated with study is vital for valid informed consent. 
We will use standardized criteria to determine if the potential participant is capable of providing consent. 
Members of the study team who are responsible for participant recruitment and consent will be highly trained 
in obtaining informed consent and with using the iPad that the consent will be conducted on. They will 
receive training by [CONTACT_79661]. 
Ability to provide informed consent will be assessed using the Abbreviated Mental Test 4 (AMT-4) to assess 
cognitive status designed to assess decision-making capacity for research participation according to NIH 
standards. Additionally, we will employ  evidence-based practices from the fields of IPV and geriatrics to 
correctly address these challenges.

Confidentiality & Security of Data:
This is  a single center study. All data will be entered into databases that are protected with appropriate 
passwords and routine backups of all data will be carried out. All data collected on the subjects will be coded 
with numbers to maintain confidentiality. Access to the files will be restricted to the investigators and study 
personnel on this protocol. It is possible that the Human Investigation Committee, YCCI, or the NIH, may 
review study results during auditing procedures but these individuals are required to keep all information 
confidential.
Clinical data  will be stored with specific patient identifiers, (de-identification of samples), and maintained in a 
locked file, separate from any other clinical records with limited access, to assure patient confidentiality. Results 
will be assembled with confidential clinical research records, but will be unidentifiable without these files, to 
assure confidentiality. The only data that will be used in this study is the information directly obtained from the 
subjects.

2.How  will the research  data be collected,  recorded  and stored? We will have  shadow files on each subject.  Data 
of the study will be entered into a secure database. In this study, the following materials will be collected from 
human subjects: questionnaire, study subject’s study ID, and signature.  All paper  documents  will be maintained 
in a locked file, separate from other  clinical records to assure confidentiality. All electronically stored data will 
be encrypted and password-protected. Only the primary investigator, co-investigators, study coordinator and 
programmers will have access to subjects’ data. All datasets will be de-identified and only known to study 
investigators involved  in consent and data acquisition. All information relating to participating  subjects will be 
deidentified.

4.What  methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality and security  of the identifiable study 
data and the storage media indicated above during and after the subject’s participation in the study?
The VOICES system will be designed to ensure compliance with good research practice regarding the 
management of research data containing Protected Health Information (PHI). VOICES will adopt 
comprehensive security strategies that will assure the confidentiality and privacy of the patient and clinical 
information. Only authorized users will have access to patient PHI, which will help assuage concerns 
participants may have regarding the privacy and security of their data. The guidelines contained in the 
Common Framework give a detailed specification of technical architecture, privacy safeguards, and several 
approaches to health information exchange. We will utilize this framework to protect patient privacy and keep 
PHI under strict local control. We will continuously evaluate our security  practices  in order to quickly identify 
any new vulnerabilities that could compromise VOICES integrity and privacy. We will utilize the Yale 
Information Technology Services (ITS) existing privacy and security practices and technology, and 
incorporate Yale ITS-consistent policies into VOICES development and implementation. In addition to tier 
separation and firewall protection, the three-tiered architecture maintains VOICES security, confidentiality, 
and privacy. VOICES will maintain data security with appropriate encryption, system controls and audit 
trails. Paper surveys will be stored in a locked area. All electronic data will be de-identified and stored in 
secure database.
5.What  will be done with the data when the research is completed? Are there plans to destroy the identifiable 
data? If yes, describe  how, by [CONTACT_22467]. If no, describe  how the data and/or 
identifiers will be secured.
Data will be stored in safe secure server.
6.If  appropriate, has a Certificate of Confidentiality been obtained? YES

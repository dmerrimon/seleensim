 3 BACKGROUND & SIGNIFICANCE :  
Among the most frequently used methods of contraception are daily -dosing regimens such as  oral 
contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], or coital -dependant methods such as condoms .[ADDRESS_1154755] high typi[INVESTIGATOR_831975]  (> 8%)2 contributing to the unintended pregnancy rates in the [LOCATION_002] that approach 50% 
each year.  Unintended pregnancy has serious economic and social consequences for both individuals and 
society as a whole .3,4 Emergency contraception  (EC) has been shown to be effective in preventing pregnancy 
when used within [ADDRESS_1154756] common regimen used today is a progestin -only 
(levonorgestrel) oral regimen which has been shown to reduce pregnancy risk by 60-94%.8-14 The copper T -380 
intrauterine device (IUD) has been shown to have even greater efficacy reducing the risk of pregnancy by 
99% .15-[ADDRESS_1154757] or associated side-effects .  
A recent observational feasibility study provided promising results ; when offered a choice of the oral 
levonorgestrel (LNG) regimen or copper T -[ADDRESS_1154758]  unintended pregnancy rates .  
There is a second, more popular intrauterine contraceptive method available in the U.S, the levonorgestrel 
intrauterine system (LNG -IUS), which has not yet been evaluated as an emergency contraceptive method. The 
LNG -IUS is more appealing to women as it offers many noncontraceptive benefits with many users reporting 
lighter and less painful menses . 19-[ADDRESS_1154759] -coital (EC) setting. Potential mechanisms include both pre - 
and post -fertilization effects. Pre -fertilization effects include disruption of sperm motility and viability,  
alteration in the speed of ovum transport, and direct damage to the ovum.[ADDRESS_1154760] to show that the LNG -IUS can be used as an effective method of emergency contraception and has 
higher efficacy rates than oral EC.  Confirming effectiveness of the LNG -IUS in this setting will expand access 
and uptake. Increasing the use of intrauterine contraception as a method of emergency con traception and 
providing long -term reversible contraception, has the potential to significantly reduce unintended pregnancy 
and abortion rates.  In 2009 , the Institute of Medicine declared expanding access to long -acting reversible 
The LIFE Study   PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_831974]  
 
   
 4 contraceptive  (LARC)  meth ods one of the top priorities of comparative effectiveness research29, and this study 
will help reach that goal.  
INNOVATION :  
There are currently no data addressing the use or effectiveness of the LNG -IUS as a method of emergency 
contraception. This proposal will provide essential information to both patients and clinicians in this field. 
Specifically, the LIFE study (levonorgestrel IUS F or Emergency contraception)  will answer the following 
questions:  
1) Is the LNG -IUS an effective method of emergency contraception?  
2) Is the LNG -IUS more effective than the oral levonorgestrel regimen?  
3) Are women receiving LNG -IUS more likely to be using a LARC m ethod at 6  months?  
4) Are women receiving the LNG -IUS as emergency contraception still using  and satisfied with  their 
method at 6 months  and at 12 months?  
Current  practices in the [LOCATION_002] provide women 4 choices of EC. A modified regimen of com bined ora l 
contraceptives (Yuzpe method) has been shown to be the least effective and associated with the most side -
effects .[ADDRESS_1154761] consequence of low use of long acting reversible contraceptiv es.32 
APPROACH  
General: The  purpose of this proposal is to recruit  [ADDRESS_1154762] use of a contraceptive method or no method use  at all , who do 
not desire pregnancy at this time.  
 
Participants will be r andomized to ulipristal acetate  (the most effective oral EC available)  or to the study 
therapy, levonorgestrel intrauterine system  (LNG -IUS). The primary outcome of this study is pregnancy 
occurring despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391]. We will address the following specific  aims:  
 
Primary Aim : Our primary aim  is to evaluate the effectiveness of the LNG-IUS as a method of emergency 
contraception  (EC) by [CONTACT_831983]  (UPA ) and 
LNG -IUS. The objective  of this aim is to provide evidence that will expand access to this highly effective 
The LIFE Study   PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_831974]  
 
   
 5 method of long term contraception. We will perform a randomized controlled trial comparing pregnancy rates 
in women receiving the  LNG-IUS to those receiving  the oral EC.  
Hypothesis: The LNG -IUS will be more effective than  the oral UPA as a method of EC and through [ADDRESS_1154763] will reduce barriers to intrauterine contraception , thereby [CONTACT_831984], and subsequently impacting unintended preg nancy and abortion rates.  
 
Secondary Aim  1: Our secondary aim is to evaluate long -acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) use at [ADDRESS_1154764] effective methods of contraception.  
Hypothesis : When compared to women who receive the oral UPA , women who receive intrauterine 
contra ception as a form of EC have higher rates of LARC use  at 6 and 12  months .  
 
It is our expectation  that the anticipated  difference in LARC use at 6 and 12 months between the two groups 
will provide supportive evidence for the importance of reducing barriers to intrauterine contraception by 
[CONTACT_831985] a method of EC.  
 
Secondary Aim 2 : One secondary aim of this project is to quantify the contraceptive continuation and 
satisfaction rates of the participants randomized to LNG-IUS.  The objective of this aim is to demonstrate that 
if women have access to the LNG -IUS in this time period, m ost will continue use for at least [ADDRESS_1154765] high levels of satisfaction .  Hypothesis : Greater than 70% of w omen receiving the LNG -IUS as EC will have 
continu ed use and satisfaction.  
It is our expectation  that the information gained from com pletion of this aim will contribute to the growing 
body of literature describing continuation and satisfaction rates among different groups of LARC users.  
Research Design and Methodology : 
Research design and general metho dological approach : We will perfor m a randomized control trial  comparing 
oral UPA  to LNG -IUS for emergency contraception . We will prospectively enroll [ADDRESS_1154766] of under -protected intercourse within the previous 5 day s (120  hours) . Participants with a negative 
pregnancy test, and who meet all inclusion criteria, will be randomized to either an immediate LNG -IUS 
insertion or oral UPA EC regimen  (30mg ulipristal acetate)  in a 3:[ADDRESS_1154767] enrollment  to complete a follow -
up survey. The primary outcome of this study is observed pregnancy rates  at 5 weeks and 6 months after 
enrollment .  
 
Criteria for selection of subjects : Potential participants for this study wi ll be identified in as follows : 1) Women 
enrolled in the Contraceptive CHOICE Project  (CHOICE) who are not currently using a  long acting reversible 
contraceptive  (LARC ) method and have experienced an act of under -protected intercourse in the previous 5 
The LIFE Study   PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_831974]  
 
   
 6 days ; 2) Women presenting, either in person or via telephone contact, to the Barnes Jewish Hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_421182]’s 
Health resident OB/GYN clinic who have experienced an act of under -protected intercourse in the previous 5 
days ; 3) Women identified from an adverti sing campaign ; and  
Enrollment : All potential participants receive informed consent and will be directed to make an appointment 
for consent, randomization, and allocation of method.   
Inclusion Criteria :  
 Women age 1 4-45 
 Under -protected intercourse within the last five days  (120 hours)  
 Willingness to accept either IUS intervention  or oral EC  
 Ability and willingness to follow -up via telephone for results of a urine pregnancy test (UPT)  
 Ability and willingness to be contact[CONTACT_479451] 6 and 12  month follow-up  
Exclusion Criteria : 
 Positive pregnancy test  
 Non-English speak ing 
 Contrain dication to intrauterine contraception  or oral UPA  
o Active cervicitis , PID, or recent post -abortal or postpartum infection  
o Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding  
o Known or suspected c ervical or endometrial neoplasia  
o Known or suspected breast cancer or other progestin -sensitive cancer  
o Uterine anomalies that preclude IUD insertion  
 Inability or unwillingness to comply with follow -up 
Randomization : A permuted block randomization  scheme will be created using  the nQuery  software 
(Statistical Solutions, Saugus, MA)  using a computerized random number generator .  Block sizes will vary, and 
will be balanced within each recruitment  site.  Assignment will be concealed in sealed, opaque e nvelopes.    
Participants will be randomly assigned to LNG -IUS or oral UPA with a 3:1 ratio.  
Description of drugs and devices : 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the LNG -IUS in 2000 as a 5 -year method of reversible 
contraception. The devic e contains  52 mg of levonorgestrel which is slowly released at a rate of 20  mcg/day 
into the uterus . The device is safe, effective and easy to use in almost all populations. The standard 
contraceptive mechanism of action is through cervical mucus thickening and endometrial lining suppression .[ADDRESS_1154768] approved oral levonorgestrel with a dedicated indication for emergency contraception in 1998. 
There are currently two acceptable dosing protocols, single -dose, an d two -dose, both of which contain a total 
of 1.5  mg of levonorgestrel.  There are several proposed mechanisms by [CONTACT_831986] : inhibited or delayed ovulation ,34-36 interferenc e with sperm transport and penetration ,37 and 
The LIFE Study   PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_831974]  
 
   
 [ADDRESS_1154769] 2011 (ulipristal acetate) is a synthetic progesterone 
agonist/antagonist. When taken immediately before ovulation is to occur, Ella postpones follicular rupture. 
The likely primary mechanism of action of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is therefore 
inhibition or delay of ovulation; however, alterations to the endometrium that may affect implantation may 
also contribute to efficacy.  
Ulipristal acetate (UPA)  is specifically indicated as an emergency contraceptive for prevention of pregnancy 
following unprotected intercourse or a known or suspected contraceptive failure.   UPA is supplied as a tablet 
for oral administration.  The recommended dose is one 30 mg tablet taken orally as soon as possible, within 
120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse or a known or suspected contraceptive failure.  
Complete descriptions of both LNG -IUS (Mirena) and UPA (Ella) are provided in  the Package Inserts.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_831976]. 
 
Evaluation/ Follow -Up: 
At enrollment all women will undergo a highly sensitive urine pregnancy test as well as self -collected vaginal 
swab for sexually transmitted diseas e (STI) testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae  and Chlamydia trachomatis . 
Randomization and allocation of emergency contraceptive method will occur immediately following consent. 
A positive test for an STI will not exclude the patient from participation.  All positive N. gonorrhoeae  or C. 
trachomatis  tests will be treated with standard CDC-approved treatment. Partner treatment will also be 
offered. Women randomly assigned to the LNG -IUS group will be asked to return at [ADDRESS_1154770] 
enrollment to obtain results.  Participants will then be contact[CONTACT_66179] a follow -up survey s at 6 and 12 
months following enrollment.  
Measures : Urine pregnancy test results will be documented at [ADDRESS_1154771].  Participants were able and willing to report home pregnancy testing results 
and/or return for  a visit for a sensitive pregnancy test.  Any woman who suspects pregnancy, is late for her 
routine menstrual cycle, or who reports a positive home test will be asked to return to our clinic for pregnancy 
test validation and options counseling (offered opt ion of continuing the pregnancy or pregnancy termination).  
We are using the CONSULT urine pregnancy test which is sensitive to a hcg level of 20mIU/mL with a specificity 
of >99% (Appendix A).   
 
Women enrolled in an EC study are clearly motivated to avoid an unintended pregnancy.  A negative home 
pregnancy test and regular menses reliably excludes an on -going pregnancy.  Self -report of a negative test and 
menses will not be validated, as they are acceptable measures to reliably exclude pregnancy.  Pregnancy

 [ADDRESS_1154772], with two peer -reviewed publications accepted 
to the New England Journal of Medicine (Winner B. et al. 2012 & Secura G. et al. 2014)  
 
At the follow -up phone survey s, individual level information will be updated with new medical data  including 
any new medical diagnosis, interval pregnancies since enrollment, and interval diagnosis of STIs. We will also 
assess fertility desires, recent and current contraceptive use, and recurrent emergency contraception 
utilization.  
Primary Outcome : The primary outcome  of this study is unintended pregnancy  following emergency 
contraception  at both [ADDRESS_1154773] -enrollment.  
Secondary Outcomes : 1. Long acting reversible contraception (LARC) use at 6 and 12 months following method 
allocation will be evaluated.  2. Continuation and satisfaction among participants in the LNG -IUS arm.  
Potential Confoun ders : There are a number of variables that make act as potential confounders. These 
variables will be tested for their association with the primary outcome  and treatment assignment . Age is 
strongly associated with fertility. Other potential confounders inc lude: race/ethnic ity, socioeconomic status 
(measured  by [CONTACT_831987]),  history of sexually transmitted infection or pelvic inflammatory 
disease , previous or current contraceptive method . Given random assignment, we expect two arms will be 
balanced in terms of known and unknown confounding variables.  However, if any imbalance is noted, w e will 
control for possible confounders in our multivariable statistical analysis.    
Data Management:  Study staff located within the Division of Clinical Re search will be responsible for data 
collection, entry, and management. Off-site staff will enroll participants remotely using the RedCap secure 
website.  All telephone follow up surveys will be conducted by [CONTACT_831988]. 
Louis , School of Medicine.    Data from telephone interviews will be entered using a secure web portal and 
stored on secure Washington University in St Louis Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology servers. All 
parti cipants will be assigned a study identificatio n number. This study I.D. will be used on all data forms and 
for all computer entries. Data entry will be completed using  a custom software package (Illume  ™; DatStat Inc., 
Seattle, WA). The data manager will be responsible for data processing, validity ch ecks, and communication 
with the team on data issues.  
Statistical Approach  & Data Analysis : 
 Preliminary Analysis : Descriptive  analyses will include comparison of the baseline characteristics of 
participants in the two treatment arms. Continuous variable s will be summarized using mean s, median s, and 
standard deviation s. Categorical variables will be presented as frequencies. Continuous variables that are 
normally distributed will be analyze d with Students T -test, and for those that are not normally distrib uted 
nonparametric tests will be used. Chi -square and Fisher’s exact will be used to analyze ordinal variables.  
The LIFE Study   PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_831974]  
 
   
 9 Primary Aim:   Observed p regnanc ies in the LNG -IUS group will be compared to those in the oral group. 
Because our primary outcome, pregnancy rat e (yes/no) is a dichotomous variable, l ogistic regression will be 
used .  
Secondary Aim1 : One secondary aim is to evaluate long -acting reversible contraception (LARC) use at 6 and 
12months. We hypothesize that women randomized to the LNG -IUS group will be m ore likely to be using a 
LARC method.  This categorical variable (yes/no use) will be presented as frequency of LARC use in the two 
groups . Chi-square and logistic regression will be used for analysis . 
Secondary Aim2 : Continuation and satisfaction in LNG-IUS arm will be evaluated. Both continuation and 
satisfaction will be  assessed as dichotomous variables. Continuation and satisfaction (satisfied/ not satisfied) 
will be presented as frequencies and analyzed with Chi -square  and logistic regression .   
Power Analysis and Sample Size  
Power analysis and Sample size calculation was performed with Epi-Info v 6.0.  
Sample Size : With an alpha ( α) = 0.05, power of 90%, and assuming unintended pregnancy rates (total 5 weeks 
through 6 months) of 11% for the oral UPA regimen  and 2% for the LNG -IUS, and a 3:1 ratio of LNG -IUS allocation 
to UPA, we calculate our sample size to be 532 participants  (399 LNG -IUS and 133 UPA ). This accounts for 
approximately  20% loss to follow -up rate  by 6 months .  We chose a 3:1 ratio of LNG -IUS to UPA to allow for a 
more precise estimate of immediate failure rates of the LNG -IUS group.  
 
Data Analysis/ Statistical Methods : 
Preliminary Analysis : Descriptive analyses will include comparison of the baseline characteris tics of participants 
in the two treatment arms. Continuous variables will be summarized using means, medians, and standard 
deviations. Categorical variables will be presented as frequencies. Continuous variables that are normally 
distributed will be analyz ed with Students t -test, and nonparametric tests will be used for those that are not 
normally distributed. Chi -square and Fisher’s exact tests will be used to analyze categorical variables.  
 
Primary Aim :  Observed pregnancies at 5 -6 weeks and at 6 months in the LNG -IUD group will be compared to 
those in the oral UPA group. The analysis population is enrolled women who complete 5 -6-week and 6 month 
follow -up.  “Modified” intent to treat analysis will be used.  Pregnancies will be presented as frequencies an d 
chi-square tests will be used for analysis. We expect the two groups to be balanced on important confounding 
variables such as menstrual cycle day at the time of unprotected intercourse. However, if there are significant 
imbalances, stratified or multiva riable analysis will be performed. Pregnancies at [ADDRESS_1154774] menstrual period time.  
Logistic regression will be used to control for confounding (if necess ary) using the dichotomous outcome of 
pregnancy (yes/no) at each time point.  
 
Secondary Aim1 : Descriptive analyses will be used to compare demographic characteristics of participants who 
screen eligible, but decline to participate and those who enroll in t he study. Reasons for declining participation 
will also be collected and qualitatively evaluated for recurrent themes.

Secondary Aim2 : Long -acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) use (either an IUD or contraceptive implant) at [ADDRESS_1154775] on the interpretation of our results.   
Right to Withdraw or Removal from Study:  Particip ants are free to withdraw from this study at any time. The 
subject must inform the Investigator immediately if they intend to withdraw. To terminate the subject’s 
participation in this study, they must contact [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_831977]. They w ill be asked 
complete a brief end -of-study telephone interview .  Their decision to participate in this study or to withdraw from 
this study will not influence the availability of their future medical care and will involve no penalty or loss of  
benefits to which they are otherwise entitled.   
 
Study Principal Investigators, the FDA, or NEIRB (central IRB) can remove the subject from this study without their 
consent for any reason, including, but not limited to:  
a. Investigator judgment that any condition or cir cumstance may jeopardize their welfare or the integrity of 
the study.  
b. Participant fails to follow the instructions of the investigator(s).  
c. Side effects or complications experienced by [CONTACT_2299].  
d. If the study is stopped by [CONTACT_456], Data Safety and  Monitoring Board (DSMB), investigators, FDA, or 
NEIRB prior to completion.  
 
RISK MANAGEMENT : All other known risks will be disclosed to the subject via the informed consent process. 
Risks of either method of EC are outlined  in the package insert and this protocol.  There is also a risk of 
unintended pregnancy .  Patients with a positive pregnancy test will be provided with options counseling.  
ADVERSE REACTIONS : There are few s ide effects of UPA and LNG -IUS. These are listed i n the protocol and 
informed consent form.  Most side effects resolve spontaneously.  Anticipated events means reactions to 
treatment previously observed that may require medical intervention but are not serious in nature.   
All adverse events that occur  will be recorded in the Source Documents. Adverse events should be captured in 
the medical history.  
Adverse Events occurring will be captured and followed until the condition resolves, stabilizes, or is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. Subjects will be instructed that they may contact [CONTACT_831989] [INVESTIGATOR_831978].    
The Investigator will review each event and assess its relationship to method of EC  (not related, unlikely, 
possible, probable, and highly probable). The following definitions will be used for rating relationship to the 
treatments or investigational device:  
The LIFE Study   PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_831974]  
 
   
 11  Not related – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
 Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or a concomitant medication administered to the subject; and does not follow 
a known response pattern to the investigational device.  
 Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational device 
administration; and/or follows a known response pattern to the study treatments;  but could have been 
produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant 
medications administered to the subject.  
 Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigati onal device 
administration; and follows a known response pattern to the investigational device; and cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or 
concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
 Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational 
device administration; and follows a known response pattern to the investigational device; and cannot 
be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, 
or concomitant medications administered to the subject; and either occurs immediately following 
investigational device administration, or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_831979], or r eappears 
on repeat exposure, or there is a positive reaction at the treatment site.  
 
Each adverse event reported will be graded on a 3 -point severity scale.   The following definitions for rating 
severity will be used:  
 Mild – easily tolerated, causing minim al discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday activities.  
 Moderate – sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
 Severe – incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities.  
 
A Serious Adverse Event  is any ad verse device experience that results in any of the following outcomes:  death, 
a life -threatening adverse device experience, in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318], a 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital a nomaly/birth defect. Important medical events 
that may or may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious 
adverse device experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject 
or subject may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
 
If any of the above adverse events are serious as defined by [CONTACT_58317] (CFR), Title 21, 
special procedures w ill be followed.  All serious adverse events will be reported within [ADDRESS_1154776] completes the study and where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to 
document the resolution of event(s).  
The LIFE Study   PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_831974]  
 
   
 12 Outcomes may be classified as resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown (lost to follow -up).  
Followi ng the resolution of any study -associated adverse events there will be no further adverse event reports 
for that subject.  
PROTOCOL  DEVIATIONS :  No deviations from this protocol will be permitted, except in a medical emergency, 
without the approval of the Coordinating Center/Sponsor.  Any amendment to this study will be discussed by 
[CONTACT_831990].  If agreement is reached concerning the need for modification, 
this will be made in a formal amendment to the protocol.  All requests for protocol deviations must be approved 
by [CONTACT_1201].  If a deviation occurs, the Investigator must inform the Sponsor and IRB in writing within 10 days.  
 
DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING : The coordinating center (WashU/sponsor) will train all invest igative 
sites.  The sponsor will also monitor the site at various intervals and upon request expects to receive 
intermediate results by [CONTACT_831991] p rogress in accordance with the s ponsor’s 
monitoring procedures and guide lines.  Case Report Forms and Investigator Binders will be reviewed for current 
data.  The sponsor will collect data at the end of the follow -up period.  The sponsor will list the study on 
clinicaltrials.gov as required by [CONTACT_1260].  
 
CONFIDENTIALITY  AND DISCLOSURE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION : As part of this study the Investigator and the 
team at each research facility will keep records of subject participation in the study.  These study records will 
include personal information that the subjects provide including age, sex, etc., the results of the study, 
information about response to treatments, and other medical information relating to participation in the study.   
Under federal law the study records cannot be used or disclosed by [CONTACT_831992] r for research 
purposes unless subjects sign the informed consent authorization.  
The sponsor and its consultants will analyze and evaluate study results and information and may report them 
to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) or other regulat ory agencies in the [LOCATION_002].  Study 
records will be assigned a code number by [CONTACT_831993].  However, The Sponsor and it s 
consultants will have the right to see the complete study records.   
The research facility will review and use the study records for purposes of this study.  De -identified data sets 
will also be shared with potential investors and others related to the b usiness of the Sponsor.  However, no 
identifiers will be shared with these third parties.  They will keep the subject identity confidential and, except 
for the disclosures described above, will not disclose the study records to other parties unless disclos ure is 
required by [CONTACT_2371].  Once the research facility discloses i nformation in the study records  or medical records to the 
Sponsor or its consultants, the information will no longer be protected by [CONTACT_81918].  Because of the need to 
release information to these partie s, absolute confidentiality can not be guaranteed. However, the Sponsor and 
its consultants will only use the information for purposes of the study and will not disclose the study records to 
parties other than the FDA and similar government agen cies, unless disclosure is required by [CONTACT_2371].  If reports or 
articles are written about the study, subjects  will not be identified by [CONTACT_831994] .

Risks and  Benefits  
The interventions compared in this trial are oral UPA  versus LNG -IUS. No serious or life -threatening adverse events are 
expected. Nonetheless, the following measures will be taken to monitor and investigate adverse events. Immediate EC 
failures should be uncommon.  If more than one pregnancy occurs in the LNG -IUS arm, an urgent DSMB meeting w ill be 
convened to discuss the preliminary outcomes.  These immediate failures must be put into context of the number of 
long -term (6 and 12 -month) failures to determine if the trial will continue.   
According to the Prescribing Information, the most commo n adverse reactions ( > 5%) to UPA are headache (18%), 
abdominal pain (12%), nausea (12%), dysmenorrhea (9%), fatigue (6%), and dizziness (5%).   The most common adverse 
reactions to the LNG -IUS reported in clinical trials (> 10% users) are uterine/vaginal bleeding alterations (51.9%), 
amenorrhea (23.9%), intermenstrual bleeding and spotting (23.4%), abdominal /pelvic pain (12.8%) and ovarian cysts 
(12%).   With any IUD insertion, there are risks of infection (<1%) and uterine perforation (approximately 0.1%) . 
 
Pregnancy  
 UPA is 93 -94% effective in preventing pregnancy  
 LNG -IUS:  We hypothesize the LNG -IUS will be as effective as the Copper IUD for EC  
  
If participant reports a positive pregnancy test, we will: 1) invite the participant in for pregnancy testing  and 
transvaginal ultrasound to confirm location and dating of pregnancy.  If the LNG -IUS is in place and intrauterine 
pregnancy  is confirmed , we will recommend and complete removal of IUD.  
 
Pregnancy with IUD  
 Increased risk of spontaneous abortion  
 Increased risk of infection in the uterus  
 Early delivery of fetus if pregnancy continued and IUD left in place  
 
The impact of increased EC access (some forms are now available over -the-counter) on population outcomes and 
concluded that although use of h as EC increased, there has been no demonstrable reduction in unintended pregnancy.  
By [CONTACT_22242], increased uptake of IUDs in an at -risk population has been shown to dramatically reduce unintended 
pregnancy and abortion rates.  The continued highly effectiv e pregnancy prevention the IUD provides beyond the post -
coital period offers a unique opportunity to effect change in the stagnant unintended pregnancy and abortion rates in 
this country.  
Use of the LNG -IUD as an EC method has tremendous public health imp lications. The device is extremely well liked by 
[CONTACT_831997]. The numerous non -contraceptive 
benefits of the LNG -IUD and improved bleeding profile have led to increase uptake when compare d to the copper IUD.

SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER:   
 The pi[INVESTIGATOR_810363] 40% had 10% improvement in 6MWD, 50% had improved FC, and 17% had both
1. 
From these data we calculate that 73% had either 10% improvement in 6MWD or improved functional status. Assuming metformin or the exercise arm will have similar response rate, and the placebo group will have 40% response rate, thought to be due to traini ng 
effect potentially, we need [ADDRESS_1120817] 80% power at 0.[ADDRESS_1120818] between the two interventions will put its response rate above 73%. Thus the combination vs. placebo comparison will have at least 80%, likely better power. From past experience coupled with the low risk, low side effect profile interventions, we estimate a dropout rate of less than 10%
1. We will 
enroll 40 subjects to ensure 35 completed subjects per group. The total target enrollment is 160 over 4.5 years.  
DATA ANALYSIS:  
The primary analyses will focus on metformin vs placebo, exercise vs placebo, and metformin + exercise vs placebo comparisons on the primary endpoint. Since the evaluation of metformin or exercise will be reported as if they were independent studies and the combination arm versus placebo comparison serves to corroborate findings of the two separate comparisons, in addition to evaluating an 
additive or synergistic effect, we will not adjust for multiple comparisons. For binary endpoints, the 
Pearson chi -square or Fischer’s exact test will be 
used to assess between treatment arms difference. Logistic regressions will be conducted to examine the treatment effect while adjusting for important covariates such as baseline 6MWD, functional status,

Protocol Date: 12. 26.[ADDRESS_1120819]. Multivariable regressions (general linear models) will be conducted to examine the treatment effect while adjusting for important covariates such baseline 6MWD, functional status, and age.  We have designed the study to minimize the potential for missing data. Subjects who drop out will be replaced up to a total of [ADDRESS_1120820] missing data, a multiple- imputation 
procedure as implemented in the areglmpute  function 
in the Hmisc package in R (R Package; Version 3.0-10) will be used to assess the impact of missing data. The analyses with imputation will mainly serve as sensitivity analyses.

 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by [CONTACT_810385], right heart failure and death. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_810364], none are curative or address the primary molecular drivers of this highly morbid disease. Work by [CONTACT_810386], insulin resistance and cardiac lipotoxicity in PAH. We have published that glucose intolerance is common in human PAH and impacts survival. We have also assessed the effects of insulin- mediated 
mitochondrial lipid metabolism on the right ventricle (RV) and demonstrated that lipid deposition may be a key feature of RV dysfunction in PAH. Important questions remain: do interventions against insulin resistance improve PAH? Are there specific patients most likely to benefit from interventions against insulin resistance? Drug therapy, e.g. metformin, and exercise are the major currently practical interventions against insulin resistance in PAH. Further, we and others have published that PAH patients are highly 
sedentary with reduced skeletal muscle function, suggesting that activity may be a modifiable feature of PAH. Exercise is known to be safe in PAH, but implementation in the US is limited by  [CONTACT_810387]. Our group recently showed that linking activity 
monitoring, e.g. fitbit, with automated, personalized text prompts to encourage activity led to a 300% increase in step counts. This approach may provide an innovative, inexpensive mechanism to increase activity in PAH, and thereby [CONTACT_810388]. The mechanisms by [CONTACT_810389]- sensitizing interventions may 
improve 6MWD and outcomes in PAH is unknown, however.  
 
 We propose to test the hypothesis that interventions to improve insulin resistance 
will improve exercise capacity and WHO functional class in PAH. We propose three 
specific aims to test this 1) A prospective 2x2 factorial design 12- week clinical trial of 
metformin or placebo and activity intervention or usual care to assess effect on six 
minute walk and WHO functional class, 2) Assessment of the interventions in Aim 1 in a 
subset of patients on RV and peripheral muscle function and lipid content and marker s 
of pulmonary vascular disease to define how these interventions may work in PAH and 3) Identify and prospectively test peripheral blood markers of metformin response in PAH.  The broad goals of this work are to demonstrate the efficacy and mechanisms of interventions against insulin resistance in PAH and to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from these interventions, moving to precision medicine in PAH.

minimally important distance of about 33m3. Most drug therapy for PAH improves

clinical outcomes in PAH.

are NYHA functional class III with symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath with less than ordinary activity
23. Although once thought to be potentially dangerous24, recent 
studies show exercise to be safe and effective at improving functional capacity. It is important to consider that in the context of PAH, “exercise” is equivalent to a mild or moderate increase in physical activity, such as sustained walking. Thus, the two terms can be used interchangeably in reference to this population. In a landmark study, Mereles et al. tested an intensive physical activity program in patients with severe PAH on stable therapy
25. The intervention arm underwent three weeks of inpatient 
rehabilitation involving several hours per day of supervised walking, bicycle ergometer training, and dumbbell training followed by a 12 week home program. In the control 
group, the three inpatient weeks involved counseling, relaxation therapy, and activities 
of daily living. 6MWT distance in the intervention arm increased by 96±61 meters versus a decrease of -15±54 meters in the control group (p<0.0001). Importantly, the effect of 
exercise on functional  capacity and quality of life is additive to standard medical 
therapy. Since this trial, others have validated the efficacy of inpatient exercise programs in PAH
26-29. All of these studies have been performed in Europe where

In the [LOCATION_002], major insurers and Medicare do not currently reimburse cardiopulmonary rehabilitation for pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, an inpatient physical activity program is infeasible in the [LOCATION_002]
30. Moreover, the intensity of 
these interventions and requirement for travel make them impractical for many patients and poorly scalable to the general PAH population. These studies provide import ant 
evidence for the efficacy of increasing physical activity, but the methods present significant obstacles to widespread adoption, underscoring the need for more pragmatic interventions.

pulmonary arterial pressure (3- 5mmHg), suggesting that physical activity does not 
ameliorate pulmonary vascular disease25. Potential alternative mechanisms include 
improvement in RV function, systemic metabolism, and/or skeletal muscle function. Although increased pulmona ry blood flow has
 been observed after training 
programs in PAH patients24, the effects on RV function were not described. Thus, it 
is unknown if improved pulmonary flow is due to enhanced RV function. Insulin resistance is common in
 PAH (even in lean patients) and linked to pulmonary 
vascular disease and RV dysfunction1,13- 14, 16, 32. Increased  physical activity may 
improve insulin resistance, thereby [CONTACT_541344]/or RV function. Finally, skeletal muscle metabolism is abnormal in PAH patients, exhibited by [CONTACT_810390]
2,33- 36. Skeletal 
muscle dysfunction contributes to reduced functional capacity in PAH29,36. Physical 
activity improves skeletal muscle function in PAH29,37,38, but has not been tested in 
the context of an unsupervised, pragmatic randomized trial. This study will be the first to probe several potential mechanisms of improved exercise capacity in the context of a randomized physical activity interventio n in the PAH population . 
1.5 Mobi le health tools to promote behavioral change.  
Mobile health (mHealth) technology has been used to promote behavioral change in a wide range of chronic conditions. Physical inactivity is a known modifiable cardiovascular risk factor
39, yet less than half of the US adult population meets the 
goal of at least 150 minutes per week of moderate activity40. A 2012 Cochrane 
review confirmed the efficacy of telephone and web- based interventions to increase 
physical activity41. Recent  advances in mHealth technology – particularly the 
widespread use of Bluetooth compatible accelerometers – now allow remote 
monitoring of physical activity and real time data tracking. Wearable accelerometers 
provide accurate measurements of steps and activity in three dimensions. These devices are popular with consumers and often recommended by [CONTACT_13922], but there are very limited data on their effectiveness at increasing
 activity42-44. The 
Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Management (TEXT ME) trial demonstrated that a personalized,
 text-based intervention in subjects with coronary heart  disease 
resulted significant reductions in LDL, blood pressure, and smoking and an increase

mActive trial that combining behavioral change based text messages with activity 
tracking led to a marked increase in step counts and aerobic activity46. A key 
innovation of the mActive trial was the addition of “smart” texting that adapted to real time activity data. Behavioral change elements such as coaching texts appear to be a necessary addition to simple activity tracking
44. A mHealth activity 
intervention is an attractive approach in PAH  for several reasons: 1) PAH is 
associated with baseline functional impairment and proven efficacy of physical activity; 2) no requirement for proximity to a major hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541323];
 
3) cost-effective intervention compared with standard therapy;  and 4) highly  
amenable  to a multi -site trial, which is critical for Phase  III studies in a rare disease. 
Given the success of similar interventions in other populations, testing of a mHealth 
intervention in PAH seems  warranted.

about the importance of wearing their device from a secure email address created 
for this study. Subjects can email this account with study questions. If there is loss of data transmission for a full day, subjects will be emailed with a reminder to wear their device and/or reestablish a connection with their phone. After [ADDRESS_1120844] regularly scheduled clinic visits with their treating physician, they will be counseled not to reveal their group assignment . 
1.15 Run- in Period and Step Count Targets  
We will use a two- week run -in period, which will improve our ability to identify a true 
baseline step count and reduce dropout after randomization. Participants will wear the Fitbit Charge HR device 24 hours a day for seven days a week (excluding only bathing or showering) to determine their baseline daily step count. We will assume a Hawthorne or observer effect during the first week of the run- in period and discard 
this data. The baseline daily step count will be calculated as total steps during run-in Week 2 divided by 7 days . Randomization will occur after the run-in phase to 
account for potential dropout during this period.
 Participants displaying 
noncompliance during the run- in period will not be randomized. Noncompliance will be 
defined as having more than one bad data or no data day per week. However, depending on the reason for noncompliance, this requirement may be waived at the 
discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_36749] . 
The initial daily step target  Weeks 1 -4 for the intervention group will be 20% higher 
than the run- in baseline value. For example, if the run-in daily step count is 2,000 
steps/day, the daily step target for Weeks 1- 4 will be 2,400 steps/day. An increment 
of 20% was selected because it reflects the average increase in treadmill workload achieved over 4 weeks in chronic obstructive lung disease patients with PH who attend pulmonary rehabilitation at our facility. Average daily step counts during Week 4 will be calculated and used to define the target (20% above the Week 4 
average) for Weeks 5- 8. The daily target for Weeks 9- [ADDRESS_1120845] the increase in the daily step target. Outliers will be identified based on preset qualifications for days providing 
good data.

pregnancy test will be assessed at screening and [ADDRESS_1120858] focused on metrics, which are predictors of survival in PAH, including RV strain and qualitative RV function.  The 
following metrics will be obtained: 1) tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE); 2) RV & LV ejection fraction
51; 3) RV fractional area change; 4) tricuspid annular velocity 
(S’);  5) tricuspid regurgitant (TR) velocity; 6) RV systolic pressure (estimated from the 
equation: RV systolic pressure = 4(maximum TR velocity)2 + right atrial pressure); 7) 
right atrial pressure52; 8) RV & LV diastolic function53; 9) RV free wall longitudinal 
strain54-55. All measurements will be performed according to the American Society  of 
Echocardiography guidelines51-53. 
 Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS)  
a. Cardiac Proton MRS  
Patients will undergo cardiac metabolic assessment in the VUIIS using a Philips [ADDRESS_1120859]. A 2x1x3cm3 voxel is placed over the 
interventricular septum to avoid contamination from epi[INVESTIGATOR_618668]. Water (suppressed and unsuppressed) spectra are collected to serve as an internal reference for chemical shift offset and fat concentration
97. PRESS spectra (echo time, 30 ms) with and without 
water suppression are performed to quantify fat measurements98. Peak amplitudes of 
water and fat are measured using spectral processing software (Spectroview; Philips Medical Systems) . Lipid content is expressed as percent triglyceride (%TG) versus 
water content, using the formula: signal amplitude of triglyceride divided by [CONTACT_810398] x 100. The usual components of a cardiac MRI will also be obtained from the MRS scan. Data will be analyzed by a blinded observer (Brittain).  
b. Skeletal Muscle Proton MRI and MRS  
After a [ADDRESS_1120860], patients will undergo skeletal muscle metabolic assessment in the VUIIS using a Philips 3 Tesla system  at screening and week 12 visits .  Subjects will 
lie supi[INVESTIGATOR_810365] a

the quadriceps  muscle and water and lipid spectra are obtained by a point -resolved 
spectroscopy sequence.  Finally, whole- body fat -water images will be acquired.  
Lipid content and composition will be analyzed as described for the R V57-58. Lipid 
content is expressed as percent triglyceride (%TG) versus water content, using the 
formula: signal amplitude of triglyceride divided by [CONTACT_810398] x 100.  To 
calculate the quadriceps contractile tissue cross -sectional area, the maximum cross -
sectional area will be calculated and adjusted by [CONTACT_810399].  
 Skeletal Muscle Function  
After the MRI and MRS, the patients will undergo a skeletal muscle function test 
using a workout chair that  will take place in VUIIS. Equipment used will 
include a leg -extension Ergometer chair  including lumbar support and 
seatbelt straps , that will allow us to measure the strength of a patient’s leg 
kick. This device will solely be used for research purposes. It is not being 
used to diagnose or treat disease and is not intended to be marketed for commercial use. The muscle fatigue protocol has demonstrated the ability to 
induce fatigue in the quadriceps muscles in both patients and healthy controls. Key outcomes of the protocol include measures of absolute muscle strength (i.e. maximal knee extensor torque) before, d uring, and following 
exercise.  Percent loss in maximal voluntary contraction magnitude during 
the fatigue protocol serves as the primary measure of fatigability.  
a. Strength  
We will assess leg extensor  muscle strength using an isometric  dynamometer as 
previously published29 , both at the screening and the week [ADDRESS_1120861] procedures are as follows: The subject will warm up with about [ADDRESS_1120862] . The subjects will then perform 
3-5 maximum voluntary contractions (MVC s), each lasting [ADDRESS_1120863] value recorded from three 
contractions performed using good technique and closely matched in force output will 
be used for the muscle strength endpoint.  The total time required for strength testing 
procedures is expected to be about 60 minutes.  
 
b. Fatigue  
We will assess leg extensor  muscle fatigue using a progressive, submaximal isometric 
exercise protocol, both at the screening and week 12 visits .  
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  38 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.[ADDRESS_1120864] procedures are as follows: The fatigue protocol requires the subject to perform 
6 sets of submaximal contractions in which s/he matches the effort level to a target intensity. Training the subject to perform the effort -matching procedure will typi [INVESTIGATOR_810366] 5- [ADDRESS_1120865] is able to match his/her effort level to the target intensity, s/he will be allowed about [ADDRESS_1120866] will perform 
6 sets of 12 contractions with a 40% duty cycle (4s contraction and 6s relaxation), and each set of contractions will be followed by [CONTACT_810400]. The initial submaximal target force 
will be 20% of the previously measured MVC (section 1.22.11.a) and will be 
incremented by 10% every set until 70% MVC. After the subject completes the fatigue protocol, s/he will perform a single MVC every 3 minutes through a total of 12 minutes of recovery time. The total time required for the fatigue protocol is expected to be between 45 and 60 minutes.  
Fatigue will be expressed as % drop in MVC  during the fatigue protocol compared with 
the pre- fatigue MVC force. Recovery will be expressed as the % recovery of MVC force 
that was lost during the fatigue protocol at the 12 minute time point. Secondary analyses of force recovery will occur for the 3, 6, and 9 minute time points.

b. Patient Satisfaction: Patient satisfaction will be assessed using a 
customized survey developed for A Mobile Health Intervention in 
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension  trial and adapted for the PAH 
population.  
c. Side effects and tolerability of interventions  including metformin. 
 Medication Regimen Escalation/Reduction 
The addition of new therapy for PAH indicates disease worsening (or subsequent) right heart failure. New PAH -specific medications added to the subjects’ medical regimen 
and the dates when added will be recorded during the study. Often, specific PAH medicat ions which are administered at a stable dose have increased dosing with clinical 
worsening (specifically, prostacyclin analog therapy). All dose changes will therefore be recorded.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371480] -sided heart failure  
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371481]/or right -sided heart failure will be 
defined as a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371482]/or PAH symptoms (e.g., syncope) refractory to outpatient increases in dose or frequency of diuretics or specific PAH medications.  
We will record all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371483]. Records from each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371484]. These records will be reviewed by [CONTACT_39109] (DSMB), which is unrelated to the study.  
 Death  
Cardiovascular D eath: We define as cardiovascular death:  
1) sudden death 
2) death preceded by  [CONTACT_548486]: 
a) cardiogenic shock defined by [CONTACT_5640]:  
i. hypotension resulting in a failure to maintain normal renal  
ii.  cerebral function for >15 minutes prior to death)  
b) heart failure symptoms or signs requiring one of the following: 
i. intravenous therapy or oxygen in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445199]. confinement to bed  
in the absence of secondary causes (such as systemic infection or dysfunction of intravenous or subcutaneous medication delivery devices) or alternative causes of death.  
Non-Cardiovascular D eath: A death which does not meet the criteria above will be 
considered a non- cardiovascular death.

to demographics and baseline measurements related to efficacy and safety without 
formal statistical testing. 
1.24 Statistical Analysis  
The primary analyses will focus on metformin vs placebo, exercise vs placebo, and metformin + exercise vs placebo comparisons on the primary endpoint. Since the evaluation of metformin or exercise will be reported as if they were independent studies and the combination arm versus placebo comparison serves to corroborate findings of the two separate comparisons, in addition to evaluating an additive or synergistic effect, we will not adjust for multiple comparisons. For binary endpoints, the Pearson chi -squa re or Fischer’s exact test will be used to assess between 
treatment arms difference. Logistic regressions will be conducted to examine the treatment effect while adjusting for important covariates such as baseline 6MWD, functional status, age, and study cite. Model over -fitting will be avoided by 
[CONTACT_810401].  Continuous endpoints will be analyzed using either two -sample t -test 
or ANOVA, or non- parametric methods Wilcoxon Rank Sum test or Kruskal -Wallis 
test. Multivariable regressions (general linear models) will be conducted to examine the treatment effect while adjusting for important covariates such as baseline 
6MWD, functional status, age, and study site.  We have designed the study to minimize the potential for missing data. Subjects who drop out will be replaced up to a total of [ADDRESS_1120869] missing data, a multiple -imputation procedure as implemented in the areglmpute function in the 
Hmisc package in R (R Package; Version 3.0- 10) will be used to assess the impact 
of missing data. The analyses with imputation will mainly serve as sensitivity analyses .  
1.25 Missing Data and Dropouts  
For all endpoints, the primary analysis will be intention -to-treat (ITT) : all subjects 
randomized with a post -intervention endpoint measurement will be included. For 
endpoints based on measurements collected at the end of the study, individuals who do not complete follow -up cannot be included in analyses of those endpoints.  
Subjects who stop study interventions at any point of the study but agree to come 
back for the final data collection will be invited to do so to facilitate the ITT analysis.  
A per -protocol analysis will be conducted as a secondary ana lysis for the primary 
endpoints. Any subject who is identified as a major protocol violator will not be included. Major protocol violators will be defined as subjects randomized but non- compliant with wearing the accelerometer (i.e.  missing ≥ ½ of total days)  and others 
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol

determines a list of protocol violators before data un- blinding, but this is a single 
blinded study and that Anna and Evan know who gets what and the endpoints, that complicates  it a bit) .  
Subjects who drop out will be replaced up to a total of [ADDRESS_1120870] case for subjects on the control, or assuming the observed mean of the control group for the subjects on the intervention.  A multiple 
imputation procedure implemented in the aregImpute function in the Hmisc package in R (R Package; Version 3.0-10) will be used. The analysis with imputation will 
serve primarily as a sensitivity analysis.  The potential drop- out is considered in the 
power calculation to minimize its impact.

we calculate that 73% had either 10% improvement in 6MWD or improved functional status.

Thus,  the combination vs. 
placebo comparison will have at least 80%, likely better power. From past experience coupled with the low risk, low side effect profile interventions, we estimate a dropout rate of less than 10%

Serious protocol violations such as discontinuation of the intervention unrelated to AEs 
will be carefully recorded and regularly reviewed by [CONTACT_079]. Remedial 
changes in procedure will be recommended where feasible to reduce the incidence of

septicemia; acute or chronic metabolic acidosis with or without coma (including 
diabetic ketoacidosis)  
 Boxed Warning    
A boxed warning has been issued for metformin related to the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_381322].  The risk is increased in patients with acute congestive heart failure, dehydration, excessive alcohol intake, hepatic or renal impairment, or sepsis.  Conditions that increase the risk of lactic acidosis on metformin treatment are all exclusion criteria for this study.  Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_810369], we do not anticipate this to be a significant complication. If clinical ly 
significant lactic acidosis is diagnosed for clinical indications, the DSMB and IRB will be notified as per protocol.  
 Iodinated Contrast  
Metformin therapy will be discontinued prior to or at the time of intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media (potential for acute alteration in renal function) should a subject require contrast during the course of this study. Metformin will be withheld for [ADDRESS_1120877] protected mode. Due to the nature of text messaging technology, there is a small potential privacy risk

1.44 Definitions  
 Unanticipated Problem (UP ) 
 Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
i. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
ii. related or possibly related to participation in the research (Possibly related to 
participation in the research means there is a reasonable possibility that the AE, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
iii. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.     
 Adverse E vent (AE)   
Any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as AEs.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnormal ity: 
i. results in study withdrawal  
ii. is associated with a serious AE  
iii. is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
iv. leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
v. is considered by [CONTACT_810403] E vent (SAE)   
Adverse reactions are classified as serious or non- serious.  A serious adverse event  is 
any AE that is:  
i. fatal 
ii. life-threatening  
iii. requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_810373]. results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
v. a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
vi. an important medical event  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For ex ample, 
drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in- subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_810374]. All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non- serious AEs.

Protocol Version #: 6 .1  48 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    
 Suspected Adverse Reaction   
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the 
adverse event.  For reporting purposes, "reasonable possibility" means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug/investigational  product and 
the adverse event.  
 Internal Adverse Event   
Adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_57435](s) at their own Field Center.  
 External Adverse Event   
Adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_810404].  
1.45 Classifying AEs  
 Severity  
The intensity of the AE is classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events v4.0 ( CTCAEv4.0) .  Grade refers to the s everity (intensity) of the AE:  
If the intensity of an AE worsens during study drug administration, only the worst intensity should be reported on the AE page. If the AE lessens in intensity, no change in the severity is required.  
i. CTCAEv4 Grade 1: mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention is not indicated.  
ii. CTCAEv4 Grade 2: moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is 
indicated; limiting to age- appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL; 
instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc).  
iii. CTCAEv4 Grade 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life 
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39676]; disabling; limiting to self -care ADL (self -care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).  
iv. CTCAEv4 Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention is 
indicated.  
v. CTCAEv4 Grade 5: death due to an AE.  
In this grading system, severity is not equivalent to seriousness.  For example, a SAE would be any event which was life- threatening or disabling (Grade 4) or fatal (Grade 5)

AEs must be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur or were unexpected, meaning not anticipated based on current knowledge found in the protocol, investigator brochure, product insert, or label.  
Expected:  an AE known to be associated with the intervention or condition under study.  
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  49 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    OHRP defines an unexpected AE  as any AE occurring in one or more subjects 
participating in a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not 
consistent with either:  
i. the known or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the procedures involved in 
the research that are described in a) the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the 
current IRB -approved informed consent document, and b) other relevant sources 
of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or  
ii. the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition   of the subject(s) experiencing the AE and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the AE.  
 Relatedness  
i. Definite: the AE is clearly related to the research procedures  
ii. Probably: the AE is likely related to the research procedures  
iii. Possible: the AE may be related to the research procedures  
iv. Unlikely: the AE is doubtfully related to the research procedures  
v. Unrelated: the AE is clearly not related to the research procedures  
Possibly related to participation in the research: There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459].    
For each identified AE, an AE entry on the appropriate form will be completed using the above classifications as soon as possible, updating as necessary. Reporting procedures should be started immediately (within 24 hours)  upon learning of a SAE or UP.

administration of study treatment ( week 15 phone call).   
 Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition. At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definition of an AE must also be recorded and documented as an AE.   
 Post-study AE  
All unresolved SAEs or AEs that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study or study drug should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol

Protocol Date: 12. 26.[ADDRESS_1120888] to report any subsequent event(s) that the 
subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Laboratories will not be drawn unless clinically indicated.  A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an AE if any one of the following conditions is 
met:  
i. The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm 
the abnormality  
ii. The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
iii. The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341870] a serious AE unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an AE if the condition meets the criteria for an AE.  Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an AE in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
AEs and SAEs which do not fall under the expedited reporting procedure requirements will be reported by [CONTACT_810405]. The Field Center  
Investigator/designee should keep originals or photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_810375], including facsimile confirmations, and file them in the participant's file. All Field Center Investigator s should ensure that  all routine AE(s) are reported to ensure 
the CC has accurate data for periodic or annual reporting requirements  to the sIRB . 
 
 
 
1.47 Expedited Reporting P roc
 edures  
The Field Center Investigator should notify the CC, in an expedited manner, of those 
events listed in the table below related to study participation. The CC will then notify the sIRB, DSMB and NHLBI.

• Subject identifiers  
• Demographic data 
• Nature of the event  
• Severity of the event  
• Probable relationship (causality) of AE to study procedure 
• Date and time of AE onset  
• Date and time of AE resolution, if available  
• Concomitant medications that the participant was taking for an underlying 
medical condition or disease and the therapeutic agents used for the treatment of the adverse event  
• Clinical assessment of participant conducted at time of SAE/AE  
• Results of any laboratory and/or diagnostic procedures, and treatment  
• Follow- up plan  
• Outcome  
• Autopsy findings (if appropriate)  
The Field Center Investigator will provide details about the AE to the CC as they become available. If additional information cannot be obtained for whatever reason, this will be documented. The Field Center Investigator should inform the CC when no other information is expected. The Field Center Investigator should provide the CC with a logical, complete, and accurate narrative description of the AE based upon the above information. The Field Center Investigator should promptly determine an assessment of causality.  
The CC will report this information to the sIRB for initial assessment and subsequent reporting will occur as outlined on the table. The sIRB will communicate to the CCC (and the local IRBs) if the event requires revisions to the informed consent form or o ther 
measures. The sIRB will work with the local IRB and CCC to determine if any corrective actions should be initiated as a result. A formal determination will be provided to the sIRB within 1 business week and the CCC will inform all Field Center Investigators of the corrective action (e.g., revision of informed consent form, protocol, CRF). The CCC will also report any qualifying events to the DSMB and NHLBI as noted in the schedule. The CCC and any Field Center Investigator should file copi[INVESTIGATOR_810377]. 
 Other R eportable E vents: 
The following events are also reportable to the sIRB:  
• Any AE that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, protocol or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_810406].  
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of severity or frequency. For example:  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of the research study is of no therapeutic value.

Protocol Version #: 6 .1  53 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    • Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol.  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior sIRB review to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to a research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_116576], or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
1.[ADDRESS_1120889]’s best interest.  
A subject should be withdrawn from the study if there is:  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• PI [INVESTIGATOR_810378]- to-treat analysis, even if the subject is 
withdrawn from the treatment portion of the protocol (either due to subject, physician, or investigator decision), it is imperative to continue with the scheduled follow- up 
assessments both for the safety of the subject and for completeness of data collection. This will be explained to potential subjects at the time of informed consent. The importance of compliance with study visits will be reinforced throughout the trial.  
1.[ADDRESS_1120890] will be considered, prior to the formal study 
unblinding, only if the following circumstances are met: 1) knowledge of the treatment assignment is required to initiate appropriate therapy for an AE or 2) if the safety of the subject  is at serious risk if the treatment is continued without the knowledge of treatment 
assignment. The decision to unmask will be made by [CONTACT_810407],  and Medical 
Monitor . The DSMB must be notified of the decision as soon as possible.  
Confidentiality of Study Data   
In this study, each patient will be assigned a unique Participant ID number (PID) when 
his/her demographic and race/ethnicity information is entered for the first time. Follow -
up data are subsequently entered as needed when a patient has a clinic visit. The unique PID number remains with each patient permanently and is matched with all new 
data entered. The PID number and patient identifiers are directly linked in the study database.  
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  54 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    The CC at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center  will also generate a Global Unique 
Identifier (GUID) for each subject using a NIH tool client. This is an identifying code 
assigned to a single research participant so that data can be compi[INVESTIGATOR_810379] (PII), even if the data are collected at different locations or by [CONTACT_371517]. The GUID is created using PII (including, current name, legal given name [CONTACT_371521] (first, middle, and last), date of birth, city of birth, state of birth, country of birth, and physical sex at birth). Data including the GUID (without other identifiers) is considered de- identified by [CONTACT_810408]. Personal identifying information used to generate the GUID will be erased by [CONTACT_810409].  
The potential for data sharing has been included in the informed consent. Data releases to investigators for approved research purposes and analyses (after review and approval by [CONTACT_810410] a Data Use Agreement) will be stripped of identifiers using a “Safe Harbor” approach. If an approved investigator has conducted a separate study in which a shared participant has also consented to the use of a GUID then this will be retained in the data release; however, for all other data releases the GUID will be removed.  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject  
of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information 
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, 
attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
Several mechanisms will be in place to maintain confidentiality. All of the data will be reported in aggregate. Each subject in all phases of the study will be assigned a unique study Participant Identification (PID) number to be used on all data forms, st udy 
records, and blood samples. A list of patient names and code numbers will be maintained separately in locked file cabinets or on password protected computers. Only the investigators and project staff will have access to this information. No other personally identifiable information will be available. We will also obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH for this study before consent of the first patient.  
1.50 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
Consent forms, medical history data, and study data are stored in secured files, either in locked file cabinets or in a locked room separate from medical records and coded such 
that all subject identifiers have been removed. As an additional precaution all  HIPAA 
regulated information is stored in an electronic file separate from other study data. Only 
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  55 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    approved study staff (determined by [CONTACT_978]) will be given authorization to access the 
database. Bio- specimens are processed and labeled with barcode labels that include 
the subjects electronically generated study code and date of sample collection. The bio-specimens are stored in locked freezers in the study Laboratory; only approved study staff has access to the keys for each freezer. Access to the electronic freezer inventory of the specimens is kept on a secure password protected computer.  
1.[ADDRESS_1120891] of the study will be made in writing to the 
investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the NIH before commencement of this study.   
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study. This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for 
review and approval by [CONTACT_810411] (and to Field Center IRBs if necessary for 
local content review).  The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent 
form, must be obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure.  The 
consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_17257], and the 
investigator -designated research professional obtaining the consent.

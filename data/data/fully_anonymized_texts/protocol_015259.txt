Abstract  
 
Introduction: Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI) is a common condition with a prevalence of 9 -
31% in women in the [LOCATION_002]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_156788], a high number of women have 
symptoms refractory to first - and second -line treatment 
approaches.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                         
                                         
Aims: The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of 
percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) and mirabegron treatment versus PTNS with 
placebo on change in the number of UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_156789] a 12 -week treatment 
course.   Secondary aims include comparing the efficacy of combined treatment of PTNS and 
mirabegron versus PTNS with placebo on improvement in urinary incontinence symptom 
specific distress and quality of life related to UUI ov er a 12 -week course of PTNS.  
 
Methods: A total of 54 consented participants will be recruited and randomized with 27 patients 
in the PTNS with mirabegron (daily 50 mg dose for the 12 -week course) group and 27 patients 
in the PTNS with placebo group. Demogr aphics and baseline data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_32206]’s 
t-test and chi -squared test or Fischer’s Exact test as appropriate.   
 
Results:   TBD 
 
Anticipated Conclusion:   We anticipate that combination therapy will prove superior to 
monotherapy for reducing the number of UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_17767] a 12 -week treatment course.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Specific Aims:  
Introduction/Background:  Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI) remains a challenging clinical 
problem for urogynecologists as they treat women and seek to find better thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  There is a 
wealth of literature addressing individual therapi[INVESTIGATOR_156790], second, and third line treatments for 
UUI.  There are three main third line treatment options for UUI including percutaneous tibial 
nerve stimulation (PTNS), sacral neuromodu lation, and intradetrusor botox.  At the current time, 
there are limited studies that have looked at a combination of second and third -line therapy 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_156791].  While some anticholinergic medications have been studied in combination 
with percutaneou s tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) such as solifenacin, tolterodine, and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], 
there is limited data on the combination of mirabegron, a beta -[ADDRESS_181621], and PTNS for 
treatment of refractory UUI.  The studies that looked at anticholinergic medications in  
combination with PTNS revealed improvement in UUI compared to PTNS plus placebo.  
However, there are patients who do not tolerate anticholinergic medications well because of 
side effects. A relatively new finding as reported by [CONTACT_156803] 
(AUGS) about avoiding anticholinergic medications in women greater than age 70 secondary to 
increased risk for cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease is further impetus to 
conduct this trial [1].  The rationale for studying mirabe gron in combination with PTNS versus 
PTNS plus placebo is important as mirabegron does not have the significant side effect profile 
that anticholinergic medications have and better tolerated in the older population. Therefore, 
more research should be perfo rmed to evaluate the effect of the combination of mirabegron and 
PTNS for refractory UUI.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the combination of PTNS and 
mirabegron and compare that to PTNS plus placebo in the treatment of refractory UUI.  
 
Hypothesis :  Combination therapy of PTNS and mirabegron, a beta -[ADDRESS_181622], will contribute to 
greater improvement in the number of urgency urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_156792] a 
3-day bladder diary compared to PTNS plus placebo in women.  
 
Method:  This is a randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy of combination therapy with 
PTNS plus mirabegron to PTNS plus placebo in women with refractory urgency urinary 
incontinence.  
 
Primary Aim :  The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of combined treatment of 
PTNS and mirabegron versus PTNS plus placebo on change in the number of UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] 
12 weeks.   
 
Secondary Aims : 
 Comparing urinary symptom specific distress and qualit y of life over a 12 -week course 
of PTNS.   
 Comparing the side effect/adverse event profile of combined treatment of PTNS and 
mirabegron versus PTNS plus placebo over a 12 -week course of PTNS  
 Comparing the treatment efficacy and adverse events of combined t reatment of PTNS 
and mirabegron versus PTNS plus placebo in women > 70 years of age as a sub 
analysis within the study   
 
 
Research Strategy:  
Significance:  Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI), is the complaint of involuntary loss of urine 
associated with urgency [2], a common condition that affects between 9 -31% [3,4] of women 
and is a significant healthcare burden costing up to 19 billion dollars per year inc luding the costs 
of over the counter products such as pads and diapers along with medical evaluation and 
treatment [5].  This condition causes negative impact on sexual and social functioning and can 
be associated with depression.  UUI may be associated wi th neuromuscular problems and may 
be associated with anatomical problems, such as large uterine fibroids, pelvic masses, severe 
uterovaginal prolapse, bladder outlet obstruction, or even severe obesity [6].  First line therapy 
includes behavioral therapy w hile second line therapy includes medication with either 
anticholinergic or beta -[ADDRESS_181623] long been the 
mainstay of second -line treatment for overactive bladder (OAB)/UUI, but have significant side 
effects in cluding dry mouth and constipation [7] which has led to poor patient compliance and 
high discontinuation rates in clinical practice [8,9].  Likewise, as previously mentioned, the 2021 
update from AUGS for OAB recommends avoiding the use of anticholinergic medication in 
women greater than 70 years old due to negative cognitive effects [1,10,11].  The beta -[ADDRESS_181624] as efficacious as anticholinergic me dications for combination therapy with 
PTNS, especially in cases of refractory UUI [11,12].   
 
Refractory UUI indicates consideration of third line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Current third line therapy 
options include Sacral Neuromodulation (SNM), Onabotulinumtoxin A (Bo tox) injected into the 
detrusor muscle during cystoscopy, and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS).  Recent 
interest has peaked with respect to combination of either second and third line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_156793] [13].  Sacral Neuromodulation requires a 
patient to go to the operating room in order to receive treatment for UUI while 
Onabotulinumtoxin A (Botox) requires procedural treatment with injection into the detrusor 
muscle and carries increased risk o f urinary retention and urinary tract infection.  A recent 
retrospective observational cohort study of adult female patients with OAB looked at the delay 
between stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_156794] [14].  Their 
conclusion was that women with OAB who undergo third -line therapy do so on average more 
than [ADDRESS_181625] 
evaluation and diagnostic testing, and mirabegr on use [14].  
 
 
Some patients would prefer a less invasive treatment such as PTNS to more procedural 
modalities of SNM and Botox.  Scientific professional society guidelines advise PTNS as a third 
line treatment [15].  PTNS has been validated via sham -base d trials, as a third line option with 
proven benefit that is less invasive than the other third line options for management of UUI.  
Although researchers have studied PTNS, Botox, and SNM alone and have seen benefit for 
patients, recent interest has peaked  into the efficacy of combination therapy.  Further studies 
are needed regarding combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], particularly those including third line modalities 
[13]. 
 
PTNS in combination with anticholinergic medications has been studied and outcomes 
compared [1 6,17,18,19].  In most of these studies, when PTNS plus placebo is compared to 
PTNS in combination with an anticholinergic medication, the combination therapy was found to 
be more effective than PTNS plus placebo or an anticholinergic medication alone (Tabl e 1).  In 
previous systematic reviews, when PTNS alone was compared to medications (anticholinergics) 
alone, no difference was found and each monotherapy was considered to be equally efficacious 
[20,21].

Because the older population of women is a major focus of this study, it remains 
important to focus on less invasive treatments that are better tolerated by [CONTACT_156804] a whole.  Therefore, because PTNS offers a less invasive approach to  third line 
therapy and because mirabegron does not have the negative cognitive effects that 
anticholinergic meds cause in the geriatric population, this combination of PTNS + mirabegron 
offers great potential for providing better treatment for UUI/OAB, es pecially in women 70 years 
of age or greater.  
 
Given the significant burden associated with UUI/OAB expecially in older women, 
combination therapy of less invasive approach and with PTNS and the mirabegron has fewer 
adverse effects and may provide improved  efficacy, adherence, and safety.  
 
 
Innovation:  The main innovation for this study will be the combination of PTNS with 
mirabegron.  Further research needs to occur on combination therapy that can be offered on an 
outpatient basis to patients that either do not desire to have an invasive procedure or are not 
optimal surgical candidates.  Based upon the previous studies looking at combination therapy 
with PTNS and anticholinergic medications, one can see that PTNS in combination with 
medication is more effi cacious than either medication alone or PTNS plus placebo (Table 1).  
While mirabegron is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, overall, patients 
tolerate it better than anticholinergic medications.  Thus, mirabegron offers hope as a better 
medication combination with PTNS for all age groups of patients.  This study also involves 
looking at the efficacy of combination therapy of PTNS and mirabegron in the geriatric 
population > 70 years of age, as mirabegron has not been associated wit h the exacerbating 
symptoms of dementia that anticholinergic medications do within the geriatric population 
[1,11,12].  Therefore, studying mirabegron in combination with PTNS offers great hope for the 
treatment of refractory UUI in the geriatric populatio n. 
 
Approach:

Intervention  
 
Prior to beginning the treatment intervention, patients who are currently on medical therapy will 
stop medical therapy 2 weeks prior to the start of the trial.  One arm of the study will receive 
PTNS combined with mirabegron and the other ar m of the study will receive PTNS with placebo.  
In the PTNS with mirabegron arm, the patient will take a 50 mg dose daily for 12 weeks of the 
trial.  In the PTNS with placebo arm, the patient will receive a placebo daily during the 12 -week 
trial. PTNS will  be performed as described: The percutaneous approach entails insertion of a 
36-gauge needle electrode at a 60 degree angle approximately 5 cm or 3 finger breadths 
cephalad to the medial malleolus and posterior to the tibia. A portable electrical stimulato r 
delivers an adjustable current in the range of 0.5 ‐9 mA. The generators commonly are set for a 
pulse frequency of 20 Hz with a goal of creating a motor and/or sensory response in the foot. 
The stimulation sessions last for [ADDRESS_181628] -treatment.  
 
 
Secondary Outcomes  
 
 Number of voids on a [ADDRESS_181629] -treatment  
 Number of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) epi[INVESTIGATOR_156797] - vs. post -treatment on a 3 -
day voiding diary  
 Change in symptom distress as measured by [CONTACT_156805] (UDI -6) 
questionnaire pre - vs. post -treatment  
 Change in UUI/OAB quality of life as measured by [CONTACT_156806] (IIQ -7) and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire -Short Form 
(OAB -q SF) questionnaires pre - vs. post -treatment  
 Adverse Events  
Protocol in detail  
Women seen in the Urogynecology and Urology clinics at the University of Alabama at 
Birmingham who ar e seeking treatment for refractory UUI symptoms will be screened.  Patients 
who have failed a credible behavioral therapy intervention and medical therapy or not tolerating 
medical therapy will be evaluated for this study.  Those patients satisfying the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be offered participation.  Informed consent will be reviewed and 
signed with patients wishing to proceed.   
At enrollment, any subjects who are using medical therapy including anticholinergic or 
β3 agonist medications will stop these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_53301] 2 weeks prior to treatment.  Baseline clinical 
data including a 3 -day bladder diary, OAB -q-SF, IIQ -7, UDI -6, and a pain catastrophizing scale 
after washout as indicated will be collected as well as clinical and demographic informat ion.  
Data from subjects’ urodynamic testing will be abstracted from the clinical chart if performed 
within the prior [ADDRESS_181630] 
session of PTNS.  The pati ent will also complete the OAB -q-SF, IIQ -7, and UDI -6.  
Randomization/Allocation  
Patients will be randomized to the PTNS with mirabegron group or PTNS with placebo group in 
a 1:[ADDRESS_181631] more 
improvement in the number of UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_156798].  
Given this hypothesis, based on existing data,[17] a 2 -sided alpha=0.05, the estimate for that 
difference in improvement has been estimated to be 2.[ADDRESS_181632] deviation of 3 and a power of 0.80. Assuming an 
attrition rate of 10%, the total N per arm is estimated to be 27 subjects (a total of 54 subjects) for 
this study. The sample size estimation results are summarized in Table 2.

Data analysis  
For the primary analysis, an intention -to-treat analysis including all eligible patients randomizing 
to treatment will be used.  Baseline clinical and demographic data will be compared between 
groups.  The primary outcome (changes in the number of UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_156797] - vs. post -treatment) 
will be compared via genera l linear models.  
Potential Pi[INVESTIGATOR_156799] [ADDRESS_181633] as one of the Pelvic Floor Disorder Network sites, our center has successfully recruited 
women with urgency urinary incontinence symptoms for the Anticholinergic Therapy vs 
OnabotulinumtoxinA for Urgency Urinary Incontinence trial (ABC trial) and the OnabotulinumA 
vs Sacral Neuromodulation on refractory Urgency Urina ry Incontinence in Women trial 
(ROSETTA trail) [22,23].  Compared to antimuscarinics, the insurance coverage for mirabegron 
is difficult and presents a major obstacle to patients being able to receive mirabegron.  To 
overcome this issue, the study will pro vide the medications.  Given the need for further 
treatments for refractory UUI, these study outcomes will be a significant contribution to the 
current literature and have the potential to influence clinical care.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Timeline  
I am currently in my f irst year of fellowship and if I did not remain at the institution following 
fellowship, I would still be principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_156800].  We have a strong 
research team including co -investigators in the Urogynecology Division, FPMRS fellows,  
research nurse coordinators, and nurses dedicated to research trials. All are focused on 
maintaining a solid infrastructure for success.  
 
Regular research meetings will take place with the team throughout the trial with review 
of clinics to identify poss ible patients and to ensure delegation of tasks for completion of 
enrollment and follow -up. We will also advertise the study on a currently existing social media 
research site and in existing UAB internet periodicals and the Birmingham newspaper. I will al so 
be actively involved in the statistical analysis with the assistance of the Center for Clinical and 
Translational Sciences (CCTS) and Center for Women’s Reproductive Health (CWRH) at UAB.  
My dedication to this project and the research infrastructure in  our division will assist in seeing 
this project through to completion.  
 
Impact for Future Study  
 
Another future innovation in this study draws upon a supplementary study to NOTABLe, a Pelvic 
Floor Disorders Network study evaluating PTNS vs. sham treatmen t for fecal incontinence. 
Genetic polymorphisms associated with placebo effect in the treatment of fecal incontinence 
were assessed [personal communication, Richter].  This supplementary study to NOTABLe 
assessed the relationship between response to PTNS o r sham treatment and genetic single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with treatment response via the COMT val158met 
genetic polymorphism.  In the future as this current study evolves, we would like to have 
patients from both arms of the study prov ide blood samples that one can utilize for further 
analysis characterizing the relationship between SNPs and treatment response.  This 
supplemental analysis will add to the growing literature on the placebome and provide critical 
information for planning f uture pelvic floor studies that account for the variation in an individuals’ 
likelihood of being a placebo responder.  May/June2021:

Statistical Analysis  
This was a randomized controlled trial Double Blinded (providers and patients) looking at 
PTNS+Myrbetriq vs. PTNS+Placebo .    The original sample size calculation noted that we needed [ADDRESS_181636].  Secondly, the primary outcome is the change in the 
number of UUIs  (urge urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) over a [ADDRESS_181637] -trial on a 3 day bladder diary.  Then compare them between t he two groups.   
Other components of the 3 day bladder diary include number of SUI (stress urinary incontinence) 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_156802]. post, number of daytime voids pre vs. post, number of nighttime voids pre vs. 
post, and number of pads used pre vs. po st. 
Secondary outcomes also include the questionnaires of IIQ7, UDI 6, and OABQSF changes pre vs. post -
trial and comparing them.   
This should be laid out in the data table.

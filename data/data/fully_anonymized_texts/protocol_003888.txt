Biomarker and Safety Study of Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672330] (BEN)  
___________________________________________________________________________  
 
Introduction:    
Current monitoring guidelines for treatment with the medication clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672331] (WBC) counts that were based on Caucasian popul ations and do not take 
into account lower white blood cell counts and lower fluctuations seen in people of African descent. This leads to many people of African descent not receiving appropriate care with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. This study will examine  clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672332] a history 
of a low absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), known as Benign Ethnic Neutrop enia (BEN). 
Normal patterns of week -to-week fluctuations in ANC levels in individuals of African ancestry 
with BEN are not known, and no published research has examined variation in genes in 
African ancestry clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]- treated patients with BEN. Conducting such research will generate 
genetic marker and safety data that could be used to expand access to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672333] s who otherwise are eligible to receive this superior treatment option.  
 We have recently been funded by [CONTACT_672462][INVESTIGATOR_672334]. We are working 
closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have obtained an Investigational New Drug (IND) approval for the project.  
 
This protocol outlines the details for an open label prospective study of six months of open 
label  clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672335] a six week period of WBC  count mon itoring to establish 
baseline values. It also contains the modified monitoring guidelines that will be used in BEN 
patients throughout the study . MPRC will be the coordinating site and will be the initial site to 
be IRB approved and running. Subsequently, we will also include Howard University and the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_672336], Lagos, Nigeria.  
 
Background:  
Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling medical illness that starts early in life and results in loss of productivity and poor quality of life. Symptoms in 40- 60% of individuals with 
schizophrenia do not respond to currently available medications. In this subgroup of treatment -
refractory patients, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672337], preventing multiple hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and enabling community 
integration. Furthermore, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672338] -approved indication for 
suicidal ideation. The estimated savings in healthcare costs are $9,000/patient/year for patients on clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672339], and $23,000/patient/year for patients treated with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672340] 2 years. The medication is affordable, readily available, and safe following FDA guidelines based on normative values of absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) in European-ancestry populations.   In African ancestry populations, a deletion mutation of the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines gene ( DARC- null genotype), which abolishes expression of DARC protein, has 
been positively selected for its protective role against malarial infection ( Plasmodium vivax ). 
Page 3 of 28 
 This DARC null mutation has been recently identified as a major determinant of benign ethnic 
neutropenia (BEN) in people of African descent, including African- Americans. BEN, defined as 
the occurrence of neutropenia based on normative values of ANCs in Caucasian populations, 
is not associated with increased susceptibility to infection or agranulocytosis.  
 
In the U.S, compared with European- Americans, African- American patients are less likely to be 
initiated on clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672341] l ikely to be abruptly 
discontinued for ANC counts that fall below the normative values in Caucasians. BEN is the 
likely primary determinant of this barrier to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672342]- American patients. 
However, the relationship between DARC genotype,  ANCs, and occurrence of clinically 
significant fluctuations in ANC during clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672342]- ancestry schizophrenia 
patients is unknown. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_672343] 650 clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-treated sub- Saharan African patients  at the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_672344], Nigeria 
clearly show no increased incidence of agranulocytosis in this ethnic population compared with European ancestry populations.  
 
 
STUDY OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES:  
 
New knowledge is needed to reduce this healthcare disparity and care gap for African-American patients who would otherwise benefit from clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_99646]. To generate this knowledge, the  objectives of the study are: 
  
Aim 1 : To study and understand the normal pattern of white blood cell fluctuations in BEN 
patients.  We will study 250, mostly African ancestry, patients to determine the fluctuations of within -participant WBC and ANC (mean, S.D., frequency and duration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_672345] d, 
moderate or severe neutropenia), measured weekly over a period of (up to) 6 weeks  
 
Hypothesis :  
BEN patients will have lower mean ANC and WBC than normal values reported in the 
literature. The normal variation in ANC and WBC will create sporadic epi[INVESTIGATOR_672346].  
  
Aim 2:  To test to see if people with BEN have a genetic risk that may put them at risk of having 
a naturally lower WBC count than people who are White. We will establish ANC and WBC patterns in both those with and without the DARC  allele.  
 We will also genotype a panel of variants in the human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) complex gene 
recently shown to be associated with agranulocytosis in Caucasian patients, to explore the prevalence of co- occurrence of these HLA variants and the DARC null genotype in BEN 
patients, which might increase risk of agranulocytosis in AA and SSA participants with BEN.  We anticipate that the high risk HLA variants will be in very low frequency in the AA and SSA population  
 
Hypothesis:  Patients with the DARC null allele genotype will have lower ANC and WBC 
than people without the DARC null allele genotype.  
 
Page 4 of 28 
  
Aim 3: To test the safety of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672347]. We also will study the  
normal fluctuations of WBCs and A NCs during 6 months of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_99646] . We will study 
the risk of potential epi[INVESTIGATOR_672348]. We will develop an upper 
95% confidence interval for risk of agranulocytosis (< 500 cells/mm3), which may be compared 
to the known 1% agranulocytosis risk in European ancestry populations treated with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. We will also estimate the risk of serious infection in clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]- treated BEN patients.  
 
Hypothesis 1 (DARC null allele patients):  
The 6- month risk of agranulocytosis in clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] -treated BEN patients will not differ 
from reported rates in the literature. In the DARC null allele patients, normal variation in ANCs and WBC s will create sporadic epi[INVESTIGATOR_672349] s below usual U.S. monitoring 
guidelines (<1500 cells/mm
3), but not higher rates of agranulocytosis or severe 
infection. These patients will have lower mean ANC and WBC than patients without the polymorphism, and not have higher rates of agranulocytosis.   
 
Hypothesis 2:  (non DARC null allele patients)  
BEN patients without the polymorphism  will have higher mean ANC than the group with 
the genetic polymorphism (DARC null alleles) , and will be less likely to have epi[INVESTIGATOR_672350] U.S. monitoring guidelines (<1500 cells/m m3).  We will evaluate 
any identifiable causes (e.g., infection) of low ANC in such participants

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:  
 
• This is a single treatment group, open- label, prospective study. This study will take place at 
three sites; the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center (MPRC), University of Maryland 
School of Medicine, Howard University, and the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_672336], Lagos, Nigeria (FNPHY). The study will begin at the MPRC site and the other sites will come on board only when the studies and consents are fully approved at each site. We will notify the UMB IRB when each site is fully functioning.  
 
• MPRC will b e the lead site for regulatory compliance, coordination, design, leadership, data 
storage and analysis. The Nigerian site and Howard University both are well established research sites with ongoing NIH research and an enriched environment for clinical research. Patients will be enrolled for 9 months duration from a cohort of 250 African 
ancestry (A frican -American  or Nigerian ) subjects who have had evidence of neutropenia 
(ANC<2500 cells/mm
3) in the past 24 months and are otherwise clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672357].  
 
• We w ill enroll a target of approximately [ADDRESS_908744] if needed.  
 
• All participants will b e recommended to undergo [ADDRESS_908745] one week of observation is needed.  This could also go longer if a patient is enrolled and 
clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672358] a short period.  After this period, subjects still meeting eligibility 
criteria will be treated for 6 months with open label clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672359]/ANC

 monitoring. We will minimize the burden of assessments to focus on safety and retention 
and in order to simulate treatment as usual in a naturalistic design.  
 
• Assessments: A full schedule of events is included below. At baseline, all participan ts will 
have a standard medical workup including a physical examination, Body Mass Index (BMI) measurement, and EKG  (In [LOCATION_003] only) . Blood will be collected for complete blood count 
(CBC), Chemistry 14 panel with fasting blood glucose, lipid panel, HIV, thyr oid panel, and 
liver function tests. Additional blood smear analyses for malaria parasites will be performed at FNPHY.  A description of the time points for all of the assessments and laboratories are included in the schedule of events .

 White Blood Cell (WBC) and Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC):  
• All WBC with 3 to 5 part differential  (by [CONTACT_7092][INVESTIGATOR_124054]/or venous, respectively) will be 
obtained at the same time at each drawing when possible (approximately 9am to 12 
pm) to avoid the confound of morning pseudoneutropenia and will be performed weekly for 6 weeks  prior to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672367] 6 months after clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. In participants who 
discontinue clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672368], weekly WBC/ANC measurements will be 
performed for an additional 4 weeks. The WBC and ANC at the two US sites will be performed by [CONTACT_444027], which is fully licensed by [CONTACT_580923]. The Laboratories Unit of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene licenses laboratories and is responsible for ensuring federal c ertification of all laboratories 
located in Maryland, including federal certification in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 Program, required for all clinical laboratory testing sites used in analysis of samples from US patients.  WBC and ANC counts are 
calculated by [CONTACT_672463] .  
• WBC and ANC at the Nigeria site will be performed in the well -equipped FNPHY 
Medical Laboratory using the Beckman Coulter ( 3 to 5 part differential) for automated 
counts with use of a microscope for manual WBC backup, under the direct oversight of [CONTACT_672494], Head Medical Lab Technician. This laboratory routinely performs CBCs, is registered by [CONTACT_672464], the body for 
registration of diagnostic labs in Nigeria, and will abide by [CONTACT_672465].  
• WBC and ANC cutoff and reference criteria used for safety monitoring for clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672369], so using different laboratories for these measurements are not of concern.  
• If morning neutropenia occurs the afternoon (12- 4pm) draw time is acceptable. The 
draw time will be documented.  
 
Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672370]:  
Venous blood samples will be drawn to measure clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672371] (Day 14), or more often if needed during titration for clinical purposes, monthly during 
the 6- month clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672372], and at t he conclusion of the study. Levels will be 
obtained prior to the administration of the morning dose of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Samples will be 
analyzed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_522236] 
(clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], norclozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) are sent out to LabC orp at the MPRC and Howard University site. 
At the MPRC these may also be sent to Saladax Biomedical, Inc, Bethlehem PA  for 
immunoassay . HPLC equipment is budgeted for the Nigerian site so that all laboratory tests 
are done in the same lab to ensure standardization and QC. The purpose of the blood levels 
are 1) to ensure clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672373] 2) examine relationship of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672374].  Lab values that are considered to be abnormal may be repeated to verify 
accuracy.  A corresponding c api[INVESTIGATOR_672375], approximately week 4 and 8 
to confirm it matches venous blood levels.  This is optional and only offered at MPRC s ite 
with capi[INVESTIGATOR_156627].  
 Other Laboratory and Metabolic Monitoring:   
A chemistry panel (liver enzymes, BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, thyroid), and metabolic 
profile (lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], fasting blood glucose) will be drawn at baseline and repeated monthly. All 
laboratory values outside normal ranges will be discussed and addressed with the medically accountable physician and clinical team at each site.  A determination of 
Page 9 of 28 
 appropriate diagnostic procedures and/or follow up treatment will be made by [CONTACT_672466].  Lab values that are considered to be abnormal may be repeated to verify accu racy. We also will be collecting existing lab values if possible and will request 
only with patient permission for previous records.   Cytokines labs will be drawn prior to the 
start of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and at the middle and endpoint of the clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_240963].  
 
INFECTION MONITORING:  
 
• Body temperature will be taken at each visit. Since clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672376] [ADDRESS_908747] a review of systems, and perform a physical examination on any participant that develops a fever during t he study. Because 
infection in neutropenic patients can proceed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], a close initial evaluation is necessary and the medically accountable physician will promptly evaluate the seriousness and origin of the infection. As part of the fever workup, laboratory and 
radiological tests will be performed as deemed necessary.  
• At each visit, participants will be asked about symptoms such as sore throat, mouth ulcers, flu -like symptoms, chills, rigors, arthralgia, or any other symptoms of infection. 
Participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_611886], if they develop any of these symptoms.  
• A determination on study discontinuation, antiviral, antibiotic, antifungal, or, in Nigeria, antimalarial treatment will be made with the phy sician and infectious disease consultant 
as needed. The same criteria apply to all three sites. We will also pay special attention to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672377] a blood level during an infection as clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672378] .  
 
SYMPTOM MONITORING:   
• Psychiatric symptoms will be monitored at 2  times pretreatment to establish a baseline 
(approximately 6 weeks  prior to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672361], and 1 week prior to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672379]), and 
every four weeks thereafter during the six months of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672380].  
• Decisions regarding response to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672381].  
• The following guidelines will be generally observed and recommended based on current literature:  Eight weeks is often needed for complete response and few patients demonstrate additional response after this time period. Study discontinuation from clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672382]. The treating 
physician will help make the decision.  
o Either t he treating psychiatrist, medically accountable physician, or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_672383] a patient is experiencing clinical worsening. Clinical worsening may be defined as the following: the subject is judged to be entering an exacerbation of his/her illnes s by [CONTACT_68071]; an increase of 3 or more points from 
baseline on a BPRS positive symptom item; an increase of 3 or more points from baseline on BPRS somatic concern, conceptual disorganization or hostility; or an increase of [ADDRESS_908748] be accompanied by [CONTACT_15370]’s feelings that they are entering exacerbation.  
o Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672384] a significant side effect, 
or if there is no adequate symptom response to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672385] a better option. Response is defined as 20% improvement and a final score of ≤ 35 in total BPRS score or CGI ≤ 3. These scores generally result in a response rate of approximately 68% with another 25% demonstrating partial response. Partial response is defined as < 20% improvement on total BPRS with two clinician s agreeing that there is notable improvement not evident on BPRS. 
We anticipate that 7% of patients will not achieve any response and may be discontinued at 8 weeks. Since achieving response after 8 weeks is not likely and the risks may be higher, symptoms  will be monitored monthly to determine 
whether clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672386].   
o Once a participant is discontinued from clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], for whatever reason, they may remain in the study for continued monitoring.  When any participant is discontinued from the s tudy, completion ratings and assessments (including 
laboratory tests and rating scales) will be performed if possible. If a patient is prematurely terminated from the study, the investigators will work with the clinical team to ensure the patient will cont inue clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672387].  More information on discontinuation is later in the protocol in the withdrawal criteria section.  
 
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) : Total symptoms will be measured using the total 
score on the 18 item version. Psychotic symptoms will be calculated using the conceptual disorganization, hallucinations, suspi[INVESTIGATOR_672388] (delusion) items.  
Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) : The CGI severity of illness item will be used to 
assess global changes in symptomatology.  
Calgary Depression Rating Scale (CDS) : This [ADDRESS_908749], which will be done at each visit.  
Simpson- Angus Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (SAS) : The modified 11- item version 
of the SAS will be used to assess EPS.  
Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS): This is a 12 -item scale, with 7 items 
designed to assess abnormal facial , oral, extremity, and trunk movements; 3 global 
judgment items; and 2 current dental status items.  
Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) : This is a [ADDRESS_908750] (SEC) : This scale is designed to assess vital signs and directly inquire 
about 25 commonly occurring antipsychotic side effects. Specifically, it covers side effects 
seen with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], side effects that relate to infection (i.e., sore throat, gum soreness, cold, pneumonia) and other common side effects.  We will provide anticonstipation 
medications and other side effect medications as needed.  
 
 GENOTYPI[INVESTIGATOR_672389]:  
 
o Single -Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_672390] (Qiagen) using TaqMan polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) technology.  
o We will use a validated commercially available 5' ->3' exonuclease assay; Assay IDs; 
(C__15769614_10) and (C__2493442_10) for determining the genotype at the Duf fy 
variant (rs2814778) and missense mutation (rs12075) of DARC gene.  
o We will use the context sequence of genomic regions for the SNPs extracted from the 
GWAS study of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]- induced agranulocytosis to design forward and reverse 
primers and design customized assays for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_672391]- induced agranulocytosis in the CIAG study. 
Customized genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_672392], rs41549217 and rs13073300, for HLA -B and HHLA2 genes,  respectively, and SNPs rs143211074 and 
rs28362679 of BTNL2  gene. All PCR will be performed in [CONTACT_672495]’s Biogenetics Lab, 
on standard 96- well reaction plates, as previously described. For each PCR reaction, 2 
ng of genomic DNA will be used in a 5- μl reaction mixture (1.3 mM MgCl2, 200 μM 
dNTP mix, 0.25 μM of each primer, 5% DMSO, 1.5 U Taq polymerase). The PCR 
program includes: denaturation of DNA (5 min at 94°C), 30 cycles of 30s at 94°C, 30s at 
62°C, and 30s at 72°C.  This will be followed by a final  extension of 10 min at 72°C.   
o All PCR reactions will be performed using the Biorad Multiplatform Thermocycler, which 
has 4 blocks of 384 wells (Bio- Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, [LOCATION_003]). PCR results 
will be read by [CONTACT_672467] (Vic/Fam)  and allelic discrimination analysis 
with 7900 Sequence Detection Systems (SDS) software v2.3 (Applied Biosystems) to assign genotype groups to the SNPs. The TaqMan genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_672393].  
o The DNA will be shipped from Nigeria to the MPRC using either Oragene DNA kits or Whatman FTA Elute Micro Cards. DNA is relatively stable and currently DNA is being shipped on other collaborative grants without problems.  
  
CLOZAPI[INVESTIGATOR_672394]:    
o Following consent and prior to initiation of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , eligible patients will have weekly 
WBC/ANC. During this period, patients will be registered with the clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672395]. Patients may be 
inpati ents or outpatients.  
o Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672396] (other regimens permitted). 
The dose will be titrated within a range of 200 -900 mg daily. We do permit  individualized 
dosing, as occurrence of neutropenia and agranulocytosis is not clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672397]- related.

  The white blood cell count level is not related to the dose of the medication. The dose throughout the study will not be altered based on white blood cell counts, but if the white blood cell counts fall lower than the established monitoring parameters for each patient the patient may be discontinued from treatment.  
  
 MONITORING GUIDELINES:  
 
Participants enrolled in the study at all 3 sites will receive the modified guidelines (table below ) 
in addition to their informed consent and the investigator and pati ent will sign the consent 
acknowledging the modified guidelines. More stringent monitoring may take place if ANC levels fluctuate and modifications from this guideline may occur on a case by [CONTACT_672468] a physician, hematologist and PI. During the study subjects will be very 
closely monitored as per below. Subjects will be educated concerning signs and symptoms of infection and the need to immediately report these throughout the study.  
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the modified moni toring procedures 
under an IND:

Changes can be made with consultation from hematology. Always consider other 
medications that may be contributing to ANC suppression.  
Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672401]  1. All patients initiating clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672402] <2500/mm3 in the past 
[ADDRESS_908755] a history of ANC<500/mm3. 
2. Patients with two baseline ANC levels ≥1000/mm3 will be initiated with weekly b lood 
draws.  
3. Patients with baseline ANC levels between 500 -999/mm3 may be initiated  
a. After hematology consult and  
b. With specific oversight plan approved by [CONTACT_672469].  
c. If initiated, patients will have ANC drawn twice weekly for first month of  
treatment prior to be considered for weekly monitoring.  If ANC levels fall 
below 500/mm3, treatment will be interrupted as per protocol below .   
d. Justification for deviation from Risk Evaluation Management System (REMS) 
recommendations:  We recognize that  these are more lenient criteria than 
REMS, however, patients are enrolled in clinical trial with increased monitoring and we will be seeking a hematology consult and oversight prior 
to initiation and to make a plan for increased monitoring once treatment 
initiated.

5. Must contact [CONTACT_672471]:  
a. Discontinue treatment is likely and most probable but will noti fy and 
consult hematologyand make decision prior to discontinuation for 
<500/mm3 and no fever.  
b. Possible Plan of Action with Consultation from Hematology and FDA:  
i. Daily ANC until ANC >500/mm3 
ii. Twice weekly CBC until ANC >1000/mm3  
iii. Complete full history looking for signs and symptoms of infection.  
iv. Subjects will continue with daily monitoring for fever.  
v. If temp increases to > 38.5° C, the subject will be directed to the 
Emergency Department or arranged for admission. If subject 
remains < 500 /mm3, they may be admitted and covered with 
antibiotics for neutropenic fever according to institutional 
standards. Work -up may include blood cultures, urine cultures 
and chest x -ray as well as work -up for localizing symptoms if they 
exist.  
vi. Once ANC increases to >500/mm3, antibiotics may be 
discontinued if no source of infection is identified.  
vii. For subjects with recurrent, persistent fever after 48 hours of 
antibiotics, infectious disease consultation may be requested  
viii. Only with compelling clinical circumstances should you consider 
starting granulocyte colony stimulating factors. In this case either 
filgrastim daily at 480 mcg subcutaneously (SQ) daily until ANC is 
>1000 /mm3 or a single dose of pegfilgrastim [ADDRESS_908756] by [CONTACT_6292] a research nurse. 
Growth factor use can be associated with fever so use only if 
directed by [CONTACT_672472].  
ix. For all subjects whose ANC does not increase above 500 /mm3 
[ADDRESS_908757] dose of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672404], there may be consideration of bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752].  
6. If a participant falls below 500/mm
3 he/she will likely be discontinued from the st udy. 
In this case, the research team will contact [CONTACT_672473], however the 
participant will not continue to with study visits and assessments. Only if a 
participant is seen by [CONTACT_648727], admitted for infection symptoms or receives filgrastim 
or pegfilgrstim this will be documented as a serious adverse event (SAE) and 
information sent to all regulatory bodies.  
7. If participant is rechallenged with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], resume treatment as a new patient 
monitoring level once ANC ≥1000/mm3 or at least patient’s known baseline.

 A patient version to give out at time of consent is included at the end of the protocol.  
 
The FDA has given us advice to try less conservative monitoring guidelines after we initially treat participants in the study and gain more experience. The following will be considered for a modification  but only used once amended to the IRB : 
1. ANC 1000 -1499 /mm
3 :monitor weekly for 6 months and then every two weeks for 6 
months, then monthly  
2. ANC 500 -999 /mm3 :hematology consult, continue clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], monitor 3x weekly  until ≥ 
1000/mm3 then weekly for weeks then back to baseline monitoring  
3. ANC <500/mm3  :stop clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , hematology consult, monitor daily until ≥  500 /mm3, 
then 3x weekly until back to baseline, do not rechallenge unless benefit outweighs risk.  
 In the US [CONTACT_672496] from Johns Hopkins University will be the hematologist and 
consultant hematologist to Nigeria. [CONTACT_672497], the Nigerian consultant hematologist from Lagos University Teaching Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (LUTH) will be on the protocol in Nigeria. In the case of Pharmacy and 
General Overall 
Guidelines  1. All US participants will be registered the clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672405].  
2. US participants will be registered as BEN patients and, if necessary, the REMS 
program will be apprised of modified guidelines.  
3. Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672406] a seven day supply, so long as the ANC is at least 
1000 to coincide with recommended blood draws. For patients whose ANC is > 
500/mm3 and < 1000/mm3, medications may be dispensed as a three or four day supply 
based on appointment dates or as indicated  below*.  
4. If clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672407], participants will be contact[CONTACT_672474] a follow -up visit.  
5. A centralized research designee (clinical pharmacist) will coordinate with the 
dispensing pharmacy (if different than centralized) and physician involved with 
participant to ensure PDA is available where needed (outpatients) or that eligibility 
criteria is provided (inpatients).   The centralized research designee clinical pharmacist 
shall act as designee for pre- identified prescribers working in the study.  Per these 
guidelines, after physician review and approval, these specialized designees shall enroll 
patients and enter ANC levels for the study.   
a. Justification for this deviation from REMS guide:  All treatment decisions 
will be made by [CONTACT_672475].  Our specially trained clinical pharmacist is part of the 
clinical research team with advanced expertise in treating BEN patients 
with c lozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672408].   
Other Information  *daily, weekly or twice weekly blood draw and dispensing (particularly in the 
range of <500- <1000 /mm3) will be determined based on additional 
recommendations from the FDA, REMS implementation or based on individual 
patient parameters. Patients that remain between 500- 1000/mm3 for longer than 
4 weeks may be recommended for weekly clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672409]. Also going from tw ice weekly to weekly monitoring should occur after 
4 values are back above 1000 cells/ mm3      Emergency supply of two doses is given 
to all patients.

 severe Neut ropenia, one strategy to increase ANC values is to start lithium treatment, however 
we will not recommend this strategy.  
  
Concomitant Medications:   
Subjects may remain on adjunctive anticholinergic, antidepressant, most mood stabilizers 
and/or antianxiety  agents. Subjects on such medications are included to increase the 
generalizability of study results and to relate the study more closely to treatment issues 
addressed in usual clinical practice. Any medication that may lower WBCs such as carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_672410] l not be permitted to be initiated but treatment for [ADDRESS_908758] Recruitment: Subjects will be recruited from three sites. The MPRC will be 
coordinating the study.  [CONTACT_672498], the primary coinvestigator affiliated with  MPRC, 
along with Dr.Lawal from FNPHY, will oversee study procedures and recruitment from the Nigerian site and [CONTACT_672499] will be the primary coinvestigator for the Howard University 
Site. All sites will have approval by [CONTACT_3551] (IRB), however UMB will be 
the central IRB of record. We plan to enroll at least [ADDRESS_908759] possible 
BEN (past neutropenia) from the three sites, with approximately 130 subjects from Nigeria 
(easy to recruit with pure DARC -/- population), [ADDRESS_908760] University, al l fewer than the 
amount of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672411].   
A partial HIPPA waiver will be obtained to permit the identification of potential 
participants through chart review. In addition, participants will be referred by [CONTACT_108443]’s treatment t eam for consideration of study participation.  A chart review will be completed for all 
potential participants to reduce the likelihood that they will be found ineligible after participating in more extensive assessments. The study recruiter will verify wi th the primary clinician that a 
potential participant is sufficiently stabilized to consider participation and has capacity to provide consent. This is done prior to the study recruiter approaching a potential participant. The study recruiter will be introduced to the person and provide a brief overview of the project.   
Participants may also be recruited from internet based advertising (HP -00061828) that 
will refer interested participants to the MPRC web site as well as working with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672412] f rom the state of Maryland identified through collaboration with the Behavioral 
Health Administration and Medicaid.  
We will also collect data on WBC, ANC and demographic information on people 
previously treated in Maryland on a waiver system. Their data is available in clinical charts at Spring Grove Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_672413].  These patients will not be eligible to reenroll in this study but the data will be available to add to the study as it will help decrease the final sample size needed 
to enroll in the study. We will link this data from another study approval where a waiver of informed consent has been granted to study antipsychotic use (HP -00040084).  
 PRIMARY OUTCOME VARIABLES : 
 The primary outcomes are to measure ANC levels, side effects and patient safety.  
 STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
 
Page [ADDRESS_908761] of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672414]:   We will characterize variation of 
WBC and ANC levels in participants by [CONTACT_672476].  We anticipate 212+ AA 
participants with BEN who are homozygous for the DARC  null allele who will be the focus of 
this analysis , with other participants with BEN to be examined in a separate analysis . We will 
compute within -patient means and standard dev iations of weekly WBC and ANC by [CONTACT_672477], starting with the three- month pre- treatment phase, and continuing for the six 
-months of follow -up on clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_99646], and observe the frequency of ANC values 
observed that exceed specific levels  of concern (e.g. <500, <700, <1000 cells/mm3).  We will 
estimate the change from baseline in overall average WBC and ANC during each three month 
interval after initiation of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and assess whether these change with time using a mixed 
model for repe ated measures ANCOVA, controlling for baseline.  Frequency of other events of 
concern (serious infection, need for treatment for very low ANC) will also be reported. We will 
also perform analyses of effects of mean participant pre- treatment ANC, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672415]<500 cells /mm3 
during clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_99646], using linear and logistic regression. To date all published work and 
US guidelines are based on non- BEN samples and not specific to schizophrenia patients.  
 For the study when we report the results we will evaluate a subgroup of people with a history of ANC < 1500 cells/mm

 Risk of Agranulocytosis -  Analysis and Power:  The analysis of this aim  will resemble that 
for an equivalence trial comparing effectiveness of two treatments, only instead we will be comparing safety outcomes between two populations (patients with and without BEN), using an extremely large historic control group rather than n ewly recruited controls. We will compare 
estimated risk of agranulocytosis in our study to a large historic cohort study estimating risk of agranulocytosis in non -BEN patients followed according to current FDA guidelines during 
clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_99646]. In a report on 11,555 clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]- treated patients followed for 
agranulocytosis . There is an incidence rate of 0.9% at one year (upper 95% CI 0.99), with over 
80% of cases observed within the first three months, from which we conclude that our planned six-month fol low-up on clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672416].  Some 
participants will discontinue clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672417] -month treatment phase.  In 
the CATIE trial, 15% of participants assigned to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672418]. To adjust for missing data due to dropout, we will use the Kaplan- Meier method for 
censored survival data to calculate a point estimate of the proportion of cases of agranulocytosis by [CONTACT_157515]. However, we anticipate few if any cases of agranulocytosis in our cohort, so that usual methods of calculating a CI for the percent without an event at six months which rely on large sample estimators may not work well.  Accordingly, we will also use all clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]- treated cases, ignoring variation in follow -up on clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], to calculate a 
binomial approximation for an upper 95% confidence limit for the risk, r, of agranulocytosis during the first six -months on by [CONTACT_672478] 0.95= 1 -  Σ
j n!/(j!(n -j)!) rj(1-r)n-j, where r is 
probability (r isk) of agranulocytosis, n is the total number of participants, k is the number of 
cases of agranulocytosis, and the summation runs from j=0 to k.  If no cases are observed, this 
reduces to 0.05 =(1- r)n  ; we will use similar a similar formula  to calculate the lower confidence 
limit (LCL); if the LCL does not include the risk level in the historic control cohort, we would 
reject strict equivalence of risk.  With n=212 DARC null homozygous participants, zero cases 
observed would give an upper limit on the ri sk of 1.4%, approximately 1.4 x the estimated risk 
of agranulocytosis in non- BEN patients reported in a U.S. cohort of 11,555 patients treated 
with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Thus, we will not be able to demonstrate complete equivalence to the risk of 
Page 19 of 28 
 clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672419]- BEN patients, but can limit the excess risk to a level potentially acceptable to 
justify gaining further clinical experience with use in BEN patients.   
 
Safety Monitoring:   If the risk of agranulocytosis in participants with BEN is much higher than 
the risk  in non- BEN subjects treated with usual monitoring guidelines in the US, then the 
potential for fatal harm may be unacceptably high.  While our best risk estimate will not be 
obtained until the end of the study, the appearance of any agranulocytosis cases will set a 
lower limit on the final point estimate of the level of risk.  For example, if two agranulocytosis cases are observed in the first 50 participants, the current point estimate for risk of agranulocytosis after the 2
nd case would be 2/50 = 4%, and the final risk estimate if the study 
continued to the full sample size of 250 with no dropouts, the risk cannot be less than 2/250 = 0.8%.  We will notify the DSMB monitoring the study whenever a case of agranulocytosis 
occurs, along with data on fluctuat ions in WBC/ANC preceding the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the current 
estimate of risk, the upper and lower bound on the ultimate risk estimate if the study continued 
with no further cases.   In practice, we assume some dropouts will occur.  Assuming six month 
follow- up on a  final n of 212 participants (15% dropout), after withdrawals for causes other than 
agranulocytosis, we calculated exact two- sided confidence limits on the risk (probability) of 
agranulocytosis using the Clopper -Pearson formula, for numbers of cases of agr anulocytosis 
ranging from 1 to 10.  The results are shown in Table 1 below  
 
Table 1: Point estimate of agranulocytosis risk (p) and 95% confidence limits

The DSMB will review data on the accumulated cases to recommend whether to terminate the 
study, modify the ANC monitoring guidelines or take other action, if these es timates suggest 
that, based on observed cases to date and expected final sample size, the anticipated lower bound on risk of agranulocytosis at end of study will be unacceptably high.   
 
 An exploratory study of fluctuations in WBC and ANC  in clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]- treated African descent  
participants meeting ANC criteria for BEN who are not DARC  null homozygotes  will use 
statistical methods similar above .  In addition, we will review patient characteristics and 
medical history to determine any identifiable causes of epi[INVESTIGATOR_672420], to further describe this subgroup of potentially heterogeneous origins.  While 
Page 20 of 28 
 underpowered to obtain definitive results, this substudy will provide valuable initial data to 
characterize this subgroup and the pot ential risks and benefits of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] .   
 
 An exploratory study of HLA alleles associated with agranulocytosis will provide 
descriptive data on the percentages (plus or minus 95% CI) of these HLA  alleles ( HLA-B and 
HHLA2)  in participants with BEN by [CONTACT_672480][INVESTIGATOR_672421].  
  RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS:  
 
i. Risks related to study medication (Therapeutic Risk). This study involves the treatment with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
 Other than neutropenia (see below), the main risks to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672422]:  salivary hypersecretion, somnolence, weight increase, dizziness, constipation, nausea, vomitin g, dyspepsia, tachycardia, hypotension, type II diabetes, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], sweating, and 
dry mouth. Serious but rare side effects include:  seizures, myocarditis, sudden death, tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, pulmonary embolism, hepatiti s, fever, intestinal 
blockage, respi[INVESTIGATOR_210529].  We will be closely monitoring weekly for side effects at all sites and will have standardized operating procedures across sites for close monitoring standards. Standard routine medical care wi ll be given for all side effect occurrences. The only 
treatments not permitted are those that may lead to a risk of neutropenia. No benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_672423] 3 days of dose titration of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
 
ii. Risk of neutropenia or infectio n (Side Effect Risk)  
 
The major risks of the study are the risk for infection and neutropenia. Based on all existing data, genetic testing, use in chemotherapy trials and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_672424], we don’t expect subject ANC levels to drop below 700 cells/mm
3, however, a number of patients may fluctuate 
below 1000 cells/mm3 throughout the study. We are paying careful attention to the risk of 
infection and neutropenia. As listed in the methods we have a careful plan for ANC and infection monitoring. In rare ins tances a bone marrow biopsy or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_672425].  
 iii. Risk related to participating in research interviews (Research Risk)  
 
The risk from research interviews is minimal and relatively uncommon. During assessments participants may be uncomfortable discussing their smoking habits or mental health history 
and treatments. Participants may become frustrated and tense when they encounter difficulty 
when completing these measures. Careful planning and observation of the participant's 
response to these sessions  will allow the testing to be completed with a minimum of 
discomfort. Participants will take breaks when necessary to help alleviate any discomfort. All 
interviewers are trained to recognize signs of distress or anxiety. The participant will be reminded that they can refuse to answer any question that makes them uncomfortable and may take breaks whenever they are needed.  There is a slight risk of breach of confidentiality . 
All data will be coded with an ID number that is unique. All data including informati on from 
chart reviews, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_672426]. Only members 
Page [ADDRESS_908762] access to the link between the ID and participant’s name. Data 
containing names and personal information will never be incl uded in published materials.   
 iv. Other risks.  
 
Blood draws may be associated with tenderness or bruising. A cream can be used to reduce 
the pain or discomfort from inserting the needle. The cream itself may cause the skin to 
become pale, red, or swollen. Inserting the needle may cause dizziness or fainting. Infection is 
rare, because sterile methods are used. The total amount of blood taken during the study is 
about half of the blood taken in one blood donation. This amount of blood is usually replaced 
by [CONTACT_3433] e body without any problems. A rash could appear at the site of the EKG pads.  
 
 CONFIDENTIALITY AND PROTECTIONS AGAINST RISK:  
 Protections against Therapeutic and Research Risk  
We will make every attempt to minimize all study -related risks. Women of childbearing age will 
agree to the use of medically approved birth control, which includes condoms, oral contraceptives, diaphragms and intrauterine device during the study. Pregnant and lactating females will be excluded. We will test for pregnancy prior to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672427]. We will be carefully monitoring for side effects and psychiatric symptoms with 
around the clock psychiatric and medical coverage.  A physician and coordinator will be 
reachable 24 hours daily.  
 
Confidentiality:  
 Careful procedures will be used to protect the anonymity of the participants and the 
confidentiality of the data.  Names will only appear on consent forms and on a master list  that 
links them with study ID numbers (different from medical record numbers). This list will be stored in locked files in a separate location from the data.  At the conclusion of the project, the 
list will be destroyed, unless continuation is planned and approved by [CONTACT_1636]. All data (whether on forms or electronic data files) will be collected, analyzed, and reported according to the study ID number and will contain no names or other identifiers.  Raw 
paper -based data will be stored in locked files.  Electronic data files reside on desktop 
computers and are password protected. Sources of identifiable research materials obtained 
from participants include laboratory (blood) specimens, research records and ratings and computerized data. Laboratory specimens and ratings will be obtained for research purposes; however close monitoring of laboratory measures will ensure excellent monitoring for clinical treatment. This will allow clinical treatment for new onset lipid or glucose abnormalities , should 
they occur. Any existing data and records will be used if possible.  
 
The Database and Biostatistics Core at the MPRC will prepare laptops  to be used for the study at each site. To protect participant confidentiality, data stored on this system w ill be kept 
in password protected and encrypted files and the study laptop will be stored in a locked cabinet in the FNPHY Biological Psychiatry Research Suite and a locked research suite at Howard University. Only members of the FNPHY and HU research team s have access to the 
research suite and cabinets. The MPRC IT/database administration staff created a secure File Transfer Protocol (FTP) link for the transfer of encrypted data from FNPHY and HU to the MPRC server. This will be installed on the FNPHY and HU study laptops. At frequent, regular intervals, the encrypted database will be backed up to the MPRC secure server overnight at 
Page [ADDRESS_908763] University and Nigeria when there is less Internet traffic. Additionally, as determined 
by [CONTACT_672481], duplicate files of this encrypted database will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_672428] (e.g., FedEx) to the MPRC site or brought back in person to update the combined study database and the mirror of the database on the back -up 
laptop. W e also have a secure fax line with direct electronic data dumpi[INVESTIGATOR_672429].  MPRC staff will run regular queries on the files 
from both sites to identify records with potential data entry or other problems.  This dual method 
of transmitting data between sites was chosen because of uncertainties about the regular availability of high -speed internet -based modes of data transmission (e.g., FTP) at the Nigerian 
site. This method has worked well as part of the existing NIMH -funded study between MPRC 
and FNPHY.  
 
Informed Consent.   
Research staff members are trained to recognize symptoms of severe mental illness 
and cognitive impairment that could undermine an individual's ability to provide informed consent. Interested pe ople will be provided study information and an informed consent form 
that contains all pertinent details of participation and includes the following: a brief explanation of the purpose of the research and a brief explanation of the requirements of the part icipant, 
including: a) willingness to be treated with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], b) completing a series of interviews about one’s symptoms, c) completing assessment tasks, and d) being available for follow -up 
assessments.  
 The consent form will include an explanation of the risks and benefits of participation; assurances of confidentiality; and an explanation that participation is entirely voluntary, the decision to participate will in no way influence or restrict the participants access to clinical services and care at p articipating sites, and the participant is free to withdraw at any time with 
no negative consequences. As some potential participants will have poor reading skills, the consent form will be read aloud to all participants in tandem with their own silent reading of the document. The individual securing consent will review any points about which the participant is unclear, and the participant will be invited to ask questions as needed.  
 After reading the consent, and before obtaining a signature, a brief ques tionnaire is 
administered to verify that the participant is competent to provide consent and has demonstrated comprehension of the consent document. This questionnaire is attached to the informed consent form and is completed immediately after explaining t he informed consent 
form and before obtaining the participant's signature [CONTACT_25084]. If the participant does not understand the consent form, the recruiter will try to explain points of confusion, and administer the questionnaire again. Those failing to answer the questions adequately will not be recruited into the study. The recruiter will also make a clinical judgment and not recruit participants who 
appear unable to grasp key aspects of the procedure. This approach, which requires a proactive demonstration on the part of the participant that they understand what is being requested, has been used by [CONTACT_672482]. Included participants must also be judged competent to consent by [CONTACT_426466] (ESC) questionnaire, and provide voluntary informed consent.  Per University of Maryland School of Medicine IRB 
regulations, a copy of the signed consent form is given to the participant, a copy is placed in the person's medical record, and the original is kept in the laboratory.   Informed consent forms will include consent to share de- identified subject data with a clinical 
trial data repository maintained by [CONTACT_17144], using procedures 
Page 23 of 28 
 outlined in NIH NOT -MH-14-015 (http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice- files/NOT -MH-14-
015.html ).  This depository will allow other researchers access to data from this clinical trial, 
with the assuranc e that the participant's individual name [CONTACT_672493].  
 
WBC and infection monitoring:  
All subjects in the study will be evaluated weekly during clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672430]. The team will closely examine any risk of severe neutropenia or infection. Twice 
weekly monitoring will be instituted in most cases when ANC drops below 12 00 cells/mm3. The 
full procedure for WBC monitoring is in the protocol. In addition to monit oring by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_672431], a expert hematology consultants are available to the research teams  as 
well as the hematology team from the FDA at their request . Weekly temperatures will be taken 
and signs and symptoms of infection will be closely m onitored.   
 
We will notify the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) monitoring the study whenever a case of agranulocytosis occurs. The DSMB will review data on the accumulated cases to recommend whether to terminate the study, modify the ANC monitoring guidelines or take 
other action.  If cases of agranulocytosis occur, the DSMB will review, based on the number of 
observed cases and the projected total sample size, whether the final estimated risk of 
agranulocytosis from this study in BEN subjects treated w ith clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672432].  
 
Monitoring of adequate psychiatric symptom response:   
Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672433] a significant side effect, or if 
there is no adequate symptom response to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672434] a better option. Response is defined as 20% improvement in total BPRS Score and a final score of ≤ 35 or CGI ≤ 3. These generally result in a response rate of approximately 68% with another 25% demonstrating partial response. Partial response is defined as < 20% on total BPRS with two clinicians agreeing that there is notable improv ement not evident on BPRS. We 
anticipate that 7% of patients will not achieve any response and may be discontinued at 8 weeks due to incomplete response. Since response after 8 weeks is not likely and the risks may be higher, symptoms will be monitored monthly to determine whether clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672386].   
 Once a participant is discontinued from the study for whatever reason, completion 
ratings will be performed if possible. These include laboratory tests and clinical rating scales. If a patient is prematurely terminated from the study, the investigators will work with the clinical team to ensure the patient will resume other antipsychotic treatments for their symptoms.   
 
Suicidality:  
Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672435]. Suicidality may be increased in participants with treatment resistant symptoms. Based on these considerations, we will use the Calgary Depression Rating Scale (CDS) to monitor for presence of significant suicidality during screening and active treatment with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. If any participant has a score on the suicidal item greater than 0 they will be evaluated. If moderate suicidal ideation or intent is observed during screening, the participant 
will be offered the opport unity to try immediate clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_99646], and a “suicide prevention 
plan” will be implemented to provide appropriate additional behavioral interventions. This may 
Page 24 of 28 
 also include dosage adjustment or increase.  If serious suicidal ideation or intent is obser ved 
during clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_99646], the “suicide prevention plan” will be implemented immediately and 
if patients do not respond to a dose increase or other treatments, they will be discontinued 
from study.  The “suicide prevention plan” consists of immediate psychiatric evaluation, 
implementation of  a suicide prevention plan, provision of [ADDRESS_908764] successfully used to minimize the potential distress for participants include: informing participants before the interviews about the topi[INVESTIGATOR_672436]; reminding part icipants that they may choose not to answer certain questions, or to 
terminate the interview at any time; and taking breaks during the interview when the participant feels tense or distressed. Interviewers will be trained in the recognition of, and appropr iate 
response to (including the involvement of other professionals), specific kinds of participant negative responses.   
 
Certification on Protection of Human Subjects in Research:   
All research staff participating in this study at all three sites are requi red to undergo the 
online Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Course on Human Subjects Research. Their certificates of completion are uploaded (as research staff) in the University of Maryland Baltimore IRB -approved study protocol in CIC ERO (Collaborative Institutional Comprehensive 
Evaluation of Research Online) –  the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Research 
Evaluation Portal and are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) .  
 
Federal Cer tificate of Confidentiality:  
 We will be obtaining a Federal Certificate of Confidentiality in the US. This is not required 
for Nigeria.  
 
Collaborative Protocol and Consent Form Approval :  
The University of Maryland Baltimore IRB -approved study protocol a nd consent form 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_672483][INVESTIGATOR_672336], Lagos and the Howard University IRB. Any significant changes requested by [CONTACT_672484] -presented to the UMB  IRB. At the Nigerian 
site, these documents would bear the seal of the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_672437]. Howard University will also have their consent form s. Furthermore, the UMB IRB -approved 
consent forms will be translated into two indigenous Nigerian languages by a team of linguistic experts and back -translated to English by [CONTACT_672485]. Thus, 
consent forms at FNPHY will be available in English, Yoruba, and Igbo at the Nigerian site.  
 
Treatment:   
We have developed a slow and standardized dosing titration to protect against side 
effects and promote tolerability. This titration is consistent with that approved by [CONTACT_672486].  
 
Page 25 of 28 
 Medication Adherence:  
Patients receiving >75% of their assigned medication will be considered adherent.  
Outpatient adherence will be monitored through weekly pi[INVESTIGATOR_672438]. 
Medications will be dispensed on a weekly basis and will only be dispensed after adherence is assessed and all other assessments are completed. Inpatient adherence will be monitored through inpatient medication records. If a patient is observed to have an adherence problem, this will be discussed with the patient and a plan formulated to bring the patient back into adherence. These monitoring procedures have been used in other MPRC studies and have resulted in high levels of adherence (~90%). Non- adherence (not receiving >25% assigned 
study medication) will be reason for termination from the study. Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672439]- titration. If this happens more than once the 
participant will be discontinued from the study but may continue to take clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672440].  
 
Development of New Onset Diabetes and Hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]:   
If a participant develops new onset diabetes and/or hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_672441], a 
consult will be called b y the treating physician, and the participant will receive treatment 
according to the current guidelines.  
 
Withdrawal Criteria:  
 We have criteria for discontinuation of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672442]. 
Participants can stop study drug and continue in the monitoring portion of the study.  
 
A. Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672443] (clinician and PI [INVESTIGATOR_672444], following are potential causes of discontinuation).  
 
Symptom Worsening:   
             Either the treating psychiatrist, medically accou ntable physician, or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_672383] a patient is experiencing clinical worsening. Clinical worsening may be defined as the following: the subject is judged to be entering an exacerbation of his/her illness by [CONTACT_68071]; an increase of 3 or more points from baseline on a BPRS positive symptom item; an increase of 3 or more points from baseline on BPRS somatic concern, conceptual disorganization or hostility; or an increase of [ADDRESS_908765] be accompanied by [CONTACT_15370]’s feelings that they are entering exacerbation.  
 No symptom Improvem ent

defined as 20% improvement and a final score of ≤ 35 in total BPRS score or CGI ≤ 3. These scores generally result in a response rate of approximately 68% with another 25% demonstrating partial response. We anticipate that 7% of patients may not achieve any response (partial or full) and may be discontinued.  
 
Low White Blood Cell Count  
             If a participant drops below 500 cells/mm
3 (with stat redraw for confirmation) than 
clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672446]. Participants may be discontinued due to a rapid falling white blood cell count if the hematologist or PI [INVESTIGATOR_672447] a higher level.

this happens more than once as no nadherence the participant may be discontinued from 
clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672448]-adherent to Study Procedures  
                If the participant is nonadherent to white blood cell monitoring, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672449].  
 
Once a participant is discontinued from cloz api[INVESTIGATOR_050], for whatever reason, they may remain in the 
study for continued monitoring.  
  
B. Discontinuation from Study and all Monitoring:  
 
• All attempts, as long as participant agrees, to follow -up monitoring when clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672450]  
• Discontinuation from the study will occur if the participant is not adherent to study  
          procedures and blood draws or if t he participant no longer wants to be enrolled or  
          the physician determines blood draws and/or study participation are not in the  
          best interest of the patient  
• If a patient is discontinued from open label clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672451],  
         they will continue as usual for the follow -up lab work, symptom ratings and  
         clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672354]  
• If the patient is recommended for clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672452].  
• If the participant is discontinuing clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672453] a plan for followed medication treatment in order to help with  
         the appropriate titration of a new medication. This will be done clinically with no  
         research protocol for cross titration and other medication treatment.  
• If the participant is discontinuing clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672454]  
• When any participant is terminated from the study altogether, the study team will  
        schedule with the participant as soon as possible to complete ratings and          assessments (including laboratory tests and rating scales). This may result in a  
        midweek visit. The participant will be compensated for any study visit time.  
 • If a participant is discontinued from clozapi [INVESTIGATOR_672455], if they agree, to  
        continue the follow -up monitoring for the entire 6 month treatment period.  
• If a participant if nonadherent with blood work during clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672456] d ata collection will occur past the final assessments.

 BENEFITS:  
 
By [CONTACT_444039] a closely observed treatment trial with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], the patient may have improvement in variety of symptom domains. In addition, we may gain understanding of the hematologic fluctuations with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672457]. Patients treated with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672458] a treatment in the past due to their lower ANC. This provides a unique opportunity 
to have an otherwise denied clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_240963].  
 There are several other potential benefits to participating in the study. Patients in the study will 
receive many elements of treatment commonly received by [CONTACT_672488] a heavier emphasis on continuity of clinical care and close clinical monitoring for signs 
of exacerbation. By [CONTACT_444040] a combined clinical/research endeavor, they will receive more attention than is ordinarily given as part of standard clinical care. Their progress will be frequently and closely 
monitored from a variety of clinically relevant standpoints. In addition, patients will gain specific 
information concerning their neurological status and observations of treatment response which 
might guide their future pharmacologic treatment. Moreover, patients and their families should receive considerable education about the patient’s illness. Such knowledge can provide significant benefits by [CONTACT_672489]/her family to monitor and seek early clinical attention for future manifestations of illness.  
  
Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  The importance of the knowledge gaine d far outweighs any risks that may occur in this study. 
Patients with BEN who were never before able to have a trial of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_672459]. By [CONTACT_672490] a pretreatment comparison we 
will be a ble to test and measure the fluctuations of ANC in BEN treated patients and will 
understand the feasibility and science of incorporating genetic testing. Lastly, our data may help shape and change actual treatment guidelines and prescribing practices.  
  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
 A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is already established for monitoring studies at 
the MPRC and will be used as the central DSMB for this study. The DSMB is comprised of 
three psychiatrists (2 involved in treatment and r esearch, 1 who is a clinical practitioner), a 
pharmacist and a statistician. The psychiatrists will be experts in the clinical treatment of 
people with schizophrenia. The DSMB will be charged with the following responsibilities: 1) to 
establish a regular m eeting schedule; 2) to review the protocol; 3) to review the consent form; 
4) to monitor the occurrence of side effects/adverse events, and serious adverse events 
throughout the course of the study;  5) to review with investigators, the study data 
management system; and 6) to establish stop rules for the study as a whole. This study is scheduled for initial review by [CONTACT_73179] 4- 8-15. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_672460].   As a rule, the DSMB determines the frequency of review throughout a study based on risk, safety concerns 
and recruitment. All serious adverse events (SAEs), including new cases of agranulocytosis, 
will be reported to the DSMB, PIs, and the University of Maryland, School  of Medicine IRB. 
The PIs will receive all SAE reports within [ADDRESS_908767] 
confidentiality, data are presented in aggregate or are identified only by [CONTACT_672491].  
 
ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATION:  
 The participant may choose not  to participate in this study.  If he/she chooses not participate in 
this study, their treatment at any facility or clinic including MPRC and Spring Grove Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_672461].  Their continued care and treatment will not change if they choose not  to 
take part in this study.   
  
PARTICIPANT COMPENSATION:  
 
During the first [ADDRESS_908768] approximately 8 (or fewer) visits for screening and blood draws. During the last [ADDRESS_908769] approximately 24 visits. Participan ts will be compensated $20 per visit for their time for a total of approximately $640 
for participation in the study if they complete approximately 8 months. If any portion is completed participants will be paid only for the visits they completed. Participants will be paid by [CONTACT_672492].

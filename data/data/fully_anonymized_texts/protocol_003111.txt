Version Date 09/02/16   
Investigational Drug: I vacaftor, 150 mg PO every 12 hrs (or matching placebo)  
 
Schedule of Study Visits: The first dose of ivacaftor  will be administered at the Day 1 visit. 
Ivacaftor will be taken twice daily, with 12 hours between each dose from day 1 through the 
morning dose of day 84.  Study visits will occur at Screening ( -28 to - 1 days), Day 1, Day 28 (± 
7), Day 56 (± 7 ), Day 84 (± 7), and Follow -up (14 ± [ADDRESS_405334] dose of ivacaftor) . 
Outcome Measures:  
Safety assessments: Assessments include tests used in clinical studies to monitor the safety 
of ivacaftor  in CF, including adverse event reporting, clinical laboratory testing, physical exams, 
and spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_328298], as required, within 24hrs at maximum.  Interim safety analysis will include review 
of AEs and safety labs by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_328299]  10, 20, 
and 30 subjects.   Ocular exam will be performed at baseline unless known history of cataracts.  
PK:  PK/PD analyses between ivacaftor  levels and CFTR activity in the sweat gland will reveal 
new insights into the degree that wild- type CFTR can be activated. Calculated PK parameters 
include: area -under -the-curve (AUC 12), maximum plasma concentration (C max), time to C max 
(Tmax), oral clear ance (CL/F), terminal apparent distribution volume (V z/F), and elimination half -
life (t 1/2). Subsequently, intensive data and sparse plasma concentrations will be combined to 
create a population PK model to assess covariates, such as age, weight, sex, smok ing status, 
etc. as previously conducted by [CONTACT_328326].  
MCC: Clearance of Tc99 sulfur colloid is a measure of MCC of the lungs, and is calculated by a 
standard protocol developed by [CONTACT_328327]. The method provides a robust measure of MCC, and has been sensitive to the effects of inhaled pharmacologic agents in CF and COPD including improvements of an 
unprecedentedly large magnitude in CF patients with the G551D -CFTR mutation treated with 
ivacaftor measured in a multicenter study.  The technique allows estimates of MCC in both the 
small and large airway compartments.  
[ADDRESS_405335]:  this practical test is commonly used in the assessment of patients w ith 
COPD.  The 6MWT will be used as a measure of functional status of patients and as a 
measurement of changes in functional capacity due to the intervention.  
CFTR activity in the periphery:  Sweat chloride abnormality is correlated with COPD severity and symptoms, and is a highly sensitive outcome measure for CFTR- directed therapeutics. We 
have shown sweat chloride is sensitive to the presence of cigarette smoking and COPD, and 
the test has been successfully used as an endpoint in multiple CF trials, including studies to 
detect the efficacy of ivacaftor therapy.  
 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]:   Spi[INVESTIGATOR_65515] a standard outcome measure in COPD and a major indicator of 
efficacy and safety in COPD clinical trials. Post -bronchodilator spi[INVESTIGATOR_328300]
1, FVC, and FEF25- 75 will be calculated based on 
Hankinson prediction equations. 
 
Patient Reported Outcomes: Questionnaires designed to detect the burden of cough and 
sputum symptoms as well as overall health status will be used to monitor clinical outcome before and after study drug. This includes the San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire, 
the Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale (BCSS), the Cough and Sputum Assessment 
6 
Version Date 09/02/16  Questionnaire (CASA -Q), the COPD assessment test (CAT ), the St. George Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6004] ( SGRQ ), and the EXACT -PRO  (the latter which will be useful to track pulmonary 
exacerbations) . 
 
Biomarker collection:  Serum and plasma will be stored with and without protease inhibitors to 
allow exploratory biom arker studies to be conducted upon conclusion of the study.  We 
anticipate testing for free acrolein since we hypothesize elevated acrolein levels may be associated with CFTR dysfunction.  Acrolein will be estimated using our LC/MS/MS protocol.  
 
CFTR Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  CFTR will be sequenced by [CONTACT_328328] .  Analysis will be stratified by [CONTACT_328329].  Since we have a large pool of previously test ed 
COPD patients, we will target our enrollment to those without known CFTR mutations.  
 Statistical plan:  Safety analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_9086].  Pharmacodynamic 
analysis will be evaluated within group  for the ivacaftor treatment gro up for changes between 
screening/day 1 and day 84, in comparison to between group changes in the placebo treatment 
group.  The primary outcome measure is safety; the co -primary efficacy outcome measures  are 
MCC (AUC
60) and change in FEV1 (% predicted).  Power analysis for measurements of MCC, 
CFTR function measured by [CONTACT_328330], and FEV1 (% predicted) are provided in below .  
Secondary outcome measures including change in other measures of spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], PROs, 
exacerbation frequency, and 6MWD will also be analyzed.  The off drug effect will be measured 
by [CONTACT_328331] -up visit to assess the change from on drug to washout at the 
follow up visit.   
 
Role of Vertex IIS:  
• Vertex Pharmaceuticals will provide ivacaftor and matching placebo to randomize up to 
approximately 50 subjects to achieve approximately 40 completers ( 35 active patients 
and 15 placebo treated patients for 84  days , assuming 5  dropouts in the ivacaftor group 
and 5 dropouts in the placebo group ).  This will provide sufficient compound for lost 
samples, if they occur.  
• To facilitate PK studies planned at UAB, we also request pure ivacaftor powder and 
stable isotope labeled internal standard for assay development and validation.  We 
request 2-5 mg of each.

Version Date 09/02/16  1.0   Rationale:    
Like CF, COPD is characterized by [CONTACT_328332]. Our preliminary data indicate that cigarette smoke exerts deleterious effects on airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_328301], enhanced mucus expression, and a pronounced reduction in mucociliary transport 
(MCT)
6 Preliminary data also indicate that approximately  50% of patients with COPD have 
reduced CFTR activity, as detected in the upper airways6,[ADDRESS_405336] despi[INVESTIGATOR_328302], and can be reversed by [CONTACT_328333] (VX -770) in 
vitro by [CONTACT_328334] -type CFTR, resulting in a robust increase in MCT
6. Combined with 
unprecedented clinical improvement via augmented mucociliary clearance in CF patients with a 
responsive CFTR mutati on treated with ivacaftor9,10, these data indicate that CFTR represents a 
viable therapeutic target to address mucus stasis in a large subset of COPD patients (potentially 
representing over 4 million patients in the U.S. alone)11. This project will investigate the 
hypothesis  that ivacaftor can augment CFTR activity in individuals with COPD who exhibit 
chronic bronchitis, resulting in meaningful improvements in epi[INVESTIGATOR_328303].  Our initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_328304], demonstrated stable pharmacokinetics, and  exhibited a trend towards 
efficacy in measures of PROs and sweat chloride.[ADDRESS_405337] common adverse events reported in subjects 
receiving ivacaftor were Cough (34%) CF Pulmonary exacerbation (29%) Headache (17%) Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (16%), Nasal congestion (16%), Oropharyngeal pain (mouth 
and throat pain) (15%), Pyrexia (fever) (11%), Productive cough (10%), Nausea (10%), Rash 
(10%), and Dizziness (5%). 
 
A few subjects with CF receiving ivacaftor as well as placebo have shown signs of liver injury.  In these cases, the liver injury was noticed as abnormalities in blood tests which were monitored 
as part of the study.  The very high levels of these tests, called ALT and AST, led to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_328305], although in some cases this was placebo.  The levels of ALT and AST improved 
after Study Drug was stopped.  Very severe cases of liver injury can become permanent or be 
life-threatening, although this has not been observed with ivacaftor.   Overall, the data does not 
support an association between ivacaftor and ALT and AST elevations.  
 In programs that were designed to provide access  to ivacaftor for subjects with CF and life -
threatening severe lung disease, four deaths were reported.  In a long term, open- label

intolerance.  
 
3.0 Reproductive Risk related to ivacaftor:  
The effects of ivacaftor on the reproductive system (sperm, eggs) or the unborn child are not 
known and may be hazardous.  Birth defects, including physical deformities, mental retardation, 
and other problems, as well as premature birth are known risks of some drugs.  For this reason, 
people taking ivacaftor should not become pregnant or father a child (or donate sperm). Women 
should not breastfeed a baby [CONTACT_305350].   
 
3.1  Possible Risks of Ivacaftor Based on Animal Studies:  
 
In a study in which ivacaftor was given to newborn rats, cataracts (cloudiness of the lens of the 
eye) were seen.  No cataracts were seen in studies of older animals (rats and dogs) dosed with 
ivacaftor for longer periods of time.  No cataracts associated with ivacaftor use have been 
reported in humans in any ivacaftor studies to date.  The significance of this finding to humans is not known.  It is presently thought to only be a concern for very young individuals taking 
ivacaftor.  
 
4.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
The study is a Phase 2 Study to establish the safety and efficacy  of the CFTR potentiator 
ivacaftor in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , chronic bronchitis, and 
acquired CFTR dysfunction as detected by [CONTACT_328322] .  The design is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], 
randomized (3:1, active:placebo), double -blind, placebo- controlled study to determine the safety 
and efficacy  of ivacaftor (VX -770) in approximately 40 subjects with COPD . 
 
Enrollm ent is planned at our single center, The University of Alabama at Birmingham .  Patients 
will be randomized 3 :1 to active drug (n= 30) and placebo ( 10) to achieve the enrollment goal.  
 
• A sufficient number of subjects will be screened to randomize up to 50 subjects to 
achieve 40 completed subjects to receive either ivacaftor  150 mg BID (n= 30) or placebo 
(n=10) for 84 days.  
 
• The schedule of assessments is shown in Table 1.  The protocol design is shown in 
Figure 1. 
 
• Ivacaftor  and matching placebo wil l be orally administered as capsules according to the 
following guidelines:  
 
• Between study visit Day 1 and study visit Day 84, subjects will take 1 dose of study 
drug each day in the morning, beginning any time between 08:00 h (8:00 AM) and 
12:00 h (12:00 PM). Whenever possible, subjects should take the study drug at the 
same time each day.

6.0 Statistic al Analysis Plan  
 
Safety analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_9086].  Pharmacodynamic analysis will be 
evaluated within group for the ivacaftor treatment group for changes between screening/day 1 
and day 84.  We will also compare findings between groups .  The primary outcome measure is 
safety; the primary efficacy outcome measure is MCC (AUC 60) and change in FEV1 (% 
predicted).  Secondary outcome measures including change in other measures of spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], 
PROs, exacerbation frequency, and 6MWD will also be analyzed.  These data will be used to 
test the null hypothesis of no change using a paired t -test unless the distributions are  notably 
skewed, in which case the non- parametric Wilcoxon signed -rank test will be implemen ted. 
Between group comparisons and composite time- dependent changes based on multiple 
measures (e.g. sweat chloride, MCC, FEV1, etc.) will b e conducted as secondary  analyses 
using  the two- group t -test (or the non- parametric Wilcoxon rank -sum test if needed) and 
analysis of covariance models . The dose groups will be compared simultaneously using 
analysis of variance (or the nonparametric Kruskal -Wallis test if needed) . Longitudinal analyses 
will consist primarily of mixed models repeated measures analyses. An appropriate structure for 
the covariance matrix will be selected for these models using the final data. When a model term 
is statistically significant, the Tukey -Kramer multiple comparisons test will be used to determine 
which specific pairs of means are significantly different. Interaction terms may be included in 
some models.  All statistical tests will be two -sided and will use α=0.05 .  Power analysis for 
measure ments of MCC, CFTR function measured by [CONTACT_328330], and FEV1 (% predicted) 
are provided below . The off drug effect will be measured by [CONTACT_328331] -up visit to 
assess the change from on drug to washout at the follow up visit.

9.1 Role of Vertex IIS  regarding provision of study drug and placebo  
• Vertex Pharmaceuticals will provide ivacaftor and matching placebo to randomize up to 
approximately 50 subjects to achieve approximately 40 completers (35 active patients 
and 15 placebo treated patients for 84  days , assuming 5  dropouts in the ivacaftor group 
and 5 dropouts in the placebo group) .  This will provide sufficient compound for lost 
samples, if they occur.

15.0  Prohibited Medications and Other Restrictions  
 
In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is mainly metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4.  In vivo, ketoconazole, 
a strong CYP3A inhibitor, when co- administered with a single 150 -mg dose of Ivacaftor 
significantly inhibited the metabolism of  ivacaftor, which resulted in significantly higher systemic 
exposure of i vacaftor (AUC increased to 8.5- fold and Cmax increased to 2.7- fold), confirming 
that Ivacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate.[ADDRESS_405352] during the  study; 
the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event 
can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., including an abnormal  laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease that occurs during the study, whether or not it is  considered to be study 
drug related. This includes any newly occurring event or previous  condition that has increased 
in severity or frequency after obtaining informed consent and  assent (where applicable). Any 
abnormal findings in clinic al laboratory assessments, ECGs, vital signs, or physical examination 
that are judged by [CONTACT_328341].  Planned/elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328311].

 • Description of the event  
• Clas sification of “serious” or “not serious”  
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
• Severity (see Section 16.2 and Table 16- 1) 
• Causal relationship to study drug (see Section 16.3)  
• Action taken (see Section 16.4)  
17 
Version Date 09/02/16  • Outcome (see Section 16.5)  
• Concomitant or other treatment given (see Section 16.6)  
 
When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms should be identified as one overall  
event or diagnosis.  
 Any adverse event judged by [CONTACT_328342] -up Visit will be followed until it has been resolved, returned to baseline, or  become 
stable or a chronic condition.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_405354] the severity of all serious and non- serious  adverse 
events. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version 4.019 should 
be used for grading the severity of adverse events. Adverse events of  CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 
should be documented as “life- threatening” in the eCRF and source documents. In considering 
the severity of an adverse event in a pediatric subject, the investigator should consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters  may differ from those given in the 
CTCAE. An adverse event  that does not appear in the  CTCAE should be determined according 
to the definitions in Table 16- 1. A copy of the CTCAE will be provided as and attachment to the 
protocol.  
 
Table 16- 1 Grading of Adverse Event Severity  
 Mild (Grade 1)   Awareness of the event; may cause minimal interference with the  
    subject’s daily  life. 
     
 
Moderate (Grade 2)   Discomfort enough to cause a noticeable impact on the   
    subject’ s daily life. 
 
Severe (Grade 3)   Incapacitation or significant impact  on the subject’s daily life.  
 
Life- Threatening (Grade 4)  Subject in immediate risk of death from the event as it occurs. It  
    does not I nclude an event that, if it were to occur in a more severe 
    form, might cause death.  
 
16.3 Adverse Event Casuality  
 
The investigator will  assess the relationship of the adverse event, if any, to the study drug.  
Causality should be classified using the categories presented in Table 16- 2. 
 
Table 16-2 Classifications for Adverse Event Causality  
 
Related  Event follows a reasonable temporal association from 
administration of study  drug without significant alternative etiology. 
May be supported by [CONTACT_328343]/or a positive re- challenge.  
 
Possibly Related  Event follows a reasona ble temporal association from 
administration of study  drug and may have been produced by [CONTACT_941] 
18 
Version Date 09/02/[ADDRESS_405355]’s clinical state or other factors.   Information on drug 
withdrawal (dechallenge) may be lacking or unclear.  
 
Unlikely Related  Event may or may not follow a clear temporal association with 
study drug  administration and is probably produced by [CONTACT_1560]'s clinical state or other  factors. Also includes clinical 
events for which there is insufficient information or contradictory 
information which prohibits a proper assessment.  
 
Not Related  No relationship between the event and administration of the study 
drug.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_405356] to an Adverse  
Event  
 
Drug Interrupted     Study drug administration stopped in response 
to an adverse event. If study drug 
administration is not re- started, this action 
changes to“drug withdrawn.”  
Drug Withdrawn    Study drug administration permanently 
discontinued in response to an adverse event.  
Dose Not Changed   Study drug dose not changed in response to 
the adverse event.  
Not Applicable   Action taken regarding study drug 
administration does not apply. “Not  applicable” 
should be used in circumstances such as when the subject has died, or the 
investigational treatment had been completed 
before the adverse event, or adverse event 
occurred before the investigational treatment 
started  
Unknown     Action taken is unknown, e.g., a subject 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39869] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328312].  
 
16.5 Adverse Even outcome  
 
The investigator will document the outcome of the adverse event using the categories shown in 
Table 16 -4. 
 
Table 16-4 Classifications for Outcome of an Adverse Event  
  
Recovered/Resolved    Resolution of an adverse event with no 
19 
Version Date 09/02/16  residual signs or symptoms.  
Recovered/ Resolved  
With Sequelae    Resolution of an adverse event with residual 
signs or symptoms.  
Not Recovered/ Not  Resolved (Continuing)                    Either incomplete improvement or no 
improvement of an adverse event, such it 
remains ongoing.  
Fatal       Outcome of an adverse event is death. “Fatal” 
should be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the adverse event.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_405357], ECG, physical examination, and vitals signs, should be considered an adverse  
event and recorded accordingly. If possible, a diagnosis for the clinically significant study  
assessment should be provided by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., urinary tract infection or anemia). In 
the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself is listed as the adverse event  
(e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin).  
 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more  of 
the following:  
 
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
• A change in the dose of study drug or is discontinued from the study  
 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any  of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria.  
 
16.7 Treatment Given 
 
The investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the adverse event.  “Yes” is 
used if any  treatment was given in response to an adver se event, and may include treatments 
such as other medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], surgery, or physical therapy.  “No” indicates the 
absence of any kind of treatment for an adverse event.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_405358] elevations of >[ADDRESS_405359] level, as  clinically indicated.  
 
Study drug administration will  be interrupted immediately and the DSMB Chair will be notified if 
any of the following criteria is met:  
 • ALT or AST >8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• Total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice, in association w ith elevation of ALT or AST >3 
× ULN  
 
20 
Version Date 09/02/[ADDRESS_405360] will be 
followed closely for clinical progression.  
 
If no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., viral hepatitis, alcohol ingestion) for the elevated 
transaminases is identified, regardless of whether ALT or AST levels have improved, the  subject 
will be discontinued from the study, in consultation with the Medical Monitor  
 
An early termination visit should be scheduled as soon as possible. In addition to the e arly 
termination visit assessments specified in the protocol, a blood sample should be obtained for 
pharmacokinetic analysis. Subjects discontinued for elevated transaminases should be followed 
until their transaminases normalize or ret urn to baseline.   If a convincing alternative etiology for 
the elevated transaminases is identified and the subject’s symptoms and laboratory findings 
have improved, the investigator will  consider  resuming study drug treatment in consultation with 
the PI. 
 
16.9  Definition of COPD Exacerbation.  
We will monitor the incidence and severity of COPD exacerbations to measure safety of 
ivacaftor and estimate whether a reduction in COPD exacerbations is plausible with effective 
CFTR potentiation by [CONTACT_328344], and to develop sample size estimates for future studies.  For the 
purposes of this protocol, COPD exacerbations will be defined as follows:   a complex of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (increase or new onset) of more than one of the following: cough, sputum, 
wheezing, dyspnea, or chest tightness , requiring treatment with antibiotics and/or systemic 
steroids for at least three days . 
 
17.[ADDRESS_405361] completed 84 days of the study (see Safety Monitoring and 
Interim Safety Analysis below).   
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_328313] s afety and tolerability based on 
his/her  evaluation of emerging trends and risks in reported SAEs and AEs which capture 
abnormal vital signs, physical exam findings, and abnormal laboratory tests.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_328314], within 24 hrs at maximum.   
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_328315]:  
• Does the reported adverse event  meet one of the FDA’s definitions for serious? 
• Is the event unexpected? 
• Is the event related to study drug?  
 
18.0 Interim Analysis 
 
18.1 Interim S afety Analysis  
 
Interim safety analysis will include blinded review of AEs, ECGs, and safety labs by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_328316] 10 , 20, and 30 subjects.  The interim safety analysis will 
include an interim  safety report prepared by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_328317] -Investigators  to review.  This report 
will in clude a summary of the following:

20.0  PK and PK/PD Analysis  
Intensive PK Analysis will be conducted at UAB by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. E. Acosta’s laboratory using LC/MS/MS 
method already established at our laboratory and described in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].
12 Calculated PK 
parameters include: area -under -the-curve (AUC 12), maximum plasma conc entration (C max), time 
to C max (Tmax), oral clearance (CL/F), terminal apparent distribution volume (V z/F), and 
elimination half -life (t 1/2). Subsequently, intensive data and sparse plasma concentrations will be 
combined to create a population PK model to assess covariates, such as age, weight, sex, smoking status, etc. as previously conducted by [CONTACT_328345].   PK/PD analyses between ivacaftor levels and CFTR activity in the sweat gland will 
reveal new insights into the degree that wild -type CFTR can be activated by [CONTACT_328346] . 
 
20.1  Role of Vertex IIS regarding PK analysis 
• To facilitate PK studies planned at UAB, we also request pure ivacaftor  powder and 
stable isotope labeled internal standard for assay development and validation.  We 
request 2-5 mg of each.

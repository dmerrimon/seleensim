Objectives  
 This preliminary study will modify, refine, and test a MSC training intervention, 
otherwise to be known as the CNA Wellbeing Program, for CNAs who care for nursing home residents. The proposed research will be conducted in 3 similarly rated and structured community NHs . 
 
Aim 1: Determine the feasibility, acceptability, and adaptations of the CNA Wellbeing 
Program by [CONTACT_14664] 8- week co urse in one NH with a goal of 15 CNAs , and up to 20 
CNAs per NH . Evaluation will focus on a) participation (including home practice 
adherence); b) attendee evaluation of training; c) barriers/facilitators of participation; d) use and retention of session  materials by [CONTACT_4317]; and e) recommendations for 
improvement.    
 Aim 2: Conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_673287] [ADDRESS_909838] of training by [CONTACT_35755] a) attendance, b) satisfaction with training, c) pre -post measures 
of self- compassion, intent to leave job, perceived stress, job satisfaction, burnout, and 
attitudes towards persons with dementia.  
Interventions and Duration  
Mindful Self -Compassion has been developed and validated in other populations as a 
course of eight 2.5-  hour weekly sessions. A modified version of this program will be 
tested in Aim 2, which is also a validated version of the MSC program. This version is six, 1 -hour weekly sessions. Each session  begins with meditation, follows with discussion 
of previous  week’s home practice, introduction of main theme of session  and new formal 
and informal practices. Each session  will be offered in a location convenient t o the NH, 
outside of work hours, at times convenient for participants, and offered at two different times to accommodate schedules.   
Sample Size and Population  
Eligibility to this study will include: Certified Nursing Assistant employed by [CONTACT_673306]; over the age of 18; able to speak and write in English; works at NH 20 or more hours per week; expects to be employed with NH for the duration of the course; and expects to be able to attend 75%  of the sessions . Up to [ADDRESS_909839] on the Screening Questionnaires’ Perceived Stress Scale who are interested in participating.

2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
Critical role of certified nursing assistants (CNAs) in nursing homes (NHs). U.S. NHs serve 
approximately 1.[ADDRESS_909842] Alzheimer’s disease or a related cognitive disorder, require extensive help with activities of daily living, and have 
multiple chronic illnesses.
[ADDRESS_909843] hands -on care is provided by [CONTACT_159641] 634,000 
certified nursing assistants (CNAs) – a workforce that is racially diverse, predominantly female, with a 
high school or lower education, and an annual income equivalent to the poverty threshold for a family of four.
2 
 
CNA workforce experiences high stress and turnover, compromising resident care. Demand for 
CNAs is high and projected to grow;2 however, retaining CNA staff is a major challenge. National turnover 
rates average 65% annually.3 Equally concerning is CNA absenteeism, as nearly 10% do not report to 
work as scheduled.[ADDRESS_909844] been linked to poor care, including 
negative resident outcomes such as pressure ulcers, infections, pain, and reduced overall quality of life.3-8  
v. 3.18.2021  3 CNAs are predominately female; nearly half are racial/ethnic minorities; and 75% have a high 
school degree or less.[ADDRESS_909845] 
receive public assistance and/or head a single- parent household. G iven limited resources, hardships 
such as inconsistent childcare, personal illness or injury, or transportation issues can be large sources of 
stress.10  
CNAs also face emotionally and physically demanding job tasks, particularly when working with 
persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Challenging behaviors such as verbal 
aggression and physical assault are common, especially during personal care11-13 with 56% of CNAs 
reporting at least one work -related injury in the prior year, including s cratches, open wounds or cuts, back 
injuries, bruises, black eyes and human bites.[ADDRESS_909846] proposes to arm CNAs 
with larger life skills useful in difficult situations, many of which ar e beyond the person’s immediate 
control. These skills are an important adjunct to organizational change interventions and can yield 
positive effects beyond the workplace.  
 Mindfulness -based stress reduction (MBSR) is a proven strategy for stress reduction and 
promotion of well -being in heterogeneous populations. Mindfulness has been described as paying 
attention to the present with nonjudgmental awareness.
21 MBSR training is a standardized approach that 
promotes well -being in a wide variety of populations, including healthy individuals,22 persons with chronic 
conditions,23 and family caregivers.24 Taught in a series of classes, MBSR is inexpensive and highly 
accessible. In health care professionals, MBSR training decreases burnout, perceived stress, anxiety,  
and depression, while increasing well -being, empathy and compassion for others.25,26 
MBSR has been extensively studied in nurses.27,28 In the limited research that has been 
conducted on  CNAs, sample sizes were small and results mixed.29 No published research has been 
conducted in NHs –  where CNA roles are most extensive (although a pi[INVESTIGATOR_673288]).[ADDRESS_909847] has led to calls for formal and informal 
mindfulness practices to be incorporated into CAN educational programs,31 and for research on the 
downstream effects of mindfulness on patient care.32 
 
Self-Compassion (SC) and Mindful Self- Compassion (MSC): an enhanced, focused training that is 
promising yet largely unexplored. SC – a closely related construct to mindfulness –  is a particularly 
powerful new tool to reduce stress and burnout.32,33 Compassion is “sensitivity to the experience of 
suffering, coupled with a deep desire to alleviate that suffering,” and SC is this same concept focused 
inward, often described as “like treating oneself as one would a good friend when they are struggling.”34 
SC has three main, interrelated components: self -kindness (responding to challenges with self -support 
and understanding); common humanity (recognizing hardships are part of the shared human experience), and mindfulness (responding to negative thoughts and emotions with a balanced rather than 
“catastrophic” response). Since its initial description in 2003, SC has been positively linked to multiple 
measures of well -being;
35 inversely correlated to stress, depression and anxiety;36 and associated with 
resilience in the face of stressful life events.37 There is also evidence that persons with greater levels of 
v. 3.18.2021  4 self-compassion experience better interpersonal relationships and express more empathy and 
compassion for others.32,38 –[ADDRESS_909848] job burnout and compassion fatigue.41–[ADDRESS_909849] particularly high work and life stress burdens and fewer opp ortunities than 
more educated populations to learn stress management techniques, MSC skills hold particular promise 
for improving outcomes. Indeed, one study of residential dementia care found that CNAs employ a range 
of strategies, many of which are unhel pful, such as defensiveness/shutting down, unhealthy distraction 
(e.g., overeating), and psychological distress (e.g., anxiety or depression); and the authors suggested 
that mindfulness training might have a “preventive focus” by [CONTACT_79660] -care.48 Additionally, there is 
evidence that people with high levels of self -compassion more often use “positive cognitive restructuring” 
or changing one’s view of a negative situation to more a positive one,[ADDRESS_909850].  Figure 1 (below) illustrates our conceptual model. Among NH 
CNAs, work and life stress combine with low copi[INVESTIGATOR_673289], 
which in turn lead to negative attitudes toward the people they care for, life and work dissatisfaction, and 
burnout, culminating in high rates of absenteeism and turnover, leading to impairment on the quality of 
care they provide. The 
intervention we propose has 
been proven in other settings t o 
improve performance by 
[CONTACT_673308][INVESTIGATOR_25110]. If successful, MSC could be 
incorporated into the curricula of 
CNA training programs, thereby [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_673290] a more resilient, 
stable, competent workforce, 
and one better able to provide dementia- sensitive care.  
3 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a single -arm feasibility trial that will ref ine an existing MSC intervention  in preparation for a future, 
randomized controlled trial with the primary goal of improving CNA job retention. We will recruit 15 CNAs 
from a single nursing home (NH), pi[INVESTIGATOR_476555] 8- week intervention, and collect feedback via questionnaires , 
interviews  and a semi -structured focus group at the end of the course. Data from this cohort will be used 
to refine study protocols and course structure/materials for maximum feasibility and acceptability. A 
refined intervention will subsequently be tested in 30 CNAs from two NH settings (15 CNAs per home), 
with pre, post, and follow -up measurements of stress,  burnout, self -compassion, job satisfaction, attitudes 
towards dementia, and intent to leave their job.  
 
  

v. 3.18.[ADDRESS_909851] hands -on care is provided by [CONTACT_159641] 634,000 certified nursing 
assistants (CNAs) –  a workforce that is racially diverse, predominantly female, with a high school or lower 
education, and an annual income equivalent to the poverty threshold for a family of four.  The participants 
of this study will include only CNAs employed with the partnering three  Nursing Homes.  
 
The three nursing homes that have been chosen for participation fit the following criteria: overall quality (as defined by [CONTACT_673309] a 4 or 5 star rating on CMS compare), bed size (80- 120 beds), non- profit status, 
and within [ADDRESS_909852] meet all of the following inclusion criteria to participate in this study : 
• Certified Nursing Assistant working at  3 participating NHs  
• Works at least 20 hours a week (on average) with participating NHs  
• Speaks and reads English  
• Over 18 years old  
• Intends to work with NH for the durat ion of the MSC course  
• Expects to be able to attend a majority (75%) of the sessions 
If over 20  CNAs are interested in the course, and we are not able to accommodate all whom would like to 
participate, an additional inclusion criteria will be scores on the Perceived Stress Scale portion of the 
Screening Questionnaire (see Appendix D1). The [ADDRESS_909853] scores on the PSS will be 
eligible for the intervention course.  As of the completion of this trial, this measure was unnecessary.  
4.2 Study Enrollment Procedures  
All candidates will be identified and recruited from the three participating Nursing Homes . The recruitment 
process will be a multi -step process, and will gather input from the participating NHs, as well as meeting 
with CNA representatives from the nursing homes  to gather their thoughts on recruitment materials and 
strategy . See Table 1 (below) f or details.

• Begin to finalize final program participant roster.  
Week 0 • CNA Wellbeing Program  begins  
• Finish any last consenting and administering of baseline interview as 
needed.  
[ADDRESS_909854] over the course of 8 months for each participant –  this includes the duration of 
the intervention as well as follow up measures (see details below).   
Before the onset of the intervention , interested participants will complete the Screening Questionnaire, in 
order to gather their scores on the Perceived Stress Scale. If over [ADDRESS_909855] has been determined,  the study will begin with informed, written consent, and 
an initial Baseline Interview, no more than 2 weeks before the onset of the course.  
The intervention will be administered over the course of 8- weeks  for Nursing Home 1, and over the 
course of 6- weeks for Nursing Home 2 & 3 , and follows the pre- created agenda for the Mindful Self -
Compassion course (see below, Table 2) . Participants will be texted weekly by [CONTACT_464], with reminders 
of the next session, as well as a recap of the previous session. At the beginning of  the course, study staff 
will collect Weekly Questionnaires on each participant.  This will be given by [CONTACT_673311] . If a participant has missed a session , study staff will follow up to collect a modified 
Weekly Questionnaire by [CONTACT_648].  Towards the end of the course, a half -day (4 hour) retreat was  offered to 
participating CNAs  (of Nursing Homes 1) . They were encouraged to attend this retreat, however, it was  
not required and attendance (or non- attendance) did not impact their participation in the study.  Ultimately, 
the retreat was not held due to difficulties with scheduling.  
No more than two weeks after the termination of the course, study staff will administer an End- of-Program 
Interview  either in person or via telephone, according to the convenience of the participant .  
Additionally, there will be one shortened weekly focus group session (1 hour in length) after the last week 
v. 3.18.[ADDRESS_909856] and analyze feedback. The sessions for Nursing Home 
#2 & #3 wer e formalized into focus groups, whereas the session for Nursing Home #1 was an open 
discussion session.  
Study staff will reach back out to all participants after the culmination of the program, in order to 
administer the 3/[ADDRESS_909857] concluded.  
Additionally, in order to compare the stress levels and demographic information of CNAs who participate 
in the program versus those who work at the participating nursing home, we will ask CNAs present at a 
staff meeting to fill out a short survey with the Perceived Stress Scale and demographic information.

Session  Title Content  
1 Discovering Mindful 
Self-Compassion  Introduction and orientation to the program. The main concepts 
are defining self -compassion and becoming familiar with the link 
between self -compassion and well -being.  
2 Practicing Mindfulness  Focuses on mindfulness, defined as awareness of present -
moment experience. Resistance is described and presented as a 
source of much of our suffering. Awareness meditations are 
“warmed up” with affection and appreciation.  
3 Practicing 
Lovingkindness  Participants learn the difference between lovingkindness, 
compassion and mindfulness, and learn how to use phrases in 
lovingkindness meditation.  
4 Discover ing Your 
Compassionate Voice  Lovingkindness meditation is practiced, and participants learn to 
self-motivate with encouragement rather than criticism. Stages of 
progress are identified and discussed.  
5 Living Deeply  Participants discover core values (what gives their lives meaning) 
and learn how to re- orient themselves to them in daily life. 
Compassion and self -compassion are practiced through listening 
to others.  
[ADDRESS_909858] to alleviate shame.  
7 Exploring Challenging 
Relationships  Self-compassion practices are used to meet unmet needs in 
relationships as well as to manage caregiving fatigue.  
8 Embracing Your Life  Focuses on how to maintain meditation practice after the course 
ends, as well as how to practice savoring, gratitude, and self - 
appreciation as corrective measures for negativity bias.

*Begins [ADDRESS_909860] scores on the Screening Questionnaire (which includes the Perceived Stress 
Scale). This questionnaire will be collected during information sessions by [CONTACT_17033].  
 
While presenting on the course during the information session, the research staff  will have with them 
a sign- in/interest sheet in the course. The interest sheet will have ID  number s preprinted (i.e. for the 
Nursing Home in Aim 1, 101, 102, 103, 104, etc.) . The Screening  Questionnaire will have the ID 
number  pre-printed onto the questionnaire, so that when any individual chooses to sign up to the 
interest list, and wants to do the Screening Questionnaire, they will be immediately given an ID# and 
then handed the corresponding questionnaire.  
 Once they’ve received the Screening Questionnaire, they will be able to independently read the 
embedded consent form and determine thei r interest in participating in the Screening Questionnaire.  
Any CNAs interested in participating in the full study and adding their name [CONTACT_673326], but that by [CONTACT_673312], they are not automatically enrolled .  
 
Alternatively, for CNAs who reach out to the study staff directly from the posted recruitment flyers, a 
verbal consent will be read to them to participate in the Screening Questionnaire, if they are 
interested.  
 
While study staff is recruiting CNAs, [s]he will have a folder  with them in order to collect all 
Questionnaires. Identifiable information  from the interest sheets  and linking ID#s will be transferred to 
an electronic folder, stored on the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research’s secure 
servers, separately from any data.   
 
B. The second consent process will be with all participants’  who are committed to joining the intervention 
program. Throughout the recruitment process, participants will be able to sign up on an  interest sheet  
to indicate their interest. These participants will be able to sign up physically, during the recruitment 
sessions, or reach out directly to study staff to have their name [CONTACT_673327] . Once 
CNAs have expressed interest, the study staff will reach out to them one- on-one through their 
preferred method of communication (telephone, text, or email), and verify their commitment to the program.  
 
Once commitment and eligibility have been confirmed, study staff will set up one- on-one meetings 
with participants in order to review the written consent form.  This will take place up to [ADDRESS_909861] access.   
 
 
 
v. 3.18.2021  11 Screening   
 
This study will take up to 20  CNAs per Nursing Home. If 20 or fewer CNAs are interested in the CNA 
Wellbeing Program, all those interested will be able to participate. However, if over 20 CNAs are 
interested in the program (within one Nursing Home), the Scr eening Questionnaire administered during 
the recruitment process will be used to determine the [ADDRESS_909862] scores on the Perceived 
Stress Scale.  The study’s goal is to recruit 15 CNAs per Nursing Home.  
 
In the event that there are over 20 CNAs interested and the study is not able to accommodate all CNAs, 
some Mindful Self -Compassion materials will be provi ded to those who are not able to join the program .  
 
6.2.2 Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization 
CNAs will be enrolled in the screening process after they have read the embedded consent form on the 
Screening Questionnaire, and have chosen to fill out the qu estionnaire. The Screening Questionnaire 
involves demographic questions as well as the Perceived Stress Scale.  
 
For the intervention portion of the study, CNAs will be enrolled after reviewing and signing the written  consent form with study staff in a one- on-one process. This process will occur up to 2 weeks before 
enrollment in the course  begins.  
 Once enrolled, participants complete an in- person interview  (the Baseline Interview ) with study staff . This 
baseline interview will capture their preliminary scores on:  
 
• Stress levels 
• Attitudes towards dementia  
• Job satisfaction and intent to leave job  
• Burnout score  
• Self-compassion score  
• Depression score 
 
6.2.3 Follow -up Visits  
After initial enrollment, and collection of the Baseline Interview, CNAs will begin p articipating in the 
intervention, the CNA Wellbeing Program. There will be 8 intervention sessions, as well as a 9th session 
for feedback (or, 6 intervention sessions, and a 7th for feedback , if taking the 6- week version of the 
program).  Additionally, CNAs will be approached at the End -of-Program  mark, and the 3/ [ADDRESS_909863] course, to gat her additional survey responses. These interviews will continue to capture the 
participants’  scores on:  
 
• Stress levels 
• Attitudes towards dementia  
• Job satisfaction and intent to leave job  
• Burnout score  
• Self-compassion scores  
• Depression score 
 See above (in section 6.1 Schedule of Evaluations)  for an exact  list of what will be collected from CNAs at 
each point,  baseline,  weekly, post course, 3- months,  and 6- months. 
 
6.2.4 Completion/ Final Evaluation  
Study staff will continue to follow up with participants until the point of the final evaluation, the 6- month 
Follow Up Interview.

• Emotional or economic (employment -related) harm due to breech of confidentiality. This includes 
breech of confidentially regarding any personal information shared during the group intervention 
sessions, questionnaire data, or outcome data collected from administrative records . 
 
Potential Benefits:  
 
The potential benefits to study participants include:  
• Stress -management skills that may improve well -being and positively impact relationships and job 
performance.  
• Lifetime access t o resources (e.g., audio guided meditations, course materials) that may help 
sustain well -being and stress -management skills.  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
This study employs a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC), composed of 3 members in order to monitor 
the safety of this study. See below for details on the process by [CONTACT_673315]/Serious Adverse 
Events are defined, and will be handled.    
7.2 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse event (AE):  Any unfavorable and unintended change in physical or mental health status (i.e.  
new or worsening physical or mental health signs, symptoms, or disease) or loss of employment associated with participation in the study, regardless of whether it is considered related to the study.  
 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) : Any AE that: r esults in death; i s life threatening, or places the 
participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity ; results in congenital anomalies or bi rth defects  
 Unanticipated problems (UPs): Involves  risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, 
experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
o Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
o Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
o Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater r isk of harm (including physical, 
psychological,
 economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
7.3 Reporting Procedures  
Given course content can bring up difficult emotions, study staff  will mon itor depressive symptoms 
weekly . Study staff will also ask participants to report any changes in their physical health that may be 
v. 3.18.2021  13 related to their participation in the study, with the exception of transient discomfort during sitting practices. 
Examples of potentially relevant, although unlikel y, physical health changes include: headaches, body or 
joint aches, or an injury occurring during mindfulness practice. These examples will be given to 
participants, with the caveat that they should err on the side of caution and over -reporting. Additional ly, in 
order to monitor for participants’ at risk of giving birth to a child with a birth defect, the intervention 
instructors will report to Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_673291].   
 
In order to facilitate the reporting of potential AEs to study staff, the following procedures will be in place:  
 
[1] During the 8- week intervention period, participants will be engaged in weekly  group discussions about 
home practice, challenges to practice, and well-being. Any participant endorsing difficulties that the 
course facilitators feel are potentially beyond transient or typi[INVESTIGATOR_673292].  
 [2] Participants will be given study staff contact [CONTACT_3031], including st udy phone and e- mail addresses. 
Participants will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_673316].  
 
[3] At the beginning of each weekly session , and at [ADDRESS_909864] the PROMIS depression screen at baseline. For the 
purposes of this study, any participant whose PROMIS depression score moves from a lower category 
into the severe category (i.e. greater than or equal to a T -score of 70) will be flagged as a potential 
adverse event and will prompt follow up by [CONTACT_372785] a phone call by [CONTACT_673317]. Study staff will also notify the course instructors of the increased emotional distress so that extra 
support can be provided as needed.  
 
The study team member receiving information from participants about a potential AE related to the study 
will complete an Adverse Event Form.  
7.[ADDRESS_909865] manager or study staff will report all AEs to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_673293], after having gathered all necessary details  (from the Weekly 
Questionnaire, as well as further communication with the participant if needed) . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_673294], and will confer with the SMC as needed. If the AE is serious and/or unexpected, possibly related to study participation, and suggests increased risk for participants, the procedures outlined below will also be followed.  
 AE reports will collected by [CONTACT_673318], s ummarized and de - identified. A summary 
report of all AEs to date will be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_673295]: 1) mid- intervention (4- week 
mark); 2) post -intervention (8- week mark); 3) post 3- month follow -up; 4) post 6- month follow -up.  
 Furthermore, all AEs will be summarized as part of the Data and Safety Monitoring Report submitted 
post-Phase [ADDRESS_909866] manager or study staff will report all SAEs to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_673296], after having gathered all necessary details. For all deaths and 
for any SAE related or possibly related to study participation, the PI w ill send this report and any 
additional information, including corrective actions already taken, within 24 hours to the SMC chair, UNC 
IRB and NIA program officer. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_673297], NIA, and/or S MC.  
 
Unexpected and Related AEs/UPs with increased risk . All AEs that are deemed 1) unexpected; 2) 
possibly or probably related to study participation; and 3) suggests increased risk for study participants will be reported to the UNC IRB, NIA project offi cer, and the SMC chair within 48 hours of study team 
awareness of the event, using each organizations’ respective reporting formats. In these reports, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_673298]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_673299], NIA, and/or SMC.  
 
The SMC will meet in person (or virtually for long- distance members as needed) at least 3 times 
throughout the study to review the Data and Safety Monitoring Report: 1) prior to first enrol lment ; 2) after 
completion of the field test (Phase 1) using the standardized intervention; 3) after completion of the 
refined intervention (Phase 2).  
 Additional meetings (ad- hoc) will occur as requested by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_673300]. Any recommended changes by [CONTACT_673319].  
8 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
 
We will prepare interim analyses to evaluate the safety of the intervention after Phase 1 and again after 
Phase 2. One of the tasks of the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be to review preliminary data 
from the study and make a recommendation RE whether or not the study should continue. The following 
are the reasons we propose for discontinuing the study early:  
 
• The occurrence of a serious adverse event, possibly or definitely related to the study protocol, occurring in any participant. In this study, it would include serious psychological distress causing death, suicide attempt, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Severe adverse events, possibly or definitely related to the study protocol, occurring in 3 or more participants. In this study, this would include participants who withdrew from the study due to new 
psychological symptoms or who were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_673301]. Given the high-
stress nature of the participants jobs and lives, and given MSC involves prompting participants to become aware of and attend to their own needs, it is possible that study participation prompts mental health care that had been needed previously, but was perhaps ignored or not prioritized. Thus, severe cases will be examined carefully by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_673302].  
• Interim analyses will provide summary data related to the above bullets and study staff will make 
these data available to the SMC at least 2 weeks before meeting, or within 24 hours  
  
9 DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
9.1 Data Collection Forms  
ID# Convention:  
 
All data will be de -identified with by [CONTACT_673320]# rather than names or other identifying information. 
This ID# will be composed of three numbers. The first number will be the Nursing Home with which 
v. 3.18.2021  15 the participant is associated. The following ID#s  numbers will be filled out by [CONTACT_673321] , starting with 01 and ending with 99.  
 
ID# Nursing Home  
1 Aim 1 NH  
2 Aim 2 NH  
3 Aim 2 NH  
 
A sample ID# will be as follows:  
 
First Digit: NH  Second and Third Digit: Participant  
1-3 01-99 
 
 
Screening Questionnaire:  
 
Initial data collection will begin with the Screening Questionnaire.  
 The Screening Questionnaire will be collected during information sessions by [CONTACT_17033]. 
While presenting on the course during the information session, study staff will have an interest sheet, 
pre-printed with ID#s, as well as Screening Questio nnaires, pre- printed with ID#s . For CNAs 
interested in signing into the interest sheet and participating in the Screening Questionnaire, they will 
sign up to a specific ID# slot, and given the corresponding Screening Questionnaire. The first page of 
each questionnaire will have an embedded consent form. Those present at the information sessions 
will be able to independently read the consent form and determine their interest in participating in the 
Screening Questionnaire. Any CNAs interested in participating in the full study and adding t heir name 
[CONTACT_673328], but that by [CONTACT_673312], they are not 
automatically enrolled.   
 
While study staff is recr uiting CNAs, [s]he will have a folder  with them in order to collect all 
Questionnaires , and will instruct CNAs to bring all completed Questionnaires directly to the study 
staff.  
 
Alternatively, this process will be available to CNAs over the phone if necessary (they reach out directly from flyers, are only able to stay for a few minutes at a recruitment session, but wish to 
complete the Screening Questionnaire at another time, etc. ). In these cases, a verbal consent will be 
read aloud to CNAs, and the Screening Questionnaire will be read for completion.  
 
Identifiable information from the interest sheet  and linking ID#s will be transferred to an electronic 
folder, stored on the Ceci l G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research’s secure servers, 
separately from any data.   
 
Baseline Interview:  
 
This data will be collected in- person or by [CONTACT_673322]. Study staff will bring a copy of the 
Baseline Interview to each in- person interview , or have a hard copy of the interview present during 
the telephone call . Before beginning, the study staff will write the appropriate ID# onto each interview. 
This ID# will have previously been assigned from the Screening Question naires. This interview will be 
done immediately after collecting c onsent from the participant, and will be done one- on-one, in 
person with the study staff. If a participant cannot complete it at the time of consenting, research staff 
and the participant wi ll complete the interview at another convenient time over the phone (or in 
person). To aid in the data collection, study staff will provide the participant with Likert Scale cards 
(laminated cards with response options to various questions within the inter view). This data will be 
collected no more than [ADDRESS_909867] session . 
v. 3.18.2021  16 Weekly Questionnaire:  
 
During the weekly sessions , the Weekly Questionnaire  as well as the Weekly Attendance will be 
collected by [CONTACT_673323].  
 In order to collect this questionnaire confidentially, the study instructors will have a set of manila 
folders – one for each participant in the program. On the manila folders, will be a Post -It note with the 
participants’ name. Within each folder, will be a Weekly Questionnaire (with their ID# already put into 
their questionnaire). The instructor will hand out each folder to the study participants at the beginning 
of the session. Study participants will be instr ucted to complete the questionnaire, and put their 
answers back into the manila folder. At this point, the study instructor will collect all manila folders, and remove the Post -It notes with names, in order to immediately de- identify the collected data.  This 
process will happen weekly, at each session . 
 
For participants who need to miss a session, for whatever reason, they will be followed up with on the 
phone by [CONTACT_464]. Study staff will administer the Weekly Questionnaire – Absent Version.   
 For weekly sessions, study staff will meet with the intervention instructors once a week, in order to collect weekly hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_673303].   
 
Semi -Structured Focus Group Guide : 
 
The final session, a semi -structured feedback session on the Program and concepts explored in the 
program, includes a semi -structured focus group guide. This session will be audio- recorded.  
 
End-of-Program  Interview:  
 
This data will be collected in phone or in person by [CONTACT_5984]. Research assistant will attend the 
final session , and bring an Sign Up for End- of-Program Interview  for participants to choose when and 
in what form they would like to do the End- of-Program  interview. Slots will be offered immediately 
following the session , and for immediately before and after the final semi -structured focus group . For 
interviews that cannot be completed at those times, study staff and participant will arrange an 
alternative time to either conduct a phone interview, or an in- person i nterview, according to the 
participants’ convenience. Study staff will bring a copy of the End- of Program Interview to each in-
person interview, or  have a hard copy of the interview present during the telephone call . Once 
interview is confirmed (in person or phone call), study staff will arrange to either bring with them, or 
email or mail beforehand Likert cards (with response options for various questions in the interview)  to 
aid in participants’ responses . Before beginning, the study staff will write the appropriate ID# onto 
each interview. This ID# will have previously been assigned.  This interview will be collected no more 
than two weeks after the  end of the final session .  
 
3/6 Month Follow Up Interview:  
 
This data will be collected in phone or in person by [CONTACT_5984]. Study staff will bring a copy of 3/[ADDRESS_909868] copy of the interview present 
during the telephone call.  Once interview is confirmed (in person or phone call), study staff will 
arrange to either bring with them, or email or mail beforehand Likert cards (with response options for various questions in the interview ) to aid in participants’ responses . Before beginning, the study staff 
will write the appropriate ID# onto each interview. This ID# will have previously been assigned.  This 
data will be collected as close to the [ADDRESS_909869] Wellbeing Program as is 
possible within the participants’ schedules. This means data will be collected either within the two 
weeks before the 3/6 month mark, or within the two weeks  after the 3/6 month mark.  
 
v. 3.18.2021  17 9.2 Data Management  
All data will be stored on computers and secure servers in locked offices within the Cecil G. Sheps Center 
for Health Services Research. All hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_673304], accessible only to study staff. All ha rdcopi[INVESTIGATOR_673305]- identified, with a linking ID# (as is 
the case for the Screening Questionnaire, Baseline Interview, Weekly Questionnaire, End- of-Program 
Interview, and 3/6 Month Follow Up Interview).  
Study staff will be double entering data int o Access Databases housed on the Cecil G. Sheps servers to 
ensure mistakes are not made during data entry. Analysis will be completed by [CONTACT_673324], Christopher Wretman.  
[ADDRESS_909870] (IRB) Review  
This protocol and the informed consent document  and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_109753].  
10.[ADDRESS_909871] scores on the Screening Questionnaire (which includes the 
Perceived Stress Scale). This questionnaire will be collected during information sessions by [CONTACT_163739].  
 
While presenting on the course during the information session, study staff will have with them Screeni ng Questionnaires with pre- printed ID#s, as well as an embedded consent on the first 
page of the questionnaire. For CNAs who choose to take the Screening Questionnaire over the phone, a verbal consent will be read out to them for their response.  
 
B. The second consent process will be with all participants’ who are committed to joining the CNA Wellbeing Program. Throughout the recruitment process, participants will be able to sign up on the interest sheet  to indicate their interest. These participants will be able to sign up physically, 
during the recruitment sessions, or reach out directly to study staff to have their name [CONTACT_673329] . Once CNAs have expressed interest, the study staff will reach out to them one-
on-one through their preferred method of communication (telephone, text, or email), and verify 
their commitment to the Wellbeing Program.  
 
Once commitment and eligibility have been confirmed, study staff will set up one- on-one 
meetings with participants in order to review the written consent form. This will take place up to [ADDRESS_909872] access.  
 
v. 3.18.2021  18 10.3 Reimbursement Schedule for Participants  
Each component of the study is associated with a separate compensation (refer to Table 3), and is a 
nominal, non- coercive amount, to reflect the time that they will be dedicating to the study.  
The CNA Wellbeing Program is being administered in two different forms of the intervention:  
1. Nurs ing Home [ADDRESS_909873], MSC program (8 weeks, 2.5 hours per week) 
administered  
2. Nursing Home 2 & [ADDRESS_909874] the modified, MSC program (6 weeks, 1.25 hours per week)  
The original compensation of $180 was awarded to persons in the NH #1, 8- week program, in which they 
were reimbursed $25 per interview, and $10 per class ($25 x 4, $10 x 8 = $180). This equates to $5.00 
per 1.25 hours of class, and $25.00 per interview. This reimbursement amount & schedule was changed 
after Nursing Home #[ADDRESS_909875].  We also readjusted our reimbursement schedule in 
response to feedback –  rather than waiting until the end of the intervention to reimburse participants for 
the first time, we added in a mid- intervention reimbursement point.  
In response to feedback, the compensation per time spent in class doubled. For those in the 6- week, 1.25 
hour-Program, participants will be reimbursed a total of $140. This includes $80 in par ticipation in all 4 
interview ($20 each), and $60 for their participation in 7.5 hours of intervention ($10 per 6, 1.25 hours 
classes) .

 SYNOPSIS  
Trial Number:  
MCP -103-312 
Trial  Title:  
A Phase 3b, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo- controlled, Parallel -group Trial of 
Linaclotide 290 µg Administered Orally for 12 Weeks Followed by a 4-week Randomized 
Withdrawal Period  in Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation  
Trial Centers:  
Approximately 80 in the [LOCATION_002]  
Development  Phase:  3b 
Objective(s) : 
To evaluate the efficacy on abdominal symptoms (abdominal bloating, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal pain ) and safety of linaclotide 290 µg administered orally to patients with 
irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS- C). 
Methodology : 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, consisting of [ADDRESS_925765] IBS- C diagnosed using Rome III criteria. Eligible patients will be randomized to 
1 of 2 treatments: linaclotide 290 µg or placebo (1:1) once daily . Patients who complete the 
12-week Treatment Period will enter the 4 -week Randomized Withdrawal (RW) Period and be 
allocated to study drug in a double-blind manner, as follows: 
• Patients randomized to linaclotide 290 µg during the Treatment Period will be 
rerandomized to linaclotide 290 µg or placebo (1:1) 
• Patients randomized to placebo during the Treatment Period will be allocated to linaclotide 290 µg

 Overview of Trial Design  
 
 
Trial Periods  
1. Screening Period : The Screening Period starts with the signing o f the informed consent 
form (ICF; Appendix 1) and may last for up to 21 days. During this period, patient 
eligibility for entry into the Pretreatment Period will be determined. The end of the Screening Period co incides with the start of the Pretreatment Period. If the patient 
meets the entry criteria assessed at the Screening Visit and does not require a washout of prohibited medicines (see Appendix 2), the Screening V isit and Pretreatment Visit 
may be combined into one visit. 
2. Pretreatment Period : The Pretreatment Period is defined as the 14 to 21 days 
immediately before the Randomization Visit. During this period, patients will provide the following information in a ha ndheld electronic diary (eDiary):

Patients who satisfy all entry criteria will enter the Treatment Period.  
3. Treatment Period : The Treatment Period begins with treatment assignment and lasts 
for 12 weeks. Patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: linaclotide 
[ADDRESS_925766]. Patients will continue to use the handhe ld eDiary to provide their Daily BM -related and 
Abdominal Symptom- severity Assessments, weekly assessments ( as described above 
and including Weekly Patient Assessment of Treatment Satisfaction) , and Use of 
Bisacodyl  or Other Laxatives, Suppositories, or Enemas. Other patient -reported 
outcomes assessments (IBS Quality of Life Questionnaire [IBS -QOL] and CDC 
Healthy Days Core Module [CDC HRQOL -4]) will be administered at trial visits 
throughout the Treatment Period. Patients will complete a Week 4 Visit, Week  8 Visit, 
and Week 12/End-of- Treatment -Period (ETP) Visit  during the Treatment Period (see 
Schedule of Evaluations ). 
4. Randomized Withdrawal (RW) Period: The RW Period is defined as the 4 weeks 
immediately following the Treatment Period. Patients who complete the 12 -week 
Treatment Period and return for the Week 12/ ETP Visit will enter the 4 -week RW 
Period and be allocated to study drug in a double-blind manner, as follows: 
◦ Patients randomized to linaclotide 290 µg during the Treatment Period will be 
rerandomi zed to linaclotide 290 µg or placebo (1:1) 
◦ Patients randomized to placebo during the Treatment Period will be allocated to linaclotide [ADDRESS_925767] dose of study drug in the RW Period the day after  the 
Week  12/ETP Visit (this will be considered RW Day 1). As during the Treatment 
Period, study drug will be taken once daily in the morning at least [ADDRESS_925768]. Patients will continue to use the handheld eDiary to provide their daily assessments, weekly assessments, and laxative use. Other patient -reported outcomes 
will be administered at the trial visit during the RW Period. At the end of the RW Period, patients will complete the Week 16/End- of-Trial (EOT) Visit.

Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Matching placebo oral capsule administered in a double-blind manner once daily in the morning at least [ADDRESS_925774]. 
Duration of Treatment:   
The test product and reference therapy will be administered for [ADDRESS_925775] for up to 162 days.  
Criteria for Evaluation: 
Primary Ef ficacy Assessments  
The following efficacy assessments entered in the eDiary are used to determine the primary 
efficacy endpoint: daily patient assessments of abdominal bloating, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal pain  at their worst over the last 24 hours (each on an 11-point NRS). 
Additional Efficacy Assessments  
In addition to the primary efficacy assessments, additional efficacy assessments are based on daily assessments of SBMs and CSBMs (including number and day/time of BMs, laxative use, and completen ess of evacuation), stool consistency as measured on both the 7 -point BSFS and 
5-point ordinal scale, and straining as measured on a 5-point ordinal scale. Additional efficacy 
assessments based on  weekly assessments include  the Weekly Patient Assessment of  
Constipation Severity, the Weekly Patient Assessment of IBS Symptom Severity, the Weekly Patient Assessment of Adequate Relief, and the Weekly Patient Assessment of Treatment Satisfaction.  
Safety  Measures : 
AE recording (each visit), clinical laboratory measures (chemistry and hematology: Screening, Randomization, Week 12/ ETP, and Week 16/E OT Visits), body weight (each visit), vital sign 
parameters (each visit).  
Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Populations 
• The Screened Population consists of all patients who had a Screening Visit (Visit 1) and 
were assigned a patient identification (PID) number.  
• The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population consists of all randomized patients. 
• The RW Population consists of all patients who were rerandomized or allocated to study 
drug upon completion of the Treatment Period. 
• The Safety Population consists of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.

 General Methods  
Efficacy outcomes from the Treatment Period will be based on the ITT Population and will be 
summarized b y treatment group assigned at the Randomization Visit. Efficacy outcomes from 
the RW Period only or from the Combined Treatment and RW Period will be based on the RW Population and will be summarized by [CONTACT_683694] 12/ ETP 
Visit. Treatment periods will be summarized for safety in the same manner as efficacy; 
however, s afety summaries (Safety Population) will be based on actual treatment received.  
Descriptive statistics including the number of patients, mean, minimum and maximum,  and 
standard deviation (SD) will be calculated for continuous variables. Frequencies and percentages for each category will be calculated for categorical variables. Percentages will be based on the total number of non-missing values. The number missing will be presented, but without a percentage. All hypothesis tests will be two -sided at a 5% significance level, and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be used, unless stated otherwise. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
• Change from Baseline in Abdominal Score  at Each Week  
A patient’s daily Abdominal S core is calculated as the average of the daily patient 
assessments of abdominal bloating at its worst, abdominal discomfort at its worst, and abdominal pain at its worst. If 2 or more of the individual daily abdominal s ymptoms are 
missing, then the Abdominal Score for that day will be missing. The weekly Abdominal Score is the average of the non -missing Abdominal Scores during each w eek (Weeks 1 -12) 
in the trial. The baseline Abdominal Score is the average of the non- missing Abdominal 
Scores during the 14- day P retreatment Period  and the day of the Randomization Visit 
reported prior to randomization. Change from baseline will be calculated for each week as the weekly score minus the baseline score.  
 
Primary Efficacy Analys is 
Inferential testing between the linaclotide [ADDRESS_925776] to the change from baseline in abdominal score over the T reatment Period will be evaluated 
employing a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) framework with week (categorical), treatment, geographic region, and week -by-treatment fixed effects, patient as the 
random effect, and baseline value as a covariate. An unstructured covariance structure will be utilized. Descriptive statistics based on the MMRM model will include least -squares (LS) 
mean change from baseline for each treatment, the LS mean difference between linaclotide 290 µg and placebo, corresponding 95% CIs, and the p- value associated with the comparison.

Confidential  Page 13 of 118 
 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
• Change from Baseline in 12-week Abdominal Score (Cumulative Distribution Function 
[CDF ]) 
Daily Abdominal S core is calculated as described for the primary endpoint above. The 
12-week Abdominal Score is the average on the non-missing Abdominal Scores reported 
over the course of the Tr eatment P eriod. The baseline Abdominal Score is the average of 
the non-missing Abdominal Scores during the 14- day P retreatment P eriod  and the day of 
the Randomization Visit reported prior to randomization. Change from baseline will be calculated as the 12 -week score minus the baseline score. 
• 6/12 Week Abdominal Score Responder 
A 6/[ADDRESS_925777] 2 points (ie, a -2 change from baseline)  
in the respective weekly  abdominal score. If a patient did not enter information into the 
eDiar y on at least [ADDRESS_925778] with Hodges -Lehmann estimator for the median difference. 
A secondary time- course analysis of the Change from Baseline in Abdominal Score (see 
primary endpoint definition above) will also be conducted. Using the MMRM framework defined in the primary analyses, treatment difference between linaclotide 290 µg and placebo will be assessed at each individual week.  For each week, descriptive statistics based o n the 
MMRM model will include the LS mean change from baseline for each treatment, the LS 
mean difference between linaclotide 290 µg and placebo, corresponding 95% CIs, and the p-value associated with the treatment comparison. 
For the secondary responder endpoint, the proportion of responders in the linaclotide 290 µg group will be compared to the proportion of responders in the placebo group using a Cochran-Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for geographic region. The number and percent of 
responders, the difference in responder rates between the linaclotide 290 µg and placebo groups, the odds ratio relative to placebo, all corresponding 95% CIs, and the p- value 
associated with the CMH test will be presented.

 Controlling for Multiplicity  
The overall family -wise Type I error rate for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses will 
be controlled at the α=0.05 level by [CONTACT_18120] a fixed -sequence procedure as described 
below. Following the fixed -sequence procedure, if the primary hypothesis between the pla cebo 
group and the linaclotide 290 µg group is statistically significant (α=0.05) in the ITT 
Population, then the primary objective of the trial will have been achieved and the next 
hypothesis can be tested ; otherwise, testing will stop. The testing of each sequential hypothesis 
is conditional on all the previous hypotheses being rejected at the 0.05 level of significance. If 
a hypothesis is not rejected  at the 0.05 level of significance, then all remaining hypotheses are 
deemed not statistically significan t. All hypothesis testing will be two -sided.  
1. Linaclotide vs. placebo – Change from Baseline in Abdominal Score (primary efficacy 
analysis)  
2. Linaclotide vs. placebo – Change from Baseline in 12 -week Abdominal Score (CDF) 
(secondary efficacy analysis)  
3. Linaclo tide vs. placebo – 6/12 Week Abdominal Score Responder (secondary efficacy 
analysis)  
4. Linaclotide vs. placebo – Change from Baseline in Abdominal Score at Week 12

Additional Efficacy Analyses  
Change- from -baseline endpoints and Treatment Satisfaction will be analyzed utilizing the 
same MMRM methods as described above for the primary analysis , and by [CONTACT_683695]. Responder endpoints will be analyzed using the methodology 
defined for the secondary responder analysis. 
RW Peri od Analysis 
All RW endpoints will be summarized for the RW Period only and for the Combined 
Treatment and RW Period using descriptive statistics  and 95% CIs for each treatment 
sequence. No statistical inference will be performed.  
Safety Analysis  
All safety  parameters will be analyzed descriptively in accordance with the General Methods.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of 600 patients ( 300 patients per treatment group) was chosen to ensure 
adequate power for testing the fixed -sequence procedure for the primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints as defined above. 
The power calculations for the primary endpoint are based on the placebo and linaclotide 
290 µg treatment groups from the Phase 3 trial LIN -MD-31. The patients in LIN -MD-31 are 
considered representative of the patient population for this trial. Using a resampling with replacement -based simulation (1000 iterations) and controlling for multiplicity as outlined 
above, the trial will have >99% power to reject the primary endpoint and ~ 94% power to reject 
all primary and secondary hypotheses defined in the testing process.

 3. INTRODUCTION 
3.1 IBS-C 
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder 
characterized by [CONTACT_683699]/or discomfort, accompanied by 
[CONTACT_683700] a feeling of bloating.( 2-6) In moderate to severe cases of IBS, an 
overall deterioration in quality of life (QOL) is often present.( 7) IBS is one of the most 
frequently seen disorders in the [LOCATION_002]; data suggest the prevalence of IBS is 11- 14% of 
the adult population.( 7) IBS is subtyped as IBS with di arrhea (IBS -D) or IBS with constipation 
(IBS -C), based on Rome criteria . Patients who meet criteria for both diarrhea and constipation 
are subtyped as IBS mixed (IBS -M); patients who do not fit into any of these three subtypes are 
classified as having uncl assified IBS (IBS -U).(8) 
3.2 LINACLOTIDE 
Linaclotide (LINZESS®) is an orally -administered, minimally -absorbed 14- amino acid synthetic 
peptide agonist of guanylate cyclase C (GC -C) approved by [CONTACT_13229] 2012 for the treatment of 
IBS-C and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults. As a GC- C agonist, linaclotide and its 
active metabolite improve bowel symptoms and abdominal pain via agonism of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) on the intestinal mucosa. Linaclotide induces fluid secretion in two 
ways: 1) by [CONTACT_683701] (CFTR) ion channels , resulting in secretion of chloride and bicarbonate 
into the intestinal lumen , resulting in accelerated transit ;(9) and 2) by [CONTACT_683702].( 10) These effects on fluid dynamics within the GI tract are believed to 
play a role in accelerating intestinal transit and increasing stool water, which in turn results in 
softer stools. Orally administered linaclotide has also been shown to reduce visceral 
hypersensitivity  in animal models and  abdominal pain in patients with IBS -C.(11) Linaclotide is 
believed to r educe abdominal pain by [CONTACT_683703].

 3.3 LINACLOTIDE CLINICAL  DEVELOPMENT 
The clinical development program for LINZESS® that culminated in FDA approval for use in 
adult pati ents with IBS -C included two  large double-blind, placebo-controlled registration 
trials. (12, 13) These trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of linaclotide at a dose of 290 µg, 
administered as an oral capsule. One trial had a 26 -week Treatment Period and one trial had a 
12-week Treatment Period followed by a 4 -week Randomized Withdrawal Period; however, the 
overall design of both Phase [ADDRESS_925794] 12 weeks of the Treatment 
Period. Bot h trials met all pre -specified primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. For each of 
the four primary efficacy parameters, the linaclotide dose group in both trials had statistically significantly higher proportions of responders compared with placebo (controlling for 
multiplicity). For all secondary efficacy change -from -baseline parameters (including complete 
spontaneous bowel movement [CSBM] frequency rate, spontaneous bowel movement [SBM] frequency rate, stool consistency, straining, abdominal bloating, abdominal discomfort, 
abdominal pain, and abdominal pain-free days) and responder parameters (6/12 Week CSBM +1 
Responder and 6/12 Week Abdominal Pain Responder), the linaclotide group demonstrated 
statistically significant improvement compared with the placebo group (p<0.01 for all secondary 
parameters controlling for multiplicity) in both trials.  
Linaclotide was well- tolerated in these trials. (12, 13 ) There were no deaths. One patient died 
during the Screening Per iod but never received either linaclotide or placebo. There were a total 
of 15 SAEs in the 2 trials. There were 9 (1.1%) SAEs in placebo-treated patients and 6 (0.7%) SAEs in linaclotide -treated patients. Overall, there was no obvious pattern in the types of SAEs 
experienced in either the placebo or linaclotide group. There were no SAEs of diarrhea. Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurred in 54.9% of placebo-treated and 60.8% of 
linaclotide -treated patients. Diarrhea was the most frequent TEAE and was repor ted in 3.0% of 
patients treated with placebo and 19.8% of patients treated with linaclotide. Diarrhea was 
generally mild to moderate in severity. Diarrhea resulted in the discontinuation of 0.4% of 
patients treated with placebo and 5.3% treated with linaclotide.

 More recently, a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group, dose- range-finding study evaluated 2 different delayed release (DR) 
tablet formulations of linaclotide (DR1 and DR2) , the FDA -approved 290-µ g LINZESS® (the 
immediate release [ IR] capsule formulation of linaclotide), and placebo administered once daily 
for 12 weeks. A total of 532 patients with IBS- C (Rome III criteria) were randomized in equal 
proportions to 1 of 8 treatment groups: 
• Linaclotide DR1 (30 µ g, 100 µg, 300 µg ) 
• Linaclotide DR2 (30 µg , 100 µg, 300 µg ) 
• Linaclotide IR  (LINZESS®) 290 µg  
• Placebo  
All 532 patients randomized to treatment (ITT Population) took at least 1 dose of study drug 
(Safety Population). Demographics and baseline clinical characteristics were generally similar across the 8 treatment  groups, which each included 66-67 patients. Results for the linaclotide IR 
290 µg and placebo groups are summarized below. 
The key efficacy endpoints were: change from baseline (CFB) in weekly abdominal pain (-1.9 in 
the linaclotide IR group versus -1.4 in the placebo group) , CFB in weekly CSBM frequency rate 
(2.1 in the linaclotide IR group versus 1.1 in the placebo group; p<0.05), and 6/12 W eek 
Abdominal Pain and Constipation ( APC ) +1 Responder (3 1.8% in the linaclotide IR group 
versus 21.2% in the placebo group). Improvements from baseline in the individual abdominal 
symptoms (abdominal bloating, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal pain) and in the 
abdominal score ( a multi-component score based on these individual abdominal symptoms ) were 
seen in the linaclotide IR group compared with the placebo group.

 Linaclotide IR was well-tolerated in this study and safety results were consistent with the known 
safety profile of linaclotide. Ther e were no deaths in the study. Two patients reported on-
treatment SAEs: 1 placebo patient (pneumonia and sepsis) and 1 linaclotide IR patient (gastroenteritis); all [ADDRESS_925795] common TEAE was diarrhea (13.6% in the linaclotide IR 
group versus 1.5% in the placebo group). All d iarrhea events were mild or moderate in severity . 
Diarrhea resulted in the discontinuation of 6.1% of patients treated with linaclotide  IR and 0% of 
patients treated with placebo.

The Screening Period starts with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF; Appendix 1) 
and may last for up to 21 days. During this period, patient eligibility for entry into the 
Pretre atment Period will be determined. The end of the Screening Period coincides with the start 
of the Pretreatment Period. If the patient meets the entry criteria assessed at the Screening Visit 
and does not require a washout of prohibited medicines (see Appendix 2), the Screening Visit 
and Pretreatment Visit may be combined into one visit.  Screening

 [IP_ADDRESS] Pretreatment Period  
The Pretreatment Period is defined as the 14 to 21 days immediately before the Randomization 
Visit. During this period, patients will provide the following information in a handheld electronic 
diary (eDiary):  
• Daily Bowel Movement (BM) -related Symptom -severity Assessments on an event-driven 
basis (meaning these are assessments made at the time the event occurs)  
• Daily Abdominal Symptom- severity Assessments in an evening report  
• Weekly Patient Assessment of Constipation Severity 
• Weekly Patient Assessment of IBS Symptom Severity  
• Weekly Patient Assessment of Adequate Relief  
• Use of Bisacodyl or Other Laxatives, Suppositories, or Enemas on an event-driven basis 
 
Patients who satisfy all entry criteria will enter the Treatment Period.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Period  
The Treatment Period begins with treatment assignment and lasts for 12 weeks. Patients will be random ized to 1 of 2 treatme nts: linaclotide 290 µg or placebo (1:1) . Patients will take their 
initial dose of study drug at the trial center during the Randomization Visit, after fasting for [ADDRESS_925797]. Patients will continue to use the handheld eDiary to provide their Daily BM-
related and Abdominal Symptom- severity Assessments, weekly assessments ( as described above 
and including Weekly Patient Assessment of Treatment Satisfactio n), and Use of Bisacodyl or 
Other Laxatives, Suppositories, or Enemas. Other patient-reported outcomes assessments (IBS 
Quality of Life Questionnaire [IBS -QOL] and CDC Healthy Days Core Module [CDC 
HRQOL -4]) will be administered at trial visits throughout the Treatment Period. Patients will 
complete a Week 4 Visit , Week 8 Visit , and Week 12/End-of- Treatment -Period (ETP) Visit  
during the Treatment Period (see Schedule of Evaluations ).

 [IP_ADDRESS] Randomized Withdrawal (RW) Period 
The RW Period is defined as the 4 weeks immediately following the Treatment Period. Patients 
who complete the 12-week Treatment Period and return for the Week 12/ ETP Visit will enter the 
4-week RW Period and be allocated to study drug in a double-blind manner, as follows: 
• Patients randomized to linaclotide 290 µg during the Treatment Period will be rerandomized 
to linaclotide 290 µg or placebo (1:1) 
• Patients randomized to placebo during the Treatment Period will be allocated to linaclotide 
[ADDRESS_925798] dose of study drug  in the RW Period the day after  the Week 12/ ETP 
Visit (this will be considered RW Day 1). As during the Treatment Period, study drug will be 
taken once daily in the morning at least [ADDRESS_925799]. Patients will continue to use 
the handheld eD iary to provide their daily assessments, weekly assessments, and laxative use. 
Other patient -reported outcomes will be administered at the trial visit during the RW Period. At 
the end of the RW Period, patients will complete the Week 16/End-of- Trial (EOT) Visit.  
5.2 RATIONALE FOR TRIAL  DESIGN AND CONTROL GROUP  
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial design was chosen in accordance with the concepts in ICH E10, Choice of Control Groups and Related Issues in Clinical Trials, in 
order to provide comparable treatment groups and minimal chance of selection or investigator 
bias. The trial has a 14 -21 day Pretreatment Period to establish a baseline without therapy and to 
familiarize patients with data collection methodolog y (ie, eDiary), a [ADDRESS_925800] treatment to a placebo control , and a 4- week RW Period to determine if a 
rebound (or worsening of symptoms from baseline) or other withdrawal effects might occur after linaclotide treatment has  been withdrawn.

6.3 DISCONTINUATION OF PATIENTS FROM THERAPY OR 
ASSESSMENT  
A premature discontinuation will occur when a patient who signed the ICF ceases participation 
in the trial, regardless of circumstances, before the completion of the protocol. Patients can 
prematurely discontinue or be prematurely discontinued by [CONTACT_683704]:  
• Failure to meet Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria ( Screening or Pretreatment Failure)  
• Adverse event (AE)  
• Lack of efficacy  
• Protocol violation 
• Non-compliance with study drug 
• With drawal of consent 
• Lost to follow- up (every effort must be made to contact [CONTACT_102]; a certified letter must be

 Patients who are randomized but do not complete the Treatment Period or RW Period (withdraw 
consent or are discontinued before they have completed 12 weeks or 4 weeks of treatment , 
respectively ) will be considered Treatment Period or RW Period withdrawals , respectively,  and 
should complete the procedures required at the Week 16/EOT Visit (even if out of window) at 
the time of their discontinuation. The reasons for premature discontinuation from the trial will be documented on the study termination form of the eCRF. All data on the patient prior to 
discontinuation will be made available to Ironwood (or designee). Any patient who withdraws 
because of an AE will be followed until the AE resolves, stabilizes, or can be explained as being 
unrelated to study drug. The trial centers should make a reasonable effort to follow pregnant 
patients until delivery or end of the pregnancy. 
If a patient does not return for a scheduled termination visit (EOT Visit), the trial center should 
contact [CONTACT_102]. Every effort is to be made to contact [CONTACT_102], including sending a cer tified 
letter. In every case, the patient outcome, including lost to follow-up information, will be documented. 
The investigator may allow a patient to stop taking study drug for up to [ADDRESS_925808] the

 Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomized into the trial at the Randomization Visit on Day 1. Approximately 600 patients will 
be randomized to 1 of 2 treatments : linaclotide 290 µg or placebo (1:1).  Patients who complete 
the Treatment Period will enter the RW Period and be allocated to study drug as follows. 
• Patients randomized to linaclotide 290 µg during the Treatment Period will be rerandomized 
to linaclotide 290 µg or placebo (1:1) 
• Patients randomized to placebo during the Treatment Period will be allocated to linaclotide 290 µg  
 
Randomization numbers will be assigned by [CONTACT_166848] (IWRS).  
7.4 SELECTION OF DOSAGE IN THE STUDY 
The 290- µg dose of linaclotide was selected for this Phase 3b trial to further evaluate the efficacy 
of the FDA-approved dose of lina clotide on abdominal symptoms (abdominal bloating, 
abdominal discomfort, and abdominal pain ) in IBS -C patients.  
7.5 SELECTION AND TIMING  OF DOSE FOR EACH PATIENT  
All study drug will be administered orally once daily. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria at 
the Screening and Pretreatment Visits will be randomized to treatment (as described in 
Section  7.3) at the Randomization Visit (randomization number assigned by [CONTACT_10966]) and 
dispens ed one bottle containing [ADDRESS_925811]. Patients will take their initial dose of study drug (one capsule) at the trial  center during the Randomization Visit; p atients must have fasted for at 
least 2 hours prior to arriving at the clinic for this visit. Patients will take study drug as usual in 
the morning before the Week 12/ ETP Visit. Patients will be instructed to return all unused study 
drug and bottles to the study center at the visits defined in the Schedule of Evaluations .

 At the Week 12/ ETP Visit, patients who have not withdrawn from the Treatment Period will be 
rerandomized by [CONTACT_8784] (as described in Section  7.3) and dispensed a bottle containing 
35 tablets of double-blind study drug for the RW Period. Treatment will be taken according to 
the dosing instructions for the Treatment Period. P atients will take their initial dose of study drug 
in the RW Period (1 tablet) on RW Day 1 (ie, the day after the Week 12/ ETP Visit). 
7.6 BLINDING  
The Sponsor study personnel, t he investigator and all other site  study personnel, and the patient  
will remain blinded to individual patient  treatment assignments throughout the trial. Specific 
designated personnel in the D rug S afety and Pharmacovigilance group at Ironwood may be 
unblinded to the treatment assignment of individual patient  for regulatory repor ting purposes. 
Patient randomization codes for the Treatment Period and for the RW Period will be generated 
by [CONTACT_683705] (an electronic version will be stored on a 
secure server). Th e Treatment Period randomization  list will identify each patient by 
[CONTACT_153890]’s corresponding treatment assignment. The RW Period list will be stratified by [CONTACT_683706], patient's rerandomization number, and the corresponding treatment assignment. The medication code list will be supplied by [CONTACT_683707]. 
In case of an emergency, the IWRS will be accessed to obtain the study drug assignment of a 
patient. Accessing the IWRS for emergency unblinding should be done only in an emergency 
that necessitates identifying the study drug for the welfare of the patient, and only after 
unsuccessfully attempting to contact [CONTACT_177006]. If the blind is broken, the 
trial center will notify the Ironwood contact (see the Study Identification  information in the 
Synopsis) immediately. An explanation for breaking the blind will be recorded on the relevant eCRF. Breaking the code at the trial center will disqualify the patient from further participation 
in the trial (refer to Section 6.3 for details regarding procedures and follow-up for patients who 
are discontinued from therapy).

 8. STUDY PROCEDURES  AND ASSESSMENTS  
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
8.1.1 Primary Efficacy Assessments  
The efficacy assessments that will be  used to determine the primary efficacy endpoint (Section 
10.4.1) are the daily patient assessments of abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and 
abdominal bloating at their worst (ie, the components of the abdominal score). 
Daily Patient Assessment of Abdominal Pain at its Worst  
Patient assessment of abdominal pain at its worst will be collected via a daily evening report in  
the eDiary. The rating of abdominal pain at its worst during the previous 24 hours on an 11-point 
NRS will be provided by [CONTACT_357872]: 
“How would you rate your worst  abdominal pain in the past 24 hours?” 
<eDiary presents N RS where 0 is anchored with “No abdominal pain” and 10 is anchored with 
“Worst possible abdominal pain”>  
Daily Patient Assessment of Abdominal Discomfort at its Worst  
Patient assessment of abdominal discomfort at its worst will be collected via a daily eve ning 
report in the eDiary. The rating of abdominal discomfort at its worst during the previous 
24 hours on an 11-point NRS will be provided by [CONTACT_357872]: 
“How would you rate your worst  abdominal discomfort in the past 24 hours?”

8.1.[ADDRESS_925815] , as described in Section 8.1.1. 
8.1.3 Additional Efficacy Assessments  
In addition to the primary/ secondary efficacy assessments, the following efficacy assessments 
are used in determining the additional efficacy endpoints. 
Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement  
The CSBM assessment is based on the eDiary questions that determine whether a BM is a CSBM : 
• BM D ay and Time 
Patients will report BMs on an event-driven basis. An evening report will ask whether the 
patient entered all BMs for that day, and collect BMs not previously entered for that day.  
• Association with a Sense of Compl ete E vacuation  
This is assessed by [CONTACT_683709]:  
“Did you feel like you completely emptied your bowels after your bowel movement?” 
1=Yes  
2=No  
• Day of A ny Laxative Use 
Patients will report use of bisacodyl o r other laxatives, suppositories, or enemas on an event-
driven basis. An evening report will ask whether the patient entered all laxative use for that day, and collect bisacodyl or other laxatives, suppositories, or enemas not previously entered for that d ay.

Clinical Trial Protocol: MCP -103-312  26 March 2018  
 
Confidential  Page 55 of 118 
 Each day of the Pretreatment, Treatment, and RW Periods, the patient will complete eDiary 
entries on an event -driven basis to report BMs, and whether the BM was associated with a sense 
of complete evacuation. (The patient is also asked to provide assessments of stool consistency and straining, which are described below .) The patient will also complete eDiary entries on an 
event -driven basis to report use of protocol-permitted bisacodyl (tablets or suppositories) or other 
laxatives, suppositories, or enemas to treat their symptoms. Patients will complete a daily 
evening report to enter any BMs and laxative usage not previously reported by [CONTACT_683710] (recall is limited to 24 hours or to the time of the previous evening’s report). 
Spontaneous Bowel Movement  
The SBM assessment is based on the eDiary questions (described above) that determine whether 
a BM is an SBM:  
• BM day and time 
• Day of A ny Laxative Use  
 
Stool Consistency (BSFS)  
Patient assessment of stool consistency will be collected using two questions by [CONTACT_683711] -driven basis (ie, for each BM reported in the eDiary) . 
For each BM, the patient assesses his/her stool using the BSFS ( Appendix 4) which depi[INVESTIGATOR_683689]. The patient assigns a 
corresponding score for each BM. The BSFS is a well -accepted and widely -used measurement of 
stool consistency.( 14) The 7-point ordinal BSFS is provided below (see Appendix 4 for full scale 
including pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]) : 
“Please describe the form of your stool using the following scale where:” 
1=Separate hard lumps like nuts (difficult to pass)

The patient  also assesses his/her stool using a 5 -point ordinal scale described below. 
Straining  
Patient assessment of straining will be collected by [CONTACT_357880]-driven basis (ie, for 
each BM reported in the eDiary) . For each BM, d egree of straining will be assessed by [CONTACT_683712] 5-point ordinal scale: 
“How much did you strain during your bowel movement?” 
1=Not at all  
2=A little (mild straining)  
3=A fair amount (moderate straining)  
4=A large amount (severe strai ning) 
5=An extreme amount (extremely severe straining)  
 
Stool Consistency (5 -point ordinal scale)  
In addition to the patient assessment of stool consistency using the BSFS (described above ), 
patients will also assess s tool consistency by [CONTACT_683713]-driven basis using a 
5-point ordinal scale: 
“How would you describe the consistency of your stool?”

Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_357885] (discussed herein), standard clinical laboratory 
assessments, vital signs, physical examinations, and medical history. Planned timepoints for all 
safety assessments are provided in the Schedule of Evaluations . 
8.2.1 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug- related.  
An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Note:  A procedure is not an AE, but the reason for a procedure may be an AE. 
Serious Adverse Event 
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes: 
• Death 
• Life-threatening  experience: An AE is considered "life- threatening" if , in the view of either 
the investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]: AEs requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208349] 24 hours in duration do not meet this criterion. A 
scheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition that has not worsened during participation in the trial does not meet this criterion. Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208350]/surgical procedure or routine check -ups do not meet this criterion. 
Linaclotide   Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: MCP -103-312  26 March 2018  
 
Confidential  Page 61 of 118 
 • Persistent or significant disability or incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct norma l life functions  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is considered to be an  important medical event : Important medical events  that may not result 
in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], 
based upon appropri ate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Treatment -emergent Adverse Event 
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is an event that emerges, or a preexisting event that worsens, 
any time after administration of the first dose of study drug (Day 1).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Classification of an Adverse Event  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Severity  
The investigator or delegated physician will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE by 
[CONTACT_44745] a severity rating in the patient’s source documentation and on the AE page  of the 
patient’s eCRF. Severity, which is a description of the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is 
distinct from seriousness, which implies a patient outcome or AE- required t reatment measure 
associated with a threat to life or functionality. Severity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
Mild : A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living.  
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort, but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant.  
Linaclotide   Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: MCP -103-312  26 March 2018  
 
Confidential  Page 62 of 118 
 Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
AEs should be recorded using the maximum intensity of the event (eg, if a subject reported nausea lasting 3 days, one start date and stop date should be recorded along with the maximum 
intensity experienced for that event over that 3- day timeframe).  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_925818] assess the relationship of each AE (including SAEs) to the use of a study 
drug using a 2- category scale (not related or related) based on clin ical judgment and using all 
available information, and may include consideration of the following factors: 
• Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, preexisting 
conditions, concomitant use of other drugs, and presence of environmental or genetic factors 
• The temporal association between drug exposure and onset of the AE 
• Whether the manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity of the investigational product 
• Whether the AE resolved or improved with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_357828]; judgment should be used if multiple products are discontinued at the same time 
 
The causality assessment must be recorded in the patient’s source documentation and on the AE 
page of the patient’s eCRF. The causal relationshi p between study drug and the AE will be 
assessed using the categories shown in Table 2.

 Table 2. Adverse Event Causality  
Category  Definition  
Not related  An AE is not associated with study m edication if:  
- Lack of a temporal relationship to study drug administration makes a 
causal relationship improbable (eg, the event did not occur within a reasonable time frame following administration of the study medication); and/or 
- Other causative factor(s ) (eg, a preexisting clinical condition, other 
concomitant treatments) more likely explain the occurrence of the event, and 
- The event did not improve with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_357829], and/or 
- The event did not recur upon re-exposure with investigational product 
Related  An AE is attributed to the study medication if:  
- A temporal relationship to study drug administration makes a causal relationship plausible (eg, the event occurred within a reasonable time frame following administration of study me dication); and/or 
- Other causative factor(s) (eg, the subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments) either do not explain the event or are less equally likely to have led to the occurrence of the event, or 
- The event improved with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_357829], and/or 
- The event recurred upon re-exposure with investigational product 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Laboratory Abnormalities  
The investigator will review clinical laboratory values for significance and consideration as an 
AE. All of the following laboratory abnormalities should be captured as AEs: 
• Any laboratory test result that meets criteria for an SAE  
• Any laboratory abnormality that results in discontinuation 
• Any laboratory abnormality that requires the patient to receive specific corrective therapy  
• Any laboratory abnormality that the investigator considers to be clinically significant  
 
Linaclotide   Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: MCP -103-312  26 March 2018  
 
Confidential  Page 64 of 118 
 Ongoing abnormal laboratory values/conditions that are being treated at baseline will be captured 
as an AE if the condition increases in severity and/or frequency during the course of the trial or if 
the condition requires more frequent treatment. If a patient  is treated for an abnormal laboratory 
value just before the Screening Visit, then the medical history should reflect the severity of the condition before treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures for Recording  Adverse Event s 
The investigator will record all AEs from the time informed consent is obtained until completion 
of trial participation (eg, early termination or Week 16/EOT Visit) . At each trial visit, the 
investigator will inquir e about the occurrence of  AEs/SAEs  since the last  visit.  
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of trial center  personnel during trial 
visits and interviews of a trial patient presenting for medical care, or upon review by a site  
monitor. All AEs including SAEs will be captured on the appropriate eCRF. Information to be 
collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, 
relationship to study drug  (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a 
diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution or stabilization. 
Any medical condition t hat is present at the time that the patient is screened and does not 
deteriorate (worsen in severity and/or frequency) should be recorded as Medical History and not 
as an AE. However, if the patient’s condition deteriorates at any time during the trial, it will be 
recorded as an AE.  AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and 
duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
Pretreatment AEs will be collected and captured in the patient’s  source documentation from the 
time the patient  signs the ICF until the patient  receives study drug. Pretreatment AEs in 
randomized patients  will additionally be entered on the AE page of the patient ’s eCRF.  
Laboratory abnormalities, changes in vital signs, and physical examination findings should be 
considered AEs and reported on the AE page of the patient's eCRF only if the investigator 
considers them clinically significant and/or they necessitate intervention.

using the SAE  Form within [ADDRESS_925819] Information 
Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
clinicalsafety@ironwoodphar ma.com 
Fax:  [PHONE_14240]  
 
The SAE Form, which is to be completed in English and signed by [CONTACT_093] (or designee), 
is to include as much information as possible, but at a minimum must contain the following: 
• SAE term  
• Serious criteria  
• Severity  
• Causality assessment  
• Narrative explaining the context of the SAE outcome 
 
If not all information on the SAE Form is available at the time of the initial report, follow -up 
SAE reports will be completed and submitted within the same reporting timelines as initial 
reports . 
The investigator or designee is required to follow SAEs until resolution regardless of whether the patients are still participating in the trial. Resolution is defined as:  
• Resolved with or without residual effects (sequelae) 
• A return to baseline for a preexisting condition 
• The investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event 
• Fatal outcome: If an autopsy is performed on a deceased patient , the autopsy report and death 
certificate must be provided to Ironwood as soon a s it is available.

All applicable expedited safety reports will be forwarded, by [CONTACT_357866], to the investigator. 
The investigator will inform Ironwood of any local regulatory or IRB requirements not covered 
by [CONTACT_357887]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Any female patient  who becomes pregnant while participating in the trial  will be withdrawn from 
the trial. Information on any pregnancies in female patients, or the female partner of a male patient , will 
be collected from the Screening Visit until the completion of the Week 16/EOT Visit. If the patient  or the female partner of a male patient  becomes  pregnant after receiving study drug 
during the course of trial, the investigator will collect and record the pregnancy information on 
the Pregnancy Reporting Form and submit it to Ironwood within 24 hours of learning of the 
pregnancy. (Note: If the female partner of a male patient  becomes pregnant, the investigator must 
attempt to obtain consent to collect pregnancy information [including status of the newborn, if applicable] before reporting information to Ironwood). If not all information on the Pregnanc y 
Reporting Form is available at the time of the initial report, follow -up Pregnancy Reporting 
Forms will be completed and submitted within 24 hours of becoming aware of new information. 
The investigator is required to attempt follow -up on the pregnancy until the completion of the 
pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and newborn will be forwarded to Ironwood 
within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware. Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 
6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.

The tests detailed below will be performed  (additional tests may be performed at any time during 
the trial as determined necessary by [CONTACT_357888]) : 
• Hematology: Absolute and differential white blood cell count, erythrocyte count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and red blood cell indices (mean 
corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) 
• Chemistry : Sodium, magnesium, potassium, calcium, chloride, glucose, blood urea 
nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bicarbonate, phosphate, cholesterol , and uric acid  
• Other: Urine drug screening (cocaine, barbiturates,  amphetamines, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], alcohol, and cannabinoids) (Screening Visit only). Clinical significance of a positive urine drug screen will be assessed by [CONTACT_093]; positive results for cocaine, barbiturates, and cannabinoids are exclusio nary.

Confidential  Page 68 of 118 
 • Pregnancy  test: Serum human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test (for women of 
childbearing potential only) should be conducted at the Screening Visit 
and Week 1 6/EOT Visit. A negative urine pregnancy test must be 
documented at the Randomization Vis it and the Week 12/ ETP Visit for 
the patient to be eligible for randomization and dosing with study drug. Positive results on the pregnancy test will exclude a patient from participating or continuing in the trial. 
 
The investigator must review each  laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the trial in the AE section of the eCRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. All laboratory tests with abnormal 
values considered cli nically significant during participation in the trial should be repeated until 
the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_97264]. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period

 8.2.4 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Evaluations , 
by [CONTACT_1720] a licensed health professional listed on Form FDA 1572. Any physical 
examination abnormality that the investigator considers to be potent ially clinically significant 
and changed from the baseline will be reported as an AE. A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessment of the general appearance of the patient  and the HEENT 
(head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat), cardia c, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, 
neurological, and dermatological systems. Height (only at screening) and weight will also be 
measured and recorded. 
A rectal examination should be performed during the Screening Period in all patients who do not 
require a colonoscopy (refer to Appendix 3). After the Screening Period, the rectal examination 
is optional and may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. For all physical 
examinations, the breast and genitourinary examinations are optional and may be performed at 
the discretion of the investigator.

 9. DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
9.1 DATA MONITORING  
Before any patient enters the trial, a representative of Iro nwood or its authorized designee will 
meet with the investigator and his/her staff to review the procedures to be followed while 
conducting the trial and to train them on recording the data on the eCRFs using the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system.  
After  the first patient signs the ICF, the Ironwood representative, a site monitor, will periodically 
monitor the progress of the trial by [CONTACT_357889]. This site monitor will also be 
able to review the status of data queries remotely, possibly warranting more frequent 
communication with the investigator and his/her staff. The investigator will make available to the 
site monitor the computer that accesses the eCRFs during monitoring visits. The investigator and 
his/her staff will be responsible f or reviewing eCRFs, resolving data queries generated by [CONTACT_683720], providing missing or corrected data, approving all changes performed on 
his/her data, and endorsing the patient data within the EDC system. This approval method will 
include applying an electronic signature, which is a uniquely assigned username [CONTACT_211440] a traditional handwritten signature.

 10.3.2 Measurement of Treatment Compliance  
Dosing compliance for a specified period  is defined as the total number of capsules  actually 
taken by a patient during that period divided by [CONTACT_683724] , multiplied by 100. The total number of capsules actually taken will 
be calculated based on the following equation: total number of capsules dispensed – (number of 
capsules returned + number of capsules lost). The total number of capsules expected to be taken 
during a specified period  equals the number of days in the period. 
Descriptive statistics for study drug compliance for the Treatment Period o verall, and for each of 
the 3 consecutive 4 -week periods in  the Treatment Period (consistent with study drug 
dispensing) will be pr esented  for the Safety Population. Similarly, descriptive statistics for the 
RW Period will be presented for the RW Population. 
10.3.3 eDiary Compliance  
eDiary compliance will be based on the percentage of complete eDiary entries made by a patient. 
A complete eDiary entry is defined as one in which the patient responds to every eDiary question 
asked in the evening report on that day. The questions that are asked weekly will not be included 
in the determination of a complete entry.  
Descriptive statistics for eDiary compliance  (%) and the patients with ≥80%/<80% complete 
eDiary entries during the Pretreatment , Treatment , and RW Period s will be presented . 
10.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES  
All efficacy analyses to address the objectives of the trial will be based on the ITT Population for outcomes occurring during the Treatment Period. Additional exploratory analyses will be defined 
and clearly specified for the RW Period.

 Baseline values for efficacy parameters are derived from the eDiary and eCRF data collected in 
the Pretreatment Period, specifically, the period of time from 14 days prior to randomizatio n up 
to the time of randomization. Baseline values for patient symptom severity parameters (eg, abdominal symptoms [ pain, bloating, discomfort], constipation severity) will be the average of 
the non-missing severity scores reported during this period. The baseline CSBM and SBM weekly rates will be derived based on the number of CSBMs and SBMs a patient had during this 
period. Baseline BSFS score, stool consistency, and straining will be calculated as the average of 
the non- missing values associated with the  SBMs reported by [CONTACT_683725]. 
Trial  centers will be pooled together by [CONTACT_1617] (details to be provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan [SAP]). In lieu of trial center, geographic region will be used in 
analyses adjusting for center -to-center variability.  
Sensitivity analyses of the key endpoints will include, but are not limited to, a multiple imputation approach. If the normality assumption of the errors is violated for the key mixed 
model with repeated measures (MMRM) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analyses, ranked 
or other appropriate analyses will be applied. 
The overall family -wise Type I error rate for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be 
controlled at a two -sided 0.05 significance level.  
10.4.1 Primary Effica cy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is : 
• Change from Baseline in Abdominal Score  at Each Week  
A patient’s daily Abdominal Score is calculated as the average of the daily patient 
assessments of abdominal bloating at its worst, abdominal discomfort at its worst, and abdominal pain at its worst . If 2 or more of the individual daily abdominal symptoms are 
missing, then the Abdominal Score for that day will be missing. The weekly Abdominal Score is the average of the non -missin g Abdominal Scores during each week (Weeks 1-12) in 
the trial. The baseline Abdominal Score is the average of the non-missing Abdominal Scores during the 14- day Pretreatment Period  and the day of the Randomization Visit reported prior 
to randomization. Cha nge from baseline will be calculated for each week as the weekly score 
minus the baseline score.  
 
Linaclotide   Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: MCP -103-[ADDRESS_925831] to the change 
from baseline in abdominal score ove r the T reatment Period will be evaluated employing a 
mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) framework with week (categorical), treatment, geographic region, and week- by-treatment fixed effects, patient as the random effect, and 
baseline value as a covar iate. An unstructured covariance structure will be utilized. Descriptive 
statistics based on the MMRM model will include least- squares (LS) mean change from baseline 
for each treatment, the LS mean difference between linaclotide 290 µg and placebo, corresp onding 95% CIs, and the p-value associated with the comparison. 
10.4.3 Secondary  Efficacy Endpoint s 
The secondary efficacy endpoint s are: 
• Change from Baseline in 12-week Abdominal Score (Cumulative Distribution Function 
[CDF ]) 
Daily Abdominal Score is calculated as described for the primary endpoint in Section 10.4.1. 
The 12-week Abdominal Score is the average on the non-missing Abdominal Scores reported over the course of the Treatment Per iod. The baseline Abdominal Score is the average of the 
non-missing Abdominal Scores during the 14- day Pretreatment Period  and the day of the 
Randomization Visit reported prior to randomization. Change from baseline will be calculated as the 12 -week score minus the baseline score. 
• 6/12 Week Abdominal Score Responder 
A 6/[ADDRESS_925832] 2 points (ie, a -2 change from baseline)  in the 
respective weekly  abdominal score. If a patient did not enter information into the eDiary on 
at least 4 days for a particular Treatment Period week, the patient will not be considered a Weekly Abdominal Score Responder for that week. 
 
Linaclotide   Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: MCP -103-[ADDRESS_925833] with Hodges -Lehmann estimator for the median difference. 
A secondary time- course analysis of the Change from Baseline in Abdominal Score (see primary 
endpoint de finition in Section 10.4.1) will also be conducted. Using the MMRM frame work  
defined in the primary analyses, treatment difference between linaclotide 290 µg and placebo will be assessed at each individual week.  For each week, descriptive statistics based on the 
MMRM model will include the LS mean change from baseline for each treatment, the LS mean difference between linaclotide 290 µg and placebo, corresponding 95% CIs, and the p- value 
associated with the treat ment comparison. 
For the secondary responder endpoint, the proportion of responders in the linaclotide 290 µg 
group will be compared to the proportion of responders in the placebo group using a Cochran-
Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for geographic region. The number and percent of 
responders, the difference in responder rates between the linaclotide 290 µg and placebo groups, the odds ratio relative to placebo, all corresponding 95% CIs, and the p- value associated with the 
CMH test will be presented . 
10.4.5 Controlling for Multiplicity  
The overall family -wise Type I error rate for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be 
controlled at the α=0.05 level by [CONTACT_18120] a fixed-sequence procedure as described below. Following the fixed -sequence procedu re, if the primary hypothesis between the placebo group 
and the linaclotide 290 µg group is statistically significant (α=0.05) in the ITT Population, then 
the primary objective of the trial will have been achieved and the next hypothesis can be tested; 
otherwise, testing will stop. The testing of each sequential hypothesis is conditional on all the 
previous hypotheses being rejected at the 0.05 level of significance. If a hypothesis is not 
rejected at the 0.05 level of significance, then all remaining hypot heses are deemed not 
statistically significant. All hypothesis testing will be two -sided.

Clinical Trial Protocol: MCP -103-[ADDRESS_925844] dose of double-blind study drug for the RW Period (up to [ADDRESS_925845] dose of double-blind study drug) will be considered a 
TEAE for the RW Period if it was not present prior to the date of first dose of study drug for the 
Treatment Period, or was present prior to the to the date of the first dose for the Treatment Period 
but increased in severity on or after the date of the first dose for the RW Period. 
An AE that occurs on or after the date of the first day of dosing in the RW Period (up to [ADDRESS_925846] dose of double-blind study drug) will be considered a newly -emergent adverse 
event (NEAE) for the RW Period if it was not present prior to the date of the first calendar day of dosing in the RW Period, or was present prior to the date of the first calendar day of dosing in 
the RW Period, but increased in severity on or after the date of the first calendar day of dosing in 
the RW Period. 
If more than one AE is reported prior to the first dose of double-blind study drug and coded to 
the same preferred term, the AE with the greatest severity will be used as the benchmark for 
comparison with the AEs occurring during the Treatment and RW Period s that were also coded 
to that preferred term. An AE that occurs more than [ADDRESS_925847] dose of double-blind 
study drug will not be counted as a TEAE or NEAE . 
For the Treatment and RW Period s, the number and percentage of patients reporting TEAEs in 
each treatment group and treatment sequence, respectively, will be tabulated by [CONTACT_70244] (SOC) and preferred term; by [CONTACT_2946], preferred term, and severity; and by [CONTACT_2946], preferred 
term, and relationship to study drug. If a patient has more than one TEAE coded to the same 
preferred term, the patient will be counted only once for t hat preferred term by [CONTACT_683733]. Similar tabulations 
will be presented for the number and percentage of patients reporting NEAEs in the RW Period 
by [CONTACT_19016].

period/ trial will be presented by [CONTACT_683739]. 
The number and percentage of patients with PCS post- baseline vital signs will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_683740] . A vital sign value will be considered PCS if it meets both the 
observed value criterion and the change from baseline value criterion. The criteria for PCS vital 
sign values will be detailed in the SAP. The percentages will be calculated relative to the number 
of patients with baseline values and at least [ADDRESS_925849]- baseline values. A listing of all AEs for patients with PCS vital sign values

10.7 INTERIM ANALYSIS  
No interim analysis is planned for this trial. 
10.8 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE  
The sample size of 600 patients ( 300 patients per treatment group) was chosen to ensure 
adequate power for testing the fixed -sequence procedure for the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints as defined in Section 10.4.5. 
The power calculations for the primary endpoint are based on the placebo and linaclotide 290 µg 
treatment groups from the Phase 3 trial LIN-MD-31. The patients in LIN- MD-31 are considered 
representative of the patient population for this tria l. Using a resampling with replacement- based 
simulation ( 1000 iterations) and controlling for multiplicity as outlined above, the trial will have 
>99% power to reject the primary endpoint and ~ 94% power to reject all primary and secondary 
hypotheses defined in the testing process.

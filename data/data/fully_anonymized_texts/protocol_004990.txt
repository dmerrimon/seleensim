1. ABSTRACT:
This is a prospective, controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_789284] 
(HFNC) therapy in infants 12 months or younger when compared to nasal O 2 for treatment of 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
2. PURPOSE OF STUDY: 
To test the effectiveness of High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) therapy in infants as a treatment 
for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and compare with current standard of care, nasal O 2
3. BACKGROUND: 
The current standard of care at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (CCHMC) for treating OSA in 
infants less than 6 months of age is by a continuous flow of oxygen by [CONTACT_21294][ 1]. This is 
generally referred to as nasal continuous positive airway pressure or NCPAP. A nasal cannula 
(NC) is used with oxygen at low flows (1/4 lpm up to 1 lpm ) to deliver supplemental oxygen to 
reduce oxygen desaturations associated with apneic epi[INVESTIGATOR_789285] a positive 
pressure flow to maintain an open airway. At the CCHMC sleep center, the titration of the lpm 
flow of oxygen is done during a clinical polysomnograhy (PSG) with continuous monitoring of 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_789286] 031. At Children’s Mercy Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (CMH) the titration of 
lpm flow oxygen is done during the clinical polysomnography with continuous monitoring of 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_789287] (Attachment 1).
High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) therapy is a non-invasive treatment providing respi[INVESTIGATOR_81407].  Over the last decade, HFNC has increasingly been used for oxygen delivery in 
neonatology departments, gradually replacing nasal continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP). Its use in pediatrics departments is more recent. HFNC is designed to administer a 
heated and humidified mixture of air or oxygen or a mixture of both at a flow higher than the 
patient’s inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10229]. There is currently no single, simple definition of high flow. In infants, it 
usually refers to a flow of >2 l/min and in children it is considered >6 l/min. High flow presents 
several advantages over conventional ‘low-flow’ oxygen therapy in terms of humidification, 
oxygenation, gas exchange, and breathing pattern[ 2].
Advantages of HFNC include providing a relative humidity of nearly 100% with the gas warmed 
to between 34°C and 37°C. Some research has shown this to improve mucociliary clearance. 
Another benefit of humidification is improved inspi[INVESTIGATOR_789288]. These resistances are thought to make up nearly 50% of 
the total resistance of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133]. Several studies have shown that a flow higher 
than the patient’s inspi[INVESTIGATOR_789289]-flow oxygen therapy 
or high-concentration oxygenation mask. This observation has been explained as the effect of a 
high flow on the oropharyngeal dead space, washing out oxygen depleted gas and reducing 
CO 2 rebreathing. The extrathoracic dead space is proportionally two to three times greater in 
children than in adults. It may measure up to 3 mL/kg in newborns and becomes similar to the 
Version 12JUN2018 Page 2 of 10adult volume only after 6 years of age (0.8 mL/kg). Consequently, the younger a child is, the 
greater the effect of a high flow on oxygenation and CO2 clearance[ 3]. 
Studies contrasting the delivered flow to the generated pressure as measured by [CONTACT_789299]- and intra-subject variability. 
The pressure is determined not only by [CONTACT_789300], but also by [CONTACT_789301]/nostril fit and 
whether or not the mouth is closed.   One study of infants with viral bronchiolitis suggested that 
a flow ≥ 7 l/min created positive pharyngeal pressures similar to CPAP. The positive pressures 
generated by [CONTACT_789302], which may be very pronounced in OSA, 
and HFNC can thereby [CONTACT_789303][INVESTIGATOR_789290][ 3]. 
Three rare incidents of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum with use of HFNC have been 
reported with the cause believed to be from increases in end expi[INVESTIGATOR_13962]. These 
incidents occurred on a 2-month old (bronchiolitis), a 22 month- old (post trauma and 
mechanical ventilation), and a 16 year old (post-anesthesia). Flow rates ranged from 6–20 L/min 
at the time of the complication. They all had significant hyperinflation at the time of the 
development of air leak. The risk of generating excessive pulmonary pressures in children with 
OSA is reduced because the patients are asleep; with shallower tidal breathing and heated 
humidified air to prevent bronchospasm. This risk will be further minimized in this study since all 
subjects will be directly monitored for respi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], effort, and gas exchange throughout the 
intervention [ 4, 5]. 
4. STUDY DESIGN: 
This is an interventional prospective controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_789291] 12 months and younger to treat OSA.
The study intervention will occur for approximately 3 to 4 hours immediately prior to a scheduled 
clinical polysomnography (PSG). Subjects will be prepared for standard clinical PSG and after 
asleep, the intervention will be titration of room air at different pressure flows delivered by 
[CONTACT_789304]. At the end of the research portion of the PSG, the clinical PSG will 
begin with the standard of care treatment, the nasal O 2 titration for OSA. The results of the 
clinical PSG will serve as control comparison for the research intervention. 
5. DURATION: 
For outpatients, the duration of the study for subjects will be about 1 month and involve 2 visits 
that will be incorporated into a clinical visit and a clinical PSG (polysomnography). For 
inpatients, the duration of the study for the subject will be 1 night with a clinical PSG 
(polysomnography).
The duration of the study will be about 12 months with an additional 12 months for analysis. 
6. SELECTION & RECRUITMENT OF PARTICIPANTS: 
A. Number of participants
We will recruit about 10 subjects.
B. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria
Inclusion
Infants ≤ 12 months
Diagnosis of OSA from previous PSG
Version 12JUN2018 Page 3 of 10Exclusion
Infants who on previous PSG had central apneas > 50% of the AHI (apnea 
hypopnea index)
Version 12JUN2018 Page 4 of 10D. Recruitment
At Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], participants will be recruited from the Pulmonary / 
Sleep Disorders Clinic and the inpatient pulmonary consults, including the Newborn 
Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Potential study participants will be identified by [CONTACT_789305] a member of the research team to discuss 
participation with the family about the research study. Eligibility based in inclusion 
exclusion criteria will be reviewed before contact[CONTACT_789306], willing and give parental permission for their infant to 
participate will be enrolled.  Any recruitment materials used will be submitted to the IRB 
for approval prior to use.
At Children’s Mercy Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], participants will be recruited from the Pulmonary and Sleep 
Disorders Program and the inpatient pulmonary consults, including the Newborn 
Intensive Care Unit.
E. Vulnerable Populations
Additional efforts will be made to protect this vulnerable population. Parents will be given 
clear explanations to define the research portion of the scheduled PSG from the clinical 
portion as the two will be scheduled on the same day. Parents will be given time to have 
their questions answered and will be informed that they can withdraw their infant at any 
point in the study.
7. PROCESS OF OBTAINING CONSENT: 
We are asking for a waiver of written HIPAA authorization to identify potential subjects by [CONTACT_789307]/exclusion criteria on the inpatient pulmonary consult team and 
pending clinic visits. Signed HIPAA authorization will be obtained at the time of written informed 
consent.
The parent will be given the consent for the study and it will be reviewed with the parent by a 
member of the research team and time given for questions.  The parent will sign the consent 
after all questions are answered and a signed copy of the consent form will be given to the 
parent to keep.  The parent will be informed that this research is voluntary and that they are able 
to withdraw their infant at any time.  No study related procedures will be done prior to consent 
being signed.
For non-English speaking subjects:
At CCHMC, non-English speaking participants will be consented using a short form consent 
process as per CCHMC SOP 41-1.8. The approved long consent form will serve as the 
summary of the research. At CMH, non-English speaking participants will be consented using a 
short form consent process as per CMH guidelines.

PSG Visit: 
Approximately 3 to 4 hours prior to a scheduled clinical polysomnography (PSG), subjects will 
be prepared for the research portion of the PSG. The following parameters will be recorded:
Electroencephalogram; right and left electro-oculogram; submental, tibial and intercostal 
electromyogram 
Electrocardiography (ECG) 
Nasal/oral airflow and through nasal pressure and thermal sensors; transcutaneous CO 2 
(TCO 2); oxygen saturation by [CONTACT_7852]; oximeter pulse waveform 
Snore sensor

Rib cage and abdominal volume changes will be recorded with a computer-assisted 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_789292], the titration procedure will occur in a step like manner with room air delivered by 
[CONTACT_789304]. Subjects will be continuously monitored by [CONTACT_789308][INVESTIGATOR_46175].
Titration will begin with flow of room air at 6 l/min for [ADDRESS_1086980] obstructive respi[INVESTIGATOR_789293]-established criteria listed in the study SOP, then titration will continue.
Room air will be increased by [CONTACT_122271] 2 l/min for 30 minutes to a maximum flow of 15 
l/min after returning to sleep until the obstructive events have resolved or until not tolerated. 
If a subject does not tolerate a titration, they will be dropped and maintained at the last tolerated 
flow for the remainder of the 3 hour PSG period (from start of 6 l/min titration) or a minimum of

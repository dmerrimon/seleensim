Protocol LVM-MD-[ADDRESS_852873] the 
following changes:
1. During the COVID-19 pandemic, remote study visits are possible to avoid 
missing efficacy data but are not preferred over clinic visits. 
2. Considering the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the benefit and 
risk to patients participating in this study has been re-evaluated. Based on the limited information to date, no additional risk to study participants is anticipated with the use of the investigational product.
3. Updated Section 9.7.8 (Interim Analysis) to reflect that the interim futility 
analysis has now been performed, after 62% of randomized patients completed or discontinued the study.
Remote Study Visits :
Investigators/appropriately designated study staff will be allowed to perform selected study procedures as remote study assessments (eg, conducted via phone, video conference) if participants are unable to attend in-person due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During these remote study visits, the supplemental Schedule of Visits and Procedures for 
Remote Study Visits below should be followed and documented that the visit was 
conducted remotely due to COVID-19 pandemic issues.
Safety Assessments: 
Safety assessments permitted to be completed remotely include assessment of adverse 
events and concomitant medications. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) may be performed remotely, and any positive results will be reviewed with an Investigator-delegated clinician to ensure the participant is not at risk for suicide. Lab draws (PK, pregnancy testing and safety labs), ECG, physical exam and vital signs will need to be collected by [CONTACT_637954] 
a deviation if it is not possible to collect these data.
Efficacy Assessments:
Due to the nature of the participant CDRS-R assessment, the interview may be performed 
remotely provided that the participant has access to a videoconferencing platform where the rating clinician can visually see the participant during the discussion. The parent/caregiver CDRS-R interview may be conducted via phone or videoconferencing.
Study Medication Dispensation for Remote Study Visits:
If it is necessary to conduct any part of a visit remotely, resulting in Study Medication not 
being able to be dispensed to the patient at the study site, the option to have study medication delivered by [CONTACT_637955]-to-patient (DTP) may be possible. Approval by [CONTACT_637956].
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-[ADDRESS_852874] the following 
changes:
1. Clarification that pharmacokinetic samples will only be collected in patients aged 
7 to 11 years old.
2. Clarification that participants from Study LVM-MD-11 are excluded from 
participating in this study.
3.Updated exclusion item #[ADDRESS_852875] the term “mental retardation” with “intellectual disability” per the category in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders , 5th Edition.
4. Added interim futility analysis for when approximately 50% of randomized 
patients have either completed or discontinued the study.

CLINICAL STUDY SYNOPSIS: Study LVM-MD-14
Title of StudyA Double-blind, Placebo- and Active-controlled Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Levomilnacipran ER in Pediatric Patients7-17 Years With Major Depressive Disorder 
Study Centers Approximately 60 study centers
Development Phase 3
ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of levomilnacipran compared with placebo in pediatric outpatients (7-17 years) with major depressive disorder (MDD). 
In addition, the study is designed to obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) data 
to define the PK
profile of levomilnacipran in the pediatric population 
(7-17 years of age).
MethodologyMulticenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-
controlled, flexible-dose, parallel group study
During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, remote 
study visits were implemented and will continue to be possible to avoid missing efficacy but are not preferred over clinic visits. The study center needs to alert the Sponsor, ahead of time when possible, that a remote procedure was performed.
Number of Patients 480 planned (160 placebo, 160 levomilnacipran, and 160 fluoxetine) 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for InclusionMale and female outpatients, 7 to 17 years of age (inclusive), who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th
Edition (DSM-5) criteria for MDD; have a score of  ≥ 40 on the 
Children’s Depression Rating Scale–Revised (CDRS-R) at Visits 1 and 2, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score ≥ 4 at 
Visits 1 and 2. The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders–Present and Lifetime (K-SADS–PL) will be used to confirm the diagnosis of MDD and to document the patient’s psychiatric history.
Test Product, Dosage, and Mode of AdministrationEncapsulated levomilnacipran extended-release (ER) 10 mg(nontrade), 20 mg, and 40 mg capsules; once-daily oral administration, at the same time each day
Duration of Study!10 weeks in duration: 1-week screening/washout period, followed by [CONTACT_1629] 8-week double-blind treatment period and a 1-week double-blind down-taper period
Reference Therapy, Dosage, and 
Mode of AdministrationPlacebo capsules, once-daily oral administration, at the same time 
each day
Encapsulated fluoxetine 10 mg capsules and encapsulated fluoxetine 
20 mg capsules; once-daily oral administration, at the same time each day
Criteria for Evaluation
Primary Outcome Measure CDRS-R change from baseline at Week 8
Secondary Outcome Measure CGI-S change from baseline at Week 8
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 6
2020Safety MeasuresAdverse event (AE) recording, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements including height and weight, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, and Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)
Pharmacokinetic AnalysisThe population PK of levomilnacipran will be characterized using plasma concentration-time data. The maximum plasma drug 
concentration, area under the curve, time of maximum plasma 
concentration, half-life, apparent oral clearance and/or apparent volume of distribution for levomilnacipran ER will be estimated and a summary will be reported.
Statistical MethodsThe primary efficacy parameter is the change from baseline to end of Week 8 of the double-blind treatment period in the CDRS-R total score.
The primary analysis will be performed using a mixed-effects model 
for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment group, study center, 
visit, and treatment group–by-visit interaction as the fixed effects and the baseline value and baseline value–by-visit interaction as the covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the covariance of within-patient scores. This analysis will be performed based on all postbaseline scores using only the observed 
cases without imputation of missing values.
The secondary efficacy parameter is the change from baseline to end 
of Week [ADDRESS_852876]. Efficacy analyses will be performed using the 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population, defined as all patients in the Safety 
Population who had the baseline and at least 1 postbaseline 
assessment of CDRS-R total score.
Population PK parameters will be estimated using nonlinear 
mixed-effects modeling methods. The study will be prospectively powered to target a 95% confidence interval within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimates of clearance and volume of distribution for levomilnacipran ER, with at least 80% power.

[ZIP_CODE].0 INTRODUCTION
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and serious illness in children and 
adolescents. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_637937] 1%-2% of prepubertal children, and between 3% and 8% of adolescents ( Zalsman 2006 ). By [CONTACT_15317] 10 to 15, girls appear to be more likely to 
experience depression than boys ( Angold 1998).
MDD is commonly associated with feelings of worthlessness, low self-esteem, and thoughts of suicide and its psychosocial burden in the formative years can compromise the developmental process. Patients also experience difficulties with concentration and motivation, impairing functioning in this critical period. Each year as many as 20% of adolescents have suicidal ideation and 9% attempt suicide ( Grunbaum JA 2002). Suicide 
is a leading cause of death in adolescents and is a major public health concern (CDC 2014). A major risk factor for suicide in adolescents is major depression.
MDD in children and adolescents can be chronic and recurrent. The mean length of pediatric depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_637938] [ADDRESS_852897] epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], up to 40% of patients appear to recover without specific treatment. However, patients who do not recover appear to be at high risk of chronic depression, and those who do recover have high rates of recurrence and dysthymia (Zalsman 2006).
As a pharmacological treatment, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) for children and adults increased approximately 7-fold during the 1990s. Fluoxetine (Prozac
®), an SSRI, is approved by [CONTACT_637959] 8 years and older. Escitalopram (Lexapro®), another SSRI, is 
approved for the treatment of MDD in patients aged 12 and over. Currently, no serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] (SNRIs) have been approved for the treatment of MDD in children or adolescents.
Levomilnacipran is an SNRI approved for the treatment of MDD in adults in the United 
States. The pharmacologic mechanism of the antidepressant activity of levomilnacipran and other SNRIs (ie, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine) is thought to be mediated through inhibition of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (NE) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (5-HT) reuptake in the central nervous system. Although all SNRIs (as a class) block 5-HT and NE reuptake, currently marketed SNRIs (duloxetine, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine) are more potent inhibitors of 5-HT reuptake than of NE reuptake (Deecher 2006; Vaishnavi 2004). Levomilnacipran exhibits a distinct in vitro profile, 
exhibiting more potent inhibition of NE reuptake than 5-HT reuptake ( Auclair 2013 ). 
This greater potency at the NE transporter may confer additional improvements specifically in those domains associated with noradrenergic neurotransmission; for example: alertness, energy, attention, and anhedonia ( Montgomery and Briley, 2011 ).

2020The efficacy of levomilnacipran as measured by [CONTACT_57429]-Åsberg Depression 
Rating Scale total score was established in 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_637939]. Levomilnacipran also demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by[CONTACT_637960]. These studies, which were conducted in the [LOCATION_002] and Canada, were placebo-controlled; no active comparator was included. Two of the studies were fixed-dose studies (LVM-MD-01: placebo, levomilnacipran 40 mg/day, 80 mg/day, and 120 mg/day; and LVM-MD-10: placebo, levomilnacipran 40 and 80 mg/day) and 1 study wasflexible-dose (LVM-MD-03: placebo, levomilnacipran 40 mg/day to 120 mg/day).
In summary, MDD is a condition common in children and adolescents and is a major 
public health concern. Current approved treatment options for this condition are limited to the 2 aforementioned SSRI products. Since the modulation of energy, vigilance, and arousal can be directly linked to the noradrenergic system, it has been suggested that antidepressants with a prominent noradrenergic component, such as levomilnacipran, may be particularly effective in addressing functional impairment, decreased concentration, lassitude, mental and physical slowing, and decreased self-care (Citrome 2013 ). Brain serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_637940], however, and these maturational effects may generate age-related differences in patients’ responses to pharmacotherapy. Thus, it is important that further investigation of SNRI treatment options such as levomilnacipran be evaluated systematically for the treatment of MDD in children and adolescents, so that an SNRI’s efficacy and safety profile can be characterized in this population.
The current study of levomilnacipran extended release (ER) in pediatric patients 
(7-17 years old) with MDD will be conducted as required under the Pediatric Research Equity Act and as agreed upon with the FDA as a part of Postmarketing Requirement studies.

9.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: DESCRIPTION
Study LVM-MD-14 will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and 
active-controlled, flexible-dose, parallel group study in pediatric patients, ages 7-17 years. The study will be approximately 10 weeks in duration:
!1-week screening/washout period
!8-week double-blind treatment period 
!1-week double-blind down-taper period 
The screening/washout period will be generally 1 week (± 3 days) prior to Visit 2
(Baseline), but may be extended up to a total of [ADDRESS_852898] during the screening period. 
Patients who meet the eligibility criteria at Visit 2 (Baseline) will be randomized to 1 of 
3 treatment groups: placebo, levomilnacipran, or fluoxetine. See Section 9.4.[ADDRESS_852899] complete Visit 8/Early Termination (ET) Visit and, at the 
end of the down-taper period, return for Visit 9/Safety Follow-up (SFU) Visit. Patients who do not enter the down-taper period must return for Visit 9/SFU Visit approximately 1 week after Visit 8/ET Visit.
Approximately 480 patients (160 per treatment group) are planned to be randomized in 
the study.
Figure 9-1 provides a schematic of the study design. 
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic developed after this study began,
and this protocol has been amended to account for study procedures that may need to be modified in association with adhering to local guidelines or regulations or site flexibility to complete study-required procedures.

Protocol LVM-MD-[ADDRESS_852900] options will allow remote visits as outlined below:
!Option 1: In-clinic visits 
This is the preferred option. All study visits are performed as in clinic visits with all 
assessments outlined in the Schedule of Assessments in Section 2.0.
!Option 2: Remote visits (except screening) 
This option is only to be used if local guidance, regulations, or the needs of the patientprevent the site or the patient from completing on-site visit procedures. Screening visits must take place as an in-clinic visit with all assessments outlined in the schedule of assessments in Section 2.0. All other visit procedures (V2-V8) can be completed 
remotely with the assessments outlined in Section 2.1. The study center needs to alert the 
Sponsor, ahead of time when possible, that a remote procedure was performed.
For remote visits, there is an option to have study drug delivered by [CONTACT_637961].

9.4 TREATMENTS
Patients meeting the eligibility criteria at Visit 2 (Baseline) will be randomized in a 
double-blind fashion to 1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo, levomilnacipran, or fluoxetine.
9.4.1 Treatments Administered
At Visit 1 (Screening) and after consent/assent is obtained, patients will be given a 
placebo capsule to swallow to confirm their ability to swallow investigational product.
Investigational product in the form of over-encapsulated capsules will be packaged in 
blister cards and provided by [CONTACT_143657]. Patients will be supplied with blinded investigational product and will be instructed to take 2 capsules orally each morning (see Section 9.4.5
for details). Confirmation that dosing scheme (including titration and down-taper) and dosing instructions were discussed with the patient and caregiver, and that dosing instructions were provided will be recorded in the source documents.
9.4.[ADDRESS_852913] will be supplied by [CONTACT_637968] 10 mg capsules, trade levomilnacipran 20 mg capsules, trade levomilnacipran 40 mg capsules, fluoxetine 10 mg capsules, or fluoxetine 20 mg capsules packaged in blister cards.
The blister cards will contain sufficient numbers of doses for the interval of days between 
scheduled visits plus additional doses to accommodate visit scheduling. 
The blister cards will be labeled with the protocol number, storage information, warning 
language (viz, “Caution: New Drug—Limited by [CONTACT_12201]”), and instructions to take as directed. The Investigator will write the date, visit number, study week, and PID number on the label.
All investigational product will be provided and shipped to the study centers by [CONTACT_637969] (eg, a locked cabinet in a locked room) at room temperature (25°C or 77°F, with a permitted range of 15°C-30°C or 59°F-86°F), and must be protected from light, heat, and moisture.

At the end of the study, all unused investigational product and empty investigational product packages must be returned to the Sponsor at the address provided in the Study Reference Binder.
9.4.3 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups
After the patient, parent/guardian/LAR, and caregiver provide assent and sign the ICF at 
Visit 1 (Screening), study personnel will register the patient in the interactive Web response system (IWRS), and the system will assign the patient a sequential PID number. The first patient entered into the system at each site will be assigned the first number in the sequence by [CONTACT_1190]. This PID num ber will be used to identify the patient 
throughout the study (ie, at all study phases). 
The study center must contact [CONTACT_220141] (Visit 2) and all subsequent study 
visits in order to obtain the instructions on kit number for the investigational product to be dispensed to the patient at that visit. 
A detailed description of IWRS procedures is contained in the IWRS Site User Guide that 
should be stored in the Study Reference Binder.
9.4.4 Selection of Dosages in the Study
Doses of levomilnacipran in pediatric patients (7-17 years of age) were selected based on 
modeling of available PK data submitted with NDA 204,168 from the adult healthy volunteers and patients with MDD, as well as adolescent patients (12-17 years of age, LVM-MD-11, 2017) with MDD. Based on the results of modeling a common dosing scheme for both age groups of 7-11 and 12-17 years is appropriate. While the adolescent age group, 12-17 years of age, demonstrates similar plasma concentrations as adults administered the same dose of 80 mg/day, for the younger age group, 7-11 years of age, data indicate that equivalent concentrations are achieved with approximately a 33% dose reduction. Thus, 80 mg/day is expected to show exposure similar to exposures seen for the adult population administered 120 mg/day.
Based on the above findings, levomilnacipran 40 mg/day, with an optional increase to 
80 mg/day based on therapeutic response and tolerability, is appropriate for the pediatric 
patient age range (7-17 years of age). The corresponding plasma concentrations of these 
doses in pediatric patients are expected to remain within the plasma concentrations associated with the approved therapeutic dose range for adults.

Allergan Sales, LLC Page 37
[ZIP_CODE].4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient
All investigational products should be taken orally as a single dose, once-daily at the 
same time each day. After consent/assent is obtained, patients undergoing screening will 
be required to swallow a placebo capsule to confirm their ability to swallow the investigational product, as part of their eligibility assessment.
Patients who meet all eligibility criteria at Visit 1 (Screening) and who continue to meet 
all the eligibility criteria for participation in the study will be assigned a randomization number at Visit 2 (Baseline) and dispensed the corresponding blister card containing capsules of double-blind investigational product for Week 1. Patients will begin dosing with double-blind capsules on the next day. Patients will be instructed to take 2 capsules orally as a single dose, once daily at approximately the same time each day (morning dosing recommended), with or without food. 
Dosing may be switched from the morning to another time of day if a patient prefers or if 
tolerability issues arise. However, any switch must allow at least 20 hours between 2 consecutive doses. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening Period
At Visit 1 (Screening) after consent/assent is obtained, a placebo capsule will be administered for the purpose of eligibility determination. Patients will be given a placebo capsule to swallow. If a patient is unable to swallow the placebo capsule, the patient will be ineligible for study participation.
[IP_ADDRESS] Double-blind Treatment Period
The titration schedule is as follows:
!Levomilnacipran: Days 1-3, 10 mg/da y; Days 4-7, 20 mg/day; Week 2 through 
Week 8, 40 mg/day; Based on therapeutic response and tolerability, an additional 
dose increase to 80 mg/day is permitted at Week 3.
!Fluoxetine 20 mg/day (active comparator): Week 1, 10 mg/day; Week 2 throughWeek 8, 20 mg/day
Patients will be assigned a randomization number at Visit 2 (Baseline) and dispensed the corresponding blister card containing capsules of double-blind investigational product for Week 1. Patients will begin dosing with double-blind capsules on the next morning. Patients will be instructed to take 2 capsules from each column (1 each from Row A andRow B) as a single dose daily each morning with or without food. The double-blind dosing regimen is presented in Table 9-1 .

The IWRS will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. The study blind may be 
broken if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], it is in the patient’s best interest to know the study treatment assignment. The Sponsor must be notified before the blind is broken unless identification of the study treatment is required for a medical emergency in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study treatment will affect the immediate management of the patient’s condition. In this case, the Sponsor must be notified within [ADDRESS_852917] of concomitant medications that are allowed and not allowed for either epi[INVESTIGATOR_637942] . Medication history (psychotropic medication 
history during the previous [ADDRESS_852918] 12 months) will be recorded at Visit 1 (Screening) in the eCRF. Thereafter, any changes in concomitant medications or new medications added will be recorded in the eCRF.

[ZIP_CODE].5 EFFICACY AND SAFETY VARIABLES
9.5.1 Efficacy Assessments
The efficacy assessments will include the CDRS-R, CGI-S, and Clinician Global 
Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I). Efficacy assessments are not to be administered if the patient is not accompanied by [CONTACT_5657]/her consented caregiver. The K-SADS-PL and all efficacy assessments will be conducted by [CONTACT_637973].
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Assessment
The CDRS-R ( Appendix V ; Poznanski and Mokros 1996) is a semi-structured, 
clinician-rated instrument designed for use with children and adolescents between the ages of 6-[ADDRESS_852921] description of the patient and will then determine the total score.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Assessment
The CGI-S ( Appendix VI ; Guy 1976 ) is a clinician-rated scale used to rate the severity of 
the patient’s current state of mental illness compared with an MDD patient population. The patient will be rated on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 indicating a “normal, not at all ill” and 7 indicating “among the most extremely ill patients.” 
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Efficacy Assessment
The CGI-I is a clinician-rated instrument ( Appendix VII ). Based on the Investigator’s 
clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the total improvement or worsening of the patient’s mental illness is rated on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 being very much improved and 7 being very much worse, relative to Visit 2 (Baseline), regardless of whether the Investigator considers the worsening to be related to investigational product.

Protocol LVM-MD-[ADDRESS_852923] a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product (ICH-E2A).
For the purpose of data collection for this study, any untoward event that was reported 
from the time the patient signed the ICF until [ADDRESS_852924] dose of treatment is to be considered an AE.
Examples of AEs are as follows:
!Changes in the general condition of the patient
!Subjective symptoms offered by [CONTACT_44742]
!Objective signs observed by [CONTACT_637974]
!All diseases that occur after signing ICF, including any change in severity or 
frequency of preexisting disease
!Laboratory values that are deemed to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_737]
!Physical exam findings, including vital sign measurements, that are deemed to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_637975], but occurring during the study should not be captured as AEs, but should be listed in the medical history if related to a pre-existing condition.
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality Assessment
For each AE, the Investigator must provide an assessment of causal relationship to the investigational product. The causality assessment must be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF. Causal relationship must be assessed by [CONTACT_16134]:
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-[ADDRESS_852925] caused the event?
Yes: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational 
product and AE, ie:
oThere is a reasonable temporal relationship between the investigational product 
and the event, and/or 
oThe event is unlikely to be attributed to underlying/concurrent disease, other investigational products, or other factors, and/or
oPositive dechallenge and/or rechallenge exist
No: There is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
investigational product and AE, ie:
oThere is no reasonable temporal relationship between the investigational product and the event, or
oThe patient did not take the investigational product, or
oThe event is likely to be attributed to underlying/concurrent disease, other investigational products, or other factors, or
oThe event is commonly occurring in the (study) population independent of investigational product exposure
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity Assessment
The Investigator will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE by [CONTACT_44745] a severity rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF. Severity,
which is a description of the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from seriousness, which implies a patient outcome or AE-required treatment measure 
associated with a threat to life or functionality (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Severity will be assessed 
according to the following scale:
Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 43
2020Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
!Results in death
!Is life threatening
!Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of investigational product dependency or drug abuse.
Emergency room visits that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637943].
Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (eg, elective procedures for preexisting conditions that did 
not worsen, such as cosmetic surgery and hysterectomy) are excluded from SAE reporting.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
At each visit, patients are to be queried regarding any AEs or SAEs that have occurred since the previous visit. Patients will be asked to volunteer information with a nonleading question such as, “How do you feel since your last visit?” Study center personnel will record all pertinent information in the patient’s eCRF. 
In addition, any SAEs reported by [CONTACT_102] (or patient representative) or otherwise 
identified by [CONTACT_637976] (ie, after [ADDRESS_852926] dose) should be documented and reported.
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-[ADDRESS_852927] be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF 
whether or not they are considered causally related to the investigational product.
For every AE, the Investigator must:
!Provide an assessment of the seriousness of the event (ie, is it an SAE?), as well as 
the severity and causal relationship
!Document all actions taken with regard to the investigational product
!Detail any other treatment measures taken for the AE
!Document the outcome of the AE
In addition, patients and caregivers are to be reminded, as described in the ICF and in accordance with Section [IP_ADDRESS], to notify site personnel of any AEs occurring during the 
30-day poststudy period. Any AEs reported by [CONTACT_102] (or patient representative) during this period are to be recorded in original source documents. AEs are also to be recorded in the eCRF if at least one of the following conditions is met: 1) the event meetsthe criteria for an SAE (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS] ), and/or 2) the event is judged by 
[CONTACT_637977].
Any AEs that are ongoing at the time of the final protocol-defined study visit will be 
followed until the condition returns to prestudy status, has resolved or stabilized, or can be explained as being unrelated to the investigational product. If a follow-up visit is deemed necessary for appropriate safety surveillance, it will take place within 30 days of the final protocol-defined study visit.
[IP_ADDRESS] Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Events of 
Special Interest
AGN is required to inform worldwide regulatory authorities of SAEs that meet specific criteria. Therefore, AGN must be notified immediately regarding any SAE that occurs after informed consent is obtained.
Within [ADDRESS_852928] report the event to Global Drug Safety on the SAE Form for Clinical Trials. The Study Physician may also be notified by [CONTACT_756].
If, during follow-up, any nonserious AE worsens and eventually meets the criteria for an 
SAE, that AE should be recorded as a new SAE.

Study center personnel must report every pregnancy from the time the patient signs the ICF until [ADDRESS_852930] report the event to Global Drug Safety on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and fax it to the SAE/Pregnancy fax number stated in Section [IP_ADDRESS], even if no AE has occurred. Pregnancies in female partners of 
male patients occurring during the time frame described above must also be reported. 
The pregnancy must be followed to term and the outcome reported by [CONTACT_12550] a 
follow-up Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form. If the pregnancy is associated with an SAE (eg, if the mother is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143460]), a separate SAE Form for Clinical Trials must be filed as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] with the appropriate serious criterion 
(eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) indicated in addition to the Pregnancy Form.

Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is an instrument that reports the 
severity of both suicidal ideation and behavior. Suicidal ideation is classified on a 5-item scale: 1 (wish to be dead), 2 (nonspecific active suicidal thoughts), 3 (active suicidal ideation with any methods [not plan] without intent to act), 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan), and 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent). The C-SSRS also captures information about the intensity of ideation, specifically the frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for the most severe types of ideation. Suicidal behavior is classified on a 5-item scale: 0 (no suicidal behavior), 1 (preparatory acts or behavior), 2 (aborted attempt), 3 (interrupted attempt), and 4 (actual attempt). More than [ADDRESS_852936] recent attempts. 
The paper version of the C-SSRS will be completed at all study visits. At Visit 1
(Screening), the C-SSRS will be completed for the patient’s lifetime history of suicidal ideation and behavior ( Appendix VIII ). At all other visits, the C-SSRS will be completed 
for ideation and behavior since the previous visit ( Appendix IX ). The C-SSRS will be 
evaluated and signed at each visit by a qualified staff member (ie, the Investigator or designee that has extensive professional training and experience in assessing mental illness), before the patient leaves the study center.
The patient should not be released from the study center until the results of the C-SSRS 
are reviewed and the patient is not considered to be at risk. If there is doubt about whether a patient is at risk, the Investigator must obtain appropriate psychiatric consultation. The results of the C-SSRS will be recorded in the eCRF.

Protocol LVM-MD-[ADDRESS_852937] Concentration Measurements
PK blood samples will be collected from assented/consented patients aged 7-11 years to 
determine plasma concentrations of levomilnacipran. The blood sample will be 
processed, stored, and shipped as indicated in Appendix IV . The population PK of 
levomilnacipran will be characterized using serial and sparse plasma concentration-time data. The plasma concentration-time data collected will provide estimates of PK parameters, eg, area under the curve (AUC), half-life, maximum plasma drug concentration, and time of maximum plasma concentration.
Sparse PK blood samples will be collected during Visits 5, 6, and 7, as follows:
!Visit 5, at predose and at 1-4 hour postdose
!Visit 6, 4-6 hours postdose
!Visit 7, 6-8 hours postdose
In case of scheduling constraints and with prior notification of AGN, the sampling times 
above may be collected in a different sequence among specified visits.
From a subset of consented patients instead of sparse PK samples, 7 serial PK blood 
samples will be collected at Visit 5 (or at any 24-hour period between Visit 5 and Visit 7, inclusive) at the following time points: predose (20-[ADDRESS_852938] recent dose), and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10-12, and 24-hours postdose.
To allow for a predose sampling, patients may be instructed to hold their daily dose on 
the sampling day and take it when instructed at the study center.
PK samples will not be obtained from patients who missed investigational product dosing 
for 2 or more consecutive days before the sampling date.

9.6 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
9.6.1 Data Monitoring
Before any patient enters the study, a representative of AGN will meet with the 
Investigator and the study center staff to review the procedures to be followed during the study. Electronic data capture (EDC) functionality training is provided via computer-based training to train Investigators and authorized designees on recording the data in the eCRFs using the EDC system. After the first patient is enrolled, the AGNrepresentative, a Regional Site Manager (RSM) or designee, will periodically monitor the progress of the study by [CONTACT_143505]-site visits. This RSM or designee will review query statuses remotely, possibly warranting more frequent communication and/or site visits with the Investigator and the study center staff. The Investigator will make available to the RSM or designee source documents (written notes and electronic medical records, if used), signed consent forms, and all other study-related documents. The Investigator and the study center staff will be responsible for data entry of patient data into the eCRFs via the EDC system, resolving data queries generated via the EDC system, and providing missing or corrected data. The Investigator or designee will be responsible for approving all changes performed on the data, and endorsing the patient data within the EDC system. This approval method will include applying an electronic signature [CONTACT_153914] a uniquely assigned username [CONTACT_357926] a traditional handwritten signature [CONTACT_153916].
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-[ADDRESS_852946] access. Patient’s data are to be entered into the EDC system by [CONTACT_557949]. After data entry into the EDC system by [CONTACT_18370], a combination of manual and programmatic edit checks will be used to review the data for completeness, logic, and adherence to study protocol. As a result of these edits checks, data monitoring, and reviews, queries may be electronically issued to the site and should be answered electronically via the EDC system.
Each query will carry identifying information (assigned username, date, and time) to 
assist AGN and the Investigator on the origin of the data clarification request and the response provided by [CONTACT_737]. All data changes made to the patient’s data via a data query will be approved by [CONTACT_637982].
After all data have been reviewed and all issues have been resolved, the database will be 
locked.
All data collected in the context of this study will be stored and evaluated per regulatory 
requirements and applicable guidance for electronic records. Also, data will be stored and evaluated in such a way as to guarantee patient confidentiality in accordance with the legal stipulations applying to confidentiality of data. Study records (eg, copi[INVESTIGATOR_1495], laboratory reports, patient diaries, regulatory documents) will be retained at the site, along with adequate source documentation, according to FDA and ICH requirements. All study records must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_143657], its authorized representatives, and the FDA or other health authorities.
9.7 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE
9.7.1 Patient Populations
Four populations will be considered in the statistical analysis of the study as specified below.
[IP_ADDRESS] Screened Population
The Screened Population will consist of all patients who underwent a Screening Visit and received a screening number, and for whom informed consent was obtained.
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-[ADDRESS_852947] of all patients in the Screened Population who 
were randomized to a treatment group in the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Population
The Safety Population will consist of all patients in the Randomized Population who took at least [ADDRESS_852948].
[IP_ADDRESS] Intent-to-Treat Population
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population will consist of all patients in the Safety Population who had the baseline and at least 1 postbaseline assessment of the CDRS-R total score.
9.7.2 Patient Disposition
The number of patients in the Screened Population will be summarized overall by [CONTACT_441669]. The number of patients in the Randomized, Safety, and ITT Populations will be summarized by [CONTACT_143494]. Patients who were impacted by [CONTACT_25963]-19 pandemic (ie, had protocol deviations, missing safety assessments, AEs 
[as determined by [CONTACT_1697]], or withdrew from the study due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, or whose anxiety appeared to be affected by [CONTACT_47098]) will also be summarized.
Screen failures (ie, patients who were screened but not included in the Randomized 
Population) and the associated reasons for failure will be tabulated overall. Patients completing 8 weeks of double-blind treatment (Visits 2-8) will be considered completers. The number and percentage of patients who complete the double-blind treatment period and of patients who prematurely discontinue during the same period will be presented for each treatment group and pooled across treatment groups. The reasons for premature discontinuation from the double-blind treatment period as recorded on the dispositionpages of the eCRF will be summarized (number and percentage) by [CONTACT_281708]. 
The number and percentage of patients with important protocol deviations will be 
summarized overall and by [CONTACT_143496]. Deviations related to the following categories will be included:
!Inclusion or exclusion criteria
!Withdrawal criteria
!Treatment or dose
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 61
2020!Concomitant medications
These and any additional important protocol deviations will be reviewed and documented 
before database lock and unblinding of treatment codes.
Protocol deviations that occur due to COVID-19 will be summarized and listed 
separately.
9.7.3 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Demographic parameters (eg, age, race, ethnicity, sex, weight, height, body mass index) 
and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_637983]. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, minimum, median, and maximum) will be presented for continuous variables, and frequency distributions (counts and percentages) will be presented for categorical variables.
Prior medication is defined as any recorded medication taken before the date of the 
first dose of double-blind investigational product. Concomitant medication is defined as any recorded medication taken on or after the date of the first dose of double-blind investigational product. 
Both prior and concomitant medication use will be summarized by [CONTACT_637984]. Multiple medication use by a patient will only be counted once. Any recorded medications started after last dose of double-blind investigational product will not be summarized but will be included in listings.
9.7.4 Extent of Exposure and Treatment Compliance
[IP_ADDRESS] Extent of Exposure 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_852949] dose taken, inclusive. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, minimum, median, and maximum) will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].
In addition, weekly and overall mean daily dose of investigational product will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_143496].
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-[ADDRESS_852950] of the patient’s eCRF. 
The total number of capsules actually taken during a specific time period is calculated 
based on the study medication record. The number of capsules prescribed to be taken for a specific treatment period will be calculated by [CONTACT_637985].
Descriptive statistics for investigational product compliance will be presented by 
[CONTACT_557956] [ADDRESS_852951] nonmissing efficacy assessment recorded at or prior to Visit 2. All statistical tests will be 2-sided hypothesis tests performed at the 5% level of significance. All confidence intervals will be 2-sided 95% confidence intervals, unless stated otherwise.
For efficacy analyses in which study center is a factor, a small center will be defined as a 
center with less than [ADDRESS_852952] 2 ITT patients within the center. Pooling will be done using the following algorithm: 
Based on the number of ITT patients, small centers will be ordered from the largest to the 
smallest, and centers of the same size will be ordered from the largest center code to the smallest center code. The pooling process starts with the largest small center from the top, which will be pooled with the smallest from the bottom until a non-small center is formed. The process will be repeated using the small centers left out after the first pass. If any centers are left out at the end of the process, they will be pooled with the smallest pseudo center. If there is more than [ADDRESS_852953] center code will be selected.
By-visit analysis based on the mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
using the observed case approach will be performed for all continuous efficacyparameters.
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-[ADDRESS_852954] (LOCF) 
approach will be presented for all continuous efficacy parameters. For the LOCF approach, only the postbaseline total score of a parameter will be imputed using the LOCF approach; individual item scores will not be carried forward. Baseline total score will be carried forward only for the intermittent missing scores immediately after baseline. If all the postbaseline values are missing, the baseline value will not be carried forward.
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Parameter
The primary efficacy parameter is the change from baseline to end of Week 8 in the CDRS-R total score. The primary analysis will be performed using an MMRM with treatment group, study center, visit, and treatment group–by-visit interaction as the fixedeffects and the baseline value and baseline value-by-visit interaction as the covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the covariance of within-patient scores. The Kenward-Roger approximation ( Kenward and Roger, 1997 ) will be used to 
estimate denominator degrees of freedom. This analysis will be performed based on all postbaseline scores using only the observed cases without imputation of missing values. In the MMRM analysis, if the model fails to converge based on the unstructured covariance matrix, then structures of Heterogenous Toeplitz, Toeplitz, and Compound symmetry will be applied, only if necessary, in the specified order until the model converges.
In addition, [ADDRESS_852955]. Only the total score of a parameter will be imputed using the LOCF approach; individual item scores will not be carried forward.
In the other sensitivity analysis, a pattern-mixture model based on non-future dependent 
missing value restrictions ( Kenward 2003) will be performed to assess the robustness of 
the primary MMRM results to the possible violation of the missing-at–random missingness assumption. The non-future dependent missing value restriction states that the probability of drop-out at a specific visit can only depend on the observed value and the possibly missing value up to that visit, but not future values beyond that visit. The details of this sensitivity analyses are as follows:
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 64
2020The pattern for the pattern-mixture model will be defined by [CONTACT_102]’s last visit with 
observed value. The observed CDRS-R total score at a visit is assumed to have a linear relationship with the patient’s prior measurements. The dataset with missing values will be imputed under the assumption that the distribution of a missing observation differs from the observed only by a shift parameter value Δ. The dataset with missing values will 
be analyzed using the same model as the primary analysis for between-treatment group comparisons at Week 8. The imputation of missing values and the analysis will be performed multiple times and the inference of this sensitivity analysis will be based on the combined estimates using the standard multiple imputation technique. The values for Δ will be selected as 0 to 6 based on experience with historical data. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Parameter
The secondary efficacy parameter is the change from baseline to the end of Week 8 in CGI-S score. This parameter will be analyzed similarly to the primary efficacy parameter.
A sensitivity analysis will also be performed using the LOCF approach as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Efficacy Parameters
The additional efficacy parameters will include the following at each postbaseline visit:
!CGI-I score
!Change from baseline in CGI-S score
!CDRS-R response ( ≥ 40% reduction in CDRS-R from baseline) rate
!CDRS-R remission (CDRS-R ≤ 28) rate
CGI-I score and the change in CGI-S will be analyzed using the MMRM and LOCF 
approaches similar to those used for the primary efficacy parameter. For CGI-I score, the baseline CGI-S score will be used as the baseline variable.
The CDRS-R response rate and CDRS-R remission rate will be analyzed using a 
generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), based on logit link function, with random intercept and flexible terms of treatment group, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and baseline score. If the GLMM does not converge, a logistic regression model with treatment group and the baseline score as explanatory variables will be used. For the logistic regression analysis, the postbaseline missing data will be imputed using the LOCF approach.
Protocol LVM-MD-[ADDRESS_852956] will be used as the baseline for all analyses of that safety parameter. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
An AE (classified by [CONTACT_11702]) that occurs during the double-blind treatment period or during the double-blind down-taper treatment period will be considered a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) if it was not present before the date of the first dose of double-blind investigational product or was present before the date of the first dose of double-blind investigational product and increased in severity during the double-blind treatment period or during the double-blind down-taper period, respectively. If more than [ADDRESS_852957] will not be counted as a TEAE.
An AE occurring during the double-blind down-taper period will be considered a newly 
emergent AE if it was not present before the start of the double-blind down-taper period or was present before the start of the double-blind down-taper period but increased in severity during the double-blind down-taper period. The newly emergent AEs during the double-blind down-taper period will be summarized by [CONTACT_6764], preferred term, and treatment group.
The number and percentage of patients reporting TEAEs in each treatment group will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_6657]; by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and severity; and by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and causal relationship to the investigational product. If more than [ADDRESS_852958] will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].

double-blind treatment period will be summarized separately by [CONTACT_637986]. In addition, the incidence of fatal on-therapy SAEs (ie, events that caused death) will be summarized separately by [CONTACT_43732]. An SAE will be defined as an on-therapy SAE if it occurred on or after the date of the first dose of double-blind investigational product and within [ADDRESS_852959].
The incidence of SAEs and AEs leading to premature discontinuation of the study will 
also be summarized by [CONTACT_6960], system organ class, preferred term, and treatment group.
Listings will be presented for SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and death (if any).
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Parameters
Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory values (in SI units) and changes from the 
baseline values at each assessment time point will be presented by [CONTACT_143500].
The number and percentage of patients with potentially clinically significant (PCS) 
postbaseline clinical laboratory values will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]. The criteria for PCS laboratory values will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan. The percentages will be calculated relative to the number of patients with available non-PCS baseline values and at least [ADDRESS_852960] 1 PCS postbaseline value. A supportive listing of patients with PCS postbaseline values will be provided, including the PID number, study center number, and baseline and postbaseline values. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs
Descriptive statistics for vital signs (ie, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic BP, and body weight) and changes from baseline values at each visit and at end of study will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. In addition, height and weight z-scores will be calculated based on growth charts (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2).

2020Vital sign values will be PCS if they meet both the observed-value criteria and the change 
from baseline–value criteria. The criteria for PCS vital sign values will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan. The percentages will be calculated relative to the number of patients with baseline values and at least [ADDRESS_852961] 1 PCS postbaseline value. A supportive listing of patients with PCS postbaseline values will be provided, including the PID number, study center number, and baseline and postbaseline values. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram
Descriptive statistics for ECG parameters (ie, ventricular heart rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and QTc interval) and changes from baseline values at each assessment time point will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. The QTc interval is calculated using the Bazett and Frederica corrections.
The number and percentage of patients with PCS postbaseline ECG values will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]. The criteria for PCS ECG values will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan. The percentages will be calculated relative to the number of patients with available non-PCS baseline values and at least [ADDRESS_852962], will also be provided.
The number and percentage of patients with an increase > 30 msec but ≤ 60 msec, and 
with an increase > 60 msec in QTcF will be tabulated. A supportive listing of patients 
with postbaseline QTcF increases > 30 msec will be provided, including the PID number, study center, and all QTcF values (including changes from baseline). A listing of all AEs for patients with postbaseline QTcF increases > 30 msec will also be provided.

Growth Evaluation
Weight and height will be presented as standardized z-scores adjusted for gender and age, 
using the lambda-mu-sigma method ( Cole TJ 1990). To assess the impact of treatment on 
growth, the change from baseline in the age and gender adjusted height will be analyzed using an analysis of variance model with treatment as factor. A non-parametric (Wilcoxon) test will also be performed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Investigational Product Plasma Concentration Parameters
Plasma samples will be analyzed for the concentrations of levomilnacipran using validated bioanalytical methods. Population PK parameters will be estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling methods. The study will be prospectively powered to target a 95% confidence interval within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimates of clearance and volume of distribution for levomilnacipran ER, with at least 80% power.
9.7.7 Health Economics and Outcomes Research Analyses
Not applicable.
9.7.8 Interim Analysis
The interim analysis was conducted to iden tify early signs of futility after 62% of 
randomized patients had either completed or discontinued the study. The futility 
assessment of the primary efficacy parameter (CDRS-R total score) on ITT population was based on the conditional power as described in Lan et al. [ADDRESS_852964] similar efficacy as those of the existing patients of the same treatment group. The non-binding futility criteria was set when the conditional power for detecting a statistically significant treatment difference between the levomilnacipran treatment group

2020(40-80 mg/day) and placebo at the final analysis was 0.2 (20%) or lower given the 
interim analysis results. After the futility analysis results were reviewed by a data monitoring committee member, it was determined that this study will continue until the planned study end.
9.7.[ADDRESS_852965] size (treatment group difference relative to pooled SD) of 0.36 for both 
levomilnacipran and fluoxetine is based on a treatment difference of 4 units with a common pooled SD of 11.1 for the primary efficacy parameter, change from baseline to Week 8 in CDRS-R total score. A sample size of 480 patients (160 per treatment group) will be needed to provide 85% power for primary analysis (levomilnacipran vs placebo) based on an MMRM model using simulation method ( Lu 2012 ). The simulation assumed 
a correlation of 0.7 between the repeated measures and a dropout rate of 17% based on historical data in pediatric patients.

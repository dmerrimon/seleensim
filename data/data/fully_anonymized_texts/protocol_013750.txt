Version 11-9-[ADDRESS_1076497] er caused by a mutation in the factor IX 
gene, resulting in low circulating clotting factor levels which has been associated with trauma 
induced and spontaneous bleeding into the joint space. Recurrent bleeding leads to risk for re-bleeding, hypertrophy of the synovium, progressi ve cartilage destructions and bony changes, 
resulting in hemophilic arthropathy, chronic pain and functional disability [Forsyth 2012]. Prophylactic treatment with clotting factor concentrates to prevent bleeding has been shown to 
reduce the risk for joint arthopathy [Manco-Johnson 2007] and has become standard of care.  
Current prophylactic regimens, although very effective, do not completely prevent joint 
disease in a long-term perspective. Joint arthropathy in primary prophylaxis develops over many 
years, sometimes over a decade or even longer time periods. The ankle joints are the first and most severely affected joints in those patients  and thus may serve in outcome assessment as an 
indicator of early joint arthropathy when followed by [CONTACT_490244] [Oldenburg, 2015].

Pettersson score [Oldenburg, 2015]. 
Screening for hemophilic arthropathy is generally conducted during annual 
comprehensive visits in hemophili a treatment centers, and several tools have been developed to 
assess for and monitor progression of arthropath y. The Gilbert Score and the Hemophilia Joint 
Health Score (HJHS) are clinical scores. The World Federation of Hemophilia Pettersson score and Arnold-Hilgartner score are based on x-ray findings and tend to reflect later, irreversible 
bony damage. Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) is sensitive to soft tissue changes and detects pathologic findings such as effusions, synov ial hypertrophy, hemosiderin deposition, and

Version 11-9-[ADDRESS_1076498] been  developed over the years (Denver score is a 
progressive score, European score is an additive  score, Compatible score is a combined Denver 
and European score, IPSG score is currently the standard). While more sensitive for soft tissue 
changes, MRI is costly, not-easily assessable, takes a significant time commitment and 
necessitates sedation in children. Thus MRI is difficult to incorporate in the assessment of acute/bleeding and chronically changing joint. 
More recently, musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSKUS) has been used for diagnosis of joint 
disease in hemophilia. Like MRI, it can rev eal joint effusion, proliferation of synovium and 
subtle cartilage and bone abnormalities. It is the imaging modality recommended by [CONTACT_782793], especially when 
evaluating synovitis [Foltz 2012, McAlindon 2012, Porta 2012]. It has been demonstrated that 
ultrasound helps in the correct and timely diagnosis of acute bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] [Ceponis 2013], 
along with other musculoskeletal changes in pe ople with hemophilia [Kidder 2015]. Advantages 
of MSKUS are its wide availability and low cost. Ultrasound will allow more thorough 
longitudinal joint assessment [Aznar JA 2015], assisting in the prevention of disease progression, 
thereby [CONTACT_782794]. Soft-tissue changes such as synovial hypertrophy, which precede joint diseas e, especially can be effectively diagnosed. 
Standardized and simplified ultrasound scanning protocols for early arthropathy detection in 
ankles, knees, and elbows have been published [Martinoli 2013] 
Research Question 
Knowledge pertaining to the progression of hemophilic arthropathy of patients with 
Hemophilia B is limited since Hemophilia B is very rare. Only 1 in 25,000 live male birth is 
affected compared to patients with Hemophilia A, born at a ratio of 1:5000 male birth (ref). To 
date, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no prospective studies available to document the 
development of hemophilia arthropathy in patients  with Hemophilia B. We therefore propose to 
study longitudinal joint changes in patients with moderate and severe Hemophilia B. Most 
patients are on epi[INVESTIGATOR_782784], whereby [CONTACT_782795] a choice 
to be treated with newer extended half-life (EHL) products or to remain on traditional short-
acting FIX products. For example, recombinant FIX albumin fusion protein (rIX-FP) is the most 
recently approved EHL concentrate and has demonstrated an increase in circulating half-life and area of the curve (AUC) of greater than fourfol d versus unmodified FIX. When infused weekly 
this kinetic profile allows for potential trough levels of greater than 10% [Santagostino 2016]. 
Such improvement in minimum trough levels could improve the incomplete protection observed 
with previous products. This study will test the hypothesis that an EHL FIX product (such as rIX-FP) could offer better protection than previ ous treatment concentrates. The primary research 
question is whether EHL-rIX with an intended trough level of >5% will improve the outcome of 
joint health of elbow, ankle and knee joints as assessed with ultrasound assessment in severe 
hemophilia B patients.

Study Design 
Prospective, non-randomized controlled study, whereby [CONTACT_782796] 1 of 3 
groups depending on their current treatments as outl ined below. Patients will be assigned to a 
specific group by [CONTACT_15370]/PI [INVESTIGATOR_782785] 3 years.  
- Group A - epi[INVESTIGATOR_782786] 
- Group B - prophylaxis using  any FIX concentrate with an intended trough of 1-5% 
- Group C – prophylaxis with an extended half-life FIX with an intended trough of > 10% 
 
Primary Outcome 
Joint health status in all 3 groups as assessed by [CONTACT_782797] 3 years. 
Joint health will be assessed in all 6 major joints (elbows, knees and ankles), if possible, but at a 
minimum, target joints and the contra lateral joint will be included. During the exam the 
previously described Martinoli transducer positions will be used [Martinoli 2013]. To verify 
MSKUS, the first [ADDRESS_1076499] parallel x-rays and MRI of the target joint and contra 
lateral joint. 
Allocation of a comparison score of the MSKUS at baseline vs. year 3 will be done by a central, 
blinded person once all MSKUS images are available. The Joint Activity and Damage Exam 
(JADE) protocol will be documented to inform scoring. The scoring will be as follows:  
MSKUS Assessment Score 
MSKUS imaging indicated improved joint 
status (decreased signs of arthopathy)  -1 
MSKUS imaging indicated no change in joint 
status  0 
MSKUS imaging indicated worsened joint 
status (increased signs of arthopathy)  +1

Version 11-9-2016 Assessment at baseline and at annual exams : Patients will be consented and eligibility will be 
confirmed. The following will be collected: 
o Baseline Form (Demographics, bleeding history, use of hemostatic agents, past medical/surgical history, vital signs) 
o Rapid Assessment of Physical Function (RAPA – 1 page questionnaire) to assess physical activity level 
o Hemophilia Activity List (HAL – 3  page self –administered quest ionnaire) and Time up and go 
(TUG – assessed by [CONTACT_6214]) to assess function 
o VERITAS-Pro (24 question self-administered questionnaire) for A rm B and C to assess 
adherence to prophylaxis 
o Brief Pain Inventory (BPI – [ADDRESS_1076500] ionnaire) 
o Joint Assessment (Hemophilia Joint Health Score =HJHS) 
o MSKUS: Full J.A.D.E. Protocol (prior exams up to 3 months are p ermissible) 
o x-rays and MRI (first 10 patient only prior exams up to 3 month s are permissible)  
o Treatment Plan prescribed at visit 
o Labs: Factor XI level, FXI inhibitor, 
hsCPR  
o Plasma Sample for biomarkers for Bio Repository 
Historical assessments up to 1 year will be allowed as long as all required data was collected.  
Assessment of painful epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]: Patients participating in this study will be encouraged to come 
in for an assessment during a painful epi[INVESTIGATOR_782787], knees or ankles. They will 
be asked to classify the epi[INVESTIGATOR_146948] a bleed vs. non-bleed. The pertinent joint will be examined by 
a healthcare practitioner as classified to be  a bleed vs. non-bleed by [CONTACT_782798] a 
treatment will be determined according to the exam. The patient then will undergo MSKUS and 
the treatment plan will be reviewed. If changes are made based on the MSKUS finings, they will 
be noted. The patient is offered to have a sample for the biomarker repository drawn.  
Assessment post-painful epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]: Patients who came in for a painful epi[INVESTIGATOR_782788] 1-[ADDRESS_1076501] a

MSKUS Assessment: MSKUS will be  performed by a qualified person at each study site. To 
reduce operator dependence of results and ascertain uniform data collection, this person must 
have had sufficient training (took a course on hemophilia related MSKUS though [CONTACT_782800], 
through UCSD, or equivalent). Preferably, the MSKUS is performed by [CONTACT_782799]. Assessment at each time point should be of bilateral elbows, knees and ankles, if possible – at a minimum, MSKUS of an acute or historical target joint (elbow, knee or ankle) 
and the contralateral join has to be performed at baseline and at 3 years to be included in primary endpoint analysis.  
X-ray Assessment: The 1st [ADDRESS_1076502] x-rays of their target joint and 
contralateral joint using the following views: 
o Knee – radiographs: standard AP and lateral, but also include a merchant view (3 views 
total) 
o Elbow – radiographs: standard AP and lateral (2 views) 
o Ankle – radiographs: standard AP, lateral, and mortise (3 views) 
x-ray studies done within 6 months of study visit are permissible.  
MRI Assessment: The 1st [ADDRESS_1076503] MRI images of their target joint and 
contralateral joint using the following protocol: 
Joint Health Study - PI: [INVESTIGATOR_782783]-Jarres, MD/MPH 
 
 
Version 11-9-[ADDRESS_1076504] 
clinical MRI protocols using conventional 2D sequences in 3 imaging planes (typi[INVESTIGATOR_782789] [FSE]).  In addition, add a sagittal 2D gradient echo sequence (to better visualize hemosiderin deposits) and also a 3D sequence. The 3D sequences are depending on particular MRI vendor at the individual sites.  If available a 3D FSE should be performed (GE has CUBE, Siemens has SPACE, Philips has VISTA, Hita chi has isoFSE, and Toshiba has 3D MVOX).  
Acquisition for the 3D sequence should be in the sa gittal plane and voxel size should be close to 
isotropic.  The 3D sequence will be very useful for comparing specific planes with ultrasound (such as the femoral trochlea). The radiology cons ultant for this study will advise on sequencing 
at each individual site.  
MRI studies done within 6 months of study visit are permissible.
 
Biomarker Repository: During all visits, including acute pain and pain follow-up visits, the 
patient will be approaches to contribute blood samp les for the repository. Five citrated (blue top) 
tubes will be drawn, samples will be spun, aliquoted and frozen for potential later studies.  Cost to the patient: This study will cover the cost for the MSKUS performed, the x-ray and MRI 
validation exams for the first [ADDRESS_1076505] of the clotting factor and 
routine clinical laboratory. 
Patient compensation: The patient will be compen sated for his time for the baseline, year 1, year 
2, year 3, acute pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_782790]-up vi sit at $150.-/visit. Patients are allowed to get 
evaluation for more than 1 pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_782791], but there is no 
compensation for these additional visits. There will  also up to $50.-/visit in travel compensation 
for the baseline, year 1, year 2, year 3, and one  acute pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_782790]-up visit. 
 Statistical Plan 
For first 10 patients do MRI, compare Ultrasound to MRI and X-ray at baseline and 1 year; and 
compute sensitivity and specificity and evaluate the rate of false negatives by [CONTACT_2207], with 
MRI as gold standard. 
The primary outcome will be proportion of pati ents with improvement (compared to same or 
worse) between groups B and C, with analysis by [CONTACT_3493]’s Exact Test.  Given a feasible sample 
size of 20 patients per arm for groups B and C, we anticipate having 80% power to detect a 5-
fold increase in the proportion of patients classified as improved (e.g., from 10% to 50%).  
Proportions in each group classified as worse,  same, or improved will also be reported and 
compared by [CONTACT_3493]’s Exact Test.  
Sample Size 
- Arm A: 10 patients 
- Arm B: 20 patients 
- Arm C: 20 patients

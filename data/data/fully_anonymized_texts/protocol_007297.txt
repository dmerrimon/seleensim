Approximately [ADDRESS_1100644] 6 months before Screening.  
Randomized subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 
Before any study -specific procedures are performed, all subjects will read and sign the IRB -
approved informed consent form. 
Eligible subjects will complete 5 clinic visits as follows: 
 
•
 
Visit 1: Screening (Day -14 to -1) 
•
 
Visit 2: Period 1  
•
 
Visit 3: Period 2  
•
 
Visit 4: Period 3  
•
 
Visit 5: Period [ADDRESS_1100645] of three to four acceptable curves obtained at each 
time point. FVC and FEV 1/FVC ratio [(FEV 1/FVC) x 100] will also be recorded along with 
FEV 1 measurements at each visit.  
Screening  
Screening evaluations will be performed in accordance with the study calendar. Clinical 
assessments will include: vital sign measurement, height, weight, physical examination, urine 
pregnancy test ( for all women  of childbearing potential), 12 
-
lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and 
pulse oximetry (during methacholine bronchoprovocation challenges). Chest x -ray may be 
performed at discretion of the Investigator. Qualifying FEV [ADDRESS_1100646] be  ≥ 80% of 
predicted value. Once Qualifying FEV [ADDRESS_1100647] -saline FEV 1 should not drop more than 10% from pre -saline FEV 1 and 
should be ≥ 70% of predicted value . If the subject fails to meet any of  these requirements, the 
procedures must be stopped, rescue albuterol administered, and the visit should be rescheduled. 
All clinical assessments except height and weight will be performed at each rescheduled visit. 
Subjects who fail three consecutive visi ts will not be eligible to participate in the study. Subjects 
meeting post -saline FEV 1 criteria will undergo methacholine bronchoprovocation challenge with

concentratio n of inhaled methacholine required to reduce FEV 1 by 20% (PC 20) relative to the 
post- saline value. The maximum concentration of methacholine to be administered in this step 
will be 8 mg/mL. Subjects who do not respond to methacholine doses at or below 8  mg/mL will 
not be eligible for enrollment in the study.  
Once the methacholine challenge test is completed, rescue albuterol will be administered and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_460354] [ADDRESS_1100649]’s FEV 1 returns to 
within 90% of  the best post -saline FEV [ADDRESS_1100650] dosing visit will occur no earlier 
than 24 hours and no more than 14 days after Screening procedures and the interval (washout 
period) between dosing visits should be at least 48 hours. At each treatment visit, the following 
will be perfo rmed before dosing: 
• Vital sign measurement  
• 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as the discretion of the Investigator after the initial 
Screening visit  
• Pulse oximetry (during methacholine bronchoprovocation challenges) 
• Concomitant medication update (confirming washouts)  
• Adverse Events (AE) review  
• Urine pregnancy test for all women of childbearing potential 
A pre -treatment evaluation will be performed. This will confirm that pre -challenge FEV 1 is ≥ 
80% of predicted and within 88 and 112% of qualifying spi[INVESTIGATOR_798091]. 
After the first inhalation of saline control is administered, the FEV 1 should not drop more than 
10% compared to pre -challenge value and should be ≥ 70% of the predicted value. I f the subject 
fails to meet any of these requirement s, the procedures must be stopped, albuterol administered, 
and the visit should be rescheduled. Subjects who fail three consecutive visits should be dropped 
from the study. 
Subsequently, review of inhaler dosing technique, priming and preparation of inhalers will be 
performed. The subject will receive one of the four randomized study treatments. The time of 
last actuation will be recorded, as well as the adequacy of inhaler t echnique. Approximately 15

subjects that may discontinue from the study or have major protocol violations, and therefore not 
qualify for the PD population, up to 123 subjects will be randomized in the study.  
7. STUDY POPULATIONS  
Per-Protocol ( PP) Population 
The PP population will include all subjects  who: 
• Completed all four randomized treatment periods  with an evaluable PC 20FEV 1 in each 
period. 
• Were compliant with study treatment dosing procedures. 
• Did not use any restricted concomitant medications.  
• Did not have any other significant protocol deviations. 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) Population 
The PD population used in the dose- scale analyses will include subjects  who: 
• Completed at least one of the four randomized treatment periods  with an evaluable 
PC 20FEV 1.

Pharmacodynamic (PD) equivalence between Test and Reference will be based on the dose -scale 
method of analysis of the post -dose PC 20 (mg/mL) data using non -linear E max modeling, as 
outlined in the FDA Draft Guidance on Orlistat capsule (

PD data before fitting the Emax model is recommended for dose -scale analysis ” (
4
); however, 
this guidance does not specify  which log transformation should be used.  Therefore, the PC 20 
values will  be transformed  using the  reported  Log 2 method ( 5 , 6 ), prior to NONMEM® dataset 
construction. 
 
  
The datasets will include i ndividual albuterol dosing information  and PC20 data. The actual 
dosing amount per treatment  period will be used. Formulation will also be entered in the dataset. 
These will be entered as [ADDRESS_1100668]. The placebo dose 
will also be considered as the reference formulation. The dose amount for the placebo treatment 
will be set to 0. Data will be excluded from the analysis if insufficient or inaccurate  dosing 
information are recorded.  
8.2.5 Dose-Scale Approach  
To assess bioequivalence using PD endpoints, t he FDA albuterol- specific guidance  (
4
) 
recommends using the  dose- scale approach described  in FDA’s orlistat guidance (
3
). This 
approach involves fitting dose-response data using the following equation: 
Equation 1 
relrel
F Dose EDF Dose EE⋅ +⋅ ⋅+ =
500maxResponse  
In Equation 1, the response is the measured PC 20, E [ADDRESS_1100669] and reference 
products. 
The FDA  orlistat  guidance allows for the dose -scale Emax model to be fitted either to the mean 
or to the individual scores of dose response data. The analysis described in this plan will be

bioequivalence (BE) cro ssover trial.  
The PC 20 data w ill be  analyzed based on a two -step dose-s cale analysis to estimate F rel: 
• Firstly, a dose -response relationship w ill be  mathematically described by [CONTACT_798101]- response data , and an estimate for F rel will be  
obtained. 
• Secondly, a 90% confidence interval for F rel will be  estimated by [CONTACT_798102]'s ( 7 ) bias-
corrected and accelerated (BCa) method.  
8.2.6 Dose Response Emax Model 
The analysis will use the FDA recommended Emax model  using NONMEM®. The model will 
include the following: 
• Etas will be included on PD parameters E0, Emax and ED 50, coded as Theta(x)+Eta(x) 
for E 0 and Emax and as Theta(x)*exp(Eta(x)) for ED 50. 
• The possibility of adding an eta on the F rel parameter will be tested. . 
• A combination of proportional and additive residual error (Epsilons).  
Additionally, the model may be simplified by [CONTACT_798103] (Etas or Epsilons) if 
they are estimated  to be close to the boundary ( e.g., 0). 
Quality of fit and selection of an alternate model will be determined using the objec tive function. 
A lower objective function is preferred if a model has the same number of parameters. 
Otherwise, the model will be chosen according to  the difference in the MOF based on a Chi -
square distribution ( p < 0.01 will be considered significant) , taking the difference in the numbers 
of fitted parameters  into account . Throughout the modeling process, the first -order conditional 
estimate (FOCE) option in NONMEM will be used.  
8.2.7 Alternative Approach  to the Dose Response Emax Model  
The Emax  model (as described in Sections 8.2.5 and 8.2.6) is the model described by [CONTACT_798104] (
3
) and is the preferred one.  However , based on the results of this Emax 
model, further analysis may be required. More specifically, an alternate approach will be used to 
re-analyze the data if the following 2 criteria are met:  
• If the predicted response of the low-dose and high-dose of albute rol fall within 20 -80% of 
the maximum response. 
• If the predicted response for the low -dose of albuterol is ≥ 75% of the predicted response 
for the high- dose albuterol.

12/21/2018                  Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited               Page 20 of 64 Therefore, if the Emax  model previously described in this section is appropriate at describing the 
PC 20 data, it will be used and will be considered final. However, if this Emax model is 
considered inappropriate (based on criteria listed above), the alternative modeling approac h will 
be used as described below.  
The relationship between dose and response can often be described by a hyperbolic curve that is 
defined by [CONTACT_12801], often called the “Emax model”:  
Equation 2 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒 =𝐸𝑚𝑎𝑥∙𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒
𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒+𝐷50 
 
This relationship is depi[INVESTIGATOR_48393], in Figure 1.  
Figure 1. Example of Emax Dose- Response Relationship  
 
In theory, a minimum of two observations are required to estimat e the two model parameters 
(Emax and D 50). Ideally, these two data points should be as far apart as possible, and lie close to 
the inflection points on the curve , to properly characterize Emax and D 50. This ideal scenario is 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 2 ; with the predicted Emax curve in black, observed data represented by [CONTACT_798105] , and their associated error shown by [CONTACT_798106]’s  cente r.

far apart.  If these two data points are too close to one and other,  Emax and ED 50 estimations can 
be more difficult and less certain.  
In other words, different Emax relationships, or combinations of parameter estimates (Emax and 
ED 50), could explain the same data points ; therefore , it becomes more difficult to know with 
certainty which relationship reflects reality.  This problem is illustrated in Figure 3, where very 
different Emax  curves (denoted by [CONTACT_798107], blue and yellow lines) all pass through the same 
two observed data points (red points with vertical error bars).

If the response data associated with the two doses (90 mg and 180 mg) are close to one an d 
other, which is analogous to the scenario depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 3, this proximity of the data will 
make it difficult to properly estimate the parameters Emax and ED 50. 
In such cases, log -transformation of the independent variable (dose) can be beneficial.  The log 10 
transformation of dose is used in such analys es. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_798094], 
it is recognized that when the data on the X -axis are log -transformed, the relationship becomes 
more  linear, especially between doses that are associated with 20% and 80% of Emax.  (
8
); this is 
illustrated in Figure 4.

When using a log -linear model, the relationship between log(dose) and response can be 
described by a straight -line between 20% and 80% of the maximum effect. Consequently , it is  no 
longer necessary to estimate Emax and ED 50 parameters, thereby [CONTACT_798108].  Instead, the relationship between log(dose) and 
response can be described by a simple slope and intercept. 
It can also be appreciated from Figure  4 that when using the log -linear model, the intercept (the 
hypothetical response at dose zero based on a linear relationship) is not equivalent to  the E 0 that 
is associated with the Emax model.  Therefore, response data associated with the placebo should 
not be fitted by [CONTACT_63450] -linear model for two reasons: 
1) Linearity only applies to doses that are associated with responses that are between 20% 
and 80% of the maximal response.  By [CONTACT_108], this excludes a dose of zero that is not 
associated with a respo nse.  
2) Inclusion of placebo data would falsely bias the estimation of the intercept parameter, and 
the slope that would be fitted by [CONTACT_798109].  Other 
parameter estimates (such as F rel) will also be unreliable.   
For the rea sons above, the placebo data should not be fitted in the log -linear model.  In such an 
analysis, only response data associated with the [ADDRESS_1100672].

Equation 3  𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒 =𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑝𝑡 +𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒∗𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒∗𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑙 
In this relationship, both response and dose are log- transformed.  
The analysis using the Emax  model detailed in the previous section will be presented for 
information purposes only even if this alternative approach is used. 
8.2.8 Bootstrap 
In the FDA orlistat guidance  (
3
), 90%  CI are constructed using a nonparametric bootstrap 
technique. Essentially, subjects are repeatedly sampled at random with replacement, creating 
new datasets of the same size as the original dataset  and new PD parameters are estimated using 
the same final model .  Ten thousand ( 10 000) of these bootstrap samples will be  constructed and 
NONMEM® analyses will be  performed on al l.  A matrix of bootstrap mean population estimates 
(Frel) will thus be obtained  ( 9 ). Only the bootstrap for successful NONMEM® analyses will be 
used to build the 90% CI.

8.2.9 Calculation of Confidence Intervals for Frel  
The bias -corrected and accelerated (BCa) method for constructing the 90% CI for F rel will be

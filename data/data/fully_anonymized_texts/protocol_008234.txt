 Study Title:  Minocycline for Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Veterans  
Principal  Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_158260], MD  
Background:  
 
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder characterized by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-
experiencing aspects of the original trauma, avoidance and numbing of trauma 
reminders, and general hyperarousal. Lifetime prevalence of PTSD in community 
samples is around 6.8%, Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/Operation Iraqi Freedom 
(OIF) veterans ar ound 12.5%, and as high as 30% among Vietnam veterans.1,2 
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition 
(DSM -IV), one must experience a specific set of symptoms for at least one month 
following exposure to a traumatic event in order to meet criteria for PTSD.  
 
It has been proposed that cumulative stress may play a significant role in the 
development of PTSD .3 There is also evidence that impairments in higher -order 
cognitive abilities (i.e., executive functions) may contribute to symptoms of PTSD .4,[ADDRESS_183943] reported elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines  such as C -reactive 
protein (CRP) , interleukin 6 (IL -6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)  in patients 
with PTSD. Groer et al. studied levels of inflammation in active duty mili tary personnel 
and found that elevated CRP was associated with depression and PTSD symptoms.[ADDRESS_183944] investigated  the efficacy of minocycline treatment in veterans with  PTSD.  
 
Significance:   
The Veterans Health Administration has a growing population of veterans exposed to 
combat during their military service , and there is a clear need to identify more effective 
forms of treatment for PTSD. Understanding the clinical phenomenology, risk factors 
and potential biomarkers of this condition could pave the way for better screening 
methods and treatment interventions for clinicians.  
 
Study Aim:  
The specific aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_158261] . 
 
Hypothesis:  
We hypothesize that treatment with adjunctive minocycline will be associated with  
reduced  inflammation (as indexed by  [CONTACT_158268] ) and reduced 
severity of PTSD and mood symptoms.  
 
Study Design:  
A 12-week, open -label pi[INVESTIGATOR_158262] 15 subjects diagnosed with PTSD.  
 
Participants:  
Recruitment:  Participants will be recruited from the pool of patients presenting to the 
Omaha VA Medical Center.

 Study Procedures:  
 
The schedule of all study visits and procedures is summarized below and in Table 1 . 
 
Screening Visit (Visit 1):  
After providing informed consent, patients will be screened for participation in the study. 
The Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M INI) will be used to screen for 
comorbid  psychiatric disorders. The PTSD Checklist for DSM -5 (PCL -5) will be used to 
confirm diagnosis of PTSD.  Depression symptoms will be assessed using the Beck 
Depression Inventory -II (BDI -II). Medical history, physical exam, vital signs , and review 
of concomitant medications  will also be completed.  
 
Blood and urine samples will be obtained and tested by [CONTACT_158271] . 
Laboratory tests will include  complete blood count ( CBC ), comprehensive metabolic 
panel ( CMP ), routine urinalysis, urine pregnancy test (if applicable) , C-reactive protein 
(CRP),  interleukin 6 (IL -6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) . Based on previous 
research, we anticipate that levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines (CRP, IL -6, and TNFα ) 
may be elevated. However, as patients with non -elevated cytokine levels at screening 
may still exhibit significant change over the course of the study  and provide useful data , 
no minimum cutoff level for cytokin es will be used in this study.  
 
Baseline Visit (Visit 2):  
PTSD symptoms will be assessed using the Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale for 
DSM -5 (CAPS -5). The CAPS is a [ADDRESS_183950] month (current)  PTSD.  
The Clinical Global Impression s (CGI) Scale will be administered to assess overall  
severity of symptoms , and vital signs will also be obtained . As previous research 
indicates that executive dysfunction may contribute to PTSD symptoms ,4,5 we will 
assess executive functioning using two measures: t he Trail Making Test (TMT) and 
Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) Test . The TMT is a measure of visual 
attention and task switching, while the COWA is a measure of verbal fluency. 
Concomitant medications will be reviewed and drug dispensing will occur at this visit.  
 
Follow -up Visits (Visits 3-6):  
Visit [ADDRESS_183951] to monitor dose increase from 100mg/day to 
200mg/day. Visits 4 -6 will be clinic visits to include the following procedures: vital signs, 
adverse event evaluation, drug dispensing/accountability/adjustment, and review of 
6 
 concomitant medications.  The CGI will be administered to assess overall  severity and 
improvement in symptoms.  
 
End of Study  (Visit 7): 
The end of study visit will include administration of the CAPS, BDI -II, CGI , TMT, and 
COWA scales, as well as physical exam, vital signs, and laboratory evaluation 
(including measurement of CRP , IL-6, and TNFα ). Adverse event evaluation, drug 
accountability, and review of concomitant medications will also be completed at this 
visit. 
 
Safety Follow -up (Visit 8): 
This visit will be conducted only for  patients who have ongoing adverse event(s). The 
following procedures will be completed at this visit:  CGI, vital signs , adverse event 
evaluation, and review of concomitant medications.  
 
Study Medication and Dosing Regimen:  
This is a 12 -week, open -label study in which minocycline will be administered to  
veterans with PTSD. Dosing will be titrated to reduce potential side effects that may be 
experienced when starting minocycline. The titration schedule is as follows: 1 00 mg/ day 
1 to 7 , 200 mg/day 8 to end of week 12. 
 
During the course of the study patients will be supplied with 100 mg minocycline  
capsules . Study medication will be administered as a single daily dose (100 mg  
total/day 1 to 7 ) or twice daily dose (200 mg  total/day 8 to end of week 12 ). Subjects will 
be instructed to take study mediation with a full glass of water and to not lie down for at 
least [ADDRESS_183952] the dosing regimen during the course of the study based on 
tolerance to the stu dy medication. The maximum dose permitted for minocycline will be 
200 mg per day . Upon the Investigator’s determination of the dosage regimen for each 
subject, the study medication will be dispensed in an amount sufficient to cover the 
window between the study visits plus at least [ADDRESS_183953] months.   
 
Treatment compliance will be monitored by  [CONTACT_158272].  Records of 
concomitant medications will be taken at each study visit as well as reports of adverse 
events.  
7 
 Efficacy Evaluation:  
The primary ef ficacy measures will be (1) change in CAPS total scores from baseline to 
end of study, and (2) change in level s of the inflammatory cytokines CRP, IL -6, and 
TNF-α from screening to end of study. Secondary measures of efficacy will include  
change in BDI -II, CGI, TMT, and COWA scores from baseline to end of study.  
 
Statistical Analysis:  
Statistical analyses will include t -tests (or a nonparametric equivalent) for com parison of 
scores  on CAPS, BDI -II, CGI , TMT , and COWA  from baseline to end of study  and 
change in inflammatory cytokine levels from screening to  end of study.  Correlational 
analyses will be used when appropriate to determine the degree of association among 
variables. Further analyses will be conducted to examine the effects of other factors on 
the primary measures (e.g., medical and psychiatric history, concurre nt psychiatric 
treatment). SPSS software will be used for statistical analyses.  
 
Safety Evaluation and Monitoring:  
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_158273] . This may include any clinically significant changes in vital signs 
(blood pressure , pulse , and weight), physical examinations, laboratory evaluations 
(blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) and recording of concomitant treatment.  
In cases of adverse effects of minocycline treatment, trial medication will be stopped for 
five days and then recommenced. Participants will be con tacted following  
recommencement to determine if adverse effects have returned.  
 
Treatment compliance will be monitored by [CONTACT_158272], and patients 
will be counseled if they do not adhere, or if they are thought to be at risk for not  
adhe ring to the medication regimen.  
 
A Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be utilized to ensure patient safety 
and will consist of expert clinicians in the disease area. Drs. Robert Langenfeld  and 
Angelo Zieno , Staff Psychiatrists will review safety data. The DSMC will have access to 
any and all data to assess the safety of the subjects. Adverse event data will be tallied 
and maintained for the DSMC to review. Following each data review, the DSMC will 
make recommendations regarding the conduct of the study, including continuing the 
study without modifications, to terminate or to modify the study design for safety 
reasons.  
The following will be considered as decision rules to discontinue the subject’s 
participation in the study: If the subject develops  symptoms requiring treatment with 
8 
 antibiotics or other forms of treatment not permitted during the course of the study  (see 
Exclusion Criteria) . If the subject experi ences a serious adverse event. If the subject 
develops suicidal or homicidal thoughts. If the subject misses two or more cons ecutive 
study visits in a row. If the subject takes less than 80% of the s tudy medication as 
prescribed.  
 
Human Subject Protection and Confidentiality:  
During screening , we anticipate some subjects to endorse  suicidal thoughts either 
current or past. We propose to manage suicide risk by a systematic and careful 
assessment of suicidality. Subjects will be assessed at screening using the MINI 
Suicidality Module. This instrument provides information regarding past history of 
suicidal ideation and attempts as well as information about recent and current suicidal 
thinking, plans and attempts. Participants with a past history of attempt(s) and/or current 
serious ideation will trigger a more detailed revi ew of their risk by [CONTACT_978]. The disposition 
of subjects with serious symptoms will follow standard clinical care protocol. Such 
subjects will not proceed in the study.  
 
Patients with diagnosis of major mental disorders ( e.g., bipolar disorder, psychotic 
disorders) that were previously undiagnosed will be referred to the PCP for further 
management and will be offered a same day walk -in appointment in the Mental Health 
Clinic . 
 
Utmost care will be taken to ensure subjects’ psychological well-being  and minimiz e 
discomfort during administration of protocol assessments. Psychological instruments 
will be administered by [CONTACT_158274] d in dealing with PTSD. 
In the event a subject experiences worsening mood, anxiety or sleep problems following 
the visits , they will be provided an opportunity for debriefing  and may exit the study if 
they require treatment s not permitted during  the study . 
 
To protect privacy and confidentiality, we used only coded data without patient names 
or identifiers.  All working papers will be stored in a secure area and will be shredded 
when they are no longer useful. An electronic database will be created for storage of the 
data. Data from all sources will be entered into an Excel spreadsheet maintained in a 
secure, limited access folder on the secure VA NWI server via secure VA computers 
directly on site. De -identified data in the Excel spreadsheet eventually would be 
converted into a SPSS database for statistical analysis. No PHI or other identifiable d ata 
will leave the VA secure environments, physical or electronic. Access to the records will 
be limited to the study team . 
 
9 
 All participants will be asked to sign a HIPAA authorization to allow for access and use 
of protected health information (PHI). Thi s authorization will expi[INVESTIGATOR_158267]. Protected health information (PHI) to be used or collected will include information 
from patients' VA Health Records (e.g., diagnoses, medications) and specific 
information concerning alcohol and drug ab use, HIV, demographics, and 
questionnaires. This information may be disclosed to entities outside the VA, including 
other federal agencies required to monitor or oversee research (e.g., the Food and Drug  
Administration (FDA), Government Accounting Office (GAO), Office of Human Research 
Protection (OHRP)), Nebraska Educational Biomedical Research Association (NEBRA), 
and a VA contractor for purposes of accreditation.  
 
Resources:  
No resources beyond what is already available in terms of staff and equipment will be 
necessary to conduct this project.

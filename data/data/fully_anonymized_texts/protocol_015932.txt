Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  6 Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, multicenter study 
designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ALN -AGT01, 
administered subcutaneously (SC), in patients with mild- to-moderate hypertension. A schematic 
of the study design is provided in Figure 1. Before randomization, patients will discontinue prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) for a Washout period of at least 2 weeks (4 weeks of washout is required for long-acting antihypertensive medications, such as long-acting diuretics or 
calcium  channel blockers). Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for enrollment will receive ALN -AGT01 or placebo for the first 
6 months of the 12-month Double-blind (DB) treatment period.  
Starting at Month 3, conventional oral antihypertensives may be added per Investigator 
judgement for elevated blood pressure. Oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be temporarily held from Month [ADDRESS_164598]-AGT01 alone (vs placebo) at Month 6 
by [CONTACT_46674] (ABPM). During this 4-week period, blood pressure 
will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144680]. Patients may resume conventional oral antihypertensives at Month [ADDRESS_164599]-AGT01 open-label extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reached Month [ADDRESS_164600] continued their current blinded dosing in the DB 
Extension period for up to 24 additional months until the OLE study wa s open and then 
transition.  Upon implementation of Amendment 6, the DB Extension period will be closed 
because a separate OLE study will not be conducted. Patients in the 12-month DB period will continue their planned dosing and assessments through the end of the 12-month DB period and then enter the Safety Follow-up period. Patients will not receive a dose of study drug at Month 
12. Patients in the DB Extension period will complete end of treatment ( EOT) assessments at 
Month 18, 24, 30, or 36 (whichever visit comes first) and enter the Safety Follow-up period. 
Number of Planned Patients  
Approximately 375 patients will be enrolled in this study. 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
This study will include adults (18 to 75 years, inclusive, at time of initial informed consent) with 
untreated hypertension or on stable therapy with up to [ADDRESS_164601] a daytime mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥135 mmHg and ≤[ADDRESS_164602]-AGT01 is an SC administered N -acetylgalactosamine -conjugated small interfering RNA 
targeting liver -expressed messenger RNA for angiotensinogen (AGT).

Amendment 6, [ADDRESS_164604] dose of study drug if their next visit is at Month 15, 21, 27, or 33 (whichever 
comes first) . Patients will not receive study drug at other visits in the DB Extension period. 
Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Placebo (sodium chloride 0.9% w/v for SC administration) will be administered once every [ADDRESS_164605] -AGT01 is up to 36 months. The estimated total time on 
study for each patient is up to 47 months, including up to 2 months of screening, followed by [CONTACT_25765] 36 months of treatment, and up to 12 months in the Follow-up period. 
Statistical  Methods  
The planned enrollment for this study is 375 patients. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] 
(black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] (mean 24- hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg). 
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_164606]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg, and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sam ple size of 
375 patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response signal in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_164607] -AGT01 dose versus placebo with a 2-sided significance 
level of 0.05.  
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows:  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by- treatment analyses based on the FAS will be according to the 
randomized treatment arm.  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug, grouped 
according to the treatment actually received.  
• Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Set : All patients who received at least [ADDRESS_164608] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  8 • PD Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of study drug. All by-
treatment analyses based on the PD Analysis Set will be grouped according to the 
treatment actually received.  
• All ALN- AGT01 Treated Set:  All patients who received any amount of [ADDRESS_164609]-AGT01 throughout the entire DB period (including DB Extension period). 
To control the overall type I error, the primary and key secondary endpoints will be tested in 
hierarchical order.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Sponsor) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_144647]-AGT01 (zilebesiran), a 
subcutaneously (SC) administered investigational agent comprised of a synthetic small 
interfering (siRNA) covalently linked to a triantennary N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand, 
which is designed to suppress liver production of angiotensinogen (AGT) and thereby [CONTACT_144682].  
1.1. Study Rationale  
Study ALN- AGT01 -002 (KARDIA -1) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-
ranging, multicenter Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ALN-AGT01, administered SC, in patients with mild -to-moderate 
hypertension. Patients will be randomized to [ADDRESS_164628] 6 months of the 12-month Double-blind (DB) period. After the first [ADDRESS_164629] -AGT01 
open-label extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reached Month [ADDRESS_164630] continued their current blinded dosing in the DB Extension 
period for up to 24 additional months until the OLE study was open and then transition. Upon 
implementation of Amendment 6, the DB Extension period will be closed because a separate 
OLE study will not be conducted. Patients in the 12-month DB period will continue their planned dosing and assessments through the end of the 12-month DB period and then enter the Safety 
Follow-up period. Patients in the DB Extension period will complete end of treatment ( EOT ) 
assessments at Month 18, 24, 30, or 36 (whichever visit comes first) and enter the Safety Follow -
up period. 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of ALN- AGT01 for the treatment 
of hypertension by [CONTACT_144683] (SBP) from baseline to 
Month 3, as assessed by [CONTACT_46674] (ABPM). Se condary and 
exploratory objectives of the study include evaluating the efficacy of ALN-AGT01 on other measures of blood pressure response and evaluating the PD effect of ALN-AGT01, including reduction in circulating AGT concentration. 
The full rationale for the study and design is presented in Section 3.2. 
1.2. Background  
Hypertension affects 30% to 45% of adults and is the strongest modifiable risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction.[ Olsen 2016; Williams 2018 ] 
The worldwide disease burden is profound, with a global prevalence of over 1 billion,[ Kearney 
2005; NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017] and approximately 9 million deaths attributed to hypertension annually.[ Angell 2015] 
Currently available pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144648] a minority of patients, due in large part to physician inertia and patient nonadherence to daily oral medication. [Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Low adherence to oral antihypertensives is 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164631] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  24 associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes and is prevalent at all stages of disease. [Corrao 
2011; Peacock 2017; Schulz 2016; van der Laan 2017] Thus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_144649], current rates of control are low, and the global burden of death and disability-adjusted life -years attributed to elevated blood pressure remains high.[ Forouzanfar 2017; 
Muntner 2020] Development of new approaches to treat hypertension and to overcome the limitations of current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217] a key unmet need. [Dzau 2019; McClellan 2019 ; Services 2020] 
The Sponsor is developi[INVESTIGATOR_144647]-AGT01, a novel synthetic RNA interference (RNAi) 
therapeutic, for SC administration for the treatment of hypertension. RNAi is a naturally 
occurring cellular mechanism for regulation of gene expression, mediated through the binding of siRNA to its complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, leading to mRNA cleavage 
and subsequent suppression of the synthesis and levels of the target protein. ALN- AGT01 
contains an siRNA targeting AGT  mRNA, conjugated to a GalNAc-containing liga nd to facilitate 
delivery to the liver. Based on the mechanism of RNAi, ALN-AGT01 is specifically designed to reduce the hepatic synthesis of AGT protein, the first substrate in the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sole precursor of vasoactive angiotensin peptides.[ Khanna 
2017; Romero 2015] Because hepatocytes are the predominant source of circulating AGT, 
ALN-AGT01 has been developed to reduce blood pressure by [CONTACT_144684] (AngII). 
Preliminary data from Part A of the ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_164632]- AGT01 -001 (hereafter referred 
to as Study 001) in patients with hypertension have shown that single SC doses of ALN- AGT01 
lead to dose-dependent and durable reductions in circulating AGT, accompanied by [CONTACT_144685] (DBP). Reductions in AGT for up to [ADDRESS_164633] adverse events (AEs) have been mild or moderate in severity, and there have been no 
severe or serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study drug. There have been no clinically 
significant elevations in serum creatinine or serum potassium, and no patient has required 
intervention for low blood pressure. No clinically significant alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations have been observed in Part A patients who received ALN-AGT01 doses as high as 
800 mg. Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported in a minority of patients and were all mild 
and transient events that resolved without intervention. 
This Phase [ADDRESS_164634]-AGT01 across a 
range of doses (150 to 600 mg) and dose intervals (once every 3 months and once every 6 
months) to identify optimal treatment. The consistent and prolonged PD effec t of ALN -AGT01 
is expected to achieve the unique benefit of continuous 24-hour blood pressure lowering with infrequent SC dosing.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ALN-AGT01 is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
Clinical data available from Study [ADDRESS_164635] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  28 monitoring [HBPM] SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP <135 mmHg by 
[CONTACT_44117]). [Williams 2018 ] Oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be temporarily held from Month 
5 to Month 6 in appropriate patients (Month 5 office SBP <155 mmHg if taking 1 oral 
antihypertensive agent or office SBP <150 mmHg if taking 2 agents) to assess the effect of 
ALN- AGT01  alone (vs placebo) at Month 6 by [CONTACT_44117]. During this 4-week period, blood 
pressure will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144686] >170 mmHg (or if confirmed office SBP >160 mmHg accompanied by [CONTACT_23805]). 
Patients may have be en eligible to participate in a separate ALN-AGT01 OLE study upon 
completion of the Month [ADDRESS_164636] continued their current blinded dosing in 
the DB Extension period for up to 24 additional months until the OLE study wa s open and then 
transition.  
In the DB Extension period, blood pressure will be closely monitored and individual 
modification of antihypertensive therapy will be allowed to maintain blood pressure in target range.  
Upon implementation of Amendment 6, the DB Extension period will be closed because a 
separate OLE study will not be conducted. Patients in the  12-month DB period will continue 
dosing and assessments as scheduled through Month 12. Upon completion of predose 
assessments at the Month 12 visit, patients will enter the Safety Follow -up period. Patients will 
not receive a dose of study drug at the Month 12 visit. For patients in the DB Extension period: 
• If the next visit upon implementation of Amendment 6 is Month 15, 21, 27, or 33, the 
patient should complete the scheduled assessments and receive the planned dose of study drug. Patients should return for their next scheduled visit (Month 18, 24, 30, or 
36) to complete EOT assessments and enter the Safety Follow -up period. Patients will 
not receive a dose of study drug at the Month 18, 24, 30, or 36 visit. 
• If the next visit upon implementation of Amendment 6 is Month 18, 24, 30, or 36, the 
patient should complete EOT assessments and enter the Safety Follow-up period. Patients will not receive a dose of study drug at the Month 18, 24, 30, or 36 visit. 
Patients will be considered as completing study drug if they received all planned doses during the 12-month DB period (Day 1 and Months 3, 6, and 9) and completed the Month [ADDRESS_164637] 
dose of study drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline level 
(if known) or until [ADDRESS_164638] dose of study drug, whichever comes earlier. During 
the Safety Follow-up period, patients should return to their pre- study medical care (usual care).  
Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will be asked to complete the 
remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration) 
through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, EOT/early termination (ET) assessments should be performed. 
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 375 patients (75 patients per group). 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164639] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, [ADDRESS_164640]-AGT01 across a range of doses and 
dose intervals to identify optimal treatment regimens for study in Phase 3. 
Patients will discontinue prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) for 2 to 4 weeks prior to 
study drug administration. During the study, blood pressure will be monitored with both outpatient 24-hour ABPM and automated office blood pressure measurements 
(EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in 
the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016). The primary endpoint will be assessed by [CONTACT_144687]. In addition, 24-hour ABPM can 
assess short -term blood pressure variability and circadian patterns (including potential restoration 
of the normal nocturnal blood pressure dippi[INVESTIGATOR_144650] 21% to 35% of hypertensive 
patients). [de la Sierra 2009 ; White 1998] More frequent measurements will be collected through 
a third method, oscillometric HBPM, to assess long-term blood pressure variability and provide close safety monitoring for potential hypotension (or hypertension) while not in the clinic. 
As recommended by [CONTACT_144688] (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH] Principles for Clinical Evaluation of 
New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000 and EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016), the first [ADDRESS_164641] ethical standards for the treatment of pati ents with hypertension, individual 
modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator judgement to maintain blood 
pressure within target is permitted starting at Month 3 and will continue throughout the study 
(except between Month 5 and Month 6 as described in Section 3.1). Separate from these treat -to-
target modifications, any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg or 
DBP ≥120 mmHg) will be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug 
administration.  
If a patient requires treatment with a conventional oral antihypertensive before Month 6, a CCB 
and/or thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic may be added because there is extensive experience 
combining these classes with antihypertensive drugs that impact the RAAS. Additionally, their 
blood pressure effects are expected to washout within [ADDRESS_164642]-AGT01 at Month 6 (trough for the 
once every 6 month regimens) relative to placebo is critical to evaluate the feasibility of once every 6 month dosing regimens for future study in Phase 3. Accordingly, oral antihypertensives 
(if taking) will be temporarily held from Month [ADDRESS_164643] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  30 patient, this limited interruption in oral antihypertensives will be contingent upon the patient’s 
Month 5 office SBP being adequately controlled (see Table 4 ) and the Investigator’s assessment 
that interruption can be safely performed and carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144689]. Of 
note, a withdrawal period is a standard element in studies of oral antihypertensives that is often 
used to establish assay sensitivity, to demonstrate maintenance of efficacy, and to assess possible 
withdrawal effects (ICH E12A; Principles for Clinical Evaluation of New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000). Outside of research studies, antihypertensives are temporarily discontinued in 
clinical practice for diagnostic purposes, and interruptions up to [ADDRESS_164644] been shown to be 
safe.[Beeftink 2017] In this study, the period of interruption is limited to [ADDRESS_164645] -AGT01. If a clinically 
significant blood pressure elevation (confirmed SBP >170 mmHg; or SBP >160 mmHg accom panied by [CONTACT_23805]) occurs after the interruption of oral antihypertensives, Investigators 
will instruct the patient to promptly resume dosing with their existing supply of oral medication.  
After Month 6, other oral antihypertensives may be used at the discretion of the Investigator, 
following current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Because ALN -AGT01 acts on 
the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin II-receptor blocker [ARB], 
angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue agents for 
high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study. Blood pressure and pharmacokinetic (PK)/PD assessments will be collected through Month [ADDRESS_164646] -AGT01 for the liver is hypothesized to improve tolerability 
relative to current oral antihypertensives, [Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] the protocol’s monitoring 
plan is designed to meet the standards set by [CONTACT_144690],[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] with improvements to include the use of the newer 
oral potassium binder patiromer (or with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate [ZS-9]), if available, for 
treatment of potential hyperkalemia. [Georgianos 2018; Weir 2015] The risk of renal safety 
events is further mitigated in this study by [CONTACT_144691], which exclude patients who are at highest risk to have events (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 mL/min/1.73m

baseline serum potassium >5 mEq/L, poorly controlled diabetes, or severely increased 
albuminuria) and those who may have decreased tolerance for renal safety events (patients with 
clinically significant heart failure, valvular heart disease, or recent hi story of cardiovascular 
event).  
3.3. Justification for Dose  
The doses of ALN-AGT01 in this study were selected on the basis of data from the Phase [ADDRESS_164647] an acceptable safety profile, and clinically significant placebo- corrected reductions in mea n SBP >10 mmHg 
by 24-hour ABPM were observed after doses as low as 100 mg. Dose selection was guided by [CONTACT_144692] a range of PD effects (ie, lowering of serum AGT) and antihypertensive responses. This is expected to enable 
development of population average dose-response relationships for PD and efficacy to guide 
identification of optimal treatment regimens (dose and dose frequency) for Phase 3.  
Preliminary PK/PD modeling based on serum AGT data from Study [ADDRESS_164648] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  31 close to 6 months after dosing. Modeling of the relationship between serum AGT lowering and 
blood pressure suggests a log- linear relationship, with ≥92% reduction in serum AGT predicted 
to achieve median SBP reduction of ≥10 mmHg.  
Based on these, the once every 6 month doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg were selected to result in 
median serum AGT reductions of 81.9%, 89.4%, and 94.9%, respectively, at trough (Month 6), 
translating to median SBP reductions of 6.67 mmHg, 8.74 mmHg, and 11.6 mmHg, respectively. Thus, the selected doses will enable characterization of the dose-response relationships for serum AGT and blood pressure with the once every 6 month regimen. 
The selected doses also enable characterization of the dose-response relationships for serum 
AGT and blood pressure with once every 3 month regimens based on analysis of data from all 
arms at Month  3. This will provide support for development of a once every 3 month regimen, if 
desired. To this end, 300 mg once every 3 months will be evaluated to identify any cumulative 
effects. The 300 mg once every 3 months dose is predicted to result in median serum AGT reductions of >95% at trough (Month 3), translating to median SBP reductions of >[ADDRESS_164649] -AGT01 as an antihypertensive therapeutic that results in reduction of blood pressure by 
≥10 mmHg throughout the dosing interval with infrequent administration. 
3.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
Using the Interactive Response Technology (IRT), patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_164650] 6 months of the 12-month DB period: 
• Placebo SC once every 3 months 
• [ADDRESS_164651]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_164652]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_164653]-AGT01 SC once every 3 months 
• [ADDRESS_164654]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
Patients initially randomized to placebo will be re -randomized 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_164655] -AGT01 regimens. 
Before Amendment 6, patients who enter ed the DB Extension period continued their current 
blinded dosing regimen from the DB period. Upon implementation of Amendment 6, patients in the 12-month DB period will continue their planned dosing and assessments through the end of 
the 12-month DB period but will not be eligible to enter the DB Extension period and receive a 
dose of study drug at Month 12. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] 
(mean 24 -hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg). 
Each patient will be uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and patient identification number. Upon signing the informed consent form (ICF), the patient will be 
assigned a patient identification number by [CONTACT_82550]. The Investigator or his/her designee 
will randomize the patient in IRT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164656] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  32 and none of the exclusion criteria. The Investigator or his/her designee will re-randomize the 
patient in IRT at Month [ADDRESS_164657]-AGT01 dose 
groups. 
3.5. Blinding  
The Sponsor, all site personnel (except for the site pharmacist or delegate), and patients will be 
blinded to study drug treatment through Month [ADDRESS_164658] patient’s Month 6 visit, a limited amount (ie, one -third) of SBP data will be made 
available to this small, independent pharmacometrics team for preliminary PK/PD modeling. 
After the database lock to support the analysis of Month 6 data is complete, all other Sponsor 
personnel will be unblinded to treatment assignment, but the site personnel (except for the site pharmacist) and patients will remain blinded to treatment assignment until after final database 
lock. The Sponsor and all site personnel will be blinded to serum AGT results until their 
respective unblinding. Serum AGT results will not be reported to site personnel until after  the 
last patient completes the assessments at the Month 12 visit.  
Blinded doses of study drug will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator (see 
Section  5.2.2). All patients will receive the same volume and number of injections regardless of 
treatment assignment (patients receiving once every [ADDRESS_164659]-AGT01 to maintain the blind). Because ALN -AGT01 may be slightly visually distinguishable from placebo, all blinded study 
drug doses will be prepared and the syringe(s) will be masked by a site pharmacist or delegate 
prior to administration by a blinded healthcare professiona l. See the Pharmacy Manual for 
additional details.  
3.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
If the treating physician determines that the clinical management of the patient requires knowledge of the study drug assignment, the Investigator may break the blind, as necessary, in 
IRT. If time permits, clinical study center personnel should contact [CONTACT_3433] e Medical Monitor before 
unblinding to discuss the need to unblind the patient but must do so within [ADDRESS_164660] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, [ADDRESS_164661] reached the end of the study if the patient has completed the Safety Follow-up visits as described in  Section  3.1.

4.3. Removal from Study Drug or Assessment  
Patients are free to discontinue study drug and/or stop protocol procedural assessments, or 
participation in the study as a whole at any time and for any reason, without penalty to their 
continuing medical care. The Investigator or the Sponsor may discontinue study drug or stop a patient’s participation in the study at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best 
interest. Any discontinuation of treatment or the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144652]’s participation in the 
study must be fully documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and should be followed up by [CONTACT_737]. 
Discontinuation of study drug or declining procedural assessments is described in Section 4.3.1,

• Significant protocol deviation; which includes required treatment with prohibited medication (as defined in Section  5.5.2) per Investigator discretion 
• AE 
• Non-adherence to treatment regimen  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Other reason (non- AE) 
• Or, study is terminated by [CONTACT_144694] -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164672] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  37 If possible, the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor or Medical Monitor before 
discontinuing dosing in the patient. Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study 
drug dosing immediately (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for reporting and follow-up of pregnancy). A positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug. 
Patients who discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments should not be 
automatically removed from study. In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for 
any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments and 
study visits so that their experience is captured in the final analyses.  
If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1), including different options for follow-up and collection 
of data (eg, in person, by [CONTACT_648], by [CONTACT_2319], through family or friends, or from options not 
involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians or from review 
of medical records), including endpoints and AEs, and must document this decision in the patient’s medical records.  
If a patient discontinues dosing due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason 
must be recorded in the eCRF. Patients who discontinue study drug and remain on study may 
receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator 
judge ment, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue from study drug before Month 6 will be encouraged to remain on the 
study and complete assessments (except study drug administration) through Month 6. They will 
also be asked to complete Safety Follow-up visits once every [ADDRESS_164673] dose of 
study drug per the safety follow- up schedule (see Table 1) until PD recovery or [ADDRESS_164674] dose of study drug (whichever is earlier); see Section 3.1. 
Patients who discontinue study drug after the Month 6 visit will be asked to return for their next 
scheduled visit to complete EOT/ET assessments and complete Safety Follow -up visits once 
every [ADDRESS_164675] dose of study drug per the safety follow-up schedule (see Table 1 ) 
until PD recovery or [ADDRESS_164676] dose of study drug (whichever is earlier); see Section  3.1.

Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  38 A patient considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144654] 6 visit should be 
informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and 
remain in the study to complete the assessments scheduled for the EOT /ET visit and complete 
Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section 4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal assessments for which the patient consents.  
If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144655]. Data collected from the patient can continue to be used. 
Note, in countries where the collection and processing of the patient’s personal data is based on 
consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process his/her personal data (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), as applicable, personal data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as 
appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases ) can be included 
after withdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by [CONTACT_1769].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data or Objection to 
Process Patient’s Personal Data  
Where allowed by [CONTACT_1769], the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, and 
use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the study doctor at any 
time in writing or in any other form that may be locally require d. Also, where allowed by [CONTACT_49762], the patient may object to the collection, storage, and use of his/her personal data, informing 
the study doctor at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required. In both 
cases, the Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information (including any 
data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samples until the time of withdrawal/objection) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as applicable,  further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study 
The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. However, study integrity and interpretation are 
best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study  assessments and follow-up even if study 
drug is discontinued. 
Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section 8.1.6. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Reason for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation 
The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible. If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section 6.5.6.

• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_144695], and/or should 
continue in the study. 
• Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or loc al 
equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s medical record.  
• Should the patient continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study. 
• For patients who are lost to follow-up, the Investigator can search publicly available records (where permitted and allowed by [CONTACT_1769]) to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible.

(including but not limited to unusual clumsiness, gait abnormalities, and unexplained 
balance/coordination issues that are either absent at or worsening from the baseline) should be reported as an AE. If the treatment -emergent AE is persistent and considered related to study 
drug, specialty consultation with a neurologist should be considered. However, if such a treatment -emergent AE is serious or severe (regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of 
relatedness), the patient must be referred for neurologist consultation, and study drug dosing 
must be held until that consultation is complete. Resumption of dosing must be approved by [CONTACT_5134]. 
5.2.6. Preparation, Handling, and Storage 
Staff at each clinical study center will be responsible for preparation of ALN -AGT01 or placebo 
doses according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. No special procedures for the 
safe handling of study drug are required. 
ALN-AGT01 will be stored at approximately 2 to 30°C until dose preparation. Deviations from 
the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor and use of ALN- AGT01 
halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided by [CONTACT_16015], as 
described in the Pharmacy Manual. 
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
Instructions specific to unused study drug and additional storage will be provided in the

5.3. Clinical Product Complaints  
5.3.1. Definition  
A clinical product complaint (CPC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of the study drug and its packaging after it is released for distribution to the site at which study drug will be administered. 
A CPC may be detected prior to use of study drug, during use, or after use. A CPC is typi[INVESTIGATOR_144657]; however, it is possible that study drug complaints could be associated with 
an AE. Examples of a CPC include, but are not limited to: illegible clinical label, missing clinical 
label, damaged vial, empty vial, and contamination of study drug. 
5.3.2. Reporting  
For product complaints, the Sponsor or its designee should be notified within [ADDRESS_164694] be 
evaluated and reported as indicated in Section  6.5.6. Detailed instructions on reporting CPCs will 
be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.4. Monitoring for Potential Clinical Events  
5.4.1. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hypotension 
Hypotension is an obligate risk of antihypertensive medications. In addition to office blood 
pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure should be monitored weekly with HBPM to 
ensure the early detection of potential hypotension. Whenever possible, mana gement decisions 
will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698]. 
The following management recommendations for hypotension are provided: 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164695] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  44 • Low blood pressure that is associated with symptoms should promptly be evaluated at 
the clinical study site or another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Clinical study site evaluation for low blood pressure should include the assessment of orthostatic blood pressure (eg, supi[INVESTIGATOR_144658]).  
• The Investigator should consider downtitration, interruption, or discontinuation of oral antihypertensives (if taking) if confirmed office SBP <90 mmHg or if clinical symptoms, such as lightheadedness or dizziness, develop coupled with a significantly lowe r SBP compared to prior visits (ie, SBP <100 mmHg). 
• Clinically significant events discovered during the course of a patient’s general medical care should be promptly communicated to the site and evaluated by [CONTACT_737], especially if hypotension is noted. Patients will carry Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) -approved patient cards to facilitate this physician- to-physician 
communication.  
• If hypotension is confirmed, serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured and any oral antihypertensive(s) previously started for hypertensive escape should be down-titrated, interrupted, or discontinued per Investigator judgement.  
• The frequency of blood pressure and biochemical monitoring (serum electrolytes and creatinine) should be increased during intercurrent illnesses that predispose patients to 
dehydration (eg, vomiting or diarrhea that persists for more than 24 hours) or when 
symptoms consistent with decreased effective circulating volume (eg, presyncopal symptoms, unexplained falls, decreased urine output) manifest, even if a patient’s recent blood pressure measurements have been normal.  
• Hypotension that warrants direct evaluation at the site should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours. In addition, other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (eg, unexplained presyncope, syncope, or falls) should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the site being notified. 
• Management of persistent hypotension may include increased salt intake or, if unresponsive, standard treatments for orthostatic intolerance syndromes such as fludrocortisone or midodrine. 
• Low blood pressure that requires medical treatment (including intravenous fluid support) or other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (see above) should be recorded as AEs. 
5.4.2. Monitoring and Approach for Clinically Significant Blood Pressure Elevation 
In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored frequently with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential significant elevations. Whenever 
possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by 
[CONTACT_144698]. The recommended interventions for potentially clinically significant blood pressure elevation are presented in Table 4.

Pressure Elevation  
Study Period  Intervention  
Throughout Study • Whenever possible, management decisions should be based on blood 
pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698].  
• Any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg 
and/or office DBP ≥120 mmHg) should be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
• Because ALN -AGT01 acts on the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS 
inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue 
agents for high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study.  
• If added, oral antihypertensives must be used per their labeled instructions 
and in accordance with current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 
2018] 
Day 1 to Month 3 Intervene if clinically significant blood pressure elevation: 
• Because of the gradual onset of effects of ALN-AGT01, interventions for 
asymptomatic hypertension should be avoided in the first 6 weeks after the 
patient’s first administration of study drug.  
• After Week 6, patients who develop office SBP >160 mmHg and increased 
>10 mmHg from their baseline office SBP that persists for ≥24 hours on 2 
consecutive measurements or that is accompanied by [CONTACT_144699]. Severely 
symptomatic patients should be evaluated at the clinical study site or another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144659] 24 hours. 
• If persistent hypertension is confirmed (without the identification of a 
specific treatable cause) and the Investigator deems it to be a clinically significant change, treatment may be initiated at the medical discretion of the Investigator using a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic. 
Investigators should avoid long-acting agents that may not fully washout 
between Month 5 and Month 6. 
Months 3 to 6 Treat to target blood pressure using a CCB and/or thiazide/thiazide- like diure tic: 
• At Month 3, a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic may be added if 
the daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by [CONTACT_44117]. If the Investigator feels there is a compelling clinical reason to wait, the rationale for exception should be documented in the eCRF. 
• After Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per 
Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above 
recommended target per treatment guidelines (eg, office SBP <140 mmHg, 
HBPM SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP by [CONTACT_44117] <135 
mmHg). [Williams 2018] 
• A temporary hold of oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be performed in 
appropriate patients (below) from Month 5 to Month 6: 
­ Month 5 office S
BP <160 mmHg if taking no oral antihypertensive 
agents

• During this 4-week period, blood pressure will be carefully monitored by 
[CONTACT_144700] >170  mmHg (or if confirmed office SBP >160 mmHg accompanied by 
[CONTACT_23805])  
Month 6 to End of 
Study Treat to target blood pressure using Investigator’s choice of oral 
antihypertensive(s ). 
• At Month 6, prior oral antihypertensive may be restarted per Investigator 
judgement if daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by [CONTACT_44117].  
• Oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per Investigator 
judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above recommended 
target per treatment guidelines (eg, office SBP <140 mmHg; HBPM SBP 
<135 mmHg; daytime mean SBP by [CONTACT_44117] <135 mmHg). [Whelton 2018 ; 
Williams 2018 ] 
5.4.3. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Renal Dysfunction 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of eGFR 
through the anticipated onset of initial ALN-AGT01 PD. Based upon the renal dysfunction 
associated with conventional RAAS inhibitors,[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] the following 
guidelines apply throughout the study: 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥30% from baseline or to 
≤30 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, contact 
[CONTACT_1034], and look for potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction such as: 
− NSAIDs, antibiotics, or other treatments known to impair renal function 
− Recent exposure to intravenous contrast agents 
− Hypotension 
− Hypovolemia 
− Urinary infection 
− Urinary tract obstruction 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥40% from baseline or to 
≤25 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, look for 
potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction, and contact [CONTACT_144701]. Serum creatinine should be monitored at least weekly until improving.  
• If a patient is on additional oral antihypertensive agents, the Investigator should consider whether these agents should be interrupted, especially during intercurrent illness or volume depletion

Use of concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1). Concomitant medications include all 
prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the counter medications, vitamins, and 
minerals. Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the eCRF. 
Standard vitamins and topi[INVESTIGATOR_144660]. However, topi[INVESTIGATOR_144661](s) unless medically indicated. For permitted concomitant medications administered SC, do not administer in same injectio n site area as the study drug for

Patients receiving low -dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (defined as ≤100 mg per day) for at least [ADDRESS_164703] 2 days prior to ABPM and office blood pressure measurements, and alternative analgesics (acetaminophen, topi[INVESTIGATOR_35791]) 
should be considered.[ Whelton 2018] When used, the dosing of systemic NSAIDs should be at 
the lower end of the labeled range and for the shortest duration possible.  
Patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) should 
be on a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to screening and during the study treatment period. 
These medications should not be initiated or discontinued, if possible, during the study treatment period.  
Patients will be allowed to receive vaccines (eg, for SARS -CoV- 2) that have received health 
agency authorization (including for emergency use) by [CONTACT_144703]. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by [CONTACT_3786], except as described in Section 5.5.2. However, it is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded on the eCRF. Concomitant medication will be coded using an internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary. 
5.5.1. Oral Antihypertensive Medication  
Individual initiation and modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator 
judgement are permitted throughout the study if required to treat clinically significant blood 
pressure elevation (Section  5.4.2). In addition, after a patient completes the placebo-controlled 
primary endpoint at Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per 
Investigator judgment for persistent elevations in blood pressure above recommended target per 
treatment g uidelines (eg, office SBP <140 mmHg, HBPM SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean 
SBP by [CONTACT_44117] <135 mmHg). [Williams 2018 ] All oral antihypertensive medication that are 
dosed once daily should be taken in the morning. 
Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured at a central or local laboratory

Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  49 5.5.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medication  
The following medications, treatments, and supplements are prohibited throughout the study 
treatment period (until the EOT visit): 
• Conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors)  
• Prescription NSAIDs  
• Organic nitrate preparations (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, pentaerythritol)  
• An RNAi therapeutic (other than ALN- AGT01)  
• Medications, herbal supplements (including Ma Huang and St. John’s wort), or other 
substances (such as licorice) that are associated with increases in LFT abnormalities 
or with blood pressure abnormalities are prohibited. This includes certain stimulants (eg, amphetamine, methylphenidate dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine), MAO 
inhibitors, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709] (eg, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), diet pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (eg, 
phenylpropanolamine, sibutramine), and nasal decongestants (eg, phenylephrine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine, naphazoline hydrochloride), unless individually approved by [CONTACT_144704]. 
• Medications, herbal medicines, over- the-counter medications, or supplements known 
to cause hyperkalemia are prohibited unless individually approved by [CONTACT_144704]. This includes potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium suppl ements, cyclo -oxygenase-[ADDRESS_164705] dose, throughout study participation, and through safety follow- up (if applicable; see Section  3.1).  
Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include: 
• Placement of an intrauterine device.  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164706] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  50 • Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient). 
• Established use of oral (except low-dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or 
transdermal hormonal methods of contraception associated with the inhibition of 
ovulation. 
• True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent 
patients must agree to use one of the above-mentioned contraceptive methods if they 
start heterosexual relationships during the study and through safety follow- up (if 
applicable; Section  3.1).  
Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. 
Females of child -bearing potential include female patients who have experienced menarche (or 
begin menarche over the course of the study), and who are not postmenopausal or permanently 
sterilized (eg, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]). A postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause, confirmed by [CONTACT_144705].  
For male patients, no contraception is required. However, use by [CONTACT_144706] 
(condom) may be required in some countries, eg, [LOCATION_009], in order to comply with local 
requirements as described in the corresponding patient ICFs.  
Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144707] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Pregnancy testing will be 
performed before every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of the study (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.2. Alcohol Restrictions  
Patients should limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 units per day (unit: 1 glass of wine [approximately 125 mL] =1 measure of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_2120] [approximately 1 fluid ounce] =½ pi[INVESTIGATOR_43924] [approximately 284 mL]) for the duration 
of the study. Compliance with alcohol restrictions should be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144708]. 
5.7.3. Tobacco and Nicotine Restrictions  
Use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing 
tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e-cigarettes) must be avoided within [ADDRESS_164707] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, [ADDRESS_164708] 1 week prior to screening 
assessments of blood pressure. Of note, this is the sodium intake recommended in the 2018 
European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension Guidelines for both hypertensive patients and for the general population.[ Williams 2018 ]  
On days on which samples for fasting lipid panel and glycemic assessments are collected, patients are required to fast for ≥10 hours before sample collection (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.5. Exercise  
Patients should abstain from strenuous exercise for [ADDRESS_164709] es and measurement of vital 
signs (including blood pressure assessments) and weight (at the discretion of the Investigator). See further details in Section  10.2. 
6.1. Screening Assessments  
An ICF that has been approved by [CONTACT_144709] (IRB)/IEC must be signed (in paper or electronic format per local regulations and institutional standards) by [CONTACT_144710]. All patients will be given a copy of the 
signed and dated ICF. 
Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria. Rescreening of patients is permitted with consultation of the Medical Monitor 
(see Section  6.1.2).  
Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained. Any changes to 
medical history occurring between the screening assessment and Day [ADDRESS_164710] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  52 6.1.1. Retesting  
If in the Investigator’s judgement, the screening laboratory abnormalities are likely to be 
transient, then laboratory tests may be repeated. The Investigator’s rationale should be 
documented. Laboratory values can be retested once during screening provide d that the patient 
can be evaluated for eligibility after at least 2 to 4 weeks of washout (as applicable) and 
randomized within the allowed Screening period. Retesting of screening ABPM is permitted 
once if the first screening ABPM is invalid. A valid screening ABPM recording must be obtained within [ADDRESS_164711] recent ABPM result obtained. If a valid ABPM reading that meets the inclusion criterion is unable to be 
obtained within 2 weeks prior to randomization, the patient is a screen failure. 
6.1.2. Rescreening  
A patient who does not meet all study eligibility criteria due to a transient condition observed at 
screening (eg, prohibited medications that were subsequently discontinued) will be allowed to 
return once for rescreening. A patient will be re-consented if rescreening occurs outside of the 60-day screening window. In this case, all screening procedures must be repeated. 
6.2. Efficacy Assessments 
All blood pressure measurements (ABPM, office, and HBPM) must be taken using the standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in Section  10.1.  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives, a washout of at least 2 to 4 weeks (as applicable) must be completed prior to measurement of the baseline ABPM (for eligibility) and baseline office blood pressure. The baseline ABPM and office blood pressure must be measured within 2 weeks 
before randomization. An HBPM unit will be provided during the Screening period to facilitate 
monitoring during the washout of prior oral antihypertensives (if taking) and to establish the HBPM baseline prior to randomization. To establish baseline, [ADDRESS_164712] week immediately prior to randomization. 
ABPM placement may be performed at home by [CONTACT_144711], as detailed in 
the ABPM Investigator Manual. If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood 
pressure assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained 
remotely using the methods described in Section 10.1. 
Recommendations for approach and monitoring of low blood pressure/hypotension and 
hypertensive escape are provided in Section 5.4.1 and Section  5.4.2, respectively. 
6.2.1. ABPM  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as rescue medication), ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication.  
Validity will be assessed for all ABPMs. If the ABPM recording is invalid at any point during 
the study, the patient will be provided [ADDRESS_164713] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, [ADDRESS_164714] be measured using the automated blood pressure device provided by 
[CONTACT_144712] (prior to taking oral antihypertensives) and at approximately the same time each day; therefore, visits should be scheduled at approximately the same time of day, whenever possible. Office blood pressure must include orthostatic measurements (seated and standing).  
Exercise, caffeine, alcohol consumption, and use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products 
(including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or 
e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 minutes prior to blood pressure measurements. The use 
of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, 
tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) sho uld be avoided within [ADDRESS_164715]/caffeine or taking morning oral medications. HBPM is not required on days when ABPM is being assessed. 
The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet flat on the floor as 
detailed in Section  10.[ADDRESS_164716] sites will be given the option of using a wearable blood pressure 
sensor for 2 periods of 2 to 4 weeks each according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). 
Wearable blood pressure assessments performed during screening should be obtained during the 
last [ADDRESS_164717] as described in the Biobeat Investigator Manual, using the opposite arm as that used for ABPM. 
6.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples for determination of AGT and RAAS biomarkers (plasma renin concentration, AngI, AngII, and aldosterone) will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1). Blood samples for PD assessments must be collected before study drug administration 
(on days when study drug is to be dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  54 drug dosing (on other days). Blood AGT levels will be analyzed at a central laboratory by 
[CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent assay for measurement of PD effect. These biomarkers may be 
analyzed using validated assays. Details regarding the collection, processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and 
storage of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Results will not be used to adjust dosing of ALN-AGT01 or guide clinical management and will 
not be shared with sites until after the last patient completes Month 12. If clinical circumstances arise for which such information is required to guide patient c are, local laboratory assessments 
should be drawn. 
6.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for the assessment of plasma concentrations of ALN -AGT01 
and its primary metabolite AS(N -1)3′ ALN -AGT01 at the time points indicated in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ). A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples 
for PK analysis is in Table 2. 
Plasma concentrations of ALN -AGT01 and AS(N- 1)3′ ALN -AGT01 will be determined using a 
validated assay. Details regarding sample volumes to be collected, and the processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the study will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs, including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and laboratory tests. Clinically significant abnormalities 
observed during the physical examination are recorded. 
6.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) and include 
office blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. When vital signs and 
blood sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs should be performed before blood samples are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be measured predose in the seated 
position, after the patient has rested comfortably for approximately 5 minutes. Body temperature 
in degrees Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, forehead, or axillary methods. Heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_144662] a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. Blood pressure is described in 
Section  6.2.  
Additional vital sign assessments, as medially indicated, may be added at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
Vital signs results will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5.2. Weight, Height, and Morphometrics 
Height and body weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded in the eCRF. Height will be measured at screening 
only. Height will be measured in centimeters. Body weight should be measured in kilograms to 
the first decimal point in patients wearing light clothing and without shoes.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164719] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, [ADDRESS_164720] -to-hip- ratio will also be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded on the eCRF. For waist circumference and waist -to-
hip ratio, patients should wear minimal clothing to ensure that the measuring tape is correctly 
positioned. Patients should stand erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, feet together 
and with their weight equally divided over both legs. To perform the waist measurement, the 
lowest rib margin is first located and marked with a pen. The iliac crest is then palpated in the midaxillary line, and also marked. It is recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally 
midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in 
position around the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus. The elastic tape thus defines the level of the waist circumference, which can then be measured by [CONTACT_144713]. Hip circumference measurement should be taken around the widest portion 
of the buttocks. Patients are asked to breathe normally, and to breathe out gently at the time of the measurement to prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding their breath. A 
stretch -resistant tape that provides a constant [ADDRESS_164721] centimeter and entered in the source document. Each 
measurement should be repeated twice; if the measurements are within 1 cm of each other, the average should be calculated. If the difference between the 2 measurements exceeds 1 cm, the 2 measurements should be repeated.  
6.5.3. Physical Examination 
Full and symptom-directed physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ); if a physical examination is scheduled for a dosing visit, it should be 
conducted prior to dosing. Full physical examinations will include the examination of the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascul ar, 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and 
neurological status (see the Recommended Neurological Assessments for All Physical 
Examinations document for further details on the assessments to be performed as part of the neurological evaluation). 
Symptom-directed physical examinations will be guided by [CONTACT_144714], 
or the onset of new symptoms, since the last visit. Neurological evaluation should be performed during all symptom- directed physical examinations regardless of whet her neurological 
symptoms have been experienced by [CONTACT_102].  
Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on 
the medical history or AE eCRF. 
6.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead ECGs reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, 
and QT interval and Fridericia- corrected QT interval will be obtained using a local machine, as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients should be supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_164722] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  56 determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be recorded in the 
eCRF.   
When ECG and blood sample collection for RAAS biomarkers (renin, aldosterone, and Ang I/II) occur at the same visit, and where feasible, blood sample collection should occur first. ECGs should be performed at least [ADDRESS_164723] changed since the baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These 
assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of 
the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
6.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory. Specific 
instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. For any other 
unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, 
or as per DMC advice, until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis 
is made to adequately explain the abnormality. Additional safety laboratories and assessments as indicated by [CONTACT_144715]. Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in Table 6 and will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).  
While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical decisions, on the day of the assessments all laboratory assessments specified in Table 6 which are performed at the clinic 
should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory. In the case of discrepant local and central 
laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day, central laboratory results will be relied upon for clinical decisions. 
Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical study center or at home by a 
trained healthcare professional. Blood samples collected for RAAS biomarkers should be collected in the morning and in the seated/upright position (after blood pr essure measurements 
and before any assessments collected in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]). 
Spot urine collections for albumin and creatinine should be obtained in the morning.  
For any safety event or laboratory abnormality, additional laboratory assessments, imaging, and 
consultation may be performed for clinical evaluation and/or in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor; results may be collected and should be included in the cl inical database.

fasting plasma glucose, insulin, lipid panel, and HbA1c. Samples should be collected at approximately the same time of day (±2 hours). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunogenicity  
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Blood samples for ADA 
testing must be collected before study drug administration (on days when study drug is to be 
dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing (on other days) as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). A blood sample to evaluate ADA will be 
collected at the ET visit, if applicable. Blood samples for ADA will be analyzed at a central laboratory. 
Details regarding the processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and analysis of the samples will be provided in the 
Laboratory Manual. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Testing  
A pregnancy test will be performed for females of child -bearing potential. A serum pregnancy 
test will be performed at screening, and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per 
the Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is suspected. More frequent pregnancy 
testing may be performed where required per local requirements. The results of the pregnancy test must be known before study drug administration. Patients who are pregnant at screening are 
not eligible for study participation. Any woman with a positive urine pregnancy test, 
subsequently confirmed by a positive serum pregnancy test, during the study will be discontinued from study drug but will continue to be followed for safety. Patients determined to 
be pregnant while on study will be followed at least until the pregnancy outcome is known (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for follow -up instructions). 
A blood sample will be drawn at screening to measure the levels of follicle stimulating hormone 
in order to confirm postmenopausal status in all women suspected to be postmenopausal (see

6.5.6. Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and [ADDRESS_164727] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164728] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  60 • Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144663] (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse). 
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest: 
• ALT or AST >3×ULN  
• Severe or serious ISRs; ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or those that lead to temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of ALN-AGT01. 
An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection. “At or near” the 
injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as 
may occur with swelling or hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the 
injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not considered an ISR. 
For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section  [IP_ADDRESS], respectively.  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
Moderate:  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money). 
Severe:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding 
self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden); OR life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; OR death related to an adverse event. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164729] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, [ADDRESS_164730] to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity. Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Adverse event severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the 
intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE).  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Drug  
The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by [CONTACT_144716] a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]?” A “yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to the study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in the patient’s health since the 
last visit. The patient should also be asked if the patient has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, 
used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and over-the-counter). In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any 
clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other 
findings that are relevant to patient saf ety. 
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by [CONTACT_144717]. Non- serious AEs will be  followed until the end of study. 
Events occurring after signing of the ICF and before study drug administration will be captured as medical history (see Section  6.1), while AEs that occur after study drug administration, and 
baseline events that worsen after study drug administration, must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by [CONTACT_144718]. SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by [CONTACT_144719], as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug- related. Each AE must be described in 
detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken, 
and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) in the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164731] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, [ADDRESS_164732] (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the supplemental AEs of 
Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed. Additional clinical and laboratory information may 
be collected. Refer to CRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF.  
For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or Symptoms eCRF, recording additional information regarding each injection site reaction that is entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom(s), injection site location, follow-up actions taken, etc). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the Sponsor or its designee 
should be notified within 24 hours using the appropriate eCRF. [IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737]. Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee immediately and no later than [ADDRESS_164733] the following information: 
• Patient’s study number 
• Description and date of onset of the event 
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug, and 
• Investigator/site information  
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. Immediately and no 
later than [ADDRESS_164734] update the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form.  
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by [CONTACT_144720]/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE. These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should be recorded. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by [CONTACT_144721]. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by [CONTACT_144722].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations.

Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  63 [IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the IRB/IEC per their 
institutional policy by [CONTACT_9304] (or Sponsor designee) according to country 
requirements. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_16211]/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through safety follow-up (Section 3.1), the 
Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_164736] dose of study drug. 
The pregnancy should be followed by [CONTACT_144723]. At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE 
as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overdose and Other Special Situations Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose of study drug administered to the participant or taken by [CONTACT_144724] >2× the assigned dose during a single administration and/or ≥2 doses within ½ 
the intended dosing interval. 
The Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  
In an event of an overdose or other special situations (eg, medication error, abuse, misuse, CPC 
associated with an AE), the Investigator should: 
• Contact [CONTACT_27909] 24 hours  
• Submit the special situations reporting form within [ADDRESS_164737] information in the Pharmacy Manual 
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities 
• Document the amount of study drug given  
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication will be considered AEs/SAEs.  
Full details of overdose and other special situations reporting instructions will be outlined in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and Biospecimen Repository  
Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144664]. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164738] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, [ADDRESS_164739]. More generally, genetic variations may account for the 
well-described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with hypertension, as well as 
their responses to treatment.  
Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and patient consent, samples will be collected as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the 
application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may further eluc idate the outcomes of this 
study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or efficacy of ALN -AGT01. 
Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1). These specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory. Potential exploratory 
investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progression, efficacy, or safety. 
The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety 
laboratory samples, PK samples, etc) that are obtained during the study. 
These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following 
the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations. After [ADDRESS_164740] elapsed, samples will be destroyed. 
Details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_144665]. 
Exploratory analysis of these biospecimens will be performed by [CONTACT_144725].  
When biobanking is permitted by [CONTACT_1295], study participants will be advised during the 
informed consent process of these biobanking details and the potential for exploratory 
investigation of their samples.  
7. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock and unblinding for the 
primary analysis. The plan will detail the implementation of the statistical analyses in accordance 
with the principle features stated in the protocol. 
7.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_164741]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg, and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sample size of 375 patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response signal in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2- sided significance level of 
0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_164742] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)

Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  74 10. APPENDICES  
10.1. Measurement of Blood Pressure  
All blood pressure measurements (office, ABPM, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in the relevant user manuals.  
The appropriately sized cuff for each modality must be used for all assessments. The arm’s 
circumference at midpoint (halfway between the acromion and olecranon) should be determined 
at screening with a metric tape measure and used to select the appropriat ely sized blood pressure 
cuff/bladder for each instrument as described in the ABPM Investigator Manual and the HBPM 
and OBPM Investigator Manual. Unless significant weight loss or gain occurs between visits, the patient should use the same cuff/bladder size throughout the study. 
At the first Screening visit only, office blood pressure will be measured in both arms to select the 
appropriate arm to use for office blood pressure and HBPM measurements. Unless a concomitant 
condition favors the use of a specific arm, the arm with the higher office SBP should be used for 
all subsequent office blood pressure and HBPM readings. The ABPM should be measured using the patient’s nondominant arm. If the patient is ambidextrous, the same arm used for office blood pressure and HBPM readings should be used. 
ABPM  
The appropriately sized cuff should be placed on the correct arm following the instructions in the 
ABPM Investigator Manual. In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as 
rescue medication), ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication. All ABPM collections must be in the outpatient/ambulatory state. During screening, 
ABPM recording must be obtained within [ADDRESS_164762] be obtained in advance of the visit (within 
7 days before the corresponding dosing visit) and the results reviewed prior to dosing. 
During the 24-hour monitoring period, patients must avoid strenuous exercise but should 
otherwise maintain their usual level of physical activity. The ABPM is programmed to take readings every 20 minutes during the day (6 am to 9:59 pm) and every 30 minutes during the 
night (10 pm to 5:59 am). While awake, the patient should hold their arm still by [CONTACT_144736] a reading. Patients must record the timing of going to sleep, waking up, and any oral medications taken during the ABPM, and these responses must be entered into the eCRF.  
After the monitoring period is complete, upload the ABPM data to receive a report with validity assessment. An ABPM will be considered valid if (1) the number of successful daytime readings 
is ≥33, (2) the number of successful nighttime readings is ≥11, and (3) no more than 3 hours are 
not represented (ie, 3 sections of 60 minutes where 0 valid readings were obtained). If the ABPM recording is invalid at any point during the study, the patient will be provided [ADDRESS_164763] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, [ADDRESS_164764] be measured using the automated blood pressure device provided by 
[CONTACT_144737]. 
Office blood pressure should be measured early in the visit prior to the morning dose of 
antihypertensive medication, before phlebotomy or other potentially stressful assessments. To 
minimize confounding by [CONTACT_144738], study visits should be scheduled for a consistent timeframe of the day. The use of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 
hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 
inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) should be avoided within 48 hours prior to measuring blood pressure. 
Before measuring blood pressure, confirm that there has been no exercise or use of caffeine or 
nicotine- or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e- cigarettes) with in the last [ADDRESS_164765] blood pressure measurements, ask the patient to use the bathroom before the assessment. 
All office blood pressure assessments will include both seated and standing measurements.  
Seated Office Blood Pressure Measurement:  For seat
 ed measurements, the patient should be in a 
comfortable resting position in a chair with their back supported and their feet flat on the floor. 
• Place the appropriately sized cuff on the correct arm with no clothing between the 
patient’
s arm and the cuff and with the midpoint of the bladder length positioned over 
the brachial artery (located by [CONTACT_23302]). The arm should be supported on an armrest or table with mid -cuff at heart level and the palm facing the ceiling.  
• Follow the HBPM and OBPM Investigator Manual to initiate the automated blood pressure device’s seated measurement protocol. This program includes a [ADDRESS_164766] 3 individual measurements.  
• During the device’s seated measurement protocol, the staff member should leave the room and the patient should remain at rest without distraction (avoid mobile phones). The following script may be used: “The blood pressure device works best when you 
are at  rest and without any distraction. If you agree, I would like to leave the room for 
the next [ADDRESS_164767], followed by [CONTACT_2902] 5 minutes of the device inflating to measure your blood pressure”.  
Standing Office Blood Pressure Measurement: A standing measurement should be obtained 
immediately after collection of the seated measurements.  
• Being careful to maintain the cuff’s position, ask the patient to stand with the cuffed arm bent s
lightly and the hand of the cuffed arm supported at heart level.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164768] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 6, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  76 • Using a stopwatch or watch, measure standing blood pressure 1 minute after standing 
by [CONTACT_144739]’s single measurement protocol.  
• After the standing measurement, ask the patient if they experienced dizziness or light-headedness when standing and enter their response in the eCRF. 
If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained remotely by a visiting nurse or other appropriately trained personnel who will bring an office blood pressure instrument to the 
patient’s location and follow the same procedure performed at the site. If a home visit is not 
possible, a “remote visit blood pressure measurement” should instead be obtained using the patient’s HBPM instrument under direct supervision (phone call or teleconferencing) by 
[CONTACT_144740], following the instructions detailed in the HBPM and OBPM 
Investigator Manual. Results and the remote method used should be entered into the eCRF. 
HBPM  
Patients should measure HBPM in the morning, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning 
oral medications. HBPM is not required on days when ABPM is being assessed. The HBPM measurement should be obtained in a room without distractions, seated comfortably with the 
back supported and feet flat on the floor. The patient will initiate the automated blood pressure 
program on their HBPM device. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by [ADDRESS_164769] 3 individual measurements.  
To establish baseline, each patient should measure HBPM during the week (with at least 3 
successful readings) immediately prior to randomization. 
After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at least once per week. Patients may select the day of 
the week that is most convenient for their personal schedule. The frequency of HBPM may be increased in some patients, per Investigator discretion, if more frequent measurement is 
warranted (eg, during screening if patients are undergoing washout and during the temporary 
hold of oral antihypertensives performed from Month 5 to Month 6). 
10.2. Procedures for Optional Home Healthcare Visits  
Home healthcare may be allowed where applicable country and local regulations and 
infrastructure for home healthcare allow and will follow procedures that are in compliance with 
relevant local regulations and guidelines (eg, General Data Protection Regulation [EU (European Union) no 2016/679], ICH E6[R2], and the Declaration of Helsinki). The use of home healthcare 
is optional and will not be utilized for visits at which study drug is administered or at visits that 
are required to be performed at the site (see Table  1).  
The option for home healthcare aims to improve patient diversity, participation, engagement, and 
retention in the study by [CONTACT_144741]- related travel to the site, 
allowing flexibility in the study visit schedule.  
For clinical study sites where home healthcare is utilized, the Investigator will retain responsibility for oversight, patient safety, and conduct of the trial, and will be responsible for 
reviewing the qualifications of and approving each home healthcare professional, delegating responsibilities to the home healthcare professional in the site delegation log, providing

I have read the ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164776] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_164777] a daytime mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥135 mmHg and ≤[ADDRESS_164778]-AGT01 is an SC administered N -acetylgalactosamine -conjugated small interfering RNA 
targeting liver -expressed messenger RNA for angiotensinogen (AGT). 
Patients randomized to receive ALN -AGT01 will be administered [ADDRESS_164779]-AGT01 beginning at Month 6.  
Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Placebo (sodium chloride 0.9% w/v for SC administration) will be administered once every [ADDRESS_164780] -AGT01 is up to 36 months. The estimated total time on 
study for each patient is up to 47 months, including up to 2 months of screening, followed by [CONTACT_25765] 36 months of treatment, and up to 12 months in the Follow-up period. 
Statistical Methods  
The planned enrollment for this study is 375 patients. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] 
(black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] (mean 24- hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg). 
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_164781]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg, and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sam ple size of 
375 patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response signal in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2-sided significance 
level of 0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_164782] -AGT01 dose versus placebo with a 2-sided significance 
level of 0.05.  
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows:  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by- treatment analyses based on the FAS will be according to the 
randomized treatment arm.  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug, grouped 
according to the treatment actually received.  
• Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Set : All patients who received at least [ADDRESS_164783] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  8 • PD Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of study drug. All by-
treatment analyses based on the PD Analysis Set will be grouped according to the 
treatment actually received.  
• All ALN- AGT01 Treated Set:  All patients who received any amount of [ADDRESS_164784]-AGT01 throughout the entire DB period (including DB extension period). 
To control the overall type I error, the primary and key secondary endpoints will be tested in 
hierarchical order.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  23 1. INTRODUCTION 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Sponsor) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_144647]-AGT01 (zilebesiran), a 
subcutaneously (SC) administered investigational agent comprised of a synthetic small 
interfering (siRNA) covalently linked to a triantennary N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand, 
which is designed to suppress liver production of angiotensinogen (AGT) and thereby [CONTACT_144682].  
1.1. Study Rationale  
Study ALN- AGT01 -002 (KARDIA -1) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-
ranging, multicenter Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ALN- AGT01, administered SC, in patients with mild -to-moderate 
hypertension. Patients will be randomized to [ADDRESS_164800] 6 months of the 12-month Double-blind (DB) period. After the first [ADDRESS_164801]-AGT01 open- label 
extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reaches Month [ADDRESS_164802] on systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 
Month 3, as assessed by [CONTACT_46674] (ABPM). Secondary and 
exploratory objectives of the study include evaluating the efficacy of ALN -AGT01 on other 
measures of blood pressure response and evaluating the PD effect of ALN-AGT01, including 
reduction in circulating AGT concentration. 
The full rationale for the study and design is presented in Section 3.2. 
1.2. Background  
Hypertension affects 30% to 45% of adults and is the strongest modifiable risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction.[ Olsen 2016; Williams 2018 ] 
The worldwide disease burden is profound, with a global prevalence of over 1 billion,[ Kearney 
2005; NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017] and approximately 9 million deaths attributed to hypertension annually.[ Angell 2015] 
Currently available pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144648] a minority of patients, due in large part to physician inertia and patient nonadherence to daily oral medication. [Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Low adherence to oral antihypertensives is 
associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes and is prevalent at all stages of disease. [Corrao 
2011; Peacock and Krousel -Wood 2017; Schulz 2016; van der Laan 2017] Thus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_144669], current rates of control are low, and the global burden 
of death and disability- adjusted life -years attributed to elevated blood pressure remains 
high.[ Forouzanfar 2017; Muntner 2020] Development of new approaches to treat hypertension 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164803] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  24 and to overcome the limitations of current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217] a key unmet need.[ Dzau and Balatbat 
2019; McClellan 2019; Services 2020] 
The Sponsor is developi[INVESTIGATOR_144647]-AGT01, a novel synthetic RNA interference (RNAi) 
therapeutic, for SC administration for the treatment of hypertension. RNAi is a naturally 
occurring cellular mechanism for regulation of gene expression, mediated through the binding of 
siRNA to its complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, leading to mRNA cleavage and subsequent suppression of the synthesis and levels of the target protein. ALN- AGT01 
contains an siRNA targeting AGT  mRNA, conjugated to a GalNAc-containing liga nd to facilitate 
delivery to the liver. Based on the mechanism of RNAi, ALN-AGT01 is specifically designed to reduce the hepatic synthesis of AGT protein, the first substrate in the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sole precursor of vasoactive angiotensin peptides.[ Khanna 
2017; Romero 2015] Because hepatocytes are the predominant source of circulating AGT, 
ALN-AGT01 has been developed to reduce blood pressure by [CONTACT_144742] (AngII). 
Preliminary data from Part A of the ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_164804]- AGT01 -001 (hereafter referred 
to as Study 001) in patients with hypertension have shown that single SC doses of ALN- AGT01 
lead to dose-dependent and durable reductions in circulating AGT, accompanied by [CONTACT_144685] (DBP). Reductions in AGT for up to [ADDRESS_164805] adverse events (AEs) have been mild or moderate in severity, and there have been no 
severe or serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study drug. There have been no clinically significant elevations in serum creatinine or serum potassium, and no patient has required 
intervention for low blood pressure. No clinically significant alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
elevations have been observed in Part A patients who received ALN-AGT01 doses as high as 800 mg. Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported in a minority of patients and were all mild and transient events that resolved without intervention. 
This Phase [ADDRESS_164806]-AGT01 across a 
range of doses (150 to 600 mg) and dose intervals (once every 3 months and once every 6 
months) to identify optimal treatment. The consistent and prolonged PD effec t of ALN -AGT01 
is expected to achieve the unique benefit of continuous 24-hour blood pressure lowering with 
infrequent SC dosing.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ALN-AGT01 is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
Clinical data available from Study [ADDRESS_164807] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  28 monitoring [HBPM] SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP <135 mmHg by 
[CONTACT_44117]). [Williams 2018 ] Oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be temporarily held from Month 
5 to Month 6 in appropriate patients (Month 5 office SBP <155 mmHg if taking 1 oral 
antihypertensive agent or office SBP <150 mmHg if taking 2 agents) to assess the effect of 
ALN- AGT01  alone (vs placebo) at Month 6 by [CONTACT_44117]. During this 4-week period, blood 
pressure will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144686] >170 mmHg (or if confirmed office SBP >160 mmHg accompanied by [CONTACT_23805]). 
Patients may be eligible to participate in an ALN -AGT01 OLE study upon completion of the 
Month 12 predose assessments. If an individual patient reaches Month 12 prior to availability of 
the OLE study, they may continue their current blinded dosing in the DB Extension period for up 
to 24 additional months until the OLE study is open and then transition. Once the OLE study is open for enrollment, eligible patients may rollover into the OLE study at Months 12, 18, 24, 30, or 36 (whichever visit occurs first). 
In the DB Extension period, blood pressure will be closely monitored and individual 
modification of antihypertensive therapy will be allowed to maintain blood pressure in target range.  
Safety Follow- up Period  
Patients who discontinue study drug or do not enroll in the separate ALN-AGT01 OLE study 
will be asked to complete Safety Follow -up visits once every [ADDRESS_164808] dose of 
study drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mea n baseline level (if 
known) or until [ADDRESS_164809] dose of study drug, whichever comes earlier. During 
the Safety Follow-up period, patients should return to their pre- study medical care (usual care).  
Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will also be asked to complete the remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration) 
through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, end of treatment 
(EOT)/early termination (ET) assessments should be performed. 
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 375 patients (75 patients per group). 
The duration of treatment with ALN -AGT01 is up to [ADDRESS_164810] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  29 Patients will discontinue prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) for 2 to 4 weeks prior to 
study drug administration. During the study, blood pressure will be monitored with both 
outpatient 24-hour ABPM and automated office blood pressure measurements (EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in 
the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016). The primary endpoint will be assessed by [CONTACT_144743]. In addition, 24-hour ABPM can assess short -term blood pressure variability and circadian patterns (including potential restoration 
of the normal nocturnal blood pressure dippi[INVESTIGATOR_144650] 21% to 35% of hypertensive patients). [de la Sierra 2009 ; White 1998] More frequent measurements will be collected through 
a third method, oscillometric HBPM, to assess long-term blood pressure variability and provide close safety monitoring for potential hypotension (or hypertension) while not in the clinic. 
As recommended by [CONTACT_144688] (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH] Principles for Clinical Evaluation of 
New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000 and EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016), the first [ADDRESS_164811] ethical standards for the treatment of pati ents with hypertension, individual 
modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator judgement to maintain blood 
pressure within target is permitted starting at Month 3 and will continue throughout the study 
(except between Month 5 and Month 6 as described in Section 3.1). Separate from these treat -to-
target modifications, any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg or 
DBP ≥120 mmHg) will be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
If a patient requires treatment with a conventional oral antihypertensive before Month 6, a CCB and/or thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic may be added because there is extensive experience 
combining these classes with antihypertensive drugs that impact the RAAS. Additionally, their blood pressure effects are expected to washout within [ADDRESS_164812]-AGT01 at Month 6 (trough for the 
once every 6 month regimens) relative to placebo is critical to evaluate the feasibility of once 
every 6 month dosing regimens for future study in Phase 3. Accordingly, oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be temporarily held from Month 5 to the Month 6 ABPM assessment. For each 
patient, this limited interruption in oral antihypertensives will be contingent upon the patient’s 
Month 5 office SBP being adequately controlled (see Table 4 ) and the Investigator’s assessment 
that interruption can be safely performed and carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144689]. Of 
note, a withdrawal period is a standard element in studies of oral antihypertensives that is often 
used to establish assay sensitivity, to demonstrate maintenance of efficacy, and to assess possible withdrawal effects (ICH E12A; Principles for Clinical Evaluation of New Antihypertensive 
Drugs, 2000). Outside of research studies, antihypertensives are temporarily discontinued in 
clinical practice for diagnostic purposes, and interruptions up to [ADDRESS_164813] been shown to be safe.[Beeftink 2017] In this study, the period of interruption is limited to [ADDRESS_164814] -AGT01. If a clinically 
significant blood pressure elevation (confirmed SBP >170 mmHg; or SBP >160 mmHg accom panied by [CONTACT_23805]) occurs after the interruption of oral antihypertensives, Investigators 
will instruct the patient to promptly resume dosing with their existing supply of oral medication.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164815] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  30 After Month 6, other oral antihypertensives may be used at the discretion of the Investigator, 
following current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Because ALN -AGT01 acts on 
the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin II-receptor blocker [ARB], 
angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue agents for 
high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study. Blood pressure and pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/PD assessments will be collected through Month [ADDRESS_164816] -AGT01 for the liver is hypothesized to improve tolerability 
relative to current oral antihypertensives, [Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] the protocol’s monitoring 
plan is designed to meet the standards set by [CONTACT_144690],[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] with improvements to include the use of the newer 
oral potassium binder patiromer (or with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate [ZS-9]), if available, for treatment of potential hyperkalemia. [Georgianos and Agarwal 2018; Weir 2015] The risk of 
renal safety events is further mitigated in this study by [CONTACT_144691], which exclude 
patients who are at highest risk to have events (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 
mL/min/1.73m
2, baseline serum potassium >5 mEq/L, poorly controlled diabetes, or severely 
increased albuminuria) and those who may have decreased tolerance for renal safety events 
(patients with clinically significant heart failure, valvular heart disease, or recent history of 
cardiovascular event).  
3.3. Justification for Dose  
The doses of ALN-AGT01 in this study were selected on the basis of data from the Phase [ADDRESS_164817] an acceptable 
safety profile, and clinically significant placebo- corrected reductions in mea n SBP >10 mmHg 
by 24-hour ABPM were observed after doses as low as 100 mg. Dose selection was guided by 
[CONTACT_144692] a range of PD 
effects (ie, lowering of serum AGT) and antihypertensive responses. This is expected to enable development of population average dose-response relationships for PD and efficacy to guide identification of optimal treatment regimens (dose and dose frequency) for Phase 3.  
Preliminary PK/PD modeling based on serum AGT data from Study [ADDRESS_164818]-AGT01 results in a dose-dependent lowering of serum AGT, with maximum reductions 
predicted to be achieved as early as 1 month postdose and significant reductions sustained for 
close to 6 months after dosing. Modeling of the relationship between serum AGT lowering and blood pressure suggests a log- linear relationship, with ≥92% reduction in serum AGT predicted 
to achieve median SBP reduction of ≥10 mmHg.  
Based on these, the once every 6 month doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg were selected to result in 
median serum AGT reductions of 81.9%, 89.4%, and 94.9%, respectively, at trough (Month 6), 
translating to median SBP reductions of 6.[ADDRESS_164819] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)

3.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
Using the Interactive Response Technology (IRT), patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_164821] 6 months of the 12-month DB period: 
• Placebo SC once every 3 months 
• [ADDRESS_164822]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_164823]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_164824]-AGT01 SC once every 3 months 
• [ADDRESS_164825]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
Patients initially randomized to placebo will be re -randomized 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_164826] -AGT01 regimens. 
Patients who enter the DB Extension period will continue their current blinded dosing regimen from the DB period. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] 
(mean 24 -hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg). 
Each patient will be uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and patient identification number. Upon signing the informed consent form (ICF), the patient will be 
assigned a patient identification number by [CONTACT_82550]. The Investigator or his/her designee 
will randomize the patient in IRT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. The Investigator or his/her designee will re-randomize the 
patient in IRT at Month [ADDRESS_164827]-AGT01 dose 
groups. 
3.5. Blinding  
The Sponsor, all site personnel (except for the site pharmacist or delegate), and patients will be 
blinded to study drug treatment through Month [ADDRESS_164828] patient’s Month 6 visit, a limited amount (ie, one -third) of SBP data will be made 
available to this small, independent pharmacometrics team for preliminary PK/PD modeling. 
After the database lock to support the analysis of Month 6 data is complete, all other Sponsor 
personnel will be unblinded to treatment assignment, but the site personnel (except for the site pharmacist) and patients will remain blinded to treatment assignment until after the analysis of

Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_164830] patient completes the assessments at the Month 12 visit.  
Blinded doses of study drug will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator (see 
Section  5.2.2). All patients will receive the same volume and number of injections regardless of 
treatment assignment (patients receiving once every [ADDRESS_164831]-AGT01 to maintain the blind). Because ALN -AGT01 may be slightly visually distinguishable from placebo, all blinded study 
drug doses will be prepared and the syringe(s) will be masked by a site pharmacist or delegate 
prior to administration by a blinded healthcare professiona l. See the Pharmacy Manual for 
additional details.  
3.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
If the treating physician determines that the clinical management of the patient requires knowledge of the study drug assignment, the Investigator may break the blind, as necessary, in 
IRT. If time permits, clinical study center personnel should contact [CONTACT_3433] e Medical Monitor before 
unblinding to discuss the need to unblind the patient but must do so within [ADDRESS_164832] reached the end of the study if the patient:

4.3. Removal from Study Drug or Assessment  
Patients are free to discontinue study drug and/or stop protocol procedural assessments, or 
participation in the study as a whole at any time and for any reason, without penalty to their 
continuing medical care. The Investigator or the Sponsor may discontinue study drug or stop a patient’s participation in the study at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best 
interest. Any discontinuation of treatment or the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144652]’s participation in the 
study must be fully documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and should be followed up by [CONTACT_737]. 
Discontinuation of study drug or declining procedural assessments is described in Section 4.3.1, 
while the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a patient’s participation in the study is detailed in Section  4.3.2. 
4.3.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug or Declining Procedural Assessments  
Reasons for discontinuation of study drug include any of the following: 
• Significant protocol deviation; which includes required treatment with prohibited medication (as defined in Section  5.5.2) per Investigator discretion 
• AE 
• Non-adherence to treatment regimen  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Other reason (non- AE) 
• Or, study is terminated by [CONTACT_144745], the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor or Medical Monitor before discontinuing dosing in the patient. Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study drug dosing immediately (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for reporting and follow-up of pregnancy). A 
positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to 
discontinuing the study drug. 
Patients who discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments should not be 
automatically removed from study. In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for 
any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments and study visits so that their experience is captured in the final analyses.  
If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1), including different options for follow-up and collection 
of data (eg, in person, by [CONTACT_648], by [CONTACT_2319], through family or friends, or from options not involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians or from review

patient’s medical records.  
If a patient discontinues dosing due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason 
must be recorded in the eCRF. Patients who discontinue study drug and remain on study may receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator judge ment, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue from study drug before Month 6 will be encouraged to remain on the study and complete assessments (except study drug administration) through Month 6. They will also be asked to complete Safety Follow-up visits once every [ADDRESS_164845] dose of 
study drug per the safety follow- up schedule (see Table 1) until PD recovery or [ADDRESS_164846] dose of study drug (whichever is earlier); see Section 3.1. 
Patients who discontinue study drug after the Month 6 visit will be asked to return for their next 
scheduled visit to complete EOT/ET assessments and complete Safety Follow -up visits once 
every [ADDRESS_164847] dose of study drug per the safety follow-up schedule (see Table 1 ) 
until PD recovery or [ADDRESS_164848] dose of study drug (whichever is earlier); see 
Section  3.1. 
4.3.2. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient Stops Participation in the Study  
A patient may stop participation in the study at any time. A patient considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144653] 6 should be informed that the patient can discontinue 
study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study to complete their study 
assessments through the Month [ADDRESS_164849] the Month 6 visit assessments at an earlier time ( Table 1).  
A patient considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144654] 6 visit should be informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study to complete the assessments scheduled for the EOT /ET visit and complete 
Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section 4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal assessments for which the patient consents.  
If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator 
is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144655]. Data 
collected from the patient can continue to be used. 
Note, in countries where the collection and processing of the patient’s personal data is based on 
consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process his/her personal data (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), as applicable, personal data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as 
appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases ) can be included 
after withdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by [CONTACT_1769].

use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the study doctor at any 
time in writing or in any other form that may be locally require d. Also, where allowed by [CONTACT_49762], the patient may object to the collection, storage, and use of his/her personal data, informing 
the study doctor at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required. In both 
cases, the Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information (including any data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samples until the time of 
withdrawal/objection) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as 
applicable,  further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study  
The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this 
is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. However, study integrity and interpretation are 
best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study  assessments and follow-up even if study 
drug is discontinued. 
Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section 8.1.6. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Reason for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation 
The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts will be made to complete and report the 
observations as thoroughly as possible. If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, 
including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section 6.5.6. 
4.3.3. Lost to Follow- Up 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_144746]. The following actions 
must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a r equired study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_144695], and/or should 
continue in the study. 
• Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or loc al 
equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s medical record.  
• Should the patient continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164851] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  39 • For patients who are lost to follow-up, the Investigator can search publicly available 
records (where permitted and allowed by [CONTACT_1769]) to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible.

(including but not limited to unusual clumsiness, gait abnormalities, and unexplained 
balance/coordination issues that are either absent at or worsening from the baseline) should be 
reported as an AE. If the treatment -emergent AE is persistent and considered related to study 
drug, specialty consultation with a neurologist should be considered. However, if such a 
treatment -emergent AE is serious or severe (regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of 
relatedness), the patient must be referred for neurologist consultation, and study drug dosing 
must be held until that consultation is complete. Resumption of dosing must be approved by [CONTACT_1689].

described in the Pharmacy Manual. 
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
Instructions specific to unused study drug and additional storage will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
5.2.7. Packaging and Labeling 
All packaging, labeling, and production of study drug will be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice specifications, as well as applicable local regulations. Study drug labels 
and external packaging will include all appropriate information as per local labeling 
requirements. Additional details will be available in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.2.8. Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of 
ALN-AGT01 supplied for this study, including dates of receipt. In addition, accurate records will 
be kept of when and how much ALN-AGT01 is dispensed and administered to each patient in the study. Any reasons for departure from the protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded.  
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all ALN -AGT01. Used, 
partially used, and unused ALN-AGT01 will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations. 
Further instructions about drug accountability will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.3. Clinical Product Complaints  
5.3.1. Definition  
A clinical product complaint (CPC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or 
performance of the study drug and its packaging after it is released for distribution to the site at which study drug will be administered. 
A CPC may be detected prior to use of study drug, during use, or after use. A CPC is typi[INVESTIGATOR_144657]; however, it is possible that study drug complaints could be associated with an AE. Examples of a CPC include, but are not limited to: illegible clinical label, missing clinical label, damaged vial, empty vial, and contamination of study drug.

5.4. Monitoring for Potential Clinical Events  
5.4.1. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hypotension 
Hypotension is an obligate risk of antihypertensive medications. In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure should be monitored weekly with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential hypotension. Whenever possible, mana gement decisions 
will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698]. 
The following management recommendations for hypotension are provided: 
• Low blood pressure that is associated with symptoms should promptly be evaluated at 
the clinical study site or another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Clinical study site evaluation for low blood pressure should include the assessment of orthostatic blood pressure (eg, supi[INVESTIGATOR_144658]).  
• The Investigator should consider downtitration, interruption, or discontinuation of oral antihypertensives (if taking) if confirmed office SBP <90 mmHg or if clinical symptoms, such as lightheadedness or dizziness, develop coupled with a significantly lowe r SBP compared to prior visits (ie, SBP <100 mmHg). 
• Clinically significant events discovered during the course of a patient’s general medical care should be promptly communicated to the site and evaluated by [CONTACT_737], especially if hypotension is noted. Patients will carry Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) -approved patient cards to facilitate this physician- to-physician 
communication.  
• If hypotension is confirmed, serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured and any oral antihypertensive(s) previously started for hypertensive escape should be down-titrated, interrupted, or discontinued per Investigator judgement.  
• The frequency of blood pressure and biochemical monitoring (serum electrolytes and creatinine) should be increased during intercurrent illnesses that predispose patients to 
dehydration (eg, vomiting or diarrhea that persists for more than 24 hours) or when 
symptoms consistent with decreased effective circulating volume (eg, presyncopal symptoms, unexplained falls, decreased urine output) manifest, even if a patient’s recent blood pressure measurements have been normal.  
• Hypotension that warrants direct evaluation at the site should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours. In addition, other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (eg, unexplained presyncope, syncope, or falls) should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_164866] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  44 • Management of persistent hypotension may include increased salt intake or, if 
unresponsive, standard treatments for orthostatic intolerance syndromes such as fludrocortisone or midodrine. 
• Low blood pressure that requires medical treatment (including intravenous fluid 
support) or other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (see above) 
should be recorded as AEs. 
5.4.2. Monitoring and Approach for Clinically Significant Blood Pressure Elevation 
In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored 
frequently with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential significant elevations. Whenever 
possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698]. The recommended interventions for potentially clinically significant blood pressure elevation are presented in Table 4.  
Table 4: Recommended Interventions for Potentially Clinically Significant Blood 
Pressure Elevation  
Study Period  Intervention  
Throughout Study • Whenever possible, management decisions should be based on blood 
pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698].  
• Any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg 
and/or office DBP ≥120 mmHg) should be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
• Because ALN -AGT01 acts on the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS 
inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue agents for high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study.  
• If added, oral antihypertensives must be used per their labeled instructions 
and in accordance with current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 
2018] 
Day 1 to Month 3 Intervene if clinically significant blood pressure elevation: 
• Because of the gradual onset of effects of ALN-AGT01, interventions for 
asymptomatic hypertension should be avoided in the first 6 weeks after the 
patient’s first administration of study drug.  
• After Week 6, patients who develop office SBP >160 mmHg and increased 
>10 mmHg from their baseline office SBP that persists for ≥24 hours on 2 consecutive measurements or that is accompanied by [CONTACT_144699]. Severely 
symptomatic patients should be evaluated at the clinical study site or 
another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144659] 24 hours. 
• If persistent hypertension is confirmed (without the identification of a 
specific treatable cause) and the Investigator deems it to be a clinically significant change, treatment may be initiated at the medical discretion of 
the Investigator using a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic. 
Investigators should avoid long-acting agents that may not fully washout between Month [ADDRESS_164867] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  45 Study Period  Intervention  
Months 3 to 6 Treat to target blood pressure using a CCB and/or thiazide/thiazide- like diure tic: 
• At Month 3, a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic may be added if 
the daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by [CONTACT_44117]. If the Investigator feels 
there is a compelling clinical reason to wait, the rationale for exception should be documented in the eCRF. 
• After Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per 
Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above recommended target per treatment guidelines (eg, office SBP <140 mmHg, HBPM SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP by [CONTACT_44117] <135 
mmHg). [Williams 2018] 
• A temporary hold of oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be performed in 
appropriate patients (below) from Month 5 to Month 6: 
­ Month 5 office S
BP <160 mmHg if taking no oral antihypertensive 
agents 
­ Month 5 office S
BP <155 mmHg if taking 1 oral antihypertensive agent 
­ Month 5 office S
BP <150 mmHg if taking 2 oral antihypertensive 
agents.  
• During this 
4-week period, blood pressure will be carefully monitored by 
[CONTACT_144747] >170  mmHg (or if confirmed office SBP >160 mmHg accompanied by 
[CONTACT_23805])  
Month 6 to End of 
Study Treat to target blood pressure using Investigator’s choice of oral 
antihypertensive(s ). 
• At Month 6, prior oral antihypertensive may be restarted per Investigator judgement if daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by [CONTACT_44117].  
• Oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per Investigator 
judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above recommended 
target per treatment guidelines (eg, office SBP <140 mmHg; HBPM SBP 
<135 mmHg; daytime mean SBP by [CONTACT_44117] <135 mmHg). [Whelton 2018 ; 
Williams 2018 ] 
5.4.3. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Renal Dysfunction 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of eGFR 
through the anticipated onset of initial ALN-AGT01 PD. Based upon the renal dysfunction 
associated with conventional RAAS inhibitors,[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] the following 
guidelines apply throughout the study: 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥30% from baseline or to ≤30 mL/min/1.73m
2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, contact 
[CONTACT_1034], and look for potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction such as: 
− NSAIDs, antibiotics, or other treatments known to impair renal function 
− Recent exposure to intravenous contrast agents 
− Hypotension

≤25 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, look for 
potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction, and contact [CONTACT_144748]. Serum creatinine should be monitored at least weekly until improving.  
• If a patient is on additional oral antihypertensive agents, the Investigator should consider whether these agents should be interrupted, especially during intercurrent illness or volume depletion 
5.4.4. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hyperkalemia

Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_164873] not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated. For permitted concomitant 
medications administered SC, do not administer in same injectio n site area as the study drug for 
[ADDRESS_164874] dose of study drug. 
Patients receiving low -dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (defined as ≤100 mg per day) for at least [ADDRESS_164875] 2 days prior to ABPM and office 
blood pressure measurements, and alternative analgesics (acetaminophen, topi[INVESTIGATOR_35791]) 
should be considered.[ Whelton 2018] When used, the dosing of systemic NSAIDs should be at 
the lower end of the labeled range and for the shortest duration possible.  
Patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) should 
be on a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to screening and during the study treatment period. These medications should not be initiated or discontinued, if possible, during the study treatment period.  
Patients will be allowed to receive vaccines (eg, for SARS -CoV- 2) that have received health 
agency authorization (including for emergency use) by [CONTACT_144703]. Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by [CONTACT_3786], except as described in Section 5.5.2. However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded on the eCRF. 
Concomitant medication will be coded using an internationally recognized and accepted coding 
dictionary. 
5.5.1. Oral Antihypertensive Medication  
Individual initiation and modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator 
judgement are permitted throughout the study if required to treat clinically significant blood 
pressure elevation (Section  5.4.2). In addition, after a patient completes the placebo-controlled 
primary endpoint at Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per 
Investigator judgment for persistent elevations in blood pressure above recommended target per 
treatment g uidelines (eg, office SBP <140 mmHg, HBPM SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean 
SBP by [CONTACT_44117] <135 mmHg). [Williams 2018 ] All oral antihypertensive medication that are 
dosed once daily should be taken in the morning. 
Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured at a central or local laboratory 
approximately 2 weeks after any antihypertensive addition or dose titration. 
5.5.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medication  
The following medications, treatments, and supplements are prohibited throughout the study 
treatment period (until the EOT visit): 
• Conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors)  
• Prescription NSAIDs  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164876] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  49 • Organic nitrate preparations (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide 
dinitrate, pentaerythritol)  
• An RNAi therapeutic (other than ALN- AGT01)  
• Medications, herbal supplements (including Ma Huang and St. John’s wort), or other substances (such as licorice) that are associated with increases in LFT abnormalities or with blood pressure abnormalities are prohibited. This includes certain stimulants 
(eg, amphetamine, methylphenidate dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine), MAO 
inhibitors, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709] (eg, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), diet pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (eg, phenylpropanolamine, sibutramine), and nasal decongestants (eg, phenylephrine 
hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine, naphazoline hydrochloride), unless individually 
approved by [CONTACT_144704]. 
• Medications, herbal medicines, over- the-counter medications, or supplements known 
to cause hyperkalemia are prohibited unless individually approved by [CONTACT_144749]. This includes potassium-sparing diuretics, 
potassium supplements, cyclo-oxygenase-[ADDRESS_164877] dose, throughout study participation, and through safety follow- up (if applicable; see Section  3.1).  
Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include: 
• Placement of an intrauterine device.  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient). 
• Established use of oral (except low-dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164878] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  50 • True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent 
patients must agree to use one of the above-mentioned contraceptive methods if they 
start heterosexual relationships during the study and through safety follow- up (if 
applicable; Section  3.1).  
Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. 
Females of child -bearing potential include female patients who have experienced menarche (or 
begin menarche over the course of the study), and who are not postmenopausal or permanently 
sterilized (eg, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]). A postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause, confirmed by [CONTACT_144705].  
For male patients, no contraception is required. However, use by [CONTACT_144706] 
(condom) may be required in some countries, eg, [LOCATION_009], in order to comply with local 
requirements as described in the corresponding patient ICFs.  
Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144707] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Pregnancy testing will be 
performed before every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of the study (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.2. Alcohol Restrictions  
Patients should limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 units per day (unit: 1 glass of wine [approximately 125 mL] =1 measure of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_2120] [approximately 1 fluid ounce] =½ pi[INVESTIGATOR_43924] [approximately 284 mL]) for the duration 
of the study. Compliance with alcohol restrictions should be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144708]. 
5.7.3. Tobacco and Nicotine Restrictions  
Use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing 
tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e-cigarettes) must be avoided within [ADDRESS_164879] 1 week prior to screening 
assessments of blood pressure. Of note, this is the sodium intake recommended in the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension Guidelines for both hypertensive patients and for the general population.[ Williams 2018 ]  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164880] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_164881] for ≥10 hours before sample collection (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.5. Exercise  
Patients should abstain from strenuous exercise for [ADDRESS_164882] es and measurement of vital 
signs (including blood pressure assessments) and weight (at the discretion of the Investigator). See further details in Section  10.2. 
6.1. Screening Assessments  
An ICF that has been approved by [CONTACT_144709] (IRB)/IEC must be signed (in paper or electronic format per local regulations and institutional standards) by [CONTACT_144750]. All patients will be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF. 
Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria. Rescreening of patients is permitted with consultation of the Medical Monitor (see Section  6.1.2).  
Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained. Any changes to medical history occurring between the screening assessment and Day 1 will be updated prior to study drug administration. 
6.1.1. Retesting  
If in the Investigator’s judgement, the screening laboratory abnormalities are likely to be 
transient, then laboratory tests may be repeated. The Investigator’s rationale should be 
documented. Laboratory values can be retested once during screening provide d that the patient 
can be evaluated for eligibility after at least 2 to 4 weeks of washout (as applicable) and 
randomized within the allowed Screening period. Retesting of screening ABPM is permitted 
once if the first screening ABPM is invalid. A valid screening ABPM recording must be obtained 
within [ADDRESS_164883] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  52 ABPM result obtained. If a valid ABPM reading that meets the inclusion criterion is unable to be 
obtained within 2 weeks prior to randomization, the patient is a screen failure. 
6.1.2. Rescreening  
A patient who does not meet all study eligibility criteria due to a transient condition observed at 
screening (eg, prohibited medications that were subsequently discontinued) will be allowed to 
return once for rescreening. A patient will be re-consented if rescreening occurs outside of the 
60-day screening window. In this case, all screening procedures must be repeated. 
6.2. Efficacy Assessments 
All blood pressure measurements (ABPM, office, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in 
Section  10.1.  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives, a washout of at least 2 to 4 weeks (as applicable) must 
be completed prior to measurement of the baseline ABPM (for eligibility) and baseline office 
blood pressure. The baseline ABPM and office blood pressure must be measured within 2 we eks 
before randomization. An HBPM unit will be provided during the Screening period to facilitate 
monitoring during the washout of prior oral antihypertensives (if taking) and to establish the 
HBPM baseline prior to randomization. To establish baseline, [ADDRESS_164884] week immediately prior to randomization. 
ABPM placement may be performed at home by [CONTACT_144711], as detailed in 
the ABPM Investigator Manual. If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained remotely using the methods described in Section 10.1. 
Recommendations for approach and monitoring of low blood pressure/hypotension and 
hypertensive escape are provided in Section 5.4.1 and Section  5.4.2, respectively. 
6.2.1. ABPM  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as rescue medication), ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication.  
Validity will be assessed for all ABPMs. If the ABPM recording is invalid at any point during 
the study, the patient will be provided [ADDRESS_164885] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_164886] be measured using the automated blood pressure device provided by 
[CONTACT_144712] (prior to taking oral antihypertensives) and at approximately the same time 
each day; therefore, visits should be scheduled at approximately the same time of day, whenever possible. Office blood pressure must include orthostatic measurements (seated and standing).  
Exercise, caffeine, alcohol consumption, and use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products 
(including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 minutes prior to blood pressure measurements. The use 
of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood 
pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) sho uld be avoided within [ADDRESS_164887]/caffeine or taking morning oral medications. HBPM is not required on days when ABPM is being assessed. The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet flat on the floor as detailed in Section  10.[ADDRESS_164888] sites will be given the option of using a wearable blood pressure sensor for 2 periods of 2 to 4 weeks each according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). 
Wearable blood pressure assessments performed during screening should be obtained during the last [ADDRESS_164889] as described in the Biobeat 
Investigator Manual, using the opposite arm as that used for ABPM. 
6.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples for determination of AGT and RAAS biomarkers (plasma renin concentration, 
AngI, AngII, and aldosterone) will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1). Blood samples collected for AngI and AngII require special processing and will be 
assessed at sites that have appropriate resources, equipment, and reagents. Blood samples for PD 
assessments must be collected before study drug administration (on days when study drug is to 
be dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing (on other days). Blood AGT levels will be analyzed at a central laboratory by [CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent 
assay for measurement of PD effect. These biomarkers m ay be analyzed using qualified assays. 
Details regarding the collection, processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and storage of the samples will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Results will not be used to adjust dosing of ALN-AGT01 or guide clinical management and will 
not be shared with sites until after the last patient completes Month 12. If clinical circumstances

Plasma concentrations of ALN -AGT01 and AS(N- 1)3′ ALN -AGT01 will be determined using a 
validated assay. Details regarding sample volumes to be collected, and the processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the study will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs, including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and laboratory tests. Clinically significant abnormalities 
observed during the physical examination are recorded. 
6.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) and include 
office blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. When vital signs and 
blood sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs should be performed before blood samples are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be measured predose in the seated 
position, after the patient has rested comfortably for approximately 5 minutes. Body temperature 
in degrees Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, forehead, or axillary methods. Heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_144662] a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. Blood pressure is described in 
Section  6.2.  
Additional vital sign assessments, as medially indicated, may be added at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
Vital signs results will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5.2. Weight, Height, and Morphometrics 
Height and body weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded in the eCRF. Height will be measured at screening 
only. Height will be measured in centimeters. Body weight should be measured in kilograms to 
the first decimal point in patients wearing light clothing and without shoes.  
Waist circumference and waist -to-hip- ratio will also be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded on the eCRF. For waist circumference and waist -to-
hip ratio, patients should wear minimal clothing to ensure that the measuring tape is correctly 
positioned. Patients should stand erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, fe et together 
and with their weight equally divided over both legs. To perform the waist measurement, the 
lowest rib margin is first located and marked with a pen. The iliac crest is then palpated in the

Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_164893] centimeter and entered in the source document. Each 
measurement should be repeated twice; if the measurements are within 1 cm of each other, the average should be calculated. If the difference between the 2 measurements exceeds 1 cm, the 2 measurements should be repeated.  
6.5.3. Physical Examination 
Full and symptom-directed physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ); if a physical examination is scheduled for a dosing visit, it should be 
conducted prior to dosing. Full physical examinations will include the examination of the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascul ar, 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and 
neurological status (see the Recommended Neurological Assessments for All Physical 
Examinations document for further details on the assessments to be performed as part of the neurological evaluation). 
Symptom-directed physical examinations will be guided by [CONTACT_144714], 
or the onset of new symptoms, since the last visit. Neurological evaluation should be performed during all symptom- directed physical examinations regardless of whet her neurological 
symptoms have been experienced by [CONTACT_102].  
Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on 
the medical history or AE eCRF. 
6.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead ECGs reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, 
and QT interval and Fridericia- corrected QT interval will be obtained using a local machine, as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients should be supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_164894] changed since the Baseline visit and to 
determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be recorded in the eCRF.   
When ECG and blood sample collection for RAAS biomarkers (renin, aldosterone, and Ang I/II) occur at the same visit, and where feasible, blood sample collection should occur first. ECGs should be performed at least [ADDRESS_164895] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_164896] 
changed since the baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These 
assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
6.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory. Specific 
instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. For any other unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug 
administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, 
or as per DMC advice, until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately explain the abnormality. Additional safety laboratories and assessments as 
indicated by [CONTACT_144715]. Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in 
Table 6 and will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).  
While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical decisions, on the day of the 
assessments all laboratory assessments specified in Table 6 which are performed at the clinic 
should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory. In the case of discrepant local and central laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day, central laboratory results will be relied upon for clinical decisions. 
Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical study center or at home by a 
trained healthcare professional. Blood samples collected for RAAS biomarkers should be 
collected in the morning and in the seated/upright position (after blood pr essure measurements 
and before any assessments collected in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]). 
Spot urine collections for albumin and creatinine should be obtained in the morning.  
For any safety event or laboratory abnormality, additional laboratory assessments, imaging, and 
consultation may be performed for clinical evaluation and/or in consultation with the Medical Monitor; results may be collected and should be included in the cl inical database.

Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  58 [IP_ADDRESS]. Fasting Lipid Panel and Glycemic Assessments  
Blood samples for fasting plasma glucose, insulin, lipid panel (including total cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein [HDL-C], non- HDL -C, low-density lipoprotein, apolipoprotein A1, and 
triglycerides), and HbA1c will be collected at the time points listed in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). Patients are required to fast for ≥10 hours before sample collection for 
fasting plasma glucose, insulin, lipid panel, and HbA1c. Samples should be collected at approximately the same time of day (±2 hours). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunogenicity  
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate anti -drug antibodies (ADA). Blood samples for ADA 
testing must be collected before study drug administration (on days when study drug is to be 
dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing (on other days) as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). A blood sample to evaluate ADA will be 
collected at the ET visit, if applicable. Blood samples for ADA will be analyzed at a central laboratory. 
Details regarding the processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and analysis of the samples will be provided in the 
Laboratory Manual. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Testing  
A pregnancy test will be performed for females of child -bearing potential. A serum pregnancy 
test will be performed at screening, and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per 
the Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is suspected. More frequent pregnancy 
testing may be performed where required per local requirements. The results of the pregnancy test must be known before study drug administration. Patients who are pregnant at screening are 
not eligible for study participation. Any woman with a positive urine pregnancy test, 
subsequently confirmed by a positive serum pregnancy test, during the study will be discontinued from study drug but will continue to be followed for safety. Patients determined to 
be pregnant while on study will be followed at least until the pregnancy outcome is known (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for follow -up instructions). 
A blood sample will be drawn at screening to measure the levels of follicle stimulating hormone 
in order to confirm postmenopausal status in all women suspected to be postmenopausal (see

6.5.6. Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and [ADDRESS_164900] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164901] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  60 • Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144663] (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse). 
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest: 
• ALT or AST >3×ULN  
• Severe or serious ISRs; ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or those that lead to temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of ALN-AGT01. 
An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection. “At or near” the 
injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as 
may occur with swelling or hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the 
injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not considered an ISR. 
For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section  [IP_ADDRESS], respectively.  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
Moderate:  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money). 
Severe:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding 
self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden); OR life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; OR death related to an adverse event. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164902] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_164903] to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity. Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Adverse event severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the 
intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE).  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Drug  
The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by [CONTACT_144716] a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]?” A “yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to the study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in the patient’s health since the 
last visit. The patient should also be asked if the patient has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, 
used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and over-the-counter). In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any 
clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other 
findings that are relevant to patient saf ety. 
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by [CONTACT_144717]. Non- serious AEs will be  followed until the end of study. 
Events occurring after signing of the ICF and before study drug administration will be captured as medical history (see Section  6.1), while AEs that occur after study drug administration, and 
baseline events that worsen after study drug administration, must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by [CONTACT_144718]. SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by [CONTACT_144719],  as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug- related. Each AE must be described in 
detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken, 
and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) in the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164904] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_164905] (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the supplemental AEs of 
Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed. Additional clinical and laboratory information may 
be collected. Refer to CRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF.  
For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or Symptoms eCRF, recording additional information regarding each injection site reaction that is entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom(s), injection site location, follow-up actions taken, etc). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the Sponsor or its designee 
should be notified within 24 hours using the appropriate eCRF. [IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737]. Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee immediately and no later than [ADDRESS_164906] the following information: 
• Patient’s study number 
• Description and date of onset of the event 
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug, and 
• Investigator/site information  
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. Immediately and no 
later than [ADDRESS_164907] update the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form.  
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by [CONTACT_144720]/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE. These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should be recorded. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by [CONTACT_144721]. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by [CONTACT_144722].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164908] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  63 [IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the IRB/IEC per their 
institutional policy by [CONTACT_9304] (or Sponsor designee) according to country 
requirements. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_16211]/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through safety follow-up (Section 3.1), the 
Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_164909] dose of study drug. 
The pregnancy should be followed by [CONTACT_144723]. At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE 
as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overdose and Other Special Situations Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose of study drug administered to the participant or taken by [CONTACT_144724] >2× the assigned dose during a single administration and/or ≥2 doses within ½ 
the intended dosing interval. 
The Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  
In an event of an overdose or other special situations (eg, medication error, abuse, misuse, CPC 
associated with an AE), the Investigator should: 
• Contact [CONTACT_27909] 24 hours  
• Submit the special situations reporting form within [ADDRESS_164910] information in the Pharmacy Manual 
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities 
• Document the amount of study drug given  
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication will be considered AEs/SAEs.  
Full details of overdose and other special situations reporting instructions will be outlined in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and Biospecimen Repository  
Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144664]. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164911] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_164912]. More generally, genetic variations may account for the 
well-described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with hypertension, as well as 
their responses to treatment.  
Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and patient consent, samples will be collected as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the 
application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may further eluc idate the outcomes of this 
study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or efficacy of ALN -AGT01. 
Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1). These specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory. Potential exploratory 
investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progression, efficacy, or safety. 
The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety 
laboratory samples, PK samples, etc) that are obtained during the study. 
These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following 
the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations. After [ADDRESS_164913] elapsed, samples will be destroyed. 
Details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_144665]. 
Exploratory analysis of these biospecimens will be performed by [CONTACT_144725].  
When biobanking is permitted by [CONTACT_1295], study participants will be advised during the 
informed consent process of these biobanking details and the potential for exploratory 
investigation of their samples.  
7. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock and unblinding for the 
primary analysis. The plan will detail the implementation of the statistical analyses in accordance 
with the principle features stated in the protocol. 
7.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_164914]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg, and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sample size of 375 patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response signal in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2- sided significance level of 
0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_164915] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)

Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  74 10. APPENDICES  
10.1. Measurement of Blood Pressure  
All blood pressure measurements (office, ABPM, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in the relevant user manuals.  
The appropriately sized cuff for each modality must be used for all assessments. The arm’s 
circumference at midpoint (halfway between the acromion and olecranon) should be determined 
at screening with a metric tape measure and used to select the appropriat ely sized blood pressure 
cuff/bladder for each instrument as described in the ABPM Investigator Manual and the HBPM 
and OBPM Investigator Manual. Unless significant weight loss or gain occurs between visits, the patient should use the same cuff/bladder size throughout the study. 
At the first Screening visit only, office blood pressure will be measured in both arms to select the 
appropriate arm to use for office blood pressure and HBPM measurements. Unless a concomitant 
condition favors the use of a specific arm, the arm with the higher office SBP should be used for 
all subsequent office blood pressure and HBPM readings. The ABPM should be measured using the patient’s nondominant arm. If the patient is ambidextrous, the same arm used for office blood pressure and HBPM readings should be used. 
ABPM  
The appropriately sized cuff should be placed on the correct arm following the instructions in the 
ABPM Investigator Manual. In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as 
rescue medication), ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication. All ABPM collections must be in the outpatient/ambulatory state. During screening, 
ABPM recording must be obtained within [ADDRESS_164935] be obtained in advance of the visit (within 
7 days before the corresponding dosing visit) and the results reviewed prior to dosing. 
During the 24-hour monitoring period, patients must avoid strenuous exercise but should 
otherwise maintain their usual level of physical activity. The ABPM is programmed to take readings every 20 minutes during the day (6 am to 9:59 pm) and every 30 minutes during the 
night (10 pm to 5:59 am). While awake, the patient should hold their arm still by [CONTACT_144736] a reading. Patients must record the timing of going to sleep, waking up, and any oral medications taken during the ABPM, and these responses must be entered into the eCRF.  
After the monitoring period is complete, upload the ABPM data to receive a report with validity assessment. An ABPM will be considered valid if (1) the number of successful daytime readings 
is ≥33, (2) the number of successful nighttime readings is ≥11, and (3) no more than 3 hours are 
not represented (ie, 3 sections of 60 minutes where 0 valid readings were obtained). If the ABPM recording is invalid at any point during the study, the patient will be provided [ADDRESS_164936] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_164937] be measured using the automated blood pressure device provided by 
[CONTACT_144737]. 
Office blood pressure should be measured early in the visit prior to the morning dose of 
antihypertensive medication, before phlebotomy or other potentially stressful assessments. To 
minimize confounding by [CONTACT_144738], study visits should be scheduled for a consistent timeframe of the day. The use of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 
hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 
inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) should be avoided within 48 hours prior to measuring blood pressure. 
Before measuring blood pressure, confirm that there has been no exercise or use of caffeine or 
nicotine- or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e- cigarettes) with in the last [ADDRESS_164938] blood pressure measurements, ask the patient to use the bathroom before the assessment. 
All office blood pressure assessments will include both seated and standing measurements.  
Seated Office Blood Pressure Measurement:  For seat
 ed measurements, the patient should be in a 
comfortable resting position in a chair with their back supported and their feet flat on the floor. 
• Place the appropriately sized cuff on the correct arm with no clothing between the 
patient’
s arm and the cuff and with the midpoint of the bladder length positioned over 
the brachial artery (located by [CONTACT_23302]). The arm should be supported on an armrest or table with mid -cuff at heart level and the palm facing the ceiling.  
• Follow the HBPM and OBPM Investigator Manual to initiate the automated blood pressure device’s seated measurement protocol. This program includes a [ADDRESS_164939] 3 individual measurements.  
• During the device’s seated measurement protocol, the staff member should leave the room and the patient should remain at rest without distraction (avoid mobile phones). The following script may be used: “The blood pressure device works best when you 
are at  rest and without any distraction. If you agree, I would like to leave the room for 
the next [ADDRESS_164940], followed by [CONTACT_2902] 5 minutes of the device inflating to measure your blood pressure”.  
Standing Office Blood Pressure Measurement: A standing measurement should be obtained 
immediately after collection of the seated measurements.  
• Being careful to maintain the cuff’s position, ask the patient to stand with the cuffed arm bent s
lightly and the hand of the cuffed arm supported at heart level.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164941] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 5, 04  November 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  76 • Using a stopwatch or watch, measure standing blood pressure 1 minute after standing 
by [CONTACT_144739]’s single measurement protocol.  
• After the standing measurement, ask the patient if they experienced dizziness or light-headedness when standing and enter their response in the eCRF. 
If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained remotely by a visiting nurse or other appropriately trained personnel who will bring an office blood pressure instrument to the 
patient’s location and follow the same procedure performed at the site. If a home visit is not 
possible, a “remote visit blood pressure measurement” should instead be obtained using the patient’s HBPM instrument under direct supervision (phone call or teleconferencing) by 
[CONTACT_144740], following the instructions detailed in the HBPM and OBPM 
Investigator Manual. Results and the remote method used should be entered into the eCRF. 
HBPM  
Patients should measure HBPM in the morning, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning 
oral medications. HBPM is not required on days when ABPM is being assessed. The HBPM measurement should be obtained in a room without distractions, seated comfortably with the 
back supported and feet flat on the floor. The patient will initiate the automated blood pressure 
program on their HBPM device. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by [ADDRESS_164942] 3 individual measurements.  
To establish baseline, each patient should measure HBPM during the week (with at least 3 
successful readings) immediately prior to randomization. 
After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at least once per week. Patients may select the day of 
the week that is most convenient for their personal schedule. The frequency of HBPM may be increased in some patients, per Investigator discretion, if more frequent measurement is 
warranted (eg, during screening if patients are undergoing washout and during the temporary 
hold of oral antihypertensives performed from Month 5 to Month 6). 
10.2. Procedures for Optional Home Healthcare Visits  
Home healthcare may be allowed where applicable country and local regulations and 
infrastructure for home healthcare allow and will follow procedures that are in compliance with 
relevant local regulations and guidelines (eg, General Data Protection Regulation [EU (European Union) no 2016/679], ICH E6[R2], and the Declaration of Helsinki). The use of home healthcare 
is optional and will not be utilized for visits at which study drug is administered or at visits that 
are required to be performed at the site (see Table  1).  
The option for home healthcare aims to improve patient diversity, participation, engagement, and 
retention in the study by [CONTACT_144741]- related travel to the site, 
allowing flexibility in the study visit schedule.  
For clinical study sites where home healthcare is utilized, the Investigator will retain responsibility for oversight, patient safety, and conduct of the trial, and will be responsible for 
reviewing the qualifications of and approving each home healthcare professional, delegating responsibilities to the home healthcare professional in the site delegation log, providing

home visits as needed, and reviewing the source data files collected during the home healthcare 
visit. The home healthcare professional will be trained on the protocol and other relevant study documents and procedures and will be responsible for conducting vital sign assessments 
(including blood pressure assessments), collecting blood and urine samples, collecting weight, 
and documenting and notifying the site study team of any suspected or potential AE symptoms or changes to concomitant medications. The home healthcare professional will be responsible for providing source documentation of the visit to the study site.

Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  7 Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
This study will include adults (18 to 75 years, inclusive) with untreated hypertension or on stable 
therapy with up to [ADDRESS_164950] a daytime mean systolic blood pressure ( SBP) ≥135 mmHg and ≤[ADDRESS_164951]- AGT01 is a n SC administered N -acetylgalactosamine -conjugated small interfering RNA 
targeting liver -expressed messenger RNA for angiotensinogen (AGT). 
Patients randomized to receive ALN -AGT01 will be administered [ADDRESS_164952] -AGT01 beginning at Month 6.  
Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Placebo (sodium chloride 0.9% w/v for SC administration) will be administered once every [ADDRESS_164953] -AGT01 is up to 24 months. The estimated total time on 
study for each patient is up to 38 months, including up to 2 months of screening, followed by [CONTACT_25765] 24 months of treatment, and up to 12 months in the Follow-up period. 
Statistical Methods  
The planned enrollment for this study is 375 patients. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] (mean 24- hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg). 
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_164954]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg,  and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sample size of 
375 patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response 
signal in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2-sided significance 
level of 0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_164955]-AGT01 dose versus placebo with a 2 -sided significance 
level of 0.05.  
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows:  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by- treatment analyses based on the FAS will be according to the 
randomized treatment arm.  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug, grouped 
according to the treatment actually received.

• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose  of study drug. All by -
treatment analyses based on the PD Analysis Set will be grouped according to the 
treatment actually received.  
• All ALN- AGT01 Treated Set:  All patients who received any amount of [ADDRESS_164958]-AGT01 throughout the entire DB period (including DB extension period). 
To control the overall type I error, the primary and key secondary endpoints will be tested in 
hierarchical order.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Sponsor) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_144647]- AGT01 (zilebesiran) , a 
subcutaneously (SC) administered investigational agent comprised of a synthetic small 
interfering (siRNA) covalently linked to a triantennary N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand, 
which is designed to suppress liver production of angiotensinogen (AGT) and thereby [CONTACT_144682].  
1.1. Study Rationale  
Study ALN- AGT01 -002 (KARDIA -1) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-
ranging, multicenter Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics ( PD) of ALN -AGT01, administered SC, in patients with mild -to-moderate 
hypertension. Patients will be randomized to [ADDRESS_164974] 6 months of the 12-month Double-blind (DB) period. After the first [ADDRESS_164975]-AGT01 open- label 
extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reaches Month [ADDRESS_164976] on systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 
Month 3, as assessed by [CONTACT_46674] (ABPM). Se condary and 
exploratory objectives of the study include evaluating the efficacy of ALN-AGT01 on other measures of blood pressure response and evaluating the PD effect of ALN -AGT01, including 
reduction in circulating AGT concentration. 
The full rationale for the study and design is presented in Section  3.2. 
1.2. Background  
Hypertension affects 30% to 45% of adults and is the strongest modifiable risk factor for 
cardiovascular  disease, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction.[ Olsen 2016; Williams 2018 ] 
The worldwide disease burden is profound, with a global prevalence of over 1 billion,[ Kearney 
2005; NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017] and approximately 9 million deaths attributed to hypertension annually.[ Angell 2015] 
Currently available pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144672] a minority of 
patients, due in large part to  physician inertia and patient nonadherence to  daily oral 
medication. [Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Low adherence to oral antihypertensives is 
associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes and is prevalent at all stages of disease. [Corrao 
2011; Peacock and Krousel -Wood 2017; Schulz 2016; van der Laan 2017] Thus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_144669], current rates of control are low , and the global burden 
of death and disability- adjusted life -years attributed to elevated blood pressure remains 
high.[ Forouzanfar 2017; Muntner 2020] Development of new approaches to treat hypertension 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164977] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  24 and to overcome the limitations of current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217] a key unmet need.[ Dzau and Balatbat 
2019; McClellan 2019; Services 2020] 
The Sponsor is developi[INVESTIGATOR_144647]- AGT01, a novel synthetic RNA interference ( RNAi ) 
therapeutic, for SC administration for the treatment of hypertension. RNAi is a naturally 
occurring cellular mechanism for regulation of gene expression, mediated through the binding of 
siRNA to its complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, leading to mRNA cleavage and subsequent suppression of the synthesis and levels of the target protein. ALN- AGT01 
contains an siRNA targeting AGT  mRNA, conjugated to a GalNAc-containing liga nd to facilitate 
delivery to the liver. Based on the mechanism of RNAi, ALN-AGT01 is specifically designed to reduce the hepatic synthesis of AGT protein, the first substrate in the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sole precursor of vasoactive angiotensin peptides.[ Khanna 
2017; Romero 2015] Because hepatocytes are the predominant source of circulating AGT, 
ALN-AGT01 has been developed to reduce blood pressure by [CONTACT_144742] (AngII). 
Preliminary d ata from  Part A of the ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_164978]- AGT01 -001 (hereafter referred 
to as Study 001) in patients with hypertension have shown that  single SC doses of ALN- AGT01 
lead to dose-dependent and durable reductions in circulating AGT, accompanied by [CONTACT_144685] (DBP). Reductions in AGT for up to 
[ADDRESS_164979] adverse events (AEs) have been mild or moderate in severity, and there have been no 
severe or serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study drug. There have been no clinically significant elevations in serum creatinine or serum potassium, and no patient has required 
intervention for low blood pressure. No clinically significant alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) 
elevation s have been observed in Part A  patients who received ALN-AGT01 doses as high as 
800 mg. Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported in  a minority of patients and were all mild 
and transient events that resolved without intervention. 
This Phase [ADDRESS_164980]-AGT01 across a 
range of doses (150 to 600 mg) and dose intervals (once every 3 months and once every 6 
months) to identify optimal treatment. The  consistent and prolonged PD effect of ALN -AGT01  
is expected to achieve the unique benefit of continuous 24-hour blood pressure lowering with 
infrequent SC dosing.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ALN-AGT01 is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
Clinical data available from Study [ADDRESS_164981] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  28 may also be added per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above 
recommended target per treatment guidelines  (eg, office SBP <140 mmHg, home blood pressure 
monitoring [ HBPM ] SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP <135 mmHg  by 
[CONTACT_44117] ).[Williams 2018 ] Oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be temporarily held from Month 
5 to Month 6 in appropriate patients (Month 5 office SBP <155 mmHg if taking 1 oral 
antihypertensive agent or office SBP <150 mmHg if taking 2 agents) to assess the effect of ALN-AGT01 alone (vs placebo) at Month 6 by [CONTACT_44117]. During this 4-week period, blood 
pressure will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144686] >170 mmHg (or if confirmed office SBP >160 mmHg accompanied by [CONTACT_23805]). 
Patients may be eligible to participate in an ALN -AGT01 OLE study upon completion of the 
Month 12 predose assessments. If an individual patient reaches Month 12 prior to availability of 
the OLE study, they may continue their current blinded dosing in the DB Extension period for up 
to 12 additional months until the OLE study is open and then transition. Once the OLE study is 
open for enrollment, eligible patients may rollover into the OLE study at Months 12, 18, or 24 (whichever visit occurs first).  
In the DB Extension period, blood pressure will be closely monitored and individual modification of antihypertensive therapy will be allowed to maintain blood pressure in target range.  
Safety Follow- up Period  
Patients  who  discontinue study drug or do not enroll in the separate ALN-AGT01 OLE study 
will be asked to complete Safety Follow -up visits once every [ADDRESS_164982] dose of 
study drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline level (if 
known) or until [ADDRESS_164983] dose of study drug, whichever comes earlier.  
Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will also  be asked to complete the 
remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration) through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, end of treatment (EOT)/ early termination ( ET) assessments should be performed. 
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 375 patients  (75 patients per group). 
The duration of treatment with ALN -AGT01 is up to [ADDRESS_164984] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  29 Patients will discontinue prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) for 2 to 4 weeks prior to 
study drug administration. During the study, blood pressure will be monitored with both 
outpatient 24-hour ABPM and automated office blood pressure measurements (EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in 
the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016). The primary endpoint will be assessed by [CONTACT_144743]. In addition, 24-hour ABPM can assess short -term blood pressure variability and circadian patterns (including potential restoration 
of the normal nocturnal blood pressure dippi[INVESTIGATOR_144650] 21% to 35% of hypertensive patients). [de la Sierra 2009 ; White 1998] More frequent measurements will be collected through 
a third method, oscillometric HBPM, to assess long-term blood pressure variability and provide close safety monitoring for potential hypotension (or hypertension) while not in the clinic. 
As recommended by [CONTACT_144688] (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH] Principles for Clinical Evaluation of 
New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000 and EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016), the first [ADDRESS_164985] ethical standards for the treatment of pati ents with hypertension, individual 
modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator judgement to maintain blood 
pressure within target is permitted starting at Month 3 and will continue throughout the study 
(except between Month 5 and Month 6 as described in Section  3.1). Separate from these treat -to-
target modifications, any confirmed event of severe hypertension ( office SBP ≥180 mmHg or 
DBP ≥120 mmHg) will be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug 
administration.  
If a patient requires treatment with a conventional oral antihypertensive before Month 6, a CCB and/or thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic may  be added because there is extensive experience 
combining these classes with antihypertensive drugs that impact the RAAS. Additionally, their blood pressure effects are expected to washout within [ADDRESS_164986] -AGT01 at Month 6 (trough for the 
once every 6 month regimens) relative to placebo  is critical to evaluate the feasibility of once 
every 6 month dosing regimens for future study in Phase 3. Accordingly, oral antihypertensives 
(if taking) will be temporarily held from Month 5 to the Month 6 ABPM assessment. For each 
patient, this limited interruption in oral antihypertensives will be contingent upon the patient’s 
Month 5 office SBP being adequately co ntrolled (see Table 4 ) and the Investigator’s assessment 
that interruption can be safely performed and carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144689]. Of 
note, a withdrawal period is a standard element in studies of oral antihypertensives that is often 
used to establish assay sensitivity, to demonstrate maintenance of efficacy, and to assess possible withdrawal effects (ICH E12A; Principles for Clinical Evaluation of New Antihypertensive 
Drugs, 2000). Outside of research studies, antihypertensives are temporarily discontinued in 
clinical practice for diagnostic purposes, and interruptions up to [ADDRESS_164987] been shown to be safe.[Beeftink 2017] In this study, the period of interruption is limited to [ADDRESS_164988] -AGT01. If a clinically 
significant blood pressure elevation (confirmed SBP >170 mmHg; or SBP >160 mmHg accom panied by [CONTACT_23805]) occurs after the interruption of oral antihypertensives, Investigators 
will instruct the patient to promptly resume dosing with their existing sup ply of oral medication.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_164989] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  30 After Month 6, other oral antihypertensives may be used at the discretion of the Investigator, 
following current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Because ALN -AGT01 acts on 
the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin II-receptor blocker [ARB], 
angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue agents for 
high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study. Blood pressure and pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/PD assessments will be collected through Month [ADDRESS_164990] -AGT01 for the liver is hypothesized to improve tolerability 
relative to current oral antihypertensives, [Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] the protocol’s monitoring 
plan is designed to meet the standards set by [CONTACT_144751],[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] with improvements to include the use of the newer 
oral potassium binder patiromer (or with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate  [ZS-9]), if available,  for 
treatment of potential hyperkalemia. [Georgianos and Agarwal 2018; Weir 2015] The risk of 
renal safety events is further mitigated in this study by [CONTACT_144691], which exclude 
patients who are at highest risk to have events (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 
mL/min/1.73m
2, baseline serum potassium >5 mEq/L, poorly controlled diabetes, or severely 
increased albuminuria) and those who may have decreased tolerance for renal safety events 
(patients with clinically significant heart failure, valvular heart disease, or recent history of 
cardiovascular event).  
3.3. Justification for Dose  
The doses of ALN-AGT01 in this study were selected on the basis of data from the Phase [ADDRESS_164991] an acceptable 
safety profile , and clinically significant placebo -corrected reductions in mean SBP >[ADDRESS_164992] s (ie, lowering of serum AGT) and antihypertensive responses. This is expected to enable 
development of population average dose-response relationships for PD and efficacy to guide identification of optimal treatment regimens  (dose and dose frequency) for Phase 3.  
Preliminary PK/PD modeling based on serum AGT data from Study [ADDRESS_164993]-AGT01 results in a dose-dependent lowering of serum AGT,  with maximum reductions 
predicted to be achieved as early as 1 month postdose and  significant reductions sustained for 
close to 6 months after dosing. Modeling of the relationship between serum AGT lowering and blood pressure suggests a log- linear relationship, with ≥92% reduction in serum AGT predicted 
to achieve median SBP reduction of ≥10 mmHg.  
Based on these, the once every 6 month doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg were selected to result in 
median serum AGT reductions of 81.9%, 89.4%, and 94.9%, respectively, at trough (Month 6), 
translating to median SBP reductions of 6.[ADDRESS_164994] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  31 effects. The 300 mg once every 3 months dose is predicted to result in median serum AGT 
reductions of >95% at trough (Month 3), translating to median SBP reductions of >[ADDRESS_164995] -AGT01 as an antihypertensive therapeutic that results in reduction of blood pressure by 
≥10 mmHg throughout the dosing interval with infrequent administration. 
3.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
Using the Interactive Response Technology (IRT), patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_164996] 6 months of the 12-month DB period: 
• Placebo SC once every 3 months 
• [ADDRESS_164997]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_164998]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_164999]-AGT01 SC once every 3 months 
• [ADDRESS_165000]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
Patients initially randomized to placebo will be re -randomized 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_165001] -AGT01 regimens. 
Patients who enter the DB Extension period will continue their current blinded dosing regimen from the DB period. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] 
(mean 24 -hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg) . 
Each patient will be uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and patient identification number. Upon signing the informed consent form (ICF), the patient will be 
assigned a patient identification number by [CONTACT_82550] . The Investigator or his/her designee 
will randomize the patient in IRT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria 
and none of the exclusion criteria. The Investigator or his/her designee will re-randomize the 
patient in IRT at Month [ADDRESS_165002]-AGT01 dose 
groups. 
3.5. Blinding  
The Sponsor, all site personnel (except for the site pharmacist or delegate ), and patients will be 
blinded to study drug treatment through Month [ADDRESS_165003] patient’s Month 6 visit, a limited amount (ie , one- third ) of SBP data will be made 
available to this  small, independent pharmacometrics team for preliminary PK/PD modeling . 
After the database lock to support the analysis of Month 6 data is complete, all other  Sponsor 
personnel will be unblinded to treatment assignment, but the site personnel (except for the site pharmacist)  and patients will remain blinded to treatment assignment until after the analysis of 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165004] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_165005] patient completes the assessments at the Month 12 visit.  
Blinded doses of study drug will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator (see Section  5.2.2). All patients will receive the same volume and number of injections regardless of 
treatment assignment (patients receiving once every [ADDRESS_165006]- AGT01  to maintain the blind). 
Because ALN-AGT01 may be slightly  visually distinguishable from placebo, all blinded study 
drug doses will be prepared and the syringe (s) will be masked by a site pharmacist  or delegate  
prior to administration by a blinded healthcare professional. See the Pharmacy Manual for 
additional details.  
3.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
If the treating physician determines that the clinical management of the patient requires knowledge of the study drug assignment, the Investigator may break the blind, as necessary, in 
IRT. If time permits, clinical study center personnel should contact [CONTACT_144752] [ADDRESS_165007] reached the end of the study if  the patient :

4.3. Removal from Study Drug or Assessment  
Patients or their legal guardians are free to discontinue study drug and/or stop protocol procedural assessments, or participation in the study as a whole at any time and for any reason, 
without penalty to their continuing medical care. The Investigator or the Sponsor may 
discontinue study drug or stop a patient’s participation in the study at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. Any discontinuation of treatment or the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144673]’s participation in  the study must be fully documented in the electronic case report 
form (eCRF) and should be followed up by [CONTACT_737]. 
Discontinuation of study drug or declining procedural assessments is described in Section  4.3.1, 
while the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a patient’s participation in the study is detailed in Section  4.3.2. 
4.3.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug or Declining Procedural Assessments  
Reasons for discontinuation of study drug include any of the following: 
• Significant protocol deviation; which includes required treatment with prohibited 
medication (as defined in Section  5.5.2) per Investigator discretion 
• AE 
• Non-adherence to treatment regimen  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Other reason (non- AE) 
• Or, study is terminated by [CONTACT_144745], the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor or Medical Monitor before 
discontinuing dosing in the patient. Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study 
drug dosing immediately (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for reporting and follow-up of pregnancy). A 
positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug. 
Patients who discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments should not be 
automatically removed from study. In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for 
any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments and 
study visits so that their experience is captured in the final analyses.  
If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1), including different options for follow-up and collection 
of data (eg, in person, by [CONTACT_648], by [CONTACT_2319], through family or friends, or from options not 
involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians or from review 
of medical records), including endpoints and AEs, and must document this decision in the patient’s medical records.

Patients who discontinue from study drug before Month 6 will be encouraged to remain on the study and complete assessments (except study drug administration) through Month 6. They will 
also be asked to complete S afety Follow-up visits once every [ADDRESS_165020] dose of 
study drug per the safety follow- up schedule (see Table 1) until PD recovery  or 12 months 
(whichever is earlier); see Section  3.1. 
Patients who discontinue study drug after the Month 6 visit will be asked to return for their next 
scheduled visit to complete EOT /ET assessments and complete S afety Follow-up visits once 
every [ADDRESS_165021] dose of study drug per the safety follow-up schedule (see Table 1 ) 
until PD recovery or 12 months (whichever is earlier) ; see Section  3.1. 
4.3.2. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient  or Legal Guardian Stops Participation in the Study  
A patient  or their legal guardian  may stop participation in the study at any time. A patient or 
legal guardian considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144653] 6 should be 
informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and 
remain in the study to complete their study assessments through the Month [ADDRESS_165022] the Month 6 visit assessments at an earlier time ( Table 1).  
A patient considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144654] 6 visit should be informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and 
remain in the study to complete the assessments scheduled for the EOT /ET visit and complete 
Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section  4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal 
assessments for which the patient consents.  
If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator 
is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144655]. Data collected from the patient can continue to be used. 
Note, in countries where the collection and processing of the patient’s personal data is based on 
consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process his/her personal data (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), as applicable, personal data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases ) can be included 
after withdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by [CONTACT_1769].

Process Patient’s Personal Data  
Where allowed by [CONTACT_1769], the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, and 
use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the study doctor at any 
time in writing or in any other form that may be locally require d. Also, where allowed by [CONTACT_49762], the patient may object to the collection, storage, and use of his/her personal data, informing 
the study doctor at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required. In both 
cases, the Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information (including any data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samples until the time of 
withdrawal/objection) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as 
applicable,  further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study 
The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this 
is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. However, study integrity and interpretation are 
best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study  assessments and follow-up even if study 
drug is discontinued. 
Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section  8.1.6. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Reason for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation 
The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts will be made to complete and report the 
observations as thoroughly as possible. If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, 
including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. 
4.3.3. Lost to Follow- Up 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_144746]. The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a r equired study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_144753] [for the patient] to continue in the study, and/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_144754] (where possible, 3 
telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s medical record.  
• Should the patient or legal guardian continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study.

(including but not limited to unusual clumsiness, gait abnormalities, and unexplained 
balance/coordination issues that are either absent at or worsening from the baseline) should be 
reported as an AE. If the treatment -emergent AE is persistent and considered related to study 
drug, specialty consultation with a neurologist should be considered. However, if such a 
treatment -emergent AE is serious or severe (regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of 
relatedness), the patient must be referred for neurologist consultation, and study drug dosing 
must be held until that consultation is complete. Resumption of dosing must be approved by [CONTACT_1689].

5.4. Monitoring for Potential Clinical Events  
5.4.1. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hypotension 
Hypotension is an obligate risk of antihypertensive medications. In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure should be monitored weekly  with HBPM to 
ensure the early detection of potential hypotension. Whenever possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698]. 
The following management recommendations for hypotension are provided: 
• Low blood pressure that is associated with symptoms should promptly be evaluated at 
the clinical study site or another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Clinical study site evaluation for low blood pressure should include the assessment of orthostatic blood pressure (eg, supi[INVESTIGATOR_144658]).  
• The Investigator should consider downtitration, interruption, or discontinuation of oral antihypertensives (if taking) if confirmed office SBP <90 mmHg  or if clinical 
symptoms, such as lightheadedness or dizziness , develop coupled with a significantly 
lower SBP compared to prior visits (ie, SBP <1 00 mmHg ). 
• Clinically significant events discovered during the course of a patient’s general medical care should be promptly communicated to the site and evaluated by [CONTACT_737], especially if hypotension is noted. Patients will carry Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) -approved patient cards to facilitate this physician- to-physician 
communication.  
• If hypotension is confirmed, serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured and any oral antihypertensive(s) previously started for hypertensive escape should be down- titrated , interrupted, or discontinued per Investigator judgement.  
• The frequency of blood pressure and biochemical monitoring (serum electrolytes and creatinine) should be increased during intercurrent illnesses that predispose patients to 
dehydration (eg, vomiting or diarrhea that persists for more than 24 hours) or when 
symptoms consistent with decreased effective circulating volume (eg, presyncopal symptoms, unexplained falls, decreased urine output) manifest, even if a patient’s recent blood pressure measurements have been normal.  
• Hypotension that warrants direct evaluation at the site should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours. In addition, other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (eg, unexplained presyncope, syncope, or falls) should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_165039] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  44 • Management of persistent hypotension may include increased salt intake or, if 
unresponsive, standard treatments for orthostatic intolerance syndromes such as fludrocortisone or midodrine. 
• Low blood pressure that requires medical treatment (including intravenous fluid 
support) or other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (see above) 
should be recorded as AEs. 
5.4.2. Monitoring and Approach for Clinically Significant Blood Pressure Elevation 
In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored 
frequently with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential significant elevations. Whenever 
possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698]. The recommended interventions for potentially clinically significant blood pressure elevation are presented in Table 4.  
Table 4: Recommended Interventions for Potentially Clinically Significant Blood 
Pressure Elevation  
Study Period  Intervention  
Throughout Study • Whenever possible, management decisions should be based on blood 
pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698].  
• Any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg  
and/or office DBP ≥120 mmHg) should be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
• Because ALN -AGT01 acts on the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS 
inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue agents for high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study.  
• If added, oral antihypertensives must be used per their labeled instructions 
and in accordance with current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 
2018] 
Day 1 to Month 3 Intervene if clinically significant blood pressure elevation: 
• Because of the gradual onset of effects of ALN-AGT01, interventions for 
asymptomatic hypertension should be avoided in the first 6 weeks after the patient’s first administration of study drug.  
• After Week 6 , patients who develop office SBP >160 mmHg and increased 
>10 mmHg from their baseline office  SBP that persists for ≥24 hours on 2 
consecutive measurements or that is accompanied by [CONTACT_144755]. Severely 
symptomatic patients should be evaluated at the clinical study site or 
another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144659] 24 hours. 
• If persistent hypertension is confirmed (without the identification of a 
specific treatable cause) and the Investigator deems it to be a clinically significant change, treatment may be initiated at the medical discretion of 
the Investigator using a CCB  and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic. 
Investigators should avoid long-acting agents that may not fully washout between Month [ADDRESS_165040] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  45 Study Period  Intervention  
Months 3 to 6 Treat to target blood pressure using a CCB and/ or thiazide /thiazide -like diuretic : 
• At Month 3, a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic may  be added if 
the daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by [CONTACT_44117] . If the Investigator feels 
there is a compelling clinical reason to wait, the rationale for exception 
should be documented in the eCRF.  
• After Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per 
Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above recommended target  per treatment guidelines ( eg, office SBP <140 mmHg, 
HBPM  SBP <135 mmHg, or  daytime  mean  SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135 
mmHg). [Williams 2018] 
• A temporary hold of oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be performed in 
appropriate patients ( below) from Month 5 to Month 6:  
­ Month 5 office
 SBP <160 mmHg if taking no oral antihypertensive 
agents 
­ Month 5 office S
BP <155 mmHg if taking 1 oral antihypertensive agent 
­ Month 5 office

agents.  
• During this 
4-week period, blood pressure will be carefully monitored by

[CONTACT_23805])  
Month 6 to End of 
Study Treat to target blood pressure using Investigator’s choice of oral 
antihypertensive(s ). 
• At Month 6, prior oral antihypertensive may  be restarted per Investigator 
judgement if daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by [CONTACT_44117]. 
• Oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per Investigator 
judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above recommended 
target  per treatment guidelines  (eg, office SBP <140 mmHg; HBPM  SBP 
<135 mmHg; daytime mean SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135  mmHg). [Whelton 2018 ; 
Williams 2018 ] 
5.4.3. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Renal Dysfunction 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of eGFR 
through the anticipated onset of initial ALN-AGT01 PD. Based upon the renal dysfunction 
associated with conventional RAAS inhibitors,[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] the following 
guidelines apply throughout the study: 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥30% from baseline or to ≤30 mL/min/1.73m
2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, contact 
[CONTACT_1034], and look for potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction such as: 
− NSAIDs, antibiotics, or other treatments known to impair renal function 
− Recent exposure to intravenous contrast agents  
− Hypotension

− Urinary infection 
− Urinary tract obstruction 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥40% from baseline or to 
≤25 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, look for 
potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction, and contact [CONTACT_144748]. Serum creatinine should be monitored at least weekly until improving.  
• If a patient is on additional oral antihypertensive agents, the Investigator should consider whether  these agents  should be interrupted, especially during intercurrent 
illness or volume depletion

5.5. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Use of concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1). Concomitant medications include all 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165045] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_165046] not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated. For permitted concomitant 
medications administered SC, do not administer in same injection site area as the study drug for 
[ADDRESS_165047] dose of study drug. 
Patients receiving low- dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (defined as ≤100 mg per day) for at least  [ADDRESS_165048] 2 days prior to ABPM and office 
blood pressure measurements, and alternative analgesics (acetaminophen, topi[INVESTIGATOR_35791]) 
should be considered.[ Whelton 2018] When used, the dosing of systemic NSAIDs should be at 
the lower end of the labeled range and for the shortest duration possible.  
Patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) should 
be on a stable dose for at least  30 days prior to screening and during the study treatment period . 
These medications should not be initiated or discontinued, if possible, during the study treatment period. 
Patients will be allowed to receive vaccines (eg, for SARS -CoV- 2) that have received health 
agency authorization (including for emergency use) by [CONTACT_144703]. Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by [CONTACT_3786], except as described in Section  5.5.2. However, it is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded on the eCRF. 
Concomitant medication will be coded using an internationally recognized and accepted coding 
dictionary. 
5.5.1. Oral Antihypertensive Medication   
Individual initiation and modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator 
judgement are permitted throughout the study if required to treat clinically significant blood 
pressure elevation (Section  5.4.2). In addition, after a patient completes the placebo-controlled 
primary endpoint at Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per 
Investigator judgment for persistent elevations in blood pressure above recommended target per 
treatment guidelines ( eg, office SBP <140 mmHg, HBPM SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean 
SBP by [CONTACT_44117] <135 mmHg ).[Williams 2018 ] All oral antihypertensive medication that are 
dosed once daily should be taken in the morning. 
Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured  at a central or local laboratory  
approximately 2 weeks after any antihypertensive addition or dose titration. 
5.5.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medication  
The following medications, treatments, and supplements are prohibited throughout the study 
treatment period (until the EOT  visit): 
• Conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors)  
• Prescription NSAIDs  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165049] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  49 • Organic nitrate preparations (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide 
dinitrate, pentaerythritol)  
• An RNAi therapeutic (other than ALN -AGT01 ) 
• Medications, herbal supplements (including Ma Huang and St. John’s wort), or other substances (such as licorice) that are associated with increases in LFT abnormalities or with blood pressure abnormalities are prohibited. This includes certain stimulants 
(eg, amphetamine, methylphenidate dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine), MAO 
inhibitors, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709] (eg, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), diet pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (eg, phenylpropanolamine, sibutramine), and nasal decongestants (eg, phenylephrine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine, naphazoline hydrochloride). 
• Medications, herbal medicines, over- the-counter medications, or supplements known 
to cause hyperkalemia are prohibited unless individually approved by [CONTACT_144704]. This includes potassium-sparing diuretics, 
potassium suppl ements, cyclo -oxygenase-[ADDRESS_165050] dose, throughout study participation, and through safety follow-up ( if applicable; see Section  3.1).  
Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include: 
• Placement of an intrauterine device.  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient). 
• Established use of oral (except low-dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165051] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  50 • True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent 
patients must agree to use one of the above-mentioned contraceptive methods if they 
start heterosexual relationships during the study and through safety follow-up ( if 
applicable; Section  3.1). 
Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. 
Females of child -bearing potential include female patients who have experienced menarche (or 
begin menarche over the course of the study), and who are not postmenopausal or permanently 
sterilized (eg, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]). A postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause, confirmed by [CONTACT_144705].  
For male patients, no contraception is required. However, use by [CONTACT_144706] 
(condom) may be required in some countries, eg, [LOCATION_009], in order to comply with local 
requirements as described in the corresponding patient ICFs.  
Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144707] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Pregnancy testing will be 
performed before every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of the study (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.2. Alcohol Restrictions  
Patients should limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 units per day (unit: 1 glass of wine [approximately 125 mL] =1 measure of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_2120] [approximately 1 fluid ounce] =½ pi[INVESTIGATOR_43924] [approximately 284 mL]) for the duration 
of the study. Compliance with alcohol restrictions should be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144708]. 
5.7.3. Tobacco and Nicotine Restrictions  
Use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing 
tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e-cigarettes) must be avoided within [ADDRESS_165052] 1 week prior to screening 
assessments of blood pressure. Of note, this is the sodium intake recommended in the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension Guidelines for both hypertensive patients and for the general population.[ Williams 2018 ]  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165053] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_165054] for ≥10 hours before sample collection ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.5. Exercise  
Patients should abstain from strenuous exercise for [ADDRESS_165055] es and measurement of vital 
signs and weight (at the discretion of the Investigator). 
6.1. Screening Assessments  
An ICF that has been approved by [CONTACT_144709] (IRB)/IEC must be 
signed (in paper or electronic format per local regulations and institutional standards) by [CONTACT_144756]. All patients or their legal guardians will be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF. 
Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria. Rescreening of patients is permitted with consultation of the Medical Monitor (see Section  6.1.2).  
Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained. Any changes to medical history occurring between the screening assessment and Day 1 will be updated prior to study drug administration. 
6.1.1. Retesting  
If in the Investigator’s judgement, the screening laboratory abnormalities are likely to be 
transient, then laboratory tests may be repeated . The Investigator’s rationale should be 
documented. Laboratory values can be retested once during screening provided that the patient 
can be evaluated for eligibility  after at least  2 to 4 weeks of washout (as applicable)  and 
randomized within the allowed Screening period. Retesting of screening ABPM is permitted 
once , with eligibility assessed by [CONTACT_144757]. 
6.1.2. Rescreening  
A patient who does not meet all study eligibility criteria due to a transient condition observed at screening (eg, prohibited medications that were subsequently discontinued) will be allowed to 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165056] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_165057] be repeated. 
6.2. Efficacy Assessments 
All blood pressure measurements ( ABPM, office, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in 
Section  10.1.  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives, a washout of at least  2 to 4 weeks  (as applicable)  must 
be completed prior to measurement of the baseline ABPM (for eligibility) and  baseline office 
blood pressure. The baseline ABPM and office blood pressure must be measured within 2 weeks before randomization. An HBPM unit will be provided during the Screening period to facilitate monitoring during the washout of prior oral antihypertensives (if taking) and to establish the 
HBPM baseline prior to randomization. To establish baseline, [ADDRESS_165058] week  immediately prior to randomization. 
ABPM placement may be performed at home by [CONTACT_144711], as detailed in 
the Study Manual. If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure 
assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained remotely using the methods described in Section 10.1. 
Recommendations for approach and monitoring of low blood pressure/hypotension and 
hypertensive escape are provided in Section  5.4.1 and Section  5.4.2, respectively. 
6.2.1. ABPM  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as rescue medication), ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication.  
Validity  will be assessed for all ABPMs. If the ABPM recording is invalid at any point during 
the study, the patient will be provided [ADDRESS_165059]  be measured  using the automated blood pressure device provided by 
[CONTACT_144712] (prior to taking oral antihypertensives) and at approximately the same time 
each day; therefore, visits should be scheduled at approximately the same time of day, whenever possible. Office blood pressure must include orthostatic measurements (seated and standing).  
Exercise, caffeine, alcohol consumption, and use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products 
(including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 minutes prior to blood pressure measurements. The use 
of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood 
pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) sho uld be avoided within [ADDRESS_165060] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_165061]/caffeine or taking morning oral medications. HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. 
The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet flat on the floor as 
detailed in Section  10.[ADDRESS_165062] sites will be given the option of using a wearable blood pressure 
sensor for 2 periods of 2 to 4 weeks  each  according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). 
Wearable blood pressure assessments performed during screening should be obtained during the last [ADDRESS_165063] as described in the Study Manual , using the opposite arm as that used for ABPM. 
6.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples for determination of AGT and RAAS biomarkers ( plasma renin concentration, 
AngI, Ang II, and aldosterone) will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1).  Blood samples collected  for AngI and AngII require special processing and will be 
assessed at sites that have appropriate resources, equipment, and reagents. Blood samples for PD 
assessments must be collected before study drug administration (on days when study drug is to be dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing (on other days). Blood AGT levels will be analyzed at a central laboratory by [CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent 
assay for measurement of PD effect.  These biomarkers may be analyzed using qualified assays. 
Details regarding the collection, processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and storage of the samples will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Results will not be used to adjust dosing of ALN-AGT01 or guide clinical management and will 
not be shared with sites until after the last patient completes Month [ADDRESS_165064] -AGT01 
and it s primary metabolite AS(N -1)3′ ALN -AGT01 at the time points indicated in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ). A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples 
for PK analysis is in Table 2. 
Plasma concentrations of ALN -AGT01 and AS(N- 1)3′ ALN -AGT01 will be determined using a 
validated assay. Details regarding sample volumes to be collected, and the processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.

including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and laboratory tests. Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded. 
6.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) and include 
blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. When vital signs and blood 
sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs should be performed before blood samples 
are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be measured predose in the seated position, after 
the patient has rested comfortably for approximately  10 minutes. Body temperature in degrees 
Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, or axillary methods. Heart rate will be counted for a 
full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_144674] a full 
minute and recorded in breaths per minute. Blood pressure is described in Section  6.2.  
Additional vital sign assessments, as medially indicated, may be added at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
Vital signs results will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5.2. Weight, Height, and Morphometrics 
Height and body weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded in the eCRF. Height will be measured at screening 
only. Height will be measured in centimeters. Body weight should be measured in kilograms to 
the first decimal point in patients wearing light clothing and without shoes.  
Waist circumference and waist -to-hip- ratio will also be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded on the eCRF. For waist circumference and waist -to-
hip ratio, patients should wear minimal clothing to ensure that the measuring tape is correctly 
positioned. Patients should stand erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, fe et together 
and with their weight equally divided over both legs. To perform the waist measurement, the 
lowest rib margin is first located and marked with a pen. The iliac crest is then palpated in the 
midaxillary line, and also marked. It is recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally 
midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in position around the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus. The elastic tape thus defines the 
level of the waist circumferen ce, which can then be measured by [CONTACT_144713]. Hip circumference measurement should be taken around the widest portion 
of the buttocks. Patients are asked to breathe normally, and to breathe out gently at the time of 
the measurement to prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding their breath. A 
stretch -resistant tape that provides a constant [ADDRESS_165067] centimeter and entered in the source document. Each 
measurement should be repeated twice; if the measurements are within [ADDRESS_165068] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  55 average should be calculated. If the difference between the 2 measurements exceeds 1 cm, the 2 
measurements should be repeated.   
6.5.3. Physical Examination 
Full and symptom-directed physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ); if a physical examination is scheduled for a dosing visit, it should be 
conducted prior to dosing. Full physical examinations will include the examination of the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascul ar, 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and 
neurological status (see the Study Manual for further details on the assessments to be performed 
as part of the neurological evaluation). 
Symptom-directed physical examinations will be guided by [CONTACT_144714], 
or the onset of new symptoms, since the last visit. Neurologic al evaluation should be performed 
according to the Study Manual during all symptom-directed physical examinations regardless of 
whether  neurologic al symptoms  have been experienced by [CONTACT_102] .  
Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on the medical history or AE eCRF. 
6.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead ECGs reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, 
and QT interval and Fridericia -corrected QT interval will be obtained  using a local machine , as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients should be supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_165069] changed since the baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of 
the Investigator, or as per DMC advice. Recordings will be archived according to the Study 
Manual.  
6.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory. Specific 
instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. For any other 
unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug 
administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, 
or as per DMC advice, until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis 
is made to adequately explain the abnormality. Additional safety laboratories and assessments as

Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  56 indicated by [CONTACT_144715]. Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in 
Table 6 and will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).  
While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical decisions, on the day of the assessments all laboratory assessments specified in Table 6 which are performed at the clinic 
should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory. In the case of discrepant local and central 
laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day, central laboratory results will be relied upon for clinical decisions. 
Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical study center or at home by a 
trained healthcare professional. Blood samples collected for RAAS biomarkers should be collected in the  morning and in the seated/upright position ( after blood pressure measurements 
and before any assessments collected in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]). 
Spot urine collections for albumin and creatinine should be obtained in the morning.  
For any safety event or laboratory abnormality, additional laboratory assessments, imaging, and 
consultation may be performed for clinical evaluation and/or in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor; results may be collected and should be included in the cl inical database.

According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and [ADDRESS_165075] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165076] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  60 • Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144663] (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse). 
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest: 
• ALT or AST >3×ULN  
• Severe or serious ISRs; ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or those that lead to temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of ALN-AGT01. 
An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection. “At or near” the 
injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as 
may occur with swelling or hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the 
injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not considered an ISR. 
For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS], respectively.  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
Moderate:  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money). 
Severe:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding 
self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden); OR life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; OR death related to an adverse event. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165077] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_165078] to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity. Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Adverse event severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the 
intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE).  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Drug  
The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by [CONTACT_144716] a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]?” A “yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to the study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should be asked about medically relevant changes 
in the patient’s health since the last visit. The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should 
also be asked if the patient has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and over-the- counter). In addition 
to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient safety. 
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
[CONTACT_144717]. Non- serious AEs will be  followed until the end of study. 
Events occurring after signing of the ICF and before study drug administration will be captured as medical history (see Section  6.1), while AEs that occur after study drug administration, and 
baseline events that worsen after study drug administration, must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by [CONTACT_144718]. SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, unt il baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by [CONTACT_144758], as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug- related. Each AE must be described in 
detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken, 
and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) in the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165079] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_165080] (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the supplemental AEs of 
Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed. Additional clinical and laboratory information may 
be collected. Refer to CRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF.  
For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or Symptoms eCRF, recording additional information regarding each injection site reaction that is entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom(s), injection site location, follow-up actions taken, etc). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the Sponsor or its designee 
should be notified within 24 hours using the appropriate eCRF. [IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737]. Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_165081] the following information: 
• Patient’s study number 
• Description and date of onset of the event 
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug, and 
• Investigator/site information  
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. Within [ADDRESS_165082] information provided in the Study Manual. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by [CONTACT_144720]/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE. These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should be recorded. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by [CONTACT_144721]. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by [CONTACT_144722].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations.

Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  63 [IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the IRB/IEC per their 
institutional policy by [CONTACT_9304] (or Sponsor designee) according to country 
requirements. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_16211]/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through safety follow-up (Section 3.1), the 
Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_165084] dose of study drug. 
The pregnancy should be followed by [CONTACT_144723]. At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE 
as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overdose and Other Special Situations  Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose of study drug administered to the participant or taken by [CONTACT_144724] >2× the assigned dose during a single administration and/or ≥2 doses within ½ 
the intended dosing interval. 
The Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  
In an event of an overdose or other special situations (eg, medication error, abuse, misuse, CPC 
associated with an AE) , the Investigator should: 
• Contact [CONTACT_27909] 24 hours  
• Submit the special situations reporting form within [ADDRESS_165085] information in the Pharmacy Manual 
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities 
• Document the amount of study drug given  
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication will be considered AEs/SAEs.  
Full details of overdose and other special situations reporting instructions will be outlined in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and Biospecimen Repository  
Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144664]. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165086] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_165087]. More generally, genetic variations may account for the 
well-described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with hypertension, as well as 
their responses to treatment.  
Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and patient consent, samples will be collected as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the 
application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may further eluc idate the outcomes of this 
study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or efficacy of ALN -AGT01. 
Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1).  These specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory. Potential exploratory 
investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progression, efficacy, or safety. 
The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety 
laboratory samples, PK samples, etc) that are obtained during the study. 
These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following 
the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations. After [ADDRESS_165088] elapsed, samples will be destroyed. 
Details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_144665]. 
Exploratory analysis of these biospecimens will be performed by [CONTACT_144725].  
When biobanking is permitted by [CONTACT_1295], study participants will be advised during the 
informed consent process of these biobanking details and the potential for exploratory 
investigation of their samples.  
7. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock and unblinding for the 
primary analysis. The plan will detail the implementation of the statistical analyses in accordance 
with the principle features stated in the protocol. 
7.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_165089]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg, and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sample size of 375 patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response signal in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2- sided significance level of 
0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_165090] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)

Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  74 10. APPENDICES  
10.1. Measurement of Blood Pressure  
All blood pressure measurements (office, ABPM, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in the relevant user manuals .  
The appropriately sized cuff for each modality must be used for all assessments. The arm’s circumference at midpoint (halfway between the acromion and olecranon) should be determined 
at screening with a metric tape measure and used to select the appropriat ely sized blood pressure 
cuff/bladder for each instrument as described in the Study Manual. Unless significant weight loss 
or gain occurs between visits, the patient should use the same cuff/bladder size throughout the study. 
At the first Screening visit only, office blood pressure will be measured in both arms to select the 
appropriate arm to use for office blood pressure and HBPM measurements. Unless a concomitant 
condition favors the use of a specific arm, the arm with the higher office SBP should be used for 
all subsequent office blood pressure and HBPM readings. The ABPM should be measured using the patient’s nondominant arm. If the patient is ambidextrous, the same arm used for office blood pressure and HBPM readings should be used. 
ABPM  
The appropriately sized cuff should be placed on the correct arm following the instructions in the 
Study Manual. In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as rescue 
medication), ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication. All ABPM collections must be in the outpatient/ambulatory state.  During screening, ABPM 
recording should be obtained within [ADDRESS_165110] be obtained in advance of the visit (within 7 days 
before the corresponding dosing visit) and  the results  reviewed prior to dosing. 
During the 24-hour monitoring period, patients must avoid strenuous exercise but should otherwise maintain their usual level of physical activity. The ABPM is programmed to take readings every 20 minutes during the day (6 am to 9:59 pm) and every 30 minutes during the 
night (10 pm to 5:59 am). While awake, the patient should hold their arm still by [CONTACT_144736] a reading. Patients must record the timing of going to sleep, waking up, and any oral medications taken during the ABPM, and these responses must be entered into the eCRF.  
After the monitoring period is complete, upload the ABPM data to receive a report with validity  
assessment. An ABPM will be considered valid  if (1) the number of successful daytime readings 
is ≥33, (2) the number of successful nighttime readings is ≥11, and (3) no more than 3 hours are not represented (ie, 3 sections of 60 minutes where 0 valid readings were obtained) . If the ABPM 
recording is invalid at any point during the study, the patient will be provided [ADDRESS_165111] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_165112] be measured using the automated blood pressure device provided by 
[CONTACT_144737]. 
Office blood pressure should be measured early in the visit prior to the morning dose of 
antihypertensive medication, before phlebotomy or other potentially stressful assessments. To 
minimize confounding by [CONTACT_144738], study visits should be scheduled for a consistent timeframe of the day. The use of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 
hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 
inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) should be avoided within 48 hours prior to measuring blood pressure. 
Before measuring blood pressure, confirm that there has been no exercise or use of caffeine or 
nicotine- or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e- cigarettes) with in the last [ADDRESS_165113] blood pressure measurements, ask the patient to use the bathroom before the assessment. 
All office blood pressure assessments will include both seated and standing measurements.  
Seated Office Blood Pressure Measurement:  For seat
 ed measurements, the patient should be in a 
comfortable resting position in a chair with their back supported and their feet flat on the floor. 
• Place the appropriately sized cuff on the correct arm with no clothing between the 
patient’
s arm and the cuff and with the midpoint of the bladder length positioned over 
the brachial artery (located by [CONTACT_23302]). The arm should be supported on an armrest or table with mid -cuff at heart level and the palm facing the ceiling.  
• Follow the Study Manual to initiate the automated blood pressure device’s seated measurement protocol. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by [ADDRESS_165114] 3 individual 
measurements.  
• During the device’s seated measurement protocol, the staff member should leave the 
room and the patient should remain at rest without distraction (avoid mobile phones). The following script may be used: “The blood pressure device works best when you 
are at  rest and without any distraction. If you agree, I would like to leave the room for 
the next [ADDRESS_165115], followed by [CONTACT_2902] 5 minutes of the device inflating to measure your blood pressure”.  
Standing Office Blood Pressure Measurement: A standing measurement should be obtained 
immediately after collection of the seated measurements.  
• Being careful to maintain the cuff’s position, ask the patient to stand with the cuffed arm bent s
lightly and the hand of the cuffed arm supported at heart level.  
• Using a stopwatch or watch, measure standing blood pressure 1 minute after standing 
by [CONTACT_144739]’s single measurement protocol.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165116] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 4, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  76 • After the standing measurement, ask the patient if they experienced dizziness or light-
headedness when standing and enter their response in the eCRF. 
If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute 
“remote visit blood pressure measurement ” may be obtained remotely by a visiting nurse or other 
appropriately trained personnel who will bring an office blood pressure instrument to the 
patient’s location and follow the same procedure performed at the site. If a home visit is not 
possible, a “remote visit blood pressure measurement” should instead be obtained using the 
patient’s HBPM instrument under direct supervision (phone call or teleconferencing) by [CONTACT_144740], following the instructions detailed in the Study Manual. Results and the remote method used should be entered into the eCRF. 
HBPM  
Patients should measure HBPM in the morning, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning 
oral medications.  HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. The HBPM 
measurement should be obtained in a room without distractions, seated comfortably with the 
back supported and feet flat on the floor. The patient will initiate the automated blood pressure 
program on their HBPM device. This program includes a 5- minute period of rest, followed by [ADDRESS_165117] 3 individual measurements.  
To establish baseline, each patient should measure HBPM during the week (with at least 3 
successful readings) immediately prior to randomization. 
After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at least once per week. Patients may select the day of 
the week that is  most convenient for their personal schedule. The frequency of HBPM may  be 
increased in some patients, per Investigator discretion, if more frequent measurement is 
warranted (eg, during screening if patients are undergoing washout and during the temporary hold of oral antihypertensives performed from Month 5 to Month 6).

I have read the ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165123] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 09 December  2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  6 of the study design is provided in Figure 1. Before randomization, patients will discontinue prior 
antihypertensive medications (if taking) for a Washout period of at least 2 weeks  (4 weeks of 
washout is required  for long-acting antihypertensive medications, such as long- acting diuretics or 
calcium channel blockers ). Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for enrollment will receive ALN -AGT01 or placebo for the first 
6 months of the 12-month Double-blind ( DB) treatment period.  
Starting at Month 3, conventional oral antihypertensives may be added per Investigator judgement for elevated blood pressure. Oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be temporarily 
held from Month [ADDRESS_165124]-AGT01 alone (vs placebo) at Month 6 by [CONTACT_46674] ( ABPM ). During this 4-week period, blood pressure 
will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144760]. Patients may resume conventional oral antihypertensives at Month [ADDRESS_165125]-AGT01 open-label extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reaches Month 12 prior 
to availability of the OLE study , they may  continue their current blinded dosing in the DB 
Extension period for up to 12 additional months until the OLE study is open and then transition. 
Number of Planned Patients  
Approximately 375 patients will be enrolled in this study.  
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
This study will include adults (18 to 75 years, inclusive) with untreated hypertension or on stable 
therapy with [ADDRESS_165126] a daytime mean 
systolic blood pressure ( SBP) ≥135 mmHg and ≤[ADDRESS_165127]- AGT01 is a n SC administered N -acetylgalactosamine -conjugated small interfering RNA 
targeting liver -expressed messenger RNA for angiotensinogen (AGT). 
Patients randomized to receive ALN -AGT01 will be administered [ADDRESS_165128] -AGT01 beginning at Month 6.  
Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Placebo (sodium chloride 0.9% w/v for SC administration) will be administered once every [ADDRESS_165129] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_165130] -AGT01 is up to 24 months. The estimated total time on 
study for each patient is up to 38 months, including up to 2 months of screening, followed by [CONTACT_25765] 24 months of treatment, and up to 12 months in the Follow-up period. 
Statistical Methods  
The planned enrollment for this study is 375 patients. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] (mean 24- hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg). 
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_165131]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg,  and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sample size of 
375 patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response relationship in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a 
[ADDRESS_165132] -AGT01 dose versus placebo with a 2 -sided 
significance level of 0.05.  
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows:  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by- treatment analyses based on the FAS will be according to the 
randomized treatment arm.  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug, grouped 
according to the treatment actually received.  
• Pharmacokinetic ( PK) Analysis Set : All patients who received at least [ADDRESS_165133] 1 nonmissing postdose PK assessment . 
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose  of study drug. All by -
treatment analyses based on the PD Analysis Set will be grouped according to the 
treatment actually received.  
• All ALN- AGT01 Treated Set:  All patients who received any amount of [ADDRESS_165134] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)

1.1. Study Rationale  
Study ALN- AGT01 -002 (KARDIA -1) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-
ranging, multicenter Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics ( PD) of ALN -AGT01, administered SC, in patients with mild -to-moderate 
hypertension. Patients will be randomized to [ADDRESS_165149] 6 months of the 12-month Double-blind (DB) period. After the first [ADDRESS_165150]-AGT01 open- label 
extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reaches Month [ADDRESS_165151] on systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 
Month 3, as assessed by [CONTACT_46674] (ABPM). Se condary and 
exploratory objectives of the study include evaluating the efficacy of ALN-AGT01 on other measures of blood pressure response and evaluating the PD effect of ALN -AGT01, including 
reduction in circulating AGT concentration. 
The full rationale for the study and design is presented in Section  3.2. 
1.2. Background  
Hypertension affects 30% to 45% of adults and is the strongest modifiable risk factor for 
cardiovascular  disease, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction.[ Olsen 2016; Williams 2018 ] 
The worldwide disease burden is profound, with a global prevalence of over 1 billion,[ Kearney 
2005; NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017] and approximately 9 million deaths attributed to hypertension annually.[ Angell 2015] 
Currently available pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144672] a minority of 
patients, due in large part to  physician inertia and patient nonadherence to  daily oral 
medication. [Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Low adherence to oral antihypertensives is 
associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes and is prevalent at all stages of disease. [Corrao 
2011; Peacock and Krousel -Wood 2017; Schulz 2016; van der Laan 2017] Thus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_144669], current rates of control are low , and the global burden 
of death and disability- adjusted life -years attributed to elevated blood pressure remains 
high.[ Forouzanfar 2017; Muntner 2020] Development of new approaches to treat hypertension

Amendment 3, 09 December  2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  23 and to overcome the limitations of current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217] a key unmet need.[ Dzau and Balatbat 
2019; McClellan 2019; Services 2020] 
The Sponsor is developi[INVESTIGATOR_144647]- AGT01, a novel synthetic RNA interference ( RNAi ) 
therapeutic, for SC administration for the treatment of hypertension. RNAi is a naturally 
occurring cellular mechanism for regulation of gene expression, mediated through the binding of 
siRNA to its complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, leading to mRNA cleavage and subsequent suppression of the synthesis and levels of the target protein. ALN- AGT01 
contains an siRNA targeting AGT  mRNA, conjugated to a GalNAc-containing liga nd to facilitate 
delivery to the liver. Based on the mechanism of RNAi, ALN-AGT01 is specifically designed to reduce the hepatic synthesis of AGT protein, the first substrate in the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sole precursor of vasoactive angiotensin peptides.[ Khanna 
2017; Romero 2015] Because hepatocytes are the predominant source of circulating AGT, 
ALN-AGT01 has been developed to reduce blood pressure by [CONTACT_144742] (AngII). 
Preliminary d ata from  Part A of the ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_165153]- AGT01 -001 (hereafter referred 
to as Study 001) in patients with hypertension have shown that  single SC doses of ALN- AGT01 
lead to dose-dependent and durable reductions in circulating AGT, accompanied by [CONTACT_144685] (DBP). Reductions in AGT for up to 
[ADDRESS_165154] adverse events (AEs) have been mild or moderate in severity, and there have been no 
severe or serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study drug. There have been no clinically significant elevations in serum creatinine or serum potassium, and no patient has required 
intervention for low blood pressure. No clinically significant alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) 
elevation s have been observed in Part A  patients who received ALN-AGT01 doses as high as 
800 mg. Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported in  a minority of patients and were all mild 
and transient events that resolved without intervention. 
This Phase [ADDRESS_165155]-AGT01 across a 
range of doses (150 to 600 mg) and dose intervals (once every 3 months and once every 6 
months) to identify optimal treatment. The  consistent and prolonged PD effect of ALN -AGT01  
is expected to achieve the unique benefit of continuous 24-hour blood pressure lowering with 
infrequent SC dosing.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ALN-AGT01 is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
Clinical data available from Study [ADDRESS_165156] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_165157]-AGT01, administered SC, in patients 
with mild -to-moderate hypertension. A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 1. 
Before randomization, patients will discontinue prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) for 
a Washout period of at least 2 weeks  (4 weeks of washout is required  for long- acting 
antihypertensive medications, such as long- acting diuretics or calcium channel blockers  [CCBs]) .  
DB and DB Extension Period s 
Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
enrollment will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive 1 of the following regimens over a 12-month 
DB treatment period. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] (mean 24- hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg) .  
• Placebo SC once every 3 months, with re -randomization (1:1:1:1) at Month [ADDRESS_165158] -AGT01 regimens 
• [ADDRESS_165159]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_165160]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_165161]-AGT01 SC once every 3 months 
• [ADDRESS_165162]- AGT01  to maintain the blind. 
At Month 3, conventional oral antihypertensives may be added per Investigator judgement for daytime mean SBP ≥ 135 mmHg  by [CONTACT_44117]. After Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications 
may also be added per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above target (target defined as office SBP <140 mmHg, home blood pressure monitoring [ HBPM ] SBP 
<135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP <135 mmHg  by [CONTACT_44117] ). Oral antihypertensives (if taking) 
will be temporarily held from Month 5 to Month 6 in appropriate patients (Month 5 office SBP <155 mmHg if taking 1 oral antihypertensive agent or office SBP <150 mmHg if taking 2 agents) to assess the effect of ALN -AGT01 alone (vs placebo) at Month 6 by [CONTACT_44117]. During this 
4-week period, blood pressure will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144761] >170 mmHg (or if confirmed office SBP >160 mmHg accompanied by [CONTACT_23805]). 
Patients may be eligible to participate in an ALN -AGT01 OLE study upon completion of the 
Month 12 predose assessments. If an individual patient reaches Month 12 prior to availability of 
the OLE study, they may continue their current blinded dosing in the DB Extension period for up 
to 12 additional months until the OLE study is open and then transition. Once the OLE study is 
open for enrollment, eligible patients may rollover into the OLE study at Months 12, 18, or 24 (whichever visit occurs first).  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165163] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_165164] dose of 
study drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline level (if 
known) or until [ADDRESS_165165] dose of study drug, whichever comes earlier.  
Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will also  be asked to complete the 
remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration) 
through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, end of treatment 
(EOT)/ early termination ( ET) assessments should be performed. 
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 375 patients  (75 patients per group). 
The duration of treatment with ALN -AGT01 is up to [ADDRESS_165166]-AGT01 across a range of doses and 
dose intervals to identify optimal treatment regimens for study in Phase 3. 
Patients will discontinue prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) for 2 to 4 weeks prior to 
study drug administration. During the study, blood pressure will be monitored with both 
outpatient 24-hour ABPM and automated office blood pressure measurements 
(EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016). The primary endpoint will be assessed by [CONTACT_144743]. In addition, 24-hour ABPM can 
assess short -term blood pressure variability and circadian patterns (including potential restoration 
of the normal nocturnal blood pressure dippi[INVESTIGATOR_144650] 21% to 35% of hypertensive 
patients). [de la Sierra 2009 ; White 1998] More frequent measurements will be collected through 
a third method, oscillometric HBPM, to assess long-term blood pressure variability and provide 
close safety monitoring for potential hypotension (or hypertension) while not in the clinic. 
As recommended by [CONTACT_144688] (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH] Principles for Clinical Evaluation of New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000 and EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016), the first [ADDRESS_165167] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 09 December  2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  28 modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator judgement to maintain blood 
pressure within target is permitted starting at Month 3 and will continue throughout the study 
(except between Month 5 and Month 6 as described in Section  3.1). Separate from these treat -to-
target modifications, any confirmed event of severe hypertension ( office SBP ≥180 mmHg or 
DBP ≥120 mmHg) will be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
If a patient requires treatment with a conventional oral antihypertensive before Month 6, a CCB 
and/or thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic will be added because there is extensive experience 
combining these classes with antihypertensive drugs that impact the RAAS. Additionally, their 
blood pressure effects are expected to washout within [ADDRESS_165168] -AGT01 at Month 6 (trough for the 
once every 6 month regimens) relative to placebo  is critical to evaluate the feasibility of once 
every 6 month dosing regimens for future study in Phase 3. Accordingly, oral antihypertensives 
(if taking) will be temporarily held from Month 5 to the Month 6 ABPM assessment. For each 
patient, this limited interruption in oral antihypertensives will be contingent upon the patient’s Month 5 office SBP being adequately controlled (see Table 4 ) and the Investigator’s assessment 
that interruption can be safely performed and carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144762]. Of note, a withdrawal period is a standard element in studies of oral antihypertensives that is often used to establish assay sensitivity, to demonstrate maintenance of 
efficacy, and to assess possible withdrawal effects (ICH E12A; Principles for Clinical Evaluation 
of New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000). Outside of research studies, antihypertensives are 
temporarily discontinued in clinical practice for diagnostic purposes, and interruptions up to [ADDRESS_165169] been shown to  be safe. [Beeftink 2017] In this study, the period of interruption is 
limited to [ADDRESS_165170] -AGT01. If a clinically significant blood pressure elevation (confirmed SBP >170 
mmHg; or SBP >160 mmHg accompanied by [CONTACT_23805]) occurs after the interruption of oral antihypertensives, Investigators will instruct the patient to promptly resume dosing with their existing supply of oral medication.  
After Month 6, other oral antihypertensives may be used at the discretion of the Investigator, 
following current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Because ALN -AGT01 acts on 
the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin II-receptor blocker [ARB], 
angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue agents for 
high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study. Blood pressure and pharmacokinetic (PK)/PD assessments will be collected through Month [ADDRESS_165171] -AGT01 for the liver is hypothesized to improve tolerability 
relative to current oral antihypertensives, [Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] the protocol’s monitoring 
plan is designed to meet the standards set by [CONTACT_144690],[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] with improvements to include the use of the newer 
oral potassium binder patiromer (or with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate  [ZS-9]), if available,  for 
treatment of potential hyperkalemia. [Georgianos and Agarwal 2018; Weir 2015] The risk of 
renal safety events is further mitigated in this study by [CONTACT_144691], which exclude 
patients who are at highest risk to have events (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 mL/min/1.73m
2, baseline serum potassium >5 mEq/L, poorly controlled diabetes, or severely 
increased albuminuria) and those who may have decreased tolerance for renal safety events

cardiovascular event).  
3.3. Justification for Dose  
The doses of ALN-AGT01 in this study were selected on the basis of data from the Phase [ADDRESS_165173] an acceptable 
safety profile , and clinically significant placebo -corrected reductions in mean SBP >[ADDRESS_165174] s (ie, lowering of serum AGT) and antihypertensive responses. This is expected to enable 
development of population average dose-response relationships for PD and efficacy to guide 
identification of optimal treatment regimens  (dose and dose frequency) for Phase 3.  
Preliminary PK/PD modeling based on serum AGT data from Study [ADDRESS_165175]-AGT01 results in a dose-dependent lowering of serum AGT,  with maximum reductions 
predicted to be achieved as early as 1 month postdose and  significant reductions sustained for 
close to 6 months after dosing. Modeling of the relationship between serum AGT lowering and blood pressure suggests a log- linear relationship, with ≥92% reduction in serum AGT predicted 
to achieve median SBP reduction of ≥10 mmHg.  
Based on these, the once every 6 month doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg were selected to result in 
median serum AGT reductions of 81.9%, 89.4%, and 94.9%, respectively, at trough (Month 6), 
translating to median SBP reductions of 6.67 mmHg, 8.74 mmHg, and 11.6 mmHg, respectively. 
Thus, the selected doses will enable characterization of the dose-response relationships for serum 
AGT and blood pressure with the once every 6 month regimen. 
The selected doses also enable characterization of the dose-response relationships for serum 
AGT and blood pressure with once every 3 month regimens based on analysis of data from all 
arms  at Month 3. This will provide support for development of a once every 3 month regimen, if 
desired . To this end, 300 mg once every 3 months will be evaluated to identify any cumulative 
effects. The 300 mg once every 3 months dose is predicted to result in median serum AGT reductions of >95% at trough (Month 3), translating  to median SBP reductions of >[ADDRESS_165176] -AGT01 as an antihypertensive therapeutic that results in reduction of blood pressure by 
≥10 mmHg throughout the dosing interval with infrequent administration.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  30 • [ADDRESS_165181]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
Patients initially randomized to placebo will be re -randomized 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_165182] -AGT01 regimens. 
Patients who enter the DB Extension period will continue their current blinded dosing regimen 
from the DB period. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] 
(mean 24 -hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg) . 
Each patient will be uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and patient identification number. Upon signing the informed consent form (ICF), the patient will be 
assigned a patient identification number by [CONTACT_82550] . The Investigator or his/her designee 
will randomize the patient in IRT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria 
and none of the exclusion criteria. The Investigator or his/her designee will re-randomize the 
patient in IRT at Month [ADDRESS_165183]-AGT01 dose 
groups. 
3.5. Blinding  
The Sponsor, all site personnel (except for the site pharmacist or delegate ), and patients will be 
blinded to study drug treatment through Month [ADDRESS_165184] patient’s Month 6 visit,  serum AGT, PK, 
and a limited amount (ie , one- third ) of SBP data and treatment assignment using dummy IDs will 
be made available to a small, independent pharmacometrics team at  the Sponsor that  will not be 
involved in the conduct or oversight of the study. After the database lock to support the analysis of Month 6 data is complete, all other  Sponsor personnel will be unblinded to treatment 
assignment, but the site personnel (except for the site pharmacist)  and patients will remain 
blinded to treatment assignment until after  the analysis of Month [ADDRESS_165185] patient 
completes the assessments at the Month 12 visit. 
Blinded doses of study drug will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator (see 
Section  5.2.2). All patients will receive the same volume and number of injections regardless of 
treatment assignment (patients receiving once every [ADDRESS_165186]- AGT01  to maintain the blind). 
Because ALN-AGT01 may be slightly  visually distinguishable from placebo, all blinded study 
drug doses will be prepared and the syringe (s) will be masked by a site pharmacist  or delegate  
prior to administration by a blinded healthcare professional. See the Pharmacy Manual for 
additional details.  
3.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
If the treating physician determines that the clinical management of the patient requires knowledge of the study drug assignment, the Investigator may break the blind, as necessary, in 
IRT. If time permits, clinical study center personnel should contact [CONTACT_144752] [ADDRESS_165187] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)

discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1), including different options for follow-up and collection 
of data (eg, in person, by [CONTACT_648], by [CONTACT_2319], through family or friends, or from options not 
involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians or from review 
of medical records), including endpoints and AEs, and must document this decision in the patient’s medical records.  
If a patient discontinues dosing due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason 
must be recorded in the eCRF. Patients who discontinue study drug and remain on study may 
receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator 
judgement, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue from study drug before Month 6 will be encouraged to remain on the 
study and complete assessments (except study drug administration) through Month 6. They will 
also be asked to complete S afety Follow-up visits once every [ADDRESS_165199] dose of 
study drug per the safety follow- up schedule (see Table 1)  until PD recovery  or 12 months 
(whichever is earlier); see Section  3.1. 
Patients who discontinue study drug after the Month 6 visit will be asked to return for their next scheduled visit to complete EOT /ET assessments and complete S afety Follow-up visits once 
every [ADDRESS_165200] dose of study drug per the safety follow-up schedule (see Table 1 ) 
until PD recovery or 12 months (whichever is earlier) ; see Section  3.1.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient  or Legal Guardian Stops Participation in the Study  
A patient  or their legal guardian  may stop participation in the study at any time. A patient or 
legal guardian considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144653] 6 should be 
informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study to complete their study assessments through the Month [ADDRESS_165202] the Month 6 visit assessments at an 
earlier time ( Table 1).  
A patient considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144654] 6 visit should be 
informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and 
remain in the study to complete the assessments scheduled for the EOT /ET visit and complete 
Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section  4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal 
assessments for which the patient consents.  
If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144655]. Data collected from the patient can continue to be used. 
Note, in countries where the collection and processing of the patient’s personal data is based on 
consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process his/her personal data (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), as applicable, personal data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as 
appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases ) can be included 
after withdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by [CONTACT_1769].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data or Objection to 
Process Patient’s Personal Data  
Where allowed by [CONTACT_1769], the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, and 
use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the study doctor at any 
time in writing or in any other form that may be locally require d. Also, where allowed by [CONTACT_49762], the patient may object to the collection, storage, and use of his/her personal data, informing 
the study doctor at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required. In both 
cases, the Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information (including any 
data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samples until the time of withdrawal/objection) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as applicable,  further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study 
The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. However, study integrity and interpretation are 
best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study  assessments and follow-up even if study 
drug is discontinued.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  37 Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section  8.1.6. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Reason for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation 
The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible. If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. 
4.3.3. Lost to Follow- Up 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_144746]. The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a r equired study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_144763] [for the patient] to continue in the study, and/or should continue 
in the study. 
• Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_144754] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_144764]’s medical record.  
• Should the patient or legal guardian continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study. 
• For patients who are lost to follow-up, the Investigator can search publicly available records (where permitted and allowed by [CONTACT_1769]) to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible. 
4.3.4. Replacement of Study Patients  
No additional patients may be enrolled to mitigate the impact of patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study.  
5. TREATMENTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS  
5.1. Treatments Administered  
Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study 
and must not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. Study drug that has been 
dispensed and returned unused must not be re-dispensed.

Dose modifications are not permitted.  
If a study drug- related AE occurs in a patient that the Investigator judges as presenting a 
potential risk to the patient for further dosing, the study drug dose may be held at the discretion of the Investigator and the Medical Monitor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
5.2.4. Liver Function Test Criteria for Withholding, Monitoring and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144671]  
1. Dosing decisions may be made based on the most recently available liver function test 
(LFT) results  from a central laboratory  (Table 6 ). 
2. For any ALT or AST elevation >3×ULN, central laboratory results should be used to guide subsequent monitoring as detailed in Table 3. 
3. For any ALT or AST elevation >3×ULN: 
a. If local laboratory results are obtained, confirm with a central laboratory as soon as 
possible, ideally within [ADDRESS_165213] elevation >3×ULN without alternative cause that is accompanied 
by [CONTACT_144696] (eg, nausea, right upper quadrant 
abdominal pain, jaundice) or elevated bilirubin to ≥2×ULN or INR ≥1.5, permanently

ratio; LFT=liver function test(s); ULN=upper limit of normal.  
Notes: In addition to these criteria, other assessments or evaluations may be performed per Investigator discretion, 
as appropriate.  
5.2.5. Neurological Criteria for Withholding, Monitoring, and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144656] 
(including but not limited to unusual clumsiness, gait abnormalities, and unexplained 
balance/coordination issues that are either absent at or worsening from the baseline) should be reported as an AE. If the treatment -emergent AE is persistent and considered related to study 
drug, specialty consultation with a neurologist should be considered. However, if such a treatment -emergent AE is serious or severe (regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of 
relatedness), the patient must be referred for neurologist consultation, and study drug dosing 
must be held until that consultation is complete. Resumption of dosing must be approved by [CONTACT_5134]. 
5.2.6. Preparation, Handling, and Storage 
Staff at each clinical study center will be responsible for preparation of ALN -AGT01 or placebo 
doses according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. No special procedures for the 
safe handling of study drug are required. 
ALN- AGT01  will be stored and refrigerated at approximately  2 to 30°C until dose preparation. 
Deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor and use 
of ALN- AGT01  halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided by [CONTACT_31172], as described in the Pharmacy Manual.  
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
Instructions specific to unused study drug and additional storage will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.

Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_165216]- AGT01 will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or 
destroyed at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations. 
Further instructions about drug accountability will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.3. Clinical Product Complaints  
5.3.1. Definition  
A clinical product complaint (CPC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of the study drug and its packaging after it is released for distribution to the site at which study drug will be administered. 
A CPC may be detected prior to use of study drug, during use, or after use. A CPC is typi[INVESTIGATOR_144657]; however, it is possible that study drug complaints could be associated with 
an AE. Examples of a CPC include, but are not limited to: illegible clinical label, missing clinical 
label, damaged vial, empty vial, and contamination of study drug. 
5.3.2. Reporting  
For product complaints, the Sponsor or its designee should be notified within [ADDRESS_165217] be 
evaluated and reported as indicated in Section  6.5.6. Detailed instructions on reporting CPCs will 
be provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.4. Monitoring for Potential Clinical Events  
5.4.1. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hypotension 
Hypotension is an obligate risk of antihypertensive medications. In addition to office blood 
pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored weekly with HBPM to ensure 
the early detection of potential hypotension. Whenever possible, manage ment decisions will be 
based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698]. 
The following management recommendations for hypotension are provided: 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165218] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 09 December  2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  42 • Low blood pressure that is associated with symptoms should promptly be evaluated at 
the clinical study site or another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Clinical study site evaluation for low blood pressure should include the assessment of orthostatic blood pressure (eg, supi[INVESTIGATOR_144658]).  
• The Investigator should consider downtitration, interruption, or discontinuation of oral antihypertensives (if taking) if confirmed office SBP <90 mmHg  or if clinical 
symptoms, such as lightheadedness or dizziness , develop coupled with a significantly 
lower SBP compared to prior visits (ie, SBP <1 00 mmHg ). 
• Clinically significant events discovered during the course of a patient’s general medical care should be promptly communicated to the site and evaluated by [CONTACT_737], especially if hypotension is noted. Patients will carry Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) -approved patient cards to facilitate this physician- to-physician 
communication.  
• If hypotension is confirmed, serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured and any oral antihypertensive(s) previously started for hypertensive escape should be down- titrated , interrupted, or discontinued per Investigator judgement.  
• The frequency of blood pressure and biochemical monitoring (serum electrolytes and creatinine) should be increased during intercurrent illnesses that predispose patients to 
dehydration (eg, vomiting or diarrhea that persists for more than 24 hours) or when 
symptoms consistent with decreased effective circulating volume (eg, presyncopal symptoms, unexplained falls, decreased urine output) manifest, even if a patient’s recent blood pressure measurements have been normal.  
• Hypotension that warrants direct evaluation at the site should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours. In addition, other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (eg, unexplained presyncope, syncope, or falls) should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the site being no tified.  
• Management of persistent hypotension may include increased salt intake or, if unresponsive, standard treatments for orthostatic intolerance syndromes such as fludrocortisone or midodrine. 
• Low blood pressure that requires medical treatment (including intravenous fluid support) or other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (see above) should be recorded as AEs. 
5.4.2. Monitoring and Approach for Clinically Significant Blood Pressure Elevation 
In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored frequently with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential significant elevations. Whenever 
possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by 
[CONTACT_144698]. The recommended interventions for potentially clinically significant blood pressure elevation are presented in Table 4.

Throughout Study • Whenever possible, management decisions should be based on blood 
pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698].  
• Any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg  
and/or office DBP ≥120 mmHg) should be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
• Because ALN -AGT01 acts on the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS 
inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue 
agents for high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study.  
• If added, oral antihypertensives must be used per their labeled instructions 
and in accordance with current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 
2018] 
Day 1 to Month 3 Intervene if clinically significant blood pressure elevation: 
• Because of the gradual onset of effects of ALN-AGT01, interventions for 
asymptomatic hypertension should be avoided in the first 6 weeks after the 
patient’s first administration of study drug.  
• After Week 6 , patients who develop office SBP >160 mmHg and increased 
>10 mmHg from their baseline office  SBP that persists for ≥24 hours on 2 
consecutive measurements or that is accompanied by [CONTACT_144699]. Severely 
symptomatic patients should be evaluated at the clinical study site or another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144659] 24 hours. 
• If persistent hypertension is confirmed (without the identification of a 
specific treatable cause) and the Investigator deems it to be a clinically significant change, treatment may be initiated at the medical discretion of the Investigator using a CCB  and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic. 
Investigators should avoid long-acting agents that may not fully washout 
between Month 5 and Month 6. 
Months 3 to 6 Treat to target blood pressure using a CCB and/ or thiazide /thiazide -like diuretic : 
• At Month 3, a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic should be added 
if the daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by [CONTACT_44117] . If the Investigator feels 
there is a compelling clinical reason to wait, the rationale for exception should be documented in the eCRF.  
• After Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per 
Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above 
target (target defined as office SBP <140 mmHg , HBPM  SBP <135 mmHg, 
or daytime  mean  SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135 mmHg). [Williams 2018 ]

judgement if daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by [CONTACT_44117]. 
• Oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per Investigator 
judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above target (target 
defined as office SBP <140 mmHg; HBPM  SBP <135 mmHg; daytime 
mean SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135 mmHg). [Whelton 2018 ; Williams 2018 ] 
5.4.3. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Renal Dysfunction 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of eGFR 
through the anticipated onset of initial ALN-AGT01 PD. Based upon the renal dysfunction 
associated with conventional RAAS inhibitors,[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] the following 
guidelines apply throughout the study: 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥30% from baseline or to 
≤30 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, contact 
[CONTACT_1034], and look for potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction such as: 
− NSAIDs, antibiotics, or other treatments known to impair renal function 
− Recent exposure to intravenous contrast agents  
− Hypotension 
− Hypovolemia 
− Urinary infection 
− Urinary tract obstruction 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥40% from baseline or to 
≤25 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, look for 
potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction, and contact [CONTACT_144748]. Serum creatinine should be monitored at least 
weekly until improving.  
• If a patient is on additional oral antihypertensive agents, the Investigator should consider whether  these agents  should be interrupted, especially during intercurrent 
illness or volume depletion

Use of concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1). Concomitant medications include all 
prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the counter medications, vitamins, and 
minerals. Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the eCRF. 
Standard vitamins and topi[INVESTIGATOR_144660]. However, topi[INVESTIGATOR_144661](s) unless medically indicated. For permitted concomitant medications administered SC, do not administer in same injection site area as the study drug for [ADDRESS_165225] dose of study drug. 
Patients receiving low- dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (defined as ≤100 mg per day) for at least  [ADDRESS_165226] 7 days prior to ABPM and office blood pressure measurements, and alternative analgesics (acetaminophen, topi[INVESTIGATOR_35791]) 
should be considered.[ Whelton 2018] When used, the dosing of systemic NSAIDs should be at 
the lower end of the labeled range and for the shortest duration possible.  
Patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) should 
be on a stable dose for at least  30 days prior to screening and during the study treatment period . 
These medications should not be initiated or discontinued, if possible, during the study treatment 
period. 
Patients will be allowed to receive vaccines (eg, for SARS -CoV- 2) that have received health 
agency authorization (including for emergency use) by [CONTACT_144703]. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by [CONTACT_3786], except as described in Section  5.5.2. However, it is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded on the eCRF. 
Concomitant medication will be coded using an internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary. 
5.5.1. Oral Antihypertensive Medication   
Individual initiation and modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator 
judgement are permitted throughout the study if required to treat clinically significant blood 
pressure elevation (Section  5.4.2). In addition, after a patient completes the placebo -controlled 
primary endpoint at Month 3, Investigators will titrate therapy with oral antihypertensives to a 
target blood pressure range (office SBP <140 mmHg, HBPM SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime 
mean SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135  mmHg ). All oral antihypertensive medication that are dosed once 
daily should be taken in the morning. 
Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured  at a central or local laboratory  
approximately 2 weeks after any antihypertensive addition or dose titration.

methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent patients must agree to use one of the above-mentioned contraceptive methods if they 
start heterosexual relationships during the study and through safety follow-up ( if 
applicable; Section  3.1). 
Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth 
control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. 
Females of child -bearing potential include female patients who have experienced menarche (or 
begin menarche over the course of the study), and who are not postmenopausal or permanently 
sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or bilateral s alpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]). A 
postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause, confirmed by [CONTACT_144766].  
For male patients, no contraception is required. However, use by [CONTACT_144706] 
(condom) may be required in some countries, eg, [LOCATION_009], in order to comply with local requirements as described in the corresponding patient ICFs.  
Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144707] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Pregnancy testing will be 
performed before every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of the study (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.2. Alcohol Restrictions  
Patients should limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is limited 
to no more than 2 units per day (unit: 1 glass of wine [approximately 125 mL] =1 measure of

On days on which samples for fasting lipid panel and glycemic assessments are collected, patients are required to fast for ≥10 hours before sample collection ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.5. Exercise  
Patients should abstain from strenuous exercise for [ADDRESS_165231] es and measurement of vital 
signs and weight (at the discretion of the Investigator). 
6.1. Screening Assessments  
An ICF that has been approved by [CONTACT_144709] (IRB)/IEC must be signed (in paper or electronic format per local regulations and institutional standards) by [CONTACT_144767]. All patients or their legal guardians will be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF. 
Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria. Rescreening of patients is permitted with consultation of the Medical Monitor (see Section  6.1.2).  
Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained. Any changes to medical history occurring between the screening assessment and Day 1 will be updated prior to study drug administration. 
6.1.1. Retesting  
If in the Investigator’s judgement, the screening laboratory abnormalities are likely to be 
transient, then laboratory tests may be repeated . The Investigator’s rationale should be 
documented. Laboratory values can be retested once during screening provided that the patient can be evaluated for eligibility  after at least  2 to 4 weeks of washout (as applicable)  and 
randomized within the allowed Screening period. Retesting of screening ABPM is permitted once as described in Section  6.2.1, with eligibility assessed by [CONTACT_144757]. 
6.1.2. Rescreening  
A patient who does not meet all study eligibility criteria due to a transient condition observed at screening (eg, prohibited medications that were subsequently discontinued) will be allowed to 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165232] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_165233] be repeated. 
6.2. Efficacy Assessments 
All blood pressure measurements ( ABPM, office, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in 
Section  10.1.  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives, a washout of at least  2 to 4 weeks  (as applicable)  must 
be completed prior to measurement of the baseline ABPM (for eligibility) and  baseline office 
blood pressure. The baseline ABPM and office blood pressure must be measured within 2 weeks before randomization. An HBPM unit will be provided during the Screening period to facilitate monitoring during the washout of prior oral antihypertensives (if taking) and to establish the 
HBPM baseline prior to randomization. HBPM must be collected after at least  2 to 4 weeks of 
washout (as applicable) for at least 2 consecutive weeks (at least 3 recordings per week) prior to 
randomization to establish baseline . 
ABPM placement may be performed at home by [CONTACT_144711], as detailed in 
the Study Manual. If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained remotely using the methods described in Section 10.1. 
Recommendations for approach and monitoring of low blood pressure/hypotension and 
hypertensive escape are provided in Section  5.4.1 and Section  5.4.2, respectively. 
6.2.1. ABPM  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as rescue medication), ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication.  
Adequacy will be assessed for all ABPMs. If the ABPM recording is inadequate, the patient will 
be provided [ADDRESS_165234]  be measured  using the automated blood pressure device provided by 
[CONTACT_144712] (prior to taking oral antihypertensives) and at approximately the same time 
each day; therefore, visits should be scheduled at approximately the same time of day, whenever possible. Office blood pressure must include orthostatic measurements (seated and standing).  
Exercise, caffeine, alcohol consumption, and use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products 
(including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or 
e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 minutes prior to blood pressure measurements. The use 
of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, 
tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) should be avoided within [ADDRESS_165235] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_165236]/caffeine or taking morning oral medications. HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. 
The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet flat on the floor as 
detailed in Section  10.[ADDRESS_165237] sites will be given the option of using a wearable blood 
pressure sensor for 2 periods of 2 to 4 weeks  each  according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1). Wearable blood pressure assessments performed during screening should be obtained 
after at least  2 to 4 weeks of washout (as applicable) . Participation will be contingent upon 
individual patient consent. These noninvasive, cuffless devices are worn on the finger or wrist as 
described in the Study Manual, using the opposite arm as that used for ABPM. 
6.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples for determination of AGT and RAAS biomarkers ( plasma renin concentration, 
AngI, Ang II, and aldosterone) will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1).  Blood samples collected  for AngI and AngII require special processing and will be 
assessed at sites that have appropriate resources, equipment, and reagents. Blood samples for PD 
assessments must be collected before study drug administration (on days when study drug is to be dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing (on other days). Levels of aldosterone will also be analyzed in urine collections at the time points listed in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). Blood AGT levels will be analyzed at a central laboratory by 
[CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent assay for measurement of PD effect. These biomarkers may be 
analyzed using qualified assays. Details regarding the collection, processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and storage of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory  Manual.  
Results will not be used to adjust dosing of ALN-AGT01 or guide clinical management and will not be shared with sites until after the last patient completes Month [ADDRESS_165238] -AGT01

including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and laboratory tests. Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded. 
6.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) and include 
blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. When vital signs and blood 
sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs should be performed before blood samples 
are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be measured predose in the seated position, after 
the patient has rested comfortably for approximately  10 minutes. Body temperature in degrees 
Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, or axillary methods. Heart rate will be counted for a 
full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_144674] a full 
minute and recorded in breaths per minute. Blood pressure is described in Section  6.2.  
Additional vital sign assessments, as medially indicated, may be added at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
Vital signs results will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5.2. Weight, Height, and Morphometrics 
Height and body weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded in the eCRF. Height will be measured at screening 
only. Height will be measured in centimeters. Body weight should be measured in kilograms to 
the first decimal point in patients wearing light clothing and without shoes.  
Waist circumference and waist -to-hip- ratio will also be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded on the eCRF. For waist circumference and waist -to-
hip ratio, patients should wear minimal clothing to ensure that the measuring tape is correctly 
positioned. Patients should stand erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, fe et together 
and with their weight equally divided over both legs. To perform the waist measurement, the 
lowest rib margin is first located and marked with a pen. The iliac crest is then palpated in the 
midaxillary line, and also marked. It is recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally 
midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in position around the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus. The elastic tape thus defines the 
level of the waist circumferen ce, which can then be measured by [CONTACT_144713]. Hip circumference measurement should be taken around the widest portion 
of the buttocks. Patients are asked to breathe normally, and to breathe out gently at the time of 
the measurement to prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding their breath. A 
stretch -resistant tape that provides a constant [ADDRESS_165241] centimeter and entered in the source document. Each 
measurement should be repeated twice; if the measurements are within [ADDRESS_165242] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 09 December  2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  53 average should be calculated. If the difference between the 2 measurements exceeds 1 cm, the 2 
measurements should be repeated.   
6.5.3. Physical Examination 
Full and symptom-directed physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ); if a physical examination is scheduled for a dosing visit, it should be 
conducted prior to dosing. Full physical examinations will include the examination of the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascul ar, 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and 
neurological status (see the Study Manual for further details on the assessments to be performed 
as part of the neurological evaluation). 
Symptom-directed physical examinations will be guided by [CONTACT_144714], 
or the onset of new symptoms, since the last visit. Neurologic al evaluation should be performed 
according to the Study Manual during all symptom-directed physical examinations regardless of 
whether  neurologic al symptoms  have been experienced by [CONTACT_102] .  
Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on the medical history or AE eCRF. 
6.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead ECGs reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, 
and QT interval and Fridericia -corrected QT interval will be obtained  using a local machine , as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients should be supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_165243] changed since the baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of 
the Investigator, or as per DMC advice. Recordings will be archived according to the Study 
Manual.  
6.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory. Specific 
instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. For any other 
unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug 
administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, 
or as per DMC advice, until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis 
is made to adequately explain the abnormality. Additional safety laboratories and assessments as

Amendment 3, 09 December  2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  54 indicated by [CONTACT_144715]. Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in 
Table 6 and will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).  
While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical decisions, on the day of the assessments all laboratory assessments specified in Table 6 which are performed at the clinic 
should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory. In the case of discrepant local and central 
laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day, central laboratory results will be relied upon for clinical decisions. 
Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical study center or at home by a 
trained healthcare professional. Blood samples collected for RAAS biomarkers should be collected in the  morning and in the seated/upright position ( after blood pressure measurements 
and before any assessments collected in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]). 
Spot urine collections for albumin and creatinine should be obtained in the morning. A 24 -hour 
urine collection for aldosterone, sodium, and creatinine will be performed at time points listed in 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). These 24-hour collections should be obtained within 2 
days before the ABPM associated with the same visit.  
For any safety event or laboratory abnormality, additional laboratory assessments, imaging, and consultation may be performed for clinical evaluation and/or in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor; results may be collected and should be included in the cl inical database.

6.5.6. Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and [ADDRESS_165249] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144663] (eg, events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug 
dependency or abuse). 
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest: 
• ALT or AST >3×ULN  
• Severe or serious ISRs; ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction 
at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or those that lead to 
temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of ALN-AGT01. 
An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection. “At or near” the 
injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a 
reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165250] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 09 December  2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  58 may occur with swelling or hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the 
injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like 
lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not considered an ISR. 
For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS], respectively.  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. 
Moderate:  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, 
preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money). 
Severe:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden); OR life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; OR death related to an adverse event.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity. Adverse events characterized as intermittent require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an 
AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Adverse event severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE).  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Drug  
The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by [CONTACT_144716] a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_5257]?” A “yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to 
the study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should be asked about medically relevant changes 
in the patient’s health since the last visit. The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should also be asked if the patient has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165251] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 09 December  2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  59 or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and over-the- counter). In addition 
to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, 
physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient safety.  
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by [CONTACT_144717]. Non- serious AEs will be  followed until the end of study. 
Events occurring after signing of the ICF and before study drug administration will be captured as medical history (see Section  6.1), while AEs that occur after study drug administration, and 
baseline events that worsen after study drug administration, must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by [CONTACT_144718]. SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by [CONTACT_144719], as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug- related. Each AE must be described in 
detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken, 
and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) in the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the supplemental AEs of 
Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed. Additional clinical and laboratory information may 
be collected. Refer to CRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the 
supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF.  
For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or

Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165256] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 09 December  2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  61 [IP_ADDRESS]. Overdose and Other Special Situations  Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose of study drug administered to the participant or taken by [CONTACT_144724] >2× the assigned dose during a single administration and/or ≥2 doses within ½ 
the intended dosing interval. 
The Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  
In an event of an overdose or other special situations (eg, medication error, abuse, misuse, CPC 
associated with an AE) , the Investigator should: 
• Contact [CONTACT_27909] 24 hours  
• Submit the special situations reporting form within [ADDRESS_165257] information in the Pharmacy Manual 
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities 
• Document the amount of study drug given  
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication will be considered AEs/SAEs.  
Full details of overdose and other special situations reporting instructions will be outlined in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and Biospecimen Repository  
Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144664]. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence 
will result in variations in drug effect. More generally, genetic variations may account for the well-described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with hypertension, as well as 
their responses to treatment.  
Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and patient consent, samples will be collected as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the 
application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may further eluc idate the outcomes of this 
study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or efficacy 
of ALN -AGT01. 
Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1).  In addition to the dedicated collections for optional exploratory biomarkers (urine, 
plasma, serum), aliquots from each 24-hour urine collection will be archived for potential 
exploratory investigations. These specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory. Potential 
exploratory investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progression, efficacy, or safety.  
The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety laboratory samples, PK samples, etc) that are obtained during the study. 
These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following 
the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations. After

Exploratory analysis of these biospecimens will be performed by [CONTACT_144725].  
When biobanking is permitted by [CONTACT_1295], study participants will be advised during the informed consent process of these biobanking details and the potential for exploratory investigation of their samples.  
7. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock and unblinding for the primary analysis. The plan will detail the implementation of the statistical analyses in accordance with the principle features stated in the protocol. 
7.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_165259]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg, and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sample size of 375 patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response 
relationship in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_165260] deviation 
assumptions.

Amendment 3, 09 December  2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  72 10. APPENDICES  
10.1. Measurement of Blood Pressure  
All blood pressure measurements (office, ABPM, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in the relevant user manuals .  
The appropriately sized cuff for each modality must be used for all assessments. The arm’s circumference at midpoint (halfway between the acromion and olecranon) should be determined 
at screening with a metric tape measure and used to select the appropriately sized blood pressure 
cuff/bladder for each instrument as described in the Study Manual. Unless significant weight loss or gain occurs between visits, the patient should use the same cuff/bladder size throughout the study. 
At the first Screening visit only, office blood pressure will be measured in both arms to select the 
appropriate arm to use for office blood pressure and HBPM measurements. Unless a concomitant 
condition favors the use of a specific arm, the arm with the higher office SBP should be used for 
all subsequent office blood pressure and HBPM readings. The ABPM should be measured using the patient’s nondominant arm. If the patient is ambidextrous, the same arm used for office blood pressure and HBPM readings should be used. 
ABPM  
The appropriately sized cuff should be placed on the correct arm following the instructions in the 
Study Manual. In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as rescue 
medication), ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication. All ABPM collections must be in the outpatient/ambulatory state.  ABPM recordings that are 
associated with dosing visits must be obtained in advance of the visit (within 7 days before the corresponding dosing visit) and  the results  reviewed prior to dosing. 
During the 24-hour monitoring period, patients must avoid strenuous exercise but should 
otherwise maintain their usual level of physical activity. The ABPM is programmed to take 
readings every 20 minutes during the day (6 am to 9:59 pm) and every 30 minutes during the night (10 pm to 5:59 am). While awake, the patient should hold their arm still by [CONTACT_144736] a reading. Patients must record the timing of going to sleep, waking up, 
and any oral medications taken during the ABPM, and these responses must be entered into the eCRF.  
After the monitoring period is complete, upload the ABPM data to receive a report with adequacy assessment. An ABPM will be considered adequate if (1) the number of successful 
daytime readings is ≥33, (2)  the number of successful nighttime readings is ≥11, and (3) no more 
than 3 hours are not represented (ie, 3 sections of 60 minutes where 0 valid readings were obtained) . If the ABPM recording is inadequate, the patient will be provided [ADDRESS_165280] -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 09 December  2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  73 Office blood pressure should be measured early in the visit prior to the morning dose of 
antihypertensive medication, before phlebotomy or other potentially stressful assessments. To 
minimize confounding by [CONTACT_144738], study visits should be scheduled for a consistent timeframe of the day. The use of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 
hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 
inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) should be avoided within 48 hours prior to measuring blood pressure. 
Before measuring blood pressure, confirm that there has been no exercise or use of caffeine or 
nicotine- or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e- cigarettes) with in the last [ADDRESS_165281] blood pressure measurements, ask the patient to use the bathroom before the assessment. 
All office blood pressure assessments will include both seated and standing measurements.  
Seated Office Blood Pressure Measurement:  For seat
 ed measurements, the patient should be in a 
comfortable resting position in a chair with their back supported and their feet flat on the floor. 
• Place the appropriately sized cuff on the correct arm with no clothing between the 
patient’
s arm and the cuff and with the midpoint of the bladder length positioned over 
the brachial artery (located by [CONTACT_23302]). The arm should be supported on an armrest or table with mid -cuff at heart level and the palm facing the ceiling.  
• Follow the Study Manual to initiate the automated blood pressure device’s seated measurement protocol. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by [ADDRESS_165282] 3 individual 
measurements.  
• During the device’s seated measurement protocol, the staff member should leave the 
room and the patient should remain at rest without distraction (avoid mobile phones). The following script may be used: “The blood pressure device works best when you 
are at  rest and without any distraction. If you agree, I would like to leave the room for 
the next [ADDRESS_165283], followed by [CONTACT_2902] 5 minutes of the device inflating to measure your blood pressure”.  
Standing Office Blood Pressure Measurement: A standing measurement should be obtained 
immediately after collection of the seated measurements.  
• Being careful to maintain the cuff’s position, ask the patient to stand with the cuffed arm bent s
lightly and the hand of the cuffed arm supported at heart level.  
• Using a stopwatch or watch, measure standing blood pressure 1 minute after standing 
by [CONTACT_144739]’s single measurement protocol.  
• After the standing measurement, ask the patient if they experienced dizziness or light-
headedness when standing and enter their response in the eCRF. 
If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute 
“remote visit blood pressure measurement ” may be obtained remotely by a visiting nurse or other

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  74 appropriately trained personnel who will bring an office blood pressure instrument to the 
patient’s location and follow the same procedure performed at the site. If a home visit is not 
possible, a “remote visit blood pressure measurement” should instead be obtained using the patient’s HBPM instrument under direct supervision (phone call or teleconferencing) by 
[CONTACT_144740], following the instructions detailed in the Study Manual. Results 
and the remote method used should be entered into the eCRF.  
HBPM  
Patients should measure HBPM every morning, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning oral medications.  HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. The HBPM 
measurement should be obtained in a room without distractions, seated comfortably with the 
back supported and feet flat on the floor. The patient will initiate the automated blood pressure 
program on their HBPM device. This program includes a 5- minute period of rest, followed by [ADDRESS_165285] 2 consecutive weeks (and 
with at least 3 successful readings per week) prior to randomization. Patients previously taking 
medication for hypertension must be without antihypertensives for ≥ 2 weeks prior to collecting 
these baseline HBPM measurements  (4 weeks of washout is required  for long- acting 
antihypertensive medications, such as long- acting  diuretics or CCBs) . If adequate baseline 
HBPM data (at least [ADDRESS_165286] 2 consecutive weeks) are not 
collected within the Screening period, the patient is a screen failure.  
After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at least [ADDRESS_165287]-AGT01-002

Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  6 of the study design is provided in Figure 1. Before randomization, patients will discontinue prior 
antihypertensive medications (if taking) for a Washout period of at least 4 weeks . Patients who 
complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for enrollment will 
receive ALN -AGT01 or placebo for the first 6 months of the 12-month Double-blind ( DB) 
treatment period.  
Starting at Month 3, conventional oral antihypertensives may be added per Investigator 
judgement for elevated blood pressure. Oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be temporarily 
held from Month [ADDRESS_165291]-AGT01 alone (vs placebo) at Month 6 
by [CONTACT_46674] ( ABPM ). During this 4-week period, blood pressure 
will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144760]. Patients may resume conventional oral antihypertensives at Month [ADDRESS_165292]-AGT01 open-label extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reaches Month 12 prior 
to availability of the OLE study , they may  continue their current blinded dosing in the DB 
Extension period for up to 12 additional months until the OLE study is open and then transition. 
Number of Planned Patients  
Approximately 375 patients will be enrolled in this study.  
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
This study will include adults (18 to 75 years, inclusive) with untreated hypertension or on stable 
therapy with 1 or more antihypertensive medications of the following classes: an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II-receptor blocker, renin inhibitor, calcium channel 
blocker, thiazide diuretic, and/or thiazide-like diuretic. Patients should have a daytime mean 
systolic blood pressure ( SBP) ≥135 mmHg and ≤[ADDRESS_165293]- AGT01 is a n SC administered N -acetylgalactosamine -conjugated small interfering RNA 
targeting liver -expressed messenger RNA for angiotensinogen (AGT). 
Patients randomized to receive ALN -AGT01 will be administered [ADDRESS_165294] -AGT01 beginning at Month 6.  
Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Placebo (sodium chloride 0.9% w/v for SC administration) will be administered once every [ADDRESS_165295] -AGT01 is up to 24 months. The estimated total time on 
study for each patient is up to 44 months, including up to 2 months of screening, followed by [CONTACT_25765] 24 months of treatment, and up to 18 months in the Follow-up period. 
Statistical Methods  
The planned enrollment for this study is 375 patients. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] (mean 24- hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg). 
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_165296]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg,  and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sample size of 375 
patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response 
relationship in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_165297]-AGT01 dose versus placebo with a 2 -sided 
significance level of 0.05.  
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows:  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by- treatment analyses based on the FAS will be according to the 
randomized treatment arm.  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug, grouped 
according to the treatment actually received.  
• Pharmacokinetic ( PK) Analysis Set : All patients who received at least [ADDRESS_165298] -AGT01 concentrations . 
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug and who have 
baseline and at least [ADDRESS_165299] -AGT01

linked to a triantennary N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand, which is designed to suppress 
liver production of angiotensinogen (AGT) and thereby  [CONTACT_144776].  
1.1. Study Rationale  
Study ALN- AGT01 -002 (KARDIA -1) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-
ranging, multicenter Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and 
pharmacodynamics ( PD) of ALN -AGT01, administered SC, in patients with mild -to-moderate 
hypertension. Patients will be randomized to [ADDRESS_165310] 6 months of the 12-month Double-blind (DB) period. After the first [ADDRESS_165311]-AGT01 open- label 
extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reaches Month [ADDRESS_165312] on systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 
Month 3, as assessed by [CONTACT_46674] (ABPM). Se condary and 
exploratory objectives of the study include evaluating the efficacy of ALN-AGT01 on other measures of blood pressure response and evaluating the PD effect of ALN -AGT01, including 
reduction in circulating AGT concentration. 
The full rationale for the study and design is presented in Section  3.2. 
1.2. Background  
Hypertension affects 30% to 45% of adults and is the strongest modifiable risk factor for 
cardiovascular  disease, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction.[ Olsen 2016; Williams 2018 ] 
The worldwide disease burden is profound, with a global prevalence of over 1 billion,[ Kearney 
2005; NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017] and approximately 9 million deaths attributed to hypertension annually.[ Angell 2015] 
Currently available pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144672] a minority of 
patients, due in large part to  physician inertia and patient nonadherence to  daily oral 
medication. [Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Low adherence to oral antihypertensives is 
associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes and is prevalent at all stages of disease. [Corrao 
2011; Peacock and Krousel -Wood 2017; Schulz 2016; van der Laan 2017] Thus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_144669], current rates of control are low , and the global burden 
of death and disability- adjusted life -years attributed to elevated blood pressure remains 
high.[ Forouzanfar 2017; Muntner 2020] Development of new approaches to treat hypertension 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165313] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  23 and to overcome the limitations of current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217] a key unmet need.[ Dzau and Balatbat 
2019; McClellan 2019; Services 2020] 
The Sponsor is developi[INVESTIGATOR_144647]- AGT01, a novel synthetic RNA interference ( RNAi ) 
therapeutic, for SC administration for the treatment of hypertension. RNAi is a naturally 
occurring cellular mechanism for regulation of gene expression, mediated through the binding of 
siRNA to its complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, leading to mRNA cleavage and subsequent suppression of the synthesis and levels of the target protein. ALN- AGT01 
contains an siRNA targeting AGT  mRNA, conjugated to a GalNAc-containing liga nd to facilitate 
delivery to the liver. Based on the mechanism of RNAi, ALN-AGT01 is specifically designed to reduce the hepatic synthesis of AGT protein, the first substrate in the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sole precursor of vasoactive angiotensin peptides.[ Khanna 
2017; Romero 2015] Because hepatocytes are the predominant source of circulating AGT, 
ALN-AGT01 has been developed to reduce blood pressure by [CONTACT_144742] (AngII). 
Preliminary d ata from  Part A of the ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_165314]- AGT01 -001 (hereafter referred 
to as Study 001) in patients with hypertension have shown that  single SC doses of ALN- AGT01 
lead to dose-dependent and durable reductions in circulating AGT, accompanied by [CONTACT_144685] (DBP). Reductions in AGT for up to 
[ADDRESS_165315] adverse events (AEs) have been mild or moderate in severity, and there have been no 
severe or serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study drug. There have been no clinically significant elevations in serum creatinine or serum potassium, and no patient has required 
intervention for low blood pressure. No clinically significant alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) 
elevation s have been observed in Part A  patients who received ALN-AGT01 doses as high as 
800 mg. Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported in  a minority of patients and were all mild 
and transient events that resolved without intervention. 
This Phase [ADDRESS_165316]-AGT01 across a 
range of doses (150 to 600 mg) and dose intervals (once every 3 months and once every 6 
months) to identify optimal treatment. The  consistent and prolonged PD effect of ALN -AGT01  
is expected to achieve the unique benefit of continuous 24-hour blood pressure lowering with 
infrequent SC dosing.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ALN-AGT01 is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
Clinical data available from Study [ADDRESS_165317]-AGT01, administered SC, in patients 
with mild -to-moderate hypertension. A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 1. 
Before randomization, patients will discontinue prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) for 
a Washout period of at least 4 weeks .  
DB and DB Extension Period s 
Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for enrollment will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive 1 of the following regimens over a 12-month 
DB treatment period. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by 
[CONTACT_144681] (mean 24- hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg) .  
• Placebo SC once every 3 months, with re -randomization (1:1:1:1) at Month [ADDRESS_165318] -AGT01 regimens 
• [ADDRESS_165319]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_165320]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_165321]-AGT01 SC once every 3 months 
• [ADDRESS_165322] -AGT01  to maintain the blind. 
At Month 3, conventional oral antihypertensives may be added per Investigator judgement for daytime mean SBP ≥ 135 mmHg  by [CONTACT_44117]. After Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications 
may also be added per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above 
target (target defined as office SBP <140 mmHg, home blood pressure monitoring [ HBPM ] SBP 
<135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP <135 mmHg  by [CONTACT_44117] ). Oral antihypertensives (if taking) 
will be temporarily held from Month 5 to Month 6 in appropriate patients (Month 5 office SBP <155 mmHg if taking 1 oral antihypertensive agent or office SBP <150 mmHg if taking 2 
agents) to assess the effect of ALN -AGT01 alone (vs placebo) at Month 6 by [CONTACT_44117]. During this 
4-week period, blood pressure will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144777] >170 mmHg (or if confirmed 
office SBP >160 mmHg accompanied by [CONTACT_23805]). 
Patients may be eligible to participate in an ALN -AGT01 OLE study upon completion of the 
Month 12 predose assessments. If an individual patient reaches Month 12 prior to availability of 
the OLE study, they may continue their current blinded dosing in the DB Extension period for up to 12 additional months until the OLE study is open and then transition. Once the OLE study is 
open for enrollment, eligible patients may rollover into the OLE study at Months 12, 18, or 24 
(whichever visit occurs first).  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165323] dose of study drug: 
• Patients who discontinue study drug before Month 6: Safety Follow- up visits will occur 
once every [ADDRESS_165324] patient’s Month 6 visit 
or until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline l evel, 
whichever comes later.  
• Patients who discontinue study drug after the Month 6 visit: Safety Follow- up visits will 
occur once every [ADDRESS_165325] dose of study drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline level.  
Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will be asked to complete the remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration) through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, early termination (ET) assessments should be performed. 
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 375 patients  (75 patients per group). 
The duration of treatment with ALN -AGT01 is up to [ADDRESS_165326]-AGT01 across a range of doses and 
dose intervals to identify optimal treatment regimens for study in Phase 3. 
Patients will discontinue prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) for at least 4 weeks prior 
to study drug administration. During the study, blood pressure will be monitored with both 
outpatient 24-hour ABPM and automated office blood pressure measurements 
(EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in 
the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016). The primary endpoint will be assessed by [CONTACT_144687]. In addition, 24-hour ABPM can 
assess short -term blood pressure variability and circadian patterns (including potential restoration 
of the normal nocturnal blood pressure dippi[INVESTIGATOR_144650] 21% to 35% of hypertensive 
patients). [de la Sierra 2009 ; White 1998] More frequent measurements will be collected through 
a third method, oscillometric HBPM, to assess long-term blood pressure variability and provide close safety monitoring for potential hypotension (or hypertension) while not in the clinic. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165327] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  28 As recommended by [CONTACT_144688] (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH] Principles for Clinical Evaluation of 
New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000 and EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016), the first [ADDRESS_165328] ethical standards for the treatment of pati ents with hypertension, individual 
modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator judgement to maintain blood 
pressure within target is permitted starting at Month 3 and will continue throughout the study 
(except between Month 5 and Month 6 as described in Section  3.1). Separate from these treat -to-
target modifications, any confirmed event of severe systolic hypertension (SBP ≥180 mmHg) will be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
If a patient requires treatment with a conventional oral antihypertensive before Month 6, a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and/or thiazide/thiazide- like diuretic will be added because there 
is extensive experience combining these classes with antihypertensive drugs that impact the RAAS. Additionally, their blood pressure effects are expected to washout within [ADDRESS_165329] -AGT01 at Month 6 (trough for the 
once every 6 month regimens) relative to placebo  is critical to evaluate the feasibility of once 
every 6 month dosing regimens for future study in Phase 3. Accordingly, oral antihypertensives 
(if taking) will be temporarily held from Month 5 to the Month 6 ABPM assessment. For each 
patient, this limited interruption in oral antihypertensives will be contingent upon the patient’s 
Month 5 office SBP being adequately controlled (see Table 4 ) and the Investigator’s assessment 
that interruption can be safely performed and carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144762]. Of note, a withdrawal period is a standard element in studies of oral antihypertensives that is often used to establish assay sensitivity, to demonstrate maintenance of efficacy, and to assess possible withdrawal effects (ICH E12A; Principles for Clinical Evaluation 
of New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000). Outside of research studies, antihypertensives are temporarily discontinued in clinical practice for diagnostic purposes, and interruptions up to [ADDRESS_165330] been shown to  be safe. [Beeftink 2017] In this study, the period of interruption is 
limited to [ADDRESS_165331] -AGT01. If a clinically significant blood pressure elevation (confirmed SBP >170 
mmHg; or SBP >160 mmHg accompanied by [CONTACT_23805]) occurs after the interruption of oral 
antihypertensives, Investigators will instruct the patient to promptly resume dosing with their 
existing supply of oral medication.  
After Month 6, other oral antihypertensives may be used at the discretion of the Investigator, 
following current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Because ALN -AGT01 acts on 
the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin II-receptor blocker [ARB], 
angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue agents for 
high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study. Blood pressure and pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/PD assessments will be collected through Month [ADDRESS_165332] -AGT01 for the liver is hypothesized to improve tolerability 
relative to current oral antihypertensives, [Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] the protocol’s monitoring 
plan is designed to meet the standards set by [CONTACT_144751],[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] with improvements to include the use of the newer 
oral potassium binder patiromer for treatment of potential hyperkalemia.[ Georgianos and 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165333] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  29 Agarwal 2018; Weir 2015 ] The risk of renal safety events is further mitigated in this study by [CONTACT_144778], which exclude patients who are at highest risk to have events (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 mL/min/1.73m2, baseline serum potassium >5 mEq/L, 
poorly controlled diabetes, or severely increased albuminuria) and those who may have 
decreased tolerance for renal safety events (patients with clinically significant heart failure, 
valvular heart disease, or recent hi story of cardiovascular event).  
3.3. Justification for Dose  
The doses of ALN-AGT01 in this study were selected on the basis of data from the Phase [ADDRESS_165334] an acceptable 
safety profile , and clinically significant placebo -corrected reductions in mean SBP >[ADDRESS_165335] s (ie, lowering of serum AGT) and antihypertensive responses. This is expected to enable 
development of population average dose-response relationships for PD and efficacy to guide identification of optimal treatment regimens  (dose and dose frequency) for Phase 3.  
Preliminary PK/PD modeling based on serum AGT data from Study [ADDRESS_165336]-AGT01 results in a dose-dependent lowering of serum AGT,  with maximum reductions 
predicted to be achieved as early as 1 month postdose and  significant reductions sustained for 
close to 6 months after dosing. Modeling of the relationship between serum AGT lowering and blood pressure suggests a log- linear relationship, with ≥92% reduction in serum AGT predicted 
to achieve median SBP reduction of ≥10 mmHg.  
Based on these, the once every 6 month doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg were selected to result in 
median serum AGT reductions of 81.9%, 89.4%, and 94.9%, respectively, at trough (Month 6), 
translating to median SBP reductions of 6.67 mmHg, 8.74 mmHg, and 11.6 mmHg, respectively. Thus, the selected doses will enable characterization of the dose-response relationships for serum AGT and blood pressure with the once every 6 month regimen. 
The selected doses also enable characterization of the dose-response relationships for serum 
AGT and blood pressure with once every 3 month regimens based on analysis of data from all arms  at Month 3. This will provide support for development of a once every 3 month regimen, if 
desired . To this end, 300 mg once every 3 months will be evaluated to identify any cumulative 
effects. The 300 mg once every 3 months dose is predicted to result in median serum AGT reductions of >95% at trough (Month 3), translating  to median SBP reductions of >[ADDRESS_165337] -AGT01 as an antihypertensive therapeutic that results in reduction of blood pressure by 
≥10 mmHg throughout the dosing interval with infrequent administration. 
3.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
Using the Interactive Response Technology (IRT), patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_165338] 6 months of the 12-month DB period: 
• Placebo SC once every [ADDRESS_165339] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  30 • [ADDRESS_165340]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_165341]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_165342]-AGT01 SC once every 3 months 
• [ADDRESS_165343]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
Patients initially randomized to placebo will be re -randomized 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_165344] -AGT01 regimens. 
Patients who enter the DB Extension period will continue their current blinded dosing regimen 
from the DB period. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] 
(mean 24 -hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg) . 
Each patient will be uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and patient identification number. Upon signing the informed consent form (ICF), the patient will be assigned a patient identification number by [CONTACT_82550] . The Investigator or his/her designee 
will randomize the patient in IRT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. The Investigator or his/her designee will re-randomize the patient in IRT at Month [ADDRESS_165345]-AGT01 dose groups. 
3.5. Blinding  
The Sponsor, all site personnel (except for the site pharmacist or delegate ), and patients will be 
blinded to study drug treatment through Month 6 of the 12-month DB period. After the database 
lock to support the analysis of Month 6 data is complete, the Sponsor will be unblinded to 
treatment assignment, but the site personnel (except for the site pharmacist)  and patients will 
remain blinded to treatment assignment until after  the analysis of Month 12 data is complete.  
Blinded doses of study drug will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator (see Section  5.2.2). All patients will receive the same volume and number of injections regardless of 
treatment assignment (patients receiving once every [ADDRESS_165346]- AGT01  to maintain the blind). 
Because ALN-AGT01 may be slightly  visually distinguishable from placebo, all blinded study 
drug doses will be prepared and the syringe (s) will be masked by a site pharmacist  or delegate  
prior to administration by a blinded healthcare professional. See the Pharmacy Manual for additional details.  
3.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
If the treating physician determines that the clinical management of the patient requires 
knowledge of the study drug assignment, the Investigator may break the blind, as necessary, in 
IRT. If time permits, clinical study center personnel should contact [CONTACT_144752] [ADDRESS_165347] reached the end of the study if  the patient : 
• has completed at least the Month 12 visit and enrolled in the OLE study, or 
• has completed the Safety Follow -up visits as described in Section  3.1 for patients who 
discontinue study drug or do not enroll in the OLE study.

4.3. Removal from Study Drug or Assessment  
Patients or their legal guardians are free to discontinue study drug and/or stop protocol procedural assessments, or participation in the study as a whole at any time and for any reason, without penalty to their continuing medical care. The Investigator or the Sponsor may 
discontinue study drug or stop a patient’s participation in the study at any time if this is 
considered to be in the patient’s best interest. Any discontinuation of treatment or the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144652]’s participation in the study must be fully documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and should be followed up by [CONTACT_737]. 
Discontinuation of study drug or declining procedural assessments is described in Section  4.3.1, 
while the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a patient’s participation in the study is detailed in Section  4.3.2. 
4.3.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug or Declining Procedural Assessments  
Reasons for discontinuation of study drug include any of the following: 
• Significant protocol deviation; which includes required treatment with prohibited 
medication (as defined in Section  5.5.2) per Investigator discretion 
• AE 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165357] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  35 • Non-adherence to treatment regimen  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Other reason (non- AE) 
• Or, study is terminated by [CONTACT_144745], the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor or Medical Monitor before 
discontinuing dosing in the patient. Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study 
drug dosing immediately (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for reporting and follow-up of pregnancy). A 
positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug. 
Patients who discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments should not be 
automatically removed from study. In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for 
any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments and 
study visits so that their experience is captured in the final analyses.  
If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1), including different options for follow-up and collection 
of data (eg, in person, by [CONTACT_648], by [CONTACT_2319], through family or friends, or from options not 
involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians or from review 
of medical records), including endpoints and AEs, and must document this decision in the patient’s medical records.  
If a patient discontinues dosing due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason 
must be recorded in the eCRF. Patients who discontinue study drug and remain on study may 
receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator 
judge ment, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue from study drug before Month 6 will be encouraged to remain on the 
study and complete assessments (excluding PK assessments) through Month 6. They will also be 
asked to complete S afety Follow-up visits once every [ADDRESS_165358] dose of study drug 
per the safety follow- up schedule (see Table 1)  until the last patient’s Month 6 visit or until PD 
recovery (whichever is later); see Section  3.1. 
Patients who discontinue study drug after the Month 6 visit will be asked to return for their next scheduled visit to complete end of treatment ( EOT )/ET assessments and complete S afety Follow-
up visits once every [ADDRESS_165359] dose of study drug per the safety follow-up schedule (see Table 1)  until PD recovery; see Section 3.1. 
4.3.2. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient  or Legal Guardian Stops Participation in the Study  
A patient  or their legal guardian  may stop participation in the study at any time. A patient or 
legal guardian considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144653] [ADDRESS_165360] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  36 informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and 
remain in the study to complete their study assessments through the Month [ADDRESS_165361] the Month 6 visit assessments at an earlier time ( Table 1).  
A patient considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144654] 6 visit should be informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study to complete the assessments scheduled for the EOT /ET visit and complete 
Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section  4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal 
assessments for which the patient consents.  
If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator 
is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144655]. Data 
collected from the patient can continue to be used. 
Note, in countries where the collection and processing of the patient’s personal data is based on 
consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process his/her personal data (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), as applicable, personal data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as 
appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases ) can be included 
after withdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by [CONTACT_1769].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data or Objection to 
Process Patient’s Personal Data  
Where allowed by [CONTACT_1769], the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, and 
use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the study doctor at any 
time in writing or in any other form that may be locally require d. Also, where allowed by [CONTACT_49762], the patient may object to the collection, storage, and use of his/her personal data, informing 
the study doctor at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required. In both 
cases, the Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information (including any data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samples until the time of 
withdrawal/objection) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as 
applicable,  further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study 
The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this 
is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. However, study integrity and interpretation are 
best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study  assessments and follow-up even if study 
drug is discontinued. 
Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section  8.1.6.

Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  37 [IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Reason for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation 
The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts will be made to complete and report the 
observations as thoroughly as possible. If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. 
4.3.3. Lost to Follow- Up 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_144746]. The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_144779] [for the patient] to continue in the study, and/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_144754] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s medical record.  
• Should the patient or legal guardian continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study. 
• For patients who are lost to follow-up, the Investigator can search publicly available records (where permitted and allowed by [CONTACT_1769]) to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible. 
4.3.4. Replacement of Study Patients  
No additional patients may be enrolled to mitigate the impact of patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study.  
5. TREATMENTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS  
5.1. Treatments Administered  
Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study and must not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. Study drug that has been dispensed and returned unused must not be re-dispensed.

(including but not limited to unusual clumsiness, gait abnormalities, and unexplained 
balance/coordination issues that are either absent at or worsening from the baseline) should be reported as an AE. If the treatment -emergent AE is persistent and considered related to study 
drug, specialty consultation with a neurologist should be considered. However, if such a treatment -emergent AE is serious or severe (regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of 
relatedness), the patient must be referred for neurologist consultation, and study drug dosing 
must be held until that consultation is complete. Resumption of dosing must be approved by [CONTACT_5134]. 
5.2.6. Preparation, Handling, and Storage 
Staff at each clinical study center will be responsible for preparation of ALN -AGT01 or placebo 
doses according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. No special procedures for the 
safe handling of study drug are required. 
ALN- AGT01  will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 2 to 30°C until dose 
preparation. Deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the 
Sponsor and use of ALN -AGT01  halted until authorization for its continued use has been 
provided by [CONTACT_16015], as described in the Pharmacy Manual. 
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
Instructions specific to unused study drug and additional storage will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165373]- AGT01 will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or 
destroyed at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations. 
Further instructions about drug accountability will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.3. Clinical Product Complaints  
5.3.1. Definition  
A clinical product complaint (CPC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of the investigational product and its packaging after it is released for distribution at clinical site.  
A CPC may be detected prior to use of study drug, during use, or after use. A CPC is typi[INVESTIGATOR_144677]; however, it is possible that investigational product complaints could be 
associated with an AE. Examples of a CPC include, but are not limi ted to: illegible clinical label, 
missing clinical label, damaged vial, empty vial, contamination of investigational product, and 
malfunction of syringe needle safety device. 
5.3.2. Reporting  
For product complaints, the Sponsor or its designee should be notified within [ADDRESS_165374] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  42 The following management recommendations for hypotension are provided: 
• Low blood pressure that is associated with symptoms should be evaluated at the 
clinical study site or another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144659] 24 hours. Clinical study site 
evaluation for low blood pressure should include the assessment of orthostatic blood 
pressur e.  
• The Investigator should consider downtitration or discontinuation of oral antihypertensives (if taking) if confirmed office SBP <100 mmHg or if clinical 
symptoms, such as lightheadedness or dizziness , develop coupled with a significantly 
lower SBP compared to prior visits (ie, SBP <110 mmHg).  
• Clinically significant events discovered during the course of a patient’s general 
medical care should be promptly communicated to the site and evaluated by [CONTACT_737], especially if hypotension is noted. Patients will carry Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) -approved patient cards to facilitate this physician- to-physician 
communication.  
• If hypotension is confirmed, serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured 
and any oral antihypertensive(s) previously started for hypertensive escape should be down-titrated or discontinued.  
• The frequency of blood pressure and biochemical monitoring (serum electrolytes and creatinine) should be increased during intercurrent illnesses that predispose patients to dehydration (eg, vomiting or diarrhea that persists for more than 24 hours) or when symptoms consistent with decreased effective circulating volume (eg, presyncopal 
symptoms, unexplained falls, decreased urine output) manifest, even if a patient’s 
recent blood pressure measurements have been normal.  
• Hypotension that warrants direct evaluation at the site should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours. In addition, other clinical events consistent with 
potential hypotension (eg, unexplained presyncope, syncope, or falls) should be 
communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the site being notified. 
• Management of persistent hypotension may include increased salt intake or, if unresponsive, standard treatments for orthostatic intolerance syndromes such as fludrocortisone or midodrine. 
• Low blood pressure that requires medical treatment (including intravenous fluid 
support) or other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (see above) 
should be recorded as AEs. 
5.4.2. Monitoring and Approach for Clinically Significant Blood Pressure Elevation 
In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored 
frequently with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential significant elevations. Whenever 
possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698]. The recommended interventions for potentially clinically significant blood pressure elevation are presented in Table 4.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165375] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  43 Table 4: Recommended Interventions for Potentially Clinically Significant Blood 
Pressure Elevation  
Study Period  Intervention  
Throughout Study • Whenever possible, management decisions should be based on blood 
pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698].  
• Any confirmed event of severe systolic hypertension (office SBP 
≥180 mmHg) should be appropriately treated regardless of its timing 
relative to study drug administration.  
• Because ALN -AGT01 acts on the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS 
inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue 
agents for high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study.  
• If added, oral antihypertensives must be used per their labeled instructions 
and in accordance with current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 
2018] 
Day 1 to Month 3 Intervene if clinically significant blood pressure elevation: 
• Because of the gradual onset of effects of ALN-AGT01, interventions for 
asymptomatic hypertension should be avoided in the first 6 weeks after the 
patient’s first administration of study drug.  
• After Week 6 , patients who develop office SBP >160 mmHg and increased 
>10 mmHg from their baseline office  SBP that persists for ≥24 hours on 2 
consecutive measurements or that is accompanied by [CONTACT_144699]. Severely 
symptomatic patients should be evaluated at the clinical study site or another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144659] 24 hours. 
• If persistent hypertension is confirmed (without the identification of a 
specific treatable cause) and the Investigator deems it to be a clinically significant change, treatment may be initiated at the medical discretion of the Investigator using a CCB  and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic. 
Investigators should avoid long-acting agents that may not fully washout 
between Month 5 and Month 6. 
Months 3 to 6 Treat to target blood pressure using a CCB and/ or thiazide /thiazide -like diuretic : 
• At Month 3, a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic should be added 
if the daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by [CONTACT_44117] . If the Investigator feels 
there is a compelling clinical reason to wait, the rationale for exception should be documented in the eCRF.  
• After Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per 
Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above 
target (target defined as office SBP <140 mmHg , HBPM  SBP <135 mmHg, 
or daytime  mean  SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135 mmHg). [Williams 2018 ] 
• A temporary hold of oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be performed in 
appropriate patients ( below) from Month 5 to Month 6:  
­ Month 5 office
 SBP <160 mmHg if taking no oral antihypertensive 
agents

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  44 Study Period  Intervention  
­ Month 5  office SBP <150 mmHg if taking 2 oral antihypertensive 
agents.  
• During this 4-week period, blood pressure will be carefully monitored by 
[CONTACT_144765] >170 mmHg (or if confirmed office SBP >160 mmHg 
accompanied by [CONTACT_23805])  
Month 6 to End of Study Treat to target blood pressure using Investigator’s choice of oral 
antihypertensive(s ). 
• At Month 6, prior oral antihypertensive should be restarted per Investigator 
judgement if daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by [CONTACT_44117]. 
• Oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per Investigator 
judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above target (target 
defined as office SBP <140 mmHg; HBPM  SBP <135 mmHg; daytime 
mean SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135 mmHg). [Whelton 2018 ; Williams 2018 ] 
5.4.3. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Renal Dysfunction 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of eGFR 
through the anticipated onset of initial ALN-AGT01 PD. Based upon the renal dysfunction 
associated with conventional RAAS inhibitors,[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] the following 
guidelines apply throughout the study: 
• Study drug (and additional oral antihypertensive agents, if applicable) should be prophylactically held during intercurrent illness or volume depletion 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥30% from baseline or to ≤30 mL/min/1.73m
2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, contact 
[CONTACT_1034], and look for potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction such as: 
− NSAIDs, antibiotics, or other treatments known to impair renal function 
− Recent exposure to intravenous contrast agents  
− Hypovolemia 
− Urinary infection 
− Urinary tract obstruction 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥40% from baseline or to 
≤25 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should look for potentially reversible causes of 
renal dysfunction and contact [CONTACT_144701]. Serum creatinine should be monitored at least weekly until improving. 
5.4.4. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hyperkalemia 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of serum 
electrolytes (at least monthly through the anticipated onset of ALN-AGT01 PD). The following guidelines apply for potassium elevations detected by [CONTACT_144702].[ McMurray 2016;

5.5. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Use of concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1). Concomitant medications include all 
prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the counter medications, vitamins, and minerals. Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the eCRF.

Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165379] dose of study drug. 
Occasional use of systemic NSAIDs is allowed. However, given their association with increased 
blood pressure, they should be avoided when possible and alternative analgesics (acetaminophen, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_35791]) should be considered.[ Whelton 2018] When used, the dosing of systemic 
NSAIDs should be at the lower end of the labeled range and for the shortest duration possible.  
Patients will be allowed to receive vaccines (eg, for SARS -CoV- 2) that have received health 
agency authorization (including for emergency use) by [CONTACT_144703]. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by [CONTACT_3786], except as described in Section  5.5.2. However, it is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded on the eCRF. Concomitant medication will be coded using an internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary. 
5.5.1. Oral Antihypertensive Medication   
Individual initiation and modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator 
judgement are permitted throughout the study if required to treat clinically significant blood pressure elevation (Section  5.4.2). In addition, after a patient completes the placebo-controlled 
primary endpoint at Month 3, Investigators will titrate therapy with oral antihypertensives to a target blood pressure range (office SBP <140 mmHg, HBPM SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135  mmHg ). All oral antihypertensive medication that are dosed once 
daily should be taken in the morning. 
Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured  at a central or local laboratory  
approximately 2 weeks after any antihypertensive addition or dose titration. 
5.5.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medication  
The following medications, treatments, and supplements are prohibited throughout the study 
(until the EOT  visit): 
• Conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors)  
• SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) 
• Prescription NSAIDs  
• Chronic/standing use of nonprescription NSAID s 
• Organic nitrate preparations (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, pentaerythritol)  
• Medications, herbal supplements (including Ma Huang and St. John’s wort), or other substances (such as licorice) that are associated with increases in LFT abnormalities or with blood pressure abnormalities are prohibited. This includes certain stimulants (eg, amphetamine, methylphenidate dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetam ine), MAO 
inhibitors, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709] (eg, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), diet pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (eg, phenylpropanolamine, sibutramine), and nasal decongestants (eg, phenylephrine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine, naphazoline hydrochloride). 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165380] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  47 • Medications, herbal medicines, over- the-counter medications, or supplements known 
to cause hyperkalemia are prohibited unless individually approved by [CONTACT_144749]. This includes potassium-sparing diuretics, 
potassium suppl ements, cyclo -oxygenase-[ADDRESS_165381] dose, throughout study participation, and through safety follow-up ( if applicable; see Section  3.1).  
Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include: 
• Placement of an intrauterine device.  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient). 
• Established use of oral (except low-dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation. 
• True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent 
patients must agree to use one of the above-mentioned contraceptive methods if they 
start heterosexual relationships during the study and through safety follow-up ( if 
applicable; Section  3.1). 
Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. 
Females of child -bearing potential include female patients who have experienced menarche (or 
begin menarche over the course of the study), and who are not postmenopausal or permanently 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165382] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  48 sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]). A 
postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause, confirmed by [CONTACT_144766].  
For male patients, no contraception is required. However, use by [CONTACT_144706] 
(condom) may be required in some countries, eg, [LOCATION_009], in order to comply with local requirements as described in the corresponding patient ICFs.  
Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144707] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Pregnancy testing will be 
performed before every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of the study (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.2. Alcohol Restrictions  
Patients should limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 units per day (unit: 1 glass of wine [approximately 125 mL] =1 measure of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_2120] [approximately 1 fluid ounce] =½ pi[INVESTIGATOR_43924] [approximately 284 mL]) for the duration 
of the study. Compliance with alcohol restrictions should be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144708]. 
5.7.3. Tobacco and Nicotine Restrictions  
Use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing 
tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e-cigarettes) must be avoided within [ADDRESS_165383] 1 week prior to screening 
assessments of blood pressure. Of note, this is the sodium intake recommended in the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension Guidelines for both hypertensive patients and for the general population.[ Williams 2018 ]  
On days on which samples for fasting lipid panel and glycemic assessments are collected, patients are required to fast for ≥10 hours before sample collection ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.5. Exercise  
Patients should abstain from strenuous exercise for [ADDRESS_165384] es and measurement of vital 
signs and weight (at the discretion of the Investigator). 
6.1. Screening Assessments  
An ICF that has been approved by [CONTACT_144709] (IRB)/IEC must be signed by [CONTACT_144767]. All patients 
or their legal guardians will be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF. 
Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria. Rescreening of patients is permitted with consultation of the Medical Monitor 
(see Section  6.1.2).  
Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained. Any changes to 
medical history occurring between the screening assessment and Day 1 will be updated prior to 
study drug administration. 
6.1.1. Retesting  
If in the Investigator’s judgement, the screening laboratory abnormalities are likely to be 
transient, then laboratory tests may be repeated . The Investigator’s rationale should be 
documented. Laboratory values can be retested once during screening provided that the patient 
can be evaluated for eligibility  after at least 4 weeks of washout and randomized within the 
allowed Screening period. Retesting of screening ABPM is permitted once as described in Section  6.2.1, with eligibility assessed by [CONTACT_144757] . 
6.1.2. Rescreening  
A patient who does not meet all study eligibility criteria due to a transient condition observed at 
screening (eg, prohibited medications that were subsequently discontinued) will be allowed to 
return  once for rescreening. A patient will be re-consented if rescreening occurs outside of the 
60-day screening window. In this case, all screening procedures must be repeated. 
6.2. Efficacy Assessments 
All blood pressure measurements ( ABPM, office, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in Section  10.1.  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives, a washout of at least [ADDRESS_165385] be completed prior 
to measurement of the baseline ABPM (for eligibility) and  baseline office blood pressure. The 
baseline ABPM and office blood pressure must be measured within 2 weeks before randomization. An HBPM unit will be provided during the Screening period to facilitate 
monitoring during the washout of prior oral antihypertensives (if taking) and to establish the 
HBPM baseline prior to randomization. HBPM must be collected  after at least [ADDRESS_165386] 2 consecutive weeks (at least 3 recordings per week) prior to randomization 
to establish baseline . 
ABPM placement may be performed at home by [CONTACT_144711], as detailed in the Study Manual. If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure 
assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained remotely 
using the methods described in Section 10.1. 
Recommendations for approach and monitoring of low blood pressure/hypotension and 
hypertensive escape are provided in Section  5.4.1 and Section  5.4.2, respectively. 
6.2.1. ABPM  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as rescue medication), ABPM must be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication.  
Adequacy will be assessed for all ABPMs. If the ABPM recording is inadequate, the patient will 
be provided [ADDRESS_165387]  be measured  using the automated blood pressure device provided by 
[CONTACT_144712] (prior to taking oral antihypertensives) and at approximately the same time 
each day; therefore, visits should be scheduled at approximately the same time of day, whenever 
possible. Office blood pressure must include orthostatic measurements (seated and standing).  
Exercise, caffeine, alcohol consumption, and use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products 
(including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or 
e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 minutes prior to blood pressure measurements. The use of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood 
pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, 
tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) sho uld be avoided within [ADDRESS_165388]/caffeine or 
taking morning oral medications. HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. 
The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet flat on the floor as detailed in Section  10.[ADDRESS_165389] sites will be given the option of using a wearable blood pressure sensor for 2 periods of 2 to 4 weeks  each  according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1). Wearable blood pressure assessments performed during screening should be obtained 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165390] as described in the 
Study Manual, using the opposite arm as that used for ABPM. 
6.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples for determination of AGT and RAAS biomarkers ( plasma renin concentration, 
AngI, Ang II, and aldosterone) will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1).  Blood samples collected  for AngI and AngII require special processing and will be 
assessed at sites that have appropriate resources, equipment, and reagents. Blood samples for PD 
assessments must be collected before study drug administration (on days when study drug is to be dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing (on other days). Levels of aldosterone will also be analyzed in urine collections at the time points listed in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). Blood AGT levels will be analyzed at a central laboratory by 
[CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent assay for measurement of PD effect. These biomarkers may be 
analyzed using qualified assays. Details regarding the collection, processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and storage of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory  Manual.  
Results will not be used to adjust dosing of ALN-AGT01 or guide other elements of study conduct or clinical management and will not be shared with sites until after study completion. If 
clinical circumstances arise for which such information is required to guide patient care, local 
laboratory assessments should be drawn. 
6.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for the assessment of plasma concentrations  of ALN -AGT01 
and it s primary metabolite AS(N -1)3′ ALN -AGT01 at the time points indicated in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ). A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples 
for PK analysis is in Table 2. 
Plasma concentrations of ALN -AGT01 and AS(N- 1)3′ ALN -AGT01 will be determined using a 
validated assay. Details regarding sample volumes to be collected, and the processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the study will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs, 
including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and laboratory tests. Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded. 
6.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) and include 
blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. When vital signs and blood 
sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs should be performed before blood samples 
are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be measured predose in the seated position, after 
the patient has rested comfortably for [ADDRESS_165391] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  52 recorded in beats per minute, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_144674] a full minute and recorded 
in breaths per minute. Blood pressure is described in Section  6.2.  
Additional vital sign assessments, as medially indicated, may be added at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
Vital signs results will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5.2. Weight, Height, and Morphometrics 
Height and body weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded in the eCRF. Height will be measured at screening 
only. Height will be measured in centimeters. Body weight should be measured in kilograms to the first decimal point in patients wearing light clothing and without shoes.  
Waist circumference and waist -to-hip- ratio will also be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded on the eCRF. For waist circumference and waist -to-
hip ratio, patients should wear minimal clothing to ensure that the measuring tape is correctly 
positioned. Patients should stand erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, fe et together 
and with their weight equally divided over both legs. To perform the waist measurement, the lowest rib margin is first located and marked with a pen. The iliac crest is then palpated in the midaxillary line, and also marked. It is recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally 
midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in 
position around the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus. The elastic tape thus defines the level of the waist circumferen ce, which can then be measured by [CONTACT_144713]. Hip circumference measurement should be taken around the widest portion of the buttocks. Patients are asked to breathe normally, and to breathe out gently at the time of the measurement to prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding their breath. A 
stretch -resistant tape that provides a constant [ADDRESS_165392] centimeter and entered in the source document. Each 
measurement should be repeated twice; if the measurements are within 1 cm of each other, the average should be calculated. If the difference between the 2 measurements exceeds 1 cm, the 2 measurements should be repeated.   
6.5.3. Physical Examination 
Full and symptom-directed physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ); if a physical examination is scheduled for a dosing visit, it should be 
conducted prior to dosing. Full physical examinations will include the examination of the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascul ar, 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and 
neurological status (see the Study Manual for further details on the assessments to be performed 
as part of the neurological evaluation). 
Symptom-directed physical examinations will be guided by [CONTACT_144714], 
or the onset of new symptoms, since the last visit. Neurologic al evaluation should be performed 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165393] been experienced by [CONTACT_102] .  
Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on the medical history or AE eCRF. 
6.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead ECGs reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, 
and QT interval and Fridericia- corrected QT interval will be obtained  using a local machine , as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients should be supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_165394] changed since the baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These 
assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of 
the Investigator, or as per DMC advice. Recordings will be archived according to the Study Manual.  
6.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory. Specific instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. For any other 
unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug 
administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, 
or as per DMC advice, until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately explain the abnormality. Additional safety laboratories and assessments as 
indicated by [CONTACT_144715]. Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in 
Table 6 and will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).  
While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical decisions, on the day of the 
assessments all laboratory assessments specified in Table 6 which are performed at the clinic 
should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory. In the case of discrepant local and central laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day, central laboratory results will be relied upon for clinical decisions. 
Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical study center or at home by a 
trained healthcare professional. Blood samples collected for RAAS biomarkers should be 
collected in the  morning and in the seated/upright position ( after blood pressure measurements 
and before any assessments collected in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]). 
Spot urine collections for albumin and creatinine should be obtained in the morning. A [ADDRESS_165395] -AGT01

6.5.6. Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and [ADDRESS_165399] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144663] (eg, events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug 
dependency or abuse).  
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest: 
• ALT or AST >3×ULN  
• Severe or serious ISRs; ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction 
at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or those that lead to 
temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of ALN-AGT01. 
An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection. “At or near” the injection site 
includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift 
slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as may occur with swelling or 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165400] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  58 hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other 
distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not 
considered an ISR. 
For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS], respectively.  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated. 
Moderate:  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, 
preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money). 
Severe:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden); OR life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; OR death related to an adverse event.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity. Adverse events characterized as intermittent require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an 
AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Adverse event severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE).  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Drug  
The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by [CONTACT_144716] a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_5257]?” A “yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to 
the study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should be asked about medically relevant changes 
in the patient’s health since the last visit. The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should also be asked if the patient has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165401] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  59 or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and over-the- counter). In addition 
to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, 
physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient safety.  
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by [CONTACT_144717]. Non- serious AEs will be  followed until the end of study. 
Events occurring after signing of the ICF and before study drug administration will be captured as medical history (see Section  6.1), while AEs that occur after study drug administration, and 
baseline events that worsen after study drug administration, must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by [CONTACT_144718]. SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by [CONTACT_144719], as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug- related. Each AE must be described in 
detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken, 
and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) in the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the supplemental AEs of 
Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed. Additional clinical and laboratory information may 
be collected. Refer to CRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the 
supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF.  
For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or 
Symptoms eCRF, recording additional information regarding each injection site reaction that is 
entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom(s), injection site location, follow-up actions taken, etc). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the Sponsor or its designee 
should be notified within 24 hours using the appropriate eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737]. Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_165402] the following information: 
• Patient’s study number 
• Description and date of onset of the event 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165403] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  60 • Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug, and 
• Investigator/site information  
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. Within [ADDRESS_165404] information provided in the Study Manual. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by [CONTACT_144720]/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE. These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should 
be recorded. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by [CONTACT_144768]. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by [CONTACT_144722].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the 
Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electronic 
system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the IRB/IEC per their 
institutional policy by [CONTACT_9304] (or Sponsor designee) according to country requirements. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_16211]/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through safety follow-up (Section 3.1), the 
Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_165405] dose of study drug. 
The pregnancy should be followed by [CONTACT_144723]. At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165406] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  61 [IP_ADDRESS]. Overdose and Other Special Situations  Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose of study drug administered to the participant or taken by [CONTACT_144724] >2× the assigned dose during a single administration and/or ≥2 doses within ½ 
the intended dosing interval. 
The Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  
In an event of an overdose or other special situations (eg, medication error, abuse, misuse, CPC 
associated with an AE) , the Investigator should: 
• Contact [CONTACT_27909] 24 hours  
• Submit the special situations reporting form within [ADDRESS_165407] information in the Pharmacy Manual 
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities 
• Document the amount of study drug given  
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication will be considered AEs/SAEs.  
Full details of overdose and other special situations reporting instructions will be outlined in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and Biospecimen Repository  
Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144664]. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence 
will result in variations in drug effect. More generally, genetic variations may account for the well-described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with hypertension, as well as 
their responses to treatment.  
Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and patient consent, samples will be collected as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the 
application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may further eluc idate the outcomes of this 
study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or efficacy 
of ALN -AGT01. 
Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1).  In addition to the dedicated collections for optional exploratory biomarkers (urine, 
plasma, serum), aliquots from each 24-hour urine collection will be archived for potential 
exploratory investigations. These specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory. Potential 
exploratory investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progression, efficacy, or safety.  
The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety laboratory samples, PK samples, etc) that are obtained during the study. 
These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following 
the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations. After

Exploratory analysis of these biospecimens will be performed by [CONTACT_144725].  
When biobanking is permitted by [CONTACT_1295], study participants will be advised during the informed consent process of these biobanking details and the potential for exploratory investigation of their samples.  
7. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock and unblinding for the primary analysis. The plan will detail the implementation of the statistical analyses in accordance with the principle features stated in the protocol. 
7.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_165409]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg, and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sample size of 375 patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response 
relationship in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_165410] deviation 
assumptions.

The statistical and analytical plans presented below are brief summaries of planned analyses. 
More complete plans will be detailed in the SAP. Changes to the methods described in the final 
SAP will be described and justified as needed in the clinical study report. For information on study endpoints, see Section  2. 
7.2.1. Populations to be Analyzed 
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows: 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165412] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  63 • Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by- treatment analyses based on the FAS will be according to the 
randomized treatment arm.  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug, grouped 
according to the treatment actually received.  
• PK Analysis Set : All patients who received at least [ADDRESS_165413]- AGT01 concentrations . 
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug and who have 
baseline and at least [ADDRESS_165414]-AGT01 doses and placebo will be tested using a multiple comparison– modeling (MCP Mod) approach.[ Bretz 2005 ] The presence of a dose- response trend will be initially tested 
against a set of prespecified dose- response models at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05, 
adjusted for multiplicity (the MCP step). Several candidate models will be prespecified in the 
SAP. Then, the dose-response curves will be further estimated (the modeling step) based on the 
‘best’ fitted dose response model. Furthermore, each ALN-AGT01 dose group will be compared 
against placebo using Dunnett’s Test.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165415]. Descriptive statistics for observed levels 
and the relative change from baseline for all measured biomarkers will be presented for each of 
the postdose time points. 
Statistical comparison of the biomarker levels (absolute and/or change from baseline) across 
treatment groups may be explored. Details of the analysis will be specified in the SAP.  
Population PK/PD analysis may be conducted to evaluate the dose-response relationships for PD 
lowering after ALN -AGT01 treatment. Additionally, the relationship between lowering of serum 
AGT and blood pressure may be explored within a modeling framework. If conducted, these analyses will be described in a pharmacometrics analysis plan and results will be presented in a separate report.  
7.2.7. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Plasma concentrations of ALN -AGT01 and its metabolite AS(N -1)3′ ALN -AGT01 will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Population PK analysis may be conducted on the PK data from this study. If conducted, the 
analysis methods will be described in a pharmacometrics analysis plan and results will be 
presented in a separate report.  
7.2.8. Safety Analyses 
The primary parameter is the frequency of treatment -emergent AEs (hereafter referred to simply 
as AEs). Safety parameters also include vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory assessments and physical exams. Extent of exposure will be summarized.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary. Results will be tabulated by [CONTACT_144727] (PT).

Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  71 10. APPENDICES  
10.1. Measurement of Blood Pressure  
All blood pressure measurements (office, ABPM, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in the relevant user manuals .  
The appropriately sized cuff for each modality must be used for all assessments. The arm’s circumference at midpoint (halfway between the acromion and olecranon) should be determined 
at screening with a metric tape measure and used to select the appropriat ely sized blood pressure 
cuff/bladder for each instrument as described in the Study Manual. Unless significant weight loss 
or gain occurs between visits, the patient should use the same cuff/bladder size throughout the study. 
At the first Screening visit only, office blood pressure will be measured in both arms to select the 
appropriate arm to use for office blood pressure and HBPM measurements. Unless a concomitant 
condition favors the use of a specific arm, the arm with the higher office SBP should be used for 
all subsequent office blood pressure and HBPM readings. The ABPM should be measured using the patient’s nondominant arm. If the patient is ambidextrous, the same arm used for office blood pressure and HBPM readings should be used. 
ABPM  
The appropriately sized cuff should be placed on the correct arm following the instructions in the 
Study Manual. In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as rescue 
medication), ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication. All ABPM collections must be in the outpatient/ambulatory state.  ABPM recordings that are 
associated with dosing visits must be obtained in advance of the visit (within 7 days before the corresponding dosing visit) and  the res ults reviewed prior to dosing. 
During the 24-hour monitoring period, patients must avoid strenuous exercise but should 
otherwise maintain their usual level of physical activity. The ABPM is programmed to take 
readings every 20 minutes during the day (6 am to 9:59 pm) and every 30 minutes during the night (10 pm to 5:59 am). While awake, the patient should hold their arm still by [CONTACT_144736] a reading. Patients must record the timing of going to sleep, waking up, 
and any oral medications taken during the ABPM, and these responses must be entered into the eCRF.  
After the monitoring period is complete, upload the ABPM data to receive a report with adequacy assessment. An ABPM will be considered adequate if (1) the number of successful 
daytime readings is ≥33, (2)  the number of successful nighttime readings is ≥11, and (3) no more 
than 3 hours are not represented (ie, 3 sections of 60 minutes where 0 valid readings were obtained) . If the ABPM recording is inadequate, the patient will be provided [ADDRESS_165427] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  72 Office blood pressure should be measured early in the visit, before phlebotomy or other 
potentially stressful assessments. To minimize confounding by [CONTACT_144738], study visits 
should be scheduled for a consistent timeframe of the day. The use of inhaled short- acting beta 
agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. 
The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) 
should be avoided within 48 hours prior to measuring blood pressure. 
Before measuring blood pressure, confirm that there has been no exercise or use of caffeine or 
nicotine- or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, 
cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e- cigarettes) with in the last [ADDRESS_165428] blood pressure measurements, ask the patient to use the bathroom before the assessment. 
All office blood pressure assessments will include both seated and standing measurements.  
Seated Office Blood Pressure Measurement:  For seat
 ed measurements, the patient should be in a 
comfortable resting position in a chair with their back supported and their feet flat on the floor. 
• Place the appropriately sized cuff on the correct arm with no clothing between the 
patient’
s arm and the cuff and with the midpoint of the bladder length positioned over 
the brachial artery (located by [CONTACT_23302]). The arm should be supported on an armrest or table with mid -cuff at heart level and the palm facing the ceiling.  
• Follow the Study Manual to initiate the automated blood pressure device’s seated 
measurement protocol. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by 
[ADDRESS_165429] 3 individual 
measurements.  
• During the device’s seated measurement protocol, the staff member should leave the room and the patient should remain at rest without distraction (avoid mobile phones). The following script may be used: “The blood pressure device works best when you are at  rest and without any distraction. If you agree, I would like to leave the room for 
the next [ADDRESS_165430], followed by [CONTACT_2902] 5 minutes of the device inflating to measure your blood pressure”.  
Standing Office Blood Pressure Measurement: A standing measurement should be obtained 
immediately after collection of the seated measurements.  
• Being careful to maintain the cuff’s position, ask the patient to stand with the cuffed arm bent s
lightly and the hand of the cuffed arm supported at heart level.  
• Using a stopwatch or watch, measure standing blood pressure 1 minute after standing by [CONTACT_144739]’s single measurement protocol.  
• After the standing measurement, ask the patient if they experienced dizziness or light-headedness when standing and enter their response in the eCRF. 
If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement ” may be obtained remotely by a visiting nurse or other 
appropriately trained personnel who will bring an office blood pressure instrument to the 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165431] -AGT01  
Amendment 2, 09 June 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  73 patient’s location and follow the same procedure performed at the site. If a home visit is not 
possible, a “remote visit blood pressure measurement” should instead be obtained using the 
patient’s HBPM instrument under direct supervision (phone call or teleconferencing) by [CONTACT_144740], following the instructions detailed in the Study Manual. Results and the remote method used should be entered into the eCRF. 
HBPM  
Patients should measure HBPM every morning, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning 
oral medications.  HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. The HBPM 
measurement should be obtained in a room without distractions, seated comfortably with the 
back supported and feet flat on the floor. The patient will initiate the automated blood pressure 
program on their HBPM device. This program includes a 5- minute period of rest, followed by [ADDRESS_165432] 2 consecutive weeks (and 
with at least 3 successful readings per week) prior to randomization. Patients previously taking medication for hypertension must be without antihypertensives for ≥4 weeks prior to collecting 
these baseline HBPM measurements.  If adequate baseline HBPM data (at least [ADDRESS_165433] 2 consecutive weeks) are not collected within the Screening period, 
the patient is a screen failure.  
After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at least [ADDRESS_165434]-AGT01-002

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  3 INVESTIGATOR’S AGREEMENT  
 
I have read the ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165437] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  6 of the study design is provided in Figure 1. Before randomization, patients will discontinue prior 
antihypertensive medications (if taking) for a Washout period of at least 4 weeks . Patients who 
complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for enrollment will 
receive ALN -AGT01 or placebo for the first 6 months of the 12-month Double-blind ( DB) 
treatment period.  
Starting at Month 3, conventional oral antihypertensives may be added per Investigator 
judgement for elevated blood pressure. Oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be temporarily 
held from Month [ADDRESS_165438]-AGT01 alone (vs placebo) at Month 6 
by [CONTACT_46674] ( ABPM ). During this 4-week period, blood pressure 
will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144760]. Patients may resume conventional oral antihypertensives at Month [ADDRESS_165439]-AGT01 open-label extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reaches Month 12 prior 
to availability of the OLE study , they may  continue their current blinded dosing in the DB 
Extension period for up to 12 additional months until the OLE study is open and then transition. 
Number of Planned Patients  
Approximately 375 patients will be enrolled in this study.  
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
This study will include adults (18 to 75 years, inclusive) with untreated hypertension or on stable 
therapy with 1 or more antihypertensive medications of the following classes: an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II-receptor blocker, renin inhibitor, calcium channel 
blocker, thiazide diuretic, and/or thiazide-like diuretic. Patients should have a daytime  mean 
systolic blood pressure ( SBP) ≥135 mmHg and ≤[ADDRESS_165440]- AGT01 is a n SC administered N -acetylgalactosamine -conjugated small interfering RNA 
targeting liver -expressed messenger RNA for angiotensinogen (AGT). 
Patients randomized to receive ALN -AGT01 will be administered [ADDRESS_165441] -AGT01 beginning at Month 6.  
Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Placebo (sodium chloride 0.9% w/v for SC administration) will be administered once every [ADDRESS_165442] -AGT01 is up to 24 months. The estimated total time on 
study for each patient is up to 44 months, including up to 2 months of screening, followed by [CONTACT_25765] 24 months of treatment, and up to 18 months in the Follow-up period. 
Statistical Methods  
The planned enrollment for this study is 375 patients. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] (mean 24- hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg). 
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_165443]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg,  and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sample size of 375 
patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response 
relationship in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_165444]-AGT01 dose versus placebo with a 2 -sided 
significance level of 0.05.  
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows:  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by- treatment analyses based on the FAS will be according to the 
randomized treatment arm.  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug, grouped 
according to the treatment actually received.  
• Pharmacokinetic ( PK) Analysis Set : All patients who received at least [ADDRESS_165445] -AGT01 concentrations . 
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug and who have 
baseline and at least [ADDRESS_165446] -AGT01

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Sponsor) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_144647]- AGT01, a  subcutaneously (SC) 
administered  investigational agent comprised of a synthetic small interfering (siRNA) covalently 
linked to a triantennary N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand, which is designed to suppress 
liver production of angiotensinogen (AGT) and thereby  [CONTACT_144776].  
1.1. Study Rationale  
Study ALN- AGT01 -002 (KARDIA -1) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-
ranging, multicenter Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and 
pharmacodynamics ( PD) of ALN -AGT01, administered SC, in patients with mild -to-moderate 
hypertension. Patients will be randomized to [ADDRESS_165457] 6 months of the 12-month Double-blind (DB) period. After the first [ADDRESS_165458]-AGT01 open- label 
extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reaches Month [ADDRESS_165459] on systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 
Month 3, as assessed by [CONTACT_46674] (ABPM). Se condary and 
exploratory objectives of the study include evaluating the efficacy of ALN-AGT01 on other measures of blood pressure response and evaluating the PD effect of ALN -AGT01, including 
reduction in circulating AGT concentration. 
The full rationale for the study and design is presented in Section  3.2. 
1.2. Background  
Hypertension affects 30% to 45% of adults and is the strongest modifiable risk factor for 
cardiovascular  disease, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction.[ Olsen 2016; Williams 2018 ] 
The worldwide disease burden is profound, with a global prevalence of over 1 billion,[ Kearney 
2005; NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017] and approximately 9 million deaths attributed to hypertension annually.[ Angell 2015] 
Currently available pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144672] a minority of 
patients, due in large part to  physician inertia and patient nonadherence to  daily oral 
medication. [Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Low adherence to oral antihypertensives is 
associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes and is prevalent at all stages of disease. [Corrao 
2011; Peacock and Krousel -Wood 2017; Schulz 2016; van der Laan 2017] Thus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_144669], current rates of control are low , and the global burden 
of death and disability- adjusted life -years attributed to elevated blood pressure remains 
high.[ Forouzanfar 2017; Muntner 2020] Development of new approaches to treat hypertension 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165460] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  22 and to overcome the limitations of current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217] a key unmet need.[ Dzau and Balatbat 
2019; McClellan 2019; Services 2020] 
The Sponsor is developi[INVESTIGATOR_144647]- AGT01, a novel synthetic RNA interference ( RNAi ) 
therapeutic, for SC administration for the treatment of hypertension. RNAi is a naturally 
occurring cellular mechanism for regulation of gene expression, mediated through the binding of 
siRNA to its complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, leading to mRNA cleavage and subsequent suppression of the synthesis and levels of the target protein. ALN- AGT01 
contains an siRNA targeting AGT  mRNA, conjugated to a GalNAc-containing liga nd to facilitate 
delivery to the liver. Based on the mechanism of RNAi, ALN-AGT01 is specifically designed to reduce the hepatic synthesis of AGT protein, the first substrate in the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sole precursor of vasoactive angiotensin peptides.[ Khanna 
2017; Romero 2015] Because hepatocytes are the predominant source of circulating AGT, 
ALN-AGT01 has been developed to reduce blood pressure by [CONTACT_144742] (AngII). 
Preliminary d ata from  Part A of the ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_165461]- AGT01 -001 (hereafter referred 
to as Study 001) in patients with hypertension have shown that  single SC doses of ALN- AGT01 
lead to dose-dependent and durable reductions in circulating AGT, accompanied by [CONTACT_144685] (DBP). Reductions in AGT for up to 
[ADDRESS_165462] adverse events (AEs) have been mild or moderate in severity, and there have been no 
severe or serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study drug. There have been no clinically significant elevations in serum creatinine or serum potassium, and no patient has required 
intervention for low blood pressure. No clinically significant alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) 
elevation s have been observed in Part A  patients who received ALN-AGT01 doses as high as 
800 mg. Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported in  a minority of patients and were all mild 
and transient events that resolved without intervention. 
This Phase [ADDRESS_165463]-AGT01 across a 
range of doses (150 to 600 mg) and dose intervals (once every 3 months and once every 6 
months) to identify optimal treatment. The  consistent and prolonged PD effect of ALN -AGT01  
is expected to achieve the unique benefit of continuous 24-hour blood pressure lowering with 
infrequent SC dosing.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ALN-AGT01 is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
Clinical data available from Study [ADDRESS_165464]-AGT01, administered SC, in patients 
with mild -to-moderate hypertension. A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 1. 
Before randomization, patients will discontinue prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) for 
a Washout period of at least 4 weeks .  
DB and DB Extension Period s 
Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for enrollment will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive 1 of the following regimens over a 12-month 
DB treatment period. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by 
[CONTACT_144681] (mean 24- hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg) .  
• Placebo SC once every 3 months, with re -randomization (1:1:1:1) at Month [ADDRESS_165465] -AGT01 regimens 
• [ADDRESS_165466]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_165467]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_165468]-AGT01 SC once every 3 months 
• [ADDRESS_165469] -AGT01  to maintain the blind. 
At Month 3, conventional oral antihypertensives may be added per Investigator judgement for daytime mean SBP ≥ 135 mmHg  by [CONTACT_44117]. After Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications 
may also be added per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above 
target (target defined as office SBP <140 mmHg, home blood pressure monitoring [ HBPM ] SBP 
<135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP <135 mmHg  by [CONTACT_44117] ). Oral antihypertensives (if taking) 
will be temporarily held from Month 5 to Month 6 in appropriate patients (Month 5 office SBP <155 mmHg if taking 1 oral antihypertensive agent or office SBP <150 mmHg if taking 2 
agents) to assess the effect of ALN -AGT01 alone (vs placebo) at Month 6 by [CONTACT_44117]. During this 
4-week period, blood pressure will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144777] >170 mmHg (or if confirmed 
office SBP >160 mmHg accompanied by [CONTACT_23805]). 
Patients may be eligible to participate in an ALN -AGT01 OLE study upon completion of the 
Month 12 predose assessments. If an individual patient reaches Month 12 prior to availability of 
the OLE study, they may continue their current blinded dosing in the DB Extension period for up to 12 additional months until the OLE study is open and then transition. Once the OLE study is 
open for enrollment, eligible patients may rollover into the OLE study at Months 12, 18, or 24 
(whichever visit occurs first).  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165470] dose of study drug: 
• Patients who discontinue study drug before Month 6: Safety Follow- up visits will occur 
once every [ADDRESS_165471] patient’s Month 6 visit 
or until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline l evel, 
whichever comes later.  
• Patients who discontinue study drug after the Month 6 visit: Safety Follow- up visits will 
occur once every [ADDRESS_165472] dose of study drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline level.  
Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will be asked to complete the remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration) through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, early termination (ET) assessments should be performed. 
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 375 patients  (75 patients per group). 
The duration of treatment with ALN -AGT01 is up to [ADDRESS_165473]-AGT01 across a range of doses and 
dose intervals to identify optimal treatment regimens for study in Phase 3. 
Patients will discontinue prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) for at least 4 weeks prior 
to study drug administration. During the study, blood pressure will be monitored with both 
outpatient 24-hour ABPM and automated office blood pressure measurements 
(EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in 
the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016). The primary endpoint will be assessed by [CONTACT_144687]. In addition, 24-hour ABPM can 
assess short -term blood pressure variability and circadian patterns (including potential restoration 
of the normal nocturnal blood pressure dippi[INVESTIGATOR_144650] 21% to 35% of hypertensive 
patients). [de la Sierra 2009 ; White 1998] More frequent measurements will be collected through 
a third method, oscillometric HBPM, to assess long-term blood pressure variability and provide close safety monitoring for potential hypotension (or hypertension) while not in the clinic. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165474] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  27 As recommended by [CONTACT_144688] (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH] Principles for Clinical Evaluation of 
New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000 and EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016), the first [ADDRESS_165475] ethical standards for the treatment of pati ents with hypertension, individual 
modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator judgement to maintain blood 
pressure within target is permitted starting at Month 3 and will continue throughout the study 
(except between Month 5 and Month 6 as described in Section  3.1). Separate from these treat -to-
target modifications, any confirmed event of severe systolic hypertension (SBP ≥180 mmHg) will be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
If a patient requires treatment with a conventional oral antihypertensive before Month 6, a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and/or thiazide/thiazide- like diuretic will be added because there 
is extensive experience combining these classes with antihypertensive drugs that impact the RAAS. Additionally, their blood pressure effects are expected to washout within [ADDRESS_165476] -AGT01 at Month 6 (trough for the 
once every 6 month regimens) relative to placebo  is critical to evaluate the feasibility of once 
every 6 month dosing regimens for future study in Phase 3. Accordingly, oral antihypertensives 
(if taking) will be temporarily held from Month 5 to the Month 6 ABPM assessment. For each 
patient, this limited interruption in oral antihypertensives will be contingent upon the patient’s 
Month 5 office SBP being adequately controlled (see Table 4 ) and the Investigator’s assessment 
that interruption can be safely performed and carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144762]. Of note, a withdrawal period is a standard element in studies of oral antihypertensives that is often used to establish assay sensitivity, to demonstrate maintenance of efficacy, and to assess possible withdrawal effects (ICH E12A; Principles for Clinical Evaluation 
of New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000). Outside of research studies, antihypertensives are temporarily discontinued in clinical practice for diagnostic purposes, and interruptions up to [ADDRESS_165477] been shown to  be safe. [Beeftink 2017] In this study, the period of interruption is 
limited to [ADDRESS_165478] -AGT01. If a clinically significant blood pressure elevation (confirmed SBP >170 
mmHg; or SBP >160 mmHg accompanied by [CONTACT_23805]) occurs after the interruption of oral 
antihypertensives, Investigators will instruct the patient to promptly resume dosing with their 
existing supply of oral medication.  
After Month 6, other oral antihypertensives may be used at the discretion of the Investigator, 
following current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Because ALN -AGT01 acts on 
the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin II-receptor blocker [ARB], 
angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue agents for 
high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study. Blood pressure and pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/PD assessments will be collected through Month [ADDRESS_165479] -AGT01 for the liver is hypothesized to improve tolerability 
relative to current oral antihypertensives, [Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] the protocol’s monitoring 
plan is designed to meet the standards set by [CONTACT_144751],[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] with improvements to include the use of the newer 
oral potassium binder patiromer for treatment of potential hyperkalemia.[ Georgianos and 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165480] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  28 Agarwal 2018; Weir 2015 ] The risk of renal safety events is further mitigated in this study by [CONTACT_144778], which exclude patients who are at highest risk to have events (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 mL/min/1.73m2, baseline serum potassium >5 mEq/L, 
poorly controlled diabetes, or severely increased albuminuria) and those who may have 
decreased tolerance for renal safety events (patients with clinically significant heart failure, 
valvular heart disease, or recent hi story of cardiovascular event).  
3.3. Justification for Dose  
The doses of ALN-AGT01 in this study were selected on the basis of data from the Phase [ADDRESS_165481] an acceptable 
safety profile , and clinically significant placebo -corrected reductions in mean SBP >[ADDRESS_165482] s (ie, lowering of serum AGT) and antihypertensive responses. This is expected to enable 
development of population average dose-response relationships for PD and efficacy to guide identification of optimal treatment regimens  (dose and dose frequency) for Phase 3.  
Preliminary PK/PD modeling based on serum AGT data from Study [ADDRESS_165483]-AGT01 results in a dose-dependent lowering of serum AGT,  with maximum reductions 
predicted to be achieved as early as 1 month postdose and  significant reductions sustained for 
close to 6 months after dosing. Modeling of the relationship between serum AGT lowering and blood pressure suggests a log- linear relationship, with ≥92% reduction in serum AGT predicted 
to achieve median SBP reduction of ≥10 mmHg.  
Based on these, the once every 6 month doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg were selected to result in 
median serum AGT reductions of 81.9%, 89.4%, and 94.9%, respectively, at trough (Month 6), 
translating to median SBP reductions of 6.67 mmHg, 8.74 mmHg, and 11.6 mmHg, respectively. Thus, the selected doses will enable characterization of the dose-response relationships for serum AGT and blood pressure with the once every 6 month regimen. 
The selected doses also enable characterization of the dose-response relationships for serum 
AGT and blood pressure with once every 3 month regimens based on analysis of data from all arms  at Month 3. This will provide support for development of a once every 3 month regimen, if 
desired . To this end, 300 mg once every 3 months will be evaluated to identify any cumulative 
effects. The 300 mg once every 3 months dose is predicted to result in median serum AGT reductions of >95% at trough (Month 3), translating to median SBP reductions of >[ADDRESS_165484] -AGT01 as an antihypertensive therapeutic that results in reduction of blood pressure by 
≥10 mmHg throughout the dosing interval with infrequent administration. 
3.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
Using the Interactive Response Technology (IRT), patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_165485] 6 months of the 12-month DB period: 
• Placebo SC once every [ADDRESS_165486] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  29 • [ADDRESS_165487]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_165488]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_165489]-AGT01 SC once every 3 months 
• [ADDRESS_165490]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
Patients initially randomized to placebo will be re -randomized 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_165491] -AGT01 regimens. 
Patients who enter the DB Extension period will continue their current blinded dosing regimen 
from the DB period. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] 
(mean 24 -hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg) . 
Each patient will be uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and patient identification number. Upon signing the informed consent form (ICF), the patient will be assigned a patient identification number by [CONTACT_82550] . The Investigator or his/her designee 
will randomize the patient in IRT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. The Investigator or his/her designee will re-randomize the patient in IRT at Month [ADDRESS_165492]-AGT01 dose groups. 
3.5. Blinding  
The Sponsor, all site personnel (except for the site pharmacist or delegate ), and patients will be 
blinded to study drug treatment through Month 6 of the 12-month DB period. After the database 
lock to support the analysis of Month 6 data is complete, the Sponsor will be unblinded to 
treatment assignment, but the site personnel (except for the site pharmacist)  and patients will 
remain blinded to treatment assignment until after  the analysis of Month 12 data is complete.  
Blinded doses of study drug will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator (see Section  5.2.2). All patients will receive the same volume and number of injections regardless of 
treatment assignment (patients receiving once every [ADDRESS_165493]- AGT01  to maintain the blind). 
Because ALN-AGT01 may be slightly  visually distinguishable from placebo, all blinded study 
drug doses will be prepared and the syringe (s) will be masked by a site pharmacist  or delegate  
prior to administration by a blinded healthcare professional. See the Pharmacy Manual for additional details.  
3.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
If the treating physician determines that the clinical management of the patient requires 
knowledge of the study drug assignment, the Investigator may break the blind, as necessary, in 
IRT. If time permits, clinical study center personnel should contact [CONTACT_144752] [ADDRESS_165494] reached the end of the study if  the patient : 
• has completed at least the Month 12 visit and enrolled in the OLE study, or 
• has completed the Safety Follow -up visits as described in Section 3.1 for patients who 
discontinue study drug or do not enroll in the OLE study. 
A definition of the end of the overall study is provided in Section  8.1.5.

4.3. Removal from Study Drug or Assessment  
Patients or their legal guardians are free to discontinue study drug and/or stop protocol procedural assessments, or participation in the study as a whole at any time and for any reason, without penalty to their continuing medical care. The Investigator or the Sponsor may 
discontinue study drug or stop a patient’s participation in the study at any time if this is 
considered to be in the patient’s best interest. Any discontinuation of treatment or the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144652]’s participation in the study must be fully documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and should be followed up by [CONTACT_737]. 
Discontinuation of study drug or declining procedural assessments is described in Section  4.3.1, 
while the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a patient’s participation in the study is detailed in Section  4.3.2. 
4.3.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug or Declining Procedural Assessments  
Reasons for discontinuation of study drug include any of the following: 
• Significant protocol deviation; which includes required treatment with prohibited 
medication (as defined in Section  5.5.2) per Investigator discretion 
• AE 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165504] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  34 • Non-adherence to treatment regimen  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Other reason (non- AE) 
• Or, study is terminated by [CONTACT_144745], the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor or Medical Monitor before 
discontinuing dosing in the patient. Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study 
drug dosing immediately (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for reporting and follow-up of pregnancy). A 
positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug. 
Patients who discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments should not be 
automatically removed from study. In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for 
any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments and 
study visits so that their experience is captured in the final analyses.  
If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1), including different options for follow-up and collection 
of data (eg, in person, by [CONTACT_648], by [CONTACT_2319], through family or friends, or from options not 
involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians or from review 
of medical records), including endpoints and AEs, and must document this decision in the patient’s medical records.  
If a patient discontinues dosing due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason 
must be recorded in the eCRF. Patients who discontinue study drug and remain on study may 
receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator 
judge ment, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue from study drug before Month 6 will be encouraged to remain on the 
study and complete assessments (excluding PK assessments) through Month 6. They will also be 
asked to complete S afety Follow-up visits once every [ADDRESS_165505] dose of study drug 
per the safety follow- up schedule (see Table 1)  until the last patient’s Month 6 visit or until PD 
recovery (whichever is later); see Section  3.1. 
Patients who discontinue study drug after the Month 6 visit will be asked to return for their next scheduled visit to complete end of treatment ( EOT )/ET assessments and complete S afety Follow-
up visits once every [ADDRESS_165506] dose of study drug per the safety follow-up schedule (see Table 1)  until PD recovery; see Section 3.1. 
4.3.2. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient  or Legal Guardian Stops Participation in the Study  
A patient  or their legal guardian  may stop participation in the study at any time. A patient or 
legal guardian considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144653] [ADDRESS_165507] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  35 informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and 
remain in the study to complete their study assessments through the Month [ADDRESS_165508] the Month 6 visit assessments at an earlier time ( Table 1).  
A patient considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144654] 6 visit should be informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study to complete the assessments scheduled for the EOT /ET visit and complete 
Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section  4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal 
assessments for which the patient consents.  
If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator 
is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144655]. Data 
collected from the patient can continue to be used. 
Note, in countries where the collection and processing of the patient’s personal data is based on 
consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process his/her personal data (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), as applicable, personal data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as 
appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases ) can be included 
after withdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by [CONTACT_1769].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data or Objection to 
Process Patient’s Personal Data  
Where allowed by [CONTACT_1769], the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, and 
use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the study doctor at any 
time in writing or in any other form that may be locally require d. Also, where allowed by [CONTACT_49762], the patient may object to the collection, storage, and use of his/her personal data, informing 
the study doctor at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required. In both 
cases, the Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information (including any data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samples until the time of 
withdrawal/objection) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as 
applicable,  further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study 
The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this 
is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. However, study integrity and interpretation are 
best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study  assessments and follow-up even if study 
drug is discontinued. 
Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section  8.1.6. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165509] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  36 [IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Reason for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation 
The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts will be made to complete and report the 
observations as thoroughly as possible. If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. 
4.3.3. Lost to Follow- Up 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_144746]. The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a r equired study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_144779] [for the patient] to continue in the study, and/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_144754] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s medical record.  
• Should the patient or legal guardian continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study. 
• For patients who are lost to follow-up, the Investigator can search publicly available records (where permitted and allowed by [CONTACT_1769]) to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible. 
4.3.4. Replacement of Study Patients  
No additional patients may be enrolled to mitigate the impact of patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study.  
5. TREATMENTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS  
5.1. Treatments Administered

ALN- AGT01  supplied for this study, including dates of receipt. In addition, accurate records will 
be kept of when and how much ALN-AGT01 is dispensed and administered to each patient in 
the study. Any reasons for departure from the protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165520]- AGT01 will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or 
destroyed at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations. 
Further instructions about drug accountability will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.3. Clinical Product Complaints  
5.3.1. Definition  
A clinical product complaint (CPC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of the investigational product and its packaging after it is released for distribution at clinical site.  
A CPC may be detected prior to use of study drug, during use, or after use. A CPC is typi[INVESTIGATOR_144677]; however, it is possible that investigational product complaints could be 
associated with an AE. Examples of a CPC include, but are not limi ted to: illegible clinical label, 
missing clinical label, damaged vial, empty vial, contamination of investigational product, and 
malfunction of syringe needle safety device. 
5.3.2. Reporting  
For product complaints, the Sponsor or its designee should be notified within [ADDRESS_165521] be evaluated and reported as indicated in Section  6.5.6 instructions on reporting CPCs will also be detailed in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
5.4. Monitoring for Potential Clinical Events  
5.4.1. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hypotension 
Hypotension is an obligate risk of antihypertensive medications. In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored weekly with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential hypotension. Whenever possible, manage ment decisions will be 
based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698]. 
The following management recommendations for hypotension are provided: 
• Low blood pressure that is associated with symptoms should be evaluated at the 
clinical study site or another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144659] 24 hours. Clinical study site 
evaluation for low blood pressure should include the assessment of orthostatic blood 
pressur e.  
• The Investigator should consider downtitration or discontinuation of oral antihypertensives (if taking) if confirmed office SBP <100 mmHg or if clinical symptoms, such as lightheadedness or dizziness , develop coupled with a significantly 
lower SBP compared to prior visits (ie, SBP <110 mmHg).  
• Clinically significant events discovered during the course of a patient’s general medical care should be promptly communicated to the site and evaluated by [CONTACT_144780] -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165522] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  41 Investigator, especially if hypotension is noted. Patients will carry Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) -approved patient cards to facilitate this physician- to-physician 
communication.  
• If hypotension is confirmed, serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured 
and any oral antihypertensive(s) previously started for hypertensive escape should be down-titrated or discontinued.  
• The frequency of blood pressure and biochemical monitoring (serum electrolytes and 
creatinine) should be increased during intercurrent illnesses that predispose patients to 
dehydration (eg, vomiting or diarrhea that persists for more than 24 hours) or when symptoms consistent with decreased effective circulating volume (eg, presyncopal 
symptoms, unexplained falls, decreased urine output) manifest, even if a patient’s 
recent blood pressure measurements have been normal.  
• Hypotension that warrants direct evaluation at the site should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours. In addition, other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (eg, unexplained presyncope, syncope, or falls) should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the site being notified. 
• Management of persistent hypotension may include increased salt intake or, if unresponsive, standard treatments for orthostatic intolerance syndromes such as fludrocortisone or midodrine. 
• Low blood pressure that requires medical treatment (including intravenous fluid support) or other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (see above) should be recorded as AEs. 
5.4.2. Monitoring and Approach for Clinically Significant Blood Pressure Elevation  
In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored 
frequently with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential significant elevations. Whenever 
possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698]. The recommended interventions for potentially clinically significant blood pressure elevation are presented in Table 4.  
Table 4: Recommended Interventions for Potentially Clinically Significant Blood 
Pressure Elevation  
Study Period  Intervention  
Throughout Study • Whenever possible, management decisions should be based on blood 
pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698].  
• Any confirmed event of severe systolic hypertension (office SBP 
≥180 mmHg) should be appropriately treated regardless of its timing 
relative to study drug administration.  
• Because ALN -AGT01 acts on the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS 
inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue 
agents for high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165523] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  42 Study Period  Intervention  
• If added, oral antihypertensives must be used per their labeled instructions 
and in accordance with current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 
2018] 
Day 1 to Month 3 Intervene if clinically significant blood pressure elevation: 
• Because of the gradual onset of effects of ALN-AGT01, interventions for 
asymptomatic hypertension should be avoided in the first 6 weeks after the 
patient’s first administration of study drug.  
• After Week 6 , patients who develop office SBP >160 mmHg and increased 
>10 mmHg from their baseline office  SBP that persists for ≥24 hours on 2 
consecutive measurements or that is accompanied by [CONTACT_144699]. Severely symptomatic patients should be evaluated at the clinical study site or 
another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144659] 24 hours. 
• If persistent hypertension is confirmed (without the identification of a 
specific treatable cause) and the Investigator deems it to be a clinically 
significant change, treatment may be initiated at the medical discretion of 
the Investigator using a CCB  and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic. 
Investigators should avoid long-acting agents that may not fully washout 
between Month 5 and Month 6. 
Months 3 to 6 Treat to target blood pressure using a CCB and/ or thiazide /thiazide -like diuretic : 
• At Month 3, a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic should be added 
if the daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by [CONTACT_44117] . If the Investigator feels 
there is a compelling clinical reason to wait, the rationale for exception should be documented in the eCRF.  
• After Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per 
Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above target (target defined as office SBP <140 mmHg , HBPM  SBP <135 mmHg, 
or daytime  mean  SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135 mmHg). [Williams 2018 ] 
• A temporary hold of oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be performed in 
appropriate patients ( below) from Month 5 to Month 6:  
­ Month 5 office
 SBP <160 mmHg if taking no oral antihypertensive 
agents 
­ Month 5 office S
BP <155 mmHg if taking 1 oral antihypertensive agent 
­ Month 5 office
 SBP <150 mmHg if taking 2 oral antihypertensive 
agents.  
• During this 
4-week period, blood pressure will be carefully monitored by

accompanied by [CONTACT_23805])  
Month 6 to End of 
Study Treat to target blood pressure using Investigator’s choice of oral 
antihypertensive(s ).

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  43 Study Period  Intervention  
• Oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per Investigator 
judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above target (target 
defined as office SBP <140 mmHg; HBPM  SBP <135 mmHg; daytime 
mean SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135 mmHg). [Whelton 2018 ; Williams 2018 ] 
5.4.3. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Renal Dysfunction 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of eGFR 
through the anticipated onset of initial ALN-AGT01 PD. Based upon the renal dysfunction 
associated with conventional RAAS inhibitors,[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] the following 
guidelines apply throughout the study: 
• Study drug (and additional oral antihypertensive agents, if applicable) should be 
prophylactically held during intercurrent illness or volume depletion 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥30% from baseline or to ≤30 mL/min/1.73m
2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, contact 
[CONTACT_1034], and look for potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction such as: 
− NSAIDs, antibiotics, or other treatments known to impair renal function 
− Recent exposure to intravenous contrast agents  
− Hypovolemia 
− Urinary infection 
− Urinary tract obstruction 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥40% from baseline or to 
≤25 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should look for potentially reversible causes of 
renal dysfunction and contact [CONTACT_144701]. Serum creatinine should be monitored at least weekly until improving. 
5.4.4. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hyperkalemia 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of serum 
electrolytes (at least monthly through the anticipated onset of ALN-AGT01 PD). The following 
guidelines apply for potassium elevations detected by [CONTACT_144702].[ McMurray 2016;

Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165527] dose of study drug. 
Occasional use of systemic NSAIDs is allowed. However, given their association with increased 
blood pressure, they should be avoided when possible and alternative analgesics (acetaminophen, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_35791]) should be considered.[ Whelton 2018] When used, the dosing of systemic 
NSAIDs should be at the lower end of the labeled range and for the shortest duration possible.  
Patients will be allowed to receive vaccines (eg, for SARS -CoV- 2) that have received health 
agency authorization (including for emergency use) by [CONTACT_144703]. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by [CONTACT_3786], except as described in Section  5.5.2. However, it is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded on the eCRF. Concomitant medication will be coded using an internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary. 
5.5.1. Oral Antihypertensive Medication   
Individual initiation and modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator 
judgement are permitted throughout the study if required to treat clinically significant blood pressure elevation (Section  5.4.2). In addition, after a patient completes the placebo -controlled 
primary endpoint at Month 3, Investigators will titrate therapy with oral antihypertensives to a target blood pressure range (office SBP <140 mmHg, HBPM SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135  mmHg ). All oral antihypertensive medication that are dosed once 
daily should be taken in the morning. 
Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured  at a central or local laboratory  
approximately 2 weeks after any antihypertensive addition or dose titration. 
5.5.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medication  
The following medications, treatments, and supplements are prohibited throughout the study 
(until the EOT  visit): 
• Conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors)  
• SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) 
• Prescription NSAIDs  
• Chronic/standing use of nonprescription NSAID s 
• Organic nitrate preparations (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, pentaerythritol)  
• Medications, herbal supplements (including Ma Huang and St. John’s wort), or other substances (such as licorice) that are associated with increases in LFT abnormalities or with blood pressure abnormalities are prohibited. This includes certain stimulants (eg, amphetamine, methylphenidate dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine), MAO 
inhibitors, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709] (eg, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), diet pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (eg, 
phenylpropanolamine, sibutramine), and nasal decongestants (eg, phenylephrine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine, naphazoline hydrochloride). 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165528] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  46 • Medications, herbal medicines, over- the-counter medications, or supplements known 
to cause hyperkalemia are prohibited unless individually approved by [CONTACT_144749]. This includes potassium-sparing diuretics, 
potassium suppl ements, cyclo -oxygenase-[ADDRESS_165529] dose, throughout study participation, and through safety follow-up ( if applicable; see Section  3.1).  
Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include: 
• Placement of an intrauterine device.  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient). 
• Established use of oral (except low-dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation. 
• True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent 
patients must agree to use one of the above-mentioned contraceptive methods if they 
start heterosexual relationships during the study and through safety follow-up ( if 
applicable; Section  3.1). 
Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. 
Females of child -bearing potential include female patients who have experienced menarche (or 
begin menarche over the course of the study), and who are not postmenopausal or permanently 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165530] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  47 sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]). A 
postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause, confirmed by [CONTACT_144766].  
For male patients, no contraception is required. However, use by [CONTACT_144706] 
(condom) may be required in some countries, eg, [LOCATION_009], in order to comply with local requirements as described in the corresponding patient ICFs.  
Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144707] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Pregnancy testing will be 
performed before every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of the study (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.2. Alcohol Restrictions  
Patients should limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 units per day (unit: 1 glass of wine [approximately 125 mL] =1 measure of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_2120] [approximately 1 fluid ounce] =½ pi[INVESTIGATOR_43924] [approximately 284 mL]) for the duration 
of the study. Compliance with alcohol restrictions should be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144708]. 
5.7.3. Tobacco and Nicotine Restrictions  
Use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing 
tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e-cigarettes) must be avoided within [ADDRESS_165531] 1 week prior to screening 
assessments of blood pressure. Of note, this is the sodium intake recommended in the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension Guidelines for both hypertensive patients and for the general population.[ Williams 2018 ]  
On days on which samples for fasting lipid panel and glycemic assessments are collected, patients are required to fast for ≥10 hours before sample collection ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.5. Exercise  
Patients should abstain from strenuous exercise for [ADDRESS_165532] es and measurement of vital 
signs and weight (at the discretion of the Investigator). 
6.1. Screening Assessments  
An ICF that has been approved by [CONTACT_144709] (IRB)/IEC must be signed by [CONTACT_144767]. All patients 
or their legal guardians will be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF. 
Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria. Rescreening of patients is permitted with consultation of the Medical Monitor 
(see Section  6.1.2).  
Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained. Any changes to 
medical history occurring between the screening assessment and Day 1 will be updated prior to 
study drug administration. 
6.1.1. Retesting  
If in the Investigator’s judgement, the screening laboratory abnormalities are likely to be 
transient, then laboratory tests may be repeated . The Investigator’s rationale should be 
documented. Laboratory values can be retested once during screening provided that the patient 
can be evaluated for eligibility  after at least 4 weeks of washout and randomized within the 
allowed Screening period. Retesting of screening ABPM is permitted once as described in Section  6.2.1, with eligibility assessed by [CONTACT_144757] . 
6.1.2. Rescreening  
A patient who does not meet all study eligibility criteria due to a transient condition observed at 
screening (eg, prohibited medications that were subsequently discontinued) will be allowed to 
return  once for rescreening. A patient will be re-consented if rescreening occurs outside of the 
60-day screening window. In this case, all screening procedures must be repeated. 
6.2. Efficacy Assessments 
All blood pressure measurements ( ABPM, office, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in Section  10.1.  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives, a washout of at least [ADDRESS_165533] be completed prior 
to measurement of the baseline ABPM (for eligibility) and  baseline office blood pressure. The 
baseline ABPM and office blood pressure must be measured within 2 weeks before randomization. An HBPM unit will be provided during the Screening period to facilitate 
monitoring during the washout of prior oral antihypertensives (if taking) and to establish the 
HBPM baseline prior to randomization. HBPM must be collected after at least [ADDRESS_165534] 2 consecutive weeks (at least 3 recordings per week) prior to randomization 
to establish baseline . 
ABPM placement may be performed at home by [CONTACT_144711], as detailed in the Study Manual. If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure 
assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement ” may be obtained remotely 
using the methods described in Section 10.1. 
Recommendations for approach and monitoring of low blood pressure/hypotension and 
hypertensive escape are provided in Section  5.4.1 and Section  5.4.2, respectively. 
6.2.1. ABPM  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as rescue medication), ABPM must be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication.  
Adequacy will be assessed for all ABPMs. If the ABPM recording is inadequate, the patient will 
be provided [ADDRESS_165535]  be measured  using the automated blood pressure device provided by 
[CONTACT_144712] (prior to taking oral antihypertensives) and at approximately the same time 
each day; therefore, visits should be scheduled at approximately the same time of day, whenever 
possible. Office blood pressure must include orthostatic measurements (seated and standing).  
Exercise, caffeine, alcohol consumption, and use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products 
(including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or 
e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 minutes prior to blood pressure measurements. The use of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood 
pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, 
tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) sho uld be avoided within [ADDRESS_165536]/caffeine or 
taking morning oral medications. HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. 
The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet flat on the floor as detailed in Section  10.[ADDRESS_165537] sites will be given the option of using a wearable blood pressure sensor for 2 periods of 2 to 4 weeks  each  according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1). Wearable blood pressure assessments performed during screening should be obtained 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165538] as described in the 
Study Manual, using the opposite arm as that used for ABPM. 
6.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples for determination of AGT and RAAS biomarkers ( plasma renin concentration, 
AngI, Ang II, and aldosterone) will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1).  Blood samples collected  for AngI and AngII require special processing and will be 
assessed at sites that have appropriate resources, equipment, and reagents. Blood samples for PD 
assessments must be collected before study drug administration (on days when study drug is to be dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing (on other days). Levels of aldosterone will also be analyzed in urine collections at the time points listed in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). Blood AGT levels will be analyzed at a central laboratory by 
[CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent assay for measurement of PD effect. These  biomarkers may be 
analyzed using qualified assays. Details regarding the collection, processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and 
storage of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory  Manual.  
Results will not be used to adjust dosing of ALN-AGT01 or guide other elements of study conduct or clinical management and will not be shared with sites until after study completion. If 
clinical circumstances arise for which such information is required to guide patient care, local 
laboratory assessments  should be drawn. 
6.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for the assessment of plasma concentrations  of ALN -AGT01 
and it s primary metabolite AS(N -1)3′ ALN -AGT01 at the time points indicated in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ). A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples 
for PK analysis is in Table 2. 
Plasma concentrations of ALN -AGT01 and AS(N- 1)3′ ALN -AGT01 will be determined using a 
validated assay. Details regarding sample volumes to be collected, and the processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the study will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs, 
including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and laboratory tests. Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded. 
6.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) and include 
blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. When vital signs and blood 
sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs should be performed before blood samples 
are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be measured predose in the seated position, after 
the patient has rested comfortably for [ADDRESS_165539] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  51 recorded in beats per minute, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_144674] a full minute and recorded 
in breaths per minute. Blood pressure is described in Section  6.2.  
Additional vital sign assessments, as medially indicated, may be added at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
Vital signs results will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5.2. Weight, Height, and Morphometrics 
Height and body weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded in the eCRF. Height will be measured at screening 
only. Height will be measured in centimeters. Body weight should be measured in kilograms to the first decimal point in patients wearing light clothing and without shoes.  
Waist circumference and waist -to-hip- ratio will also be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded on the eCRF. For waist circumference and waist -to-
hip ratio, patients should wear minimal clothing to ensure that the measuring tape is correctly 
positioned. Patients should stand erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, fe et together 
and with their weight equally divided over both legs. To perform the waist measurement, the lowest rib margin is first located and marked with a pen. The iliac crest is then palpated in the midaxillary line, and also marked. It is recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally 
midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in 
position around the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus. The elastic tape thus defines the level of the waist circumferen ce, which can then be measured by [CONTACT_144713]. Hip circumference measurement should be taken around the widest portion of the buttocks. Patients are asked to breathe normally, and to breathe out gently at the time of the measurement to prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding their breath. A 
stretch -resistant tape that provides a constant [ADDRESS_165540] centimeter and entered in the source document. Each 
measurement should be repeated twice; if the measurements are within 1 cm of each other, the average should be calculated. If the difference between the 2 measurements exceeds 1 cm, the 2 measurements should be repeated.   
6.5.3. Physical Examination 
Full and symptom-directed physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ); if a physical examination is scheduled for a dosing visit, it should be 
conducted prior to dosing. Full physical examinations will include the examination of the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascul ar, 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and neurological status. 
Symptom-directed physical examinations will be guided by [CONTACT_144714], 
or the onset of new symptoms, since the last visit. 
Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on 
the medical history or AE eCRF.

Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  52 6.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead ECGs reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, 
and QT interval and Fridericia- corrected QT interval will be obtained  using a local machine , as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients should be supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_165542] changed since the baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of 
the Investigator, or as per DMC advice. Recordings will be archived according to the Study 
Manual.  
6.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory. Specific 
instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. For any other 
unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug 
administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, 
or as per DMC advice, until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis 
is made to adequately explain the abnormality. Additional safety laboratories and assessments as indicated by [CONTACT_144715]. Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in Table 6 and will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).  
While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical decisions, on the day of the assessments all laboratory assessments specified in Table 6 which are performed at the clinic 
should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory. In the case of discrepant local and central 
laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day, central laboratory results will be relied upon for clinical decisions. 
Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical study center or at home by a 
trained healthcare professional. Blood samples collected for RAAS biomarkers should be collected in the  morning and in the seated/upright position ( after blood pressure measurements 
and before any assessments collected in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]). 
Spot urine collections for albumin and creatinine should be obtained in the morning. A 24 -hour 
urine collection for aldosterone, sodium, and creatinine will be performed at time points listed in 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).  These 24 -hour collections should be obtained within 2 
days before the ABPM associated with the same visit.  
For any safety event or laboratory abnormality, additional laboratory assessments, imaging, and consultation may be performed for clinical evaluation and/or in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor; results may be collected and should be included in the cl inical database.

Details regarding the processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and analysis of the samples will be provided in the 
Laboratory Manual. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Testing  
A pregnancy test will be performed for females of child -bearing potential. A serum pregnancy 
test will be performed at screening, and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per 
the Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is suspected. More frequent pregnancy 
testing may be performed where required per local requirements. The results of the pregnancy 
test must be known before study drug administration. Patients who are pregnant at screening are not eligible for study participation. Any woman with a positive urine pregnancy test, 
subsequently confirmed by a positive serum pregnancy test, during the study will be 
discontinued from study drug but will continue to be followed for safety. Patients determined to be pregnant while on study will be followed at least until the pregnancy outcome is known (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for follow -up instructions).

[IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and [ADDRESS_165547] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144678] (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse). 
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest: 
• ALT or AST >3×ULN  
• Severe or serious ISRs; ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or those that lead to temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of ALN-AGT01. 
An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection. “At or near” the injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift 
slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as may occur with swelling or 
hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not considered an ISR. 
For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS], respectively.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165548] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  57 Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated. 
Moderate:  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money). 
Severe:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; 
limiting self -care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden); OR life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; OR death related to an adverse event.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity. Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an 
AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Adverse event severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE).  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Drug  
The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by [CONTACT_144716] a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_5257]?” A “yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to the study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should be asked about medically relevant changes 
in the patient’s health since the last visit. The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should 
also be asked if the patient has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, 
or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and over-the- counter). In addition 
to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient safety. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165549] dose of study drug regardless of their relationship to study drug through the end of study. Non- serious AEs will be  followed until the end of study. 
Events occurring after signing of the ICF and before study drug administration will be captured as medical history (see Section  6.1), while AEs that occur after study drug administration, and 
baseline events that worsen after study drug administration, must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by [CONTACT_144718]. SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by [CONTACT_144719], as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug- related. Each AE must be described in 
detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken, 
and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) in the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the supplemental AEs of 
Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed. Additional clinical and laboratory information may 
be collected. Refer to CRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the 
supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF.  
For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or 
Symptoms eCRF, recording additional information regarding each injection site reaction that is 
entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom(s), injection site location, follow-up actions taken, etc). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the Sponsor or its designee 
should be notified within 24 hours using the appropriate eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737]. Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_165550] the following information: 
• Patient’s study number 
• Description and date of onset of the event 
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug, and 
• Investigator/site information  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165551] information provided in the Study Manual. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by [CONTACT_144720]/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE. These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should be recorded. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by [CONTACT_144721]. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by [CONTACT_144722].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the IRB/IEC per their 
institutional policy by [CONTACT_9304] (or Sponsor designee) according to country 
requirements. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_16211]/IEC notification and 
acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through safety follow-up (Section 3.1), the 
Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_165552] dose of study drug. 
The pregnancy should be followed by [CONTACT_144723]. At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overdose and Other Special Situations  Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose of study drug administered to the participant or taken by [CONTACT_144781] >2× the assigned dose during a single administration and/or ≥[ADDRESS_165553] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  60 In an event of an overdose or other special situations (eg, medication error, abuse, misuse, CPC 
associated with an AE) , the Investigator should: 
• Contact [CONTACT_27909] 24 hours  
• Submit the special situations reporting form within [ADDRESS_165554] information in the Pharmacy Manual 
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities 
• Document the amount of study drug given  
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication will be considered AEs/SAEs.  
Full details of overdose and other special situations reporting instructions will be outlined in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and Biospecimen Repository  
Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144664]. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence 
will result in variations in drug effect. More generally, genetic variations may account for the 
well-described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with hypertension, as well as 
their responses to treatment.  
Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and patient consent, samples will be collected as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may further eluc idate the outcomes of this 
study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or efficacy of ALN -AGT01. 
Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1).  In addition to the dedicated collections for optional exploratory biomarkers (urine, 
plasma, serum) , aliquots from each 24-hour urine collection will be archived for potential 
exploratory investigations. These specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory. Potential exploratory investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as 
they relate to disease progression, efficacy, or safety.  
The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety laboratory samples, PK samples, etc) that are obtained during the study. 
These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following 
the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations. After [ADDRESS_165555] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  61 When biobanking is permitted by [CONTACT_1295], study participants will be advised during the 
informed consent process of these biobanking details and the potential for exploratory 
investigation of their samples.  
7. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock and unblinding for the 
primary analysis. The plan will detail the implementation of the statistical analyses in accordance 
with the principle features stated in the protocol. 
7.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_165556]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg, and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sample size of 375 
patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response relationship in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a 
[ADDRESS_165557] deviation assumptions.

7.2. Statistical Methodology  
The statistical and analytical plans presented below are brief summaries of planned analyses. 
More complete plans will be detailed in the SAP. Changes to the methods described in the final 
SAP will be described and justified as needed in the clinical study report. For information on 
study endpoints, see Section  2. 
7.2.1. Populations to be Analyzed 
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows: 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by- treatment analyses based on the FAS will be according to the 
randomized treatment arm.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165559] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  62 • Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug, grouped 
according to the treatment actually received.  
• PK Analysis Set : All patients who received at least [ADDRESS_165560]- AGT01 concentrations . 
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug and who have 
baseline and at least [ADDRESS_165561]-AGT01 doses and placebo will be tested using a multiple comparison– modeling (MCP 
Mod) approach.[ Bretz 2005 ] The presence of a dose- response trend will be initially tested 
against a set of prespecified dose- response models at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05, 
adjusted for multiplicity (the MCP step). Several candidate models will be prespecified in the 
SAP. Then, the dose-response curves will be further estimated (the modeling step) based on the ‘best’ fitted dose response model. Furthermore, each ALN-AGT01 dose group will be compared against placebo using Dunnett’s Test.  
For the secondary endpoints of change in DBP assessed by [CONTACT_144769] [ADDRESS_165562]. Descriptive statistics for observed levels 
and the relative change from baseline for all measured biomarkers will be presented for each of 
the postdose time points. 
Statistical comparison of the biomarker levels (absolute and/or change from baseline) across 
treatment groups may be explored. Details of the analysis will be specified in the SAP.  
Population PK/PD analysis may be conducted to evaluate the dose-response relationships for PD 
lowering after ALN -AGT01 treatment. Additionally, the relationship between lowering of serum 
AGT and blood pressure may be explored within a modeling framework. If conducted, these analyses will be described in a pharmacometrics analysis plan and results will be presented in a separate report.  
7.2.7. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Plasma concentrations of ALN -AGT01 and its metabolite AS(N -1)3′ ALN -AGT01 will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Population PK analysis may be conducted on the PK data from this study. If conducted, the 
analysis methods will be described in a pharmacometrics analysis plan and results will be 
presented in a separate report.  
7.2.8. Safety Analyses 
The primary parameter is the frequency of treatment -emergent AEs (hereafter referred to simply 
as AEs). Safety parameters also include vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory assessments and physical exams. Extent of exposure will be summarized.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary. Results will be tabulated by [CONTACT_144727] (PT).  
Adverse events will be classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) System Organ Class (SOC) and PT. Adverse events, SAEs, related AEs, AEs leading 
to discontinuation of study drug, and AEs leading to death will be summarized by [CONTACT_144728]. By -patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory parameters, ECG, and vital signs 
summarizing the observed values and changes from baseline over time. Laboratory shift tables 
from baseline grade (or category) to worst post-baseline grade (or category) will be presented for

Other safety summaries will be presented as appropriate. Further details will be specified in the 
SAP.  
7.2.9. Immunogenicity Analyses 
The frequency and percentage of patients with confirmed positive ADA assay at any time during the study as well as at each scheduled visit will be summarized. The titer results for patients with confirmed positive ADA results will be summarized.  
7.2.10. Interim Analysis  
The primary analysis will be conducted after all patients complete the Month 6 visit or withdraw from the study prior to the Month 6 visit. No formal interim analysis is planned before the primary analysis.  
7.2.11. Optional Additional Research  
Optional additional research may be conducted in the future on the biological samples and/or 
data collected during the study in accordance with the strict terms of the ICF (see Section  4.3.2).  
8. STUDY ADMINISTRATION 
8.1. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, all applicable regulatory requirements, and the current guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Compliance with GCP

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  70 10. APPENDICES  
10.1. Measurement of Blood Pressure  
All blood pressure measurements (office, ABPM, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in the relevant user manuals .  
The appropriately sized cuff for each modality must be used for all assessments. The arm’s circumference at midpoint (halfway between the acromion and olecranon) should be determined 
at screening with a metric tape measure and used to select the appropriat ely sized blood pressure 
cuff/bladder for each instrument as described in the Study Manual. Unless significant weight loss 
or gain occurs between visits, the patient should use the same cuff/bladder size throughout the study. 
At the first Screening visit only, office blood pressure will be measured in both arms to select the 
appropriate arm to use for office blood pressure and HBPM measurements. Unless a concomitant 
condition favors the use of a specific arm, the arm with the higher office SBP should be used for 
all subsequent office blood pressure and HBPM readings. The ABPM should be measured using the patient’s nondominant arm. If the patient is ambidextrous, the same arm used for office blood pressure and HBPM readings should be used. 
ABPM  
The appropriately sized cuff should be placed on the correct arm following the instructions in the 
Study Manual. In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as rescue 
medication), ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication. All ABPM collections must be in the outpatient/ambulatory state.  ABPM recordings that are 
associated with dosing visits must be obtained in advance of the visit (within 7 days before the corresponding dosing visit) and  the res ults reviewed prior to dosing. 
During the 24-hour monitoring period, patients must avoid strenuous exercise but should 
otherwise maintain their usual level of physical activity. The ABPM is programmed to take 
readings every 20 minutes during the day (6 am to 9:59 pm) and every 30 minutes during the night (10 pm to 5:59 am). While awake, the patient should hold their arm still by [CONTACT_144736] a reading. Patients must record the timing of going to sleep, waking up, 
and any oral medications taken during the ABPM, and these responses must be entered into the eCRF.  
After the monitoring period is complete, upload the ABPM data to receive a report with adequacy assessment. An ABPM will be considered adequate if (1) the number of successful 
daytime readings is ≥33, (2)  the number of successful nighttime readings is ≥11, and (3) no more 
than 3 hours are not represented (ie, 3 sections of 60 minutes where 0 valid readings were obtained) . If the ABPM recording is inadequate, the patient will be provided [ADDRESS_165574] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  71 Office blood pressure should be measured early in the visit, before phlebotomy or other 
potentially stressful assessments. To minimize confounding by [CONTACT_144738], study visits 
should be scheduled for a consistent timeframe of the day. The use of inhaled short- acting beta 
agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. 
The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) 
should be avoided within 48 hours prior to measuring blood pressure. 
Before measuring blood pressure, confirm that there has been no exercise or use of caffeine or 
nicotine- or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, 
cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e- cigarettes) with in the last [ADDRESS_165575] blood pressure measurements, ask the patient to use the bathroom before the assessment. 
All office blood pressure assessments will include both seated and standing measurements.  
Seated Office Blood Pressure Measurement:  For seat
 ed measurements, the patient should be in a 
comfortable resting position in a chair with their back supported and their feet flat on the floor. 
• Place the appropriately sized cuff on the correct arm with no clothing between the 
patient’
s arm and the cuff and with the midpoint of the bladder length positioned over 
the brachial artery (located by [CONTACT_23302]). The arm should be supported on an armrest or table with mid -cuff at heart level and the palm facing the ceiling.  
• Follow the Study Manual to initiate the automated blood pressure device’s seated 
measurement protocol. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by 
[ADDRESS_165576] 3 individual 
measurements.  
• During the device’s seated measurement protocol, the staff member should leave the room and the patient should remain at rest without distraction (avoid mobile phones). The following script may be used: “The blood pressure device works best when you are at  rest and without any distraction. If you agree, I would like to leave the room for 
the next [ADDRESS_165577], followed by [CONTACT_2902] 5 minutes of the device inflating to measure your blood pressure”.  
Standing Office Blood Pressure Measurement: A standing measurement should be obtained 
immediately after collection of the seated measurements.  
• Being careful to maintain the cuff’s position, ask the patient to stand with the cuffed arm bent s
lightly and the hand of the cuffed arm supported at heart level.  
• Using a stopwatch or watch, measure standing blood pressure 1 minute after standing by [CONTACT_144739]’s single measurement protocol.  
• After the standing measurement, ask the patient if they experienced dizziness or light-headedness when standing and enter their response in the eCRF. 
If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement ” may be obtained remotely by a visiting nurse or other 
appropriately trained personnel who will bring an office blood pressure instrument to the 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165578] -AGT01  
Amendment 1, 20 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  72 patient’s location and follow the same procedure performed at the site. If a home visit is not 
possible, a “remote visit blood pressure measurement ” should instead be obtained using the 
patient’s HBPM instrument under direct supervision (phone call or teleconferencing) by 
[CONTACT_144740], following the instructions detailed in the Study Manual. Results and the remote method used should be entered into the eCRF. 
HBPM  
Patients should measure HBPM every morning, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning 
oral medications.  HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. The HBPM 
measurement should be obtained in a room without distractions, seated comfortably with the 
back supported and feet flat on the floor. The patient will initiate the automated blood pressure 
program on their HBPM device. This program includes a 5- minute period of rest, followed by [ADDRESS_165579] 2 consecutive weeks (and 
with at least 3 successful readings per week) prior to randomization. Patients previously taking medication for hypertension must be without antihypertensives for ≥4 weeks prior to collecting 
these baseline HBPM measurements.  If adequate baseline HBPM data (at least [ADDRESS_165580] 2 consecutive weeks) are not collected within the Screening period, 
the patient is a screen failure.  
After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at least [ADDRESS_165581]-AGT01-002

I have read the ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165584] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  6 of the study design is provided in Figure 1. Before randomization, patients will discontinue prior 
antihypertensive medications (if taking) for a Washout period of at least 4 weeks . Patients who 
complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for enrollment will 
receive ALN -AGT01 or placebo for the first 6 months of the 12-month Double-blind ( DB) 
treatment period.  
Starting at Month 3, conventional oral antihypertensives may be added per Investigator 
judgement for elevated blood pressure. Oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be temporarily 
held from Month [ADDRESS_165585]-AGT01 alone (vs placebo) at Month 6 
by [CONTACT_46674] ( ABPM ). During this 4-week period, blood pressure 
will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144760]. Patients may resume conventional oral antihypertensives at Month [ADDRESS_165586]-AGT01 open-label extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reaches Month 12 prior 
to availability of the OLE study , they may  continue their current blinded dosing in the DB 
Extension period for up to 12 additional months until the OLE study is open and then transition. 
Number of Planned Patients  
Approximately 375 patients will be enrolled in this study.  
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
This study will include adults (18 to 75 years, inclusive) with untreated hypertension or on stable 
therapy with 1 or more antihypertensive medications of the following classes: an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II-receptor blocker, renin inhibitor, calcium channel 
blocker, thiazide diuretic, and/or thiazide-like diuretic. Patients should have a mean 24-hour 
systolic blood pressure ( SBP) ≥135 mmHg and ≤[ADDRESS_165587]- AGT01 is a n SC administered N -acetylgalactosamine -conjugated small interfering RNA 
targeting liver -expressed messenger RNA for angiotensinogen (AGT). 
Patients randomized to receive ALN -AGT01 will be administered [ADDRESS_165588] -AGT01 beginning at Month 6.  
Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Placebo (sodium chloride 0.9% w/v for SC administration) will be administered once every [ADDRESS_165589] -AGT01 is up to 24 months. The estimated total time on 
study for each patient is up to 44 months, including up to 2 months of screening, followed by [CONTACT_25765] 24 months of treatment, and up to 18 months in the Follow-up period. 
Statistical Methods  
The planned enrollment for this study is 375 patients. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] (mean 24 hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg). 
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_165590]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg,  and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sample size of 375 
patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response 
relationship in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_165591]-AGT01 dose versus placebo with a 2 -sided 
significance level of 0.05.  
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows:  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by- treatment analyses based on the FAS will be according to the 
randomized treatment arm.  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug, grouped 
according to the treatment actually received.  
• Pharmacokinetic ( PK) Analysis Set : All patients who received at least [ADDRESS_165592] -AGT01 concentrations . 
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug and who have 
baseline and at least [ADDRESS_165593] -AGT01

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Sponsor) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_144647]- AGT01, a  subcutaneously (SC) 
administered  investigational agent comprised of a synthetic small interfering (siRNA) covalently 
linked to a triantennary N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand, which is designed to suppress 
liver production of angiotensinogen (AGT) and thereby  [CONTACT_144776].  
1.1. Study Rationale  
Study ALN- AGT01 -002 (KARDIA -1) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-
ranging, multicenter Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and 
pharmacodynamics ( PD) of ALN -AGT01, administered SC, in patients with mild -to-moderate 
hypertension. Patients will be randomized to [ADDRESS_165604] 6 months of the 12-month Double-blind (DB) period. After the first [ADDRESS_165605]-AGT01 open- label 
extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reaches Month [ADDRESS_165606] on systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 
Month 3, as assessed by [CONTACT_46674] (ABPM). Se condary and 
exploratory objectives of the study include evaluating the efficacy of ALN-AGT01 on other measures of blood pressure response and evaluating the PD effect of ALN -AGT01, including 
reduction in circulating AGT concentration. 
The full rationale for the study and design is presented in Section  3.2. 
1.2. Background  
Hypertension affects 30% to 45% of adults and is the strongest modifiable risk factor for 
cardiovascular  disease, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction.[ Olsen 2016; Williams 2018 ] 
The worldwide disease burden is profound, with a global prevalence of over 1 billion,[ Kearney 
2005; NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017] and approximately 9 million deaths attributed to hypertension annually.[ Angell 2015] 
Currently available pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144672] a minority of 
patients, due in large part to  physician inertia and patient nonadherence to  daily oral 
medication. [Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Low adherence to oral antihypertensives is 
associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes and is prevalent at all stages of disease. [Corrao 
2011; Peacock and Krousel -Wood 2017; Schulz 2016; van der Laan 2017] Thus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_144669], current rates of control are low , and the global burden 
of death and disability- adjusted life -years attributed to elevated blood pressure remains 
high.[ Forouzanfar 2017; Muntner 2020] Development of new approaches to treat hypertension 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165607] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  22 and to overcome the limitations of current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217] a key unmet need.[ Dzau and Balatbat 
2019; McClellan 2019; Services 2020] 
The Sponsor is developi[INVESTIGATOR_144647]- AGT01, a novel synthetic RNA interference ( RNAi ) 
therapeutic, for SC administration for the treatment of hypertension. RNAi is a naturally 
occurring cellular mechanism for regulation of gene expression, mediated through the binding of 
siRNA to its complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, leading to mRNA cleavage and subsequent suppression of the synthesis and levels of the target protein. ALN- AGT01 
contains an siRNA targeting AGT  mRNA, conjugated to a GalNAc-containing liga nd to facilitate 
delivery to the liver. Based on the mechanism of RNAi, ALN-AGT01 is specifically designed to reduce the hepatic synthesis of AGT protein, the first substrate in the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sole precursor of vasoactive angiotensin peptides.[ Khanna 
2017; Romero 2015] Because hepatocytes are the predominant source of circulating AGT, 
ALN-AGT01 has been developed to reduce blood pressure by [CONTACT_144742] (AngII). 
Preliminary d ata from  Part A of the ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_165608]- AGT01 -001 (hereafter referred 
to as Study 001) in patients with hypertension have shown that  single SC doses of ALN- AGT01 
lead to dose-dependent and durable reductions in circulating AGT, accompanied by [CONTACT_144685] (DBP). Reductions in AGT for up to 
[ADDRESS_165609] adverse events (AEs) have been mild or moderate in severity, and there have been no 
severe or serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study drug. There have been no clinically significant elevations in serum creatinine or serum potassium, and no patient has required 
intervention for low blood pressure. No clinically significant alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) 
elevation s have been observed in Part A  patients who received ALN-AGT01 doses as high as 
800 mg. Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported in  a minority of patients and were all mild 
and transient events that resolved without intervention. 
This Phase [ADDRESS_165610]-AGT01 across a 
range of doses (150 to 600 mg) and dose intervals (once every 3 months and once every 6 
months) to identify optimal treatment. The  consistent and prolonged PD effect of ALN -AGT01  
is expected to achieve the unique benefit of continuous 24-hour blood pressure lowering with 
infrequent SC dosing.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ALN-AGT01 is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
Clinical data available from Study [ADDRESS_165611]-AGT01, administered SC, in patients 
with mild -to-moderate hypertension. A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 1. 
Before randomization, patients will discontinue prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) for 
a Washout period of at least 4 weeks .  
DB and DB Extension Period s 
Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for enrollment will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive 1 of the following regimens over a 12-month 
DB treatment period. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by 
[CONTACT_144681] (mean 24 hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg) .  
• Placebo SC once every 3 months, with re -randomization (1:1:1:1) at Month [ADDRESS_165612] -AGT01 regimens 
• [ADDRESS_165613]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months

At Month 3, conventional oral antihypertensives may be added per Investigator judgement for daytime mean SBP ≥ 135 mmHg  by [CONTACT_44117]. After Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications 
may also be added per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above 
target (target defined as office SBP <140 mmHg, home blood pressure monitoring [ HBPM ] SBP 
<135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP <135 mmHg  by [CONTACT_44117] ). Oral antihypertensives (if taking) 
will be temporarily held from Month 5 to Month 6 in appropriate patients (Month 5 office SBP <155 mmHg if taking 1 oral antihypertensive agent or office SBP <150 mmHg if taking 2 
agents) to assess the effect of ALN -AGT01 alone (vs placebo) at Month 6 by [CONTACT_44117]. During this 
4-week period, blood pressure will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144777] >170 mmHg (or if confirmed 
office SBP >160 mmHg accompanied by [CONTACT_23805]). 
Patients may be eligible to participate in an ALN -AGT01 OLE study upon completion of the 
Month 12 predose assessments. If an individual patient reaches Month 12 prior to availability of 
the OLE study, they may continue their current blinded dosing in the DB Extension period for up to 12 additional months until the OLE study is open and then transition. Once the OLE study is 
open for enrollment, eligible patients may rollover into the OLE study at Months 12, 18, or 24 
(whichever visit occurs first).  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165617] dose of study drug: 
• Patients who discontinue study drug before Month 6: Safety Follow- up visits will occur 
once every [ADDRESS_165618] patient’s Month 6 visit 
or until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline l evel, 
whichever comes later.  
• Patients who discontinue study drug after the Month 6 visit: Safety Follow- up visits will 
occur once every [ADDRESS_165619] dose of study drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline level.  
Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will be asked to complete the remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration) through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, early termination (ET) assessments should be performed. 
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 375 patients  (75 patients per group). 
The duration of treatment with ALN -AGT01 is up to [ADDRESS_165620]-AGT01 across a range of doses and 
dose intervals to identify optimal treatment regimens for study in Phase 3. 
Patients will discontinue prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) for at least 4 weeks prior 
to study drug administration. During the study, blood pressure will be monitored with both 
outpatient 24-hour ABPM and automated office blood pressure measurements 
(EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in 
the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016). The primary endpoint will be assessed by [CONTACT_144687]. In addition, 24-hour ABPM can 
assess short -term blood pressure variability and circadian patterns (including potential restoration 
of the normal nocturnal blood pressure dippi[INVESTIGATOR_144650] 21% to 35% of hypertensive 
patients). [de la Sierra 2009 ; White 1998] More frequent measurements will be collected through 
a third method, oscillometric HBPM, to assess long-term blood pressure variability and provide close safety monitoring for potential hypotension (or hypertension) while not in the clinic.

Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  27 As recommended by [CONTACT_144688] (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH] Principles for Clinical Evaluation of 
New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000 and EMA/CHMP/[ZIP_CODE]/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016), the first [ADDRESS_165622] ethical standards for the treatment of pati ents with hypertension, individual 
modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator judgement to maintain blood 
pressure within target is permitted starting at Month 3 and will continue throughout the study 
(except between Month 5 and Month 6 as described in Section  3.1). Separate from these treat -to-
target modifications, any confirmed event of severe systolic hypertension (SBP ≥180 mmHg) will be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
If a patient requires treatment with a conventional oral antihypertensive before Month 6, a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and/or thiazide/thiazide- like diuretic will be added because there 
is extensive experience combining these classes with antihypertensive drugs that impact the RAAS. Additionally, their blood pressure effects are expected to washout within [ADDRESS_165623] -AGT01 at Month 6 (trough for the 
once every 6 month regimens) relative to placebo  is critical to evaluate the feasibility of once 
every 6 month dosing regimens for future study in Phase 3. Accordingly, oral antihypertensives 
(if taking) will be temporarily held from Month 5 to the Month 6 ABPM assessment. For each 
patient, this limited interruption in oral antihypertensives will be contingent upon the patient’s 
Month 5 office SBP being adequately controlled (see Table 4 ) and the Investigator’s assessment 
that interruption can be safely performed and carefully monitored by [CONTACT_144762]. Of note, a withdrawal period is a standard element in studies of oral antihypertensives that is often used to establish assay sensitivity, to demonstrate maintenance of efficacy, and to assess possible withdrawal effects (ICH E12A; Principles for Clinical Evaluation 
of New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000). Outside of research studies, antihypertensives are temporarily discontinued in clinical practice for diagnostic purposes, and interruptions up to [ADDRESS_165624] been shown to  be safe. [Beeftink 2017] In this study, the period of interruption is 
limited to [ADDRESS_165625] -AGT01. If a clinically significant blood pressure elevation (confirmed SBP >170 
mmHg; or SBP >160 mmHg accompanied by [CONTACT_23805]) occurs after the interruption of oral 
antihypertensives, Investigators will instruct the patient to promptly resume dosing with their 
existing supply of oral medication.  
After Month 6, other oral antihypertensives may be used at the discretion of the Investigator, 
following current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Because ALN -AGT01 acts on 
the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin II-receptor blocker [ARB], 
angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue agents for 
high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study. Blood pressure and pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/PD assessments will be collected through Month [ADDRESS_165626] -AGT01 for the liver is hypothesized to improve tolerability 
relative to current oral antihypertensives, [Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] the protocol’s monitoring 
plan is designed to meet the standards set by [CONTACT_144751],[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] with improvements to include the use of the newer 
oral potassium binder patiromer for treatment of potential hyperkalemia.[ Georgianos and 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165627] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  28 Agarwal 2018; Weir 2015 ] The risk of renal safety events is further mitigated in this study by [CONTACT_144778], which exclude patients who are at highest risk to have events (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 mL/min/1.73m2, baseline serum potassium >5 mEq/L, 
poorly controlled diabetes, or severely increased albuminuria) and those who may have 
decreased tolerance for renal safety events (patients with clinically significant heart failure, 
valvular heart disease, or recent hi story of cardiovascular event).  
3.3. Justification for Dose  
The doses of ALN-AGT01 in this study were selected on the basis of data from the Phase [ADDRESS_165628] an acceptable 
safety profile , and clinically significant placebo -corrected reductions in mean SBP >[ADDRESS_165629] s (ie, lowering of serum AGT) and antihypertensive responses. This is expected to enable 
development of population average dose-response relationships for PD and efficacy to guide identification of optimal treatment regimens  (dose and dose frequency) for Phase 3.  
Preliminary PK/PD modeling based on serum AGT data from Study [ADDRESS_165630]-AGT01 results in a dose-dependent lowering of serum AGT,  with maximum reductions 
predicted to be achieved as early as 1 month postdose and  significant reductions sustained for 
close to 6 months after dosing. Modeling of the relationship between serum AGT lowering and blood pressure suggests a log- linear relationship, with ≥92% reduction in serum AGT predicted 
to achieve median SBP reduction of ≥10 mmHg.  
Based on these, the once every 6 month doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg were selected to result in 
median serum AGT reductions of 81.9%, 89.4%, and 94.9%, respectively, at trough (Month 6), 
translating to median SBP reductions of 6.67 mmHg, 8.74 mmHg, and 11.6 mmHg, respectively. Thus, the selected doses will enable characterization of the dose-response relationships for serum AGT and blood pressure with the once every 6 month regimen. 
The selected doses also enable characterization of the dose-response relationships for serum 
AGT and blood pressure with once every 3 month regimens based on analysis of data from all arms  at Month 3. This will provide support for development of a once every 3 month regimen, if 
desired . To this end, 300 mg once every 3 months will be evaluated to identify any cumulative 
effects. The 300 mg once every 3 months dose is predicted to result in median serum AGT reductions of >95% at trough (Month 3), translating to median SBP reductions of >[ADDRESS_165631] -AGT01 as an antihypertensive therapeutic that results in reduction of blood pressure by 
≥10 mmHg throughout the dosing interval with infrequent administration. 
3.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
Using the Interactive Response Technology (IRT), patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_165632] 6 months of the 12-month DB period: 
• Placebo SC once every [ADDRESS_165633] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  29 • [ADDRESS_165634]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_165635]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
• [ADDRESS_165636]-AGT01 SC once every 3 months 
• [ADDRESS_165637]-AGT01 SC once every 6 months 
Patients initially randomized to placebo will be re -randomized 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_165638] -AGT01 regimens. 
Patients who enter the DB Extension period will continue their current blinded dosing regimen 
from the DB period. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (black vs all other races) and by [CONTACT_144681] 
(mean 24 hour SBP < or ≥145 mmHg) . 
Each patient will be uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and patient identification number. Upon signing the informed consent form (ICF), the patient will be assigned a patient identification number by [CONTACT_82550] . The Investigator or his/her designee 
will randomize the patient in IRT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. The Investigator or his/her designee will re-randomize the patient in IRT at Month [ADDRESS_165639]-AGT01 dose groups. 
3.5. Blinding  
The Sponsor, all site personnel (except for the site pharmacist or delegate ), and patients will be 
blinded to study drug treatment through Month 6 of the 12-month DB period. After the database 
lock to support the analysis of Month 6 data is complete, the Sponsor will be unblinded to 
treatment assignment, but the site personnel (except for the site pharmacist)  and patients will 
remain blinded to treatment assignment until after  the analysis of Month 12 data is complete.  
Blinded doses of study drug will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator (see Section  5.2.2). All patients will receive the same volume and number of injections regardless of 
treatment assignment (patients receiving once every [ADDRESS_165640]- AGT01  to maintain the blind). 
Because ALN-AGT01 may be slightly  visually distinguishable from placebo, all blinded study 
drug doses will be prepared and the syringe (s) will be masked by a site pharmacist  or delegate  
prior to administration by a blinded healthcare professional. See the Pharmacy Manual for additional details.  
3.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
If the treating physician determines that the clinical management of the patient requires 
knowledge of the study drug assignment, the Investigator may break the blind, as necessary, in 
IRT. If time permits, clinical study center personnel should contact [CONTACT_144752] [ADDRESS_165641] reached the end of the study if  the patient : 
• has completed at least the Month 12 visit and enrolled in the OLE study, or 
• has completed the Safety Follow -up visits as described in Section 3.1 for patients who 
discontinue study drug or do not enroll in the OLE study.

4.3. Removal from Study Drug or Assessment  
Patients or their legal guardians are free to discontinue study drug and/or stop protocol procedural assessments, or participation in the study as a whole at any time and for any reason, without penalty to their continuing medical care. The Investigator or the Sponsor may 
discontinue study drug or stop a patient’s participation in the study at any time if this is 
considered to be in the patient’s best interest. Any discontinuation of treatment or the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144652]’s participation in the study must be fully documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and should be followed up by [CONTACT_737]. 
Discontinuation of study drug or declining procedural assessments is described in Section  4.3.1, 
while the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a patient’s participation in the study is detailed in Section  4.3.2. 
4.3.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug or Declining Procedural Assessments  
Reasons for discontinuation of study drug include any of the following: 
• Significant protocol deviation; which includes required treatment with prohibited 
medication (as defined in Section  5.5.2) per Investigator discretion 
• AE 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165651] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  34 • Non-adherence to treatment regimen  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Other reason (non- AE) 
• Or, study is terminated by [CONTACT_144745], the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor or Medical Monitor before 
discontinuing dosing in the patient. Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study 
drug dosing immediately (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for reporting and follow-up of pregnancy). A 
positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug. 
Patients who discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments should not be 
automatically removed from study. In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for 
any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments and 
study visits so that their experience is captured in the final analyses.  
If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1), including different options for follow-up and collection 
of data (eg, in person, by [CONTACT_648], by [CONTACT_2319], through family or friends, or from options not 
involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians or from review 
of medical records), including endpoints and AEs, and must document this decision in the patient’s medical records.  
If a patient discontinues dosing due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason 
must be recorded in the eCRF. Patients who discontinue study drug and remain on study may 
receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator 
judge ment, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue from study drug before Month 6 will be encouraged to remain on the 
study and complete assessments (excluding PK assessments) through Month 6. They will also be 
asked to complete S afety Follow-up visits once every [ADDRESS_165652] dose of study drug 
per the safety follow- up schedule (see Table 1)  until the last patient’s Month 6 visit or until PD 
recovery (whichever is later); see Section  3.1. 
Patients who discontinue study drug after the Month 6 visit will be asked to return for their next scheduled visit to complete end of treatment ( EOT )/ET assessments and complete S afety Follow-
up visits once every [ADDRESS_165653] dose of study drug per the safety follow-up schedule (see Table 1)  until PD recovery; see Section 3.1. 
4.3.2. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient  or Legal Guardian Stops Participation in the Study  
A patient  or their legal guardian  may stop participation in the study at any time. A patient or 
legal guardian considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144653] [ADDRESS_165654] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  35 informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and 
remain in the study to complete their study assessments through the Month [ADDRESS_165655] the Month 6 visit assessments at an earlier time ( Table 1).  
A patient considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144654] 6 visit should be informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study to complete the assessments scheduled for the EOT /ET visit and complete 
Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section  4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal 
assessments for which the patient consents.  
If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator 
is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144655]. Data 
collected from the patient can continue to be used. 
Note, in countries where the collection and processing of the patient’s personal data is based on 
consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process his/her personal data (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), as applicable, personal data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as 
appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases ) can be included 
after withdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by [CONTACT_1769].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data or Objection to 
Process Patient’s Personal Data  
Where allowed by [CONTACT_1769], the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, and 
use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the study doctor at any 
time in writing or in any other form that may be locally require d. Also, where allowed by [CONTACT_49762], the patient may object to the collection, storage, and use of his/her personal data, informing 
the study doctor at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required. In both 
cases, the Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information (including any data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samples until the time of 
withdrawal/objection) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as 
applicable,  further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study 
The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this 
is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. However, study integrity and interpretation are 
best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study  assessments and follow-up even if study 
drug is discontinued. 
Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section  8.1.6.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  36 [IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Reason for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation 
The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts will be made to complete and report the 
observations as thoroughly as possible. If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. 
4.3.3. Lost to Follow- Up 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_144746]. The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a r equired study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_144779] [for the patient] to continue in the study, and/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_144754] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s medical record.  
• Should the patient or legal guardian continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study. 
• For patients who are lost to follow-up, the Investigator can search publicly available records (where permitted and allowed by [CONTACT_1769]) to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible. 
4.3.4. Replacement of Study Patients  
No additional patients may be enrolled to mitigate the impact of patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study.  
5. TREATMENTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS  
5.1. Treatments Administered  
Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study and must not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. Study drug that has been dispensed and returned unused must not be re-dispensed.

• [ADDRESS_165663] the Medical Monitor. After such consultation, the dose may be 
administered up to 42 days before the next scheduled dose. Thereafter, the dose will be 
considered missed and not administered. 
Patients will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of study drug. However, if a patient misses 
2 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss 
whether the patient will be able to continue the study (see also Section  4.3).

5.2.5. Preparation, Handling, and Storage 
Staff at each clinical study center will be responsible for preparation of ALN -AGT01 or placebo 
doses according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. No special procedures for the 
safe handling of study drug are required. 
ALN- AGT01  will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 2 to 30°C until dose 
preparation. Deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the 
Sponsor and use of ALN -AGT01  halted until authorization for its continued use has been 
provided by [CONTACT_16015], as described in the Pharmacy Manual. 
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
Instructions specific to unused study drug and additional storage will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
5.2.6. Packaging and Labeling 
All packaging, labeling, and production of study drug will be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice specifications, as well as applicable local regulations. Study drug labels 
and external packaging will include all appropriate information as per local labeling 
requirements. Additional detail s will be available in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.2.7. Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of 
ALN- AGT01  supplied for this study, including dates of receipt. In addition, accurate records will 
be kept of when and how much ALN-AGT01 is dispensed and administered to each patient in 
the study. Any reasons for departure from the protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165667]- AGT01 will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or 
destroyed at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations. 
Further instructions about drug accountability will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.3. Clinical Product Complaints  
5.3.1. Definition  
A clinical product complaint (CPC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of the investigational product and its packaging after it is released for distribution at clinical site.  
A CPC may be detected prior to use of study drug, during use, or after use. A CPC is typi[INVESTIGATOR_144677]; however, it is possible that investigational product complaints could be 
associated with an AE. Examples of a CPC include, but are not limi ted to: illegible clinical label, 
missing clinical label, damaged vial, empty vial, contamination of investigational product, and 
malfunction of syringe needle safety device. 
5.3.2. Reporting  
For product complaints, the Sponsor or its designee should be notified within [ADDRESS_165668] be evaluated and reported as indicated in Section  6.5.6 instructions on reporting CPCs will also be detailed in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
5.4. Monitoring for Potential Clinical Events  
5.4.1. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hypotension 
Hypotension is an obligate risk of antihypertensive medications. In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored weekly with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential hypotension. Whenever possible, manage ment decisions will be 
based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698]. 
The following management recommendations for hypotension are provided: 
• Low blood pressure that is associated with symptoms should be evaluated at the 
clinical study site or another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144659] 24 hours. Clinical study site 
evaluation for low blood pressure should include the assessment of orthostatic blood 
pressur e.  
• The Investigator should consider downtitration or discontinuation of oral antihypertensives (if taking) if confirmed office SBP <100 mmHg or if clinical symptoms, such as lightheadedness or dizziness , develop coupled with a significantly 
lower SBP compared to prior visits (ie, SBP <110 mmHg).  
• Clinically significant events discovered during the course of a patient’s general medical care should be promptly communicated to the site and evaluated by [CONTACT_144780] -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165669] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  41 Investigator, especially if hypotension is noted. Patients will carry Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) -approved patient cards to facilitate this physician- to-physician 
communication.  
• If hypotension is confirmed, serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured 
and any oral antihypertensive(s) previously started for hypertensive escape should be down-titrated or discontinued.  
• The frequency of blood pressure and biochemical monitoring (serum electrolytes and 
creatinine) should be increased during intercurrent illnesses that predispose patients to 
dehydration (eg, vomiting or diarrhea that persists for more than 24 hours) or when symptoms consistent with decreased effective circulating volume (eg, presyncopal 
symptoms, unexplained falls, decreased urine output) manifest, even if a patient’s 
recent blood pressure measurements have been normal.  
• Hypotension that warrants direct evaluation at the site should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours. In addition, other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (eg, unexplained presyncope, syncope, or falls) should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the site being notified. 
• Management of persistent hypotension may include increased salt intake or, if unresponsive, standard treatments for orthostatic intolerance syndromes such as fludrocortisone or midodrine. 
• Low blood pressure that requires medical treatment (including intravenous fluid support) or other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (see above) should be recorded as AEs. 
5.4.2. Monitoring and Approach for Clinically Significant Blood Pressure Elevation  
In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored 
frequently with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential significant elevations. Whenever 
possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698]. The recommended interventions for potentially clinically significant blood pressure elevation are presented in Table 4.  
Table 4: Recommended Interventions for Potentially Clinically Significant Blood 
Pressure Elevation  
Study Period  Intervention  
Throughout Study • Whenever possible, management decisions should be based on blood 
pressure measurements confirmed by [CONTACT_144698].  
• Any confirmed event of severe systolic hypertension (office SBP 
≥180 mmHg) should be appropriately treated regardless of its timing 
relative to study drug administration.  
• Because ALN -AGT01 acts on the RAAS, the use of conventional RAAS 
inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as rescue 
agents for high blood pressure will be avoided throughout this study.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165670] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  42 Study Period  Intervention  
• If added, oral antihypertensives must be used per their labeled instructions 
and in accordance with current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 
2018] 
• The Investigator should consider downtitration or discontinuation of oral 
antihypertensives (if taking) if confirmed office SBP <100 mmHg (or 
<115 mmHg with clinical symptoms such as lightheadedness or dizziness).  
Day 1 to Month 3 Intervene if clinically significant blood pressure elevation: 
• Because of the gradual onset of effects of ALN-AGT01, interventions for 
asymptomatic hypertension should be avoided in the first 6 weeks after the 
patient’s first administration of study drug.  
• After Week 6 , patients who develop office SBP >160 mmHg and increased 
>10 mmHg from their baseline office  SBP that persists for ≥24 hours on 2 
consecutive measurements or that is accompanied by [CONTACT_144699]. Severely 
symptomatic patients should be evaluated at the clinical study site or 
another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144659] 24 hours. 
• If persistent hypertension is confirmed (without the identification of a 
specific treatable cause) and the Investigator deems it to be a clinically significant change, treatment may be initiated at the medical discretion of 
the Investigator using a CCB  and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic. 
Investigators should avoid long-acting agents that may not fully washout 
between Month 5 and Month 6. 
Months 3 to 6 Treat to target blood pressure using a CCB and/ or thiazide /thiazide -like diuretic : 
• At Month 3, a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic should be added 
if the daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by [CONTACT_44117] . If the Investigator feels 
there is a compelling clinical reason to wait, the rationale for exception 
should be documented in the eCRF.  
• After Month 3, oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per 
Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above target (target defined as office SBP <140 mmHg , HBPM  SBP <135 mmHg, 
or daytime  mean  SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135 mmHg). [Williams 2018 ] 
• A temporary hold of oral antihypertensives (if taking) will be performed in 
appropriate patients ( below) from Month 5 to Month 6:  
­ Month 5 office
 SBP <160 mmHg if taking no oral antihypertensive 
agents 
­ Month 5 office S
BP <155 mmHg if taking 1 oral antihypertensive agent 
­ Month 5 office
 SBP <150 mmHg if taking 2 oral antihypertensive 
agents.  
• During this 
4-week period, blood pressure will be carefully monitored by 
[CONTACT_144765] >170 mmHg (or if confirmed office SBP >160 mmHg 
accompanied by [CONTACT_23805])

Study Treat to target blood pressure using Investigator’s choice of oral 
antihypertensive(s ). 
• At Month 6, prior oral antihypertensive should be restarted per Investigator judgement if daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by [CONTACT_44117]. 
• Oral antihypertensive medications may also be added per Investigator 
judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above target (target 
defined as office SBP <140 mmHg; HBPM  SBP <135 mmHg; daytime 
mean SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135 mmHg). [Whelton 2018 ; Williams 2018 ] 
5.4.3. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Renal Dysfunction 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of eGFR 
through the anticipated onset of initial ALN-AGT01 PD. Based upon the renal dysfunction 
associated with conventional RAAS inhibitors,[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] the following 
guidelines apply throughout the study: 
• Study drug (and additional oral antihypertensive agents, if applicable) should be prophylactically held during intercurrent illness or volume depletion 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥30% from baseline or to ≤30 mL/min/1.73m
2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, contact 
[CONTACT_1034], and look for potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction such as: 
− NSAIDs, antibiotics, or other treatments known to impair renal function 
− Recent exposure to intravenous contrast agents  
− Hypovolemia 
− Urinary infection 
− Urinary tract obstruction 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥40% from baseline or to 
≤25 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should look for potentially reversible causes of 
renal dysfunction and contact [CONTACT_144701]. Serum creatinine should be monitored at least weekly until improving. 
5.4.4. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hyperkalemia 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of serum 
electrolytes (at least monthly through the anticipated onset of ALN-AGT01 PD). The following guidelines apply for potassium elevations detected by [CONTACT_144702].[ McMurray 2016; 
Parving 2012]

The availability of patiromer will be assessed  at participating study sites. This potassium-binding 
drug is approved for the treatment of hyperkalemia and has been shown to safely reduce serum 
potassium levels and to maintain long-term normokalemia in chronic kidney disease patients 
receiving background conventional RAAS inhibitor therapy.[ Georgianos and Agarwal 2018; 
Weir 2015] 
5.5. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Use of concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1). Concomitant medications include all 
prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the counter medications, vitamins, and minerals. Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the eCRF.

Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165674] dose of study drug. 
Occasional use of systemic NSAIDs is allowed. However, given their association with increased 
blood pressure, they should be avoided when possible and alternative analgesics (acetaminophen, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_35791]) should be considered.[ Whelton 2018] When used, the dosing of systemic 
NSAIDs should be at the lower end of the labeled range and for the shortest duration possible.  
Patients will be allowed to receive vaccines (eg, for SARS -CoV- 2) that have received health 
agency authorization (including for emergency use) by [CONTACT_144703]. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by [CONTACT_3786], except as described in Section  5.5.2. However, it is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded on the eCRF. Concomitant medication will be coded using an internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary. 
5.5.1. Oral Antihypertensive Medication   
Individual initiation and modification of oral antihypertensive medications per Investigator 
judgement are permitted throughout the study if required to treat clinically significant blood pressure elevation (Section  5.4.2). In addition, after a patient completes the placebo-controlled 
primary endpoint at Month 3, Investigators will titrate therapy with oral antihypertensives to a target blood pressure range (office SBP <140 mmHg, HBPM SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP  by [CONTACT_44117] <135  mmHg ). All oral antihypertensive medication that are dosed once 
daily should be taken in the morning. 
Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured  at a central or local laboratory  
approximately 2 weeks after any antihypertensive addition or dose titration. 
5.5.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medication  
The following medications, treatments, and supplements are prohibited throughout the study 
(until the EOT  visit): 
• Conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors)  
• SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) 
• Prescription NSAIDs  
• Chronic/standing use of nonprescription NSAID s 
• Organic nitrate preparations (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, pentaerythritol)  
• Medications, herbal supplements (including Ma Huang and St. John’s wort), or other substances (such as licorice) that are associated with increases in LFT abnormalities or with blood pressure abnormalities are prohibited. This includes certain stimulants (eg, amphetamine, methylphenidate dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine), MAO 
inhibitors, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709] (eg, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), diet pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (eg, 
phenylpropanolamine, sibutramine), and nasal decongestants (eg, phenylephrine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine, naphazoline hydrochloride). 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165675] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  46 • Medications, herbal medicines, over- the-counter medications, or supplements known 
to cause hyperkalemia are prohibited unless individually approved by [CONTACT_144749]. This includes potassium-sparing diuretics, 
potassium suppl ements, cyclo -oxygenase-[ADDRESS_165676] dose, throughout study participation, and through safety follow-up ( if applicable; see Section  3.1).  
Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include: 
• Placement of an intrauterine device.  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient). 
• Established use of oral (except low-dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation. 
• True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent 
patients must agree to use one of the above-mentioned contraceptive methods if they 
start heterosexual relationships during the study and through safety follow-up ( if 
applicable; Section  3.1). 
Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. 
Females of child -bearing potential include female patients who have experienced menarche (or 
begin menarche over the course of the study), and who are not postmenopausal or permanently 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165677] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  47 sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]). A 
postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause, confirmed by [CONTACT_144766].  
For male patients, no contraception is required. However, use by [CONTACT_144706] 
(condom) may be required in some countries, eg, [LOCATION_009], in order to comply with local requirements as described in the corresponding patient ICFs.  
Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144707] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Pregnancy testing will be 
performed before every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of the study (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.2. Alcohol Restrictions  
Patients should limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 units per day (unit: 1 glass of wine [approximately 125 mL] =1 measure of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_2120] [approximately 1 fluid ounce] =½ pi[INVESTIGATOR_43924] [approximately 284 mL]) for the duration 
of the study. Compliance with alcohol restrictions should be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144708]. 
5.7.3. Tobacco and Nicotine Restrictions  
Use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing 
tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e-cigarettes) must be avoided within [ADDRESS_165678] 1 week prior to screening 
assessments of blood pressure. Of note, this is the sodium intake recommended in the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension Guidelines for both hypertensive patients and for the general population.[ Williams 2018 ]  
On days on which samples for fasting lipid panel and glycemic assessments are collected, patients are required to fast for ≥10 hours before sample collection ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.5. Exercise  
Patients should abstain from strenuous exercise for [ADDRESS_165679] es and measurement of vital 
signs and weight (at the discretion of the Investigator). 
6.1. Screening Assessments  
An ICF that has been approved by [CONTACT_144709] (IRB)/IEC must be signed by [CONTACT_144767]. All patients 
or their legal guardians will be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF. 
Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria. Rescreening of patients is permitted with consultation of the Medical Monitor 
(see Section  6.1.2).  
Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained. Any changes to 
medical history occurring between the screening assessment and Day 1 will be updated prior to 
study drug administration. 
6.1.1. Retesting  
If in the Investigator’s judgement, the screening laboratory abnormalities are likely to be 
transient, then laboratory tests may be repeated . The Investigator’s rationale should be 
documented. Laboratory values can be retested once during screening provided that the patient 
can be evaluated for eligibility  after at least 4 weeks of washout and randomized within the 
allowed Screening period. Retesting of screening ABPM is permitted once as described in Section  6.2.1, with eligibility assessed by [CONTACT_144757] . 
6.1.2. Rescreening  
A patient who does not meet all study eligibility criteria due to a transient condition observed at 
screening (eg, prohibited medications that were subsequently discontinued) will be allowed to 
return  once for rescreening. A patient will be re-consented if rescreening occurs outside of the 
60-day screening window. In this case, all screening procedures must be repeated. 
6.2. Efficacy Assessments 
All blood pressure measurements ( ABPM, office, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in Section  10.1.  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives, a washout of at least [ADDRESS_165680] be completed prior 
to measurement of the baseline ABPM (for eligibility) and  baseline office blood pressure. The 
baseline ABPM and office blood pressure must be measured within 2 weeks before randomization. An HBPM unit will be provided during the Screening period to facilitate 
monitoring during the washout of prior oral antihypertensives (if taking) and to establish the 
HBPM baseline prior to randomization. HBPM must be collected  after at least [ADDRESS_165681] 2 consecutive weeks (at least 3 recordings per week) prior to randomization 
to establish baseline . 
ABPM placement may be performed at home by [CONTACT_144711], as detailed in the Study Manual. If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure 
assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement ” may be obtained remotely 
using the methods described in Section 10.1. 
Recommendations for approach and monitoring of low blood pressure/hypotension and 
hypertensive escape are provided in Section  5.4.1 and Section  5.4.2, respectively. 
6.2.1. ABPM  
In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as rescue medication), ABPM must be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication.  
Adequacy will be assessed for all ABPMs. If the ABPM recording is inadequate, the patient will 
be provided [ADDRESS_165682]  be measured  using the automated blood pressure device provided by 
[CONTACT_144712] (prior to taking oral antihypertensives) and at approximately the same time 
each day; therefore, visits should be scheduled at approximately the same time of day, whenever 
possible. Office blood pressure must include orthostatic measurements (seated and standing).  
Exercise, caffeine, alcohol consumption, and use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products 
(including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or 
e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 minutes prior to blood pressure measurements. The use of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood 
pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, 
tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) sho uld be avoided within [ADDRESS_165683]/caffeine or 
taking morning oral medications. HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. 
The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet flat on the floor as detailed in Section  10.[ADDRESS_165684] sites will be given the option of using a wearable blood pressure sensor for 2 periods of 2 to 4 weeks  each  according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1). Wearable blood pressure assessments performed during screening should be obtained 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165685] as described in the 
Study Manual, using the opposite arm as that used for ABPM. 
6.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples for determination of AGT and RAAS biomarkers ( plasma renin concentration, 
AngI, Ang II, and aldosterone) will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1).  Blood samples collected  for AngI and AngII require special processing and will be 
assessed at sites that have appropriate resources, equipment, and reagents. Blood samples for PD 
assessments must be collected before study drug administration (on days when study drug is to be dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing (on other days). Levels of aldosterone will also be analyzed in urine collections at the time points listed in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). Blood AGT levels will be analyzed at a central laboratory by 
[CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent assay for measurement of PD effect. These  biomarkers may be 
analyzed using qualified assays. Details regarding the collection, processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and 
storage of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory  Manual.  
Results will not be used to adjust dosing of ALN-AGT01 or guide other elements of study conduct or clinical management and will not be shared with sites until after study completion. If 
clinical circumstances arise for which such information is required to guide patient care, local 
laboratory assessments  should be drawn. 
6.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for the assessment of plasma concentrations  of ALN -AGT01 
and it s primary metabolite AS(N -1)3′ ALN -AGT01 at the time points indicated in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ). A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples 
for PK analysis is in Table 2. 
Plasma concentrations of ALN -AGT01 and AS(N- 1)3′ ALN -AGT01 will be determined using a 
validated assay. Details regarding sample volumes to be collected, and the processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the study will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs, 
including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and laboratory tests. Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded. 
6.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) and include 
blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. When vital signs and blood 
sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs should be performed before blood samples 
are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be measured predose in the seated position, after 
the patient has rested comfortably for [ADDRESS_165686] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  51 recorded in beats per minute, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_144674] a full minute and recorded 
in breaths per minute. Blood pressure is described in Section  6.2.  
Additional vital sign assessments, as medially indicated, may be added at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
Vital signs results will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5.2. Weight, Height, and Morphometrics  
Height and body weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded in the eCRF. Height will be measured at screening 
only. Height will be measured in centimeters. Body weight should be measured in kilograms to the first decimal point in patients wearing light clothing and without shoes.  
Waist circumference and waist -to-hip- ratio will also be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1) and will be recorded on the eCRF. For waist circumference and waist -to-
hip ratio, patients should wear minimal clothing to ensure that the measuring tape is correctly 
positioned. Patients should stand erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, fe et together 
and with their weight equally divided over both legs. To perform the waist measurement, the lowest rib margin is first located and marked with a pen. The iliac crest is then palpated in the midaxillary line, and also marked. It is recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally 
midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in 
position around the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus. The elastic tape thus defines the level of the waist circumferen ce, which can then be measured by [CONTACT_144713]. Hip circumference measurement should be taken around the widest portion of the buttocks.[ Ma 2004 ] Patients are asked to breathe normally, and to breathe out gently at the 
time of the measurement to prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding their 
breath. A stretch -resistant tape that provides a constant [ADDRESS_165687] centimeter and entered in the source document. Each 
measurement should be repeated twice; if the measurements are within 1 cm of each other, the average should be calculated. If the difference between the 2 measurements exceeds 1 cm, the 2 measurements should be repeated. [Ma 2004 ] 
6.5.3. Physical Examination 
Full and symptom-directed physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ); if a physical examination is scheduled for a dosing visit, it should be 
conducted prior to dosing. Full physical examinations will include the examination of the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascul ar, 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and neurological status. 
Symptom-directed physical examinations will be guided by [CONTACT_144714], 
or the onset of new symptoms, since the last visit. 
Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on 
the medical history or AE eCRF.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  52 6.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead ECGs reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, 
and QT interval and Fridericia- corrected QT interval will be obtained  using a local machine , as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients should be supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_165689] changed since the baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of 
the Investigator, or as per DMC advice. Recordings will be archived according to the Study 
Manual.  
6.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory. Specific 
instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. For any other 
unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug 
administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, 
or as per DMC advice, until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis 
is made to adequately explain the abnormality. Additional safety laboratories and assessments as indicated by [CONTACT_144715]. Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in Table 6 and will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).  
While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical decisions, on the day of the assessments all laboratory assessments specified in Table 6 which are performed at the clinic 
should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory. In the case of discrepant local and central 
laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day, central laboratory results will be relied upon for clinical decisions. 
Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical study center or at home by a 
trained healthcare professional. Blood samples collected for RAAS biomarkers should be collected in the  morning and in the seated/upright position ( after blood pressure measurements 
and before any assessments collected in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]). 
Spot urine collections for albumin and creatinine should be obtained in the morning. A 24 -hour 
urine collection for aldosterone, sodium, and creatinine will be performed at time points listed in 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).  These 24 -hour collections should be obtained within 2 
days before the ABPM associated with the same visit.  
For any safety event or laboratory abnormality, additional laboratory assessments, imaging, and consultation may be performed for clinical evaluation and/or in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor; results may be collected and should be included in the cl inical database.

fasting glucose, insulin, lipid panel, and HbA1c. Samples should be collected at approximately the same time of day (±2 hours). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunogenicity  
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Blood samples for ADA 
testing must be collected before study drug administration (on days when study drug is to be 
dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing (on other days) as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). A blood sample to evaluate ADA will be 
collected at the ET visit, if applicable. Blood samples for ADA will be analyzed at a central laboratory. 
Details regarding the processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and analysis of the samples will be provided in the 
Laboratory Manual. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Testing

test will be performed at screening, and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per 
the Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is suspected. More frequent pregnancy 
testing may be performed where required per local requirements. The results of the pregnancy 
test must be known before study drug administration. Patients who are pregnant at screening are not eligible for study participation. Any woman with a positive urine pregnancy test, 
subsequently confirmed by a positive serum pregnancy test, during the study will be 
discontinued from study drug but will continue to be followed for safety. Patients determined to be pregnant while on study will be followed at least until the pregnancy outcome is known (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for follow -up instructions).

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  56 6.5.6. Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and [ADDRESS_165694] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144678] (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse).  
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest: 
• ALT or AST >3×ULN  
• Severe or serious ISRs; ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or those that lead to temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of ALN-AGT01. 
An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection. “At or near” the injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift 
slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as may occur with swelling or 
hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not considered an ISR. 
For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS], respectively.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165695] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  57 Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated. 
Moderate:  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money). 
Severe:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; 
limiting self -care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden); OR life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; OR death related to an adverse event.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity. Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an 
AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Adverse event severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE).  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Drug  
The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by [CONTACT_144716] a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_5257]?” A “yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to the study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should be asked about medically relevant changes 
in the patient’s health since the last visit. The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should 
also be asked if the patient has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, 
or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and over-the- counter). In addition 
to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient safety. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165696] dose of study drug regardless of their relationship to study drug through the end of study. Non- serious AEs will be  followed until the end of study. 
Events occurring after signing of the ICF and before study drug administration will be captured as medical history (see Section  6.1), while AEs that occur after study drug administration, and 
baseline events that worsen after study drug administration, must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by [CONTACT_144718]. SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by [CONTACT_144719], as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug- related. Each AE must be described in 
detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken, 
and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) in the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the supplemental AEs of 
Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed. Additional clinical and laboratory information may 
be collected. Refer to CRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the 
supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF.  
For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or 
Symptoms eCRF, recording additional information regarding each injection site reaction that is 
entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom(s), injection site location, follow-up actions taken, etc). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the Sponsor or its designee 
should be notified within 24 hours using the appropriate eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737]. Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_165697] the following information: 
• Patient’s study number 
• Description and date of onset of the event 
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug, and 
• Investigator/site information  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165698] information provided in the Study Manual. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by [CONTACT_144720]/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE. These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should be recorded. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by [CONTACT_144721]. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by [CONTACT_144722].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the IRB/IEC per their 
institutional policy by [CONTACT_9304] (or Sponsor designee) according to country 
requirements. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_16211]/IEC notification and 
acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through safety follow-up (Section 3.1), the 
Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_165699] dose of study drug. 
The pregnancy should be followed by [CONTACT_144723]. At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overdose and Other Special Situations  Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose of study drug administered to the participant or taken by [CONTACT_144781] >2× the assigned dose during a single administration and/or ≥[ADDRESS_165700] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  60 In an event of an overdose or other special situations (eg, medication error, abuse, misuse, CPC 
associated with an AE) , the Investigator should: 
• Contact [CONTACT_27909] 24 hours  
• Submit the special situations reporting form within [ADDRESS_165701] information in the Pharmacy Manual 
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities 
• Document the amount of study drug given  
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication will be considered AEs/SAEs.  
Full details of overdose and other special situations reporting instructions will be outlined in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and Biospecimen Repository  
Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144664]. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence 
will result in variations in drug effect. More generally, genetic variations may account for the 
well-described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with hypertension, as well as 
their responses to treatment.  
Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and patient consent, samples will be collected as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may further eluc idate the outcomes of this 
study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or efficacy of ALN -AGT01. 
Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1).  In addition to the dedicated collections for optional exploratory biomarkers (urine, 
plasma, serum) , aliquots from each 24 hour urine collection will be archived for potential 
exploratory investigations. These specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory. Potential exploratory investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as 
they relate to disease progression, efficacy, or safety.  
The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety laboratory samples, PK samples, etc) that are obtained during the study. 
These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following 
the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations. After [ADDRESS_165702] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  61 When biobanking is permitted by [CONTACT_1295], study participants will be advised during the 
informed consent process of these biobanking details and the potential for exploratory 
investigation of their samples.  
7. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock and unblinding for the 
primary analysis. The plan will detail the implementation of the statistical analyses in accordance 
with the principle features stated in the protocol. 
7.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a standard deviation in the range of [ADDRESS_165703]-AGT01 and placebo of 10 mmHg, and a 15% dropout rate at Month 3, a sample size of 375 
patients (75 per treatment group) provides at least 84% power to detect a dose response relationship in SBP reduction among all ALN-AGT01 doses and placebo at the 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05. In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_165704] deviation assumptions.

The statistical and analytical plans presented below are brief summaries of planned analyses. 
More complete plans will be detailed in the SAP. Changes to the methods described in the final 
SAP will be described and justified as needed in the clinical study report. For information on 
study endpoints, see Section  2. 
7.2.1. Populations to be Analyzed 
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows: 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by- treatment analyses based on the FAS will be according to the 
randomized treatment arm.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165706] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  62 • Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug, grouped 
according to the treatment actually received.  
• PK Analysis Set : All patients who received at least [ADDRESS_165707]- AGT01 concentrations . 
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug and who have 
baseline and at least [ADDRESS_165708]-AGT01 doses and placebo will be tested using a multiple comparison– modeling (MCP 
Mod) approach.[ Bretz 2005 ] The presence of a dose- response trend will be initially tested 
against a set of prespecified dose- response models at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05, 
adjusted for multiplicity (the MCP step). Several candidate models will be prespecified in the 
SAP. Then, the dose-response curves will be further estimated (the modeling step) based on the ‘best’ fitted dose response model. Furthermore, each ALN-AGT01 dose group will be compared against placebo using Dunnett’s Test.  
For the secondary endpoints of change in DBP assessed by [CONTACT_144769] [ADDRESS_165709]. Descriptive statistics for observed levels 
and the relative change from baseline for all measured biomarkers will be presented for each of 
the postdose time points. 
Statistical comparison of the biomarker levels (absolute and/or change from baseline) across

Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165720] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  70 10. APPENDICES  
10.1. Measurement of Blood Pressure  
All blood pressure measurements (office, ABPM, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_1034], according to the methods described in the relevant user manuals .  
The appropriately sized cuff for each modality must be used for all assessments. The arm’s circumference at midpoint (halfway between the acromion and olecranon) should be determined 
at screening with a metric tape measure and used to select the appropriat ely sized blood pressure 
cuff/bladder for each instrument as described in the Study Manual. Unless significant weight loss 
or gain occurs between visits, the patient should use the same cuff/bladder size throughout the study. 
At the first Screening visit only, office blood pressure will be measured in both arms to select the 
appropriate arm to use for office blood pressure and HBPM measurements. Unless a concomitant 
condition favors the use of a specific arm, the arm with the higher office SBP should be used for 
all subsequent office blood pressure and HBPM readings. The ABPM should be measured using the patient’s nondominant arm. If the patient is ambidextrous, the same arm used for office blood pressure and HBPM readings should be used. 
ABPM  
The appropriately sized cuff should be placed on the correct arm following the instructions in the 
Study Manual. In patients taking oral antihypertensives (including those initiated as rescue 
medication), ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication. All ABPM collections must be in the outpatient/ambulatory state.  ABPM recordings that are 
associated with dosing visits must be obtained in advance of the visit (within 7 days before the corresponding dosing visit) and  the results  reviewed prior to dosing. 
During the [ADDRESS_165721] avoid strenuous exercise but should 
otherwise maintain their usual level of physical activity. The ABPM is programmed to take 
readings every 20 minutes during the day (6 am to 9:59 pm) and every 30 minutes during the night (10 pm to 5:59 am). While awake, the patient should hold their arm still by [CONTACT_144736] a reading. Patients must record the timing of going to sleep, waking up, 
and any oral medications taken during the ABPM, and these responses must be entered into the eCRF.  
After the monitoring period is complete, upload the ABPM data to receive a report with adequacy assessment. An ABPM will be considered adequate if (1) the number of successful 
daytime readings is ≥33, (2)  the number of successful nighttime readings is ≥11, and (3) no more 
than 3 hours are not represented (ie, 3 sections of 60 minutes where 0 valid readings were obtained) . If the ABPM recording is inadequate, the patient will be provided [ADDRESS_165722] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  71 Office blood pressure should be measured early in the visit, before phlebotomy or other 
potentially stressful assessments. To minimize confounding by [CONTACT_144738], study visits 
should be scheduled for a consistent timeframe of the day. The use of inhaled short- acting beta 
agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. 
The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) 
should be avoided within 48 hours prior to measuring blood pressure. 
Before measuring blood pressure, confirm that there has been no exercise or use of caffeine or 
nicotine- or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, 
cigars, cigarettes, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], nicotine patches, or e- cigarettes) with in the last [ADDRESS_165723] blood pressure measurements, ask the patient to use the bathroom before the assessment. 
All office blood pressure assessments will include both seated and standing measurements.  
Seated Office Blood Pressure Measurement:  For seat
 ed measurements, the patient should be in a 
comfortable resting position in a chair with their back supported and their feet flat on the floor. 
• Place the appropriately sized cuff on the correct arm with no clothing between the 
patient’
s arm and the cuff and with the midpoint of the bladder length positioned over 
the brachial artery (located by [CONTACT_23302]). The arm should be supported on an armrest or table with mid -cuff at heart level and the palm facing the ceiling.  
• Follow the Study Manual to initiate the automated blood pressure device’s seated 
measurement protocol. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by 
[ADDRESS_165724] 3 individual 
measurements.  
• During the device’s seated measurement protocol, the staff member should leave the room and the patient should remain at rest without distraction (avoid mobile phones). The following script may be used: “The blood pressure device works best when you are at  rest and without any distraction. If you agree, I would like to leave the room for 
the next [ADDRESS_165725], followed by [CONTACT_2902] 5 minutes of the device inflating to measure your blood pressure”.  
Standing Office Blood Pressure Measurement: A standing measurement should be obtained 
immediately after collection of the seated measurements.  
• Being careful to maintain the cuff’s position, ask the patient to stand with the cuffed arm bent s
lightly and the hand of the cuffed arm supported at heart level.  
• Using a stopwatch or watch, measure standing blood pressure 1 minute after standing by [CONTACT_144739]’s single measurement protocol.  
• After the standing measurement, ask the patient if they experienced dizziness or light-headedness when standing and enter their response in the eCRF. 
If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement ” may be obtained remotely by a visiting nurse or other 
appropriately trained personnel who will bring an office blood pressure instrument to the 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -[ADDRESS_165726] -AGT01  
Original, 09 April 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  72 patient’s location and follow the same procedure performed at the site. If a home visit is not 
possible, a “remote visit blood pressure measurement ” should instead be obtained using the 
patient’s HBPM instrument under direct supervision (phone call or teleconferencing) by 
[CONTACT_144740], following the instructions detailed in the Study Manual. Results and the remote method used should be entered into the eCRF. 
HBPM  
Patients should measure HBPM every morning, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning 
oral medications.  HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. The HBPM 
measurement should be obtained in a room without distractions, seated comfortably with the 
back supported and feet flat on the floor. The patient will initiate the automated blood pressure 
program on their HBPM device. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by [ADDRESS_165727] 2 consecutive weeks (and 
with at least 3 successful readings per week) prior to randomization. Patients previously taking medication for hypertension must be without antihypertensives for ≥4 weeks prior to collecting 
these baseline HBPM measurements.  If adequate baseline HBPM data (at least [ADDRESS_165728] 2 consecutive weeks) are not collected within the Screening period, 
the patient is a screen failure.  
After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at least [ADDRESS_165729] convenient for their personal schedule. The frequency of HBPM monitoring should be increased to daily during the temporary hold of oral antihypertensives performed in some patients from Month 5 to Month 6.

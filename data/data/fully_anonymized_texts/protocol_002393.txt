Statistical 
Methodology   
Cardiac events  are defined as any of the following:  
- Presence of symptoms and signs attributable 
to HF (increasing shortn ess of breath, 
orthopnea, PND, bilateral ankle swelling) as 
confirmed by a cardiologist  
- Cardiac arrhythmia requiring pharmacological 
or electrical treatment  
- Myocardial infarction 
- Sudden cardiac death or death due to 
myocardial infarct, arrhythmia or HF  
 
Asymptomatic worsening of cardiac function  defined as:  
- Asymptomatic decline in LVEF > 10% points 
from baseline and/or EF < 35% corroborated 
by a confirmatory echocardiogram in 2- 4 
weeks   
 
Planned oncologic therapy is defined as:  
- In the adjuvant setting: com pletion of 1 year 
total of HER2 targeted therapy. If a patient 
already received part of the planned HER2 
targeted therapy prior to enrollment in this trial, 
planned oncologic therapy will be achieved 
when a total of 1 year is completed.  
- In the metastatic setting: cessation of treating 
regimen due to progressive disease or non-
cardiac toxicity or non- cardiac death.  
 
The study is designed to assess the rate of completion of planned oncology therapy in the absence of 
a cardiac event or 
asymptomatic worsening of cardiac function.  A completion rate of 
30% is considered of clinical relevance as to benefit breast cancer 
patients who would otherwise not be given HER2 targed therapy, 
where as a completion rate is of 10% is considered similar to the current practice.  
A two stage design with a total of [ADDRESS_353538] 30% versus if it is 
below 10% with 80% power at a significance level of 5%.  
 
An exact confidence interval of the completion rate will be 
calculated. We esti mate there will be no more than a 10% cardiac 
event rate. Due to the low expected cardiac event rate and small 
sample size, the analysis of secondary endpoints will be 
descriptive and will not include specific hypothesis testing. We will summarize the strain, troponins at each time point and graphically 
assess these measures over time in patients that do and not 
experience cardiac events.   
 
  
 
[ADDRESS_353539] Cancer  
 
Human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in approximately 25% of 
breast cancers1. In the era preceding the development of HER2 targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], HER2 
positive breast cancer was associated with a poor prognosis2. However, the development of 
trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the HER2 receptor, resulted in improvements in survival in both adjuvant and metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer
3-7.  
 
 Efficacy  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338]- III trial of trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in the first -line management of 
HER2 -positive metastat ic breast cancer ( MBC ) demonstrated robust improvements in response 
rates (RRs; 50% vs. 32%), median time to progression (TTP; 7.4 vs. 4.6 months) and median 
overall survival ( OS; 25 vs. 20 months) with the addition of trastuzumab3. In the adjuvant setting, 
trastuzumab was also found to be associated with improved survival outcomes. In a review of 
eight trials that involved 11,[ADDRESS_353540] cancer, trastuzumab 
significantly reduced recurrence and mortality: hazard ratio ( HR) 0 .66, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.77, p < 
0.[ZIP_CODE] for OS, and HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.71, p<0.[ZIP_CODE] for  disease free survival (DFS) 
favoring the trastuzumab -containing regimens)8. 
 
 Cardiac toxicity  
HER2 targeted therapy has been associated with cardiac dysfunction. Although not expected in the initial trials of trastuzumab for metastatic breast cancer, retrospective analysis revealed 
rates of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction ranging from 3 to 27%. The incidence was greatest in patients receiving concomitant anthracy clines
9, particularly if the cumulative dose of doxorubicin 
given concurrent ly with trastuzumab exceeded 300mg/m2. As a result, when the evaluation of 
trastuzumab moved into the adjuvant setting, most trials avoided co- administration of 
trastuzumab with anthracyclines and  cumulative anthracyclines doses were limited. In addition, 
trials employed stringent cardiovascular elig ibility criteria, cardiac  monitoring schema, 
algorithms for holding trastuzumab in the setting of cardiac toxicity and early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] r ules 4-7.  
 
Although difficult to generalize due to differing definitions of cardiac endpoints across the trials, observed rates of severe trastuzumab -associated cardiac toxicity, (including various classes of 
symptomatic heart failure and cardiac death) in the adjuvant trastuzumab trials were low (0-4.1%) and early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_289840]. For example, in the combined analysis of the 
NSABP B- 31 and NCCTG N9831 trials of adjuvant trastuzumab, 14.2% of patients temporarily 
discontinued trastuzumab due to confirmed asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) and 4.7% due to symptomatic heart failure (HF) or other adverse cardiac 
events
4. Similarly, in the BCIRG006 adjuvant trastuzumab trial, 9- 18% of the trastuzumab 
treated patients experienced a sustained drop in LVEF7.  
 
Trastuzumab -associated cardiac toxicity often occurs early during the course of treatment 
(median time to presentation 7.8 months) and is most commonly manifested by [CONTACT_289884]10. In contrast to anthracyclines -associated cardiac toxicity9,11-13, 
trastuzumab- associated cardiac toxicity is not dose- dependent  and is reversible within six 
months of discontinuing trastuzumab therapy  for the majority of patients14. Recent data on long -
term follow up of cardiac function in NSABP B- 31 reveals that the 7- year cumulative incidence 
of protocol defined cardiac events (CEs) was  4.0% in patients who received trastuzumab and 
1.3%  in patients who did not resulting in an absolute difference in events of 2.7%.  CEs were 
6 
  
defined as a definite or probable cardiac death or congestive heart failure (CHF)  manifested by 
[CONTACT_289885] 10 percentage points from baseline to a value less than 55% or a decrease of more  
than 5% to a value below the lower limit of normal. Only two CEs occurred more than [ADDRESS_353541] that the sooner 
trastuzumab is given following  doxorubicin administration, the greater the extent of 
cardiotoxicity
17. Indeed, in the combined analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, of 3497 
patients who had an evaluation of LVEF after  doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide therapy,  233 
(6.7 percent) had an LVEF that declined at least  16 percentage points from baseline or that 
declined below the lower limit of normal or had cardiac  symptoms during such treatment that 
would  preclude the initiation of trastuzumab therapy4.  
 
 
 Current clinical recommendations  
According to the current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved package insert, patients 
should have LVEF  evaluation prior to initiation of trastuzumab and at regular intervals during 
treatment. Pati ents should not receive it  if there is evidence of cardiomyopathy. During 
treatment, if patients are found to have an absolute decrease in LVEF ≥16% from pre -treatment 
values or LVEF ≤50% and ≥10% absolute decrease from baseline, trastuzumab should be held 
until repeated echocardiogram confirms LVEF recovery.  
 
 
Newer HER2 targeted therapi [INVESTIGATOR_289841], the development of newer HER2 targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as lapatinib, 
pertuzumab and ado -trastuzumab emtansine (also known as T -DM1) , have led to continued 
improvements in outcomes for HER2 positive breast cancer 18-20. 
 
 Efficacy  
Lapatini b with capecitabine has been shown to be superior to capecitabine alone in women with 
HER2 positive advanced breast cancer that had progressive disease after exposure to 
trastuzumab18. Lapatinib received approval by [CONTACT_13632] [ADDRESS_353542] cancer.  
 
Like trastuzumab, pertuzumab targets the HER2 extracellular domain but at a different epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] , 
resulting in inhibited dimeriz ation of HER2 with other HER family receptors (EGFR/HER1, HER3 
and HER4). Recently published results of the Cleopatra trial showed an increase in progression 
free survival  (PFS) of 6.1 months (p<0.001) with the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab w ith 
docetaxel in first line treatment of metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer, as well as a strong 
trend towards improved OS in the pertuzumab group
19. The FDA recently approved pertuzumab 
[ADDRESS_353543] cancer and LVEF of 50% or more . 
 
Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is a novel anti -HER2 antibody -drug conjugate that comprises 
trastuzumab and the cytotoxic agent mertansine ( DM1 ), a highly potent derivate of the 
antimicrotubule agent maytansine. Results from the EMILIA study, a phase III trial of ado-
trastuzumab emtansine compared with capecitabine plus lapatinib in metastatic HER2 positive 
patients who had progressed after taxane/trastuzumab therapy, revealed a significant 
improvement in PFS favoring ado- trastuzumab emtansine (9.6 vs. 6.4 months)20. Median OS at 
the second interim analysis crossed the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_289842] (30.9 months vs. 25.1 
months; HR  for death from any cause, 0.68;  95% CI, 0.55 to 0.85; P<0.001). The FDA recently 
approved ado- trastuzumab emtansine for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer.  
 
 
 Cardiac toxicity  
In the cardiac safety evaluation, lapatinib infrequently affected the LVEF, with only 1.6% of 
patients experiencing a decrease in LVEF and most of them asymptomatic (1.4%). In a pooled 
analysis of 3689 patients enrolled in 44 clinical studies, of the total of 7 patients with symptomatic LVEF decrease, cardiotoxicity resolved in all but one, which suggests that cardiac 
effects of lapatinib are mild and mostly reversible
21. 
 
Since trastuzumab and pertuzumab both target the HER2 receptor and are structurally similar, 
additive cardiac toxicity could be anticipated when the two drugs are administered concurrently. However the addition of pertuzumab did not increase rates of symptomatic or asymptomatic 
cardiac dysfunction in the Cleopatra trial . The rate of  LV systolic dysfunction of any grade was 
8.3% in the placebo group and 4.4% in the pertuzumab group. Similarly, the rate of grade 3 or 
higher cardiac toxicity was 2.8% in the placebo group and 1.2% in the pertuzumab group. 
Notably, only patients with LVEF of 50% or more were enrolled in this trial
19. 
 
Regarding ado- trastuzumab emtansine, cardiac toxicity was not increased in the cohort of 
patients treated with the experimental drug, compared to the lapatinib arm (1.7%  vs.1.6%)20. 
However, the data on cardiac safety with novel anti -HER2 agents need to be interpreted with 
caution because the trials are conducted in carefully selected populations . 
  
 Current clinic al recommendations  
Current FDA prescribing information recommends the confirmation of a normal LVEF prior to 
starting lapatinib. While on treatment, patients who develop an asymptomatic drop in LVEF 
below 50%, defined as grade 2 or greater by [CONTACT_78182] (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, or drop in LVEF below the institution’s lower limit of normal, should have lapatinib discontinued. It may be restarted at a 
reduced dose (1,000 mg/day) after a minimum of 2 weeks if the LVEF recovers to normal and 
the patient is asymptomatic.  
 Regarding pertuzumab and ado- trastuzumab emtansine, the package insert recommends  to 
acess LVEF prior to initiation of these agents and at regular  intervals (e.g., every three months). 
In addition it should only be administered to patients with LVEF within nor mal limits and  held if 
there is a drop in LVEF to less than 40% or LVEF of 40% - 45% with ≥10% absolute decrease 
below pretreatment values .

Detection of cardiac toxicity  
 
 Echocardiogram with Strain  analysis  
Traditionally, trastuzumab- associated  cardiac toxicity has been identified through assessment of 
LVEF by [CONTACT_289886] (ERNA), more commonly known as  multi-
gated acquisition ( MUGA ), or by 2D echocardiography. Clinical trials used different LVEF criteria 
for enrollment (most commonly LVEF >50% or institution’s lower limit of normal) as well as 
holding and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_289843]. However, both standard echocardiography 
and MUGA scanning  have limitations and neither is able to detect cardiac dysfunction prior to the 
reduction in LVEF, which represents a late stage of drug -related cardiac toxicity.  
 
Myocardial strain is a new echocardiographic measure of cardiac contractility that offers the 
potential to detect subtle, early signs of cardiac dysfunction22. Among trastuzumab- treated 
patients, early decline in myocardial strain has been shown to predict  subsequent decline in 
LVEF23-25. Sawaya et al prospectively evaluated [ADDRESS_353544]  cancer patients receiving adjuvant 
trastuz umab and found that a decrease in global longitudinal strain after 3 months of therapy 
was an independent predictor of cardiac toxicity after 6 months of therapy23. This was confirmed  
in the follow -up multicenter study by [CONTACT_289887] 81 women treated with 
anthracyclines followed by [CONTACT_289888]
24.  
 
 
 Troponins  
Cardiac troponins (cTns) are structural proteins unique to the heart and their detection in peripheral blood indicates cardiac damage. cTnI is an established clinical marker for the 
diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. cTnI has also been used in patients with cancer 
undergoing high- dose chemotherapy w here it predicted subsequent development of cardiac 
dysfunction
26. Recently developed, “highly- sensitive cTn assays” (hs -cTnT) differ from 
“standard” clinically -used cTn assays in their ability to detect positive levels in the maj ority of 
healthy patients and in their acceptable imprecision (coefficient of variation <10%) at the 99th 
percentile of a normal reference population27. The [COMPANY_002] Diagnostics hs -cTnT has been tested 
in several large cardiovascular cohorts where it predicted future cardiovascular events including 
heart failure events as well as overall mortality28,29. The results of these studies suggest that hs -
cTnT assays may have a role in detecting subclinical cardiac dysfunction and assessing the 
cardiovascular risk in the general population .  
 
 
 Stages of development of HF and recommended therapy by [CONTACT_289889] a complex clinical syndrome that can result from any structural or functional cardiac 
disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill with or eject blood. The cardinal manifestations of HF are dyspnea and fatigue, which may limit exercise tolerance, and fluid 
retention, which may lead to pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema.  Clinical guidelines 
recommend using classified stages of development of HF that can guide appropriate therapy for each stage
30. Patients at high risk for HF but without structural heart disease or symptoms of HF 
are classified as stage A. Patients receiving chemotherapy agents that are known to affect the 
heart function, such as anthracyclines or trastuzumab, fall into this category. Stage B includes 
patients with structural heart disease but without signs or symptoms of HF, such as patients with 
asymptomatic LV dysfunction or patients with valvular heart disease. Stage C includes patients 
with curre nt or past symptoms of HF and stage D designates patients with refractory HF who 
might be eligible for advanced treatment strategies31.  
 
9 
  
The goal of  therapy for patients in stage A is to treat hypertension, encourage smoking 
cessation, treat lipid disorders, encourage regular exercise, discourage alcohol intake or illicit 
drug use, as well as control of metabolic syndrome if present. Patients in stage B, in addition to 
all the above measures, are recommended to receive ACE inhibitors or angiotensin -recepto r 
blockers (ARB), and beta- blockers (B -Blockers), if no contraindications31. Treatment with ACE 
inhibitors  is supported by [CONTACT_289890][INVESTIGATOR_289844], whether due to a remote ischemic injury or to a  
nonischemic cardiomyopathy32,33. Importantly, in a randomized trial that included patients at 
high-risk for HF but without LV dysfunction, defined as LVEF<40%, ramipril reduced the risk of 
HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289845]34. There are no studies that specifically address  the use of 
ARBs in  asymptomatic patients with reduced LVEF but the results of  studies in s ymptomatic 
patients with low EF suggest that  ARBs may be  an appropriate alternative, particularly in 
patients who cannot  tolerate ACE  inhibitors 35,36.  
 
The use of different B -Blockers in patients with low EF has been supported by [CONTACT_289891], as well  as in asymptomatic patients with LV dysfunction 
following myocardial infarction37-40. Studies that compared different BB strategies suggest that 
carvedilol may be superior to metoprolol in patients in producing greater beneficial effects on left 
ventricul ar ejection fraction when given in similar doses that were used in clinical trials40,41.  
  
 Cardiac therapy in prevention and treatment of cardiotoxicity associated with trastuzumab  
Both ACE inhibitors and B -Blocker s have been successfully used in the treatment and 
prevention of anthracycline- induced cardiotoxicity42-44. Two retrospective studies provide insight 
on LV dysfunction and response to cardiac treatment in the setting of trastuzumab therapy. A single institution report  from MD Anderson Cancer Center describes experience with [ADDRESS_353545] HF treatment with an ACE inhibitor and B -Blocker  that were given 
at the discretion of the treating physician. Important findings of this study included an increase in 
LVEF in the majority of patients following the discontinuation of trastuzumab, as well as the 
feasibility of  trastuzumab -rechallenge in a significant number of patients (66%) who had had 
prior favorable oncological response to trastuzumab and who experienced a period of stability of LV function and absence of symptoms
45. The second study from the same institution 
retrospectively looked at 173 patients who received trastuzumab over a period of 5 years and reported cardiac events (including symptoms of HF and asymptomatic decreases in LVEF) in 44 
(28%) patients, HF symptoms in 15 (8%) and one cardiac death. That investigation also 
reported recovery of LVEF and resolution of symptoms with discontinuation of trastuzumab and 
start of cardiac treatment in the majority of patients
46.  
There are no prospective trials that addres s the role of specific HF treatment choice, B-B lockers  
or ACE inhibitors, in trastuzumab- induced LV dysfunction. In addition, the majority of the 
patients in the trastuzumab trials had also received prior anthracycline treatment thus making it challenging to separate the effec ts of anthracyclines and trastuzumab and the cardiac treatment 
effects
47,48. 
  
 
 
  
[ADDRESS_353546] earlier patients more 
likely to develop cardiac events or asymptomatic further worsening of cardiac function induced 
by [CONTACT_94970]2 targeted therapy: 1) myocardial strain analysis 2) cTnI and hs -cTnT.  Earlier detection 
of these patients may allow consideration of alternative oncological treatments and/or different 
cardiac prevention strategies in these patients to prevent progressive LV dys function.  
 
With the results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we plan to proceed to a phase II trial that would support a 
change in the current recommendations regarding the initial recommendations regarding cardiac function and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_289846]2 targeted therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014].

4.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_289848] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_289849]’s choice HER2 targeted 
therapy  (non-lapatinib)  in [ADDRESS_353549] cancer and mildly 
decreased LV function (LVEF ≥40% and <50%)  while on concomitant cardiac treatment with B -
Blockers and ACE inhibitors .  
 
Sample size 
We will use a sample size of 30 patients  determined based on the primary endpoint of therapy 
completion (see Section 9.0). In addition, we will estimate the rate of cardiac events and 
asymptomatic worsening of LV function with a 90% confidence interval. To achieve this goal we 
will add 10% of patients to our sample size to account for potential drop out before starting 
HER2 targeted therapy. Therefore we will plan to enroll [ADDRESS_353550] been "pre -screened" by [CONTACT_289893] 40 and 49%, we dont expect that we 
will have a very high screening failure. We anticipate that we may screen [ADDRESS_353551] 
3 months of HER2 targeted therapy  (non-lapatinib) . Patients will be candidates for trastuzumab, 
pertuzumab/trastuzumab or ado -trastuzumab emtansine at the discretion of their treating 
oncologist, alone or in combination with other sys temic treatment or radiation.  
 
Patients included will either be found to have mildly decreased LVEF at the initial 
echocardiogram prior to HER2 targeted therapy or will have developed mildly reduced EF while receiving HER2 targeted therapy. This will class ify the majority of the participants as stage B in 
the stages of development of HF
31 (appendix B).  Patients who have a remote history of 
symptomatic HF, i.e. more than one year prior to study enrollment, will be considered for the study and based on the HF guidelines they would be classified as stage C HF. While this 
[ADDRESS_353552] for evaluation of 
symptoms and signs of heart failure and for initiation and/or titration of cardiac medications (B-
blockers and ACE inhibitors) .  
 
A schema will be followed to determine when HER2 targeted therapy should be held, when it 
may be rechallenged and when it must be stopped (figure 1). If at any time the patient develops 
symptomatic  heart failure confirmed by [CONTACT_72324], the patient will go off study.  
 
A blood specimen will be collected at baseline and stored for potential analysis of targets identified in the future.  
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_353553] Selection and Screening  
 
Patients who meet eligibility criteria (page 14) and sign informed consent will be registered for 
screening and assigned an ID number. All protocol -specific screening procedures must be 
performed within 30 days after  signing informed consent.  The decision about the need to Patient meets eligibility 
criteria for screening  Screening /Preenrollment 
Procedures  Treatment Phase  
Screen Failures  Informed Consent  Study Enrollment  
[ADDRESS_353554].  
 
Assessments performed exclusively to determine eligibility for this study will be done only after obtaining informed consent. Assessments performed for clinical indications (not 
exclusively to determine study eligibility) may be used for screening or other study 
purposes so long as they are done within 30 days prior to signing the consent.  Screening 
and enrollment case report forms (CRFs) should be filled at this point (appendices K -L). 
 
 
5.1.1 Screening Procedures: 
 
• Screening study echocardiogram confirmation by [CONTACT_87904] (appendix I)  
• Cardiac questionnaire (appendix E ) 
• EKG  
• Six minute walk test  
• Laboratory work:  
o Troponin I (Tn -I) 
o Pregnancy test  
• Additional laboratory work if clinically indicated:  
o BNP or NT proBNP 
o Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) including  albumin, alkaline phosphatase, 
ALT/sGPT, AST/sGOT, BUN, creatini ne, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, 
bicarbonat e, glucose, and total bilirubin;   
o Fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and HDL cholesterol) for 
those who are on lipid- lowering agents  
o Hemoglobin A1c   
o Thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH) and fr ee T4 
o Serum free ferritin 
• Exercise stress e chocardiogram (if considered appropriate by [CONTACT_289894]) 
• Summary of initial cardiac assessment (appendix G)  
• Oncology Visit  
• Cardiology Visit  
 
After signing the consent patient will undergo additional protocol -specific screening procedures 
to exclude presence of coronary ischemia  or other treatable causes of cardiomyopathy.  If 
ischemia is suspected patients will not be enrolled in the study unless the results of further, 
more specific i schemia work -up, excludes presence of ischemia. The results of the tests and 
procedures, such as lab tests or cardiac imaging, performed for clinical indications prior to 
signing of the consent may be used at the discretion of study investigators.  
 
Coronary artery disease is believed to be the underlying cause in approximately two thirds of 
patients with HF and low EF and also contributes to the progression of HF through mechanisms that include endothelial dysfunction, ischemia and infarction. The decision about the need to 
perform an exercise stress echocardiogram or other test to exclude myocardial ischemia will be made at the discretion of the treating study cardiologist. Patients who undergo a stress test and 
are found to have positive test, i.e. wall motion abnormality with stress consistent with ischemia, 
will be excluded from the study and will pursue further clinically -indicated work -up and treatment 
16 
  
that may include cardiac catheterization and revascularization. If findings of the further work -up 
are negative and no ischemia is found, or the patient is revascularized, she/he may be re -
considered for the study if anti -HER2 treatment is still indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_289850]. For patients who had a prior stress test or other ischemia evaluation the results of 
these tests will be reviewed by a study cardiologist who will make a decision about whether 
repeat stress echocardiogram or other cardiac ischemia evaluation is needed.  
 
If a patient cannot complete exercise stress test,  for example,  because of the inability to walk on 
the treadmill, the need for further ischemia work -up will be decided by [CONTACT_289895], presence of symptoms, as well as the results of 
EKG, troponin, and presence of wall motion abnormalities on 2D echocardiogram. This work -up 
may include pharmacological stress testing (for example, dobutamine stress echocardiogram  or 
regadenoson perfusion study by [CONTACT_289896]), cardiac CT or coronary angiogram. Patient may 
be enrolled in the study if: a) further stress testing is considered not necessary given low risk for 
ischemia or b) the results of the performed functional or anatomical test are negative for 
significant ischemia or significant coronary disease.  
Thyroid function and serum free ferritin will be performed for clinical indications according to the 
American College of Cardiologists (ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) Practice Guideline 
recommendations to exclude possible treatable causes of LV dysfunction. Work -up for other 
systemic conditions such as hemochromatosis,  rheumatologic disease, sleep- disturbed 
breathing or human- immunodeficiency virus infection will be assessed as clinically indicated. 
 Standard cTnI will be collected as a screening procedure for each patient. If the results of the 
standard cTnI assay are > 1ng/ml, the results of the stress test will be reviewed and the patient 
will be scheduled for a clinical visit and appropriate clinical work -up will be initiated.  Until further 
work up is completed and troponin ≤ 1ng/ml, the patient will not participate in the study. If 
exercise stress echocardiogram result is normal, patients may be allowed to participate in the study. This decision will be made by [CONTACT_289897].  
 
5.1.2 Screen Failure:  
 
The follo wing instances will be considered a screen failure:  
 
• Study echocardiogram doesn’t confirm LVEF reported in initial echocardiogram (LVEF<50% 
and >40%)  
• Presence of treatable and reversible HF cause as assessed by [CONTACT_289898] (for 
example, hyperthyroidism)  
• Presence of ischemia (as assessed by [CONTACT_289898])  
• Positive pregnancy test.  Patients of childbearing potential must have negative urine or 
serum pregnancy test within 21 days after signing initial consent . 
 
After completion of all screening procedures, patients unable to continue will be considered 
screen failures. Patients able to continue the study , i.e., did not meet any screen failure criteria, 
will enroll and move to the treatment phase.

pressure and other clinical characteristics. For patients with bradycardia  (heart rate < 60) beta -
blocker will not be started and ACE -inhibitor will be considered as the first choice.  Carvedilol will 
be initiated with the starting dose of 3.125 mg twice a day  with dose increases as tolerated.  In 
patients who already take different beta-b lockers for the treatment of blood pressure or other 
reasons their beta-blockers will be substituted for a corresponding dose of carvedilol. In the 
absence of hypotension (symptoms of lightheadedness or BP < 100/60 mmHg), or bradycardia 
(heart rate <60 bpm) the dose of carvedilol will be increased at weekly intervals up to 25 mg 
twice daily (Figure 3). If the titration is not possible due to hypotension or bradycardia the patient 
will be kept on the same dose and re -evaluated in two weeks for titration. Carvedilol will be our 
beta-b locker of choice because it has been showed to have beneficial effects in patients with 
chronic HF as well as benefit over metoprolol tartarate49. 
  Once a patient reaches the maximum tolerated dose of carvedilol twice daily, ramipril will 
be added at 1.25mg daily dose. Ramipril dose will be doubled approximately every 3 weeks to coincide with infusion center visits for HER2 targeted therapy, assuming a 3 week treatment 
schedule. It will be uptitrated to the maximum tolerated dose, up to a maximum dose of 10mg.  Patients who are on different ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril and enalapril, for the treatment 
of blood pressure or other causes, will be continued.  Figure 3 is representative of events in patients not on beta -blocker, ACE inhibitor or ARB at the time of study entry and who are able to 
tolerate increases in beta- blockers and addition ACE inhibitor without low blood pressure, 
bradycardia and/or other side effects. 
 
 In patients who have a history of allergy or intolerance to ACE inhibitors, angiotensin 
receptor blockers (ARBs) will be started instead of ACE inhibitors. Candesartan will be 
considered as the first ARB of choice. Other approved ARBs can be used depending on clinical 
circumstances or insurance coverage at the discretion of study cardiologist. If the patients are 
already on valsartan or other approved ARBs, their dose will be continued and up titrated as 
tolerated.  
 
 Patients will not receive ACE inhibitors, B- blockers or ARBs if they have known allergy to 
any of these classes of drugs, history of bronchial asthma or related bronchospastic conditions, hereditary or idiopathic angioedema or history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to drugs or 
other causes, i.e. bee stings.  If a patient can’t receive any of the cardiac medications due to any contraindication, patient can still participate in the study. If for any reason a patient is unable 
to receive the choice ACE -inhibitor or/and B -blocker, appropriate substitutions will be made 
according to study cardiologist.  
 
 Patients with baseline creatinine of equal or more than 1.5 mg/dl will not initiate ACE 
inhibitors or ARBs but they will be allowed to participate in the study. Serum creatinine level will 
be assessed after the first dose of either ACE inhibitor or ARB and following after every dose 
increase, until creatinine levels is stable defined as less than 10% change from baseline 
creatinine. If there is an increase of serum creatinine of more than 0.5mg/dL from baseline, the medication will not be increased further and serum creatinine will be repeated.. If the creatinine 
continues to be elevated to more than 30% of baseline value the dose will be reduced or, if the 
patient is on the lowest dose, the medication will be stopped.  
 
Other M edications  
Patients’ medications will be reviewed during initial cardiac assessment and the following drugs 
that can exacerbate or provoke the syndrome of HF will be discontinued and/or replaced with 
alternative agents as possible. These drugs include calcium channel blockers (all with the 
19 
  
exception of amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_289851]), antiarrhythmic agents and nonsteroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs (all with the exception of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]).  
 
If patient does not meet his/her LDL goal based on standard NCEP/ATP (National Cholesterol 
Education Program/ Adult Treatment Panel) guidelines and is not on statin therapy, atorvastatin 
will be initiated accord ing to the standard clinical practice. In patient who require either new 
initiation of statin therapy or dose escalation, lipid profile will be repeated in [ADDRESS_353555].  
 
 
Blood pressure log  
  Patients will be instructed to take their blood pressure (BP) every day during the first 
month or until maximum tolerated cardiac medication dose is achieved. Patients will be provided with a BP monitor cuff and taught how to use it. After that, patients will be instructed to take their 
BP weekly while participating in the study. BP results will be documented on a BP Daily Log 
(appendix T). In case the patient cannot adequately learn how to monitor his BP at home, she/he will come once a week to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289852], for the first month 
or until maximum tolerated dose of cardiac medications has been achieved. After that blood 
pressure will be checked at routine study visits.  
  The titration of the medications will be pursued based on the results of the BP daily log. 
As an example, if there are no values of systolic blood pressure of less than 100 mmHg and the 
median weekly systolic BP is >110mmHg  the medication will be up titrated according to the 
schema in figure 3. Otherwise patients will be continued on the current dose of medication. In case of symptoms of lightheadedness or 2 or more values of systolic blood pressure of less 
than 100 mmHg, the dose of medication will be reduced or stopped if the patient is one the minimal dose. If a patient cannot check the blood pressure at home she/he will come for the BP 
appointment.  
  
On Study Cardiac Visits 
 
After receiving the first dose of HER2 targeted therapy while on study,  patients will come for 
cardiology follow up assessments (appendix I) every six weeks (+/ - 10 days) for a total of 2 
visits and then every twelve weeks ( +/- 10 days). Medical  history and physical exam will be 
performed at each follow up cardiac assessment visit. Echocardiogram and laboratory testing including other serum chemistries and BNP may be performed at cardiologist‘s discretion if 
there is a concern for HF signs and symptoms based on the review of systems and physical 
exam during the follow -up assessment visit.  
The treating physicians will have access to the LVEF assessed by [CONTACT_289899]. (see [IP_ADDRESS])  
Criteria for withholding HER2 targeted therapy will  be followed according to Figure 1. If a patient 
has an asymptomatic absolute decline in LVEF of >10% points from baseline or to equal or less 
than 35%, HER2 targeted therapy will be temporarily held. At any time that HER2 targeted 
therapy is withheld, the  patient will undergo follow up cardiology assessment  to evaluate for the 
presence of HF signs and symptoms. Further testing including chest X -ray, echocardiogram and 
laboratory testing will be done at the discretion of the cardiologist.  
20 
  
Confirmatory study echocardiogram will be performed within 2- 4 weeks (Figure 1). If repeated 
study echocardiogram confirms the change in LVEF that meets holding criteria, patient will 
come off the study. This will be named asympt omatic worsening of cardiac function and 
considered a primary endpoint.  However, if repeated echocardiogram shows improvement in 
LVEF and holding criteria are not further met, HER2 targeted therapy will be resumed and 
patient will undergo regular cardiac assessments and study echocardiograms every 6 weeks for 
two times and then every 12 weeks. Dose reduction will not be considered for any of the HER2 
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_289853].  
 If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of HF, he/she will undergo follow -up cardiac 
assessment. If patient presents with symptoms mandating urgent medical evaluation (worsening 
dyspnea, hemodynamic compromise), he/she will be directed to the nearest emergency room or a tertiary acute care center. HER2 targeted therapy will be temporarily held in any patient who 
develops clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of HF until cardiology assessment. If 
symptoms are confirmed to be due to HF, the patient will be taken off the study. At the time of any cardiac event, any grade 3 or 4 adverse event will be collected (Appendix S).  
 Adverse events related to cardiac medications (B -Blockers, ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs) will be 
treated at the discretion of the treating cardiologist. 
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Echocardiograms  
 
Screening Echocardiogram : 
 
Patients will be initia lly identified based on LVEF (< 50% and ≥ 40%) detected in a routine 
clinical echocardiogram. If LVEF was assessed using different cardiac imaging modality 
(cardiac MR or radionuclide imaging (MUGA)) the same LVEF criteria will apply for 
determination of eligibility (< 50% and ≥ 40%). Patients will sign consent and will undergo 
screening procedures.  
LVEF value will be confirmed through the MedStar Health Research Institute Cardiovascular 
Ultrasound Core Laboratory (Core Lab) LVEF assessment. Clinical echoc ardiogram that was 
used to obtain eligibility will be sent to the Core Lab labeled with the subject’s Study ID, Date of Study and Time Interval. If the images of the clinical echocardiogram used to determine 
eligibility are not available, or LVEF was obtained using different cardiac imaging technique, the 
patient will undergo a new study echocardiogram in this period.  
 
Baseline and Subsequent Study Echocardiogram:  
 “Screening” echocardiogram may be used as a baseline study echocardiogram if the study is available and fulfills the following: it was completed within 30 days prior to study enrollment, it 
includes raw frequency data (for strain assessment) and all the measurements listed in the Echocardiography protocol (Appendix H) are included and are evaluable as determined by [CONTACT_289900]. 
 
21 
  
Study echocardiograms will be performed at clinical echocardiography laboratories following the 
Echoc ardiography protocol (Appendix H) and will include transthoracic echocardiogram s with 
strain analysis, 2D and 3D measure ments. The echocardiograms will be sent for  interpret ation, 
electronically or using a DVD copy, to the MHRI’s Cardiovascular Core lab .  
 
The echocardiograms will be performed at baseline and after starting HER2 therapy every 6 
weeks for 2 assessments and then every 3 months while on study. Additional echocardiograms 
may be performed at the discretion of study investigators  to evaluate changes in cardiac 
function while patients is on study. These echocardiograms will be paid by [CONTACT_289901], for example, suspected symptoms of HF.  
 
All echocardiograms need to be scheduled with enough time prior to the next dose of 
HER2 targeted therapy  to allow image transfer, processing and reporting from the Core 
Lab. 
The echocardiograms will be labeled as:  
 
- Study ID, Date of Study and Time interval : 
-Screening 
-Baseline (as above, screening echo may qualify for baseline)  
-6 weeks  
-12 weeks (3 months)  
-24 weeks  (6 months)  
-36 weeks (9 months)  
-48 weeks (12 months)  
-Off Study   
-[ADDRESS_353556]  Off Study  
-Other: Clinical (for additional echocardiograms ordered at discretion of study 
investigators  due to change in clinical status),  
-Other: Safety Check 1 etc (additional echocardiograms ordered for subjects whose EF 
has dropped as per protocol parameters ) 
 
In the case of treatment  delay , both weeks and cycles follow the infusion of HER2 therapy. 
Therefore, 3 weeks corresponds to cycle 1 etc.  
 
 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Transfering and Core Lab Reporting of Study 
Echocardiograms  
 
Echocardiographic images will be transferred digitally or recorded on a DVD and 
brought/shipped to the Core Lab.  Core Lab perso nnel will be notified of image transfer and will 
be provided with the Study label including Study ID, Date of Study and Time Interval as above.  
 
Case report form (CRF, Appendix  I) will be sent back to the research coordinator within 72 
business hours from the time the Core Lab receives the study images and the notification with 
Study label. Scheduling of echocardiograms will be done in accordance to this timing.  
 
LVEF reported in the CRF will be used for decision making in the study in the following fashion:  
-  If 3D measurement LVEF is available it will be used as LVEF of record for that study,  
-  if 3D measurement is not available, 2D LVEF will be used,  
[ADDRESS_353557] include:  
 
• TNM staging  
• ER, PR, HER2 s tatus  
• Previous treatments received for breast cancer: radiation,  surgery, chemotherapy, 
endocrine or targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
• Performance status (appendix C)  
 
CRF on previous hormonal and chemotherapy agents received, radiation therapy and previous 
breast surgery will be filled by [CONTACT_289902] (Appendices N-Q). In this initial oncological assessment, the planned oncologic therapy will be defined by [CONTACT_289903] (appendix N).  
 
Patients will receive one of the three following HER2 targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_289854]: trastuzumab, trastuzumab/pertuzumab or ado- trastuzumab emtansine. These will be 
administered on an outpatient basis. The first dose of HER2 targeted therapy will be initiated 
after BB +/ - ACE inhibitor doses have been optimized at the discretion of one of the study 
cardiologists. Supportive care medications such as anti -emetics, growth factors and medications

Agents  Indication, d osage, route of administration, cycle length  
Trastuzumab  For intravenous (IV) infusion only. Do not administer as an IV push or 
bolus. Administer at either: Initial dose of 4 mg/kg over 90 minute IV 
infusion, then 2 mg/kg over 30 minute IV infusion weekly for 52 weeks, 
or initial dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion, then 6 mg/kg over 
30−[ADDRESS_353558] dose was given less than 6 
weeks prior.  
Ado-trastuzumab 
emtansine  3.6mg/kg IV every three wee ks. The first infusion will be administered 
over 90 minutes ( ± 10 minutes). Following the first dose, patients will be 
observed for at least 60 minutes for fever, chills, or other infusion-
associated symptoms. If prior infusions were well tolerated, subseq uent 
doses of ado- trastuzumab emtansine may b e administered over 30 
minutes (± 10 minutes), with a minimum 30- minute observation period 
after infu sion.  
 
 
Screening and Off Study evaluations are required. Other oncology visits will be at the discretion 
of the treating oncologist. Routine laboratory studies required to evaluate oncologic therapy-
related, non -cardiac toxicity are at the discretion of the treating oncologist and, therefore, have 
not been specified in the protocol. Restaging scans will be performed as needed at the discretion of the treating oncologist. Appropriate form with information from each patient 
regarding ongoing HER2 targeted therapy, dose and days of treatment, concomitant 
chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and/or radiation therapy will be filled by [CONTACT_093] 
(appendix AA).  
 
Dose reductions for trastuzumab and pertuzumab will not be allowed. Ado- trastuzumab 
emtansine dose can be reduced to 3.0 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg, in case of  throm bocytopenia, 
hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity  or other toxicities , and will be at discretion of the treating oncologist.  
 
For delayed or missed doses, if the time between [ADDRESS_353559] been associated with both cardiac (see section 6.3.1) and non -

[ADDRESS_353560]. If HER2 targeted therapy 
is held  for non -cardiac reasons for more than 9 weeks (more than 3 cycles of HER2 targeted 
therapy), patient will go off study.  
 
 
   6.4  Treatment delays  
  
Cardiac assessments (echocardiogram, cardiology visit and blood samples) are done in accordance with administration of HER2 targeted therapy. Treatment delays will be 
documented. If HER2 therapy is on hold for more than [ADDRESS_353561]

at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative reasons. The 
reason(s) for discontinuation will be documented and may include: 
6.6.1 Patient voluntarily withdraws from treatment (follow -up permitted);  
6.6.2  Patient withdraws consent (termination of treatment and follow -up); 
6.6.3  Patient is unable to comply with protocol requirements;  
6.6.4  Treating physician judges continuation on the study would not be in the patient’s best interest;  
6.6.5  Patient becomes pregnant (pregnancy to be reported along same 
timelines as a serious adverse event);  
6.6.[ADDRESS_353563] to follow -up; 
6.6.7    Completion of planned course of HER2 targeted therapy; 
6.6.8  Cardiac event or asymptomatic worsening of cardiac function as defined 
in protocol that preclude continuation of patient participation in the study;  
6.6.[ADDRESS_353564]. Patients who 
complete their curren t HER2 targeted therapy regimen will be taken off the study prior to 12 
months of follow -up. For the normal course of the study, completion of planned course of HER2 
targeted therapy will mark the end of treatment. However, if patients experience a Cardiac event 
or asymptomatic worsening of cardiac function (as defined in protocol) that precludes 
continuation of patient participation in the study, then this event will mark the end of treatment.  
 
  
5.8 Off Study P rocedures  
 
• Complete medical history and physical exam  
• Troponin I , hs troponin  
• Study echocardiogram

being treated in the adjuvant setting. If they are being treated in the metastatic setting they may 
continue to receive HER2 targeted therapy after the study is finished. All patients will be 
followed for 6 months after being off study. Cardiac medications will be continued at the 
discretion of the treating physicians. Cardiac events occurring during this period of 6 months will 
be recorded and considered as possibly related to HER2 targeted therapy, independently of 
whether HER2 targeted therapy is continued off study. All the patients  will be reevaluated in a 
single visit at 6 months (+/ - 10 days) with:  
 
• Complete history and physical exam  
• Study echocardiogram  ([ADDRESS_353566] Off Study)  
• Lipid profile for patients who were started on a lipid lowering agent while on the study  
• Troponin I , hs troponin

adverse events (SAEs); measurement of protocol -specified vital signs; and other protocol -
specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drugs.  
 
The Sponsors or their designee are responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the Competent 
Authority, other applicable regulatory authorities, and participating investigators, in accordance

regardless of attribution.   
This includes the following:  
- AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the protocol -specified AE      
   reporting period.   
 - Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions.  
- AEs that occur prior to assignment of study  treatment that are related to a protocol     
  mandated intervention.  
 - Preexisting medical conditions  judged by [CONTACT_289904]- specified AE reporting per iod. 
 AEs attributed to ACE inhibitors and  B-blockers will be documented but not reported:

6.2 Serious adverse event  (Immediately reportable to the sponsor)  
 
An SAE is any AE that result in the following outcomes or require medical intervention to 
prevent any of these outcomes :  
- Fatal (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death, sudden cardiac death or 
death due to myocardial infarct, arrhythmia or heart failure).  If death results 
from progression of the disease, it should be reported as a SAE.  
- Life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at immediate risk of death at the time of the event)  
- Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
- Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) . 
- A congenital anomaly/birth defect in a  neonate/infant born to a mother 
exposed to the investigational product(s) . 
28 
  
- Considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., may 
jeopardize the patient or require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above)  
- P regnancies  
 
The terms “severe” and “ serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an AE 
(as in mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache). “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on 
patient or event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
patient’s life or vital functions. Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations. Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on the eCRF.   Grading will be based on CTCAE v. 4.0.  The 
CTCAE v4.0 is available at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_353570] (Immedi ately reportable to 
the sponsor)  
 
Non-serious AEs of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_33473] (i.e., no more than 24 hours  after learning of the event ); AEs of special 
interest fo r this study include the following:  
 -     any cardiac event (CE)  defined as any of the following :  
- Presence of symptoms attributable to HF (increasing shortness of breath, 
orthopnea, PND, bilateral ankle swelling) as confirmed by a cardiologist  
- Cardiac arrhythmia requiring pharmacological or electrical treatment  
- Myocardial infarction 
 
Heart failure should be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0 for “heart failure” (Grade  2, 3, 4, 
or 5) and in addition according to the NYHA classification.  
Any CE should be reported to the Cardiac Review Panel within three weeks after learning of the CE. 
Asymptomatic declines in LVEF will  not be reported.   Exceptions to this rule are as follows:  
• An asymptomatic decline in LVEF
 ≥ 10 percentage -points from baseline to an LVEF  ≤35% 
must be reported as an AE with the term of “ejection fraction decreased” as per NCI 
CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_353571] dose of study drug. A 
Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed by [CONTACT_26819] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy).The investigator should counsel the patient, 
discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the 
29 
  
patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Any SAEs associated with the 
pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event  eCRF.  
 
 
7.4.[ADDRESS_353572] use condoms for the duration of the pregnancy. A Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed by [CONTACT_26819] (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learning of the pregnancy). Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the 
course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study drug. The pregnant partner will need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy 
Health Information to allow for follow -up on her pregnancy. Once the authorization has been 
signed, the investigator will update the Pregnancy Report eCRF with additional information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy. An investigator who is contact[CONTACT_289906], to support an informed decision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or obstetrician.  
 
6.5 Methods and timing for assessing and recording safety variables  
 The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or reported 
during the study, are collected and reported to the FDA, appropriate IRB(s), and Genentech, 
Inc. in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports).    
6.5.[ADDRESS_353573], or other means will be 
reported appropriately. Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e.,  start and 
end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the HER2 targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_289856]. 
 To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline: 
• Yes: There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and 
administration of the HER2 targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and the AE cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE 
follows a known pattern of response to the HER2 targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE abates 
30 
  
or resolves upon discontinuation of the HER2 targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_289857], if 
applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.  
• No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the HER2 targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant  
medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to HER2 targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_289858] (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_353574] dose of study drug).  
 Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in the Package Insert or current Investigator Brochure.  
 Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the Package Insert (P.I.) or current 
Investigator Brochure (I.B.) or not identified. This includes adverse events for which the 
specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in the P.I. or I.B. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the P.I. or I.B. only referred to elevated 
hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_353575] will be reported to 
the IRB at annual renewal along with all other adverse events. DSMC and IPRC reports of these 
events will be submitted to the IRB as an amendment. 
 
6.7 Expedited Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse E vents 
The Sponsors or their designee will  notify the FDA  within 7 business days of learning of any 
unexpected fatal or life -threatening adverse event with possible relationship to study drug In 
addition, the cause of death will be summarized (e.g., disease related, treatment related, other, 
unknown).  The Sponsor or their designee will notify the IRB, DSMC and Genentech of  relevant 
SAEs (i.e., death, a life -threatening experience, inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289859] /incapacity)  by a written safety report within [ADDRESS_353576] be reported whether or not considered related to the treatment under investigation.  An early report can then be followed up by a more detailed report.  The clinical course of the 
serious adverse evenrt, regardless of its relationship to the study intervention, should be 
managed according to accepted standards of medical practice.  Patients will be monitored until the SAE resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the event return to baseline; or a 
satisfactory explanation is found or the investigator considers it medically justified to terminate follow -up of the event; or death (a full pathology report shold be supplied if possible).  
 
Reports should include the following information: 
 Protocol number  
 Disease information  
 Date event occurred  
 Event grade  
 To what degree the event is related to the study intervention 
 If the event was expected

 Current condition of participant  
 Indication if participant remains on the study  
 Indicate if an amendment to protocol and/or consent is necessary  
 Indicate if the report is a follow -up to a previously submitted event report 
 
6.[ADDRESS_353577] medication information, 
the report should include the following information within the Event Description (section 5) of the 
MedWatch 3500A form:  
- Protocol description (and number, if assigned)  
- Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome if known 
- Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics

7.0 CORRELATIVES/SPECIAL STUDIES  
7.[ADDRESS_353578] cTnI assay. These results 
will be available to the treating physician but will not be used to make clinical decisions unless it 
is is more than 1ng/ml. Based on the published data50, mild elevation of troponin in patients 
receiving chemotheray is common and its prognostic significance is being investigated in this study. However, higher elevations of troponin which we arbitrarily set as troponin higher than 
1ng/ml are not expected in this patient population and may indicate presence of cardiac ischemia or an inflammatory process such as myocarditis. Therefore, if the results of the 
standard cTnI assay are higher than 1ng/ml patient will come for a clinical visit and appropriate 
clinical work -up will be initiated.   
[ADDRESS_353579] a specimen of blood at enrollment from each participant  and then at 6 weeks, 12 
weeks, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after starting HER2 therapy.  Blood specimens will 
be obtained at the same time with the samples for cardiac troponin and/or clinical laboratory. 
Whole blood will be collected and processed within 24h to separate the buffy coat from the 
plasma and RBCs. Buffy coat and plasma will be frozen at -80°C and processed for DNA or 
biomarkers at a later date. Serum samples will be processed, aliquoted and frozen at --80°C for 
analysis at a later day.  
 After enrollment, and if patient accepts to have collected blood for future analysis, approximately 
16 ml of blood will be collected for research (storage for future analysis and troponins) and 
approximately  15ml for clinical labs. At week 6, 12, 24, [ADDRESS_353580] their 
blood collected and stored for future analysis can still participate in the study.   
 
 
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Two-stage design, Sample Size, Accrual and Study Duration  
 
The study is designed to assess the rate of completion of planned oncology therapy in th e 
absence of cardiac event and asymptomatic worsening of cardiac function. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who completed planned oncologic  therapy without 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a cardiac  event or asymptomatic worsening of cardiac function.  
 There is no data about the current proportion of patients with low LVEF who are being treated 
with HER2 targeted therapy but we estimate to be fewer than 10% based on current clinical 
recommendations.  We consider that if 30% or more of patients will be able to safely receive 
HER2 targeted therapy despi[INVESTIGATOR_289860]. Therefore we defined a completion rate of  30% as 
considered of clinical relevance, where as a completion rate is of 10% is considered similar to the current practice.  
[ADDRESS_353581] 
30% versus it is below 10% with 80% power at a significance level of 5%51,52. This multistage 
design has operating properties similar to that of the Simon’s two- stage designs but this two 
stage design offers flexibility in monitoring and interim analysis should the planned schedule be 
variated. Morevoer it allows an early assessment of statistical evidence for both efficacy and futility, and provides a discordance probability that early trend could be reversed should the trial 
continue to to enroll all [ADDRESS_353582] stage, 15 patients will be entered. If one or more 
patient complete therapy in the absence of cardiac event, then an additional 15 patients will be 
enrolled in the second stage; If none of the [ADDRESS_353583] stage complete the therapy, 
we will conclude that the therapy is not feasible in this patient population. The protocol will be amended. The chance for a reversal of the conclusion either for efficacy or for futility based on 
this decision rule is less than 2% (the discordance probability). At the completion of the second 
stage, if more than [ADDRESS_353584] 80% probability to consider the therapy as beneficial to this 
patient population with reduced LVEF if the true completion rate is indeed 30% and 5% probability to consider this therapy as beneficial if the completetion rate is indeed only 10% or 
below.   Exact binomial calculations were used.  The intention- to-treat (ITT) population of this trial 
will be composed of patients who are actually enrolled and received at least one dose of HER2 targeted therapy since they are on study. 
 
CE is defined as any of the following :  
- Presence of symptoms attributable to HF (increasing shortness of breath, 
orthopnea, PND, bilateral ankle swelling) as confirmed by a cardiologist  
- Cardiac arrhythmia requiring pharmacological or electrical treatment  
- Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54692] a cardiovascular cause, e.g. myocardial infarction  
- Sudden cardiac death or death due to myocardial infarct, arrhythmia or HF  
  
We estimate there will be no more than 10% cardiac event s by [CONTACT_24473] 6 based on Tarantini et 
al
53. With 30 patients we will be able to estimate the cardiac event rate within 13% accuracy at a 
confidence level of 95%, or estimate it within 11% accuracy at a confidence level of 90%.  We 
will plan to enroll additional 10% of our sample size (N=3) to account for patients that will drop 
out after enrollment and before receiving any HER2 targeted therapy.   
 We anticipate to accrue [ADDRESS_353585] 
enough accrual among the two institutions (MWHC and MGUH), we plan to expand the study to 
other institutions that have the capability of performing echocardiograms with strain analysis. 
The accrual period is expected to be approximately [ADDRESS_353586] confidence interval of 
the completion rate  based on binomial calculation  will be obtained. We estimate there will be no 
more than 10% cardiac events.  
 
34 
  
The outliers and data errors will be checked. Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize 
the demographic profile of the subjects. Frequency and percentages will be used to summarize 
categorical variables. Mean (SD) or median (interquartile range) based on the normalization of 
the data will be used to summarize continuous variables.  
 
The incidence of CEs and asymptomatic worsening of cardiac function during study treatment will be calculated, as well as time to CEs and asymptomatic worsening of cardiac function. Due 
to the expected small number of subjects with incident CE, descriptive statistics and graphical analyses will be used to assess the difference between those with and without cardiac 
dysfunction. W e will  calculate the mean (SD) of the strain, cTn I and hs -cTn T at each time 
point and graphically assess these measures over time in patients that had an event and that did not have an event. Difference (95% CI) in mean of the strain, cTn I and hs -cTn T between 
those with and without incident CE event at each time point will be calculated. The mean change in strain, cTn I and hs -cTn T from baseline to each follow -up point will be calculated in 
those with and without incident CE. Generalized linear model will be utilized for the correlativ e 
analysis of completion rate and cardiac event s. The longitudinal generalized linear model will be 
used to assess the serial strain, cTn I and hs -cTn T measures with the clinical outcomes 
(completion rate and cardiac event s). These analyses will most like ly be in a pai rwise fashion 
given the moderate sample size.  
 
8.2.1 Interim Analysis:  
The study has a two- stage design. There will be an interim analysis after enroll ment of 50% of 
the patients. The interim analysis plan is contained in 9.1 two stage design desc ription.  
 
 
8.2.2 Safety Analysis:   
All subjects who have received treatment will be in the safety analysis. All adverse events will 
be summarized in terms of frequency, severity and relatedness to the study treatment. At the end of the study, the cumulative incidences of adverse events will be calculated.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_353587] binomial 90% CI would be 0 to 9.48%. Thus we feel confident that the true cardiac death rate in this population is less than 
10%. The probability of observing at least one cardiac death, for a range of true underlying 
rates, is summarized in Table 4, indicating for example, that if the true cardiac death rate is as high as 10% then the study has a 0.96 probability of observing one or more when 30 patients 
are treated, and even if as high as 5% there is  a 0.79 probability of having observed one or 
more.  
 
If we don’t observe  any cardiac death, then the likelihood that the true rate is 10%, is extremely 
low.

If 3 patients experience symptoms of HF (increasing shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, bilateral ankle swelling) and confirmed by [CONTACT_72324], then the trial will be terminated. 
Adjuvant phase III clinical trials reported an incidence of HF that ranged from 2.1 %
 (BCIRG0067, 
only grade 3/4 reported) to 4% (NSABP at 7y15). In a retrospective study with patients at a 
higher cardiovascular risk, a rate of 9% of symptomatic HF was reported54. Based on these 
reports, we will accept a rate of less than 10% for  events of symptomatic HF, which represents 
less than [ADDRESS_353589] binomial 90% CI would be (2.78% to 23.85%). The probability of observing 3 or more 
symptomatic HF events, for a range of true underlying rates, is summarized in Table 5 , 
indicating for example, that if the true rate is as high as 10% then the study has a 0.59 
probability of observing three or more when 30 patients are treated, and if as high as 15% there is a 0.[ADDRESS_353590] three symptomatic HF events, for a range of true

9.0 DATA SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE AND  CARDIAC REVIEW 
PANEL 
9.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  
 
As this study is an investigator initiated study utilizing FDA approved agents it is considered a moderate risk study which requires real -time monitoring by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_289861] -
annual reviews by [CONTACT_289907] (DSM C). 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_79761]- Investigators will review the data including safety 
monitoring  at weekly disease group meetings and on monthly network disease group 
teleconferences .  The investigators shall meet regularly  to review toxicities and follow up on 
results of patients enrolled on the study. 
Progress on the trial and the toxicities experienced will be reviewed by [CONTACT_209708] [ADDRESS_353591] the study 
reviewed by [CONTACT_289908] 6 months based on information 
received.  
All Severe Adverse Events (SAEs) are required to be reported to the IRB.  In addition, all SAEs 
will be submitted to the DSMC at time of submission to IRB and/or Sponsor.   Based on SAEs, 
the IRB retains the authority to close the study to further accrual pending more detailed 
reporting and/or modifications to further reduce risk and maximize the safety of participating 
patients.  
DSM C recommendations should be based not only on results for the trial being monitored as 
well as on data available to the DSM C from other studies.  It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_289862] C is kept apprised of non -confidential results from related studies that 
become available.  It is the responsibility of the DSM C to determine the extent to which this 
information is relevant to its decisions related to the specific trial being monitored.  
 
A written copy of the DSM C recommendations will be given to the trial PI [INVESTIGATOR_72616].  If the 
DSM C recommends a study change for patient safety or efficacy reasons the trial PI [INVESTIGATOR_289863].  In the unlikely event that the trial PI [INVESTIGATOR_289864] C, then the Lombardi Cancer Center Associate Director of Clinical 
Research must be informed of the reason for the disagreement.  The trial PI, DSM C Chair, and 
the Lombardi Cancer Center ADCR will be responsible for reaching a mutually acceptable 
decision about the study.  Confidentiality must be preserved during these discussions.  However, 
in some cases, relevant data may be shared with other selected trial investigators and staff to seek advice to assist in reaching a mutually acceptable decision.  
If a recommendation is made to change a trial for reasons other than patient safety or efficacy the DSMC will provide an adequate rationale for its decision.  
An external cardiologist expert will be added to the DSMC particularly for this study given its 
nature.

·        Neck vein distention 
·        Rales  
·        Radiographic cardiomegaly (increasing heart size on chest radiography)  
·        Acute pulmonary edema  
·        S3 gallop  
·        Increased central venous pressure (>16 cm H2O at right atrium)  
·        Hepatojugular reflux  
·        Weight loss  >4.5 kg in 5 days in response to treatment  
  
Minor criteria: 
·        Bilateral ankle edema  
·        Nocturnal cough  
·        Dyspnea on ordinary exertion 
·        Hepatomegaly  
·        Pleural effusion  
·        Decrease in vital capacity by [CONTACT_289918]  
·        Tachycardia (heart rate>120 beats/min.)  
 
Minor criteria are acceptable only if they can not be attributed to another medical condition 
(such as pulmonary hypertension, chronic lung disease, cirrhosis, ascites, or the nephrotic syndrome).

Appendix H: Echocardiographic Acquisition Protocol  
 
 
Echocardiography will be used to make assessments of left ventricular (LV) and left atrial dimensions and volumes, LV wall thickness and LV mass, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), as well 
as LV myocardial strain measured by [CONTACT_289920]- tracking echocar diography. All study 
echocardiograms will be performed at clinical echocardiographic laboratories and sent to the 
MHRI Core lab for the study analysis and interpretation.  
 
 
Equipment    
Contemporary echocardiographic equipment (Philips, Andover MA, iE33 or newer) with strain 
assessment capacity will be used in this protocol.  All images will be transferred (digitally or on a 
DVD) to the Core lab and securely stored.  
 
The acquisition Transthoracic Echo (TTE) protocol  listed below  may be further modified to be 
compatible with different echocardiographic machines and operating systems.  
 
 
Transthoracic Echo (TTE) Protocol:

Contrast Use Protocol (for technically difficult Echocardiograms)  
Contrast use for enhancing endocardial borders in patients with technically difficult images will 
be indicated if  endocardial border cannot be visualized in two consecutive segments.   Contrast 
will be used only after  the strain protocol is completed as speckle tracking cannot be reliably 
performed post administration of echocardiographic contrast. Intravenous access will be 
obtained and contrast (Definity, Bristol Myers Squibs or Optison, GE Healthcare) will be 
administered according to manufacturer’s protocol. Two chamber and four -chamber api[INVESTIGATOR_289880] (AP2 and AP4) will be obtained following the administration of the  contrast for the 
calculation of LV volumes and EF.

A. Protocol specific procedures should be completed within 30 days after signing informed consent. Clinical 
assessments used for  meeting screening eligibility can be used if done w/in 30 days prior to signing informed 
consent 
B. Once enrollment has occurred, all visits/assessments should occur +/- [ADDRESS_353633] treatment or unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic cardiac disease, or ECHO has met hold criteria.  
I. Research will arrange for the visit/test and will cover the costs. Research will cover Week [ADDRESS_353634] 2 days prior to the next HER2 targeted therapy  
K. Treatment will be assessed starting with weeks .  In the event of treatment delays, time will be counted according 
to the administration of HER2 targeted therapy  so that cardiac assessments (echocardiogram, cardiology visit 
and blood samples) are done in accordance with this  administration. Echocardiograms sent to the Core lab need to be labeled according to the weeks on HER2 therapy.  
L. The exercise stress test will be performed only if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_289931]: 1 of 1  Investigator’s Signature:  [CONTACT_1782]  x

 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study  Design  
 
This is a non -randomized phase I/II study to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) 
and study  the efficacy  of MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) . . Between  [ADDRESS_1261638] 
3+3 design.  The starting  dose was 3 mg. Each  cohort  was evaluated for  tolerability  after completing 
1 cycle of treatment before proceeding  to escalation (4 mg QD or 5 mg QD) or de -escalation  (2 mg 
QD or 2mg 5 days a week).  Escalation/de -escalation  was not to proceed  beyond  5 mg QD or  below 
2 mg  5 days a week, respectively.  The phase  I design  enrolled patients with  thyroid  cancer as defined 
in section  3.0 below.  The phase  II part of the study  uses the RP2D  determined  during  the phase 
I part of the study: 5mg.  
The original phase II cohort was designed to enroll only patients with anaplast ic thyroid cancer 
(ATC) as defined in section 3.0 below. The cohort for patients with ATC continues to enroll 
between 23 -25 patients. . With this amendment, a second phase II cohort of up to 23 -24 patients 
with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), as defin ed in section 3.0 below are to be enrolled.  
Each  respective  cohort  includes  those  patients  from  the phase  I portion  treated  at the MTD.  
 
1.2 Primary  Objectives  
 
• Phase  I: To determine  the recommended phase  II dose (RP2D)  
• Phase  II: To evaluate  the proportion  progression  free at 4 months  in patients  with anaplastic 
thyroid cancer.  
 
1.3 Secondary  Objectives  
 
• To evaluate  safety/adverse  events  
• To evaluate  proportion  progression -free at 6 months  in patients  with DTC.  
• To evaluate response rate  (ORR)  
• To evaluate  overall  survival  (OS)  
• Identification  of biomarkers  predictive  of response  to therapy  with MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) 
 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1261639] malignancies and is characterized by [CONTACT_899924], and early lymphogenous and 
hematogenous metastasis. Even though it accounts for only 2% of all thyroid carcinomas, it is 
responsible  for 14-39% of all cancer  deaths.  Median  survival  is estimated  at 4-9 months  and fewer 
than 20% of patients live beyond one year (1).  
 
No established  treatment  options  exist  for patients  with metastatic  disease.  Rare  responses  to anti- 
VEGF TKI’s are reported but this class of drugs is generally not considered effective (2).  
Protocol  #: 14 -223 
Version  Date:  Protocol  Amendment  20/May  02, [ADDRESS_1261640] on progression free survival (PFS) in pi[INVESTIGATOR_655131]; however, a 
difference in overall survival was not observed between treatment and placebo cohorts (Br ose, 
Schlumberger et al. 2015, Schlumberger, Tahara et al. 2015).  
 
No standard options exist for patients who fail TKI treatment or who do not tolerate or are not 
candidates for treatment due to significant toxicities of these drugs. mTOR inhibitors such a s 
everolimus  have  significant  activity  in these  patients  as we and others  have  demonstrated  in phase 
2 trials (Lim, Chang et al. 2013, Schneider, de Wit et al. 2017, Hanna, Busaidy et al. 2018).  
 
2.2 IND Agent  
 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) is a novel, highly selective, orally bioavailable 
adenosine 5’ triphosphate (ATP) -competitive inhibitor of  the serine/threonine kinase referred to 
as the mechanistic  target  of rapamycin  (mTOR).  MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) 
(formerly INK128) targets [ADDRESS_1261641] multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2.  
 
MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) selectively  and potently  inhibits  mTOR  kinase 
(IC50  = 1.1 nM),  inhibits  mTORC1/2  signaling,  and prevents  cellular  proliferation.  The mTOR  is 
a kinase that regulates cell growth, translational control, angiogenesis, and cell survival by 
[CONTACT_899925].  mTOR  kinase  plays  a key role in several  pathways  that 
are frequently dysregulated in human cancer (3). mTORC1 is best known as a key regulator of 
protein  translation  through  phosphorylation  of 4EBP1  (the eukaryotic  translation  Initiation  Factor 
4E-binding Protein 1) and ribosomal protein S6 (known as S6) kinase. mTORC2 is best known 
for its ability  to fully  activate  protein  kinase  B (AKT)  by [CONTACT_899926] S473  site, which 
regulates proliferation and survival pathways (4).  
 
The mTO R complex (mTORC) is an important therapeutic target that is generally stable (ie, low 
tendency to mutate) and is a key intracellular point of convergence for a number of cellular 
signaling  pathways.  Inhibiting  mTOR  may inhibit  abnormal  cell proliferation,  tumor  angiogenesis, 
and abnormal cellular metabolism, thus providing the rationale for mTOR inhibitors as potential 
agents in the treatment of a number of indications including solid tumor and hematological 
malignancies, as either monotherap y or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Like 
rapamycin, several newly approved rapalogs (temsirolimus and everolimus) are specific and 
allosteric  inhibitors  of mTORC1,  and only partially  inhibit  mTORC1  signaling  pathways.  They  do 
not direct ly inhibit mTORC2, which has shown to be an emerging target in cancer research. 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) was developed to address the incomplete 
inhibition of the mTOR pathway by [CONTACT_380683].  
 
MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) is being  develo ped for both oncology  and non- 
oncology indications. In oncology, MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) is being 
investigated as a treatment for advanced solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, either as 
monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, other molecularly targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or 
antihormonal   agents.   Non-oncology   indications   being   investigated   include   fibrotic   and

 inflammatory diseases in the lung or bronchioles such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).  
 
2.3 Nonclinical  Summary  
 
2.3.1 Pharmacology  
 
MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) selectively  and potently  inhibits  mTOR  kinase 
(the concentration inhibiting 50% of enzyme activity [IC50] is 1.1 nM), inhibits mTORC1/2 
signaling, and prevents cellular proliferation.  
 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) inhibited phosphorylation of downstream 
modulators of mTORC1and mTORC2 i n human U87 glioblastoma tumor xenograft models in 
mice and showed strong tumor growth inhibition (TGI) at tolerable oral (PO) doses in all 8 
xenograft models tested.  
 
2.3.2 Safety  Pharmacology  
 
MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) has a low potential  to affect  the human  ether -à- 
go-go related gene (hERG) potassium ion channel and did not affect cardiovascular (CV) 
parameters in vivo in telemeterized monkeys.  
 
2.3.3 Drug  Metabolism  and Pharmacokinetics  
 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_899895], rats, dogs, and monkeys, with high oral bioavailability. [14C]MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_899896] -Evans  rats; radioactivity  was eliminated  from  most  tissues  at 48 hours  postdose.  MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) displayed  dose-proportional  plasma  exposures,  a moderate 
propensity to cross the blood -brain barrier, and was modestly bound (70.5%) to human plasma 
proteins. MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) distributed mainly to the plasma of 
human  blood.  There  was no obvious  concentration -dependent  red blood  cell (RBC)  distribution  of 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) in human blood.  
 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) did not inhibit P -glycoprotein, but did inhibit 
breast cancer -resistance protein (BCRP), organic cation transporter (OCT)1 and (OCT)2.  
 
M1, the single metabolite (monohydroxylation product) observed in human microsomal 
incubations, was also observed in rat s and monkeys. The main isozymes responsible for phase 1 
metabolism appear to be cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4. MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) did not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 activity and 
expression at concentrations up to 10 µM. MLN0 128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) 
displayed  low potential  for inhibition  and is not a time-dependent  inhibitor  of CYP1A2,  2B6,  2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5.  
 
Oral administration of MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) in humans has a low 
potential  for metabolic  and transporter -based  drug-drug interactions  (DDIs),  especially  given  
Protocol  #: 14 -223 
Version  Date:  Protocol  Amendment  20/May  02, [ADDRESS_1261642]  anticipated  therapeutic  dose 
to be used in the clinic in oncology indications (total m aximum plasma concentration [Cmax] of 
0.48 µM [free Cmax of 0.14 µM] at 30 mg once weekly [QW]).  
 
2.3.4 Toxicology  
 
The toxicologic  profiles  obtained  in the Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP) -compliant  and non-GLP - 
compliant  studies  in rats and monkeys  were  generall y consistent  with pharmacologic  inhibition  of 
mTORC1/2 activity. There were no apparent sex differences in observed toxicities.  
 
The dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) of MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) in rats 
and monkeys were secondary to an exaggerated pharmacologic response and consisted of body 
weight loss and associated clinical observations that included gastrointestinal ( GI) distress and 
decreased activity, appetite, and body temperature. Adverse effects in rats included body weight 
loss, decreased  activity,  increased  glucose  and insulin  levels,  alterations  in white  blood  cells,  bone 
marrow and lymphoid depletion, thymic n ecrosis, oligospermia, testes degeneration/atrophy, 
nonglandular stomach epi[INVESTIGATOR_59460]/ulceration/hyperplasia, and alveolar histiocytosis. 
The microscopic findings observed in the testes and epi[INVESTIGATOR_899897] a 14 - 
day recovery  period, while partial to complete resolution was seen in the lungs, thymus, 
nonglandular stomach, and bone marrow. The adverse effects in monkeys included decreased 
activity, appetite, and body weight; increased glucose and insulin; lymphoid and bone marr ow 
depletion; adrenal hypertrophy/hyperplasia; pancreatic and salivary gland acinar cell secretory 
depletion;  GI tract erosion  and ulceration;  and skin ulceration/epi[INVESTIGATOR_899898].  The findings 
in the pancreas, adrenal glands, and salivary glands may have been related to a stress response or 
reduced  food consumption.  The findings  were  generally  reversible  after a 14-day recovery  period.  
 
The findings in rat and monkey repeat -dose toxicology studies with MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) , including  bone marrow and lymphoid depletion, GI and 
skin effects, and effects on glucose and insulin levels, can be monitored in clinical trials. The 
toxicities seen in the repeat -dose toxicology studies, such as GI effects and glucose and insulin 
increases,  are consistent  with the treatment -emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs),  including  mucositis 
and hyperglycemia, observed to date in patients receiving MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB - 
228/TAK -228) .  
 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) was negative for genotoxicity in an in vitro 
bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay, an in vivo rat micronucleus  assay, and an in vivo rat comet 
assay. An in vitro chromosomal aberration assay with MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB - 
228/TAK -228) in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) was positive for chromosomal 
aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic acti vation.  
 
However,  the weight  of evidence  from  the combined  results  of a negative  mutagenicity  assay  and 
negative genotoxicity assessments in 2 in vivo assays in 3 tissues (bone marrow, liver, and 
duodenum)  demonstrate  that MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) does not present  a 
genotoxic risk.  
 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) was negative for phototoxicity in the 3T3 
fibroblast assay.

Preliminary  findings  in ongoing  rat and rabbit  embryofetal  studies  indicated  teratogenic,  fetotoxic, 
and abortive  effects  with MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) . Embryofetal  lethality 
and/or teratogenic effects have been reported with the TORC1 inhibitors rapamycin and the 
rapalogs.  
 
2.3.5 Summary  of Effects  in Humans  in Advanced  Solid  Malignanc ies and Hematologic 
Malignancies  
 
MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) is in clinical  development  as a single  agent  in 2 
phase 1 studies in patients with advanced solid malignancies and hematologic malignancies 
(multiple myeloma [MM] and  
Waldenström macro globulinemia [WM]); 1 of these studies has been completed. It is also being 
investigated in combination with paclitaxel (with or without trastuzumab) in a phase 1b study in 
patients with advanced solid tumors.  
 
As of the clinical  data cutoff  (09 December  2013),  a total of 248 patients  had received  ≥ [ADDRESS_1261643] been manageable with supportive care and/or dose 
interruption or reduction. A total of [ADDRESS_1261644] study drug dose; of these events, 1 (cardiac arrest; Study 
INK0128 -001) was considered related to MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] of the IB).  
 
2.3.6 Safety  and Efficacy  in Oncology  Studies  
 
In the clinical development plan, the safety and tolerability profile of single -agent MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) is being studied in an ongoing phase 1, first -in-human , 
dose-finding study in patients with advanced solid malignancies (Study INK128 -001) and in a 
completed phase 1 study (Study INK128 -002) in patients with MM and WM. A third study 
(INK128 -003) is being conducted in patients with solid tumors to evaluate the  preliminary safety 
and efficacy of the combination of MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) with 
paclitaxel, with or without trastuzumab.  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1261645] -in-human, dose -escalation study of single -agent MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) administered to patients diagnosed with advanced solid 
malignancies, including, but not limited to, colorectal, renal, endometrial, a nd urothelial tumors. 
Four dosing schedules are being evaluated (QD, QW, QD × 3d QW, and QD × 5d QW). Each 
schedule is administered in [ADDRESS_1261646] 1 dose of MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) . The median age at baseline 
was 60 years (range 24 -89 years). Most (93%) patients are white, and 57% are female.  
Protocol  #: 14 -223 
Version  Date:  Protocol  Amendment  20/May  02, 2022  
10  
 The maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) for the 4 schedules investigated in INK128 -001 were 
determined to be 6 mg for QD dosing, 16 mg for QD × 3d QW dosing, 10 mg for QD × 5d QW 
dosing, and [ADDRESS_1261647] was the only case considered related to study drug.  
 
As of the clinical  database  cutoff  date,  treatment -emergent  SAEs  had been  reported  for 58 patients 
(41%) in this study. The most commonly reported preferred terms overall were mucosal 
inflammation  in 5 patients  (4%),  asthenia  and pneumonia in 4 patients (3%)  each, and  abdominal 
pain, stomatitis, and renal failure in 3 patients (2 %) each.  
 
Overall, ≥ 1 TEAE was reported for 139 (98%) of the [ADDRESS_1261648]  frequently  (65%  of patients).  The second  most  frequent 
TEAE was nausea (63% of patients), followed by [CONTACT_492] (54 %). 
 
In general, TEAEs have been mostly Grade 1 or 2 and manageable with supportive care, and/or 
interruption or dose reduction of study drug. Across all dosing groups, at least 1 TEAE severity 
Grade  3 or higher  had been  reported  for 64% of treated  patients  as of the clinical  data cutoff  date. 
Severity ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs that were reported in 6% or more of patients as of the data cutoff, 
regardless of causality, were hyperglycemia (13% of patients), asthenia (8%), anemia (7%), and 
hypophosphatemia and l ymphopenia (6% of patients each).  
 
Of the 142 patients treated in Study INK128 -001 as of the clinical data cutoff, 74 (52%) 
discontinued because of disease progression, 29 (20%) discontinued because of 1 or more  
AEs,  15 (11%)  withdrew  consent,  and 8 (6%)  were lost to follow -up, used a prohibited  medication, 
or discontinued for other reasons.  
 
A total of 40 AEs led to study discontinuation among 29 patients. A total of 21 events (53%, 
including  11 nonserious  AEs)  were  reported  as severity  Grade  3, and 4 SAEs  were  Grade  5 (fatal). 
No Grade  4 events  were  reported.  The majority  (63%)  of events  had resolved  as of the data cutoff 
date. 
 
A total of 9 preferred terms were reported as leading to discontinuation for more than 1 patient, 
including rash, which was reported in 6 patients (including 2 AEs of maculopapular and 1 
erythematous rash AE), mucosal inflammation (4 patients), and astheni a (3 patients). Events 
reported  in 2 patients  included  hyperglycemia,  nausea,  performance  status  decreased,  pruritus,  and 
renal failure/renal failure acute.  
 
As of [ADDRESS_1261649]  included  hyperglycemia,  asthenia,  fatigue, 
mucositis, and rash. SAEs attributed to MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) have 
included  hyperglycemia,  asthenia,  mucosal  inflammation,  stomatitis,  esophagitis,  nausea,  anemia, 
renal failure, cardiac arrest, and ventricular fibrillation.

 2.3.8 Study  INK128 -002 
 
Study INK -002 is a completed phase 1, open -label, dose -escalation study of oral MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) administered  as a single  agent  in patients  with relapsed  or 
refractory  hematologic  malignancies  (MM  or non-Hodgkin  lymph oma,  including  WM).  A total of 
39 patients received MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) in 1 of 2 regimens: 26 
patients  received  QD doses  (range,  2-7 mg) and 13 patients  were  dosed  on a QD × 3d QW schedule 
(range, 9 -12 mg). The MTD for the QD schedule was 4 mg. The MTD for the QD × 3d QW 
schedule was 9 mg.  
 
A total of 21 of the patients (54%) in this study were male and 87% were white. The median age 
at baseline was 61 years (range, 46 -85 years).  
 
Two patients died during Study INK128 -002. One death was due to a subdural hemorrhage, and 
the other was due to disease progression. Both events were considered by [CONTACT_488444]0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) .  
 
 
Treatment -emergent SAEs were reported in Study INK128 -002 for 11 patients (28%). No SAE 
occurred  in more  than [ADDRESS_1261650]  SAEs  were  considered  severity  Grade  2 or 3. Grade 
4 SAEs were reported in 2 patients: hyperviscosity syndrome and hyponatremia were reported in 
1 patient in the 2 -mg QD dose group (both events resolved); and acute renal failure was reported 
in 1 patient in the 12 -mg QD × 3d QW dose group (resolved with sequelae).  
 
No SAEs wer e considered to be related to MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228)

2.3.9 Study  INK128 -003 
 
Study INK128 -003 is a phase 1, open -label, dose -escalation study of oral MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) administered in 4 -week cycles in combination with 
paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid malignancies (lung, ovarian, endometrial, breast, 
pancreatic, prostate, etc).  
 
As of the clinical  data cutoff  date,  69 patients  had been  enrolled.  Of these  patients,  67 had received  
≥ 1 MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) dose under 1 of 3 dosing schedules: QW; 
QD × 3d QW;  and QD × 5d QW.  With  each regime n, paclitaxel  80 mg/m2  is dosed  on Days  1, 8, 
and [ADDRESS_1261653] positive  for the human  epi[INVESTIGATOR_61983]  2 
protein (HER2+) receive the combination and also receive trastuzumab (8 mg QW).  
 
A total of 57% of the treated patients are female, and 93% are white. At baseline, the median age 
was 60 years (range 21 -81 years).  
 
On the basis  of dose escalation  data,  8 mg of MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) on 
the QD × 3d QW schedule was selected  for the dose expansion phase in breast cancer patients. 
The QD × 5d QW and QW schedules were abandoned before MTDs were declared, as they were 
viewed as less convenient relative to the QD × 3d QW schedule from the perspective of 
administering  the paclitax el and trastuzumab  combination.  The dose expansion  phase  of this study 
remains ongoing.  
 
As of the clinical data cutoff date, [ADDRESS_1261654] 
dose of study drug. Of these patients, 6 died due to disease progr ession, 1 died due to enlarging 
tumor mass causing tracheal compression, 1 died due to pneumonia, and 2 died due to failure to 
thrive.  None  of the events  were  considered  related  to MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK - 
228) .  
 
As of the clinical data cutoff date, 55 SAEs had been reported among 29 patients (43%) in this 
study.  
 
The most commonly reported SAEs included pneumonia in 6 patients (9%), dehydration in 4 
patients (6%), and small intestinal obstruction in 3 patients (4% ). 
 
All patients treated in Study INK128 -[ADDRESS_1261655] 1 TEAE. Regardless of causality, 
TEAEs in 53 patients (79%) were assessed as severity ≥ Grade 3. The most frequently reported 
events include fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea, which were reported i n 67%, 60%, and 52% of 
patients, respectively.  
 
Regardless  of causality,  TEAEs  in 53 patients  (79%)  were  assessed  as severity  ≥ Grade  3. 
The most commonly reported ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs included neutropenia (21% of patients), 
hypophosphatemia (15%), diarrhea and  hyperglycemia (12% of patients each), and fatigue, 
hypokalemia, and vomiting (10% of patients each).

 Of the 63 patients (94%) in Study INK128 -003 who had discontinued MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) treatment as of the clinical data cu toff, 34 (51%) 
discontinued  because  of disease  progression,  15 (22%)  because  of patient  decision,  and 14 (22%) 
because of 1 or more TEAEs.  
 
A total of 21 TEAEs were reported as leading to study discontinuation. Events reported for more 
than 1 patient inclu ded fatigue (4 patients) and pneumonia, rash (including erythematous rash), 
failure to thrive, or vomiting (2 patients, each). A majority (52%) of the events were considered 
not related to MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) .  
 
As of 09 December  2013,  the MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) dosing  regimens 
(and dose ranges)  studied  in INK128 -003 are QDx3d  QW (6-10 mg), QDx5d  QW (7 mg), and QW 
(30 and 40 mg). MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) is administered  in combination 
with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle. The dose 
escalation phase of this study has completed and the administration of MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) plus paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab  is being 
evaluated in the expansion phase. Observed DLTs include fatigue, mucosal inflammation, rash, 
nausea, diarrhea, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. SAEs observed with the 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) + paclitaxel are dehydratio n, diarrhea, 
vomiting, and mucositis.  
 
Due to changes in the manufacturing process which may result in increased absorption of 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) from capsules, there will be a run -in phase I 
prior  to the phase  II of the study.  Patients  with poorly  differentiated  thyroid  cancer, RAI refractory 
differentiated thyroid cancer with prior treatment with a TKI will be allowed to participate in the 
run-in phase  I part in addition  to the incurable  anaplastic  thyroid  cancer  cases.  The phase  II part of 
the study will enroll incurable anaplastic thyroid cancer cases only.  
 
2.3.10  Pharmacokinetics  
 
Overall, pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Studies INK128 -001, INK128 -002, and INK128 -003 
indicate that MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) exhibits fast oral absorp tion (first 
time to maximum  plasma  concentration  [Tmax],  generally  between  1-4 hours  after dosing);  dose- 
linear PK, with a mean plasma half -life (t½) of approximately 8 hours; and that MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) does not accumulate meaningfully  in plasma when dosed 
as frequently as once daily and under any of 4 tested dosing regimens. The PK of MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) was generally consistent, with no appreciable differences 
across the [ADDRESS_1261656] 0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK - 
228) appeared to alter the PK of the other agent when co -administered. Given the changes in 
maufacturing  and different  drug availability,  PK samples  will be collected  in phase  I on C1D8;  at 
0 (before MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) dose) and 2, 4 and 8 hours after the 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) dose. See PK sample processing details in 
Appendix D.  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1261657]  recently  completed  accrual  for an investigator  initiated  phase  II study  in patients  with

Version  Date:  Protocol  Amendment  20/May  02, 2022  
15  
 differentiated thyroid cancer with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, a rapamycin analogue. This 
study also included an exploratory cohort of 7 patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (Hanna, 
Busaidy  et al. 2018).  Among  these  7 cases,  one patient  had a near complete  response  which  lasted 
for 18 months, another patient has ongoing disease stability for 16 months with approximately 
20% shrinkage of the tumor burden and a third patient had a mixed response. Analysis o f the 
patient with the near complete response revealed a nonsense mutation in the tumor suppressor 
TSC2 which acts through suppression of the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). When the patient 
progressed after 18 months, we obtained another biopsy which shows a new  mutation within the 
rapamycin binding site of mTOR (F2108L). Cell culture experiments with transfection of wild 
type versus mutated mTOR show that cells were resistant to rapamycin but sensitive to Torin 2, 
an allosteric mTOR inhibitor similar to ML0128 ( Wagle, Grabiner et al. 2014).  
 
We were also able to show that Torin2, but not rapamycin was able to inhibit phosphorylation of 
S6K, a downstream effector of mTOR, providing further evidence that acquired resistance to 
rapamycin  does not extend  to other  mTOR  inhibitors  and suggesting  that ML0128  could  be useful 
in cases that have acquired resistance to rapamycin analogues such as everolimus. We also 
performed exome sequencing on tumor material from the patient with a mixed response which 
revealed an  activating mutation of PI3K. Primary cell cultures from the same patient showed that 
while everolimus showed some anti -tumor effects initially, these effects diminished over several 
days while Torin2 induced cell death effectively and permanently at low d oses. Another patient 
with metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer who is currently undergoing treatment with off label 
everolimus  recently  had restaging  scans  at 3 months  of therapy  showing  10% reduction  in the size 
of the lesions. Sequencing demonstrated 2 separate missense mutations within the PI3K gene.  
 
In a retrospective  series  of 27 anaplastic  TC cases,  we found  that TSC2  missense  mutations  occur 
in 15%,  loss of TSC2  occur  in 19%.  Missense  mutations  of PI3K  were  demonstrated  in 22%.  Since 
approximately  50% of all cases  had abnormalities  of either  TSC2  or PI3K  and based  on the strong 
response  signal  to everolimus  that we have  observed  in treatment  of anaplastic  thyroid  cancer  cases 
on our everolimus  study  and off protocol,  we anticipate  that between  30 and 50% of cases  should 
respond to treatment with MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) .  
 
The same  phase  II study  also included  differentiated  RAI refractory  thyroid  cancer  and medullary 
thyroid cancer that had progressed within  [ADDRESS_1261658]  TKI’s  such as sorafenib  or 
lenvatinib and for whom no standard options exist plan to be enrolled.

of EDTA blood will also be obtained. Whole exome sequencing will be performed on tumor and 
normal genomic DNA on all patients. Patients with accessible tumors will undergo sequential 
biopsies  prior  to and at [ADDRESS_1261660] 
activation in response to mTOR inhibition to elucidate possible escape mechanisms that could 
account  for resistance  and provide  a rationale  for combination  therapy  in the future.  Patients  with 
mutations and deletions of TSC2 will be evaluated separately and descriptive statistics including 
confidence intervals will be used to evaluate prgoression free survival (PFS); because the s ample 
size of this sub -population is anticipated to be small, no further statistical analysis is planned.

anticipated  treatment  start date.  Issues  that would  cause  treatment  delays  should  be discussed  with 
the Overall PI. If a participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the 
participant’s  registration  on the study  must  be canceled.  The Study  Coordinator  should  be notified 
of cancellations as soon as possible.  
 
4.4 Registration  Proce ss for Other  Investigative  Sites  
 
To register a participant, the following documents should be completed by [CONTACT_403455] (  ) or e -mailed to the Study Coordinator:  
 
• Copy  of relevant  lab tests,  scan reports,  and pathology  reports as described  per the 
eligibility checklist  
• Signed  participant  consent  form  
Protocol  #: 14 -223 
Version  Date:  Protocol  Amendment  20/May  02, 2022  
20  
 • HIPAA  authorization  form  
• Completed  and signed  Eligibility  Checklist  
 
The research nurse or data manager at the participating site will then call or e -mail the Study 
Coordinator  to verify  eligibility.  To complete  the registration  process,  the Coordinator  will follow 
DF/HCC  Standard  Operating  Procedure  for Human  Subject  Resea rch Titled  Decentralized  Subject 
Protocol Registration (SOP #: REGIST -101B) and register the participant on the protocol. The 
coordinator will fax or e -mail the participant study number, and if applicable the dose treatment 
level,  to the participating  site. The coordinator  will also call the research  nurse  or data manager  at 
the participating site to verbally confirm registration.  
 
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Treatment Regimen  
 
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB - 
228/TAK -228) will be administered orally, daily for 28 consecutive days of a treatment cycle. 
The participant will be requested to maintain a medication diary of medication.  The medication 
diary will be returned to clinic staff at the end of each cycle. Treatment with MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) will continue until progression or withdrawal of consent.  
 
Reported adverse events and potential risks of MLN0128 (SAPANISER TIB/CB -228/TAK -228) 
are described in Section 6.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6.  No 
investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_163854]'s malignancy.  
 
5.2 Pre-Treatment  Criteria  
 
As long as the screening lab results meet eligibility criteria, some lab value variance may be 
allowed  by [CONTACT_51199]  1 Day 1, as long as toxicity  criteria  are not met. In the event  that the participant’s 
condition is deteriorating, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within 48 hours prior to 
initiation of the next cycle of therapy.  
 
5.3 Agent  Administration  
 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) capsule will be taken orally, once daily, 
approximately  at the same  time each day, on an empty  stomach.  The patients  should  be instructed 
to refrain from eating and drinking (except for water and any other prescribed medications), for 
two hours before and one hour after each dose. It is recommended t hat each dose of MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) be given with 8 ounces (240 mL) of water.  
 
In the phase  I part of this study,  the starting dose of  3 mg was chosen to  account for  the possibility 
of increased  absorption  with MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) capsules based 
on preliminary MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) milled API [INVESTIGATOR_899903]. Each  cohort should be evaluated for tolerability  after completing  1 cycle of treatment 
before  proceeding  to escalation  (4 mg QD or 5 mg QD) or de-escalation  (2 mg QD).  
Protocol  #: 14 -223 
Version  Date:  Protocol  Amendment  20/May  02, 2022  
21  
 Escalation/de -escalation  should not proceed  beyond  5 mg QD or below  2 mg QD  respectively 
(Table 1).  
 
The phase  II part of the study  will use the phase  II dose  determined  during  the phase  I part of 
the study.  
 
Dose  Escalation  Criteria  for Phase  I 
 
Number  of Subjects  per Cohort 
with DLT During Treatment 
Period  Dose  Escalation  Decision  
0 out of 3 Enter  3 subjects  at the  next dose level.  
1 out of 3 Enter  3 more  subjects  at this dose level.  
 
If no additional  DLT,  proceed  to the next 
dose level.  
 
If an additional  DLT  occurs  (i.e. ≥ 2 DLTs/6 
subjects), dose escalation is stopped and the 
previous dose level is declared the MTD.  
≥ 2 The previous  dose level  is declared  MTD. 
There is no advancement to higher dose 
levels.  
 If during testing of dose level 1 (3mg QD), 
the above rules call for dose de -escalation to 
dose level -1 (2mg QD), then 3 patients will 
be entered  at 2mg QD. If there  are no DLT’s, 
then 2mg will be declared the MTD (since  
no further dose de -escalation is a llowed) and 
entry into expansion cohort will begin (this  
is the same logic if testing escalates up to 
dose level 3 (5mg QD) and there are no 
DLTs observed in the first 3 patients). If 
DLT is observed in the first 3 patients at  
2mg QD, then the above rules will be 
followed for further testing in the 2mg QD 
cohort prior to decisions about any patients 
being entered into an expansion cohort or 
not.

228/TAK  228) Dose  
 
 
 
 
If severe emesis or mucositis prevents the patient from taking an MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) dose,  that dose will be skipped.  If emesis  occurs  after study 
medication ingestion and whole capsule is visible in the vomitus, replacement capsule should be 
taken; otherwise the dose will not be re -administered, and patients should simply adhere to the 
dosing schedule and resume dosing at the next scheduled ti me with the prescribed dosage. Under 
no circumstance should a patient repeat a dose or double -up doses.  
 
5.3.1 Dose -Limiting  Toxicity:  
 
Toxicity  will be assessed  using  the NCI Common  Toxicity  Criteria  for Adverse  Events,  version  
4.0 http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf  
unless otherwise specified (e.g., hyperglycemia). A dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as  
an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease 
progression,  inter-current  illness,  or concomitant  medications,  and occurs  < [ADDRESS_1261672] dose of MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) , and meets  any of the criteria  listed 
below.  
 
Whenever a patient experiences toxicity that fulfills the criteria for a DLT (or a potential DLT), 
treatment with MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) will be interrupted (if not 
otherwise  specified)  and the toxicity  will be followed  up as described  in section  5.3.3.  The criteria 
for dose -limiting toxicities are outlined below.  
 
5.3.2 Criteria  for Defining  Dose -Limiting  Toxicities

b For any grade  3 or 4 hepatic  toxicity  that does not resolve  within  7 days to grade  1 (or grade  2 if liver infiltration with 
tumor present), an abdominal CT scan has to be performed to assess if it is related to disease progression.  
A single  patient  is assumed  not to tolerate  the dose if he/she  experiences at  least one DLT.  If a lower  grade  AE leads  to a dose 
interruption of more than 7 doses of MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) , this AE will be considered as DLT.  
If the 2nd occurrence  of an initially  non-dose limiting  toxicity  (e.g.,  grade  [ADDRESS_1261679] 
occurrence) leads to a dose reduction (Section 6) within [ADDRESS_1261680] dose of MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB - 
228/TAK -228) , this will be considered a DLT.

treatment interrupted. If the event resolves to Grade 1 or baseline values within 2 weeks of 
interrupting planned therapy, and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_899905], patients may continue study treatment with 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) at a 20% to 33% dose reduction (ie, dose 
reduced from 5 mg to  4 mg [20%];  from 4 mg to 3  mg [25%];  from 3 mg  to 2 mg [33%]; or  if 
dose modification is required for patients receiving 2 mg QD, then the  dosing frequency should 
be decreased to 5 days per week (28% reduction) instead of decreasing the daily dose 
administered. If study drug dosing is delayed for more  than 14 consecuti ve days  for MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) -related toxicity,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_899906], the patient should be discontinued from the study treatment and complete the 
follow -up visit within [ADDRESS_1261682] admini stration of MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB - 
228/TAK -228) and continue to be followed according to protocol until first disease progression 
or death whichever occurs fist. Patients may, however, hold drug over 14 consecutive days if PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_899907].  
 
5.4 General  Concomitant  Medication  and Supportive  Care  Guidelines  
 
Because there is a potential for interaction of MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) 
with other  concomitantly  administered  drugs  through  the cytochrome  P450  system,  the case report 
form  must  capture  the concurrent  use of all other  drugs,  over-the-counter  medications,  or 
Protocol  #: 14 -223 
Version  Date:  Protocol  Amendment  20/May  02, [ADDRESS_1261683] selected CYP450 isoenzymes, including CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and 
CYP2C9. Appendix C presents guidelines for identifying medications/substances that could 
potentially interact with the study agent.  
 
5.5 Criteria  for Taking  a Participant  Off Protocol  Therapy  
 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and 
tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for 
until one of the following criteria  applies:  
 
• Disease  progression  
• Intercurrent  illness that  prevents  further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable  adverse  event(s)  
• Participant  demonstrates  an inability  or unwillingness  to comply  with the oral 
medication regimen and/or documentation requirements  
• Participant  decides  to withdraw  from  the protocol  therapy  
• General  or specific  changes  in the participant's  condition  render  the participant  
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating investigator  
 
Participants will be removed from the protocol therapy when any of these criteria apply.  The 
reason for removal from protocol therapy, and the date the participant was removed, must be 
documented in the case report form (CRF). Altern ative care options will be discussed with the 
participant.  
 
A QACT  Treatment  Ended  will be filled  out when  a participant  is removed  from  protocol  therapy. 
This form can be found on the QACT website or obtained from the QACT registration staff. 
Patients who discontinue protocol treatment for reasons other than disease progression will 
continue to be followed according to protocol until first disease progression or death whichever 
occurs  first, or if first disease  progression  has been  documented,  will be followed  until death  or [ADDRESS_1261684] progression,  participants 
will be followed for survival by [CONTACT_482545], every 3 months (+/ - 2 weeks) for [ADDRESS_1261685]. Participants removed from protocol therapy for 
unacceptable  adverse  event(s)  will be followed  until resolution  or stabilization  of the adverse  event 
and continue to be followed according to protocol until first disease progression or death 
whichever occurs fist.  
 
5.7 Criteria  for Taking  a Participant  Off Study  
 
Participants  will be removed  from  study  when  any of the following  criteria  apply:  
Protocol  #: 14 -223

 • Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal  of consent  for data  submission  
• Death  
 
The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participant was removed, must be 
documented in the case report form (CRF).  
 
A QACT Off Study Form will be filled out when a participant comes off study. This form can be 
found on the QACT webs ite or obtained from the QACT registration staff.  
 
 
6. DOSING  DELAYS/DOSE  MODIFICATIONS  
 
Dose  delays  and modifications  will be made  as indicated  in the following  tables.  The descriptions 
and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE)  version  4.0 will be utilized  for dose delays  and dose modifications.  A copy  of the 
CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
Patients who experience an AE  that meets the definition of a DLT should have their stud y drug 
treatment interrupted If the event resolves to Grade 1 or baseline values within 2 weeks of 
interrupting planned therapy, and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_899905], patients may continue study treatment with 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) .  
 
For the phase  I part of the study,  treatment  will continue  at a 20% to 33% dose  reduction (ie, dose 
reduced from 5 mg to  4 mg [20%]; from 4 mg to 3  mg [25%];  from 3 mg  to 2 mg [33%] ; or if 
dose modification is required for patients receiving 2 mg QD, then the  dosing frequency should 
be decreased to 5 days per week (28% reduction) instead of decreasing the daily dose 
administered. If study drug dosing is delayed for more  than 14 consecutive days  for MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) -related toxicity,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_899906], the patient should be discontinued from the study treatment and complete the 
follow -up visit within [ADDRESS_1261686] administration of MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB - 
228/TAK -228) and continue  to be followed  according  to protocol  (see section.10.0).  Patients  may, 
however, hold drug over 14 consecutive days if PI [INVESTIGATOR_899907].  
 
Dose will be modified according  to the same criteria in Phase I and II and dose levels will follow 
as specified in table 1a and 1 b below.  
 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) dosing should be withheld for ≥ Grade 2 renal 
insufficiency  or ≥ Grade  3 MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) -related  toxicities.  If 
the event resolves to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_1261687] may resume study treatment at a dose reduction. If a dose modification is required for 
subjects receiving 2 mg QD, then the dos ing frequency should be decreased to 5 days per week, 
instead of decreasing the daily dose administered.  
See table  of dose adjustments  below  according  to the schedule  applied  in this protocol.  If

6.1 Management  of Clinical  Events  
 
6.1.1 Management  of Hyperglycemia  
In addition to obtaining fasting serum glucose (FSG) levels at clinic visits, all subjects will be 
given a glucometer to monitor their daily pre -dose fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels at home. 
Subjects  will be instructed  to notify  the study  staff immediately  with any abnormal  readings  (ie, ≥ 
150 mg/dL) for further instructions on the management of their hyperglycemia.  Hyperglycemia 
observed  during  home  glucose  monitoring  should  be confirmed  in the clinic.  Investigators  will be 
responsible  for reviewing  the home  glucose  monitoring  logs for hyperglycemia.  If no irregularities 
in the fasting blood glucose level are observed during a minimum of 2  consecutive months, then 
the frequency  of in-home  fasting  glucose  testing  may be reduced  to once  weekly  if the investigator 
approves. Subjects will continue to notify the investigator of fasting blood glucose levels that 
exceed 150 mg/dL and, if blood glucose levels are not well -controlled, or if the subject requires 
either oral hypoglyce mic agents or insulin to control blood glucose levels, then the frequency of 
in-home testing of fasting blood glucose levels will be reinstated to daily. Weekly glucose 
monitoring  may stop after [ADDRESS_1261690] fasting glucose collected at each monthly clinic visit.  
Guidance  for MLN0128  (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) dose management  in the event  of 
hyperglycemia is provided in the table below.

• Early  initiation of therapy  is recommended to  prevent higher grade hyperglycemia.  
• Fasting blood glucose levels ≥  150 mg/dL by [CONTACT_298322].  
 
Abbreviations:  dL = deciliters;  mg = milligrams;  ULN  = upper  limit  of normal.  
a If dose modification  is required  for subjects  receiving  2 mg, then the frequency  of dosing  should  be 
decreased to 5 days/week, rather than decreasing the daily dose administered.  
 
In the event  that any FSG reading  performed  at the site indicates  hyperglycemia  (> upper  limit  of 
normal [ULN] or ≥ 110 mg/dL), the study staff should first ascertain that the subject was fasting 
at the time of the blood draw (ie, nothing by [CONTACT_24314] 8 hours prior to blood being 
obtained), had continued to take their concomitant antiglycem ic medications should the subject 
have underlying diabetes mellitus, and repeat the FSG as needed.  If the repeat FSG continues to 
demonstrate hyperglycemia, investigators should initiate steps to aggressively manage the 
hyperglycemia per standard clinical practice.  The following guidelines are provided to aid the 
investigator in initiating antiglycemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Based on the clinical experience from MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) trials, 
most epi[INVESTIGATOR_845057] [ADDRESS_1261691]  their glucose  closely  monito red by [CONTACT_49124].  The investigator  may choose  either  to continue 
close  monitoring  of subjects  who develop  Grade  1 hyperglycemia  (FSG  > ULN  ≤ 160 mg/dL)  or, 
alternatively, consider initiating treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent, such as metformin. 
All subjects  with Grade  ≥ 2 hyperglycemia  (FSG  > 160 mg/dL)  must  be treated  aggressively  with 
oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin as clinically indicat ed while continuing on MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) .  The investigator should consult an endocrinologist if 
needed to aid in optimizing the subject’s hyperglycemia treatment plan.  
 
It is recommended that subjects be treated initially with a fast a cting, insulin sensitizer, such as 
metformin at 500 mg PO QD, and titrate up to a maximum of 1000 mg PO BID as needed. 
Concurrent  addition  to metformin  of DPP-4 inhibitors  (eg, sitagliptin  or vildagliptin)  and/or  insulin 
should also be considered.  Oral sul fonylureas (eg, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_53289]) should be used with 
caution due to the higher risk of inducing hypoglycemia in subjects.  The dose of oral 
hypoglycemic agents should be adjusted in subjects with renal insufficiency.

 7. ADVERSE  EVENTS:  LIST  AND  REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and rep orting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The list of 
reported and/or potential AEs (Section 6) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.1) 
will determine whether the event requires routine reporting.  
 
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation  or delay  in treatment,  dose modification,  therapeutic  intervention,  or is considered 
by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from baseline.  
 
Adverse  event  (AE)  means  any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a patient  or subject  administered 
a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessaril y have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether  or not it is related to the medicinal product. 
This includes  any newly  occurring  event,  or a previous  condition  that has increased  in severity  or 
frequency since the administration of study drug.  
 
7.1 Adverse  Event  Characteristics  
 
• CTCAE term (AE description)  and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales 
found  in the revised  NCI Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE) 
version 4.[ADDRESS_1261694] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 
can be downloaded  from  the CTEP  web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
• For expedited  reporting  purposes  only:  
- AEs for the agent(s)  that are listed  above  should  be reported  only if the adverse  event 
varies in nature, intensity or frequency from the expected toxicity information which 
is provided.  
- Other AEs for the protocol  that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in the 
next section  (Expedited  Adverse  Event  Reporting)  under  the sub-heading  of Protocol - 
Specific Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Exclusions.  
 
• Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite  – The AE is clearly  related  to the study  treatment.  
- Probable  – The AE is likely  related  to the study  treatment.  
- Possible  – The AE may be related  to the study  treatment.  
- Unlikely  – The AE is doubtfully  related  to the study  treatment.  
- Unrelated  – The AE is clearly  NOT  related  to the study  treatment.  
 
7.2 Expedited  Adverse  Event  Reporting  
Protocol  #: 14 -223 
Version  Date:  Protocol  Amendment  20/May  02, [ADDRESS_1261695]  report  to the Overall  PI [INVESTIGATOR_318519]  (SAE)  that occurs  after the 
initial dose of study treatment, during treatment, or within [ADDRESS_1261696] dose of treatment 
on the local institutional SAE form.  
 
7.3 Expedited  Reporting  to the Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  
 
The Overall  PI, as study  sponsor,  will be responsible  for all communications  with the FDA.  The 
Overall  PI [INVESTIGATOR_399723],  regardless  of the site of occurrence,  any serious  adverse  event 
that meets the FDA’s criteria for expedited reporting following the reporting requirements and 
timelines set by [CONTACT_1622].  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1261697] be reported in routine study data submissions to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_806978].  
 
7.5.1 Serious  Adverse  Event  Definition  
Serious  AE (SAE)  means  any  untoward  medical   occurrence   that at any  dose: 
Results  in death.Is  life-threatening  (refers  to an AE in which  the patient  was at risk of death  at the 
time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were  more  severe).Requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202917] 
(see clarification  in the paragraph  below  on planned  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]).Results  in persistent  or 
significant disability or incapacity. (Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s 
ability  to conduct  normal  life functions) . Is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect.Is  a medically 
important  event.  This refers  to an AE that may not result  in death,  be immediately  life threatening, 
or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  but may be considered  serious  when,  based  on appropriate  medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require medical or surgical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_1261698]  of an infectious 
agent.  Examples  of such medical  events  include  allergic  bronchospasm  requiring  intensive  
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism,  
virus, or infectious  particle (eg, prion protein  transmitting  Transmissible  Spongiform 
Encephalopathy),  pathogenic   or nonpathogenic,  is considered  an infectious  agent. 
Clarification  should  be made between a  serious  AE (SAE)  and an AE  that is considered  severe  in 
intensity  (Grade  3 or 4), because  the terms  serious  and severe  are NOT  synonymous.  The general 
term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, 
however, may be of relatively minor medical significance  (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is 
NOT the same as serious, which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described  
above,  and is usually  associated  with events  that pose a threat  to a patient’s  life or ability  to 
function.  A severe  AE (Grade  3 or 4) does not necessarily  need  to be considered  serious.  For 
example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 (severe) 
but may not be considered  serious.  Seriousness  (not intensity)  serves  as a guide  for defin ing 
Protocol  #: 14 -223 
Version  Date:  Protocol  Amendment  20/May  02, 2022  
36  
 regulatory  reporting obligations.  
 
7.5.2 Procedures  for Reporting  Serious  Adverse  Events:  
AEs may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open question from 
study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic 
procedures. Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments o r other clinical 
finding is considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying  pathology  should  be noted  as one comprehensive  event.  AEs which  are serious  must 
be reported  from the time  
of consent up to and including [ADDRESS_1261699] dose of MLN0128 
(SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) . Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) treatment or after the designated follow -up 
period that the sponsor -investigator  and/or  sub-investigator  considers  to be related  to study  drug 
must be reported  Planned  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_899920] (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or later than planned).  
All SAEs  should  be monitored  until they are resolved  or are clearly  determined  to be due to a 
patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).  
 
Since this is an investigator -initiated study, the sponsor -investigator Kartik Sehgal, MD, also 
referred  to as the sponsor -investigator, is responsible  for reporting  serious adverse  events (SAEs) 
to any regulatory agency and to the sponsor - investigator’s IRB. Regardless of expectedness or 
causality,  all SAEs  must  also be reported  
 
• Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs: within 24 hours but no later than 4 calendar 
days of the sponsor -investiga tor’s observation or awareness of the event.  
 
• All other serious (non -fatal/non life threatening) events: within 4 calendar 
days of the sponsor -investigator’s  observation  or awareness  of the event.  See 
below for contact [CONTACT_899931]:  
Event term(s) Serious criteria; Intensity of the event(s): Sponsor -investigator’s or sub - 
investigator’s determination. Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, will be 
determined by [CONTACT_128751], as a guideline, whenever 
possible.  The criteria  are available  online  at http://ctep.c ancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.Causality  of 
the event(s): Sponsor -investigator’s or sub -investigator’s determination of the relationship of the 
event(s) to study drug administration.  
 
Follow -up information  on the SAE  may be requested  Sub-investigators  must  report  
all SAEs to the sponsor -investigator so that the sponsor -investigator can meet his/her foregoing 
reporting obligations to the required regulatory agencies  unless 
otherwise    agreed    between    the   sponsor -investigator    and   sub-investigator(s).  
 
Relationship  to study  drug for each SAE  will be determined  by [CONTACT_107246]-investigator

 by [CONTACT_728571]:  Is there  a reasonable  possibility  that the AE 
is associated with the study drug(s)?  
 
Sponsor -investigator  must   also  provide  a  copy   of  all 
communications  with applicable  regulatory  authorities  related  to the study  drug product  as soon

13. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Original  Design  when  trial Opened:  
 
This trial was originally designed as a phase II trial only with a primary endpoint of proportion 
progression -free at 4 months for patients with metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC).  
 
Phase  I Cohort  (ATC  and DTC):  
Due to changes in the manufacturing process which has resulted in increased absorption of 
MLN0128 (SAPANISERTIB/CB -228/TAK -228) from capsules, a run -in phase I prior to the 
phase II of the study is needed. Due to the poor prognosis and short median survival of patients 
with incurable anaplas tic thyroid cancer, patients with poorly differentiated thyroid cancer, RAI 
refractory differentiated thyroid cancer who failed prior treatment with a TKI, will be allowed to 
participate in the run -in phase I portion in addition to the incurable metastatic  anaplastic thyroid 
cancer  cases so  that a more  comprehensive longer term  adverse event profile  can be documented.  
 
Phase I Design: (As of the writing of this Amendment, the phase I portion is complete and 
the MTD/RP2D is 5mg).  
 
This portion of the trial f ollows a standard 3+3 phase I design. The primary endpoint is to 
determine the MTD. Patients will be started at a given dose and escalated according to the 
information outlined in section 5.3.  
 
The table  below  gives  the probabilities  of the dose escalation  scheme  outlined  in section  5.3. 
 
True  Rate of DLT  Probability  of Escalation  
20% .71 
30% .49 
40% .31 
50% .17 
60% .08 
 
For example,  if the true rate of DLT  is 20% at a given  dose,  there  is a 71% probability  of escalating  
Protocol  #: 14 -223 
Version  Date:  Protocol  Amendment  20/May  02, [ADDRESS_1261718]  6 patients  per level  plus an additional  10 at the MTD  (these  10 
accrued  to ensure  that the adverse  event  rate at the MTD  is acceptable).  The estimation  of adverse 
events will be based on studying these 10 additional patients. The width of the 90% confidence 
interval for the estimation of the adverse event rate will be no more than 56%.  
 
Patients  with metastatic  anaplastic  thyroid  cancer  who are treated  at the MTD  in the phase  I portion 
will be included in the phase II portion.  
 
Phase  II Original  Cohort  of patients  with  ATC  only. 
Statistical Design for patients with ATC:  
 
For the phase II portion of this trial, given the short median survival of this patient p opulation 
(patients  with ATC)  and the expectation  of the mechanism  of this drug to more  frequently  induce 
disease stability (while allowing for at least [ADDRESS_1261719] baseline), the primary 
endpoint of the phase II portion of the study is to evaluate the proportion progression -free at 4 
months.  
 
A Simon  two-stage  design  will be used to minimize  the number  of patients  exposed  to this regimen 
and the specific sample size and operating characteristics were chosen to be able to show that the 
proportion progression -free at 4 months is greater than 11%.  
 
 
In the first stage, accrual will conti nue until 13 evaluable patients (eligible patients who begin 
protocol  therapy)  are entered.  If there  are ≤1 patient  whose  disease  is progression -free at 4 months, 
accrual  to the trial will be closed  with the conclusion  that there  is little evidence  that the proportion 
progression -free at 4 months would reach 33%. The probability that the trial will close early is 
57% if the true proportion progression -free is 11%.  
 
If there  are ≥2 patients  among  13 evaluable  patients  whose  disease  is progression -free at 4 months, 
the trial will continue to accrue patients until a total of 23 evaluable patients are entered. If there 
are ≥5 patients  whose  disease  is progression -free at 4 months  among  23 evaluable  patients,  further 
testing of this regimen will be conside red. The probability of concluding the regimen is effective 
is 90% if the true proportion progression -free is 33%. The probability of concluding the regimen 
is effective  is 10% if the true proportion  progression -free is 11%.  Allowing  2 patients  to not begin 
protocol  treatment  or be classified  as ineligible  or withdraw  and refuse  follow  up prior  to 4 months, 
a total of 25 patients will be entered.  
 
Patients with metastatic ATC who are treated at the MTD in the phase I portion are included in 
this phase I I cohort.  
As of the writing  of this amendment,  this cohort  of patients  with ATC  continues  to accrue. 
Phase II Amendment for Cohort of patients with DTC.  
Rational  for cohort  of patients  with DTC:  
Protocol  #: 14 -223 
Version  Date:  Protocol  Amendment  20/May  02, 2022  
47  
  
Given the activity with agents such as everolimus in RAI refractory thyroid cancer, subjects wth 
metastatic, incurable differentiated RAI refractory and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer were 
enrolled  during  the phase  1 part of this trial (see above).  As of this amendment,  a similar  phase  II 
cohort  of these  patients  who have  previously  failed  or who can not tolerate  FDA  approved  standard 
TKI’s such as sorafenib or lenvatinib and/or are not candidates for these treatments due to 
significant  toxicities  of these  drugs  and for whom  no standard  options  exist,  plan to be enrolled  in 
an exploratory cohort.  
 
Statistical  Design  for patients  with DTC:  
 
To keep  the overall  number  of patients  accrued  to this trial within  the overall  original  clinical  trial 
budget, n=23 patients are proposed to be entered into this cohort of patients with DTC, therefore, 
only large differences would be able to be detected with reasonable operating characteristics. 
Given  that overall  outcome  is slightly  better  for this population  with DTC,  relative  to patients  with 
ATC, the target endpoint is proportion progression -free at 6 months.  
 
Results  from  the DECISION  trial showed  a median  PFS of 10.8 months  for patients  who received 
sorafenib,  corresponding  to a a 6 month  proportion  progression -free of approximately  68% (under 
an exponential distribution). A Simon two -stage design will be used and the specific sample size 
and operating characteristics were chosen to be able to show that the proportion progression -free 
at 6 months is greater than 45%.  
 
In the first stage, accrual will continue until 12 evaluable patients (eligible patients who begin 
protocol therapy) are entered. If there are ≥6 patients among 12 evaluable patients whose disease 
is progression -free at 6 month s, the trial will continue  to accrue  patients  until a total of 23 evaluable 
patients  are entered.  If there  are ≥[ADDRESS_1261720] stage is 53% if the true 6 month rate is 45%. The probability of 
concluding the regimen is effective is 87% if the true p roportion progression -free is 70% and 9% 
if the true proportion progression -free is 45%.  
 
Patients with DTC who were treated at the MTD in the phase I portion (n=7) are included in this 
phase II cohort.  
 
 
Analyses  and Accrual  Estimates:  
The primary efficac y population includes all eligible patients who begin protocol treatment. The 
proportion progression -free rates will be summarized as a proportion with a corresponding exact 
95% binomial confidence interval (if the trial closes to accrual after the first s tage) or a 
corresponding 95% two -stage confidence interval if the trial closes to accrual after the second 
stage. Safety will be assessed via the CTCAE vs 4 and frequencies of adverse events will be 
summarized. The progression -free survival and overall sur vival will be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier method and 95% confidence intervals for the median or time -specific event time 
will be summarized.  
 
With  an estimated  monthly  accrual  of 1 to 2 patients  with DTC  and given  that n=7 patients  with

Purpose: Targeting mutation s leading to PI3K/mTOR/Akt activation are of interest in 
thyroid  cancer.  We evaluated  the efficacy  of everolimus  in aggressive,  radioactive  iodine - 
refractory  (RAIR)  thyroid  cancer  and correlated  tumor  mutational  profiling  with response. 
Exploratory medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer cohorts were included.Experimental 
Design: This single -arm, multi -institutional phase II study was conducted from 2009 to 
2013  in patients  with incurable  RAIR  thyroid  cancer  who had radiographic  progression  six 
months  prior  to enrollment.  The primary  endpoint  was progression -free survival  (PFS)  with 
a median follow -up of 31.8 months. The study is closed to enrollment but treatment and

mutational analysis.Results: Thirty -three patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), 
10 with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and 7 with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) 
enrolled. For the DTC cohort, median PFS was 12.9 months (9 5% CI, 7.3 -18.5) with a 2 - 
year PFS of 23.6%  (95%  CI, 10.5-39.5).  Median  OS was not reached;  2-year OS was 73.5% 
(95%  CI, 53.8-85.8).  Among  ATC  patients,  1 had a partial  response  and was progression - 
free until 17.9 months after study entry and one had disease stability for 26 months, 
respectively. The genomically profiled cohort enriched for PI3K/mTOR/Akt alterations. 
PI3K/mTOR/Akt -mutated ATC subgroups appeared to benefit from everolimus .

BACKGROUND: This phase II study investigated the efficacy and safety of everolimus, 
an inhibitor  of mammalian  target  of rapamycin  (mTOR),  in locally  advanced  or metastatic 
thyro id cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with thyroid cancer of any 
histology that was resistant or not appropriate for (131)I received everolimus 10 mg daily 
orally  until unacceptable  toxicity  or disease  progression.  The primary  end point  was disease 
control rate [partial response (PR) + stable response >/=12 weeks]. Secondary end points 
included response rates, clinical benefit (PD + durable stable disease (SD)], progression - 
free survival (PFS), overall survival, duration of response, and saf ety. RESULTS: Thirty - 
eight  of 40 enrolled  patients  were  evaluable  for efficacy.  The disease  control  rate was 81% 
and two (5%)  patients  achieved  objective  response;  their duration  of response  was 21+ and 
24+ weeks. Stable disease (SD) and progressive disea se was reported in 76% and 17% of 
patients, respectively. Seventeen (45%) patients showed durable SD (>/=24 weeks) and 
clinical benefit was reported in 19 (50%) patients. Median PFS was 47 weeks [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 14.9 -78.5]. Calcitonin, CEA, an d thyroglobulin concentrations 
were >/=50% lower than baseline in three (30%) and four (44%) patients with medullary 
thyroid cancer and five (33%) patients with PTC, respectively. The most common 
treatment -related adverse events were mucositis (84%), anore xia (44%), and aspartate 
transaminase/alanine transaminase elevation (26%). CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus had a 
limited activity with low response rate in locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer. 
Reasonable clinical benefit rate and safety profile may warr ant further investigation.

cancer." N Engl J Med  372(7): 621 -630. 
BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib, an oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptors  1, 2, and 3, fibroblast  growth  factor receptors  1 through  4, platelet -derived  growth 
factor  receptor  alpha,  RET,  and KIT,  showed  clinical  activity  in a phase  2 study  involving 
patients with differentiated thyroid cancer that was refractory to radioiodine (iodine -131). 
METHODS: In our phase 3, randomized, double -blind, multicenter study involving 
patients with progressive thyroid cancer that was refractory to iodine -131, we randomly 
assigned 261 patients to receive lenvatinib (at a daily dose of 24 mg per day in 28 -day 
cycles)  and 131 patients  to receive  placebo.  At the time of disease  progression,  patients  in 
the placebo group could receive open -label lenvatinib. The pr imary end point was 
progression -free survival. Secondary end points included the response rate, overall 
survival,  and safety.  RESULTS:  The median  progression -free survival  was 18.3 months  in 
the lenvatinib group and 3.6 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression or 
death, 0.21; 99% confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.31; P<0.001). A progression -free survival 
benefit  associated  with lenvatinib  was observed  in all prespecified  subgroups.  The response 
rate was 64.8% in the lenvatinib group (4 complete responses and 165 partial responses) 
and 1.5%  in the placebo  group  (P<0.001).  The median  overall  survival  was not reached  in 
either  group.  Treatment -related  adverse  effects  of any grade,  which  occurred  in more than

 40% of patients in the lenvatinib group, were hypertension (in 67.8% of the patients), 
diarrhea (in 59.4%), fatigue or asthenia (in 59.0%), decreased appetite (in 50.2%), 
decreased weight (in 46.4%), and nausea (in 41.0%). Discontinuations of the study drug 
because of adverse effects occurred in 37 patients who received lenvatinib (14.2%) and 3 
patients  who received  placebo  (2.3%).  In the lenvatinib  group,  6 of 20 deaths  that occurred 
during the treatment period were considered to be drug -related. CONCLUSIONS: 
Lenvatinib, as compared with placebo, was associated with significant improvements in 
progression -free survival  and the response  rate among  patients  with iodine -131-refra ctory 
thyroid cancer. Patients who received lenvatinib had more adverse effects. (Funded by

Cancer: R esults of a Phase II Clinical Trial." J Clin Endocrinol Metab  102(2): 698 -707. 
Background: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) upregulation has been reported to 
be involved  in the pathogenesis  of thyroid  tumors,  and treatment  with the mTOR  inhibitor 
evero limus  has shown  promising  results  in endocrine  tumors.  We conducted  a prospective 
phase II clinical trial to determine the efficacy and safety of everolimus in patients with 
advanced follicular -derived thyroid cancer. Patients and Methods: Twenty -eight patients 
with progressive metastatic or locally advanced radioactive refr actory differentiated 
thyroid cancer and 7 patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer were included and received 
everolimus 10 mg orally once daily. The primary endpoint was disease control rate 
[complete (CR) + partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD) > 2 4 weeks]. Secondary 
endpoints included progression -free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and 
mutational and pharmacokinetic -related outcomes. Results: Median follow -up duration 
was 38 months (2 -64). Seventeen patients (65%) showed SD, of wh ich 15 (58%) showed 
SD >24 weeks.  No CR or PR was observed.  Median  PFS and OS were  9 [95%  confidence 
interval (CI): 4 to 14] and 18 (95% CI: 7 to 29) months, respectively. Survival was 
negatively influenced by [CONTACT_899935]. Toxicity was predominantly 
grade  1/2 and included  anemia  (64%),  cough  (64%),  stomatitis  (61%),  and hyperglycemia 
(61%).  Duration  of SD was related  to everolimus  exposure.  The presence  of somatic  gene 
variants related to mTOR signaling did not clearly stratify for respo nses. Conclusion: 
Everolimus has clinically relevant antitumor activity in patients with advanced 
differentiated  thyroid  cancer.  Given  the observed  disease  control  rate and the relatively  low 
toxicity  profile,  further  investigation  of everolimus  in sequential  or combination  therapy  in 
these patients is warranted.  
 
Wagle, N., et al. (2014). "Response and acquired resistance to everolimus in anaplastic thyroid 
cancer." N Engl J Med  371(15): 1426 -1433.  
Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of  rapamycin (mTOR), is effective in 
treating tumors harboring alterations in the mTOR pathway. Mechanisms of resistance to 
everolimus  remain  undefined.  Resistance  developed  in a patient  with metastatic  anaplastic 
thyroid  carcinoma  after an extraordinary  18-month  response.  Whole -exome  sequencing  of 
pretreatment and drug -resistant tumors revealed a nonsense mutation in TSC2, a negative 
regulator of mTOR, suggesting a mechanism for exquisite sensitivity to everolimus. The 
resistant tumor also harbored a mutatio n in MTOR that confers resistance to allosteric 
mTOR inhibition. The mutation remains sensitive to mTOR kinase inhibitors.

There are no known strong specific CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers. Examples of moderate 
inhibitors of CYP2C9 are fluconazole and miconazole; moderate inducers of CYP2C9 are 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_899921].  These  agents  show  some  degree  of overlap  with their modu lation  of 
CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 activity and should hence be considered with similar caution.  
 
Strong inhibitors of CYP2C19 include fluconazole, fluvoxamine, omeprazole, and ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325]. 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 include ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavi r, mibefradil, indinavir,

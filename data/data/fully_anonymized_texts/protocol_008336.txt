Title of Study: A Multicenter,  Randomized,  Double-blind, Active -controlled  Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Efficacy of EXPAREL  Plus Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426615] 
(TAP) Versus Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426616]:  To be determined  
Study Center(s):  Multicenter  study in North America 
Publications (Reference):  None 
Objectives:  
Primary objective: The primary objective of this study is to compare total opi[INVESTIGATOR_338358]  72 hours 
following  EXPAREL+bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426617] (TAP) after spi[INVESTIGATOR_426618] 
(C-section). 
Secondary  objective: The secondary  objectives  are to assess efficacy and  safety parameters  and patient satisfaction.  
Methodology:  
This is a Phase-4, multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind, active -controlled study in  approximately [ADDRESS_539237] all her questions answered by [CONTACT_1275]/study staff  prior to providing  informed consent. Screening procedures  that are standard of care (SOC) at 
the institution may  be completed  prior to written informed consent. Any screening procedures  that are not SOC, must 
be completed  after written informed consent is provided  and prior to  surgery. 
Screening  
Subjects will be screened within 30 days  prior to surgery; screening  on the day of surgery will be allowed but is 
discouraged.  If a subject can only be screened on the day of surgery, the informed consent process must still be  
started at least [ADDRESS_539238] be performed  and documented within the 30 -day time window (inclusive of the day of surgery for 
those subjects  who can only be screened on  the day of surgery) as described here.  During the screening visit, subjects  
will be assessed for  any past or present medical conditions  that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_426619].  
After the informed consent form  (ICF) is signed, a medical history, surgical history, physical  examination, 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram  (ECG), vital  sign measurements,  alcohol breath  test and urine drug screen,  and clinical laboratory  
tests (hematology and  chemistry)  will be performed.

Day of Surgery 
Pre-operative medications : Use of pre-operative analgesics  (eg, opi[INVESTIGATOR_375326],  acetaminophen, nonsteroidal  
anti-inflammatory  drugs [NSAIDs])  is prohibited.  
Eligible subjects will be randomized  in a blinded 1:1  ratio to either: 
• Group 1: EXPAREL+bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426620]  
• Group 2: Active bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426621] 1, prior to the C-section, all subjects will receive a intrathecal  injection of  150 mcg preservative -free 
morphine  for spi[INVESTIGATOR_315680] (eg,  Duramorph®) in conjunction with single -shot spi[INVESTIGATOR_426622] 1.4-1.6 mL 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.75%  and 15 mcg fentanyl.  If preservative -free morphine  for spi[INVESTIGATOR_315680] (eg, Duramorph)  is 
unavailable because of  a drug shortage, subjects  may instead receive  an intrathecal  injection of 75 mcg preservative - 
free hydromorphone  in conjunction  with single-shot spi[INVESTIGATOR_426622] 1.4-1.6 mL bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]  0.75% and 
15 mcg fentanyl. A combined  spi[INVESTIGATOR_196613] (CSE) anesthesia  technique  may also be used provided the epi[INVESTIGATOR_426623]. Subjects who receive the epi[INVESTIGATOR_426624].  
Intraoperative medications: The intraoperative  use of the following medications  is discouraged, but  may be permitted 
if clinically indicated based on the investigator’s  discretion (all medications  must be appropriately  recorded [ie, drug, 
dose, and  route of administration]):  ketamine and midazolam (Versed®). Prophylactic  use of dexamethasone for  
prevention of nausea  and vomiting  is prohibited.  
After delivery of the baby [CONTACT_426713],  a small amount of lidocaine (<2 mL) may be administered  
subcutaneously to form a skin wheal over the area of the needle insertion site. A 2-point classic TAP block,  in 2 steps 
(see below), must be performed under ultrasound guidance  and must be performed  no more than 90 minutes after skin 
incision closure of the C-section. A confirmatory  ultrasound pi[INVESTIGATOR_426625].  
TAP infiltration:  The TAP infiltration  includes two steps: (1) TAP needle  placement  and saline hydrodissection  and 
(2) study drug mixture  infiltration  into the TAP. Each step is briefly described below  for one side of the abdomen and 
must be repeated on the contralateral  side to complete the bilateral, 2-point TAP required for the study. For complete,  
step-by-step instructions on performing  the TAP infiltration under  ultrasound guidance,  please refer to the Pharmacy  
Binder. 
(1) TAP needle placement  and saline  hydrodissection: For  subjects in both study groups,  use ultrasound  guidance to 
place the TAP needle  into the desired  location and use a 10-mL syringe pre-filled with normal  saline to perform 
hydrodissection of the TAP. (Note: it is not necessary to use  the full 10 mL of normal saline  for hydodissection.)   
An ultrasound image  of the TAP needle must be captured after saline hydrodissection.  
(2) Study drug mixture infiltration  into the TAP: Subjects randomized  to the EXPAREL+bupi[INVESTIGATOR_124195]  (Group 
1) will receive 30  mL of a study drug mixture containing 10  mL EXPAREL  (133 mg) combined with 10  mL 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.25%  (25 mg) and 10 mL normal saline (total mixture 30 mL) infiltrated  into the TAP. An 
ultrasound  image of the TAP needle placement  must be captured after study drug infiltration.  
Subjects randomized  to the active bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426626] (Group 2) will  receive 30 mL of a study drug  mixture 
containing 10 mL bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39912] 0.25% (25 mg) combined with 20 mL normal saline (total  mixture 30 mL) 
infiltrated  into the TAP. An ultrasound image of the TAP needle  placement  must be captured after study drug 
mixture infiltration.  
Repeat the above steps on the contralateral  side to complete the bilateral, 2-point TAP required for the study.

Postsurgical Analgesia: Patient-controlled  analgesia  is not permitted.  
The following multimodal  pain regimen  will be used: 
At the time of skin incision closure (Note: it is very important  that these  be administered at the  time of wound closure 
and not prior to or before the end of surgery) 
• Intravenous (IV) ketorolac 15  mg (1 dose) 
• IV acetaminophen  1000 mg (1 dose) 
Beginning 6 hours after skin incision closure  
• Scheduled  oral (PO) acetaminophen 650 mg beginning  6 hours from the administration of  the single dose  of IV 
acetaminophen  at the end of surgery and then every 6 hours (q6h) for up to 72 hours or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]  
• Scheduled  PO ibuprofen [ADDRESS_539241] be recorded. 
Note: The scheduled  PO medication will  be administered  on a q6h schedule only through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47850].  
Rescue Medication : Subjects should only receive  opi[INVESTIGATOR_426627].  
Postsurgical  rescue medication will  comprise PO immediate -release oxycodone  (initiated at 5-10 mg every 4 hours 
[q4h] or as needed [PRN]). If a subject is unable to tolerate PO medication  or fails the PO oxycodone  rescue, IV 
morphine (initiated  at 1-2 mg) or hydromorphone  (initiated at  0.3-0.5 mg) may be administered q4h  or PRN. All 
surgical and postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_426628]  (pain medications)  administered  must be documented  through 
Day 14 postsurgery.  Additionally,  an unscheduled pain  intensity score using  a 10-cm visual analog scale  (VAS; see  
Appendix 1) must be completed  immediately prior  to any rescue  medication while  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
Permitted  medications for  the prevention and treatment of possible medication  side effects include the following  and 
may be used at the discretion of the study site principal investigator:  
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV immediately after  delivery of the baby. 
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV (should not exceed a maximum  of 12 mg in a 24-hour period)  for intraoperative and  
postoperative nausea  and vomiting  
• Metoclopramide 10 mg PO PRN for nausea  and vomiting 
• Nalbuphine IV 2.5  mg PRN for pruritus  
• Naloxone IV 50 -100 mcg PRN for pruritus.  
Postsurgical  Assessments  
Subjects will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_132966] 72 hours postsurgery.  Postsurgical  assessments  will include: 
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] • Subject's satisfaction with postsurgical  pain control (see 
• Time of first unassisted ambulation  Appendix 3) 
• Pain intensity scores using a 10-cm VAS • Overall benefit of anesthesia  score (OBAS) questionnaire  
(see Appendix 1) at rest  (see Appendix 4) 
• Discharge readiness (see Appendix 2) • Quality of recovery 15-item questionnaire (QoR -15; see 
Appendix 5)

While in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], subjects will be provided with a Patient Binder and will  use the binder to record all scheduled  
and unscheduled VAS scores.  For all scheduled  assessments  and unscheduled  assessments  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], subjects 
will assess, “How much pain are you experiencing  right now” and a vertical mark will  be placed  on the VAS line to 
indicate the level of pain experienced  at the time of assessment. If a subject is discharged  prior to a scheduled VAS  
assessment,  a member of the study site  staff will contact [CONTACT_426714], which will  be provided to the 
subject at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
At hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345],  the subject will be instructed  to record in the Participant  Diary VAS pain intensity score daily 
and all pain medications taken  following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426629]  14. 
At home,  the subject will  assess pain intensity at rest each day at noon (± 4 hours). This assessment  should capture 
her average pain  at rest in the prior 24 hours by [CONTACT_58833] “What  has been your  average pain  since your  last pain 
assessment?” (ie,  from noon on the previous  day to the current assessment).  At the same time, the subject should 
record any pain medication  (medication name,  date, time, and dose)  taken in the prior [ADDRESS_539243] has  
made any unscheduled phone  calls or office visits  related to pain; experienced  any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715]; or  
experienced  an emergency room  visit since hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  Adverse events (AEs)  and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) will be recorded from the time the ICF is signed through Day 14. 
Number of Subjects  (Planned) : Approximately  152 subjects are planned  for enrollment  into the study. Subjects who 
are withdrawn  or discontinued prior  to completing  the study may be replaced.

Duration of Subject Participation  in Study: 
Participation  will begin upon  signing of  the ICF. No more than 7 30 days should pass  between signing the ICF and 
surgery. A follow-up telephone  call will occur on Day 14 (± 3 days). Therefore,  each subject may participate  in the 
study for a maximum  of 44 47 days. 
Efficacy Assessments:  
The following efficacy  measurements  will be conducted  at the times specified after completion  of the last C-section 
wound incision stitch (ie, time of closure of the C-section wound): 
• Date, time of administration, and amount of all postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_426633] 14 
• Pain intensity scor es at rest using a 10-cm VAS at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 72 hours (see Appendix 1)  
and once daily (at noon ± 4 hours) through Day  14. † For pain intensity scores at 18, 24, 30, 36, or [ADDRESS_539248] is sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], do not wake her to assess pain. If she awakens within  the assessment window (ie, 1 hour 
for the 18- and 24-hour assessments and 2 hours for the  30-, 36-, and 42-hour assessments),  a pain score may be 
collected then. 
Please note that an unscheduled VAS  score is also required immediately prior  to administration of  any rescue  
medication while  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
• Date and time of first unassisted  ambulation  
• OBAS questionnaire  at 24, 48, and 72 hours (see Appendix 4).  † 
• Subject satisfaction with postsurgical pain  control (using a 5-point Likert scale) at 72 hours or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426634] (see Appendix 3) 
• Discharge  readiness at 24, 48, and [ADDRESS_539249] (see 
Appendix 2) 
• QoR-15 questionnaire at 72 hours  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (Appendix 5)  
• Unscheduled phone  calls or office visits related to pain after discharge  through Day  14 
†If a subject is discharged prior to  any of the scheduled VAS assessments  collected at [ADDRESS_539250] at the appropriate  scheduled  times (ie, the time of each assessment  scheduled  to be collected that occurs after 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345])  to remind her  to complete the VAS and OBAS assessments  and to record the scheduled  
assessments  in the Participant  Diary. This will ensure that for any subject discharged prior  to [ADDRESS_539251] is discharged prior to 72 hours. 
Efficacy Endpoints:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the total postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_426635]  72 hours. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints  include: 
• Time to first postsurgical  opi[INVESTIGATOR_426636]  
• The VAS pain  intensity scores  (at rest) from 0 6 to 72 hours 
• Percentage of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-free subjects through 72 h ours

• The VAS pain intensity scores (at  rest) from 6 to 12 hours, 6 to 24 hours,  6 to 48 hours,  24 to 48 hours, and 48 
to 72 hours. 
• Integrated  rank assessment  using the VAS pain intensity score (at rest) at 24,  48, and 72 hours and  the total 
amount of postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_426637] 24, 48,  and 72 hours.  
• OBAS at each assessed timepoint.  
• Time spent in the post-anesthesia  care unit (PACU).  
• Time to first unassisted  ambulation.  
• Proportion of  subjects meeting  Modified Postanesthesia Discharge Scoring  System criteria for discharge  
readiness at each assessed timepoint.  
• Overall assessment of the subject’s satisfaction with postsurgical pain  control (using  a 5-point Likert scale)  at 
72 hours after surgery (or at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426638] 72 hours). 
• Responses to  the QoR-15 questionnaire  at 72 hours after  surgery (or at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426639] 
72 hours). 
• Number of unscheduled phone  calls or office visits related to pain from  discharge  through Day 14. 
Safety Assessments : 
Adverse events (AEs/SAEs)  will be recorded from  the time the ICF is signed through Day 14. 
Safety Endpoints:  
Incidence of AEs/SAEs  that start after the start of anesthesia  through Day 14.  
Statistical  Methods:  
A comprehensive  statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed  for this study. Demographic  and baseline  
characteristics  will be summarized descriptively  by [CONTACT_426715].  
Efficacy endpoint analyses will  be described in  the SAP. 
Safety endpoints  will be summarized  descriptively  by [CONTACT_1570].  
Sample size for this study was based on Quale  et al (2016). The coefficient  of variation (CV) from this poster was 
approximately 60%.  Assuming  a log-normal distribution  for total opi[INVESTIGATOR_426640] a 60% CV, 5% alpha, a 
1:1 randomization ratio, and 80%  power, a total of [ADDRESS_539253] a 30% 
difference between treatments.  Assuming  5% of the subjects are not  evaluable,  a total sample size of  approximately  
[ADDRESS_539254] completed  the 72-hour follow -up for the primary  efficacy assessments.  The 
objective of this interim analysis is three-fold: (1) to stop the trial for futility if it is improbable  to show a significant  
reduction  in the primary efficacy endpoints; (2)  to stop the trial for early success if a clear benefit is demonstrated;  and 
(3) to allow for the possibility  of increasing  the study sample size if the original  sample size assumptions are  
determined  to be not viable. Full details and all thresholds for  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_426641] a 
prospective  interim analysis plan that will become part of the study SAP.

7. INTRODUCTION  
7.1. Indication  
EXPAREL® was developed  to extend pain relief with a single dose  administration  without the  
use of indwelling  catheters and to decrease the requirement for supplemental opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007].  
It is indicated for use as an analgesic injected  into the surgical site for postsurgical pain relief.  
Effective postsurgical  pain control is a critical element in patient recovery following surgery,  
as the majority of patients may experience significant  pain, particularly  in the first few days. 
Improved  postsurgical  pain management  contributes to better healing, faster patient mobilization,  
shortened hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], and reduced healthcare  costs (American  Society of Anesthesiologists  
Task Force on Pain Management 1995). 
7.2. Current Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/Treatments  
Current modalities of postoperative analgesia include  wound infiltration with local anesthetics  
combined  with the systemic administration  of analgesics (multimodal  therapy). Multimodal  
therapy usually includes opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], which  have considerable drawbacks including time 
and resources required for monitoring  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related side effects.  A reduction in the use of  
postoperative  opi[INVESTIGATOR_426652]-induced 
adverse effects, such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_2477],  nausea, vomiting,  constipation, somnolence,  
pruritus, and urinary retention.  
With over 70 million surgeries performed  annually in  the US, postoperative  pain is a ubiquitous  
condition  among our population.  While it is a predictable  component of the postoperative  
process, such pain is often poorly managed,  resulting in clinical and physiological changes that 
increase morbidity and mortality (inability to ambulate early, etc), diminish quality of life,  
and extend length of stay, thereby [CONTACT_426716][INVESTIGATOR_40496] (Oderda 2007) and reducing  
patient satisfaction.  Effective relief of acute pain with minimal opi[INVESTIGATOR_40497],  on the 
other hand, may improve clinical outcomes, avoid complications  (like delay in regaining bowel  
function or an inability to tolerate liquid and solid oral intake, etc.), and conserve healthcare  
resources.  As such, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare  Organizations requires  
that all healthcare facilities  practice adequate pain  manageme nt and monitor opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related 
adverse events (AEs) (Apfelbaum  2003). 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_426653], and are currently considered the mainstay  
of treatment.   Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-only regimens are common and intravenous (IV) patient-controlled  
analgesia is a widely used delivery system for morphine sulfate.  Adverse events related to 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499]  (eg, nausea, vomiting,  ileus, confusion), however, represent one important  
reason that there is a need to develop opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -sparing strategies.  Indeed, fear of gastrointestinal  
side effects such as nausea and vomiting, as well as respi[INVESTIGATOR_2477],  present major 
limitations  for the widespread use of  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] (Chernin 2001 and Viscusi 2009).

Furthermore,  management  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related events often requires medical attention (eg, opi[INVESTIGATOR_182010],  antiemetic agents) and increased  pharmacy/nursing  time, which may raise healthcare  
expenses (Carroll 1994). 
7.3. EXPAREL  (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426654])  
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40501]-acting local anesthetics,  but even so it has a limited duration 
of action after local administration, usually reported as less than 8 hours. EXPAREL  (Pacira 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Parsippany,  New Jersey) is a bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426655].  
It consists of microscopic  spherical, multivesicular liposomes (DepoFoam® drug delivery  
system), organized  in a honeycomb -like structure comprising numerous non-concentric  internal 
aqueous chambers containing a bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426656] a concentration of 13.3 mg/mL.  Each 
chamber is separated from adjacent chambers  by [CONTACT_40562].  The lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805],  
cholesterol,  and triglycerides) are naturally occurring or close analogs of endogenous lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426657] a complex mechanism  involving  
reorganization of the barrier  lipid membranes and subsequent diffusion of the drug over an  
extended period of time. 
EXPAREL  was approved by [CONTACT_40563] 2011 for administration into the surgical site to 
produce postsurgical analgesia.  The active ingredient  (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) and inactive ingredient  
(DepoFoam)  of EXPAREL  are each contained, though separately,  in FDA-approved products: 
• Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338325], a well-characterized  anesthetic/analgesic,  with more than 
35 years of its use in the US. 
• DepoFoam,  a liposomal  extended-release formulation  contained in the marketed product 
DepoCyt® (1999).  The form  of DepoFoam  used in EXPAREL has  a slightly different  
mixture of lipid components  than that used in DepoCyt.  
7.4. Summary  of Human Experience  with EXPAREL  
Pacira has conducted  more than 36 clinical studies and one observational  follow-up study to 
investigate  EXPAREL.  Across these studies, over 1800 human subjects received EXPAREL  at 
doses ranging from 2 mg to 665 mg (equivalent to 2 mg to 750 mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974])  
administered by [CONTACT_40564]: local infiltration  into the surgical site, subcutaneous,  perineural  
(or “nerve block”), and epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873].  The product has been  generally well tolerated and, in active 
comparator studies, reported AEs occurred at a similar rate as the  corresponding bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426658].  
Across the entire clinical development  program, in doses up to [ADDRESS_539287] dose eval uated.

(SKY0402 -C-316 and SKY0402 -C-317) was demonstrated  across subgroups  of subjects with 
various prognostic features and across demographic  subgroups.  
Following the NDA submission  of EXPAREL, numerous clinical studies were conducted  in 
which EXPAREL was administered  via various routes of administration including infiltration  
into the transver sus abdominis plane (TAP) (Sterlicht 2014, Feierman 2014) and intraoperative  
wound infiltration or instillation.   Additionally,  as of June 2017, more than [ADDRESS_539289] received EXPAREL in the  postmarketing setting.

Screening  
Subjects will be screened within 7 30 days prior  to surgery; screening  on the day of surgery will 
be allowed but is discouraged.  If a subject can only be screened on the day of surgery, the 
informed consent process must still be started at least [ADDRESS_539291] be performed  and documented  within the 730-day time window (inclusive of the day  
of surgery for those subjects who can only be screened on the day of surgery) as described  here. 
During the screening  visit, subjects will be assessed for any past or present medical conditions  
that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_426660].  
After the ICF is signed, a medical history, surgical history, physical examination,  12-lead 
electrocardiogram  (ECG), vital  sign measurements,  clinical laboratory  tests (hematology and 
chemistry), alcohol breath test, and urine drug screen will be performed.  
Day of Surgery 
Pre-operative medications:  Use of pre-operative analgesics  (eg, opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007],  
acetaminophen,  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs])  is prohibited.  
Eligible subjects will be randomized  in a blinded 1:1 ratio to either: 
• Group 1: EXPAREL+bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426661]  
• Group 2: Active bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426662] 1, prior to the C-section, all subjects will receive a intrathecal  injection of 150 mcg 
preservative -free morphine  for spi[INVESTIGATOR_315680] (eg, Duramorph®) in conjunction  with single-shot 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_426622] 1.4-1.6 mL bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39912] 0.75% and 15 mcg fentanyl. If preservative - 
free morphine for spi[INVESTIGATOR_315680] (eg, Duramorph)  is unavailable because of a drug shortage,  
subjects may instead receive an intrathecal injection of 75 mcg preservative -free hydromorphone  
in conjunction with single-shot spi[INVESTIGATOR_426622] 1.4-1.6 mL bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.75% and 
15 mcg fentanyl. A combined spi[INVESTIGATOR_196613] (CSE) anesthesia technique may also be used 
provided the epi[INVESTIGATOR_426663]. Subjects who receive the epi[INVESTIGATOR_426664]. 
Intraoperative medications:  The intraoperative use of the following  medications  is discouraged,  
but may be permitted  if clinically indicated based on the investigator’s  discretion  (all 
medications must be appropriately  recorded [ie, drug, dose, and route o f administration]):  
ketamine and midazolam  (Versed®). Prophylactic use of dexamethasone  for prevention  of nausea  
and vomiting is prohibited.  
After delivery of the baby [CONTACT_426717], a small amount of lidocaine (<2 mL) 
may be administered  subcutaneously  to form a skin wheal over the area of the needle insertion  
site.  A 2-point classic TAP block, in 2 steps  (see below), must be performed under ultrasound  
guidance and must be performed  no more than 90  minutes after skin incision  closure of the

C- section. A confirmatory ultrasound  pi[INVESTIGATOR_426665]. 
TAP infiltration: The TAP infiltration  includes two steps: (1) TAP needle placement and saline 
hydrodissection  and (2) study drug mixture infiltration  into the TAP. Each step is briefly  
described below for one side of the abdomen and must be repeated on the contralateral side to  
complete the bilateral, 2 -point TAP required for the study. For complete, step-by-step 
instructions  on performing the TAP infiltration under ultrasound  guidance,  please refer to the 
Pharmacy  Binder. 
(1) TAP needle placement  and saline hydrodissection: For subjects in both study groups, use 
ultrasound  guidance to place the TAP needle into the desired  location and use a 10-mL 
syringe pre-filled with normal saline to perform  hydrodissection of the TAP.  (Note: it is  
not necessary to use the full 10 mL of normal saline for hydodissection.)  An ultrasound  
image of the TAP needle placement  must be captured after saline hydrodissection.  
(2) Study drug mixture infiltration into the TAP: Subjects randomized to the 
EXPAREL+bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426626] (Group 1) will receive 30 mL of a study drug mixture 
containing 10 mL EXPAREL  (133 mg) combined  with 10 mL bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.25% (25  
mg) and 10 mL normal saline (total mixture 30 mL) administered into the TAP.  An 
ultrasound image of the TAP needle placement must be captured after study drug 
infiltration.  
Subjects randomized to the active bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426626] (Group 2) will receive 30 mL of a 
study drug mixture containing  10 mL bupi[INVESTIGATOR_117610] e HCl 0.25% (25 mg) combined  with 
20 mL normal saline (total mixture 30 mL) administered  into the TAP. An ultrasound  
image of the TAP needle placement  must be captured after study drug mixture infiltration.  
Repeat the above steps on the contralateral  side to complete the bilateral, 2 -point TAP required  
for the study.  
Postsurgical Analgesia: Patient-controlled analgesia is not permitted  
The following  multimodal  pain regimen will be used:  
At the time of skin incision closure ( Note: it is ve ry important  that these be administered at the 
time of wound closure and not prior to or before the end of surgery) 
• Intravenous  (IV) ketorolac 15 mg (1 dose) 
• IV acetaminophen  1000 mg (1 dose)  
Beginning  6 hours after skin incision closure  
• Scheduled oral (PO) acetaminophen  650 mg beginning  6 hours from  the administration  of 
the single dose of IV acetaminophen  at the end of surgery and then every 6 hours (q6h) for 
up to 72 hours  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426666],  Inc.

• Scheduled PO ibuprofen [ADDRESS_539292] be recorded. Note: The scheduled PO medication  will be 
administered  on a q6h schedule only through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
Rescue Medication : Subjects should only receive opi[INVESTIGATOR_426667]. Postsurgical  rescue medication  will comprise PO immediate -release 
oxycodone (initiated at 5 -10 mg every 4 hours [q4h]  or as needed [PRN]). If a subject is unable  
to tolerate PO medication  or fails the PO oxycodone  rescue, IV morphine  (initiated at 1-2 mg) or 
hydromorphone  (initiated at 0.3 -0.5 mg) may be administered  q4h or PRN. All surgical and  
postsurgical  opi[INVESTIGATOR_40478] (pain medications) administered must be documented  
through Day 14 postsurgery. Additionally, an unscheduled pain intensity score using a 10-cm 
visual analog scale (VAS; see Appendix  1) must be completed  immediately  prior to any rescue  
medication while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Permitted  medications  for the prevention  and treatment  of possible medication  side effects 
include the following and may be administered  at the discretion of t he study site principal  
investigator:  
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV immediately after delivery of the baby. 
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV (should not exceed a maximum  of 12 mg in a 24 -hour period) for  
intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting 
• Metoclopramide  10 mg PO PRN for nausea and vomiting 
• Nalbuphine  IV 2.5 mg PRN for pruritus 
• Naloxone  IV 50-100 mcg PRN  for pruritus. 
Postsurgical Assessments  
Subjects will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_132966] 72  hours after surgery.  Postsurgical assessments  
will include: 
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]  
• Time of first unassisted ambulation  
• Pain intensity scores at rest  using a 10-cm VAS (see Appendix  1) 
• Discharge  readiness (see Appendix  2) 
• Subject’s satisfaction with postsurgical pain control (see Appendix  3) 
• Overall benefit of anesthesia score  (OBAS) questionnaire  (see Appendix  4) 
• The Quality of recovery 15-item questionnaire  (QoR-15; see Appendix  5) 
A phone call will be made to each subject on Day [ADDRESS_539293] made any unscheduled phone calls or office visits related to pain;

experienced  any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715];  or experienced an emergency  room visit since hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426634].  Adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded from the time the 
ICF is signed through Day 14.  Any concomitant  medications  to treat AEs  through Day [ADDRESS_539294] Participation  
Participation  will begin at the signing of the ICF.  No more than 7 30 days should pass between  
signing of the ICF and performance  of the surgery.  The time from study drug administration  
through the end of participation  is 14 ± 3 days.  Therefore,  subjects may participate  in the study 
for up to 44 47 days. 
9.1.2. Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_426668], the investigator,  or officials from  regulatory authorities discover conditions  during the 
study that indicate that the study or study site should be terminated,  this action may be taken 
after Pacira has consulted  with appropriate regulatory authorities  and notified the  investigator(s).  
The Pacira Medical Monitor and Pharmacovigilance  team review all SAEs reported from  Pacira 
clinical studies on an ongoing basis and in real time (ie, as the events are reported).  The Medical 
Monitor is responsible  for temporarily halting  the study if the type, frequency, or  
seriousness /severity of such events suggests a potential  threat to the safety of the study 
participants.  If such action is taken, a thorough review of all available data will be conducted.  
Based on the results of this review and discussions with investigators  and/or regulatory  
authorities as warranted, the study may be restarted  or permanently terminated.  
In addition, any death will be thoroughly reviewed and appropriate action taken.  
9.2. Discussion  of Study Design 
EXPAREL is approved for infiltration  into a surgical wound.  This Phase -4, multicenter,  
double-blind study will evaluate the efficacy and  safety of EXPAREL+bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426669] C -section. The double -blind study design  
is intended to avoid potential bias resulting from subject or investigator  knowledge of the  
assigned treatment.  
The physiology of pain involves multiple complex pathways  and mechanisms and the successful  
management  of pain requires the use of a combination of pain medications  in a “balanced” or  
multimodal approach to achieve a state of balanced analgesia (White 2010).  
The practice  of multimodal  analgesia is being adopted across different  patient-care pathways and 
is becoming  the standard of care at major surgery centers globally. There is quite a variety of 
options of  medications  within the multimodal  approach either in different combinations  or when 
used alone. In all cases, the goal is to reduce postoperative pain associated with surgery and

reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_426670]-related adverse events. In some cases, such an approach may also 
reduce the average length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (Elvir-Lazo 2010). 
EXPAREL  (liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319])  is an amide local anesthetic  indicated for single -dose 
infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical  analgesia.  This study is designed to 
assess the effectiveness of EXPAREL  administered  as a TAP in a multimodal  setting to reduce 
total postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556].  All subjects in the study will be eligible to receive an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_11595],  if needed, to control breakthrough  postsurgical  pain as part of the multimodal  
approach to pain management.  
10. STUDY POPULATION

count less than 80, 000 × 103/mm3 or international  normalized ratio greater than 1.5) 
9. Concurrent  painful physical condition  that may require analgesic treatment (such as 
long-term, consistent use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) in the postsurgical  period for pain  that is not strictly  
related to the surgery and which may confound the postsurgical assessments.  
10. Clinically  significant  medical disease in either the mother or baby [INVESTIGATOR_24565], in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13046],  would make participation  in a clinical study inappropriate.  This includes 
any psychiatric or other disease in the mother that would constitute  a contraindication  to 
participation in the study or cause the mother to be unable to comply with the study 
requirements.  
11. History of, suspected, or known  addiction to or abuse of illicit drug(s), prescription  
medicine(s), or alcohol within the past [ADDRESS_539297]’s participation in this study 
13. Previous participation in an EXPAREL  study. 
In addition, the subject will be ineligible  to receive study drug and will be withdrawn from 
the study if she meets the following criteria during surgery:  
14. Any clinically significant  event or condition uncovered during the surgery (eg, excessive  
bleeding, acute sepsis) that might render the subject medically  unstable or complicate  the 
subject’s postsurgical  course. 
15. Receives the epi[INVESTIGATOR_426672]. 
10.3. Removal  of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment  
Every reasonable  effort shall be made to maintain subject compliance  and participation  in the 
study. Reasons for discontinuation  of any subject from  the study will be recorded. 
If any clinically significant  event or condition is uncovered during the surgery (eg, excessive  
bleeding, acute sepsis) the subject should be withdrawn from study and the event or condition  
should be reported as  an AE or SAE.  
Pacira Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
EXPAREL® 402-C-411 (C-Section TAP)  
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_539298]’s study participation can be terminated in a safe and 
orderly manner. If such a subject discontinues  prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345],  all assessments  to be 
conducted at 72 hours/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426673].  
If such a subject discontinues following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47850], all information  captured in the  
Patient Participant Diary should be collected and  a final telephone call for safety should be made. 
Any subject who discontinues because of an AE  should be instruc ted to notify the study  
personnel  of any abnormalities  and to come to the study site if  medical evaluation is needed and  
the urgency of the situation permits. Any subject exhibiting undesirable  side effects will receive 
appropriate  treatment at the discretion of the investigator  until resolution of the effect.  
This study involves a single infiltration  of study drug; therefore,  subjects should not be  
terminated  from the ongoing study assessments  as long as they are willing  and able to continue 
with the follow -up schedule according  to the protocol.  For emergencies  and other unscheduled  
visits to a medical facility other than the study site, medical records must be obtained by [CONTACT_426718]’s case report form (CRF). 
10.3.2. Voluntary  or Study Investigator  Withdrawal  
Subjects are free to discontinue  from the study at any time, without prejudice to future treatment.  
A subject may be discontinued  from the study if she  refuses EXPAREL  infiltration  or refuses to 
comply with study procedures. Subjects should  be encouraged to complete the study safety  
assessments.   Reasons for discontinuation from  the study will be recorded.  
If a subject is discontinued by  [CONTACT_426719], the subject will  be asked to complete a final evaluation  so that she can be 
withdrawn  in a safe and orderly manner. If such a subject discontinues  prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954], all assessments  to be conducted at  72 hours/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426674].  If such a subject discontinues following  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], all  
information  captured in the Participant Diary should be collected and a final telephone  call for 
safety should be made. 
After termination  from the study, the subject may be followed for safety including monitoring  of 
AEs through Day 14.

[ADDRESS_539301] be 
immediately  withdrawn from  the study.  
The TAP infiltration includes two steps: (1)  TAP needle placement and saline hydrodissection  
and (2) study drug mixture infiltration into the TAP. Each step is briefly described below for one  
side of the abdomen and must be repeated on the  contralateral side to complete the bilateral, 2- 
point TAP required for the study. For complete, step -by-step instructions  on performing  the TAP

CONFIDENTIAL  37 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
20 mL normal saline (total mixture 30 mL) administered into the TAP. An ultrasound  
image of the TAP needle placement  must be captured after study drug mixture infiltration.  
Repeat the above steps on the contralateral  side to complete the bilateral, [ADDRESS_539302] package insert (see also Section 11.1.2). 
11.1.2. EXPAREL  Administration  Considerations  
Because of the potential risk of severe adverse effects associated  with the administration of 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], the study sites must be equipped to  manage subjects with any evidence of cardiac,  
neurological, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_312530].  
Administration  of additional  local anesthetics,  including lidocaine,  is prohibited  and no agents 
other than bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39912] 0.25% in [ADDRESS_539303] if the vial has been open for more than 4 hours.  
In order to prevent EXPAREL from  settling, gently inverting and re-inverting the syringe prior  
to administration  is recommended.  
11.1.3. Intrathecal  Morphine/Hydromorphone  Administration  
Considerations  
The most serious adverse experience encountered  during administration of intrathecal  morphine/  
hydromorphone,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_426675]/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374],  may be severe and could 
require intervention.   Naloxone  injection and  resuscitative equipment  should be immediately  
available for administration  in case of  life-threatening or intolerable  side effects and whenever  
intrathecal  morphine/ hydromorphone  therapy is being initiated.  
Intrathecal  morphine/  hydromorphone is contraindicated in patients  with medical conditions that  
would preclude the administration  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_426676], including  an allergy to morphine/  
hydromorphone or other opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], acute bronchial  asthma, or upper airway obstruction.  
Morphine/  hydromorphone, like all opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], may cause severe hypotension  in 
individuals  whose ability to maintain blood pressure is compromised by a depleted blood volume 
or a concurrent administration  of drugs, such  as phenothiazines  or general anesthetics.  
11.2. Identity of the Investigational  Products  
11.2.1. Description  of EXPAREL  
EXPAREL  (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426613])  is formulated as a sterile, 
non-pyrogenic,  white to off-white, preservative -free homogenous  suspension of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426677],  Inc. 
EXPAREL® 402-C-411 (C-Section TAP)  
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  38 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
encapsulated into multivesicular liposomes (the DepoFoam  drug delivery system). Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426678] a nominal concentration  of 13.3 mg/mL. For the purposes of this study, EXPAREL  
will be provided in 20 mL, 1.3% (13.3 mg/mL) single-use, clear glass vials.  EXPAREL vials  
should be stored refrigerated between 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  
11.2.2. Description  of Reference  Product 
The reference product is 20 mL bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39912] 0.25% and 40 mL normal saline (total volume 
60 mL) administered  as an infiltration into the TAP under  ultrasound  guidance after spi[INVESTIGATOR_57273].  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39917] a long-acting local anesthetic,  used for surgical anesthesia  and 
acute pain management.  It is an alternative  to NSAIDs and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
11.3. Method of Assigning  Subjects to Treatment  
11.3.1. Randomization  Scheme 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_539304] is identified as  being qualified for the study in accordance with the eligibility  
criteria (see Section 10.1 and Section 10.2), and is at the study site for surgery, the unblinded 
research pharmacist or designee will obtain a randomization  assignment.  The subject will be 
considered randomized  into the study once  the study treatment  assignment  is received.  
11.3.3. Replacement  of Subjects 
Subjects who withdraw from  the study before  being randomized  may be replaced.  Once 
assigned, subject numbers will not be reused; subjects enrolled to replace those who withdraw  
will be assigned a unique subject number. 
11.4. Selection  of Doses in the Study 
During the clinical development  of EXPAREL,  single doses ranging from [ADDRESS_539305] shown that because 
EXPAREL releases bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426679], administration  of 
EXPAREL  266 mg results in a maximum  plasma concentration (Cmax) equivalent  to that seen 
with standard bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] [ADDRESS_539306] shown that for wound infiltration a  
total dose of 266 mg (20 mL) of  EXPAREL is safe and efficacious.  Based on this experience,  
the FDA-approved marketed dose of 266 mg was deemed appropriate for this study.  
Intrathecal preservative -free morphine  for spi[INVESTIGATOR_426680] (eg, Duramorph) is commonly used 
during C-section, usuall y at a dose between 0.1  mg and 0.2 mg (Sviggum 2106). The midpoint of

0.15 mg (150 mcg) is preferred by [CONTACT_426720] (which may be shorter with a lower  dose) and incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related adverse  
events such as nausea and vomiting (which may increase with  a higher dose). If preservative -free 
morphine  for spi[INVESTIGATOR_315680] (eg, Duramorph) is unavailable because of  a drug shortage,  
preservative -free hydrom orphone may  also be used in C -section, usually at a dose  that is 50% 
lower than that for intrathecal  morphine. The study dose of 0.15 mg (150 mcg) of intrathecal  
morphine or 0.075 mg (75 mcg) of intrathecal  hydromorphone  is also supported  by a recent 
dose-finding study that sought to determine  the effective analgesic dose for 90% of patients  
(ED90) for both intrathecal morphine  and hydromorphone in patient undergoing C -section 
(Sviggum  2106). 
11.5. Blinding 
11.5.1. Blinding Procedures  
To maintain the double -blind study design,  only the unblinded  study personnel  who are NOT 
involved with protocol -specific, postsurgical assessments  may prepare and administer  the study 
drug. Staff members conducting study -specific, postsurgical  assessments and the subjects will 
remain blinded to the assigned treatment throughout  the study.  If a subject experiences an SAE,  
Pacira will only unblind the subject’s treatment if doing so is necessary  to manage the treatment 
of the SAE.  Expedited SAEs will be unblinded by [CONTACT_426721].  
At each site,  only the designated  unblinded  pharmacist  will receive the unblinded randomization  
assignments  and be responsible for preparing study drug.  
Assignment  of blinded and unblinded  responsibili ties regarding the preparation of study drug  
should take into account that EXPAREL must be administered within [ADDRESS_539307] occurred prior to administration.  
The individuals preparing and administering  study drug will not  be allowed to perform  any of 
the study assessments or reveal the assigned study treatment  to any other members of the study  
team at any time. The infiltration of study drug  will be recorded using the minimal amount of 
information  necessary  to avoid unblinding staff who will be participating  in blinded procedures  
(see Pharmacy Binder for additional  details). 
No crossover will be permitted  between the blinded and unblinded study site personnel  during 
the study period.  The assignment  of site monitors will also be segregated.   Blinded monitors will  
review CRFs, clinic charts, and all other study-related document s that do not disclose the 
allocation of  study treatment.  Care should be taken in recording and review of operating room  
records to not record information in an unblinded  fashion. Pharmacy or any other clinic records 
providing  unblinded  information (eg, randomization, study drug preparation, study drug  
accountability,  study drug infiltration)  will be reviewed by [CONTACT_426722].  
Pacira Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
EXPAREL® 402-C-411 (C-Section TAP)  
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_539308] safety warrants such unblinding.  However,  if possible, the 
investigator  should discuss the safety issues with the Pacira Medical Monitor before attempting  
such unblinding.  Any unblinding will be documented  through immediate notification  of the 
Pacira study team  and the investigator withi n the interactive  response technology (IRT) system 
used for randomization.  The reason for unblinding  will be documented.  Any accidental  
unblinding events (ie, through mishaps in the operating room  or miscommunication  among study  
staff) must be reported  to Pacira immediately.  
Any unblinding  performed  through the randomization system  will be recorded as a transaction  
and the appropriate  study personnel will be notified that such a transaction  occurred.  
Any incidence(s) of unblinding will be noted in the clinical study  report with a full discussion of  
the events leading to the decision to unblind. 
11.6. Prior and Concomitant  Therapy and Medications  
11.6.1. Prior Therapy and Medications  
Use of any of the following medications within the  times specified before surgery is prohibited:  
long-acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536], NSAIDs, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (except for low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_426681]), or acetaminophen  within 3 days, or any opi[INVESTIGATOR_426682] 24 hours.  
Initiation of  treatment with any of  the following medications is prohibited  within 1 month of 
study drug administration  or if the medication(s)  are being given to control pain: SSRIs, SNRIs,  
gabapentin,  pregabalin  (Lyrica), or duloxetine  (Cymbalta).  If a subject is taking one of these 
medications for a reason other than pain control, she must be on a stable dose for at least 1 month 
prior to study drug administration.  
11.6.2. Restricted  Therapy and Medications  During Surgery 
As described in the EXPAREL  package insert,  no agents are to be admixed with EXPAREL  
(eg, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], dexamethasone, clonidine)  other than bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  Lidocaine and other local 
anesthetics are not permitted to be locally administered  during the surgery because they are 
known to interact with EXPAREL resulting in the displacement  of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426683]. When a topi[INVESTIGATOR_426684], the solutions are  not to 
come in contact [CONTACT_40568] (eg, the area must be dry before EXPAREL is administered).  
Upon discovering  use of any prohibited therapy and/or medication during or after surgery, the  
investigator  should document all events that led to the deviation,  write a note to file, and notify 
the Pacira Medical Monitor accordingly.

11.6.3. Permitted  Therapy or Medications after Surgery 
Patient-controlled analgesia  is not permitted.  
The following  multimodal  pain regimen will be used:  
At the time of skin incision closure ( Note: it is very important  that these be administered at the 
time of wound closure and not prior to or before the end of surgery.) 
• Intravenous  (IV) ketorolac 15 mg (1 dose) 
• IV acetaminophen  1000 mg (1 dose)  
Beginning  6 hours after skin incision closure  
• Scheduled PO acetaminophen  650 mg beginning  6 hours from the administration  of the 
single dose of IV acetaminophen at the end of surgery and then q6h f or up to 72 hours or  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]  
• Scheduled PO ibuprofen [ADDRESS_539309] for breakthrough pain.  
Postsurgical rescue medication  will comprise PO immediate -release oxycodone (initiated at  
5-10 mg q4h or PRN). If a subject is unable to tolerate PO medication  or fails the PO oxycodone  
rescue, IV morphine (initiated at 1 -2 mg) or hydromorphone  (initiated at 0.3-0.5 mg) may be 
administered  q4h or PRN.  Patient-controlled analgesia is not permitted.  All surgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_426685]  (pain medications)  administered  must be 
documented  through Day 14 postsurgery.  Additionally,  an unscheduled  pain intensity score 
using the VAS (see Appendix 1) must be completed immediately prior to any rescue medication  
while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Permitted  medications  for the prevention  and treatment  of possible medication  side effects 
include the following and may be administered  at the discretion of the study site principal  
investigator:  
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV immediately after delivery of the baby. 
• Ondansetr on 4 mg IV (should not exceed a maximum  of 12 mg in a 24 -hour period) for  
intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting 
• Metoclopramide  10 mg PO PRN for nausea and vomiting 
• Nalbuphine IV 2.5 mg as needed PRN for pruritus  
• Naloxone  IV 50-100 mcg PRN  for pruritus.

inventory  records.  At a minimum,  the investigator  or designee will maintain accurate records 
demonstrating  dates and units of drug received, lot numbers, subjects to whom  drug was 
administered,  and accounts of any drug destroyed accidentally or deliberately.  The investigator  
must retain vials containing  used, unused, or expi[INVESTIGATOR_426686], as 
instructed by [CONTACT_40574], following confirmation  of drug accountability data  by a study monitor. 
A record of  drug return or destruction  will be maintained and provided to Pacira. Inventory  
records must be readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_68601]/or appropriate  
regulatory authorities at any time. A copy of the inventory records, drug accountability  
information, and notice of return or destruction  will be returned to Pacira at the end of the study.

hours for the 30 -, 36-, and 42-hour assessments),  a pain score may be collected then. See Section 
13.1.1 regarding subjects discharged prior to 72 hours. 
To assess pain intensity (VAS) at rest, the subject should rest quietly in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_426693] 3-5 minutes before entering the pain 
score. 
13.1.3. Overall Benefit of Analgesia  Score Questionnaire  
The OBAS questionnaire  (Lehmann  2010; see Appendix 4) will be completed at 24, 48, and 72 
hours. See Section 13.1.1 regarding  subjects discharged prior to 72 hours.

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_539323]’s satisfaction  with postsurgical pain control will be assessed at 72 hours (or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954], whichever occurs first; see Appendix 3).  
13.1.5. Discharge  Readiness  
The subject’s discharge readiness  will be assessed using the Modified  Postanesthesia  Discharge  
Scoring System criteria (Chung 1995a; Chung 1995b; see Appendix 2).  The discharge readine ss 
assessment  will be used for data collection only and is not intended to interfere with the 
investigational site’s policy for determining  when the subject should be discharged from  the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Discharge  readiness will be assessed at 24, 48, and [ADDRESS_539324]’s quality of recovery  will be assessed using the QoR-15 questionnaire  at 72 hours, 
(or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345],  whichever occurs fi rst; see Appendix 5).  
13.2. Obtaining  Informed  Consent 
Potential participants may provide informed consent up to [ADDRESS_539325] all her questions  answered by [CONTACT_093]/study staff prior to 
providing  informed consent. Screening procedures  that are standard of care (SOC) at the 
institution may be completed  prior to written informed consent. Any screening procedures that  
are not SOC, must be completed after written informed consent is  provided and prior to surgery. 
(see Section 13.3). 
13.3. Screening/Baseline  Procedures  
Subjects will be screened within  30 days prior to surgery; screening  on the day of surgery will be  
allowed but is discouraged.  If a subject can only be screened on  the day of surgery, the informed 
consent process must still be started at least [ADDRESS_539326] be performed  and documented  within the  30-day time window (inclusive  of the day of 
surgery for those subjects who can only be screened on the day of surgery) as described here.

14. ADVERSE  EVENT REPORTING  
Consistent  with the current regulatory guidance provided by [CONTACT_426724],  
AE and SAE are defined in Section 14.1.[ADDRESS_539332] of the study, those SAEs that may 
require expedited  reporting to regulatory authorities.  
14.1. Adverse Events 
14.1.1. Definitions  
Definition  of Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward  medical occurrence associated  with the use of  
a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug  related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse 
experience)  can be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (eg, abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated  with the use of a drug, without any judgment  about 
causality.  An AE can arise from  any use of  the drug (eg, off-label use in combination with 
another drug) and from  any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
An AE can be any unfavorable  and unintended change in a body structure or body function. 
Adverse events include any clinically significant  deterioration  of a subject’s medical status. 
The AE may involve any organ or system  and can be represented  by [CONTACT_426725] a disease, a syndrome, a symptom,  a physical sign, as well as by [CONTACT_426726].  Any medically relevant and untoward  
change after the subject signs the ICF, including frequency or pattern changes for a fluctuating 
condition (eg, migraine)  is considered an AE.  
An AE that occurs after the ICF has been signed and before the start of the study drug 
administration  is identified as a pretreatment AE (PTAE). An AE that occurs after the 
administration  of a study treatment  is considered a TEAE.  
Pacira Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
EXPAREL® 402-C-411 (C-Section TAP)  
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  51 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
Definition of Adverse R eaction: Any AE caused by a  drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected  adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. 
Definition of Suspected Adverse R eaction: Any AE  for which there is a  reasonable possibility  
that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of investigational new drug (IND) safety 
reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is  evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE. A suspected  adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about caus ality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  Suspected adverse  
reactions are a subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable  possibility  that the drug caused 
the event. 
14.1.2. Recording  Adverse Events 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs (ie, PTAEs and TEAEs) with an  
onset after the subject signs the ICF. For the purpose of this  study, all AEs that occur through 
Day [ADDRESS_539333] be recorded regardless  of whether or not they a re considered related to  
study drug. Whenever  feasible, AE terms should be documented  as medical diagnoses (highest  
possible level of integration);  otherwise, the AEs should be reported separately  as individual  
signs or symptoms.  Only one AE per line should be recorded in the AE CRF; for example, an  
AE of nausea and  vomiting should be listed as two separate  events: the event of nausea and the 
event of vomiting.   If a diagnosis  is established  after symptoms  are recorded on the AE CRF, 
the diagnosis  should be recorded and the symptoms  collapsed (removed;  ie, lined through and  
initialed).  Whenever  possible, abnormal  laboratory results should  be reported as their clinical 
corollary (eg, low potassium  should be recorded as hypokalemia).  
A continuous AE with varying grades of severity  must be recorded as one AE.  The highest  
grade of severity experienced by [CONTACT_426727]. 
Any condition  noted before the subject signs the ICF will be listed as Medical History and is 
considered a pre-existing condition.  If a pre-existing condition changes (ie, becomes more 
severe or more frequent) at any time after the ICF is signed, or after study drug administration,  
it is considered an AE. Note: A change in treatment for a pre-existing condition  (eg, new high 
blood pressure medication),  does not necessarily  indicate an AE. 
Information  recorded on the AE CRF will include the AE term, the date and time of onset, 
severity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, action taken for  
the AE, and the outcome of the AE, including  the date and time of resolution,  if applicable.  
14.1.3. Severity of Adverse Events 
The severity of an AE must be categorized using the following guidelines:  
Mild: An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal 
discomfort  and not interfering with everyday activities.  
Pacira Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
EXPAREL® 402-C-411 (C-Section TAP)  
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  52 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
Moderate: An AE that is discomforting  and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
Severe: An AE that prevents normal everyday activities.  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial  infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as "serious," which is based  
on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually  associated  with events that pose a threat to a 
subject's life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory  
reporting obligations.  
14.1.4. Relationship  of Adverse Events to Study Drug 
The investigator  must assess the relationship  of the AE to study drug after careful medical 
consideration  on a case-by-case basis.  General guidelines  for determining  the AE’s causality to 
the study drug are provided below.  
Unrelated: A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE can be  
easily ruled out (eg, based on the temporal sequence, absence of a 
reasonable pathophysiological mechanism,  or direct evidence of  
actual cause).  
Unlikely: A clinical event with a temporal relationship to study drug 
administration  which makes a causal relationship improbable  and in 
which other drugs, chemicals,  or underlying  disease provide a 
plausible explanation;  
Possible: A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration  
of the study drug but which could also be explained by a concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals;  
Probable:  A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration  
of the study drug unlikely to be attributed to a  concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals and which follows a clinically reasonable  
response on withdrawal  (dechallenge); or 
Definite: The pharmacological properties  of the study drug(s) or of the  
substance  class, and the course of the AE after dechallenge and, if 
applicable, after rechallenge, and/or specific test indicate 
involvement of the study drug(s) in the occurrence/worsening of the  
AE, and no indication of other causes exists.  
14.1.5. Outcome  of Adverse Events 
The investigator will assess the  outcome of the AE  after careful medical consideration, on a  
case-by-case basis.  General guidelines  are provided below:  
Pacira Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
EXPAREL® 402-C-411 (C-Section TAP)  
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  53 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
Recovered/Resolved:  The event resolved and the subject recovered  from the AE. 
 
Recovered/Resolved  
with Sequelae:  
Not Recovered/  
Not Resolved:  The initial event resolved, but has a continuing abnormal condition  
as a result of the AE. 
At the time of last assessment, the event was ongoing, with an 
undetermined  outcome. Note: ongoing AEs are not to be considered  
resolved as a result of death. 
Recovering/Resolving : At the time of last assessment,  the event was decreasing  in 
frequency, severity, etc, and a resolution  was expected.  
Fatal: The AE directly caused death. 
Unknown:  There was an inability to access the subject or  the subject’s records  
to determine  the outcome (eg, subject withdrew consent or was  
lost to follow -up). 
14.1.6. Action Taken with Subject Because of an Adverse Event 
The investigator will provide any actions taken  regarding  the subject (eg, treatment, diagnostic  
tests, laboratory tests, or therapy) for each reported AE. 
• None 
• Medication  
• Non-pharmaceutical therapy (The specific therapy  used must be recorded in the 
CRF.) 
• Discontinued from  study 
• Other (The specific action taken must be recorded in the CRF.)  
14.2. Serious Adverse Events 
14.2.1. Definition  of a Serious Adverse Event 
Definition  of an SAE: An AE is considered  “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator  or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following  outcomes:  
• Death1 
• A life-threatening adverse event2 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]3 
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity4 
• Congenital  anomaly/birth defect 
• Medically  significant5

EXPAREL® 402-C-411 (C-Section TAP)  
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  54 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
1Death: Any event resulting in a subject’s death must be reported as an SAE.  However, death,  
in and of itself, is not an AE;  it is an outcome. The cause of death is the AE. Therefore,  the 
investigator  should make every effort to obtain and document  the cause of death for all subjects 
who die during the study. If, despi[INVESTIGATOR_321510], the cause of death remains unknown,  the AE 
should be documented  as an “unspecified fatal event.”  
2Life-threatening : An AE is considered  life-threatening  if, in the view of  either the investigator  
or Sponsor, its occurrence  places the subject at immediate  risk of death.  It does not include an 
AE that had it occurred in a more severe  form might have caused death.  
3Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] : It should be noted that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  in and of itself, does not represent an 
SAE.  It is the AE lead ing to the subject’s  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426703] “serious” when it 
requires inpatient care. Consequently,  an SAE should not be reported in case of preplanned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a pre-existing condition  that did not worsen during the study. However,  
any medical condition that delays a subject’s  discharge from  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (ie, prolonged  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) or requires the subject to be readmitted should be reported as an SAE.  
4Persistent  or significant incapacity : A substantial disruption of  a person’s ability to conduct  
normal life functions.  
5Medically  Significant : Important  medical events that may not result in death, be life- 
threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate  
medical judgment, they may jeopardize  the subject and may require medical or surgical  
intervention  to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medically  
significant  events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. 
14.2.2. Reporting  Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE or death that occurs at any time after the subject signs the ICF through Day 14,  
whether or not related to EXPAREL, must be reported by [CONTACT_426728] (drugsafety@pacira.c om) or fax to [ADDRESS_539334] be provided to Pacira  
Drug Safety or designee immediately.  The investigator will follow  all SAEs until resolved or the 
condition  stabilizes and further follow -up is not warranted.

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  55 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
If the investigator  is made aware of any SAEs after  Day 14, these should also be reported to 
Pacira Drug Safety or designee provided the SAE is considered  related to EXPAREL.  The site 
would then provide a completed SAE form  within 1 business day and the event would be 
followed until resolution, or until adequate stabilization  is met. 
15. STATISTICAL  METHODS  
A comprehensive statistical  analysis plan (SAP) will be developed for this study. 
15.1. Study Objective

(as well as the reasons for discontinuation)  will be displayed  by [CONTACT_1570]. 
15.6.3. Efficacy Analyses  
A comprehensive statistical  analysis plan (SAP) will be developed for this study. All efficacy 
endpoint analyses will be conducted  for the efficacy analysis set. The primary efficacy endpoint 
will also be analyzed using the per-protocol analysis set as a sensitivity  analysis. 
Summary  statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation,  minimum,  maximum)  will be shown  
for each continuous  measure of efficacy by [CONTACT_2948].  Number and percentage  of subjects  
in each category will be shown for each categorical  measure of efficacy by [CONTACT_1570]. For 
time to event measures of efficacy, medians and Kaplan-Meier estimates will be shown by 
[CONTACT_1570]. 
Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment  of a given endpoint prior to first dose of  
trial drug unless otherwise specified.  
All assessments will be listed in subject data listings.

The analyses of the secondary  efficacy endpoints  will be described in the SAP. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Tertiary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
The analyses of the tertiary efficacy  endpoints will be described in the SAP. 
15.6.4. Safety Analyses  
Adverse event verbatim terms will be mapped to preferred terms and related system/organ  class 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA).  All summaries of AEs will 
include AEs  that occur after the beginning  of anesthesia.  All summaries of AEs will be based on  
the safety analysis set. Events that start prior to anesthesia  will be identified  in listings only. 
Incidence rates of AEs after the  start of anesthesia  and the proportion  of subjects prematurely 
withdrawn  from the study due to an AE will be shown for each treatment  group. Incidence rates  
will also be shown for each treatment group for study drug-related AEs after the start of

All incidence  rates will be categorized  and shown by [CONTACT_57501]/organ class and preferred term. 
15.7. Significance  Testing 
Significance  testing will be described in the SAP.  
15.8. Interim Analyses  
An unblinded interim  analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_426729]  [ADDRESS_539338] completed the 72-hour 
follow-up for the primary efficacy assessments.   The objective of this interim analysis is three- 
fold: 
1. To stop the trial for futility if it is improbable to show a significant reduction in the 
primary efficacy endpoints;  
2. To stop the trial for early  success if a clear benefit is demonstrate d

threshold,  then the trial will terminate for futility.  A group sequential stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_426706]. If the trial stops early for neither success nor  
futility, predictive  probabilities  will be calculated  for the current maximum sample size (144 
treated subjects) and larger sample sizes up to 200 subjects. The sample size may be extended to  
a number that achieves higher predictive  probability of trial  success (Saville 2017). The final 
decision to stop, continue or increase the sample size will be made by [CONTACT_40574]. Full details and all

Appendix 1:  Subject’s Reported  Pain (Visual  Analog Scale) at Rest 
Subjects will be evaluated for  pain intensity scores at rest  using the 10-cm VAS at rest at 6, 12, 
18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 72 hours after surgery and then once daily (at noon ± 4 hours) through 
Day 14. For pain intensity scores at 18, 24, 30, 36, or [ADDRESS_539344] is sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], do not 
wake her to assess pain. If she awakens within the assessment window (ie, 1 hour for the 
18- and 24-hour assessments and 2 hours for the  30-, 36-, and 42-hour assessments),  a pain score  
may be collected then. 
If a subject is discharged prior to any of the scheduled  VAS assessments collected at [ADDRESS_539345] at the appropriate  
scheduled  times (ie, the time of each assessment  scheduled to  be collected  from 6 to 72 hours  
that occurs after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]) to remind her to complete the VAS assessment  and to record 
the scheduled  assessment  in the Participant Diary. This will ensure that for any subject 
discharged  prior to [ADDRESS_539346] an unscheduled VAS pain score immediately  
before any requested  opi[INVESTIGATOR_22388].  
To assess pain intensity (VAS) at rest, the subject should rest quietly in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_426693] 3-5 minutes before entering the pain 
score. 
While in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], subjects are to assess, “How much pain are you experiencing  right now?” 
and a vertical mark will be placed on  the line below to indicate the level of pain experienced at 
the time of assessment.  
At home, the subject will assess pain intensity at rest  each day at noon (± 4 hours). This 
assessment  should capture her average pain at rest in the prior 24 hours by [CONTACT_58833],  “What has 
been your average pain since your last pain assessment?” (ie, from noon on the previous day to  
the current assessment).

Appendix  2: Discharge  Readiness  
The subject’s discharge readiness  will be assessed using the Modified  Postanesthesia  Discharge  
Scoring System  below (Chung 1995a; Chung 1995b).  
 
The discharge  readiness assessment  will be used for data collection  only and is not intended to 
interfere with the investigational  site’s policy for determining when the subject should be  
discharged  from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
 
Discharge  readiness will be assessed at 24, 48, and [ADDRESS_539347]. Once a score of 9 is reached, no further 
discharge  readiness assessments  are required

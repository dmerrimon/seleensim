3 BACKGROUND / RATIONALE 
3.1 SARS -CoV-2 Testing in the [LOCATION_002]  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the [LOCATION_002] suggests laboratory testing 
to identify the SARS- CoV-2 virus that causes COVID -19. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
given Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for select Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panels that detect 
RNA  specific  to SARS- CoV-2. This study  will use the Exact  Sciences  Laboratories  (ESL) SARS- CoV-2 (N 
gene detection) Test       ,   
The ESL SARS- CoV-2 (N gene detection) Test provides a qualitative result based on detection of RNA. 
The test measures the presence of two regions of the RNA related to the SARS -CoV-2 nucleocapsid 
protein N gene (N1 and N2), which  are specific  for this virus. Both N1 and N2 RNA  must  be detected for a 
positive result and are indicative of active infection by [CONTACT_84096]. A positive result does not rule out other infections. Detection of only one of the two viral RNAs results in an Inconclusive test. Negative results  
(Not detected) do not rule out infection and should be used in combination with clinical and epi[INVESTIGATOR_477454]. The  ESL SARS-CoV-2  (N gene detection) 
Test also measures RNA related to ribonuclease P, which is a human protein and acts as an internal 
reference. The absence of the viral and human RNA would lead to an invalid test result.

While the CDC provides guidelines for the collection of a wide range of upper and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_477455], the ESL SARS-CoV -2 (N gene detection) Test is for use with upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (nasal swab) 
samples  from subjects  receiving  a clinically  indicated COVID-[ADDRESS_612341].[1]  The use of the nasal  swab that 
meets CDC recommendations has advantages, including avoiding the supply issues for specialized sample collection devices, such as the nasopharyngeal swab. Sample collection is also easier with a nasal swab. While the supply shortages could be transient, the collection methods of washes and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_477456].[2]

Emphasis has been placed on increasing overall testing availability, and the access to at home SARS - 
CoV-2 specimen collection (without healthcare worker supervision) will significantly improve the 
effectiveness  of public  health tools  in preventing  spread  of the disease during this pandemic  in the United 
State s. 
3.[ADDRESS_612342] Specimen Collection  Materials  
The SARS- CoV-2 Specimen Collection Materials (Section 6 ) allow for self -collection of a nasal swab 
specimen  and return to a testing  laboratory,  which  will enable at home  collection.  The Mate rials include 
Instructions for Use (IFU), which are a straightforward, step-by -step guide. The usability of the IFU is a 
critical  factor  in the success  of at-home testing  and is  the focus of  this clinical  study.  An IFU with  a high 
completion rate that provides samples with sufficient  quality and quantity of specimen for SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_612343], identify problems (e.g., use errors, delays, close calls) that occur while 
following  the IFU, evaluate root causes  of problems,  and develop strategies  to mitigate  those risks going 
forward.

6 STUDY  MATERIALS  
6.1 SARS -CoV-2 Specimen Collection  Materials  
The SARS- CoV-2 Specimen Collection Materials is a single -use convenience kit comprised of a sterile 
individually wrapped nasal swab (polyester tip with plastic handle) and a 2 ml transport tube with 0.9% 
saline transport medium, packaged together in a single container not intended to be unwrapped or unsealed before it is used by [CONTACT_477460], an individual undergoing testing for COVID -19. A biohazard 
bag, absorbent pad, and UN3373- labelled shippi[INVESTIGATOR_477457]. Instructions  for Use (IFU) 
are also provided  (Appendix  2.0). The SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_612346]  Analysis  (FMEA)  approach was used  to determine potential  hazards 
and their associated risks during use of the SARS -CoV-2 Specimen Collection Materials. For each 
activity, the following high -level questions were asked:  
 Do users  correctly collect  nasal  swab  samples?  
 Do users  correctly prepare  samples  for shipment?  
 Do other  aspects  of use of the SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_612347]  the receipt  of 
usable nasal swab samples at ESL? 
 How easy  or difficult  is it to understand and use the IFU  in the SARS- CoV-2 Specimen  Collection 
Materials to perform tasks?  
 
The activities in the workflow described in the IFU were used to determine tasks to be evaluated in this usability  study.  Each  task was then assigned a rating of “critical”  or “essential,”  based on a human factors 
risk assessment done at Exact Sciences. Critical and essential tasks are defined as follows.  
 Critical  tasks  are those  in which  use errors  or failure  to complete would have  a negative clinical 
impact, such as inaccurate or delayed test results.  
o Failure  to successfully complete a critical  task results in  a use error  or performance 
failure. 
 Essential  tasks  represent  behaviors  that are important  to the overall  use of the SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_612348] sample Unusable  sample

8 STUDY  PROCEDURES  
8.1 Overview  
Subjects who provide informed consent will be observed while following the IFU for the SARS -CoV-2 
Specimen Collection Materials in a setting that simulates a large surface area, such as a kitchen or 
bathroom counter or a tabletop. The room will include common items such as hand sanitizer, pens, 
pencils,  paper  towels,  and a wastebasket.  In the event  a sink is not available,  a large bowl labeled “SINK” 
will be provided next to the hand sanitizer. Subjects will also provide feedback on the usability of the IFU  
by [CONTACT_12550] a survey, answer comprehension questions, provide written feedback on the experience, and address questions from the observer about problems during use. The observer will be an employee of Exact Sciences.

8.7 End of Study  
Subjects’ participation will  be considered completed following completion of the survey, forms, and 
potential  interview  with the observer or  at the point  of early  termination as described in Section  7.3. 
8.[ADDRESS_612357]  Sciences  submission Pre-EUA PEUA200414 as well 
as the recent Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp) accelerated EUA for Test Number 139900, 
which included a self -collection validation, [ADDRESS_612358] result (positive, not detected, or inconclusive). The target is 80% as an acceptable rate of success 
given the first -time task completion for minimally trained users.  
9.3 Other  Pre-Specified Analyses 
Other pre -specified analyses include a characterization of subjects’ self -reported ease of use with the 
Specimen Collection  Materials  Instructions for Use  (IFU),  acceptable answers  on general  comprehension 
of the IFU, observer- reported problems associated with following the IFU,    
 and evaluation of root causes of problems associated with user tasks, including but not 
limited to critical tasks. All analyses will be descriptive in nature. Frequency and percentage will be 
calculated for categorical  measures  and mean,  standard deviation,  median,  and interquartile  range will be 
calculated for continuous measures.  
The subject’s self -reported satisfaction and ease of using the IFU will be assessed using the After - 
Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ).[3, 4] The ASQ is a valid and reliable 3- item survey on user satisfaction 
associated with completing  a task.  Item response  options  are on a 7- point  Likert  scale  where 1 = strongly 
agree and 7 = strongly disagree. An overall satisfaction score is calculated as the average of the non- 
missing responses to the items (theoretical range 1 -7 with a lower score indicating higher satisfaction).  
The frequency and percentage of  each response  to all questions will  be presented, along with the mean, 
standard deviation, median,  and interquartile range of the overall score. In addition, the frequency and 
percentage of subjects with an overall score of 1 to 3 (indicating that the subject agrees to strongly agrees  that they are satisfied)  will be presented.  An average of 3.[ADDRESS_612359]  on questions around 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_477458].  
The frequency  and percentage of individual  problems  observed  (by [CONTACT_477468])  with the 
Specimen Collection  Materials  IFU will be presented,  along with the distribution of total number of 
problems overall and total number of problems on critical tasks ( Section 6.2 ). 
              
                
A qualitative evaluation of results from the user reported data, external observer feedback on user 
interactions,  and laboratory  testing  will be conducted  to assess the root cause  of problems  and evaluate 
mitigating solutions, e.g., whether specific parts of the IFU should be modified.

This study  is expected  to run through its conclusion without  premature termination.  
9.6 Bias  Considerations  
Subjects  who participate in this  study  may not be wholly  representative of those who would use a home 
collection kit for SARS- Cov-2 testing. Subjects with a range of education levels and ages but without 
medical, laboratory, or self-collection experience will be recruited. There are no other known bias 
considerations in this study design.  
9.7 Handling  of Missing  Data 
Missing  data will not be imputed.  
Per the published scoring  guidelines  for the ASQ,  the overall  score  is calculated by [CONTACT_477469]- missing items.  
All analyses  will be described in the study  Statistical  Analysis  Plan,  which  will supersede the methodology 
presented in the Study  Protocol.  Any deviations  in the Statistical  Analysis  Plan will be recorded along with 
their rationale in the final study report, as appropriate.  
10 ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
10.1 Definition  of Adverse Events  
An adverse event  (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended sign,  symptom,  or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of an investigational product or protocol -imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. All 
observed or volunteered adverse events  regardless  of suspected  causal  relationship to the investigational 
product(s) will be reported as described in the following sections.  
Potential side effects from routine nasal swabbing, including, but not limited to, acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] 
(nosebleed),  sneezing,  nasal  redness,  are not required to be reported  to the Sponsor  as adverse  events.  
10.2 Reporting  Period  
Adverse events collection begins at enrollment and ends after completion of the sample collection. 
Adverse events will only be recorded for events that occur during or are believed to be associated with 
the nasal  swab  sample  collection procedures.  All AEs will be reported on the adverse event  page(s)  of the 
CRF.

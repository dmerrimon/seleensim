To Be Completed Only If Protocol is to Receive Expedited Review
Applicability
A. Research activities that (1) present no more than *minimal risk to human subjects, and (2) involve only procedures listed in one or
more of the following categories, may be reviewed by [CONTACT_437000] [ADDRESS_553629] apply regardless of the age of subjects, except as noted.
C. The expedited review procedure may not be used where identification of the subjects and/or their responses would reasonably
place them at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects’ financial standing, employability, insurability, reputation,
or be stigmatizing, unless reasonable and appropriate protections will be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and
breach of confidentiality are no greater than minimal.
D. The expedited review procedure may not be used for classified research involving human subjects.
E. IRBs are reminded that the standard requirements for informed consent (or its waiver, alteration, or exception) apply regardless of
the type of review—expedited or convened—utilized by [CONTACT_1201].
*“Minimal risk” means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in
and of themselves from those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological
examination or tests.
Check the appropriate categories that apply to your research project:
 Study was originally approved by [CONTACT_86412] a convened meeting.
1) Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when condition (a) or (b) is met.
A. Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application is not required. (Note: Research on marketed drugs
that significantly increases the risks or decreases the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is
not eligible for expedited review.)
B. Research on medical devices for which (i) an investigational device exemption application is not required *; or (ii) the
medical device is cleared/approved for marketing and the medical device is being used in accordance with its
cleared/approved labeling. **
* Study must meet one of the IDE Exempt categories listed on the Device Form Attachment. 
** An approved Device used in research according to its approved labeling is considered Exempt from IDE requirements. 
NOTE: Select Category 1 for compassionate use medical device applications or individual patient expanded access
investigational drug applications for which FDA has waived the requirement for full review.
2) Collection of blood samples by [CONTACT_25877], heel stick, ear stick, or venipuncture as follows:
A. From healthy, nonpregnant adults who weigh at least 110 pounds. For these subjects, the amounts drawn may not
exceed 550 ml in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more frequently than 2 times per week; or
B. From other adults and children* considering the age, weight, and health of the subjects, the collection procedure, the
amount of blood to be collected, and the frequency with which it will be collected. For these subjects, the amount drawn
may not exceed the lesser of 50 ml or 3 ml per kg in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more frequently than
2 times per week.
NOTE: Intravenous (IV), Port, Central, or any other lines are NOT eligible under this category even if the research involves
“minimal risk”.
*In Kentucky, “child/children” refers to all individuals less than 18 years of age unless the individual(s) is/are legally
emancipated. (See Informed Consent SOP  for discussion of “Emancipated Individuals” under Kentucky state law.)
Individuals less than 18 years of age who are not emancipated meet the federal definition for “child” (e.g., DHHS, FDA, and
U.S. Department of Education). Children are defined in the HHS regulations as “persons who have not attained the legal age
for consent to treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the
research will be conducted.” If conducting research outside the state of Kentucky, you are responsible for complying with
applicable state law.
3) Prospective collection of biological specimens for research purposes by [CONTACT_25878]. Examples:
Section 2 Page 1 of 261291
CLOSED
A. Hair and nail clippi[INVESTIGATOR_59787] a nondisfiguring manner;
B. Deciduous teeth at time of exfoliation or if routine patient care indicates a need for extraction;
C. Permanent teeth if routine patient care indicates a need for extraction;
D. Excreta and external secretions (including sweat);
E. Uncannulated saliva collected either in an unstimulated fashion or stimulated by [CONTACT_86413]
a dilute citric solution to the tongue;
F. placenta removed at delivery;
G. Amniotic fluid obtained at the time of rupture of the membrane prior to or during labor;
H. Supra- and subgingival dental plaque and calculus, provided the collection procedure is not more invasive than routine
prophylactic scaling of the teeth and the process is accomplished in accordance with accepted prophylactic techniques;
I. Mucosal and skin cells collected by [CONTACT_59846][INVESTIGATOR_59788], skin swab, or mouth washings;
J. Sputum collected after saline mist nebulization.
4) Collection of data through noninvasive procedures (not involving general anesthesia or sedation) routinely employed in
clinical practice, excluding procedures involving x-rays or microwaves. Where medical devices are employed, they must be
cleared/approved for marketing. (Studies intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the medical device are not
generally eligible for expedited review, including studies of cleared medical devices for new indications.) Examples:
A. Physical sensors that are applied either to the surface of the body or at a distance and do not involve input of significant
amounts of energy into the subject or an invasion of the subject’s privacy;
B. Weighing or testing sensory acuity;
C. Magnetic resonance imaging;
D. electrocardiography, electroencephalography, thermography, detection of naturally occurring radioactivity,
electroretinography, ultrasound, diagnostic infrared imaging, doppler blood flow, and echocardiography;
E. moderate exercise, muscular strength testing, body composition assessment, and flexibility testing where appropriate
given the age, weight, and health of the individual.
5) Research involving materials (data, documents, records, or specimens) that have been or will be collected solely for non-
research purposes (such as medical treatment or diagnosis) as well as research involving existing information or specimens that
were previously collected for research purposes, provided they were not collected for the currently proposed research. (Note:
Some research in this category may be exempt from the HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects. This listing refers
only to research that is not exempt.)
6) Collection of data from voice, video, digital, or image recordings made for research purposes.
7) Research on individual or group characteristics or behavior (including, but not limited to, research on perception, cognition,
motivation, identity, language, communication, cultural beliefs or practices, and social behavior) or research employing survey,
interview, oral history, focus group, program evaluation, human factors evaluation, or quality assurance methodologies. (Note:
Some research in this category may be exempt from the HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects. This listing refers
only to research that is not exempt.)

Request for Waiver of Informed Consent Process
If you are requesting IRB approval to waive the requirement for the informed consent process, or to alter some or all of the
elements of informed consent, complete, Section 1 and Section 2 below.
Note: The IRB does not approve waiver or alteration of the consent process for greater than minimal risk research, except
for planned emergency/acute care research as provided under FDA regulations. Contact [CONTACT_41897] ([PHONE_728]).
Section 7 Page 1 of 461291
CLOSED
SECTION 1.
Check the appropriate item:
I am requesting waiver of the requirement for the informed consent process.
I am requesting alteration of the informed consent process.
If you checked the box for this item, describe which elements of consent will be altered and/or omitted, and justify the
alteration.
SECTION 2.
Explain how each condition applies to your research.
a) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subject.
This research involves no more than minimal
risk to participants, as the interactions with
participants will be conducted remotely and will
not pertain to highly sensitive content, the
interventions are non-invasive with little to no
risk of harm or serious adverse events and are
aimed to promote relaxation and comfort.
b) The rights and welfare of subjects will not be adversely affected.
The rights and welfare of subjects will not be
adversely affected as this request is for
recruitment purpose to access medical records
and all information will be protected following
HIPAA guidelines.
c) The research could not practicably be carried out without the requested waiver or alteration.
We would be unable to sufficiently recruit
participants without access to medical records
prior to recruitment.
d) Whenever possible, the subjects or legally authorized representatives will be provided with additional pertinent
information after they have participated in the study.
The subjects and LAR's will be informed and
consented prior to enrollment of study, but their
medical records will be accessed prior to
consent.
e) If the research involves using or accessing identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the research
could not practicably be carried out without using such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format.
Private information/specimens are “identifiable” if the investigator may ascertain the identity of the subject or if
identifiers are associated with the information (e.g., medical records). This could be any of the 18 HIPAA identifiers
including dates of service .
If not using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, insert N/A below.
Identifiable private information will be used and
accessed prior to informed consent. All
information will be protected in accordance to
HIPAA rules and regulations. We would be
unable to recruit for this study without access to
medical records and identifiable private
information.
Section [ADDRESS_553634] fit into one of three regulatory options :
1. The only record linking the participant and the research would be the consent document, and the principal risk would be
potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality (e.g., a study that involves participants who use illegal drugs).
2. The research presents no more than minimal risk to the participant and involves no procedures for which written consent
is normally required outside of the research context (e.g., a cover letter on a survey, or a phone script).
3. The participant (or legally authorized representative) is a member of a distinct cultural group or community in which
signing forms is not the norm, the research presents no more than minimal risk to the subject, and there is an appropriate
alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.
Select the option below that best fits your study. 
If the IRB approves a waiver of signatures, participants must still be provided oral or written information about the study.
To ensure you include required elements in your consent document, use the Cover Letter Template  as a guide. There is
an English  and a Spanish  version.
 
Option 1
Describe how your study meets these criteria:
a) The only record linking the participant and the research would be the consent document:
b) The principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality (i.e., a study that involves
subjects who use illegal drugs).
Under this option, each participant (or legally authorized representative) must be asked whether (s)he wants to sign a
consent document; if the participant agrees to sign a consent document, only an IRB approved version should be
used.
Option 2
Describe how your study meets these criteria:
a) The research presents no more than minimal risk to the participant:
Addition of the SAAF online survey does not
alter or increase the risk to the participants.
b) Involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context (i.e. a cover
letter on a survey, or a phone script):
Informed consent regarding continued contact
[CONTACT_437001].
Addition of the SAAF will be accompanied with
a cover letter and completion of the
assessment will indicate implied consent.
Option 3
Describe how your study meets these criteria:
a) The subject (or legally authorized representative) is a member of a distinct cultural group or community in which
signing forms is not the norm.
b) The research presents no more than minimal risk to the subject.
c) There is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.

Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) face numerous changes throughout the course of cognitive
decline. Behaviors and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are reported in over 80% of those diagnosed with ADRD and
contribute to increased mortality.1-[ADDRESS_553639]-line intervention for BPSD.

Maladaptive behaviors and BPSD can sometimes be attributed to environmental incongruence with the individuals’ sensory needs, as
defined in environmental press theory24,25. Our environment is perceived through our senses. Additional physiological changes
associated to aging such as sensory receptor changes and the onset of apathy in dementia6 can lead to internal causes of sensory
deprivation26,27. Under-stimulating environments can lead to external sensory deprivation28,29 possibly causing boredom, whereby

This study will use a single-blind, placebo controlled, three-arm, parallel-design. Thirty subjects with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s
disease as primary dementia type (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score of 2-3) will be randomly assigned to one of three arms:
standard care; standard protocol (pre-determined set of environmental design modifications); or personalized protocol
(environmental design modification developed with subject based on sensory preference and behavioral needs). Intervention will last
[ADDRESS_553642] will be conducted over 10 weeks of participant engagement. 
With recent in-person limitations to due COVID-19, as well as the need for increased evidence involving telemedicine, this study will
be conducted in accordance with the University of Kentucky Telemedicine regulations and practices. The University of Kentucky has
had an active telehealth program since 1995 and has conducted hundreds of thousands of telehealth encounters using interactive
videoconference technology in over 25 medical, surgical, mental/behavioral health and therapeutic specialties. [LOCATION_006]’s videoconference
platform is Zoom. [LOCATION_006] has a Business Associate Agreement with Zoom, and uses the HIPAA compliant version of the technology to
insure patient confidentiality is maintained. Telehealth has proven to be a successful modality for clinical encounters for many years,
but the COVID [ADDRESS_553643]-to-consumer telehealth service that uses the patient’s personal device (home
computer, tablet or smartphone) is being used by [CONTACT_46431] 15,000 patients/month.
Participants will be selected with assistance from Sanders Brown Center on Aging (SBCoA) staff using the University of Kentucky
Alzheimer’s Center Longitudinal participant database (IRB# 88-0102-F2L [Jicha, PI]). University of Kentucky Alzheimer’s Disease
Center Clinical Core Leader, [CONTACT_290584] A. Jicha, has approved access to and use of the University of Kentucky Alzheimer’s
Disease Center Community Registry database, which is located at the SBCoA Clinic, [ADDRESS_553644]. Rhodus (PI) to follow up with contact [CONTACT_437004]/or the study flyer will be mailed or emailed to eligible
patients with request to contact [CONTACT_437005]. 
Primary measures: 
Feasibility will be assessed by [CONTACT_437006]. 
• Caregivers will be responsible for providing treatment protocols throughout duration of treatment window. Adherence to the protocol
will be kept and measured using the behavioral journal and intervention adherence log 
• Weekly check-ins with the caregivers will provide opportunity to review adherence and reactions to the protocol, as well as assess
for adverse reactions, need for modification, or discontinuation. If the investigator finds that the participant is noncompliant, the PI
[CONTACT_8985] 9 Page 2 of 1661291

may remove the participant from further participation in the study. 
• Caregiver burden will be measured using the Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale. 
Secondary measures:
• Behavior will be assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) at
baseline and post-intervention, and behavior tracking throughout intervention. 
• Cognitive measures will include the MOCA and CDR at baseline, post-intervention and follow up
• Heart rate tracking and sleep will be measured using wearable activity tracker (Actigraph) at all times except while charging device. 
Sensory processing patterns and functional activity engagement will be assessed for all participants with dementia and used for
individualization arm of intervention. 
• Sensory processing will be measured using the Adult Sensory Profile (ASP) for all subjects at baseline. 
• Functional activity engagement will be measured using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) at baseline and
post-intervention. 
Control Group: Standard of care for behavioral management and 2-page educational pamphlet describing safety for home
environments. At the conclusion of the study, following the four-week follow up visit, participants will be offered a standardized
sensory kit (as described below) to use at their discretion.
Standard Environmental Design Protocol: Participants’ caregivers will receive standard recommendations for physical environmental
modifications, caregiving techniques, and a sensorimotor stimulation kit via mailing from study site. Physical environmental
modifications will include declutter living space, reduce background noise, increase natural light, accommodate for accessibility to
commode and areas for drinking and eating. Caregiving techniques will include training for calming demeanor (emotional contagion),
needs-driven care to decrease onset of behavioral disruption, and accepting and accommodating approach to behavioral disruption.
A sensorimotor stimulation kit will be provided to each participants’ caregiver for administration three times per day, lasting 30-60
minutes total per day. The stimulation kit will include an item for tactile tool via hands and arms, auditory input via a CD or audio file for
music and speakers, olfactory input will be gained through use of scented oils on cotton balls, proprioceptive input will be provided
with a 3 pound lap pad, vestibular input will be provided through written instruction of movement (walking, dancing, arm movements if
unable to walk unassisted), and visual input via fiberoptic lights and a handheld liquid gel timer. 
Individualized Environmental Design Protocol: Participants’ caregivers will receive standard recommendations of physical
environment modifications and caregiving techniques. Physical environmental modifications will include declutter living space, reduce
background noise, increase natural light, accommodate for accessibility to commode and areas for drinking and eating. Caregiving
techniques will include training for calming demeanor (emotional contagion), needs-driven care to decrease onset of behavioral
disruption, and accepting and accommodating approach to behavioral disruption. Individualized sensory stimulation kids will be
developed using subjects’ preferred sensory stimuli (as determined by [CONTACT_437007]) and behavioral
concerns identified in the COPM. One target behavior and/or time period of the day will be targeted for improvement. Selection of
items included in the individualized sensory kit will be determined based on the attached decision tree and sensory mode plans. The
sensory kit will be provided via caregiver administration or supervision two scheduled times (once in the morning and once in the
afternoon) per day and one time as needed prior to activity or task associated with behavior concern to promote maintained
behavioral regulation and adaptive responses. 
Data Analysis: Due to the nature of feasibility of this study, sample size of 30 participants with cognitive impairment (10 per arm) does
not fully power the study. Statistical description of behavior change results will be explorative and descriptive in nature. Per-protocol
analysis (PPA) will be performed with 75% or more adherence to program as determined from weekly visits and journals. Power
analyses for secondary outcome measures cannot be performed as this study is a preliminary investigation of these secondary
outcome measures.
Summary statistics will be tabulated for the behavior change, protocol adherence, and adverse events. The frequencies of behavior
change, protocol adherence, and adverse events will be compared between participants within same group and between group for
differences. 
Summary statistics will be tabulated by [CONTACT_437008], week 4, and week [ADDRESS_553645] of care group by [CONTACT_6484]
(ANOVA). If they are not normal, then consideration will be given to data transformation.

Study Population:  Describe the characteristics of the subject population, such as anticipated number, age range, gender, ethnic
background and health status. Identify the criteria for inclusion and exclusion. Explain the rationale for the use of special classes such
as fetuses, pregnant women, children, institutionalized, adults with impaired consent capacity, prisoners, economically or educationally
disadvantaged persons or others who are likely to be vulnerable.
If women or minorities are included, please address how the inclusion of women and members of minority groups and their
subpopulations will help you meet your scientific objectives. Exclusion of women or minorities requires clear and compelling rationale
that shows inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or that inclusion is inappropriate for the purpose of the
study. Cost is not an acceptable reason for exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from other sources. Women of
childbearing potential should not be excluded routinely from participation in clinical research.

PHI and identifying information will be sought from SBCoA participant charts. PHI accessed will include: Name, DOB, email address,
phone number, address, medical history, diagnoses, medications, tests completed, and/or visit notes at Sanders-Brown Center on
Aging or the Kentucky Neuroscience Institute. 
Given the nature of cognitive impairment associated dementia (see Form T), upmost precaution and protection will be included in the
informed consent process. The intent of this study is to conduct research with severely cognitively impaired participant whom may
also have communication deficits. Participants have associated dependency on caregivers/LAR for decision making, safety, and
activities and/or instrumental activities of daily living. Explanation of the study objectives, informed consent process and confidentiality
will be explained to the individuals with cognitive impairment and their caregiver/LAR. If the dyad is willing to participate, informed
consent will be sought by:
[CONTACT_437017]-screening, it will be determined if the patient has a legally authorized representative/advocate. If so, the consent will be
sent to and signed by [CONTACT_437018] (LAR) and assent will be obtained from the patient. If the patient does not have legally authorized
representative and appears oriented (to time, place, person) and is able to verbalize understanding of the study expectations and
risks, informed consent will be signed by [CONTACT_437019]. 
Informed consent will be collected via several ways. The electronic or hard copy IRB-Stamped informed consents will be
emailed/mailed to the person with dementia's legally authorized representative (LAR) or the patient with dementia and their care
advocate if LAR is not established (patient consent form), and their identified caregiver (caregiver consent form). An electronic form
e-Consent will be emailed to both individuals (LAR and Caregiver) and required for signature [CONTACT_437060]. This form
will be signed prior to the screening visit, or after thorough review during the screening visit, along with assent obtained from the
person with dementia. The assent form will be discussed and used with the patient via Zoom video conferencing during screening
visit. Verbal confirmation of understanding and willingness to participant will be sought. If they are unable to provide verbal
communication, non-verbal cues such as head nodding (described in Form T) will be collected. If non-verbal cues are unable to be
collected, consent will be deferred entirely to the LAR. 
A copy of the consent form will be emailed or mailed to the participants prior to Visit 1. LAR’s, participants with dementia, and
caregivers will be advised that participation is strictly voluntary, and they can withdraw from the study at any time. Participants will be
assured that participation or nonparticipation of this study will have no direct effect on enrollment or participation of SBCoA program
and healthcare services.
A waiver of documentation of informed consent will be used for administration of the Situational Assessment of Activity and Function
(SAAF) survey. A link will be emailed to caregiver participants with a cover letter explaining the assessment. Participants are not
required or obligated to respond to the email or survey and all responses will be deidentified. Completion of the assessment and
feedback via email to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_436980]' experience with the assessment will indicate implied consent.

Research Procedures:  Describe the research procedures that will be followed. Identify all procedures that will be carried out with
each group of subjects. Differentiate between procedures that involve standard/routine clinical care and those that will be performed
specifically for this research project.
For this study, the following step-by-step sequence will be used. Recruitment will occur via discussion with SBCOA medical team
(MD/APRN/PA) and [CONTACT_437066] of appropriate referrals of heightened cognitive impairment with behavioral disturbance.
Additionally, SBCOA records will be reviewed for all eligible cohort participants. These participants will be contact[CONTACT_437020], mailing, and/or emailing eligible participants with an invitation to participate in the current study. Following
agreement to participate, SBCoA staff and researcher will coordinate with the participant a date and time for Visit [ADDRESS_553648] recent vital signs
(systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]), known allergens, chronic medical conditions, recent
medical changes, and medications. The PI (OT) or [LOCATION_006]ADC medical staff (MD/APRN/PA) will conduct a physical and neurological
examine via Telemedicine.The physical examination will include skin, head/ears/eyes/nose/throat (HEENT), oral/teeth/gums (history of
dental problems/dentures), sensory function, gait/walking ability, and musculoskeletal range of motion of upper extremities. All
complete physical and neurological examination data will be entered on the appropriate CRF. Neurological assessment will include of
cranial nerves, strength, coordination, symmetry of movements, and movement speed. Verbal assessment of patients’ sensory
function (including hypersensitivity) with caregiver will occur at the screening. Significant abnormalities consistent with disease
processes will be documented. 
Once eligibility is confirmed, the research assistant will email a REDCap link to the caregiver for the Zarit Caregiver Burden and the
Adult Sensory Profile, Actigraph and charger, and a copy of consent forms to the participant’s caregiver. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_436981] 1, and provide caregiver and participant with Actigraph wear and care instructions. The VABS will be emailed to the
caregiver via a confidential link through Pearson Publishing. 
Subjects will be randomized to treatment arms by [CONTACT_202559]. Participants will be randomized into one of the three groups:
control, standard environmental design protocol, individualized environmental design protocol. Recruitment will be ongoing until all
groups have 10 participants. In the event of drop out or early termination (causes will be recorded), researchers will recruit for
replacement participants so that the study is completed with [ADDRESS_553649]
adverse events, concurrent medication, Actigraph, and weekly behavior journals/compliance. The research assistant will conduct the
NPI, COPM, VABS with the caregiver and the MOCA with the person with dementia. A member of the SBCoA medical team will
conduct a physical and neurological exam. Due to the length of assessments within Visit 7, this session may be split and completed
in more than one Zoom conference. The Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale will be emailed or mailed to the caregiver with prepaid envelop
for return.
A four-week follow up will be conducted at Visit [ADDRESS_553650] of potential items sent in sensory kit is attached here.

The data collection instrument(s) can be submitted with your application in draft form with the understanding that the final copy will be
submitted to the IRB for approval prior to use (submit final version to the IRB for review as a modification request if initial IRB approval
was issued while the data collection instrument was in draft form).
Note: The IRB approval process does not include a statistical review. Investigators are strongly encouraged to develop data
management and analysis plans in consult with a statistician.
Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
The NPI-Q will be administered with the caregiver at baseline, week 4, and week 8. The NPI-Q is a commonly used behavior
assessment tool for persons with cognitive impairment.[63] This tool was selected in order to best represent behaviors characteristic
of cognitive impairment. The assessment includes 12 behavioral and psychiatric domains including delusions, hallucinations,
irritability, anxiety, agitation, depressions, dysphoria, apathy, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, appetite/eating changes, and night-
time behaviors. The care provider rates these behaviors based on severity of the impact on the patient on a scale of 1 (mild), 2
(moderate), or 3 (severe). The care provider also rates distress to themselves caused by [CONTACT_437021] a scale from 0 (not
distressing at all) to 5 (extreme or very distressing). Both behavior severity and caregiver distress will be used in analysis. 
Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS)
The VABS will be used to assess behavior at baseline, week 4, week 8. The VABS is a standardized, norm-referenced assessment
of adaptive behavior for individuals from birth to age of 90 years. Domains of communication, daily living skills, socialization, motor
skills, and maladaptive behavior are examined. The assessment is designed for a variety of developmental, intellectual, and cognitive
disabilities, including autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders. This
assessment has an option specific for telehealth, remote administration. For this study, change in the Adaptive Behavior Composite
(ABC) score, as well as domain specific scores of communication, daily living skills, socialization, and motor skills will be used in
analysis. 
Adult Sensory Profile (ASP)
In order to maximize time consideration, the ASP will be mailed to caregivers following screening with a prepaid return envelope. The
ASP is a validated instrument and will yield norm referenced (for age) data regarding sensory processing abilities and will be used in
development of individualized protocols, as is typi[INVESTIGATOR_436982].[35, 64, 65] The ASP is a 60-item
survey and is completed by [CONTACT_437022]. For this study, care partners will complete the survey. Each item
describes a behavior attributed to sensory processing. The behaviors belong to one of four sensory processing patterns (15 items
each): low registration, sensation seeking, sensory sensitivity, and sensation avoiding. Participants rate the frequency with which they
engage in each behavior or they observe it in the participant, in the case of caregivers responding. The ratings for all items are
summed within each sensory processing pattern to obtain summary scores. The summary score of each category is compared to
normative data and classified as being ‘much less’, ‘less’, ‘similar’, ‘more than’ or ‘much more’ than most people in their age range. 
Behavioral Journal
Behavior journals will be kept by [CONTACT_437023] 4-week intervention. Behavior journals will be used to measure adherence
to the treatment protocol using a daily tracking log, prompt care partner reflection of each week’s intervention use, and monitor
behavioral changes throughout the intervention. Journals will be reviewed weekly with study personnel and returned to investigator at
intervention completion on week [ADDRESS_553651] behavioral and physiological data of sleep, movement, and physical activity. The
device will be worn during baseline (1 week), first week of treatment (1 week), and last week of treatment (1 week). The device will be
mailed back to [LOCATION_006]ADC during treatment window for charging and data collection, and mailed to patient prior to last week of treatment.
The device will be returned to [LOCATION_006]ADC via prepaid postage following last week of intervention. The data will be collected off of the
device following completion of the 4-week intervention window and stored in ActiLife 6, a private and secure platform for data

Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 
The MoCA is a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. The MoCA assesses different cognitive domains: attention
and concentration, memory, language, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Time to administer the MoCA is
approximately 5-10 minutes. The total possible score is 30 points; a score of [ADDRESS_553652] (Clinical Dementia Rating)
The CDR will be administered to the participant and informant, at screening, week [ADDRESS_553653] is a structured interview protocol that assesses a patient's cognitive and functional performance in six

these are combined to obtain a composite score ranging from [ADDRESS_553654] can discern very mild impairments, based on
informant interview and short task-based participant responses.
Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)
COPM is a client-centered, standardized, criterion-referenced outcome measure which allows for individualized treatment
implementation. The COPM is administered via a semi-structured interview with caregivers at baseline, Week 4, and 8 week follow
up. The COPM is a multidisciplinary health assessment that assesses all areas of the participants’ occupational performance,
including self-care, leisure, and instrumental activities of daily living. Caregivers identify areas of concern or that need improvement,
and the top five activities are rated for performance and satisfaction. Caregiver rating of performance and satisfaction of self-
identified activities will be used in statistical analysis.

Situational Assessment of Activity and Function (SAAF) 
The SAAF is a new assessment created by [CONTACT_437024] (Rhodus) to gain better insights on the situational characteristics that
cause behavioral reactions in persons with dementia. The SAAF was developed from initial data collection of the current study. The
SAAF is 120 questions to be completed by [CONTACT_437025] 15 minutes to
complete. Questions are review caregiver perceptions of the activity performance of the person they care for in various activities (i.e.,
cooking, dressing, community mobility, etc.) The assessment is completed electronically using Redcap survey emailed to caregivers.
Use of the SAAF is in this study is to glean initial reactions from caregiver participants regarding their ease of use and to determine
time length of administration. The use of the SAAF in this study will be completed using REDCap public survey link. This feature
allows individuals to complete the survey, but does not associate a record ID to answers, all responses are anonymous. Data from
survey item responses will not be stored, saved, reviewed or analyzed. Caregivers currently enrolled in this study will be asked to
voluntarily complete the electronic survey if they would like. It is not required. Participants will be asked to disclose the length of time it
took to complete the form and to document any initial perceptions of the ease of use of the form and/or it's perceived applicability.

Safety Precautions:  Describe the procedures for protecting against or minimizing any potential risks,  including risks of breach of
confidentiality or invasion of privacy . Where appropriate, discuss provisions for ensuring necessary medical or professional
intervention in the event of adverse events, or unanticipated problems involving subjects. Also, where appropriate, describe the
provisions for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. If vulnerable populations other than adults with impaired
consent capacity are to be recruited, describe additional safeguards for protecting the subjects’ rights and welfare.
The procedures for protecting against and minimizing any potential risks of breach of confidentiality or invasion of privacy during the
research will require each individual with dementia, their LAR, and the caregiver to review and sign the consent and confidentiality
agreements. All study conduct will occur using procedures outlined and validated by [CONTACT_437029].
Contact [CONTACT_38429]. Greg Jicha (SBCOA Clinical director) and SBCOA social workers will be kept on file and accessible during
data collection in the field in case issues or concerns arise during intervention visits. Collected data will be de-identified and all data
will be kept in a password-protected computer for a period of six years, then destroyed via deletion of files.
Benefit vs. Risk: Describe potential benefits to the subject(s); include potential benefits to society and/or general knowledge to be
gained. Describe why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefit(s) to subjects and in relation to the
importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. If you are using vulnerable subjects (e.g., impaired consent
capacity, pregnant women, etc…), justify their inclusion by [CONTACT_222759]’ vulnerability and the risks to them.  For information about inclusion of certain vulnerable populations, see the IRB/ORI
Standard Operating Procedure for Protection of Vulnerable Subjects [C3.0100] [ PDF].

describe your NIH data sharing plan.
Management after study:  Describe how the collected data/specimens will be managed after the end of the study. Specify
whether identifiers will be removed from the maintained information/material. If identifiers will not be removed, provide
justification for retaining them and specify what steps will be taken to secure the data/specimens (e.g., maintaining a coded
list of identifiers separate from the data/specimens).
If the data/specimens will be destroyed, describe how, when, and why this will be done. Note that destruction of primary data
may violate NIH and NSF retention and sharing requirements, journal publication guidance, and University Data-Retention
policies . Additionally, primary data may be necessary for other purposes (to validate reproducibility, for data sharing, or for
evidence in various investigations). PIs should carefully consider whether the destruction of data is justified.
The investigator is responsible for retaining signed consent and assent documents and IRB research records for at least six
years after study closure, as outlined in the Study Closure SOP [ PDF]. If the research falls under the authority of the FDA or
other regulatory agencies, or a study sponsor is involved, additional requirements may apply.

DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
The Principle Investigator (PI, Rhodus) and Faculty Advisor (Greg Jicha, MD, PhD) will be responsible for monitoring the data and
safety of participants along with their co-investigators.
a. Periodic Review: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_436987]-weekly meetings for the first two months of enrollment, then monthly for
four more months, and quarterly thereafter. The faculty advisor will review all minor AE and SAE reported to date of review. The staff
meetings will include the PI, co-investigators, and lay co-workers in charge of assessment. The meetings will include evaluation of all
research procedures, fidelity to protocol, discussion of newly enrolled participants, and review of status of all formally enrolled
participants including all adverse events. Adverse events will be reviewed to determine if changes in the protocol are indicated.
Participant demographics to date, recruitment progress, difficulties encountered during enrollment, an update on data entry, and any
other issues or concerns that have arisen since the last research team meeting will also be discussed. 
In addition to review of all research procedures and AE/SAE, specific review of risk related to behavioral condition of the patient and
related to the intervention will be completed at meetings. Review will assess: 
1. Risk to behavioral condition: Weekly checks via Zoom video conferencing of behavioral tracking will occur with PI [INVESTIGATOR_436988].
If substantial behavioral change is noted by [CONTACT_437033], this behavior change will be reviewed with faculty advisor. 
2. Risk of Intervention: Weekly checks via Zoom video conferencing with participants will assess adverse events and patient
complaint related to the intervention tools. We anticipate the following potential areas of concern:
a. Lotions-minor dermatological reaction 
b. Exercise cards-muscle soreness, fall during exercise 
c. Snacks-possible choking hazard
d. Actigraph wear-skin irritation at wear site (wrist)
e. Scents of lotion-headache
f. Gel lap pad-strain from lifting 3 pound lap pad. 
b. Adverse Events: In compliance with Federal Regulation 21CFR §56.108(b)(1) and 45 CFR 46.103(b)(5), any unanticipated
problems, including adverse events that are unexpected and related to the study, will be promptly reported to the University
Institutional Review Board (IRB). Events judged as “unexpected” are those not specified in the IRB-approved research protocol or
informed consent document. 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for the proposed project incorporates the policies on human subject data and safety monitoring
specified by [CONTACT_222763].
Risk Assessment: Minimal risk. The study procedures and intervention represents minimal risk to study participants as this study
intervention is a combined environment-based educational/sensory stimulation and standard-of-care intervention to improve
neuropsychiatric behaviors in people with dementia. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_436989] (intensity) of reported AEs according to the NCI CTC. If a participant experiences
an event not detailed by [CONTACT_437034], the following guidelines will be used to analyze severity: 
• Mild: symptoms or signs exist and may require treatment, but are transient and easily tolerated. 
• Moderate: treatment is required and continued monitoring of event is prescribed to avert participant discomfort. 
• Severe: event requires treatment and continued monitoring is prescribed to prevent incapacitating or life threatening effects to the
participant's health. 
• Life threatening: when the participant is, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurs, or if
the event requires immediate medical treatment and continued monitoring. Note that this definition does not include an event that, had
it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death. 
• Fatal: Death resulted from AE. 
All adverse events occurring during the study observed by [CONTACT_437035] (whether or not attributed to
study procedures or interventions), will be recorded in the subject electronic record. Medically significant adverse events considered
related to the study procedures or interventions by [CONTACT_437036]. It will be left
to the faculty advisor’s clinical judgment whether or not an adverse event is of sufficient severity to require the participant's removal
from treatment. A participant may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable adverse
event. If either of these occur, the participant must undergo a Termination (early discontinuation) visit, and be given appropriate care

under medical supervision until symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable. 
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_436990] 24 hours of
the study site staff becoming aware of the SAE. Adverse events will be coded according to body system using MedDRA. A final
medical review and sign off on all codes by a designated reviewer within the ADCS will ensure accuracy and consistency. 
In this study, we do not anticipate moderate, severe, life-threatening or fatal AEs. 
c. Plans for Safety Review: A methodical review of all procedures will be an integral part of each research team meeting. This review
will include discussion of the protocol to ensure adherence, discussion of procedures to insure confidentiality is maintained and that
data are collected with minimal risk for violations of confidentiality. A meeting involving the PI, faculty advisor, co-investigators, and lay
coworkers will be called if an unexpected adverse event occurs. 
d. Plans for Data Quality: The research design, methods and procedures have been reviewed by [CONTACT_59881],
all of whom have indicated their approval of the processes as delineated and believe that this research project will yield quality data
that will generate new knowledge. Detailed operationalization of this plan will be done as a team to assure data quality.
e. Reporting Mechanisms: Reporting for this study will include an annual report to the University of Kentucky IRB, with appropriate
updates and reports in the event of an adverse event(s). SAEs will be reported to the [LOCATION_006] IRB within 24 hours of notification as
mandated by [CONTACT_437037].
f. Plans for Modification or Termination of Study: If SAE or frequent AE’s beyond mild severity occur in more than 30% of participants,
we will review research intervention causes and modify intervention to minimize risk. We will withdrawal patients with AE’s above
moderate severity if AE is associated with study intervention, as this will indicate risks may exceed potential benefits of this study.

The SAAF is a new assessment created by [CONTACT_437024] (Rhodus)
to gain better insights on the situational characteristics that cause
behavioral reactions in persons with dementia. The SAAF was
developed from initial data collection of the current study. The SAAF is
120 questions to be completed by [CONTACT_437041] 15 minutes to complete.
Questions review caregiver perceptions of the activity performance of
the person they care for in various activities (i.e., cooking, dressing,
community mobility, etc.) The assessment is completed electronically
using Redcap survey emailed to caregivers. Use of the SAAF in this
study is to glean initial reactions from caregiver participants regarding
their ease of use and to determine time length of administration. The
use of the SAAF in this study will be completed using REDCap public
survey link. This feature allows individuals to complete the survey, but

 Consent  and Authorization  to Participate in a Research Study  
 
 
KEY INFORMATION  FOR PATIENT  CONSENT IN:  
ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN FOR BEHAVIORAL REGULATION IN PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA : 
 
We are asking you  to choose whether or not  to volunteer for  a research study about the impact of the 
environment on behaviors of people with dementia. We are asking you because you are living with dementia (or 
are the Legally Authorized Representative, LAR) and may be willing to participate in this study. This page is to 
give you key information to help you decide whether to participate.  We have  included detailed information after 
this page . Ask the research team questions. If you have questions later, the contact [CONTACT_429860].   
WHAT IS THE STUDY ABOUT AND HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?   
By [CONTACT_56761], we hope to learn  if environmental strategies aimed to improve behavior are easily  
implemented by [CONTACT_437042]. The study will 
involve the primary care partner and the person with dementia, referred to in this study as a ‘dyad.’ This study 
will be conducted using a teleheal th approach with phone calls, Zoom video conferencing, and all materials will 
be mailed directly to your home. You will not be required to leave your home for the purposes of this study. Your 
participation in this research will involve one screening visit , three assessment visits , and six weeks of treatment 
implementation including weekly contact [CONTACT_437043][INVESTIGATOR_541]. Your primary care partner will be asked 
to implement approaches to help you feel more relaxed . We anticipate the project lasting ap proximately twelve  
weeks from time of screening visit to the follow up visit.  This will include approximately 9.5 hours of Zoom video 
conferencing and 4 5 hours of at -home intervention throughout the twelve weeks.  For detailed descriptions,  refer 
to the Detailed Consent  and appendix A on page 8 .   
WHAT ARE KEY REASONS YOU MIGHT CHOOSE TO VOLUNTEER FOR THIS STUDY?  
There is no guarantee that you will get any benefit from taking part in this study. Your willingness to  take part, 
however, may, in the future, help doctors better understand and/or treat others who have dementia . For a 
complete description of benefits, refer to the Detailed Consent.  
WHAT ARE KEY REASONS YOU MIGHT CHOOSE NOT TO VOLUNTEER FOR THIS STUDY?  
This study seeks dyads who live in their homes within the community, and who do not live in facilities such as 
nursing homes, personal care homes, or assisted living facilities. A goal of the study is to assess applicability of 
telehealth provision using Zoom video conferencing for assessment, training, and weekly communications. You  
will need to have access to a computer or smart phone which has the capability of running Zoom video 
conferencing. You will be asked by [CONTACT_437044] (i.e., listen to music, use 
lotion, etc.). If you feel as though you are  unable or unwilling to engage in interventions included in this study, 
the dyad  will not be included. For a complete description of risks, refer to the Detailed Co nsent.  You may not 
want to participate if you don’t want to use Zoom video conferencing, or if you do not want to p articipate in  the 
interventions as the patient . 
DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?  
If you decide to take part in the study, it should be because you really want to volunteer. You will not lose any 
services, benefits or rights you would normally have if you choose not to volunteer.  
WHAT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS OR CONCERNS?  
If you have questions, suggestions, or concerns regarding this study or you want to withdraw from the study  
contact [CONTACT_437045] , PhD, OTR/L  (PI) of the University of Kentucky, Sanders -Brown Center on Aging at 
[PHONE_9090] or [EMAIL_8334]

   DETAILED CONSENT  FOR PATIENT  PARTICIPATION : 
ARE THERE REASONS WHY YOU WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR THIS STUDY?  
This study will involve a primary caregiver and a person with dementia  (patient) . If both individuals cannot 
participate in this study, you may not qualify. The study also uses Zoom video conferencing, and so access to a 
camera (suc h as a smartphone, tablet, webcam, etc.) and internet access is required.  
WHERE WILL THE STUDY TAKE PLACE AND WHAT IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME INVOLVED?  
The research procedures will be conducted at your home via Zoom video conferencing with research staff at 
Sanders -Brown Center on Aging. You will not need to come to the center, but weekly times for videoconference 
meeting will be arranged during the study. Reminder calls 24 -48 hours prior to each vi deoconference will be made 
by [CONTACT_437046]. Each of those visits will take a  1-2 hours.  
Additionally, we ask you to participate in daily treatment activities for a 6 -week duration. The total amount of time 
you will be asked to volu nteer for this study is  approximately 9.5 hours of Zoom video conferencing . If the dyad is 
randomized to a treatment group, the patient will engage in 45 hours of at -home intervention throughout the  next 
twelve weeks.  
WHAT WILL YOU BE ASKED TO DO?  
Each pa tient/caregiver dyad will be randomized into one of three groups:  
 -Control group: Will receive standard of care currently received through medical and social services 
outside of this study. A one -page home safety instructional flyer will be provided to t he dyad. All assessments and 
Zoom video time requirements are listed in Appendix A. At the conclusion of th e study, f ollowing the fou r-week 
follow up visit, participants  will be offered a standardi zed sensory kit (as described below ) to use at th eir 
discr etion . 
 -Standardized Environmental Design Protocol Group: Caregivers will receive training for physical and 
social environment setup which may alter interactions and home set up for the patient. Pre -determined sensory 
kits will be mailed to the patient’s home and caregivers will distribute and facilitate use of the tools included on a 
schedule provided to the caregiver . These supplies may promote relaxation, such as a CD player , a CD, scented 
lotion, a blanket, exercise cards, hand -held toys, and snacks (pretzels or mints). All assessments and zoom video 
time requirements are listed in Appendix A.  
 -Individualized Environmental Design Group: Caregivers will receive training for physical and social 
environment setup which may alter interactions and home set up for the patient. After baseline assessments , an 
occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_436996]. Thes e kits will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_436997]’ home, and caregivers will distribute and facilitate 
use of the tools included on a schedule provided to the caregiver. These supplies may promote relaxation, and 
include a CD player, a CD, scented lotion,  a blanket, exercise cards, hand -held toys, and snacks (pretzels or 
mints). All assessments and zoom video time requirements are listed in Appendix A.  
 
The following tasks will be associated with participation in this study and will take place at the patient’s  home  
using Zoom video conferencing. Informed consent will be obtained prior to the following research procedures.  
 
Visit 1: Sanders Brown Center on Aging staff will complete a screening visit to obtain consent to participate in the 
study. This wil l take approximately one hour with both the caregiver and patient, and will consist of determining 
baseline symptoms, the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale, physical /neurological examination  of the patient 
over Zoom (approximately 15 minutes with caregi ver facilitation) . 
 
Visit 2:  Baseline data will be collected at Visit 2 consisting of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA ) (with 
patient approximately 15 minutes ). We anticipate this visit will last 1.5 -2 hours  with the patient . All intervention 
materials will be mailed to the  patients’ homes  following visit 2.    
 
Visit 3: Visit [ADDRESS_553656] a virtual meeting 
with research staff to receive training for all intervention materials and initiation of Actigraph  use (wearable wrist 
device) and review adverse events  will be reviewed. This visit will last approximately 1 hour with the caregiver  and 
patient .  [ZIP_CODE]

Visit 4 -8: At the end of each week,  caregivers and patients  will meet with research staff  or occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_436998], you will be asked to demonstrate intervention use 
during video conference. These visits will last less than one hour with the caregiver  and patient .  
 
Visit 9: At the final week of intervention,  patients wil l engage in a follow -up assessment, will engage in a one-hour 
session to involve complete assessment including physical /neurological examination  (with patient approximately 
15 minutes) , and MOCA  (with patient approximately 15 minutes) . 
 
Visit 10: Four weeks following completion of the intervention, participants will complete a follow up session 
consisting of the same visit [ADDRESS_553657] may be via phone, email, or a virtual meeting.  
Please see APPENDIX A: Schedule of Events for visualization of this schedule and explanation of assessments.  
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS?

Statistical Analysis  
Participants ’ characteristics were compared among the three arms using analysis of 
variance ( ANOVA) for continuous measures and chi- square tests or Fisher’s exact for 
categorical measures. The analysis of the primary endpoint used a chi- square test to compare the 
proportion of participants completing at least 75% of the video sessions among the study arms. 
The analysis of all secondary and exploratory endpoints relied on a modified intention -to-treat 
(mITT ) strategy in which participants were included in the analysis only if the dyad completed at 
least one video session. For those endpoints, the main analysis tool was ANCOVA in which the mean value of an endpoint at the end of the intervention period was adjusted for baseline and then compared among the study arms. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in which multiple imputation was used for missing responses at the end of the intervention period (regressed on baseline) and in which the list of covariates included age of the person with AD at baseline and gender of the caregiver when appropriate. These sensitivity analyses did not change any of the conclusions drawn from the reported ANCOVA in Table 3 and are not reported here. A further sensitivity analysis included the measurements made at the four -week follow-up and relied on 
ANCOVA to compare the profile of responses at the end of the intervention and at the four- week 
follow-up each adjusted for baseline. This analysis did not change the conclusions drawn from Table 3 and is not reported here. All analyses were done using PC-SAS, Version 9.4.

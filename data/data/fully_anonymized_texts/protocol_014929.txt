DATA ANALYSIS PLAN (DAP)  
A.Study sample size rationale
Power Calculation  
Sample size calculations for the study were calculated in order to be well -powered to evaluate 
the main primary outcome in Aim 1, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung 
Scale Trial Outcome Index (FACT -L TOI) assessed at baseline and completion of the study 
post-randomization. This measure assesses functional and physical well -being and lung 
cancer specific symptoms, and is the most well described measurement of quality of life in 
lung cancer patients and has been used extensively in clinical tri als. We calculated sample 
sizes assuming a minimum clinically meaningful difference of [ADDRESS_461793] size in the Cella study  [1]. We assume a maximum standard deviation of 11 in 
both arms, an estimate taken from a study done in a similar population of patients and 
matching our  pi[INVESTIGATOR_9958]  [2].  We use a conservative estimate 15% attrition rate based on 
our previous recruitment experience with patients with lung cancer. Correlation within subject 
between baseline and outcome measures is estimated to be between .[ADDRESS_461794] 80% power (with a two -tailed alpha of 0.05), we require 
69 patients per group for a total of 138 patients *. 
Correlation (ρ) ρ=0.4ρ=0.5 ρ=0.6

Further details of our sample size calculation can be found below:  
For a randomized control trial, the hypothesis that will be tested is Ho: δ=μc−μI=0 vs. 
Ha: δ=μc−μI≠0.  According to Friedman et al  [3], the sample size needed for each group for 
conducting a two -tailed test of size α with power of 1 -β is  
𝑛=2 𝜎2 (𝑍𝛼/2+𝑍𝛽)2

Where δ/σ is equivalent to Cohen’s d and Zα/[ADDRESS_461795] normal 
distribution at α/2 and β respectively.  
The final n required for each group to adequately power the study is then : September 30, 2017

Where (1− 𝜌2) is the design factor for an ANCOVA design [4] and 1
1−𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 accounts for the 
highest expected attrition in the study.  
 
 
B. Data collection  
Setting  
The study will be performed at the t hree VA Medical Centers, Puget Sound Health Care System 
(VAPSHCS) , Birmingham VA HCS, and Portland VA Medical Center, all  university -affiliated 
tertiary medical centers.  VAPSHCS  receives approximately 100 new diagnoses of lung cancer 
annually  and provides care to patients with lung cancer for the northern alliance of VISN 20 that 
includes all of Washington State, Alaska, an d Idaho. VAPSHCS provides full diagnostic and 
treatment services for lung cancer including pulmonary medicine, oncology medicine, 
cardiothoracic surgery, and radiation oncology. VAPSHCS  has only in -patient palliative care 
consult service and no outpatient palliative care clinic. The Birmingham VA receives 
approximately 150 new diagnoses of lung cancer annually and provides care to patients with 
lung cancer within VISN 7. The Birmingham VA offers in -patient palliative care consult services 
and no outpatient palliative care services.  The Portland VA receives approximately 1 50 new 
diagnoses of lung cancer annually and provides care to patients with lung cancer within VISN 
20. The Portland  VA offers in -patient palliative care consult services and no outpatient p alliative 
care services . Ancillary care services for all centers include social service, Chaplain service, 
nutrition, home care, and referrals for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125].   
Subjects  
Our study population includes Veterans diagnosed with non -small and small cell lung c ancer 
receiving care at the VA PSHC S, Birmingham VA HCS  and Portland VA HCS.    
 
Identification and recruitment process  
We will recruit individuals (n=138) with lung cancer over a 2.[ADDRESS_461796] (thoracic surgery and 
pulmonary), oncology and radiation oncology clinics. As members who regularly attend the 
tumor board, we are well acquainted with other Tumor Board attendees, including phys icians, 
social workers, and other support staff. Each week, we will review patients who are to be 
presented at Tumor Board, or seen in the Chest (includes pulmonary and thoracic surgery) and 
Oncology Clinics for patients with new diagnoses of lung cancer.  
 
We will mail potential candidates invitation letters and include pre -paid postcards providing an 
opportunity for patients to opt out of the study or to be contact[CONTACT_368847]. We will contact [CONTACT_368848]. Among interested patients, we will take two approaches to obtain informed consent and 
conduct the initial study visit based on patient preference. First, if the patient has an upcoming 
clinical appointment, we will coo rdinate the initial study visit with that clinic visit. Second, 
[ADDRESS_461797] to inform all medical providers of their patients’ 
involvement.  
Patients will receive $50 following randomization into the study, $25 after completing 8 weeks in 
the study and $25 aft er completion of the final assessment for a possible total of $100.   
Measures  
Outcome measures will be collected on all enrolled participants by a research  coordinator  at 
baseline and the final visit. Outcome measures will be collected through surveys over the 
telephone. Prior to data collection, we will mail the surveys to the patient so they can visually 
follow while the research coordinator  asks the questions and rec ords their response. The 
estimated time for completion of the six surveys is approximately 30 -45 minutes based on our 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Subjects did not commonly report being overly burdened by [CONTACT_285889].   
 
C. Method of r andomization  
The unit of randomization will be the patient, performed at a ratio of 1:1 within strata using the 
permuted -block method with block sizes of 4  [3]. Given three stratifying variables of cancer 
stage (early and late), site (Seattle , Birmingham , Portland ) and COPD (yes or no), there will be 
eight strata. Patients from each strata will be assigned to the intervention (I) or the control (C) in 
randomly generated sequences ICIC, IICC, CIIC, and so forth as they enter the trial.   
 
Randomization will be condu cted by a statistician on our study team.  Providers will not be 
specifically informed of patients’ treatment allocation. However , providers cannot be masked 
in this intervention trial and will have access to the research notes entered into CPRS by [CONTACT_368849]. The research coordinator  collecting baseline and final visit outcome measures 
will be blinded to the subject’s treatment allocation.  
 
D. Interim analysis of the data  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_368843], efficacy, and futili ty for the study. This 
determination was made based on previous studies incorporating palliative care interventions 
into routine care finding improvements in quality of life and depression for patients with 
advanced cancers. ER visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], an d death are expected for patients with 
advanced cancers. These events are due to the underlying disease or side effects from cancer 
treatments, not from a palliative care intervention.  This study does not involve investigational 
medications or devices. Pat ients will continue to receive standard of clinical care for their lung 
cancer during the study.  
During our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], no complaints were received from study participants regarding the study 
procedures and there were no reported unanticipated serious adverse events due to study 
participation. Therefore, the study’s sample size should not be impacted .    
The data safety monitoring board will assess and respond to complaints and monitor all deaths, 
4 
 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and ER visits.  In the unlikely event that any unanticipated adverse events are 
identified, they will be reported appropriately to the fac ility’s IRB. As stated in the consent forms, 
a provider may also withdraw specific patients without their consent for medical or other 
reasons.  
 
 
If at any time during the course of the study, the DSMB judges that risk to subjects may 
significantly outweigh the potential benefit, the DSMB shall have the discretion and 
responsibility to request all necessary information for detailed analyses, and if warranted, 
recommend that the study be terminated. Reason to stop the trial may include a  significant 
number of adverse events that can reasonably be attributed to participation in the study, inability 
to recruit and measure the required number of participants to conduct the primary outcome 
analyses, serious deviation from study protocols, or other circumstances that would render the 
study unlikely to produce scientifically valid findings. The DSMB will carefully weigh the risk of 
completing the trial as planned against the risk of prematurely stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_368844].  
 
E. Missing  data 
 
We will make every effort to obtain complete data on each study participant at all data 
collection points. Collecting survey data via telephone with the study coordinator documenting 
responses will facilitate complete data. However, some missing dat a is inevitable and creates 
a risk for selection bias that can skew results.  Pri or to evaluating our primary and secondary 
aims, we will perform multiple imputation (MI) which relies on the assumption that the outcome 
measure is missing at random (MAR)  [5].  Datasets resulting from the multiple imputation 
procedure will be analyzed separately and the results from each data set will be summarized 
into one summary set of findings the ease of which is facilitated by [CONTACT_368850].  
 
F. Definition of covariates included in adjustment models  
Prior to the analysis of the specific study aims, descriptive statistics, means and standard 
deviations for the quantitative variables, and frequencies and percentages for the categorical 
variables, wi ll be calculated. All surveys will be scored according to the instructions. 
Differences between the intervention and control groups in baseline characteristics and 
clinical outcomes will be assessed using chi -squared tests for categorical variables and t -tests 
for continuous variables. The primary hypotheses we will test the effect of the intervention on 
improving quality of life scores (includes symptoms).  
Analysis of Aim 1  
H1: Among patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer, provision of a telephone -base d 
palliative care intervention will be associated with a change in FACT -L TOI.  
 
The outcome measure for this hypothesis is quality of life as measured by [CONTACT_92349] -L TOI.  
FACT -L TOI includes functional and physical well -being and lung cancer specific sympt oms.  
We will assess the difference in FACT -L TOI between the intervention and control subjects. 
Patient will be the unit of analysis and we will use a multiple linear regression model  to 
estimate the effect of the treatment group on patient outcome, adjus ting baseline FACT -L TOI 
as well as for randomization groupi[INVESTIGATOR_368845] (site, cancer stage and diagnosis of COPD). 
This approach is referred to as analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).  A multiple linear regression 
model  will be constructed using FACT -L TOI a s the outcome variable and include treatment 
[ADDRESS_461798] -L TOI score. The 
linear model for  this analysis takes the following form:  
𝑌1 = 𝑎 + 𝑏(treatment group)+ 𝑐(𝑌0) + 𝒅(Xi-j) + 𝜀 
Where 𝑌1 = FACT -L TOI at the end of the study period, treatment group = intervention or 
control group, 𝑌0 = baseline FACT -L TOI, and X i-j randomization groupi[INVESTIGATOR_368845] (cancer 
stage, site, and COPD).   
 
We will conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate if a dif ference exists between inference drawn 
using the multiple imputed datasets and complete case analyses.  Additionally, we will conduct 
sensitivity analysis by [CONTACT_368851] (race and FEV 1) in the model both 
together and individually to  complement and elucidate primary results.  
 
Secondary Aims  
 
For secondary aim [ADDRESS_461799] [6] to analyze the change in the score from baseline to the fina l visit.  
 
For secondary aim 3 , we will assess if the intervention will make a difference in improving the 
level of concordance between the clinicians’ knowledge of the patients’ life -sustaining 
treatment. Item responses for these questions are ordinal. We will use Wilcoxon rank sum test 
to analyze the difference between the subjects’ and providers’ responses.  
 
For secondary aim 4 , we will determine if the provision of palliative care integrated at the time 
of lung cancer diagnosis improves appropriate resou rce utilization (pharmacy, social work, 
dietician, spi[INVESTIGATOR_60408], psychology, and PT/OT) as compared to the usual care group. We will 
collect data on health care utilization from CDW at the end of the study period (3 years). 
Measures include: 1) number of  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614] (for any reason); 2) number of intensive 
care admissions; 3) use of mechanical ventilation or no use of mechanical ventilation; 4) the 
number of Emergency Department visits (for any reason); 5) number of cancer treatments 
(chemotherapy ); 6) number of radiation treatments – definitive or curative; 7) fee service for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677]; and 8) survival status. Referrals to system interdisciplinary resources (pharmacy, 
social work, dietician, spi[INVESTIGATOR_60408], psychology, and PT/OT) will be monitor ed on a monthly 
basis for all enrolled subjects.  
 
G. Prospective tracking of serious adverse events  
Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
An external  and independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be established to 
examine interim study results on a periodic, scheduled basis and to recommend early 
termination due to the burden of participation if warranted. The issues that are raised in these 
interviews bring up sensitive subjects among a terminally ill group of patients and it is 
[ADDRESS_461800] s ymptoms of depression.  If this situation occurs, we will inform the 
Primary Care Physician and refer the patient to Mental Health services for further evaluation.  
In the unlikely but possible detection of suicidal ideation, the following protocol will be  followed:  
 
The interviewer will ask, “You mentioned that you have had thoughts that you would be better 
off dead or hurting yourself in some way.  Do you have a plan for how you would hurt yourself?”  
If the subject says: “I would not actually hurt myself ”, the interviewer may continue with the 
interview.  If the subject endorses a plan, the interviewer would proceed as follows: “Our 
highest priority is keepi[INVESTIGATOR_368846].  I would like to have one of our study doctors call you 
to make sure you are safe .” 
 
If the Veteran indicates he/she is safe, but does not want to be evaluated by a study doctor or 
mental health provider, let him/her know you will need to contact [CONTACT_368852]/her safety.  In the case of possible suicidal int ention or ideation, the Veteran will be 
provided with the VA Suicide Hotline number.  
 
If the Veteran indicates he/she will wait for an evaluation from the study doctor or mental health 
provider, thank him/her and let him/her know that a doctor will be seeing him/her soon.  Then 
call the mental health provider/study doctor to see the Veteran and assess his/her suicidality.  
 
 
DSMB Role  
The DSMB will provide the investigators and the IRB s with objective, scientific monitoring of the 
conduct of the study fr om the standpoint of ensuring the protection of  human subjects and the 
integrity of the trial. It will do so by [CONTACT_368853]  (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) and the quality of data, as well as reviewing and  assessing the 
performance of the study’s operations. The DSMB will convene with the  investigators at least 
semi-annually to review study progress and provide objective  recommendations, as appropriate, 
with respect to:  
•       Determination of any actions to be taken in response to AEs and SAEs reported during 
the study;  
•       Reports related to study operations and the quality of the data;  
•       Consideration of early termination of the study because of treatment safety concerns 
or inadequate performance;  
•       Modifications in the study protocol concerning recruitment, participant retention, data 
quality, outcome assessment, statistical analysis, or general trial operations.  
At the end of each meeting, DSMB members will make a recommendation regarding the  
continuat ion of the trial and the date and format of the next meeting. The DSMB's findings and  
recommendations will be documented in the meeting minutes and transmitted to the 
[ADDRESS_461801] staff will be trained to identify and report all potential AEs. To  ensure unbiased 
determination across treatment arms, we will systematically identify AEs by [CONTACT_368854]/or patients at each scheduled data collection time -point. AEs discovered will be investigated 
and reported to the IRB and DSMB according to required timelines. The DSMB may request 
additional information if it deems additional deliberation is warranted. The project direc tor and/or 
analyst will prepare a statistical summary of the numbers and types of all AEs (serious or not), 
by [CONTACT_368855], for the investigators and the DSMB on a quarterly basis. At the 
discretion of the DSMB, the Chair may request unblin ded results in order to determine the 
nature and extent of effect of the experimental intervention. Should the DSMB make this 
request, it will be fulfilled following a procedure that will maintain blinding of the investigators 
and the staff involved in fol low-up data collection and analysis. If, at any time, the investigators 
believe they are seeing an unexpected increase in AEs that is a cause of concern, this will be 
specifically brought to the attention of the DSMB and their advice will be sought. This 
systematic, non -biased monitoring process will ensure that any group disparities will be 
effectively addressed.

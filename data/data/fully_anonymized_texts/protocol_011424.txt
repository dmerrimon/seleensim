TITLE OF THE STUDY:  An open- label, randomized, controlled, multicenter, phase II study evaluating 
safety and efficacy of intratumorally administered Intuvax pre- nephrectomy followed by [CONTACT_890947] -
nephrectomy, compared to Sunitinib post -nephrectomy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients  
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary objectives are: 
• To evaluate median overall survival ( OS) from randomization in metastatic renal cell carcinoma 
(mRCC) patients overall and by [CONTACT_6496], i.e. in high- risk and in intermediate- risk patients 
separately, receiving two (2) vaccine doses of Intuvax pre- nephrectomy, followed by s unitinib 
initiated five  (5) to eight (8) weeks post -nephrectomy and in non- vaccinated mRCC patients 
receiving s unitinib initiated five  (5) to eight (8)  weeks post -nephrectomy  
• To evaluate 18- month survival rate from randomization in mRCC patients overall and by 
[CONTACT_6496], i.e. in high- risk and in intermediate- risk patients separately, receiving two (2) vaccine 
doses of Intuvax pre- nephrectomy followed by s unitinib post -nephrectomy and in non-
vaccinated patients receiving s unitinib post -nephrectomy  
The secondary objectives are: 
• To evaluate safety and tolerability in high- and intermediate- risk mRCC patients receiving two 
(2) vaccine doses of Intuvax pre- nephrectomy followed by s unitinib post -nephrectomy and in 
non-vaccinated patients receiving s unitinib post -nephrectomy  
• To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criteria from Sunitinib Start Visit in intermediate- and high- risk mRCC 
patients after receiving two (2) vaccine doses of Intuvax pre- nephrectomy followed by s unitinib 
post-nephrectomy and in non- vaccinated patients receiving s unitinib post -nephrectomy * 
• To evaluate response and its durat ion according to RECIST 1.1 criteria from Sunitinib Start Visit 
in intermediate- and high- risk mRCC patients receiving two (2) vaccine doses of Intuvax 
pre-nephrectomy followed by s unitinib post -nephrectomy and in non- vaccinated patients 
receiving s unitinib post -nephrectomy * 
• To evaluate time to progression (TTP) from Sunitinib Start Visit in intermediate- and high- risk 
mRCC patients receiving two (2) vaccine doses of Intuvax pre- nephrectomy followed by 
[CONTACT_890948] -nephrectomy and in non- vaccinated patients receiving sunitinib post -
nephrectomy * 
• To evaluate the number  of infiltrating CD8+ T -cells in available diagnostic pre- biopsy (sample 
from either primary tumor or metastasis acceptable) and in the resected primary renal tumor in 
intermediate- and high- risk mRCC patients receiving two (2) vaccine doses of Intuvax 
pre-nephrectomy and in non- vaccinated patients  
*Note : For intermediate- risk patients included in the trial according to protocol versions before 
version Final 4.0, baseline for PFS, response and its duration, and TTP is defined as the first 
imaging assessment  after nephrectomy.

and seven (7) in the intermediate group, according to the Heng prognos tic model  [4]. The 
Intuvax injections were performed with the patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_890925] ( 3) days to ensure safe 
care, collection of vital signs and blood samples. The vaccinations were performed twice, 
14 days apart , in all patients . Nephrectomy was performed two (2) weeks after the second 
vaccination. Three (3) different dose levels of DCs ; 5 x106, 10 x106, and 20  x106, were 
administered . 
No serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the vaccination were noted. Transient fever 
reactions with duration less than one ( 1) day and rash was noted in 5 out of 12 patients . All 
patients survived the postoperative three ( 3) month follow -up visit. No significant deviations 
in blood chemistry attributable to the vaccination procedure  were noted. Accidental bile duct 
injury was inflicted in one  (1) patient resulting in transient hepatic failure. The renal function 
was decreased after nephrectomy  in all patients  as expected but no further decrease was 
observed except for  one (1) patient  who developed progressive renal function deterioration 
due to a previously undetected plasma  cell disorder/myeloma. There were no signs of any 
autoimmune reactions as measured by [CONTACT_890951] a humoral donor -specific 
alloimmunization was seen in three ( 3) patients.  
An increased number of tumor -specific lymphocy tes were  seen after vaccination in nine ( 9) 
patients indicating a systemic immune response . A dense infiltration of CD8+ T -cells was 
found in seven ( 7) nephrectomy specimens. Nephrectomy specimens with dense 
intratumoral T -cell infiltration exhibited only few and scattered CD8+ T -cells within the 
surrounding normal kidney parenchyma. These findings, together with the fact that the 
remaining renal function was not decreased more than anticipated, indicate that the 
observed cellular immune response was tumor specific and not directed towards normal 
renal structures.  No correlation between Intuvax dose and intratumoral lymphocyte infiltration 
was observed. The degree of HLA -mismatch between vaccine- DCs and the patient was not 
correlating with degree of intratumoral CD8+ T- cell infiltration  in this study . 
The selected patient population had primary mRCC and consequently  they can be 
considered as  a poor prognostic group per se. In addition, unfavorable histology with 
sarcomatoid differentiation was more common than anticipated  prior to study start ; six (6) 
tumors  presented sarcomatoid differentiation. Four (4) of these exhibited an extensive 
sarcomatoid differentiation ( >20% of the tumor tissue), reflecting a highly unfavorable clinical 
presentation. All patients have progressed after nephrectomy  and six (6) patients have 
received additional treatment with TKIs . The median OS in the subgroup of five ( 5) patients 
with high -risk/poor prognos is according to Heng criteria, of which four (4) patients have 
received additional TKI treatment , was 24.[ADDRESS_1247296] been given after progression to some patients.  
In conclusion, the observed intratumoral infiltration of potentially cytotoxic CD8+  T-cells merit 
further studies in order to correlate this finding with clinical outcome. No  correlation of DC 
dose and the immune response in the kidney  could be identified. Circulating vaccine- DCs 
were transiently found in a minority of patients and usually in low numbers . 
Fully mature  allogeneic  DCs have previously been tested  in approximately  100 RCC patients  
using different administration routes [9,10,11,12,13]. These  studies  provi de  additional 
supporting safety  information  of the use of allogenic  DC-based vaccines  in treatment  of RCC.  
Only mild AEs have been reported and no SAEs  have been observed.  The most  commonly  
reported AEs in those studies were local reactions  at the administration  site (rash) and fever.  
No signs  of autoimmunity  have  been observed.

7.1 Study Design and Plan -Description  
The study is an open- label, randomized, controlled, two (2) armed, multicenter, phase II 
study . Intermediate - and high-risk mRCC patients  according to Heng criteria are eligible for 
participation [ 4]. Stratified randomization based on Heng- risk categories applies . The patients 
are randomized in a consecutive order to one (1) of the following two  (2) treatment arms  
when eligibility has been confirmed ; 
(i) T wo (2) doses of Intuvax  (10x106 DCs) administered intratumorally into the 
primary tumor 14 ± [ADDRESS_1247299] three ( 3) 
days after  the second vaccine dose.  
AND  
Sunitinib treatmen t initiated five (5) to eight (8) weeks after nephrectomy , 
administered dose in accordance with the SmPC/USPI . 
(ii) Sunitinib treatment initiated five (5) to eight (8) weeks after nephrectomy, 
administered dose in  accordance with the SmPC/USPI . 
The estimated  number of patients to be randomized in the study is  around  90. The patients 
will be randomized in a 2:1 ( vaccine treatment arm [i] :control treatment arm [ii] ) ratio. 
Stratification will be done at randomization for intermediate - and high- risk patients . 
Patients randomized to t reatment arm (i) are scheduled for  12 study visits  and patients 
randomized to treatment arm (ii) are scheduled for [ADDRESS_1247300] below and Figure 1 . In addition, all patients being exposed to any of the 
Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs)  will have a safety evaluation done for collection of 
SAEs up to [ADDRESS_1247301] dose of IMP administered in the study . The following visits 
apply for the two (2) patient populations:  
• Screening Visit (Screening)  
• Vaccination 1 V isit (Vacc1) , applicable for patients randomized to treatment arm (i)  
• Vacc ination 2 V isit (Vacc2) , applicable for patients randomized to treatment ar m (i) 
• Nephrectomy Visit (Nephrectomy)  
• Sunitinib Start V isit (Sun -Start), five (5) to eight (8)  weeks after Nephrectomy  
• Sunitinib Follow -up Visits  (SFU[6W] and SFU[12W]), every [ADDRESS_1247302]  
• Sunitinib Follow -up Visits (SFU[24W], SFU[36W], SFU[48W], and SFU[60W]), every 
[ADDRESS_1247303]  
• End-of-Study Visit (End -of-Study)  
At the two (2)  Vaccination Visits, the patients will be adm inistered Intuvax (10 x106 DCs) 
intratumorally in the viable part of their primary tumor . Vaccine from the same batch ( i.e. the 
same donor)  will be used at both occasions . The patient will stay at the clinic at least 
four (4) hours after vaccination.  Nephrectomy  is done at least 3 days after the second 
vaccination and maximum 63 days after Screening. Sunitinib  treatment is initiated  five (5) to 
eight (8)  weeks after nephrectomy, administered dose is in accordance with the SmPC/USPI . 
All patients will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_890954] (AEs)
 or have any concerns . If follow -up of any symptoms is needed

Confidential  Page 38  of 87  7.3 Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
Intuvax is developed as an immune primer for cancer treatment that preferably should be 
combined with a drug that acts in synergy with Intuvax by [CONTACT_890956] -induced 
immunosuppression. In this study , Intuvax is given in combination with sunitinib, which like 
several other TKIs is known to inhibit myeloid- derived suppressor cells [ 25]. Based on 
current ESMO and NCCN guidelines [26, 27, 28] today’s standard  of care both in US and in 
the majority  of the European countries involves initiation of  systemic treatment with a TKI 
(including sunitinib or pazopanib) approximately [ADDRESS_1247326] nephrectomy for all patients 
regardless of prognosis, i.e. poor (high risk) or intermediate. It is anticipated that all patient s 
will benefit more from vaccination with Intuvax the sooner  TKI treatment is initiated after 
performed nephrectomy.   
Sunitinib alone was chosen as the active control for the study  based on its documented 
positive impact on tumor res ponse, PFS and OS in patients with mRCC . As discussed in 
Section 5.2 it is hypothesized that sunitinib might  contribute to an increased Intuvax efficacy.

Survival data (including post -study survival data if applicable) will be collected and analyzed 
for all patients withdrawn from the study , Section  11.3.  
Patients randomized to Intuvax who withdraw from the study before administr ation of the first 
dose of Intuvax will be considered screening  failures.  Patients randomized to sunitinib  alone 
who withdraw from the study before any assessments made at the first visit following 
Screening will be considered screening  failures.  
Only patients considered screening failures will be replaced.

Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
• The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the patient s 
enrolled in the study, or potential study patient s 
• A decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of 
Intuvax  
If the CA obtains information that raises doubts about the safety or scientific validity of the 
clinical study, the CA can suspend or prohibit the study . Before the CA reaches its decision it 
shall, except where there is immi nent risk, ask the Sponsor and/ or the Investigator for their

9.2 Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment Groups 
At Screening the patient will be assigned a site specific screening number. This  number will 
be generated automatically by [INVESTIGATOR_529212]- on-Line, the electronic data capture (EDC) system used 
in the study . The screening number will be in the following format XX -YYYY. The letter XX is 
the site number and YYY Y the consecutive patient number starting at 100 1 at each site.  The 
screening number will be used to identify the patient throughout trial participation.  
Two (2) randomization lists are generated by  [CONTACT_2329] a global randomization system . 
One (1) to be used for randomization of high- risk patients and one (1)  to be used for 
randomization of interme diate- risk patients. One (1) copy of each randomization list is kept in 
a sealed envelope in a locked cabinet at  and one (1) copy is sent to the IWRS provider.  
Randomization codes will be strictly sequential within blocks as patients are eligible for 
randomization. The randomization code will not be available to any person involved in the 
conduct or evaluation of the trial before the trial database is locked.  
When all results from the assessments made at Screening are available and the Investigator 
has confirmed eligibility and Heng- risk category for the patient  the study coordinator will log 
into the IWRS and receive randomization and treatment information.  The study nurse will 
make a telephone contact [CONTACT_890960].  NB: If local regulations and laws require  a confirmatory diagnostic biopsy before 
vaccination (i.e. systemic treatment)  patient s randomized to Intuvax  will be booked for a 
biopsy collection visit prior to Vacc1 Visit. All participa ting US patients need a diagnostic pre -
biopsy made at Screening in order to evaluate eligibility for sunitinib treatment following 
nephrectomy.  
In case a patient randomized to Intuvax and sunitinib treatment withdraws prior to first dose 
of Intuvax or a patient randomized to sunitinib treatment only withdraws prior to any 
assessments made at the first visit following Screening they are considered screening 
failures , Section 8.5. A patient withdrawal  contact  [CONTACT_890961] I WRS a llowing for

short axis will be measured and followed.  
• Baseline documentation of “Target” and “Non- Target” lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and 
recorded and measured at baseline.  
- Target lesions . Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size 
(lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not 
lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the 
diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
- Non-target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as 
non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
b) Response Criteria 
Table 4 Target Lesions Evaluation Criteria

Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non- target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level  
Progressive Disease (PD)  Appearance of  one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesionsa Complete Response (CR)  Disapp earance of all target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters  
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm. ( NB: the appearance of one or more new 
lesions is also considered progression).  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference t he smallest 
sum diameters while on study

Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
Sunitinib until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general,  the subject's best response 
assignment will depend on the achievement of the measurement criteria.

Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
Note: For intermediate- risk patients included in the trial according to protocol versions before 
version Final 4.0, the first imaging assessment  after nephrectomy will be used as baseline for 
evaluation of best overall response , irrespective of whether or not the imaging assessment  
coincided with sunitinib treatment start. Further details will be provided in the SAP.  
Definitions for Response Evaluation  
a) Confirmation of Response 
To be assigned a status of complete or partial response, changes in tumor measurements do 
not need to  be confirmed by [CONTACT_890966].  
b) Response rate  
To be  evaluated as the highest observed score of  response during the study  after 
randomisation in the ordinal categories of CR, PR, PD, SD and “Not evaluable”. The 
response rate  will be evaluated according to the Schedule of Study Event s, Section 7.2.1 . 
c) Objective response   
Is defined  as the proportion of patients with CR and PR.  
d) Disease control rate (DCR)  
Also called Clinical Benefit Rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR or PR or 
Stable Disease (SD).

used for evaluation of response rate from start of sunitinib , Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Note: For 
intermediate- risk patients included in the trial according to protocol versions before version 
Final 4.0, the  first imaging assessment (i.e. CT scan) after nephrectomy will be used.  
Centrally assessed CT scans performed in conjunction with screening  and at the first  
post-nephrectomy assessment  will be used to assess tumor response  rate between 
screening and the first imaging assessment (i.e. CT scan ) post-nephrectomy . 
The following information will be collected and used for the assessments if response is  CR, 
PR, PD, SD, or “Not evaluable”:  
• Date of Abdomen CT scan 
• Date of Thorax CT scan  
• Site of metastases (including specification of target and non- target lesions  at Sun-
Start Visit five ( 5) to eight ( 8) week s after nephrectomy  see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and [ 1]) 
• Sum of the diameters for all target lesions , see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and [ 1] 
• New lesions, see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and [ 1] 
If CT cannot be used for some reason, MRI is acceptable. The same modality has to be used 
at all visit s. 
 
10.4.4  Prior and Concomitant Medication/Therapy  
Prior medication/therapy is defined as medication/therapy administered prior to Screening 
Visit. All medication/therapy administered after Screening Visit are considered concomitant 
medication/therapy.  Prior medication/therapy will be indicated as past or ongoing at 
Screening.  
Prior medications taken within one (1) month  prior to Screening and current ongoing 
treatment will be recorded at the S creening Visit on the concomitant medication page of the 
eCRF . Changes in concomitant medications will be recorded at all following visits throughout 
the study . For information on Co ncomitant Medication restrictions,  see Section 9.6. 
The following information will be collected and recorded in the eCRF: Drug name (product 
name), route, dose and units, frequency, indication, reference to AE if applicable, start date, 
end date or ongoing at the end of the study will be recorded.  
Coding of prior and concomitant medications will be done using World Health Organization 
(WHO) Drug Dicti onary.  
 
10.4.5  Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) 
A standard 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recording will be  performed according to local 
practice at Screening for identification of any heart failure. An overall interpretation of the 
ECG as “Normal” or “Abnormal” will be done. If an abnormal finding is considered clinical 
significant the patient will not qualify for participation in the study.  
 
10.4.6  Serology  
Blood samples for HIV, HBV and HCV will be collected and analy zed at Screening. Presence 
of any of these infections is an exclusion criterion.

Comment:  An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
IMP, whether or not considered related to the IMP. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_1247376] and unintended responses to an IMP  related to any dose administered.  
Comment:  All AEs judged by [CONTACT_96949] a 
reasonable causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse reactions. The expression reasonable causal relationship means to convey in general that there is evidence 
or argument to suggest a causal relationship.  
11.1.[ADDRESS_1247377] information (e.g. Investigator's B rochure for an unauthori zed IMP or SmPC /USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_890941]).  
Comment:  When the outcome of the adverse reaction is not consistent with the applicable 
product information this adverse reaction should be considered as unexpected.  
11.1.[ADDRESS_1247378] that at any dose : 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_890942] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
Comments: Life-threatening in the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE) or serious 
adverse reaction refers to an event in which the patient  was at risk of death at the time of 
event; it  does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it w as 
more severe.  
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an AE /reaction is serious in other 
situat ions. Important AEs/ reactions that are not immediately life- threatening or do not result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_890943], should also be considered serious.  
11.2 Reporting of Adverse Events 
Adverse event reporting and data management will be performed according to the following relevant guidelines:

• CPMP/ICH/E2A/377/95 (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definition and Standards 
for Expedited Repor ting),  
• CPMP/ICH/135/95 (GCP),  
• 21 CFR 312.32 (FDA).  
All study patient s will be carefully monitored for the occurrence of AEs during the study 
period from Screening V isit to the completion of the End -of-Study  Visit. SAEs will be 
collected until completion of the End- of-Study Visit or up to [ADDRESS_1247380] AEs with a non -leading  question 
such as “have you experienced any new health problems or worsening of existing conditions” as well as reporting events directly observed or spontaneously volunteered by [CONTACT_4676] s. 
Clearly related signs, symptoms and abnormal diagnostic procedure results should be grouped together and reported as a single diagnosis or syndrome whenever possible.  
All AEs including but not limited to events reported by [CONTACT_102] , or reported in answer to an 
open question by [CONTACT_890975], which fall into any of the above 
definitions must be recorded as an  AE in the eCRF and should include the following 
information:  
• Brief description of the event (diagnosis)  
• Start date (and time, if relevant)  
• Stop date (and time, if relevant) (or resolution)  
• Severity  
• Action taken regarding IMP 
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_67235] c ausality  
• Seriousness  
• Outcome  
The general term “Progressive Disease” ( PD) should not be used when reporting an  AE. 
Instead, all symptoms, laboratory findings etc. including those that could be a reflection of PD 
should always be reported.  
Severity describes the intensity of an event, and will be assessed using the NCI CTCAE 
version 4.0 [ 2]. The CTCAE  displays Grades 1  through 5 with unique clinical  descriptions of 
severity for each AE based on this  general guideline. The term Grade refers to the severity of 
the AE. The followi ng grades are used:  
Grade 1 (Mild) 
Asymptomatic or mild  symptoms  OR clinical or diagnostic  observations only  OR intervention 
not indicated.  
Grade 2 (Moderate) 
Minimal, local or  noninvasive intervention indicated OR limiting age -appropriate instrumental 
Activities of D aily Living (ADL) . (Instrumenta l ADL refer to preparing meals,  shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16208], using the  telephone, managing money, etc. )

Grade 4 (Life-threatening consequences )  
Urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 (Death related to AE ) 
If an AE changes in severity, the worst severity should be reported.  
Causality  
Causality will be assessed as : 
Probable 
A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the IMP, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfil this definition.  
Possible  
A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the IMP, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_19009]. Information on IMP  withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Unlikely  
A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to IMP  
administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
Follow -up of Patient s after Adverse E vents 
Any AE that is ongoing when the patient  is withdrawn from the study should be followed up 
until the AE is resolved or the Investigator decides that the AE is stable and needs no further follow -up. 
Abnormal Laboratory Values/Vital Signs  
The reporting of abnormalities as both laboratory /vital signs  findings and AEs should be 
avoided.  
An asymptomatic abnormal laboratory /vital sign  finding should only be reported as an AE if it 
is clinically significant, if it fulfils the criteria for an SAE or if it causes the patient  to 
discontinue the study.  
If an abnormal laboratory /vital sign  value is associated with clinical signs and symptoms , the 
sign/symptom should be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory /vital sign  result 
should be considered additional information.

SAEs detected during the safety evaluation will be recorded in the eCRF and reported to 
 Drug Safety in accordance with the procedure presented in Sectio n 11.3. 
 
11.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAEs are reported to the S ponsor 
immediately, but in any event no later than 24 hours of any site staff becoming aware of the 
event. Initial reports should be followed as soon as possible by [CONTACT_197133]. The 
initial and follow -up reports should identify patient s by [CONTACT_890977] . The patient ’s names, personal identification numbers, and/or addresses  must not be 
included. The following information is mandatory  for the initial report:  
• Patient  study ID  
• Study treatment (blinded, if applicable)  
• Start date (time, if relevant) of the stu dy treatment  
• Brief description of the event (diagnosis)  
• Start date (time, if relevant) of the event  
• Seriousness criteria  
• Causality  assessment  
For reported deaths, the Investigator should supply the Sponsor and the IRB/ IEC (if 
applicable) with any additional requested information (e.g. autopsy reports and terminal 
medical reports).  
Detailed instructions describing the procedure of reporting SAEs including Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions ( S[LOCATION_003]Rs ), Section 11.4, will be distributed to the 
site and all involved parties at the Sponsor and  prior to study start. 
As a principle, all SAEs must be documented and medically assessed by [CONTACT_890978] . 
Follow -up of Post -Study Survival Information 
Sites having patients who  are still alive after the entire study has ended will be asked to seek 
survival i nformation in medical records or databases (including public records).  
The patient’s survival information after the patient’s End- of-study Visit will be reported to the 
safety database only, i.e. will not be included in the clinical database. A survival report form 
should be used for such reporting.  
Post-study survival information will be collected as follows : 
• Collection of survival data f or the  individual patient; at the  [ADDRESS_1247384] 
randomization time point  
• A complete collection for all applicable patients; at the time of study end (Section 7.5) 
• A complete collection for  all applicable patients; at the last patient’s [ADDRESS_1247385] 
randomization time point and thereafter yearly  up to 5  years  
Updated information on median OS, will be reported to the authorities/IRBs/IECs as 
addendum(s) to the Clinical Study Report and also as part of the development safety update 
reports (DSUR s).

11.4 SAE and S[LOCATION_003]R Reporting to CAs, IRBs/IECs, and Investigators  
The Sponsor is responsible for informing all concerned CAs, IRB/IECs, and all clinical study 
investigators utilizing Intuvax  of any individual case reports of SAEs that are determined to 
be reportable by [CONTACT_1034] (i.e. S[LOCATION_003]Rs). For a S[LOCATION_003]R that is fatal or life -threatening, 
this should be reported as soon as possible and not later than [ADDRESS_1247388] other 
patients or the study at risk.  
The Investigator will ensure that all relevant information is provided to the Sponsor to allow the Sponsor to meet their obligations to report the S[LOCATION_003]R to the CA s and IRBs/ IECs. 
Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to comply with any applicable site-
specific requirements related to the reporting of SAEs (other than S[LOCATION_003]Rs) involving his/her 
patients to the IRB/IEC that approved the trial. The Sponsor  must obtain adequate 
documentation showing that the IRB/ IEC was properly  and promptly notified as required.  
 
11.5 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
The following AEs are classified as DLTs:  
• Any AE of CTCAE grade 3 or higher ( except for fever CTCAE grade 4 as this is an 
expected sign  of immunologic response after vaccination), and assessed as possibly 
or probably related to Intuvax  within the interval between the first vaccination and the 
subsequent one (i.e. the DLT observation period) 
• Any autoimmune reaction CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_1247389] be reported to the CRO using the same 
procedures and in the same timelines as is applicable for SAEs.  
A DLT should be reported as an AE assessed as possibly or probably related to Intuvax as 
applicable. If a DLT fulfils any criterion for an SAE it should be reported as such.

after the last visit, if they believe that conception occurred during their participation in the 
study.  
A pregnancy as such is not an AE, unless there is a possibility that the IMP has interfered 
with the efficiency of any contraceptive measures. However, the Investigator should report 
pregnancies according to  the procedures and timelines described for reporting of SAEs  
(Section 11.3). The pregnancy report form should be used instead of the SAE form.  
The pregnant patient  or partner will be followed until the end of the pregnancy. Any 
complication during the p regnancy should preferably be reported as an AE . The outcome of 
the pregnancy must be reported on the pregnancy report form. Any spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, birth defect/congenital anomaly, death, or other serious infant condition must be reported and followed up as an SAE.

Survival functions will be displayed graphically using Kaplan- Meier plots, and life table 
statistics will be produced including summaries of number of events and censored 
observations. Estimates of 25%, 50% (median) and 75% percentiles of time of survival with corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. A nalysis wh ere the survival 
functions will be compared between Intuvax +sunitinib, vs. sunitinib alone will be conducted 
using a log -rank tes t. Time to death in this analysis will be defined as the time from 
randomization until the event occurs.  
In addition the primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated using the PPS. 
18-month survival rate  
The primary endpoint 18 -month survival rate after randomization in high -risk and 
intermediate- risk mRCC patients  will be calcul ated and compared overall and by [CONTACT_890979].

of patients in each analysis set will be included. The patient disposition will be made 
separately by [CONTACT_504176].  
Demographic, medical surgical history  and other baseline data will be presented using 
summary statistics based on the safety  set overall and split by [CONTACT_64264].  
 
12.1.10  Exposure to Treatment  
All details collected in relation to the Intuvax vaccination will be listed and tabulated if 
applicable. Nephrectomy data will be listed. Exposure data for sunitinib use will be listed per 
treatment group and stratum . 
 
12.1.11  Concomitant Treatment  
Concomitant medication and concomitant therapy will be summarized as number of patient s 
being treated with each  type of medication/therapy classified according to ATC level [ADDRESS_1247401] 
one (1) AE, the total number of AEs, the number of unique AEs per treatment group and in 
total. The number of AEs per severity (CTCAE) and relation to trial drug will also be included 
and summarized per treatm ent group and in total. SAEs will be summarized in a similar 
manner.  
The number of patients and the number of AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_99130]. AEs will also be tabulated versus worst severity and worst relationship to treatment. In this table, patients with AEs will be identified by [CONTACT_412353].  
AEs occurring during the [ADDRESS_1247402] Intuvax dose 
(for vaccinated patients) and between first assessment at Screening and Nephrectomy (for

Laboratory Safety Assessments  
For laboratory data, summary statistics will be produced for observed values and for changes 
from screening to each visit  as described in Section 12.1.4. In addition, the number of 
abnormal and clinically significant observations will be tabulated for each treatment group by [CONTACT_765]. Abnormal values will be flagged in listings.  
Shift tables will show the number of patient s who changed from below, within or above the 
reference range at Screening to below, within or above the reference range at each time of 
assessment. 
12.2 Determination of Sample Size  
This is a  proof of concept study and the number of patients chosen is based on practical 
considerations and not on a formal statistical power calculation. With around 90 patients 
randomized 2:1 to vaccination and control, it is expected that 18- month survival rate for high -
risk and intermediate -risk mRCC patients overall can be adequately estimated for exploratory 
purposes but not to confirm the findings as statistical significant .

Sponsor:  Terumo Blood and Cell Technologies   
Study Title:  An In Vivo 24- Hour Recovery Study of Leukoreduced RBCs After Automated 
Separation of Whole Blood by [CONTACT_178605] 42 Days  
Study Number : CTS-5085  
Device 
Description:  The Reveos® Automated Blood Processing System (Reveos  system) is an automated 
whole blood processing system, not cleared for use in the [LOCATION_002].  The Reveos System has been available outside the [LOCATION_002] since 2012 and is seeking United 
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance as  an automated whole 
blood processor.  
The Reveos S ystem is an integrated manufacturing system that processes whole bl ood 
(WB)  units into blood components and designed to minimize manual blood processing 
variables  resulting from  processing time , product and procedural variability. The Reveos 
System consists of the primary device (equipment) that uses centrifugal force to separate 
whole blood into its components, a disposable blood bag set to collect and store 
separated components, and a software program to manage the operations.  
The Reveos disposable  blood bag set contains CPD  (citrate phosphate dextrose) 
anticoagulant,  additive solution formula 5 (AS -5), and a red blood cell (RBC) 
leukoreduction filter.  
The Reveos S ystem can simultaneously process up to 4 whole blood units into 4 RBC 
units, 4 leukoreduced plasma units, and 4 interim platelet units (IPU). The CPD/AS -[ADDRESS_209905] is leukoreduced and may be stored up to 42 days.  
Intended Use:  Intended Use of the Reveos Device  The Reveos  device is intended to automatically separate units of whole blood into blood 
components.  
Intended Use and Description of the Reveos Blood Bag Set  
The Reveos Blood Bag Set is intended to collect a unit of whole blood and to process the 
unit on the Reveos  device, producing blood components.  
Intended Use of the Reveos System Manager  Software   
The Reveos System Manager is a software application that manages Reveos procedures and processing data.   
Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the LR -RBCs derived from 
whole blood and  processed with the Reveos System meet FDA criteria for 24 -hour 
recovery  after 42 -day storage.  
Primary Endpoint:  The primary endpoint is the 24- hour in vivo RBC recovery  after 42 -day storage .

Clinical Investigation Plan: CTS- 5085  Version 3.0: 11 March 2022  
Confidential  Page 5 of 52 Study Design:  This is a prospective, open- label, multicenter study to evaluate whole blood derived red 
blood cells  processed using the  Reveos System.    
The main objective is autologous in- vivo recovery of radiolabeled  leukoreduced R BCs 
derived from whole blood processed using the Reveos System and stored for 42 days.    
DAY -14- 0    
Screening for all participants.       
DAY 0   
One (1) unit of whole blood (500mL  +/- 10%) will be collected, and the whole blo od unit 
will be processed with the Reveos System within 8 hours. The whole blood will be 
separated into three blood components: red blood cells , plasma and platelets.  RBCs will 
be leukoreduced with red blood cell (RBC) leukoreduction filter integrated int o the 
Reveos Blood Bag Set .   
RBC mass recovery and leukoreduction post filtration will be measured.  
LR-RBC units  will be stored at 1 -6°C for 42 days. Plasma and platelet products will be 
discarded per site policy.     
DAY 42:       
Stored RBCs will be tested for hemolysis, in addition visual inspection and /or bacterial 
testing, and donor viral screens will be confirmed negative .   
Radiolabeling: An aliquot of 42-day stored autologous LR -RBC s will be radiolabeled 
with chromium -51 (51Cr).  An  aliquot of freshly collected and prepared RBC s will be 
radiolabeled with technetium -99m (99mTc). The labeled aliquots will then be combined 
and infused to the autologous donor. Blood samples will be collected approximately at 5, 
7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 20, and [ADDRESS_209906] infusion.    
DAY 43:    
Blood sample for 24- hour RBC recovery will be drawn. This visit concludes the study.

over 12 million WB and apheresis red blood cell (RBC) units were collected in the US and 
approximately 85% of these units were WB collections.3 Patients may receive a unit of WB or 
individual blood components to treat any particular condition and the Global Database on Blood 
Safety reports that in high income countries 97% of WB donations are processed into blood 
components.[ADDRESS_209916] fully 
automated system for WB unit processing developed by [CONTACT_178608] (BK080010), which could process one unit of WB into blood components in one 
run.6 
The Reveos S ystem can process up to four (4) WB units in one run. It combines balancing, 
centrifugation, component separation, and sealing into one platform.  
As an automated blood processor, the Reveos  System  is beneficial in reducing  manual blood 
processing drawbacks including processing time , and variability in the procedures and end 
product leading to standardized blood component yield and quality.  
The aim of this study is  to evaluate the in -vivo 24-hour recovery of autologous RBCs produced 
with the Reveos System and stored for 42 days, in order to meet the FDA ’s criteria for 
manufactured RBCs.

The Reveos  System consists of the Reveos  device (processing equipment) that uses centrifugal 
force to separate WB  into its  components, a disposable Reveos blood bag set intended to collect 
and store separated components, and a software program to manage the operations.  
Reveos D evice  
The Reveos S ystem ( Figure 3-1) is an easy -to-use platform that automates and integrates the 
manual steps involved in WB processing. The system processes up to 4 units of WB to produce RBCs, leukoreduced plasma, platelets, and residual leukocytes with a single centrifugation step. The Reveos S ystem ( Figure 3-2) consists of a computer-controlled centrifuge equipped with a 
rotor with 4 fixed buckets, in which the Reveos blood bag set can be placed. Each bucket 
contains a hydraulic-driven expressor to press the different fractions of the centrifuged blood 
from the top to the satellite bags.

12.3 Participant Enrollment  
A donor is considered an enrolled participant upon giving informed consent for study 
participation; this timepoint represents the beginning of a participant’s involvement in the s tudy. 
After informed consent has been obtained, participants will receive a unique s ubject  
identification number (USID) to de-identify participants. The USID number will use the 
following convention: XX- YYY , where XX is the pre -assigned site number and YYY will be a 
sequential number starting with 001. The USID  number will be recorded on the Case Report 
Form (CRF). Participant  identifiers such as initials or names will not be used, for example: 
First participant  enrolled at Site #01: John Doe  = [ADDRESS_209925] participant  enrolled at Site #02: Jane Doe = 02 -001 
It is expected that some proportion of enrolled participants will not qualify for study inclusion 
per the screening and eligibility criteria, and some who are deemed eligible will not initiate the WB collection procedure. Participants will be considered study procedure discontinuations or 
study terminations if, following initiation of the WB collection, they do not complete the study procedures, as applicable and as described further in Section 13. 
13 STUDY PROCEDURES  
The study procedures are to be performed following the WB collection day (Day 0), and are 
therefore referenced as days post WB collection (e.g. the reinfusion of autologous LR- RBC will  
take place 42 days after the WB collection day) .  A study procedure schedule of events is

Clinical Investigation Plan: CTS- 5085  Version 3.0: [ADDRESS_209937] inadvertently entered the blood bag 
collection system. The stored LR- RBCs will undergo bacterial testing and/or visual inspection, 
per site’s SOP . The results from this testing  or inspection will be reviewed  prior to the infusion of 
cells. Any participant with positive results will not be re -infused with their RBC. Total volume of 
blood drawn from subjects completing the study will be approximately [ADDRESS_209938] single unit WB collection (211 ml of RBC loss) is between 450-550 mL. After a 
WB collection the body replaces the plasma in about 24 hours, RBCs  are restored in two to four 
weeks, and platelets are replenished in about 72 hours.   
16.2 Risk Mitigation  
The Reveos Blood Bag Sets are manufactured according to good manufacturing practices (GMP) 
and are sterile . The systems instructional labeling  will be provided for the disposables blood bag 
sets and the hardware/software and the site will be trained for correct use of the system. Site 
SOPs  will be used for technical aspects of blood collection. 
Risks for the subject can be minimized by:  
• Ensuring that all Investigators are properly qualified and meet pre- specified criteria for 
Investigator selection and that they and their study teams successfully complete the 
following training: s ite-specific training, Human Subject Protection, Good Clini cal 
Practice (GCP), and CIP training to include device and procedure training.  
• Ensuring that participants  who are enrolled meet all eligibility criteria   
• Ensuring universal precautions are used for handling all study blood products in accordance with each  site’s SOPs.  
• With the collection of health data associated with this research study, there is a small risk 
of violation of privacy and loss of confidentiality. T he source data and CRFs  will only  
use de- identified subject USID  number as participant  identif iers, to ensure confidentiality. 
• Participants  will be monitored for adverse experiences throughout the study. Suspected 
adverse events  will be treated according to study sites’ SOPs and documented as 
described in Section 16.[ADDRESS_209939]. Real benefits are altruistic in nature: subjects 
participating in this study will assist in gathering important information for safety and 
performance, to assess The Reveos® Automated Blood Processing System (Reveos S ystem)  to 
obtain required regulatory clearance for future use in the [LOCATION_003].

investigational devices.  This includes all investigational devices received, used, or returned, and includes those that malfunctioned and/or were discarded for any reason. Device accountability 
logs supplied by [CONTACT_178620]. The disposition 
of all devices must be documented, including those that have been discarded and those returned to the sponsor.  During the course of the study, device accountability logs will be monitored on a regular basis. When the enrollment phase of the study is complete, the investigator will return to 
the sponsor any unused devices and a copy of the completed device accountability logs. Any use 
of a device outside of this study protocol is strictly forbidden and will constitute immediate grounds for removal of the investigator and/or institution from the study. 
All investigational devices that are not used must be returned to the sponsor.  
These devices may include the following:  
• All unused investigational devices when enrollment is complete.  
• All expi[INVESTIGATOR_178599].  
• All investigational devices associated with a device malfunction or failure.  
• All opened but unused devices that may be contaminated, have a defect in the sterile 
barrier prior to use, or have some other potential defect identified.

Asymptotic confidence limits will be presented based on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution for the proportion of subjects classified as a treatment success. Exact confidence intervals will be used for all other presentations. Continuous demographic parameters, such as 
the subject’s age at the time of enrollment, will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum value, and 95% 2- sided confidence 
limits).

from reinfusion where the sample was not properly prepared could dampen the results and 
significantly contribute to the variability and challenge the normality of the distribution of values used for calculating the average recovery values. 
The following general conventions will be applied to all data presentations and analyses. 
• Summary statistics will consist of the number and percentage of responses in each level 
for categorical variables, and the sample size (n), mean, median, standard deviation (SD), range, and 95% 2-sided confidence limits for continuous variables. 
• All mean and median values will be formatted to one more decimal place than the 
measured value.  Standard deviation values will be formatted to two more decimal places 
than the measured value.  Minimum and maximum values will be presented with the same number of decimal places as the measured value.  
• The number and percentage of responses will be presented in the form XX (XX %) where 
the percentage is in the parentheses.  
• All summary tables will include the analysis population sample size (i.e., number of 
subjects enrolled in the study).

the primary endpoints are not evaluable (i.e., those subjects who are lost- to-follow-up or 
withdrawn ; those subjects whose health status has changed prior to their reinfusion, thereby

It is anticipated that up to 50 donors may need to be enrolled to accrue 24 evaluable subjects to 
the primary endpoint analysis. All subjects, regardless of the availability of their endpoint da ta, 
will be included in evaluations of In  vitro data (where samples are available) and in evaluations 
of AEs.  
Sample Size Estimates for LR -RBC Evaluation  
The 3 parts of FDA’s RBC recovery criteria that must be met are presented below.  The derivation of the sample size was based on the level of precision attained with [ADDRESS_209949] part of the criteria.  
1. The one-sided 95% lower confidence limit for the population proportion of success is greater 
than 70% where success of a unit is defined as the RBC in vivo 24-hour percentage recovery ≥ 75% *,  
2. The sample mean of percent recovery ≥ 75%, and  
3. The sample standard deviation of in vivo 24-hour R BC recovery ≤ 9%.  
*
Allows for low recoveries (<75%) in 2/20 or 3/[ADDRESS_209950] criterion (i) with 24 subjects, examining the one-sided 
lower 95% confidence limit relative to the a priori value of 70%. Results are presented in the table presented below. If the observed proportion of treatment successes is 21/24 (87.50%) or higher, the one-sided lower 95% binomial confidence interval will exceed 70% (lower 
confidence limit = 70.77%).

19.2.1 Primary Endpoint  
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted using the evaluable population. 
Evaluable population is defined in section 19.3.3. 
In vivo RBC viability has been assessed for decades  using radiolabeled autologous RBCs to 
assess the proportion of RBCs remaining in the circulation 24 hours after autologous infusion 
(24-hr RBC recovery). Radiolabeling methods and reporting of recovery have been standardized 
8,9,[ADDRESS_209951] infusion requires that RBC mass be accurately measured. This can be 
performed by [CONTACT_178622].  
Additional exploratory analyses may be performed on estimates of RBC recovery using RBC 
mass derived from 99mTc radiolabeling. 
RBC recovery 24 hours after infusion will be reported using the single label method 
recommended by [CONTACT_178623].9 The 51Cr value at time = 0 (T zero, T0) is obtained by [CONTACT_7087] a 
regression analysis of the values obtained for 51Cr labeled samples drawn at different time-points 
post-infusion. The T0 is used to calculate the percent recovery at 24 hours. The calculated T0 may be falsely low if the labeled RBCs are removed by [CONTACT_178624] -endothelial (RE) system in 
large numbers prior to the first blood being drawn at [ADDRESS_209952] injection. This would result in a falsely higher 24-hour recovery. Recovery at 24 hours will be calculated using the following 
equation:  
 % recovery = (Adjusted RBC CPM at 24 hours/ Adjusted RBC CPM at time 0) x [ADDRESS_209953]-infusion. The counts will be 
adjusted for background counts and corrected for loss of label (elution) over time.
[ADDRESS_209954]-infusion will be used to assess each of 
the three criteria specified by [CONTACT_8415]. The % recovery for analysis will be provided by [CONTACT_779](s), and not derived during analysis. To assess the criteria associated with the percent of samples with at least a 75% recovery, a success or failure for each observed value will be determined. RBC recovery of at least 75% will be deemed a success, and failure otherwise.  A one-sided 
confidence interval for the proportion of successes will be determined using an exact 95% 
confidence interval.  If the one-sided 95% lower confidence limit is greater than 70% the study will have met its primary e ndpoint, which will be met if no more than 3/[ADDRESS_209955] less 
than 75% recovery. 
Summary statistics and 2- sided confidence intervals will be presented to assess the actual RBC 
recovery values and to evaluate the remaining criteria specified by [CONTACT_8415].

1.Statement  of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested. 
The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerability and short-term efficacy of a single 
ketamine infusion for the treatment of adolescents with 1) medication-refractory major 
depressive disorder (MDD) and/or 2) medication-refractory anxiety disorders (social anxiety 
disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and/or separation anxiety disorder). We 
will conduct a crossover trial in which as many as 36 adolescents (18 with MDD and 18 with 
anxiety disorders) will be given a single infusion of ketamine (study drug) or midazolam (active 
control).  MDD symptoms and anxiety symptoms will be monitored over a two-week period.  If 
applicable, comorbid school refusal symptoms will also be monitored over a two-week period for 
both cohorts.  A 2-week washout period will be required between infusion doses.  Our primary 
outcomes will be 1) improvement in MDD symptoms (measured by [CONTACT_759880]-Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale, revised (MADRS) score) 1 day after infusion, for the cohort of subjects 
enrolled in the MDD arm of this trial and 2) improvement in the anxiety symptoms (measured by 
[CONTACT_912620] (MASC) acute physical symptoms subscale) for the 
cohort of subjects enrolled in the anxiety disorders arm of the trial.  As secondary outcomes, w e 
are also proposing to (1) more comprehensively  assess suicidal  ideation as an additional  
efficacy  outcome  in the trial, (2) measure  ketamine’s effects on symptom  constructs associated 
with suicidal  ideation or behavior, including anxiety, anhedonia and hopelessness (3-8), (3) 
examine ketamine’s effects on school-refusal behavior (SRB) that is associated with anxiety 
and depression and (4) examine  ketamine’s effects on frontal  neural systems associated with 
suicidal  ideation and behavior as well as anxiety using functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) and a behavioral  task that  has previously  demonstrated findings associated with 
suicide  attempts in adolescents with mood disorders (9).
2.   Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide
      references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data. 
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):
      MDD is a significant pediatric health problem with a point prevalence of up to 8% and a 
lifetime prevalence approaching 25% by [CONTACT_912621] (10-13). Adolescent MDD is 
associated with significant comorbidity including poor social and scholastic functioning, early 
pregnancy, and increased risk of physical illness and substance abuse (14-16). It is also linked 
with significant mortality, with an increased risk for suicide (the 3rd leading cause of death in 15-
24 year olds) (10, 17). Treatment can be difficult, with 40% of patients failing to achieve 
remission from SSRIs (18). Of that SSRI-resistant population, nearly half remain depressed 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_912565] (19, 20). Of those that do improve, 1 in 
4 relapse within a year (21). 
Anxiety Disorders:
Pediatric anxiety disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, 
separation anxiety disorder and panic disorder) are some of the most prevalent psychiatric 
conditions in children and adolescents(22, 23).  It is estimated that 15–20% of youth suffer from 
these disorders(22, 23). When not treated successfully, anxiety disorders are associated with 
significant short- and long-term impairment and tremendous societal costs (24-26).  Childhood 
anxiety disorders are often precursors to additional subsequent anxiety disorders, major 
depression, substance abuse and suicide attempts (27, 28).  Cognitive-behavior therapy and

Page [ADDRESS_1282174] effective treatments for 
pediatric anxiety disorders.  The Childhood Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS) demonstrated 
that both CBT and SSRIs were highly effective for childhood anxiety disorders and their 
combination was superior to each individual therapy (29).  However, it is estimated that roughly 
have of children with anxiety disorders fail to achieve remission with available first-line 
treatment (30).   Severe anxiety in childhood is associated with increased risk of depression, 
school refusal, substance abuse, suicide and reduced quality of life (31).   Although first-line 
treatments are quite effective in pediatric anxiety additional treatments to benefit those children 
and adolescents who fail to benefit from these first-line treatments are urgently needed as other 
evidence-based treatment options are lacking.
Ketamine
       Evidence implicates the glutamate system in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety. 
Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, has been demonstrated in multiple controlled clinical 
studies to have rapi[INVESTIGATOR_912566], anti-anxiety and anti-suicidal effects (32-37) (see 
preliminary data section). In adult studies, ketamine has a robust average effect size of >1.2 and 
an number needed to treat (NNT) of only 2.3 in the medication-refractory depressed population 
(1). While ketamine improves a range of depressive symptoms in adults, it notably reduces 
anhedonia (38), a symptom associated with poor therapeutic response in adolescent MDD (39). 
Ketamine also specifically reduces suicidality in adults (40), a dimension of adolescent MDD 
that is resistant to, or perhaps even increased, by [CONTACT_912622] (41, 42). Similarly, several controlled 
studies in adults have suggested ketamine may be effective in reducing OCD and PTSD 
symptoms as well as comorbid anxiety symptoms in subjects with primary MDD.  While the 
glutamate system continues to mature in adolescence (43), preclinical data suggests that 
ketamine reverses depressive phenotypes in adolescent rats (44). Due to its success in treating 
adult MDD, ketamine has started to be used for treatment-refractory affective disorders in 
adolescence in the community (45), despi[INVESTIGATOR_912567].  Similarly, we know of no controlled trials examining the effects of ketamine on 
anxiety disorders in children or adolescents. 
We propose to conduct a study to explore the efficacy and time course of action of 
intravenous ketamine in the treatment of adolescent treatment-refractory 1) MDD and/or 2) 
anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and 
separation anxiety)  
Secondary Outcomes
As secondary outcomes we will examine the effects of ketamine on (1) suicidal ideation 
and related constructs associated with suicidal behavior; (2) frontal systems involved in 
emotional face processing using fMRI that have been associated with depression, suicidal 
behavior and anxiety and (3) school refusal behaviors.
Suicidal Ideation and Related Constructs
We are proposing a more thorough assessment of ketamine’s effect on suicidal ideation 
and related constructs in order to provide data on whether ketamine has similar anti-suicidal 
properties in adolescents as has been demonstrated in adults. Throughout the trial we will 
regularly monitor the subjects. We will also examine ketamine’s effects on biological markers of 
depressive, anxiety and suicidal behavior on neurocognitive testing.  Specifically, we will 
examine ketamine’s effects (compared to midazolam) in the both cohorts 24-hours after infusion 
on at least three neuropsychological tasks (46) (47); (1) Depression Implicit Association Tasks,

self on the Death/Suicide IAT has been associated with not only previous history of suicide 
attempts but also future attempts.  
Emotional Face Processing on fMRI
To investigate the brain changes that underlie ketamine’s effects, we also propose to 
examine the effects of ketamine on responses within a frontal system during performance of an 
implicit emotional face processing task. Previous fMRI research using emotional face processing 
tasks has shown that it is affected by [CONTACT_912623]-depressed adolescents and depressed adolescents with and without past 
suicide attempt history (9, 49-52). Emotional face processing tasks have also been demonstrated 
to be affected by [CONTACT_912624] (53-55).
School Refusal Behavior (SRB):
MDD and anxiety are commonly associated with comorbid school refusal behavior. Nearly 5 
to 10% of school aged children and adolescents have excessive SRB (56, 57).  Long-term 
consequences of SRB include increased risk of substance abuse, suicide attempt, risky sexual 
behavior, and school dropout (58-60). Furthermore, SRB has high societal cost in the billions 
with proximal costs associated with poor academic performance or attendance, future 
underemployment and increased risk of criminal prosecution (60). Once refusal of school begins, 
children tend to continue this behavior, and returning youth to school becomes extremely 
challenging for children, parents, schools, and clinicians.  
Although the population of children and adolescents with prolonged SRB is heterogeneous, 
up to 50% of these youth have comorbid anxiety and depression (61-63).  Children with SRB 
and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms tend to refuse school primarily to avoid school-
related stimuli that provoke a sense of general negative affectivity and/or to escape from aversive 
social or evaluative situations at school (64, 65).  The longer the avoidance of school-related 
stimuli persists, the more difficult SRB become to treat and the greater the psychiatric, social and 
academic consequences.  The SRB intervention literature is limited. A recent review of 
psychosocial interventions, predominantly cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for SRB, identified 
only 8 small randomized controlled and quasi-experimental trials involving 435 participants.  
Results from this meta-analysis demonstrated that psychosocial interventions significantly 
increased attendance but did not significantly decrease anxiety in SRB (66).  Other studies have 
examined medications including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (67-70), serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (71) (72, 73), and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (72), for SRB school refusal behavior in children 
and have reported inconsistent effects. Other than imipramine no medication, has shown 
significant benefit for school refusal in any randomized, controlled trial (67-70).  Even when 
beneficial, antidepressant medications (e.g. TCAs, SSRIs) even when beneficial, take several 
weeks to reach full effects in improving anxiety and depression. 
PRELIMINARY DATA: 
Ketamine is an FDA-approved anesthetic agent that is commonly used to induce surgical 
anesthesia due to its low incidence of significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_912568]. Its 
anesthetic effects are thought to be directly related to non-competitive inhibition of NMDA 
receptors. The majority of NMDA receptors in the forebrain consist of heterotetramers of the 
subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B; these subunits combine to form a cation channel, permeable to 
both sodium and calcium, that is dually gated by [CONTACT_912625]. Ketamine binds non- 
selectively to all common NMDA receptor subtypes at a site within the open channel and thereby

Ketamine has a wide therapeutic window and has been used safely in Pediatrics for over 40 years 
for sedation prior to medical procedures and dentistry (74, 75). Ketamine is in fact used more 
frequently in Pediatrics than in adult populations, typi[INVESTIGATOR_912569] 1mg/kg – 4.5mg/kg iv 
over 60 seconds when used as an anesthetic agent. While there are no prospective studies of 
ketamine in pediatric psychiatric populations, the recently published retrospective report of 
ketamine use in pediatric bipolar depression did not describe any serious safety problems or 
adverse events associated with its use (45). Yale University has been safely using ketamine in 
research studies with adult psychiatric patients for over 20 years (32).
Major Depressive Disorder
A placebo-controlled study completed here at Yale first demonstrated the surprising finding that 
a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg, intravenously) had rapid antidepressant effects in 
depressed patients (33). In these subjects, 
ketamine infusion produced mild 
psychotomimetic symptoms and euphoria that 
dissipated within [ADDRESS_1282175] 180 minutes and persisted 
over 72 hours (33). Fifty percent of depressed 
patients receiving ketamine were treatment 
responders at Day 3 compared to 12.5% in the 
placebo infusion group (33). Another recent 
double-blind study performed at NIMH 
confirmed the rapid antidepressant effects of 
ketamine (34). In this second study, 72% of 
ketamine infused patients responded to 
treatment compared to no treatment responders 
in the placebo group (34).  Since these initial 
studies at Yale, multiple controlled clinical 
studies have demonstrated that ketamine yields 
rapid antidepressant effect in unipolar and 
bipolar depression (33, 34, 76-78) (Figure 1) 
with an average effect size of 1.2 and a number 
needed to treat of only 2.3 (1).  Ketamine’s anti-
depressant effects peak 1-3 days following 
infusion.  Ketamine’s antidepressant effect is 
observed long after ketamine has been 
metabolized and excreted by [CONTACT_912626]’s sedative and dissociative effects have dissipated.  
In order to provide proof of “target engagement” as pi[INVESTIGATOR_49452] a larger, more definitive NIH-
funded clinical trial examining ketamine’s suicide preventive properties, we also plan to examine 
ketamine’s effects on a frontal neural system associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. 
Specifically, abnormalities involving emotional processing neural circuitry are hypothesized to 
be particularly important in the development of adolescent suicidal behavior. Previous structural

and dorsal prefrontal cortex and striatal regions, including responses to positive stimuli that are 
hypothesized to increase anhedonia, and decreases in regions subserving impulse regulation (79). 
The interplay between neural circuits mediating emotional processing and impulsivity is central 
to our working model of adolescent suicidal behavior (79). We will specifically examine 
ketamine’s effects on fMRI measures during an emotion face processing paradigm. Similar 
methods have previously elicited frontal neural system differences between adolescents and 
young adults who have made suicide attempts and who have suicidal ideation, from those 
without (9, 80, 81). Previous fMRI studies demonstrated elevated responses to faces depi[INVESTIGATOR_912570], anterior cingulate and 
insular cortices and amygdala, and hypoactivation to happy faces within dorsal and rostral 
prefrontal cortex and striatal regions (50-52). In previous fMRI studies of depressed adolescents, 
the responses to negative emotional stimuli were shown to be higher in those with a previous 
history of suicide attempts than those without (9). A previous open-trial of 20 adults with 
treatment-refractory depression demonstrated normalization of blunted neural responses to happy 
faces 24-hours after ketamine infusion in subjects whose depressive symptoms responded to 
ketamine (49). With the current proposal, we plan to extend upon this previous work by 
[CONTACT_912627].
Due to its success in treating adult MDD and suicidal ideation, ketamine is now in use for 
treatment-refractory adolescents (45), despi[INVESTIGATOR_912571]. Thus, carefully monitored prospective studies measuring ketamine’s effects 
on suicidal ideation and constructs associated with suicide attempts, such as anxiety, anhedonia, 
hopelessness and depression, are urgently needed.
Anxiety Disorders
Strong evidence also implicates the glutamate system in the pathophysiology of anxiety (82-86).  
The results of several clinical studies suggest that ketamine may also have significant anxiolytic 
effects in addition to antidepressant effects.  As discussed earlier, ketamine has a robust average 
effect size of >1.2 in reducing depressive symptoms and an NNT of only 2.3 in the medication 
refractory adults with major depressive disorder (90). Randomized controlled trials of ketamine 
for depressed adult patients demonstrated a significant reduction in comorbid anxiety symptoms, 
with a similar effect size of 1.4 (91, 92). Moderator studies in adults with depression have also 
demonstrated that adults with an anxious depression sub-type have an increased initial response 
to ketamine and longer time to relapse (93, 94).  Adults with anxious depression relapsed 
significantly later than those with non-anxious depression (median ± SE = 19.0 ± 17.9 vs 1.0 ± 
0.0 days to relapse, respectively; χ² = 9.30; P = .002) (93, 94).  Ketamine has also been shown to 
reduce anxiety in adult patients with PTSD (95, 96) and OCD (97, 98). We also have recently 
completed a randomized, saline-controlled crossover study of ketamine in 18 adults with social 
anxiety disorder.  Ketamine demonstrated a significant reduction in the CGI-I score at 1 day 
following infusion compared to saline (paired t-test t=2.78, p=0.015). Eleven of 18 subjects 
receiving ketamine were rated as minimally improved or better on the CGI 1-day following 
infusion compared to 2 of 17 receiving saline.

language that can be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish 
between standard of care vs. research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of 
visits specifying their individual times and lengths. Describe the setting in which the research 
will take place.
Overview:
This is a double-blind, active control crossover study of 36 adolescents (13-17 years old) 
with treatment-refractory 1)  MDD and/or 2) anxiety (social anxiety disorder, generalized 
anxiety disorder, panic disorder and/or separation anxiety disorder). Subjects will be assigned to 
the MDD treatment arm and/or the anxiety disorder treatment arm based on whether they meet 
inclusion criteria for each treatment arm (or both treatment arms).  Subjects will receive similar 
symptom ratings regardless of which treatment arm(s) they are assigned.    
Each subject will receive one infusion of ketamine (the study drug) and one infusion of 
midazolam (an active control agent). Due to the difficulty in blinding ketamine’s acute effects 
and the high rate of placebo responses in depression and anxiety research, use of an active 
control is considered essential in establishing efficacy. There will be a 2-week period in between 
infusions in order to balance a potentially acceptable washout period with the risks of forbidding 
medication changes during the protocol. As shown in figure 1A, in adults, the antidepressant 
effects of ketamine typi[INVESTIGATOR_912572] 7 days, and thus a 2-week period in between infusions is 
expected to be adequate. The study investigators, subjects, their parents, and research staff will 
be blinded to the infusion order. Infusion order will be determined by [CONTACT_750418], assigned in a balanced manner, and kept strictly confidential until the time of 
unblinding. Following each infusion, plasma ketamine metabolites and D-serine levels will be 
measured at 4 time points (last at [ADDRESS_1282177]-infusion) and the participant’s 1) MDD 
and/or 2) anxiety symptoms will be assessed for 2 weeks.  Comorbid SRB (if applicable) will 
also be assessed for two weeks for participants in each of the cohorts.  These psychiatric 
assessments will be conducted by a rater unaware of the clinical and side effect ratings on 
infusion day. Additionally, a separate rater will conduct side effect and psychotomimetic ratings 
for ketamine and midazolam throughout the study in order to reduce the risk of unblinding due to 
the psychometric and physiologic side effects associated with ketamine. 
In addition, we will be performing [CONTACT_912656]’s paradigm for fMRI at baseline (before 
the first infusion) and 24 hours after each infusion to examine ketamine’s effect on the frontal 
system during an emotional face processing task. 
Screening/Baseline (Visit 1):
After an initial phone screen to rule out any clear exclusion from the study protocol, 
potential subjects will be scheduled for a screening visit at the Yale Child Study Center. At the 
screening visit, a member of our research team will discuss all aspects of the study: its purpose, 
the procedures that will be performed, any/all risks of the procedures, possible benefits, and 
possible alternative treatments. If the patient is considered eligible for the study and agrees to 
enroll, the patient and his/her parent/guardian will be asked to sign the assent and parental 
permission forms, respectively. Once consented, the participant will undergo a standard clinical 
evaluation consisting of psychiatric history, physical, laboratory and mental status exams with 
one of the study doctors.  This assessment includes collection of detailed information about all 
prior psychiatric therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including dose, duration of treatment, side effects, and partial 
efficacy. The participant and his/her parent/guardian will also receive a clinical diagnostic 
interview using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents

Page 17 of 59(MINI-KID) (99).  Additionally, the participant and his/her parent/guardian will complete 
clinical ratings related to the participant’s 1) MDD symptoms and/or anxiety symptoms 2) 
symptoms of other commonly comorbid psychiatric conditions including school refusal 
behaviors. A medical assessment including vital signs, physical exam, baseline serum labs, urine 
drug screen, and urine pregnancy test will be completed prior to enrollment. The clinical 
assessment will take approximately 2 hours and the imaging will take about 1 hour and a half.
Assessments and Ratings (Table 1 provides a detailed assessment schedule)
a. Medical Assessments: Vital signs, physical exam, and clinical laboratory tests (i.e. 
CBC with differential, complete metabolic panel (CMP) (including electrolytes, LFTs, BUN, 
creatinine and glucose), TFTs, and routine urinalysis) will be completed. A total of 30 cc of 
blood will be drawn via venipuncture at this visit. In addition, an EKG will be performed and 
read in order to rule out any cardiac abnormalities. 
Female subjects of childbearing potential will require urine/serum pregnancy testing prior to 
enrollment in the protocol. Because full confidentiality regarding pregnancy cannot be entirely 
guaranteed, these testing requirements and the limited scope of confidentiality will be made 
known to all subjects during the consent procedure. In this manner, young women who would 
not be comfortable with pregnancy testing or sharing the results of such testing can “opt out” of 
the study at the time of the initial consent, without having to declare specific reasons. According 
to CT state statutes for mandatory reporting, pregnancy in females less than age of 13 years, 
will be reported to parent(s) and to the State of Connecticut Department of Children and Family 
Services (DCF). Confidentiality with regard to pregnancy test results will be maintained for 
females > [ADDRESS_1282178] will need to be asked 
questions about his/her prior and/or current illicit drug use and undergo drug testing (urine). 
Because drug use will exclude the minor from participating, the parent may ask why the child 
was asked not to participate or to leave the study. Therefore, parents and/or minors who are 
uncomfortable with questions about drug use can "opt out" of the study at the time of initial 
consent, without having to declare specific reasons. 
Drug use information (in the adolescent > 13 years of age) will not be shared with parents 
unless the study team feels that the minor is exhibiting behaviors that would pose an immediate 
threat to the minor or to others. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768]-investigator will ask the minor if the study team can 
share the drug testing results with parents. If the minor declines, the study team will refer the 
minor for evaluation based upon the clinical judgment of the Principal Investigator. In all cases, 
the safety and well-being of the minor will be protected. We will explicitly inform parents and 
minors, in the permission and assent documents, and orally with regard to these guidelines. 
b. Psychiatric  Assessments: Ratings will be conducted by [CONTACT_7628]. A detailed
description of the most common assessments included but not limited to, is listed below. The

30 faces/run, 4 runs. Stimulus order is varied to control for sequential dependencies and 
counterbalanced within and across runs for expression, sex, identity and interstimulus interval.
Neuropsychological Testing: Subjects will perform various neuropsychological tests (46).  
Subjects will perform four tests, (1) Suicide Implicit Association Tasks, (2) Depression Implicit 
Association Tasks, and (3) Self Injurious Implicit Association Tasks and (4) the Anxiety 
Implicit Association Task.  These tests will be administered first at Baseline, 24 hours after each 
infusion, and Day 7 and 14 after each infusion.  The IAT are brief computer-administered tests 
that use people’s reaction times when classifying semantic stimuli to measure the automatic 
mental associations they hold about various topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], in this case, life and death/suicide (48) (47).
Infusion (Visit 2 &10 – Day 0 & Day 14): Subjects who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_110407], are eligible to continue with the protocol procedures (after the results of the 
screening/baseline measures and diagnostics are considered) will present to the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341244] (2) at Yale New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (YNHH) for the first infusion. The participant 
will be instructed to follow American Society of Anesthesiologists NPO guidelines the night 
before the infusion. These guidelines allow milk or a light meal 6 hours prior to the procedure 
and clear liquids up to 2 hours prior to the procedure. One hour prior to the infusion, two IV’s 
will be placed and the patient will complete a screening interview with the Conscious Sedation 
physician. The participant’s vital signs will be taken and they will receive a physical exam, EKG, 
rapid urine drug screen, and urine pregnancy test (if applicable). They will additionally complete 
a series of clinical ratings (see Table 1). 5cc of blood will be collected off of the non-infusion IV 
to measure pre-infusion ketamine metabolites and D-serine levels. One hour later, the infusion 
will be administered over a 40-minute period, either ketamine at a dose of 0.5mg/kg, or 
midazolam at a dose of 0.045 mg/kg (doses of both medications not to exceed a maximum total 
dose corresponding to a weight of 100kg). Ketamine and midazolam administrations will be 
performed on the HRU in the presence of a physician from the Pediatric Sedation Service, with 
access to airway and rescue equipment. The participant’s vital signs will be monitored every 
hour for three hours following the infusion. 5cc blood collections off of the non-infusion iv will 
take place at 40 minutes (end of the infusion), [ADDRESS_1282181] will be present at all times during 
the procedure and recovery. This visit will take approximately 7-8 hours because the participant 
will receive the infusion as well as assessments and blood collection before and after the 
infusion. The total amount of blood collected on the infusion day will be 35cc (ranging from 
0.77cc/kg for a 45kg adolescent (average weight of a 13-year-old girl or boy) to 0.53cc/kg 
(average weight of a 17-year-old boy)), all collected from the non-infusion IV to minimize 
discomfort. Fourteen days will separate the first and second infusions. 
Ketamine has been used safely in pediatrics for over 40 years for conscious sedation and 
dentistry (75), however it does have significant risks.  The most common side effects when 
ketamine is infused at the current rate and dose in adult studies are (1) increased blood pressure,

Page 20 of 59respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse, (2) pain/rash at the injection site, (3) temporary psychiatric symptoms 
including,
 but not limited to, disorientation, anxiety, dysphoria, flashbacks, hallucinations, and 
psychotic-like symptoms (which occur less frequently in younger patients (75)). These reactions 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_115216]-limited and occur in ~12% of adults given higher doses of ketamine than 
proposed in this study (116). The most serious side effects are (1) increased intraocular pressure, 
(2) allergic reaction, (3) laryngospasm, (4) elevated blood pressure resulting in stroke, heart 
attack, or death, and (5) substance abuse, all of which are rare (74, 75). These risks will be 
mitigated by [CONTACT_912628] [ADDRESS_1282182] 20 years. The Yale Pediatric Sedation Service uses ketamine in children and adolescents 
on a daily basis. This dose of ketamine is considered subanesthetic in both adults and children 
(74), and thus we expect minimal cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_912574]. Case report level 
data suggests a favorable side effect profile for intranasal ketamine for adolescents with 
refractory disorders (45). However, if side effects do not dissipate we will additionally offer 
patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912575], Adolescent Unit for psychiatric side effects 
or YNHH for medical side effects. 
Midazolam, the active control in this study, similarly has a robust history of use in pediatric 
sedation and dentistry (117-123). Also similar to ketamine, the dose proposed in the current 
study (0.045mg/kg over 40 minutes) is lower and slower than doses used in most pediatric 
sedation procedures (0.05 – 0.1mg/kg over 2 minutes)(122, 124). The most common side effects 
related to midazolam infusions are hiccups, nausea, vomiting, coughing, headache, and 
drowsiness. In doses higher than those involved in the proposed study, serious cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_912576], including respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826], airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respi[INVESTIGATOR_130276]/or cardiac 
arrest. In younger children, these higher doses have been associated with a risk for paradoxical 
disinhibition. Midazolam, like ketamine, has a short half-life, and important adverse events 
related either drug are not observed after 30 minutes following drug administration (74). The 
Yale Pediatric Sedation team has vast experience with this medication given its common usage, 
and will be present during the infusion and until the patient has reached an appropriate state of 
recovery. While the risks of serious adverse cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_912577], airway equipment and qualified physician personnel will be readily 
available. 
Midazolam is the most appropriate control for ketamine in the proposed study, as the 
psychotomimetic effects of ketamine make it extremely difficult to blind when compared to 
saline (1). Specifically, the typi[INVESTIGATOR_912578], nausea and dissociative effects on ketamine 
functionally un-blind subjects and investigators.  As such, more recent ketamine studies have 
used midazolam as a control.  Using an appropriate active control in this efficacy trial is critical 
to establishing genuine clinical efficacy for ketamine (and not just treatment expectancy or 
subject performance bias) before designing a larger trial, exposing more adolescents to this novel 
therapeutic intervention. 
Outpatient Follow-up: In-person (Visits 3, 7, 9 & 11, 15, 17 – Days 1, 7, 14 & 15, 21, 28)

member. Additionally, on Day 1 and 15 (visit 3 and 11), the psychotomimetic side effects of 
ketamine will be assessed; this assessment will be conducted by a separate rater than the clinical 
ratings.  Imaging will be done and neuropsychological batteries will be applied (see Table 1) 
which will add about 1 to 2 more hour to those assessment days. All of the outpatient study 
follow-up visits will take approximately 1-2 hours.
Outpatient Follow-up: Telephone (Visits 4-6, 8 & 12-14, 16 – Days 2, 3, 5, 10 & 16, 17, 19, 
24)
Each subject will schedule follow-up  telephone calls with a member of the research staff to 
monitor his/her MDD symptoms and anxiety symptoms along with his/her comorbid school 
refusal symptoms (if applicable).  During these telephone calls, participants will complete a 
series of clinical ratings (see Table 1) conducted by a trained research staff member. These 
telephone calls will take approximately 1 hour.
Discharge from the Study: In the event that a subject is judged to remain significantly 
depressed, anxious, presents with worsening school refusal behavior and/or is at an increased 
risk for suicidality at the end of the study, we will help make appropriate referrals to outpatient 
providers, intensive outpatient programs or inpatient psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912579].  
Investigators may continue close monitoring of significantly at risk subjects until such referrals 
are provided and available to the study participant. Participants who have completed the trial 
must have a CDRS score of less than 50 to be discharged from the study.

Page [ADDRESS_1282184]  Classification: Check off all classifications of subjects that will be targeted for 
enrollment in the research project.  Will subjects who may require additional safeguards 
or other considerations be enrolled in the study? If so, identify the population of subjects 
requiring special safeguards and provide a justification for their involvement.
 Children  Healthy Fetal material, placenta, or dead fetus
 Non-English Speaking  Prisoners  Economically disadvantaged persons
 Decisionally Impaired  Employees  Pregnant women and/or fetuses
 Yale Students Females of childbearing potential
NOTE: Is this research proposal designed to enroll children who are wards of the state as 
potential subjects?  Yes   No (If yes, see HIC Application Instructions section VII #2 for 
further requirements)
For adolescents, we will obtain consent from their parent (legal guardian) before enrolling them 
in the study. We will also require childhood assent for participation. A simple quiz testing the 
understanding of the protocol and important elements of informed consent is in place at the end 
of the consent form. 
For females of child bearing potential we will conduct a urine pregnancy test prior to enrollment 
in the study. If the pregnancy test is positive, we will refer people to appropriate treatment and 
will exclude them from participation in the trial until completion of their pregnancy. For sexually 
active females, we will provide contraceptive counseling and refer them for contraceptive 
treatment if indicated. The acceptable methods of contraception will include oral birth control 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (OTCs), IUD, transdermal preparations, parenteral preparations, barrier contraceptive 
methods (i.e. condoms and diaphragm) and abstinence. As noted above, because full 
confidentiality regarding pregnancy cannot be entirely guaranteed, these testing requirements 
and the limited scope of confidentiality will be made known to all subjects during the consent 
procedure. In this manner, young women who would not be comfortable with pregnancy testing 
or sharing the results of such testing can “opt out” of the study at the time of the initial consent, 
without having to declare specific reasons. Pregnancy testing will be repeated on the day of both 
infusions.

Page 26 of 59member of our research team will discuss all aspects of this research: its purpose, the procedures 
that will be performed, any/all risks of the procedures, possible benefits, and possible alternative 
treatments. All patients will also be informed of the standard of care for children with MDD 
and/or anxiety disorders. The standard of care for MDD is initial treatment with an SSRI, which 
may be augmented with the addition of psychotherapy. The standard of care for anxiety disorders 
including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorders, Separation Anxiety Disorder 
and Panic disorder is evidence-based psychotherapy (e.g. CBT) and pharmacologic interventions 
(e.g. SSRI, SNRI, TCA).  The research team will discuss the inclusion and exclusion criteria for 
each arm of the study. To be included in the MDD arm of this study, adolescents must have 1) 
failed their first treatment with an antidepressant medication (e.g. SSRI, SNRI, TCA or other 
accepted FDA-approved medications for MDD and 2) have a diagnosis of MDD by [CONTACT_2681]-5 
criteria and (3) have a CDRS-R score > 40.  To be included in the Anxiety Disorders arm of this 
study, adolescents must have 1) failed pharmacologic  treatment with an antidepressant 
medication  (e.g. SSRI, SNRI, TCA),(2) been offered or failed a trial of CBT for anxiety; (3)

Anxiety Disorder and/or Panic disorder  4) have at least moderately severe anxiety disorders 
symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_912632] ≥4, If they agree to enroll in the study, they will sign the 
consent forms and undergo a standard clinical evaluation consisting of psychiatric history, 
physical, laboratory and mental status exams with one of the study doctors. The participant will 
also receive a clinical diagnostic interview using the MINI-KID, in addition to the baseline rating 
described in Table 1. A medical assessment including vital signs, physical exam, and urine drug 
screen and pregnancy test will be completed prior to enrollment.  
Participants will be enrolled if 1) they have a clinical diagnosis of MDD, meeting DSM-V 
criteria, defined as having at least [ADDRESS_1282187]/pleasure, in 
addition to 4 or more of the following symptoms: change in sleep, loss of interest in daily 
activities, inappropriate guilt, decreased energy, change in concentration, change in appetite, 
psychomotor symptoms, or recurrent thoughts of death and a CDRS-R score > 40 and/or 2) if 
they have clinical diagnosis of the following anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 
Social Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder or Panic disorder). As a secondary 
outcome subjects with severe SRB defined by >25% of absenteeism from school one month 
prior to initiation of study will also be followed if the meet the inclusion criteria with symptoms 
of MDD or Anxiety disorders.
Participants will be excluded from the study if they present with active suicidal ideation, a 
history of serious medical or neurological illness, current psychoactive substance dependence, 
mental disorders due to identified medical conditions, or non-psychotic disorder. Participants 
will also be excluded if they manifest signs of major medical or neurological illness on 
examination or as detected by [CONTACT_145138]. The routine laboratory studies will include a 
CMP (including LFT’s), TFTs, CBC w/ diff, urinalysis, urine toxicology, EKG, and medical 
history, and a urine pregnancy test for females. Care will be taken to exclude pregnant women. 
Female participants will have a serum pregnancy test prior to receiving any treatment or testing 
in the study and will be informed of the importance of not becoming pregnant during the study. 
Participants will be excluded if they are judged to be so clinically unstable that participation in 
the study might represent a significant clinical risk or are unwilling to stay on a stable medication 
regimen for the length of this study.

9. Risks:  Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, 
discomforts, or inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research. 
Ketamine administration: Ketamine is a medication approved by [CONTACT_912634]. It is a dissociative 
anesthetic that has been used in humans since the late 1960's. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_912582]-term toxicity associated with ketamine administration. However, the 
acute behavioral side effects of this medication warrant particular attention. Krystal et al, 
administered ketamine to healthy subjects at the West Haven VAMC(32). The study showed that 
ketamine produces dose-related effects at sub-anesthetic effects in healthy subjects. At 0.1 mg/kg 
administered over 40 minutes, the low dose in the VA protocol, ketamine produced little more 
than a tingling in the extremities and a "little buzzing in the head". At 0.5 mg/kg, the VA study’s 
high dose, and the dose proposed in this protocol, ketamine transiently elicited both the positive 
and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, dissociative symptoms, attentional impairments, a 
preferential impairment in delayed over immediate recall, increased perseverative errors on the 
Wisconsin card sort test, and decreased verbal fluency. In the sub-anesthetic dose utilized in this 
study, perceptual changes dissipate within 10-[ADDRESS_1282188] been no medical complications of 
ketamine administration to date. Out of the 18 adult subjects administered ketamine 0.5 mg/kg 
over [ADDRESS_1282189] not been 
adverse psychological reactions in any of the healthy adult subjects. In the Yale Pediatric 
Sedation Team’s experience, there have not been serious after-effects reported in follow-up 
phone calls after sedation with ketamine for medical purposes, although one family reported that 
their child had “weird dreams” the night following the procedure. There is no doubt that 
ketamine has clear and, in some cases, dramatic effects upon cognitive function. Some people 
find these effects pleasant or interesting and others find these effects frightening. In prior studies, 
all subjects have been thoroughly prepared for possible ketamine response prior to testing and 
debriefed at the end of each test day. As a result, only two subjects terminated their participation 
in either study prematurely. No subject has had adverse or lingering responses to ketamine 
following a test day. Also, none of the subjects experienced "flashbacks" to their ketamine 
experiences following a test day. These findings are very consistent with the earlier work of 
Domino and his colleagues. Thus, ketamine appears to be safe and, despi[INVESTIGATOR_912583]-term behavioral effects, well tolerated. The extent to which the effects of ketamine are 
perceived as unpleasant is context dependent and can be reduced by [CONTACT_912635]. The response to ketamine appears to be reduced 
by a number of medications, including benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_752009].

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 9/13/2017 VALID THROUGH 9/15/2018HIC# [PHONE_19581] 
Page [ADDRESS_1282190] reported 8 adverse events associated with ketamine 
administration to the Institutional Review Boards of Yale and/or the West Haven VA since 
October of 2000. None was considered serious and all resolved shortly after discontinuation of 
the ketamine infusion or within two weeks of the ketamine test day. Adverse events included 
nausea and vomiting, sedation, hypotension, insomnia and nightmares, headaches, visual and 
somatosensory perceptual alterations, strong paranoid feelings, and anxiety. 
None of the patients or healthy subjects studied to date has had any long-term adverse 
consequences as a result of ketamine administration. This impression is supported by [CONTACT_6492]-up 
data up to [ADDRESS_1282191]. Louis (unpublished data). We examined follow-up 
assessments collected in a sub-sample of [ADDRESS_1282192] be considered in the pediatric population, particularly in light 
of earlier studies with antidepressants in which pediatric patients experienced side effects/risks 
that adults did not. While ketamine specifically reduces suicidality in adults (40, 130) 
antidepressant medications have been associated with increased suicidal ideation in pediatric but 
not adult populations (42). In order to minimize the risk of increased suicidality in this study, 
subjects will (1) be excluded for active suicidal ideation at baseline, (2) undergo regular 
psychiatric assessments of suicidality and (3) have direct access to a child psychiatrist 
throughout the study.  Additionally, any subject with significant psychiatric side effects will be 
offered hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912584]’s inpatient psychiatric units.
As ketamine can be abused outside of its medical purpose, the risk of any potential addictive 
properties must also be considered. Ketamine has been used in the pediatric population for years, 
and the rates of ketamine addiction in the [LOCATION_002] remain very low (131). The ketamine 
infusion protocol in this trial is given slowly at a low dose (smaller than what is used in 
anesthesia) to minimize psychotomimetic effects (the high) associated with it. Adult studies have 
not reported problems with addiction following this ketamine protocol (102). The potential risk 
of abuse will be mitigated by [CONTACT_42792] a history of substance use disorder.  
Additionally, subjects and their parents will be warned about abuse potential in all consent/assent 
documents.
Midazolam administration: Midazolam, the active control in this study, is a medication that is 
approved by [CONTACT_395178] a sedative for both children and adults. It is a 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_139731] a short half-life that is used commonly in pediatric sedation and dentistry 
(117-123) and it is frequently administered rapi[INVESTIGATOR_912585] (we propose 0.045mg/kg over 40 minutes versus sedation dosing of 0.05 – 0.1mg/kg over 
2 minutes (122, 124)). In this study, the total midazolam dose is not to exceed 4.5mg, 
corresponding to a weight of 100kg. The most common side effects related to midazolam

Page [ADDRESS_1282193] and/or cardiac arrest. In younger children, these 
higher doses have been associated with a risk for paradoxical disinhibition or agitation. 
Midazolam, like ketamine, has a short half-life, and important adverse events related either drug 
are not observed after 30 minutes following drug administration (74). The Yale Pediatric 
Sedation team has vast experience with this medication given its common usage, and will be 
present during the infusion and until the patient has reached an appropriate state of recovery, as 
is done for all pediatric sedation procedures at YNHH. While the risks of serious adverse 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_912586], airway equipment and 
qualified physician personnel will be readily available. The reversal medication, flumazenil, will 
also be available, which can rapi[INVESTIGATOR_912587]. 
All benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_912588]. The single infusion and low dose proposed in this study would not be expected to 
result in any physiologic dependence. Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_625292] a class are also at risk to be abused for 
recreational use outside of medical purposes. The addictive potential of midazolam will be 
mitigated by [CONTACT_2329] a low dose and a slow infusion paradigm. Midazolam is used very frequently 
in the pediatric setting, and is not thought to be associated with precipi[INVESTIGATOR_912589]. The risks will further be mitigated by [CONTACT_912636]. Subjects will also be warned about the abuse potential 
in all consent/assent documents. 
Blood drawing/intravenous placement: Bruising or thrombosis can occur with placement of 
the intravenous line. A total of 110cc will be drawn over 4 weeks (30cc at baseline, 35cc on first 
infusion day (Day 0), 5cc on Day 1, 35cc on second infusion (Day 14), and 5cc on Day 15), 
which equates to 1.5cc/kg – 2.2cc/kg (based on average weights of 13-17yo adolescents). This 
amount drawn is considerably less than the 9.5cc/kg over 8-week requirement set by [CONTACT_912637]. The risks of blood draws include brief pain at the time of needle insertion, bruising, 
swelling at needle site and rarely, fainting or infection. 
Psychiatric evaluation, rating scales and questionnaires: These are all non-invasive, should 
add no risk, and have been used without difficulty or adverse events in previous studies with a 
similar population. The major disadvantage is the time taken to complete them.
Clinical Deterioration: There is a risk that a participant may experience of depression and/or 
anxiety symptoms or school refusal if applicable due to the natural course of the illness or poor 
response to ketamine administration. Because subjects will be asked to refrain from changing 
any psychotropic medication over the course of the study, clinical progress will be monitored 
closely with frequent CDRS-R and MADRS, and/or PARS and school attendance questionnaire, 
as well as ratings and frequent contact [CONTACT_752039]. The following are criteria for 
evaluation and possible pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological treatments: (1) an increase 
of 25% in CDRS-R score at any time over the course of treatment (lasting beyond acute 
administration studies), (2) new-onset of suicidal ideation or an increase in passive suicidal 
ideation. In the event that a subject is judged to remain significantly depressed and/or at 
increased risk for suicidality at the end of the study, we will help make appropriate referrals to 
outpatient providers, intensive outpatient programs or inpatient psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912590].  Investigators may continue close monitoring of significantly at risk subjects until such

Magnetic Resonance Imaging : MRI is considered to be among the safest ways to examine the 
human body. The [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set guidelines for magnet 
strength and exposure to radiowaves, and we carefully observe those guidelines. Subjects will be 
watched closely throughout the study. Some youths may feel uncomfortable or even anxious during 
the MRI. If this happens to a subject, the subject may ask to stop the study at any time and we will 
take the subject out of the MR scanner. On rare occasions, some people might feel dizzy, get an upset 
stomach, have a metallic taste in their mouth or feel tingling sensations or muscle twitches. These 
sensations usually go away quickly but subjects will be encouraged to tell the research staff if the 
subject experiences such sensations. MRI poses some risks for certain people. If the subject has some 
metal object(s) inside his or her body, the subject may not be in this study because the strong 
magnets in the MR scanner might harm him or her. Another risk is a metallic object flying through 
the air toward the magnet and hitting subjects. To reduce this risk, we require that all people involved 
with the study remove all metal from their clothing and all metal objects from their pockets. Nothing 
metal can be brought into the magnet room at any time. Also, once subjects are in the magnet, the 
door to the room is closed so that no one from outside inadvertently approaches the magnet. To 
minimize this risk, the participant will walk through a ferromagnetic detector to ensure he/she does 
not have any metal objects on his/her body.
10. Minimizing  Risks:  Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be 
minimized. 
Ketamine Administration: The dose of ketamine established in prior research (0.5 mg/kg over 
40 minutes) will be used in this study to minimize risks. The maximum total dose allowed in this 
study will be 50mg, corresponding to a weight of 100kg. The most common side effects of 
ketamine are (1) Elevated blood pressure (relatively common, but dose-dependent) breathing rate 
and pulse rate, (2) Local pain at injection site and temporary rash (rare) and (3) A variety of 
temporary psychological symptoms including, but not limited to anxiety, sadness, disorientation, 
insomnia, flashbacks, hallucinations, and psychotic-like symptoms.  These types of reactions 
have occurred in approximately 12% of patients given higher doses of ketamine when used for 
anesthesia.  These symptoms usually last no more than a few hours.  The most serious possible 
side effects of ketamine use are (1) Substance abuse/dependence, (2) Elevations in intraocular 
pressure that could lead to vision problems, (3) Allergic reaction and (4) Elevation in blood 
pressure that could result in stroke, heart problems and death.  All the serious possible side 
effects of ketamine are rare.  In order to minimize these risks for research subjects, vital signs 
will be monitored regularly throughout and for the first hour following the ketamine infusion.  A 
physician from the Yale Pediatric Sedation Service who is credentialed by [CONTACT_912638], with access to rescue equipment.

be provided at Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the site of infusion. 
All participants will be asked not to engage in demanding work for the first 3 days after the 
ketamine infusion. However, for those with school refusal, they continue with their regular 
school schedule.  If participants develop psychiatric symptoms, we may admit them to the

The consent forms will provide a description of what participants may experience during the 
intravenous ketamine infusion at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg over the course of [ADDRESS_1282196] reported mildly decreased concentration or a “hangover” on the day after ketamine. 
A research nurse will be present throughout the study to monitor the patient’s response and note 
any changes in physical or mental state. A research clinician will be present throughout the study 
to offer support and to help clarify the progress of the test day in case the medication causes 
feelings of confusion. A research doctor will also be available. The physician would be informed 
in case of any alarming changes in the patient’s physical or mental state. The research nurse will 
also offer support and provide consistent “reality testing” for individuals experiencing confusion 
or transient psychosis. 
Intravenous and oral diazepam will be kept available to control markedly distressing behavioral 
effects of ketamine, should they emerge.
All participants will be asked to contact [CONTACT_542987]. All 
participants will be given wallet-sized cards, which provide contact [CONTACT_3031]. The cards will

dependence, thereby [CONTACT_752040]/dependence by [CONTACT_103607].  
Midazolam Administration: The weight-based midazolam dosing established in prior ketamine 
trials in adults (0.045mg/kg) will be used to minimize risks, as this is considered a very low dose 
compared to the sedation literature (122). The maximum total dose allowed in this study will be 
4.5mg, corresponding to a weight of 100kg. The most common side effects related to midazolam 
infusions are hiccoughs, nausea, vomiting, coughing, headache, and drowsiness. In younger 
children, higher midazolam doses have also been associated with a risk for paradoxical 
disinhibition or agitation. Midazolam has one of the shortest half-lives of all of the 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and thus adverse events relating to the drug typi[INVESTIGATOR_912592] 30 minutes following drug administration (74). The most serious possible adverse reactions 
associated with midazolam, which are associated with higher doses than proposed in the study 
include: (1) substance abuse/dependence, (2) anaphylaxis or other allergic reaction, (3) 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_834790], (4) decreases in blood pressure resulting in end organ damage or 
death. The serious side effects associated with midazolam are rare. In order to minimize the risk 
of these side effects, subjects will be medically screened prior to enrollment in the study, vitals 
will be monitored regularly throughout the infusions (with continuous pulse oximetry), and 
regularly for the hour following the infusion. To additionally minimize the risks associated with 
midazolam, a physician from the Yale Pediatric Sedation service will pre-screen subjects and

All participants will be asked to contact [CONTACT_542987]. All 
participants will be given wallet-sized cards, which provide contact [CONTACT_3031]. The cards will 
identify the Yale Human Investigation Committee number for the study, the study PI (Michael

Blood drawing/intravenous placement: The risks of blood draws and intravenous line 
placements are rare, and when these are done under sterile conditions by [CONTACT_912639]. Numbing spray and distraction techniques will be offered prior 
to offset the discomfort of iv placement, as is commonly done in Pediatric medical settings.  
During the infusion days, blood draws will occur off of the non-infusing iv in order to prevent 
the discomfort of repeated needle sticks. The total amount of blood to be collected in this study is 
110cc over 4 weeks (30cc screening + 35cc first infusion day (Day 0) + 5cc on Day 1 + 35cc 
second infusion day (Day 14) + 5cc on Day 15). This amount ranges from 2.4cc/kg for a 45kg 
adolescent to 1.7cc/kg for a 65kg adolescent (weight range of 45kg – 65kg for 13-17yo girls and 
boys). This amount is well below the maximum of 9.5cc/kg over 8 weeks. 
Psychiatric evaluation, rating scales, and questionnaires: In order to minimize risks 
associated with the psychiatric ratings and ensure the accuracy of reporting, these measures will 
be administered by [CONTACT_912640] a study physician. Participants will 
be informed that they do not need to answer any question on the rating scales or questionnaires 
that make them feel uncomfortable. Participants will also be informed they can take a break if 
they become tired from any of the questions or ratings.
Clinical deterioration: If a  participant shows significant worsening of symptoms, he or she will 
be removed from the study and evaluated for clinically appropriate pharmacological and non-
pharmacological treatments by a clinic psychiatrist and followed until successful contact [CONTACT_4490] a 
community provider is made. Patients will be informed that the decision to initiate a course of

significantly depressed and/or at increased risk for suicidality at the end of the study, we will 
help make appropriate referrals to outpatient providers, intensive outpatient programs or 
inpatient psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912579].  Investigators may continue close 
monitoring of significantly at risk subjects until such referrals are provided and available to the 
study participant. Participants who have completed the trial must have a CDRS score of less than 
50 to be discharged from the study.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging : In addition to what was stated above, the following steps will be 
taken to minimize potential risks associated with MRI data collection: 
1) Claustrophobia 
The subjects can be given the option to acclimate to MR imaging by [CONTACT_912641]. In the 
scanner, subjects will have a mirror with which to view console and room. There will be constant 
assessment as to how subject is feeling via console speaker. Subjects can have a member of the 
research team sit in scan room during the study. We will talk with the subject, assess their condition, 
and ask whether or not they would like to continue. Subjects will be encouraged to relax, will be 
reassured that they are safe, and we will ask them to use the mirror, music or have someone in the 
room with them. They will be taken out of the scanner and their scanning terminated if they do not 
want to continue. 
2) Hearing damage due to loud noises produced by [CONTACT_912642]. The ear plugs and headphones are 
estimated to each reduce noise by [CONTACT_3450] [ADDRESS_1282202] will be taken out of the scanner and their scanning terminated if 
they do not want to continue. 
3) Dizziness 
Dizziness will be minimized by [CONTACT_912643] (dizziness 
occurs mainly when sliding in and out of scanner). Subjects will be informed the best approach to 
minimize dizziness is not to clasp one’s hands together and not to cross one’s legs during scanning. 
We will tell the subjects they might have dizziness as we position them into the scanner but that it 
subsides after they are in position. If the dizziness continues, we will take the subject out of the 
scanner and have them lie supi[INVESTIGATOR_912594]. Their scanning will 
be terminated if they do not want to continue. 
This MR study is for research purposes only and is not in any way a clinical scan to diagnose 
diseases for subjects. The scans in this study are not designed for diagnosis. The research team,
the MR technologist, and the Magnetic Resonance Research Center are not qualified to interpret the 
MR scans and cannot give the subject, the subject’s parents and/or guardians, or their doctor a 
diagnostic evaluation of the images. If we see something on a subject’s scan that might be medically 
significant, we will ask a radiologist or another physician to review the relevant images. If that 
person recommends that a subject should seek medical advice, then the primary investigator or 
consulting physician will contact [CONTACT_423]’s parent and/or guardian, about the situation, and 
recommend that the family seeks medical advice as a precautionary measure. At that point, the 
decision to seek advice or treatment is completely up to the parent/guardian, and their child’s doctor. 
If the child’s doctor wants to pursue additional MR images, the research scans from this study will 
not be available, and new scans that are appropriate for medical diagnosis will need to be done. 
While there are no known risks associated with MRI and pregnancy it is standard clinical practice to 
avoid MRI scans in pregnancy when possible and therefore there is not a large pool of data. Given 
this, pregnant subjects will be excluded from study. Scanning is performed on the campus of the Yale

11. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DSMP) based on the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final 
determination of the risk to subjects.) For more information, see the Instructions, page 24.
a. What  is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects 
participating in this study? 
We judge this study to be moderate risk, but with the possibility of direct benefit 
to the pediatric patient.
b. If  children are involved, what is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk 
level for the children participating in this study? 
We judge this study to fall into the following Pediatric risk category: 
45 CFR 46.405:  Research involving greater than minimal risk but presenting the prospect of direct 
benefit to the individual subjects
20 CFR 50.52:  Clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk but presenting the prospect of 
direct benefit to the individual subjects
 
Ketamine arm: Given the efficacy of ketamine as a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]-acting antidepressant and 
anxiolytic in adults, ketamine also may alleviate symptoms of depression and 
anxiety in adolescents. 
Midazolam arm: Midazolam has been previously used for short-term anxiolysis in both 
children and adults so it may reduce anxiety symptoms temporarily (for minutes 
to hours).  While the active control medication is not expected to alleviate 
symptoms of depression or anxiety over the longer term, the high level of contact 
[CONTACT_912644] (scheduled contact [ADDRESS_1282205]-infusion), 
as well as 24/7 access to Child Psychiatry may directly benefit the subjects.

sought).  During the review process, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_30277], require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. Either the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_912595], or require 
modifications.
2. The risks associated with the current study are deemed greater than minimal for the 
following reasons: (choose those that apply)
1. We  do not view the risks associated with the ketamine and midazolam infusions as 
minimal risks.
2. Given  the established safety and validity of the current ketamine dosing from our prior 
work in adults, as well as the frequent use of both ketamine and midazolam at higher 
doses in pediatric populations, we do not view the proposed studies as high risk.
Although we have  assessed the proposed study as one of greater than minimal risk, the potential 
exists for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it 
is not possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of 
first-hand experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for 
monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as follows:
3. Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the 
study procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] ([CONTACT_912657]) according to the 
following categories:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely: Adverse  event is likely not to be related to the investigational 
procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
4. Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate  adverse event
3. Severe  
5. Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:

Page 36 of 59In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_96081] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered serious if it 
results in any of the following outcomes:
1. Death;
2. A  life-threatening experience in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]; 
3. A  persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
4. A  congenital anomaly or birth defect; OR
5. Any  other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the other outcomes listed in this definition. 
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse 
Event.  Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an 
SAE.  It is important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” 
when determining whether reporting to the IRB is necessary.
6. Plan for reporting UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865] (including Adverse Events) to the IRB
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22416]: 
Any incident, experience or outcome that meets ALL 3 of the following criteria:
1. Is  unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the 
research procedures described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-
approved protocol and informed consent document and (b) the characteristics of the 
subject population being studied; AND 
2. Is  related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); AND
3. Suggests  that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, legal, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized.
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical or 
non-medical in nature, and include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected, and related 
adverse events and unanticipated adverse device effects.  Please note  that adverse events are 
reportable to the IRB as UPI[INVESTIGATOR_22417] 3 criteria listed above.
These UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]/SAEs will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Policy 710, using the 
appropriate forms found on the website. All related events involving risk but not meeting the 
prompt reporting requirements described in IRB Policy [ADDRESS_1282206] to oversight by a DSMB (or other monitoring 
entity that is monitoring the study on behalf of an industry sponsor).

12. Statistical  Considerations:  Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design. 
MDD Arm:  Controlled studies of ketamine (both saline and midazolam controls) in adult MDD 
report effect sizes of 1.5 (34, 132). If of similar efficacy in adolescents, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1282207] a difference from midazolam (α=0.05) for an effect size≥1.0. 
For the primary outcome, paired t-tests will compare MADRS score at 1 day following infusion 
between midazolam and ketamine. Scores of the other rating scales and time course will be 
assessed as secondary measures. It is quite possible that the benefits of ketamine will be smaller 
in adolescent depression compared to adult depression. Therefore, even if the results of our 
primary analysis are not statistically significant, we would consider having 6 of 18 patients 
exhibiting a response to ketamine (but not midazolam) during the first week following infusion as 
sufficient evidence towards conducting a more definitive trial. Treatment response for the MDD 
cohort is defined as 40% reduction in CDRS-R scores anytime in the first three days following 
infusion. 
Anxiety Arm:   Controlled studies of ketamine (saline controls) in adult MDD assessing anxiety as 
a secondary outcome have reported effect sizes of 1.4 at day 1.  Similarly, controlled studies of 
adults with OCD and PTSD both reported an ES≈0.9 at day 1 following infusion (96, 98). By 
[CONTACT_2163], in our adult social anxiety trial we observed an ES≈0.[ADDRESS_1282208] 
a difference from midazolam (α=0.05) for an effect size≥1.0.  For the primary outcome, paired t-
tests will compare MASC physical symptom subscale score at 1 day following infusion between 
midazolam and ketamine. Scores of the other rating scales and time course will be assessed as 
secondary measures. It is quite possible that the benefits of ketamine will be smaller in adolescent 
anxiety compared to previous adult trials. We would define treatment response as a CGI≤3 and a

Page 38 of 59greater than  35% improvement in the MASC physical symptoms subscale at any time point during 
the first 7 days following infusion.  The MASC physical symptoms was chosen as the primary 
outcome for the anxiety disorders arm of this trial because (1) we believe the physical symptoms 
of anxiety may change within a short time frame (e.g. 1 -day) whereas the behavioral symptoms 
of anxiety (avoidance, performance fears, social anxiety symptoms, fear of humiliation/rejection 
symptoms) are less likely to be detectable over short time periods.

5.Background Information: Provide a description of previous human use, known risks, and data 
addressing dosage(s), interval(s), route(s) of administration, and any other factors that might influence 
risks. If this is the first time this drug is being administered to humans, include relevant data on animal 
models. 
Ketamine: Ketamine has a wide margin of safety, and is usually given in doses of 1mg/kg –

Page 40 of 594.5mg/kg IV over [ADDRESS_1282210] evidence for medical and psychiatric safety (see Preliminary Data).  
There are several potential risks associated with ketamine use. These include 1) 
Cardiovascular: elevated blood pressure and pulse rate (relatively common and are dose-
dependent) and very rare changes in cardiac rhythm. 2) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]: respi[INVESTIGATOR_912596]; however, with high dose administration severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_912597] (<1.5% of transient apneic events at anesthetic doses in pediatric 
emergency room settings (133). Ketamine also has rarely been associated with laryngospasm. 3) 
Eyes: ketamine has been associated with slight elevations in intraocular pressure. 4) 
Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea and vomiting have been observed, however this is usually 
not severe. Vomiting has been seen in <4% of children in emergency room sedation settings 
(133). 5) Neurological: enhanced skeletal-muscular tone resulting in tonic clonic movements 
have rarely been observed with acute administration. 6) General: Anaphylaxis, local pain at 
injection site and transient rash have been described at the case report level. 7) Psychological: 
ketamine has been associated with a variety of transient symptoms including, but not limited to 
anxiety, dysphoria, disorientation, insomnia, flashbacks, hallucinations, and psychotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
Emergence reactions have occurred in approximately 12% of subjects given anesthetic doses of 
ketamine. These symptoms usually last no more than a few hours. However, recurrences have 
taken place up to 24 hours after the anesthetic dose administration. Recovery agitation after 
ketamine iv sedation in the pediatric emergency room has been seen in <1.5% of children (133). 
It is also believed that the incidence of the psychological disturbances is reduced with the use of 
lower doses. No residual adverse psychological effects are known to have resulted from the 
medical use of ketamine. 8) Substance abuse/dependence: Ketamine has been reported as a 
drug of abuse. Reports suggest that Ketamine dependence and tolerance are possible following 
prolonged administration. A withdrawal syndrome with psychotic features has been described 
following discontinuation of long-term ketamine use. Therefore, ketamine should be prescribed 
and administered with caution. It is unclear whether exposure to ketamine in the laboratory can 
result in ketamine use or abuse. All participants are encouraged not to participate if they have 
concerns about the possibility of ketamine abuse. Also, they are asked to contact [CONTACT_912645] a desire to use or abuse ketamine. All participants are advised that we 
would refer them to an appropriate treatment facility if necessary. In our experience doing 
research with ketamine, we are unaware of individuals abusing ketamine as a result of study 
participation.
Midazolam: Midazolam is used frequently in the pediatric emergency room and in sedation 
settings, either as a sole agent for anxiolysis, or in combination with other sedatives and 
anesthetics for more complex or prolonged procedures. It is typi[INVESTIGATOR_912598] 0.5-
0.5mg/kg over 2 minutes, depending on the intended level of sedation (mild versus deep sedation). 
It has been used routinely in Pediatrics since the 1990’s, typi[INVESTIGATOR_912599].
There are several potential risks associated with midazolam use: Cardiovascular: decrease in 
blood pressure (hypotension in <3% of pediatrics patients at sedation dosing ref) and very rarely, 
changes in cardiac rhythm. 2) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]: apnea, cough, hiccups, decreased tidal volume and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (transient apnea has been reported in <3% of pediatric patients at sedation 
dosing); with high dose administration severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], airway obstructions, apnea,

Page [ADDRESS_1282211] been reported. 3) Eyes: may cause nystagmus 4) Gastrointestinal: 
can be associated with nausea and vomiting (<3% of adult patients). 5) Neurological: may cause 
drowsiness, headache, oversedation; like all benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], midazolam has amnestic 
properties, more notable as dose increases 6) General: Anaphylaxis, local pain at injection site 
and transient rash have been reported. 7) Psychological: midazolam can be associated with 
paradoxical agitation (particularly in the elderly or in very young children), however is estimated 
at <1% of patients; there are also rare reports of emergence delirium, euphoria, and 
hallucinations, although these are associated with higher dosing that proposed here, Additionally, 
fast-acting reversal medications are available (flumazenil) that can terminate midazolam’s effects 
should the patient experience side effects during the infusion. 8) Substance abuse/dependence: 
As with all benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], physical and psychological dependence is associated with 
prolonged use. The single infusion proposed in the study is not expected to produce any 
physiological dependence. As all benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_912600], midazolam should 
be prescribed and administered with caution. Midazolam is used frequently in pediatric medical 
settings, at higher doses administered over shorter periods of time, and this use has not been 
linked with subsequent addition problems. That said, all participants are encouraged not to 
participate if they have concerns about the possibility of midazolam abuse. Also, they are asked 
to contact [CONTACT_912646] a desire to use or abuse midazolam. All 
participants are advised that we would refer them to an appropriate treatment facility if 
necessary. 
3. Source:  a) Identify the source of the drug or biologic to be used. 
Ketamine (Ketalar) and midazolam (Versed) will be obtained from the YNHH Research Pharmacy

5. Use of Placebo:  Not applicable to this research project
Provide a justification which addresses the following:
a.   Describe the safety and efficacy of other available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (if any). Standard treatments for 
depression and anxiety in adolescents include SSRIs, SNRIs, and psychotherapy. Nearly 40% of 
pediatric patients fail to respond to these first line pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_912603]-responders, 
nearly half remain depressed and anxious after switching medications and adding psychotherapy. 
Even when effective these medications take several weeks to take clinical effect, leaving a 
vulnerable period between the initiation of treatment and the start of resolution of symptoms of 
anxiety and depression. Importantly, these medications carry a black box warning for Pediatric 
patients as they are associated with a small, but significant increase in suicidality. Psychotherapy 
does not carry any specific medical or psychiatric risks, and subjects enrolled in the study are 
permitted to continue to engage in psychotherapy if they have already been doing so. They are also 
permitted to stay on their current pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_165838] 4-week trial, but are not allowed to 
make medication changes. 
b.   State the maximum total length of time a participant may receive placebo while on the study. 
One dose of IV midazolam will be given. However, the protocol will require 2 weeks in between 
each infusion. During this time the participant would not be receiving any additional treatments 
(they may remain on any current therapy (daily medications, psychotherapy, etc.)). 
c.   Address the greatest potential harm that may come to a participant as a result of not receiving    
     effective therapy (immediate or delayed onset.) 
Symptoms of MDD, anxiety and common comorbid symptoms may not improve or even worsen 
depending on the clinical course of illness.  Subjects have the option of withdrawing from the 
research protocol at any point if their symptoms worsen.  Additionally, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912604]’s symptoms worsen to the point of requiring 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912605].
d.   Describe the procedures that are in place to safeguard participants receiving placebo. 
As stated in the “Minimize Risk” section under “Clinical Deterioration above, if a participant 
shows significant worsening of symptoms, he or she will be evaluated for clinically appropriate 
pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments by a clinic psychiatrist and followed 
until successful contact [CONTACT_4490] a community provider is made. The crossover design also ensures 
that all subjects will receive the active medication within the month of the study protocol. 
Patients will be informed that the decision to initiate a course of psychotropic medication will 
not affect their eligibility to participate in future studies, to receive treatment at Yale, or to 
receive treatment on a private basis from a referring clinician.

Page 43 of 59 Yes   No See  HIC Application Instructions to view controlled substance listings. 
If yes, is the use of the controlled substance considered:
 Therapeutic: The use of the controlled substance, within the context of the research, has the 
potential to benefit the research participant.
 Non Therapeutic: Note, the use of a controlled substance in a non-therapeutic research study 
involving human subjects may require that the investigator obtain a Laboratory Research License. 
Examples include controlled substances used for basic imaging, observation or biochemical studies 
or other non-therapeutic purposes.
 
7.Continuation  of Drug Therapy After Study Closure    Not applicable to this project
Are subjects provided the opportunity to continue to receive the study drug(s) after the study has 
ended?  Yes  If yes, describe the conditions under which continued access to study drug(s) may 
apply as well as conditions for termination of such access. 
                    No    If no, explain why this is acceptable.
This study is designed to determine the short-term safety and benefit of ketamine as a 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_912606]. Further studies will be needed to

(f)  In addition to the study investigators, co-investigators, and study staff, members of HIC and 
the study sponsor may have access to the study data. 
(g) A Certificate of Confidentiality has been obtained to protect the drug toxicology results. Where 
possible, information will be destroyed that may link the subject to illicit drug use. Since a YNHH 
chart will need to be created for these subjects by [CONTACT_752050], there is a concern 
that these results could be traced back to the subject. Subjects who test positive on the toxicology test 
will not be able to participate in this protocol. Subjects will be encouraged to seek treatment for their 
substance use, as appropriate.
(h)  Yes. Evidence of child abuse or situations in which the subject is deemed a danger to self or 
 others will be reported.  
         SECTION  IX: POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the 
research, either to the subject(s) or to society at large. (Payment of subjects is not considered a 
benefit in this context of the risk benefit assessment.) 
Ketamine arm: While there may be no direct benefit from a subject’s participation in this study, 
the success of ketamine as a rapid-acting antidepressant in adult patients suggest that adolescent 
subjects may receive a significant benefit. Given the crossover design, all subjects will be 
exposed to the potentially beneficial intervention. The potential benefits to society of these 
investigations are considerable. Depression and anxiety continue to be a major public health

Midazolam arm: While the active control medication is not expected to significantly relieve 
depressive symptoms, the high frequency of contact [CONTACT_4490] a child psychiatrist and research staff 
may provide a benefit to subjects.   Patients with have schedule contact [CONTACT_912651] 1 (in person), 2, 3, 5, 7 (in person), 10, and 14 (in person) after the infusion, and will have

benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_912610].
         SECTION  X: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
1.     Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research?
The subject and his/her parent/guardian may discuss other non-research treatments for MDD 
and/or anxiety and/or SRB with their practitioner or continue with their current stand of care. 
Other treatment alternatives include: change to another class of antidepressants (e.g. selective 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Monoamine 
uptake inhibitors (MAOIs), psychotherapy (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy, insight-oriented 
psychotherapy). 
 
2. Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be 
made to subjects, the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving this 
compensation. 
Subjects will be paid $[ADDRESS_1282217] the study early, they will be compensated $10 for each completed in-person study 
visit (6 total), $5 for each telephone study assessment (8 total). Additionally, participants will be 
paid $25 for each of the infusion days (2 total). Subjects will be paid $50 for each MRI and $25 
for each neuropsychological assessment (Baseline and 24 hours after each infusions) (3 Total 
each.). 
Participants will receive an additional $75 if they complete all assessments for SRB.
3. Costs  for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly describe the subject’s costs 
associated with participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that 
will be provided at no cost to subjects.   
The study drug and all medical treatment in this research study will be provided free of charge. 
There will be no charges for study visits. Costs of the participant are thus limited to the cost of 
transportation to and from the study appointments and their time spent participating in the study.

Page 51 of 594. In  Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than minimal risk.
a.     Will medical treatment be available if research-related injury occurs? 
If a physical injury or illness occurs as a direct result of participation in this study, study 
physicians and nursing personnel will provide emergency medical care and ensure that research 
participants receive prompt evaluation and medical treatment as necessary. In severe cases this 
may involve a transfer to Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9487]. The cost of treatment for 
any such injury or illness will not be paid for through the study and will be the responsibility of 
the research participant.
b. Where and from whom may treatment be obtained? 
In the event of a significant medical emergency the participant will be treated at Yale New 
Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (the location of the infusion). Should there be adverse psychiatric effects as a 
result of the study they will receive inpatient treatment by [CONTACT_912652][INVESTIGATOR_912611].  The cost of treatment for any such injury or illness will 
not be paid for through the study and will be the responsibility of the research participant.
c.     Are there any limits to the treatment being provided? 
In the unlikely event that any psychiatric care more intensive than regular clinic visits is required 
as a direct result of participation in this study, study personnel will provide emergent care and 
stabilization. If longer-term psychiatric care is required, beyond what is normally provided by a 
research clinic, then study personnel will provide referrals and otherwise endeavor to assist 
participants in arranging such care. 
d.     Who will pay for this treatment? 
The cost of treatment for any such injury or illness will not be paid for through the study and will 
be the responsibility of the research participant.  These costs include emergency care for side-
effects of ketamine and psychiatric treatment for worsening of depression and anxiety symptoms 
that may occur during the course of the trial.
Participants do not give up any of their legal rights by [CONTACT_752051]. 
e.     How will the medical treatment be accessed by [CONTACT_1766]? 
As part of the study protocol, participants will be systematically asked about any adverse events 
they experience and their depressive symptom severity by [CONTACT_3462]. They will also be 
instructed to inform study personnel if they believe they have suffered an adverse event or 
worsening of their depressive symptoms as a result of the protocol.

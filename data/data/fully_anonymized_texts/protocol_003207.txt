TITLE OF STUDY:  A Randomized, Double-blind, Active-con trolled, Phase 3 Study Evaluating the 
Efficacy and Safety of ABP 959 Compared With Ecul izumab in Adult Subjec ts With Paroxysmal 
Nocturnal Hemo globinuria (PNH ) 
STUDY CENTERS:   Approximatel y 45 sites globall y 
STUDY PERIODS:   Subjects will be treated in 2 study 
periods.  Period 1 will be 52 weeks in duration.  Period 2 
will be 26 weeks in duration. PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 3 
PLANNED STUDY DATES:   The planned duration of the clinical study is approximately 
30 months (approximately 12 months for enrollment and approximately 18 months for treatment), 
from approximatel y Q1 2019 to Q3 2021. 
OBJECTIVES:   
Primary Objective:  The primary objective for this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ABP 959 
compared with that of eculizumab base d on control of intravascular hemolysis. 
Secondary Objective:  The secondary objective is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), 
and immunogenicity of ABP 959 compared with that of eculizumab.  
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:  This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 
2-period crossover study in adult subjects wi th PNH.  Approximately 40 subjects will be 
randomized (1:1) to receive each investigational product (IP) in 1 of 2 sequences, either 
treatment T followed by [CONTACT_3148] R (TR) or treat ment R followed by [CONTACT_3148] T (RT).  Treatment 
will be administered over 2 periods: Period 1 will be 52 weeks in duration; Period [ADDRESS_28835] dose of IP admin istration and will be stratified by [CONTACT_29617] 
(RBC) transfusion received within the last 12 months before randomization (yes vs no). 
Period 1 (week 1 to week 53): 
Treatment T:  ABP 959 at a dose of 900 mg intr avenously (IV) every 14 ± 2 days for 52 weeks 
Treatment R:  eculizumab at a dose of 900 mg IV every 14 ± 2 days for 52 weeks 
 
Period 2: (week 53 to week 79) 
Treatment T:  ABP 959 at a dose of 900 mg IV every 14 ± 2 days for 26 weeks 
Treatment R:  eculizumab at a dose of 900 mg IV every 14 ± 2 days for 26 weeks 
Subjects may require dose adjustments  for IP based on signs and symptoms of intravascular 
hemolysis, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) le vels.  Upon investigator’s determination of 
resolution of symptoms, subjects should resume the 900 mg dose within the recommended 
dosing schedule ie, every 14 ± [ADDRESS_28836] planned dose of IP in 
Period 2 (ie, at week 79).    An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will evaluate the safety data throughout the 
study.

ConfidentialNUMBER OF SUBJECTS :Approximately 40 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to 1 of the 
2treatment sequences . The sample size of 40 was chosen to provide approximately 87% power 
to demonstrate non-inferiority (NI)at a 1-sided significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_28837] coefficient of variation
(CV)of 130% for ABP 959 and eculizumab, a true geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 1 between 
ABP 959 and eculizumab, a nNImargin of 2.873 , and a 10% dropout rate. The 2.873 margin is 
considered appro priate to rule out a potential clinically relevant difference, as it essentially 
equates to a mean LDH in th e ABP 959 arm of less than 1.5 -fold of the mean LDH in the 
eculizumab arm. The sample size of 40 will also provide greater than 95 %power to
demonstrate similarity at a [ADDRESS_28838] curve (AUEC) of LDH from week [ADDRESS_28839] CV of 34%, a true GMR of 1 between ABP 959 and eculizumab, a similarity margin of 
(0.77, 1.30), and a 10% dropout rate .Blinded assessments of the inter -subject CV of LDH and 
the intra -subject CV of time -adjusted AUEC of LDH will be performed. If the aggregated intra-
subject CV of AUEC is greater than 44 %,additional subjects will be enrolled if feasible .If the 
aggregated inter-subject CV of LDH is greater than 130%, the primary  endpoint of parallel 
comparison of LDH at week 27 will be replaced by [CONTACT_29620] 53 and 
week 79.

STATISTICA L METHODS: 
The primary  analysis of the primary  endpoint of week 27 LDH for the parallel comparison will be 
conducted on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) , consisting of all randomized subjects, with treatment 
as randomized in Period [ADDRESS_28841]: A BP959
Clinica l Study Protocol: 20150168
Date : 05March2020 Page 7of 71
ConfidentialThe clinical similarity of the week 27 LDH between treatments will be assessed by [CONTACT_17921] 
1-sided 9 7.5% upper confidence interval (CI) limit for the GMR of the LDH at week 27 between 
ABP 959 and eculizumab treatment with an NI margin of 2.873. The point estimate of the mean 
difference in the log -transformed LDH and the corresponding 1-sided 9 7.5% upper CIlimitwill be 
estimated from a linear mixed effects model with treatment, stratification factor, week 1 LDH 
value, time (as a continuous varia ble), andtreatment by [CONTACT_29624], and 
subject as a random effect. Lactate dehydrogenase values from all assessed time points from 
week 13 to week 27 will be included in the mixed model.  The point estimate and the upper CI
limitfor the GMR will then be calculated by [CONTACT_29625].
The primary  analysis of the primary endpoint of time -adjusted AUEC of LDH for the crossover 
comparison will be conducted on the Modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS), consisting of all 
randomized subjects who have a nLDH-time profile evaluable for the time -adjusted AUEC within
at least one of the following 14 -week assessment period s: week [ADDRESS_28842].  T he time -adjusted 
AUEC will be calculated by [CONTACT_29626] (in 
weeks) for each individual subject within each 14- week assessment period .  
The clinical similarity of the AUEC between treatments will be assessed by [CONTACT_17921] 2 -sided 
90% CI for the GMR of the time -adjusted AUEC of LDH ( week 13 to week 27, week 39 to week
53,and week 65 to week 79) between ABP 959 and eculizumab treatment with a similarity 
margin of (0.77, 1.30). The point estimate of the mean difference in the log -transformed time -
adjusted AUEC and the corresponding 2-sided 90% CI will be calculated from a linear mixed 
effects model with tr eatment, stratification factor, assessment period , and sequence as fixed 
effects, a nd subject as a random effect. The point estimate and CI for the GMR will then be 
calculated by [CONTACT_29627].
The analysis of secondary endpoints (except for PK)will be conducted on the Full A nalysis Set
(FAS). Total complement, total hemoglobin, serum -free hemoglobin, haptoglobin, bilirubin, 
degree of hemoglobinuria, and type III erythrocytes (%) at week s27,39, 53, 65,and 79 will be 
summarized descriptively . For the endpoint of RBC transfusions, summary  statistics for the 
number of packed red cells transfused per month after week 13 will be presented. A descriptive 
summary  of LDH at each time point through the EOS visitwill be presented. Indivi dual and mean 
LDH-time profile sthrough theEOS visitwill also be presented graphically.
The secondary endpoint of crossover comparison of LDH at week 53 and week 79 will be 
evaluated descriptively.  The point estimate of the mean difference in the log -transformed LDH 
between treatments and the corresponding 1-sided 97.5% upper CIlimitwill be calculated from a 
linear mixed effects model with treatment, stratification factor, period, and sequence as fixed 
effects ,and subject as a random effect. The poi nt estimate and 1-sided upper 97.5% CIlimitfor 
the GMR will then be calculated by [CONTACT_29627].   
The PK Concentration Analysis Set will be defined as the subset of subjects in the Safety 
Analysis Set who have at least 1 serum concentration of ABP 959 or eculizumab.  Serum ABP 
959 and eculizumab trough concentrations will be summarized descriptively on the PK 
Concentration Analy sis Set for the study through the EOS visitby [CONTACT_29628] (ABP 959 or 
eculizumab) and by [CONTACT_29629]. 
The PK Parameter Analy sis Set will be defined as the subset of subjects in the Safety  Analy sis 
Set who have an evaluable ABP 959 or eculizumab serum concentration -time profile from week 
13 to week 15.  Pharmacokinetic AUC from week 13 to week15will be an alyzed on the PK 
Parameter Analy sis Set according to the actual treatment received with GMR and 90% CI 
provided descriptively. 
Safety will be assessed for the study through the EOS visitin the Safety Analy sis Set, consisting

Confidential6 INTRODUCTION
6.1 Disease Review
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, life- threatening ,bone marrow 
disorder characterized by [CONTACT_29636], bone marrow failure, and
thrombo -embolic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] ,and is associated with a significant increase in mortality, 
development of arterial and venous thrombo -embolic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] ,visceral organ 
damage, and rapid deterioration in quality of life ( Kelly et al, 2009; Hill et al, 2007; 
Hillmen et al ,2006; Rother et al, 2005). The disease is caused by [CONTACT_29637] a 
clone of hematopoietic cells lacking glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchored 
membrane proteins (eg, CD 55 and CD 59) , which leads to chronic, complement -
mediated intravascular hemolysis. The clinical symptoms of the chronic complement 
activity and hemolysis include abdominal pain, chest pain, dyspnea, and hemoglobinuria, and life -threatening complications include thromboembolism, 
pulmonary hypertension, and impaired renal function (Hill et al, 2007). Laboratory 
evidence of intravascular hemolysis includes high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and bilirubin, and low or undetectable serum haptoglobin. Lactate dehydrogenase is a 
sensitive biochemical marker of intravascular hemolysis and can be more than 25times the normal concentration during periods of severe hemolysis (Rother et 
al,2005) . 
6.2 Eculizumab
Eculizumab, the active ingredient in Soliris
®(Alexion Pharmaceuticals), is a 
monoclonal antibody that specifically binds with high affinity to the complement 
protein C5, thereby [CONTACT_29638] C5a and C5b and preventing the 
generation of the terminal complement complex C5b- 9. Eculizumab inhibits terminal 
complement -mediated intravascular hemolysis in patients with PNH ,atypi[INVESTIGATOR_29601], and refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (Soliris®
Summary of Product Characteristics , 2018 ). 
6.3 Compound Review
ABP 959is being developed as a biosimilar to Soliris®(eculizumab ), for the treatment 
of PNH and other indications .  The active ingredient of ABP 959is an anti -C5
monoclonal antibody thathas the same amino acid sequence as eculizumab and 
equivalent nonclinical pharmacologic function, based on comprehensive bioanalytical 
assays .  ABP 959has the same pharmaceutical f orm,dosage strength, route of 
administration, and dosing regimen as US- and European Union ( EU)-licensed 
eculizumab .

Confidential6.4 Study Rationale
The similarity of ABP 959 to eculizumab has been shown using bioanalytical 
methods and nonclinical studies (refer to the investigator’s brochure for additional 
information).  As outlined in the guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing monoclonal antibodies ( EMA/CHMP/BM WP/403543/2010 ), applicants are 
expected to provide data on similarity of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics(PK/PD), safety, and efficacy.  
In the US , EU, and much of the world, laws, regulations, and guidances have been or 
are being put in place to increase availability of biological treatments by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_29602] ( CHMP/437/04 Rev 1 ;
EMEA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012; EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/[ZIP_CODE]/2005 Rev 1; US FDA 
2012a; US FDA 2012b).  A biosimilar product, generally, is one that is highly similar 
to a licensed biologic reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically 
inactive components , and there are no clinically relevant differences between the 
biosimilar and reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.  Biosimilarity 
is demonstrated by [CONTACT_29639], including quality, nonclinical, and clinical evidence.  The quality and nonclinical data for ABP 959 and eculizumab are 
summarized in the investigator’ s brochure.  The current study is designed to 
demonstrate that there is no clinically relevant difference between ABP [ADDRESS_28857]: A BP959

Confidential8 INVESTIGA TIONA L PLA N
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a randomized, double -blind, active- controlled , 2-period crossover study in 
adult subjects with PNH.  
The study will be run in approximately 45sites globally .
Approximately 40 subjects will be randomized ( 1:1) to 1 of the 2 treatment 
sequences, either treatment T followed by [CONTACT_3148] R ( TR)or treatment R followed 
by [CONTACT_3148] T ( RT).Treatments will be administered over 2 periods .  Period 1 will 
be 52 weeks in duration ; Period [ADDRESS_28859] dose of IP administration (defined as day 1) and will be stratified by [CONTACT_29640] ( RBC) transfusion received within the last 12 months before randomization (yes 
vs no).
The treatment sequences will be as shown in Figure 1:
Sequence T R:ABP 959 for 52 weeks in Period 1 followed by [CONTACT_29641] 
26weeks in Period 2, each at a dose of 900 mg administered as an intravenous (IV) 
infusion every 14 ± 2 days
Sequence RT: Eculizumab for 52 weeks in Period 1 followed by [CONTACT_29642] 959 for 
26weeks i n Period 2, each at a dose of 900 mg administered as an IV infusion every 
14 ± [ADDRESS_28860] planned dose 
of IP in Period 2 (ie, at week 79).   
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC ) will perform safety reviews
approximately every 6 months throughout the study (Section 12.6.8 ).  Blinded study 
data will also be monitored on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_29643]. 
The study endpoints will be analyzed as described in Section 12.6.

If any scheduled dose of IPis delayed from the schedule d visit date (by [CONTACT_726] 
2days), then the dose will be administered as soon as possible, and subsequent 
doses will be adjusted accordingly to remain every 14 days (± 2days ) from the 
adjusted dose date.
Administration of IP(ABP 959 or eculizumab) will be withheld for any subject who 
experiences a Grade 3 or 4 adverse event per the National Cancer Institute ( NCI; 
US) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) ,version 5.0,
reported by [CONTACT_29651]. Re-exposure to IPmay occur only when 
the event resolves to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_28880]’s baseline and if the investigator and 
[COMPANY_010], or its designee, agree that subject safety will not be compromised.
Subjects are to be discontinued from the study and treated per standard of care if 
they develop a meningococcal infection or become pregnant.
8.5.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Any experimental (biological or non -biological) therapy (within or outside a clinical 
study) is prohibited at any time du ring the study.

8.5.9 Assignment to Treatment
Whensubjects enter the screening period for the study , the investigator (or designee) 
will contact [CONTACT_29653] a unique 11-digit subject identification number 
before any study procedures are performed.  This number will be used to identify the 
subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject.   Unique [ADDRESS_28882] identification numbers will be 
assigned in sequential order for each site in the format 168XXXXX ###, where 
“168XXXXX ” refers to the site number, and “###” refers to the sequential subject 
ordering as each subject at a site is entered into the IXRS (eg, [PHONE_429] ).  
Signing of the ICF establishes entry into the screening period.
The subject identificati on number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed at the time of rescreening, enrollment, or 
randomization. This number will not necessarily be the same as the randomization 
number assigned for the study.
Upon com pletion of screening and confirmation of eligibility , the investigator (or 
designee) will contact [CONTACT_29654] 1 of the 
2treatment sequences (Figure 1).  Randomization will occur within [ADDRESS_28883] 12 months before randomization (yes vs no).
8.5.[ADDRESS_28884]’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject.  Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation.  The investigator is strongly encouraged to contact [CONTACT_29655] (or

The subject has been followed for a period of a t least 1 year (± 4 weeks) 
post-administration of ABP 959 or eculizumab .
All follow -up results, both positive and negative ,will be communicated to the sites.  More 
frequent testing (eg, every month) or testing for a longer period of time may be 
requested in the event of safety -related concerns. 
Subjects who test positive for binding, non -neutralizing antibodies and have clin ical

The definition of adverse event sincludes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine 
headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, an d/or duration, and/or has an 
association with a significantly worse outcome.  In the case of worsening of a 
pre-existing condition, the start date of the event is the date when the first signs of 
worsening were observed.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened during the 
study or involves an intervention ,such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical 
procedure while on study ,is not considered an adverse event .

relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “ Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused b y the IP?”
Worsening of PNH should not be reported as an adverse event .  However, any specific 
symptoms or sequelae of the disease progression or recurrence ( eg, organ failure, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]) will be considered adverse event s and will be captured on the 
eCRF.
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value foranyindividual study subject repr esents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator ’sjudgment ) are not to be 
recorded as adverse event s.  However, laboratory value c hanges that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse event s.  W here applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event s.
The investigator ’s clinical judgment is used to de
termine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event .  A subject, or subject’s legal guardian, 
can also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to an adverse event .  If the subject 
withdraws consent, the subject is encouraged t o undergo, at a minimum, an EOS

11.4 Pregnancy Reporting
Female Subjects Who Become Pregnant
Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject who 
becomes pregnant while taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_29611] .
Information will be recorded on the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet.  The 
worksheet must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety within [ADDRESS_28909]’s pregnancy.  (Note: Sites are not required to provide any 
information on the Pregnancy Notification W orksheet that violates the country or 
regions local privacy laws).
After obtaining the female subject’s signed authorization for release of 
pregnancy and infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy 
and infant health information and complete the pregnancy questionnaire for any 
female subject who becomes pregnant w hile taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_29612] .  This information will be forwarded to [COMPANY_010] Global 
Patient Safety.  Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12 months 
after the birth of the child (if applicable).
Any termination o f pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety, 
regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for 
procedure. 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an adverse event or serious 
adverse event, any pregnancy complication or report of a congenital anomaly or 
developmental delay, fetal death, or suspected adverse reactions in the neonate 
will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event.  Note that an 
elective termination with no information on a fe tal congenital malformation or 
maternal complication is generally not considered an adverse event, but still 
must be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a pregnancy exposure case.
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as 
a serious adverse event (eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous 
abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal congenital 
anomaly) the investigator will report the event as a serious adverse event.
Any serious adverse event occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy 
which is considered reasonably related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_1275], will be reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety.  W hile the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former s tudy 
subjects, he or she may learn of a serious adverse event through spontaneous 
reporting. 
Any female subject will be discontinued from the study and treated per standard 
of care if they become pregnant.

The investigator will attempt to obtain a signed authorization for release of 
pregnancy and infant health information directly from the pregnant female 
partner to obtain additional pregnancy information.
After obtaining the female partner’s signed authorization for release of 
pregnancy and infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy 
outcome and infant health information on the pregnant partner and her baby [CONTACT_29662].  This information will be forwarded to 
[COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety.

12.2 Sample Size Estimation
Approximately 40subjects will be randomized 1:1 to 1of the 2 treatment sequences (TR 
or RT [Section 8.1]). 
The sample size of 40 was chosen to provide approximately 87% power to demonstrate 
non-inferiority  (NI)at a 1-sided significance level of 0.02 5 on the primary endpoint 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]) of week [ADDRESS_28912] 
coefficient of variation (CV)of 130% for ABP 959 and eculizumab, a true geometric 
mean ratio (GMR) of 1 between ABP 959 and eculizumab, an NImargin of 2.873 , and a 
10% dropout rate. The 2.873 margin is considered appropriate to rule out a potential 
clinically relevant difference, as itessentially equates to a mean LDH i n the ABP 959 
arm of less than 1.5- foldof the mean LDH in the eculizumab arm.
The sample size of 40 will also provide greater than 95% power to demonstrate 
similarity at a 2- sided significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_28913] CV of 34%, a 
true GMR of 1 between ABP 959 and eculizumab, a similarity margin of (0.77, 1.30), and 
a 10% dropout rate .

Date: 05March [ADDRESS_28934] may enter the study until this approval has been obtained. A copy of the 
approval (where one is provided as requested , according to local country requirements) 
will be provided to the investigator and to the IRB/IEC .
15.2 Protocol Amendments
In accordance with ICH Topic E6 (R1) Guideline for GCP ,the investigator should not 
implement any deviation from or changes to the protocol without agreement by [CONTACT_29688]/IEC of a protocol amendment, except 
where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when the 
change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (eg, change in 
monitor[s], change of telephone number [s]).
Any change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any potential 
amendment must be approved by [CONTACT_456] . A written amendment must be submitted 
to the appropriate regulatory authorities and to t he IRB/IEC assuming this responsibility. 
The investigator must await IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments before 
implementing the changes, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to subject s. In these cases, the IRB/IEC must be notified within 5days of the 
change.
All amendments to the protocol must be approved in writing by [CONTACT_29689]/IEC , except for administrative amendments, which 
require notification but not written approval. Once approved, the protocol amendment 
will be distributed to all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29614], with instructions to append the 
amendment to the protocol.
If, in the judgment of the local IRB/IEC orthe investigator and/or sponsor, the protocol
amendment alters the study design orprocedures and/or increases the potential risk to 
the subject , the currently approved written ICFwill require modification. The modified 
ICFmust also be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_456] , appropriate regulatory 
authorities, and the IRB/IEC . In such cases, repeat informed consent must be obtained 
from subject s enrolled in the study before participation continues.

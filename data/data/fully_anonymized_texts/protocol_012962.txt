1. Protocol Summary  
1.1 Synopsis  
Protocol Title:   A Double -blind, Randomized, Placebo -controlled Phase 2 Study to 
Evaluate Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Olpasiran (AMG 890) (a GalNAc -
conjugated Small Interfering RNA [siRNA]) in Subjects with Elevated Lipoprotein(a)  
Short Protocol Title:   Olpasiran trials of Cardiovascular Events And Lipoprotei N(a) 
reduction – DOSE  Finding Study (OCEAN[a] -DOSE)  
Study Phase:   2 
Indication:   Cardiovascular disease  
Rationale  
Study 20180109 is a double -blind, randomized, multicenter dose finding study in 
subjects wit h atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]).  
The primary objective is to test olpasiran subcutaneous (SC) once every 12 weeks 
(Q12W) compared with placebo on percent change from baseline in Lp(a) after 
36 weeks of treatmen t.  Additionally, an exploratory dose of 225 mg once  every 24 
weeks (Q24W) will be evaluated.  Olpasiran is being developed for the treatment of 
patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and elevated Lp(a) to reduce the 
risk of cardiovascular ev ents.  Lp(a) reductions of  80 from baseline are anticipated 
with olpasiran and it is expected that this level of reduction in Lp(a) may result in 
clinically meaningful cardiovascular benefit in patients with atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (Kamst rup et al, 2009, Burgess et al, 2018, Lamina et al, 2019, 
Madsen et al, 2020).  Lp(a) baseline is defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Objective(s)/Endpoint(s)  
 
Objectives  Endpoints  
Primary  
 To evaluate the effect of olpasiran 
administered subcutaneous (SC) once 
every 12  weeks (Q12W) compared with 
placebo, on percent change from baseline 
in lipoprotein(a)  (Lp[a]) after 36  weeks of 
treatment   Percent change in Lp(a) from baseline at 
week  36 
Primary Estimand  
The primary estimand consists of:  
 The target population, which is adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 
elevated Lp(a)  
 The primary variable, which is percent change from baseline in Lp(a) at week 36  
 The intercurrent events which are the discontinuation of investigatio nal product and 
excluded medication(s) taken during study.  For the primary estimand, the treatment effect 
will be estimated in subjects who are randomized and received at least [ADDRESS_325978] regardless of the occurrence of these interc urrent events  
 The summary measure, which is the difference between olpasiran  and placebo in the 
mean percent change from baseline in Lp(a) at week  36 
 The treatments to be compared are each olpasiran  group vs. placebo  
The primary estimand is the difference between each olpasiran  group and placebo in the mean 
percent change from baseline in Lp(a) at week  36 in adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease and with elevated Lp(a) who are randomized and received at le ast [ADDRESS_325979] and excluded 
medication(s) taken during the study.

Objectives  Endpoints  
Secondary  
 To evaluate the effect of olpasiran 
administered SC Q12W compared with 
placebo, on percent change from baseline 
in: 
- Lp(a) after 48  weeks of treatment  
- Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL -C) after 36  and 48 weeks of 
treatment  
- Apolipoprotein(B) (ApoB) after 36  and 
48 weeks of treatment   Percentage change from baseline in:   
- Lp(a) at week  48 
- LDL-C at week  36 and week  48 
- ApoB at week  36 and week  48 
 To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
properties of olpasiran   PK parameters for olpasiran including, but 
not limited to, maximum observed 
concentration (C max), and the area under  
the concentration time curve (AUC)  
Estimands for Secondary  Endpoints  
The estimands for the secondary endpoints Lp(a), LDL -C, and ApoB are the differences 
between each olpasiran group and placebo in the mean percent change from baseline in:  
 Lp(a) at week 48  
 LDL-C at week 36  
 LDL-C at week 48  
 ApoB at week 36  
 ApoB at week 48  
For adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and elevated Lp(a) who are randomized 
and received at least [ADDRESS_325980] and excluded medication(s) taken during the study.  
Safety 
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
olpasiran SC Q12W compared with 
placebo in subjects with elevated Lp(a)   Treatment emergent adverse events  
 Clinically significant safety laboratory 
values and vital signs at each scheduled 
visit 
Overall Design  
This is a phase 2, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, multicenter, dose 
finding study to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olpasiran on Lp(a) compared 
to placebo in subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and with eleva ted 
Lp(a).   
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio, with 4 arms being treated with olpasiran 
and 1 arm with placebo (some olpasiran arms will include placebo to maintain blind).  
The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_236478](a)  200 nmol/ L vs.  200 nmol/L 
and by [CONTACT_11338] (Japan vs. Non -Japan).  
The study treatment period is [ADDRESS_325981] of care (including stable lipid -altering therapy) per their local guidelines during 
the treatment period and extended safety follow -up period.  
Number of Subjects  
Approximately [ADDRESS_325982]:  Olpasiran  
Protocol Number:  20180109  
Date:  [ADDRESS_325983] Eligibility Criteria  
A summary of eligible criteria for subjects to be included in the study are:  
Male or female adults age 18 to 80 years old, fasting Lp(a)  150 nmol/L during 
screening, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and subjects receiving lipid -altering 
therapy (not required to participate in the study), must remain on stable dose.  
For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section 5.1 to Section 5.2. 
Treatments  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following 5 treatment groups:  
 Group 1:  10 mg Q12W  
 Group 2:  75 mg Q12W  
 Group 3:  225 mg Q12W  
 Group 4:  225 mg Q24W  
 Group 5:  Placebo Q12W  
Procedures  
After providing informed consent, eligible subjects will undergo the following 
assessments during this study:  physical examination, neurological examination, 
physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference) vital signs (blood pressure 
and heart rate),electrocardiogram, laboratory assessments (including serum pregnancy 
test, if applicable, serum Lp(a), lipi[INVESTIGATOR_267725], very low -density lipoprotein, 
coagulation, hematology, hemoglobin A1C, chemistry, high sensitivity C -reactive protein  
(hs-CRP) , estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinalysis, anti-olpasiran antibody 
test, biomarker, pharmacokinetic ( PK) assessments, and a PROMIS (patient -reported 
outcomes measurement information system) general health assessment.  Reporting of 
adverse events, serious adverse events, and cases of pregnancy and lactat ion exposure 
will be performed as described in Section 8.2.[ADDRESS_325984] early terminated.  
Final analysis will be performed when all randomized subjects either complete the 
extended safety follow -up and ended the study or early terminate from the study.  
The primary endpoint (percent change from baseline in Lp(a) at week 36) will be 
compared between groups using repeated measures linear effects model including 
terms of treatment group, stratification factor, scheduled visit, and the interaction of 
treatment with scheduled visit.  Hochberg procedure will be used to control the type I

CONFIDENTIAL    
error for multiple comparisons between active and placebo arms for the primary 
endpoint.  The secondary endpoints percent change from baseline in Lp(a) at week 48, 
in ApoB and LDL -C at week 36 and 48 will be analyzed similarly as the primary 
endpoint.  Safety endpoints will be summarized descriptively.  
Baseline Lp(a) is defined as the mean of the two most recent non -missing Lp(a) values 
measured through central lab pri or to or on study day 1.  If for any reason only 1 value is 
available then that value will be used as baseline.  
For a full description of statistical analysis methods, please refer to Section  9. 
Statistical Hypotheses  
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between olpasiran and placebo in 
percent change from baseline in  Lp(a) at week 36 in subjects with atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease and with elevated Lp(a).

2. Introduction  
2.1 Study Rationale  
Study  20180109 is a double -blind, randomized, multicenter dose finding study in 
subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]).  
The primary objective is to test olpasiran administered subcutaneous (SC) once every 
12 weeks (Q12W) compared with placebo on percent change from baseline in Lp(a) 
after 36  weeks of treatment.  Additionally, an exploratory dose of 225 mg once every 
24 weeks (Q24W) will be evaluated.  The treatment period is [ADDRESS_325994] administered at week  36.  After t he week  48 
treatment period there will be  an extended safety follow -up for a minimum  
of 24 weeks.   
Olpasiran is being developed for the treatment of patients with atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease and elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular events.  Lp(a) reductions of  80 from baseline are anticipated with 
olpasiran and it is expected that this level of reduction in Lp(a) may result in clinically 
meaningful cardiovascular benefit in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(Kamstrup et al, 2009, Burgess et al, 2018, Lamina et al, 2019, Madsen et al, 2020).    
Available data from the initial cohorts of the first in human (FIH) study has shown the 
following:  
 Olpasiran can effectively lower Lp(a) levels.  
 Pharmacodynamic (PD) effects last up to at least 3  months.  
 At single doses up to 225  mg (cohort  7), olpasira n was tolerated with no safety 
concerns identified as of day  225. 
The olpasiran target population is patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
and significantly elevated Lp(a).  All patients will be receiving optimized standard of care 
for other  cardiovascular risk factors, including elevated low -density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL -C), but still be at risk for cardiovascular events from high Lp(a) levels.  
The Lp(a) cutoff of 150  nmol/L is based on the epi[INVESTIGATOR_267726](a)  125 nmol/L is considered elevated from the general population data 
(Averna et al, 2017; Nordestgaard and Langsted, 2016; Ohro -Melander, 2015; 
Leebmann et al, 2013).  In addition, based on the degree of absolute Lp(a) reduction 
necessary to demonstrate a corresponding effect on cardiovascular events, the enrolled 
population would need to have high baseline Lp(a).  Therefore, an enrollment criterion of

Protocol Number:  20180109  
Date:  02 May  2022 Page 19 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Lp(a)  150 nmol/L would result in a study population with a median Lp(a) of 
approximately 2 00 nmol/L and allows evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of 
olpasiran in subjects with very high Lp(a).  
A recent Mendelian randomization study suggests that in individuals with very high 
baseline Lp(a) concentrations, reducing Lp(a) by 80  to 90 is expected to translate 
into a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events  
(Khan et al, 2017; Leebmann  et al, 2013; Safarova et al, 2013, Burgess et al, 2018, 
Lamina et al, 2019, Madsen et al, 2020).  
2.2 Background  
2.2.1 Disease  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_267727], including smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_125270], 
cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, 
acco unting for approximately 31  of all deaths according to the World Health 
Organisation (WHO, 2014).  Furthermore, after a cardiovascular event, patients may 
suffer from both acute and long -term reductions in health -related quality of life, including 
diminis hed mobility and functionality, as well as anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sexual 
dysfunction (Bach et al, 2011; Schweikert et al, 2009; Brink et al, 2005; 
Simpson  and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_63772], 2003; Mendes de Leon et al, 1998).  
While lipid -lowering therapy research has h istorically focused on LDL -C to reduce 
cardiovascular risk, epi[INVESTIGATOR_267728](a) as a strong 
independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (Kassner et al, 2015; 
Willeit et al, 2014; Kamstrup et al, 20 13; Jacobson, 2013; Dubé et al, 2012; 
Emerging  Risk Factors Collaboration, 2009; Kamstrup et al, 2009; Bennet et al, 2008; 
Kamstrup  et al, 2008; Danik et al, 2006).  Elevated plasma Lp(a) levels have also been 
associated with atherosclerotic disease severi ty and progression (Kotani et al, 2017; 
Poller et al, 2015; Stather et al, 2014; Guler et al, 2013; Ronald et al, 2011; 
Gardener  et al, 2009; Habib et al, 2009; Takagi et al,  2009; Schillinger et al, 2002).  
The physiological function of Lp(a) is unclear, b ut Lp(a) has been shown to have a 
pathogenic role in atherosclerosis and thrombosis formation 
(Nordestgaard  and Langsted, 2016).  The connection between Lp(a) levels and coronary 
artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, a nd aortic 
valve stenosis has been described in several genetic and observational studies 
Product:  Olpasiran  
Protocol Number:  20180109  
Date:  02 May  2022 Page 20 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL    
(Schmidt  et al, 2016).  It has been noted that this risk relationship is continuous and 
becomes proportionally more impactful with higher Lp(a) levels.  The associatio n 
persists after correction for other lipid parameters (Emerging Risk Factors 
Collaboration,  2009).  
Elevated Lp(a) has varying definitions depending upon the population under study and 
the assay being used.  Some studies have estimated that 20  to 30 of the population 
have Lp(a)  50 mg/dL (Varvel et al, 2016; Nordestgaard et al, 2010).  The American 
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Cholesterol guidelines 
further state that  if a decision is made to measure Lp(a), an Lp(a)   50 mg/dL 
or   125 nmol/L, may be considered a risk enhancing factor (Grundy et al, 2019).  The 
National Lipid Association suggest that Lp(a)  50 mg/dL ( 100 nmol/L) be considered 
the elevated risk threshold (Wilson et al, 2019); the Canadian Cardiovascular S ociety 
states that levels  30 mg/dL are considered elevated (Anderson et al, 2016); and a 
study in the Chinese Han observed increasing risk at  17 mg/dL (Cui et al, 2018).  The 
prevalence of Lp(a)  50 mg/dL ( 125 nmol/L) varies by [CONTACT_267754] 30  in Africa; 25  in South  Asia; 20 in Europe, Oceania, and North 
America; 15  in South America; and 10  in Asia (Tsimikas et al, 2018).  The risk for the 
development of significant coronary artery disease appears to be increased with p lasma 
Lp(a) levels as low as 30  mg/dL in European populations, and the risk of myocardial 
infarction is elevated by 2 - to 3.5 -fold in individuals with elevated Lp(a) levels 
(Norderstgaard and Langstedt, 2016; Kamstrup et al, 2009).  
The ESC/EAS dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_267729](a) measurement should be 
considered at least once in each adult’s lifetime (Mach et al, 2020).  American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol guidelines state that 
Lp(a) is a modified form of LDL -C that appears to possess atherogenic potential.  
Indications for its measurement are a family history of premature atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease or personal history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease not 
explained by [CONTACT_267755] (Gr undy et al, 2019).  Recommendations for measuring 
Lp(a) levels in adults have also been added to guidelines or scientific statements from 
the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, the National Lipid Association, and HEART [LOCATION_006] 
(Anderson  et al, 2016; Wilson  et al, 2019; Cegla et al, 2019).   
High plasma Lp(a) concentration is genetically defined, remains at stable levels, cannot 
be controlled by [CONTACT_267756] (diet, exercise, or other environmental factors), and 
is not effectively controlled by [CONTACT_267757].  
Currently, there are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_267730](a).  Approaches to lower Lp(a) include use of proprotein

CONFIDENTIAL    
convertase subtilisin/kexin typ e 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, niacin, or mipomersen 
(Santos  et al, 2015; Yeang et al, 2015; Landray et  al, 2014), which decrease Lp(a) 
moderately.  While lipoprotein apheresis is effective in lowering Lp(a), it is currently used 
only in a few countries with limi ted access (Julius, 2018).  In addition, it is an invasive, 
very expensive procedure requiring frequent visits, which makes it unfeasible as a long -
term treatment for subjects who need lifelong therapy (Khan et al, 2017; Roeseler et al, 
2016; Leebmann et a l, 2013; Safarova et al, 2013).  
Therefore, novel agents that lower high Lp(a) concentrations are being investigated to 
confer additional protection against cardiovascular disease.  Although definitive evidence 
that the reduction in plasma Lp(a) will provid e cardiovascular risk reduction is lacking, 
Mendelian randomization epi[INVESTIGATOR_29820], lipoprotein apheresis cohort results, 
and experimental data suggest a causal role for elevated Lp(a) (Averna et al, 2017; 
Nordestgaard and Langsted, 2016; Ohro -Melan der, 2015; Leebmann et al, 2013) and 
provide the rationale for exploring the therapeutic concept.  
2.2.[ADDRESS_325995] Background:  Olpasiran  
Small interfering (also called short interfering) RNA molecules (siRNA) are synthetic 
RNA duplexes that d isrupt the expression of specific genes with complementary 
nucleotide sequences by [CONTACT_267758], preventing translation 
(Agrawal et al, 2003).  The serum pharmacokinetics in [COMPANY_010]’s nonclinical program 
support fast clearance from the blood compartment and effective delivery to liver due to 
GalNAc conjugation via the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). Olpasiran is a fully 
chemically modified siRNA, and is therefore, slowly degraded by [CONTACT_267759] - and 
exo-nucleases in the liver (Nair et al, 2017).  
Uptake of the siRNA into cells involves endocytosis and release from the endosome to 
the cytosol, a mechanism that is not currently well understood.  Once in the cytosol, the 
antisense (guiding) strand of the siRNA double strand is loaded into an RN A-induced 
silencing complex (RISC), while the other one is degraded.  The loaded RISC is then 
directed to an mRNA which has complementary sequence of the guide strand.  
Argonaute proteins present in RISC cleave the target mRNA, which is then further 
degrad ed by [CONTACT_267760].  Dissociation of the target mRNA strand from RISC after the 
cleavage allow more mRNA to be silenced, enabling continual degradation of target 
mRNA and leading to efficient and potent gene silencing (Agrawal et al, 2003).  Small 
interfer ing RNA molecules can also be targeted for uptake in select tissues via 
conjugation of the siRNA to high -affinity antibody or antibody fragments, nucleic acids, or 
receptor ligands to bind to cell surface receptors and to mediate cell -specific uptake.

CONFIDENTIAL    
Targeted uptake has the advantages of being effective at a lower dose and may confer 
reduced toxicity from uptake and knockdown in unintended tissues.  In particular, SC 
administration of siRNAs conjugated to trivalent N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), which 
mediates hepatocyte uptake through the hepatocyte -restricted ASGPR in liver -targeted, 
durable gene knockdown (Wittrup  and Lieberman, 2015).  
Olpasiran is an siRNA designed to target the mRNA transcribed from the LPA gene, 
which encodes apo(a) protein in liver  cells.  Thus, olpasiran is able to specifically knock 
down hepatic Lp(a) production.  The siRNA molecule is formed by [CONTACT_267761] -strands of RNA with 21 consecutive complementary 
base pairs.  
Pharmacology  
[COMPANY_010]’s  nonclinical program showed that olpasiran can achieve a sustained  80 
reduction in plasma Lp(a).  The studies supporting this conclusion included efficacy data 
collected from transgenic mice and cynomolgus monkeys demonstrating that Lp(a) 
levels can be specifically targeted with olpasiran to inhibit apo(a) translation.   
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of olpasiran 
is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Elevated plasma Lp(a) has been identified as a strong independent risk factor for the 
development and progression of atherosclerotic disease (Ellis et al, 2017).  Lp(a) has 
been associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction, aortic valve stenosis 
development, carotid art ery stenosis and abdominal aorta aneurism progression.  High 
plasma Lp(a) concentration is genetically defined, cannot be controlled by [CONTACT_267762]-reducing medicatio ns.  Therefore, the development of a novel agent to lower high 
Lp(a) concentrations is a valid approach to confer additional protection against 
cardiovascular disease.  Although definitive evidence that the reduction in plasma Lp(a) 
will provide cardiovasc ular risk reduction is not yet available, mendelian randomization 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_29820], plasma apheresis cohort results, and experimental data suggest 
a causal role for elevated Lp(a) (Averna et al, 2017; Nordestgaard and Langsted, 2016; 
Ohro -Melander, 20 15) and provide the rationale for exploring the therapeutic concept.   
There are no identified risks for olpasiran and potential risks are limited to liver enzyme 
elevation and hypersensitivity reactions.  Other events of interest for olpasiran, that have 
not been borne out either by [CONTACT_11339] -clinical or available clinical data, but that are based

Protocol Number:  20180109  
Date:  02 May  2022 Page 23 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL    
on the siRNA/oligotherapeutics platform include:  effects on platelets and coagulation, 
immune inflammatory response, and peripheral neuropathy.  Additionally, ver y low levels 
of Lp(a) have been associated with increased incidence of type 2 diabetes, but whether 
pharmacologic lowering of Lp(a) would be associated with an increased risk for 
development of type 2 diabetes is unknown (Paige et al, 2017; Ye et al, 2014) .  These 
risks have not been borne out by [CONTACT_267763] -clinical data or clinical data to date for 
olpasiran.   
All study subjects will be closely monitored and frequently assessed for adverse events 
throughout the study.  The laboratory safety monitoring  includes evaluation of routine 
chemistry (including liver function tests and renal function), hematology, HbA1c, and 
coagulation assessments.  Potential anaphylactic reactions will be assessed by [CONTACT_267764] 
(Sampson  et al, 2006) and reported accordingly on the adverse event electronic case 
report form (eCRF).  If Sampson criteria are positive, the potential anaphylactic reaction 
will be confirmed by [CONTACT_267765] n 30 minutes of symptoms, 
if feasible.  Bioanalytical testing for anti-olpasiran antibodies will be conducted only if 
there are unexpected PD findings or a safety signal in this study or future studies that 
warrants further investigation.  
[COMPANY_010] has been cl osely monitoring the evolving Coronavirus disease -19 (COVID -19) 
pandemic around the globe.  As part of this effort, [COMPANY_010] has performed a rigorous 
assessment, in discussion with study investigators, considering the study design, patient 
safety, public heal th risk, risk -benefit ratio, as well as the burden on country healthcare 
systems.  Given the safety concerns around COVID -[ADDRESS_325996]:  Olpasiran

4. Study Design  
4.1 Overall Design  
This is a phase 2, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, multicenter, dose 
finding study to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olpasiran on Lp(a) compared 
to placebo in subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and with eleva ted 
Lp(a).   
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following 5  treatment groups 
(some olpasiran arms will include placebo to maintain blind):  
 Group 1:  10 mg Q12W  
 Group 2:  75 mg Q12W  
 Group 3:  225 mg Q12W  
 Group 4:  225 mg Q24W  
 Group  5:  Placebo Q12W  
The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_236478](a)  200 vs.  200 nmol/L and by 
[CONTACT_11338] (Japan vs. Non -Japan).  
The study treatment period is [ADDRESS_326001] of 
care (including stable lipid -altering therapy) per their local guidelines during the 
treatment period and extended  safety follow -up period.  
An interim analysis will be performed when approximately [ADDRESS_326002]:  Olpasiran  
Protocol Number:  20180109  
Date:  [ADDRESS_326003] access to unblinded 
information until the study is formally ended at EOS (as defined in Section 4.4.1), 
database is locked, and the snapshot is taken for final analysis . 
The overall study design is described by a study schema in Section 1.2.  The endpoints 
are defined in Section 3. 
4.2 Number of Subjects  
Approximately 290 subjects will be enrolled in the study, with approximately 58  subjects 
per treatment arm.  
Subjects in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.  For the sample 
size justification, see Section 9.2. 
4.2.[ADDRESS_326004] dose ranges were selected based on available data from phase  1 
Study  20170544 and the additional following considerations:  
Product:  Olpasiran  
Protocol Number:  20180109  
Date:  02 May  2022 Page 28 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL    
 General understanding of safety regarding oligonucleotide -based therapeutics, ie, 
antisense oligonucleotide and siRNA therapeutics and their mechanism of action.  
 Lp(a) reductions of  80 from baseline are being targeted because this level of 
reduction is anticipated to be required to observe cardiovascular benefit in patients 
with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  
 Olpasiran PK/PD modelling and simulation results based on data from 
Study 20170544 indicate that:  
 A low dose of 10 mg administered Q12W will provide target (  80) Lp(a) 
suppression in approximately half (42 ) of subjects with baseline 
Lp(a)   150 nmol/L by [CONTACT_24473] 12.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_267731](a)  reductions from 
baseline of appr oximately  77 at months 6 and 12, only 41  and 64 of these 
subjects will achieve Lp(a) values of  50 nmol/L by [CONTACT_24473] 12.  Therefore, the 
10 mg dose will provide additional PK and Lp(a) data within the lower dynamic 
range of the olpasiran exposure -respons e relationship and help support selection 
of the phase 3 dose in the target patient population.  
 An intermediate dose of 75 mg administered Q12W was selected as it is 
anticipated to provide target (80 ) Lp(a) suppression from baseline within 2 to 
3 doses in  the majority (94 ) of subjects by [CONTACT_24473]  12.  Furthermore, 
approximately 90  of subjects are expected to achieve Lp(a)  50 nmol/L, which 
may support selection of this dose for phase 3 evaluation.  
 A high dose of 225 mg Q12W is expected to provide a similar  degree of Lp(a) 
suppression (  80) in the majority of subjects (98 ), but with a greater 
proportion of subjects (96 ) achieving reductions of Lp(a)  50 nmol/L by 
[CONTACT_24473]  12.  Given that the magnitude and durability of Lp(a) suppression appears 
to increase with dose, the 225  mg dose will also provide greater magnitudes of 
Lp(a) suppression with multiple dosing.  
 A frequency of Q12W dosing was selected for  the above doses based on the 
durability of Lp(a) response over time and to ensure target suppression levels are 
maintained throughout the entire dosing interval in the majority (  90) of subjects 
with elevated Lp(a) levels  150 nmol/L.  
 A dose of 225 mg administered Q24W will also be evaluated in this study to explore 
opportunities for less frequent (Q24W) dosing in this patient population and to 
assess Lp(a) lowering impact throughout the [ADDRESS_326005] that 225 mg Q24W dosing will 
result in median Lp(a) reductions from baseline of 88  and with approximately 74  
of subjects achieving Lp(a) levels  50 nmol/L.

Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44810].  If this occurs, the 
investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation 
from investigational product or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_54492] (se e Table 1 -1) 
including di fferent options of follow -up (eg, in person, by [CONTACT_648]/mail, through 
family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other treating physicians, from the 
review of medical records) and collection of data, including endpoints, adverse events, 
and must do cument this decision in the subject’s medical records.  Subjects who have 
discontinued investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_267740].  Whenever safe and 
feasible, it is imp erative that subjects remain on -study to ensure safety surveillance

designee must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_1155] (where possible, 
[ADDRESS_326032]’s last known 
mailing address or local equivalent methods).  These contact [CONTACT_155980]’s medical record.  
 If the subject continues to be unreachable, he/she w ill be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up.  
 For subjects who are lost to follow -up, the investigator can search publicly available 
records where permitted  to ascertain survival status.  This ensures that the data 
set(s) produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.  
8. Study Assessments and Procedures  
Study procedures and their time points are summarized in the Schedule of Activities 
(see Table 1 -1).  
As protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed if an enrolled subject is subsequently 
determined to be ineligible for the study, this must be discussed with the sponsor 
immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject is to continue or 
discontin ue study treatment.  
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule 
of Activities, is essential and required for study conduct.  
8.1 General Study Periods  
8.1.1 Screening, Enrollment, and/or Randomization  
Informed consent must be  obtained before completing any screening procedure or 
discontinuation of standard therapy for any disallowed therapy.  After the subject has 
signed the ICF, the site will register the subject in the IRT and screen the subject in 
order to assess eligibilit y for participation.  The screening window is up to 28 days 
(4 weeks) and all activities shown in the Schedule of Activities for screening must be 
completed in this time period.  
Product:  Olpasiran  
Protocol Number:  20180109  
Date:  [ADDRESS_326033] a fasting 
Lp(a)   150 nmol/L confirmed during screening.  This serum sample needs to be 
collected after informed consent is obtained but prior to treatment start (see 
Section  8.2.9 ).  Diagnoses of coronary artery disease, atherosclerotic cerebrovascular 
disease, or peripheral arterial disease are expected to be consistent with locally 
applicable professional society gui delines.  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
subjects meet all eligibility criteria.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all subjects screened and to confirm eligibility or rec ord reasons for 
screening failure, (see Section 5.5) as applicable.  
If a subject has not met all eligibility criteria at the end of the screening period, the 
subject will be registered as a screen fail.  Screen fail subjects may be eligible for 
re-screening 1 time if t hey failed criteria other than elevated Lp(a).  
Rescreen subjects must first be registered as screen failures in IRT and subsequently 
registered as rescreens.  Once the subject is registered as rescreened, a new 28-day 
(4 week) screening window will begin.   Subjects will retain the same subject identification 
number assigned at the original screening and must complete all screening 
assessments, except for the retesting of Lp(a).  If the rescreening period begins more 
than [ADDRESS_326034] be repeated.  
8.1.2 Treatment Period  
Visits will occur per the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1 -1).  On -study visits may be 
completed within  3 day, aside from Day  2 visit which may be completed  [ADDRESS_326035] -dose PK samples are being collected.  
Telemedicine, paper PRO completion, and home healthcare visits may be implemente d 
at randomization/day  [ADDRESS_326036]’s, site’s, and

possible number of visits should occur outside the clinic, and visits should return to 
“in-clinic” at the earliest possible opportunity.  
Subjects that withdraw from study treatment should continue with on -study visits (see 
Section  7.1 for more details).  If a subject withdraws from the study early, all efforts 
should be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to 
the date of withdra wal.  The procedures for the EOS visit should be completed at the 
time of withdrawal (Section 8.1.4 ). 
8.1.3 Extended Safety Follow -up 
Visits will occur per the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1 -1).  Extended Safety Follow -up 
visits should be completed within  [ADDRESS_326037] withdraws from the study early, all efforts should be made to complete and 
report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal.  The

[IP_ADDRESS] Medical History  
The Investigator or designee will collect a complete medical history that st arted or was 
ongoing within [ADDRESS_326039]'s concurrent medical conditions.  In addition to the medical 
history above, the following should be collected back to the date of original diagnosis:  
 cardiovascular history, including details of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 
elevated Lp(a)  
 history of cancer and/or malignancy  
 history of immunologic or chronic inflammatory disease  
 history of hepatobiliary dysfunction (i ncluding asymptomatic and/or transient liver 
function test abnormalities)

 history of non -stroke related neurological findings (eg, peripheral neuropathy)  
 history of platelet disorder or coagulopathy  
 diabetes mellitus history including, but not limited to, duration and complications 
(eg, acute metabolic complications, retinopathy, neuropathy)  
 familial history of diabetes mellitus  
 familial history of cardiac disorder  
Record all findings on the medical h istory CRF.  The current severity will be collected for 
each condition that has not resolved.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination  
Physical examination will be performed as per standard of care.  Physical examination 
findings should be recorded on the appropriate CRF (eg , medical history, event).  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_326040] include the following assessments:  
 muscle mass and tone, presence of tremor, fasciculation or paralysis  
 strength in all extremities, including proximal and distal muscular groups  
 gait, by [CONTACT_267773] a short regular walk, heel and toe walk  
 symmetry of sensitivity to pressure (dull tool), temperature and pain (sharp tool)  
 proprioception in upper and lower extremities  
 symmetry of reflexes assessed on the upper extremities (biceps, triceps and 
brachioradial) and lower extremities (patellar and achilles)

Date:  [ADDRESS_326041] for a complete neurologic or 
musculoskeletal assessment. The identified neurologic or musculoskelet al abnormality is 
to be reported on the adverse Events CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Measurements  
Height in centimeters should be measured without shoes.  Weight in kilograms should 
be measured without shoes.  
Waist circumference:  Subjects should wear minimal clothing to  ensure that the 
measuring tape is correctly positioned.  Subjects should stand erect with the abdomen 
relaxed, arms at the sides, feet together and with their weight equally divided over both 
legs.  To perform the waist measurement, the lowest rib margin is first located and 
marked.  The iliac crest is then palpated in the midaxillary line, and also marked.  It is 
recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally midway between the lowest rib 
margin and the iliac crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in p osition around the abdomen 
about the level of the umbilicus.  The elastic tape thus defines the level of the waist 
circumference, which can then be measured by [CONTACT_267774].  Subjects are asked to breathe normally, a nd to breathe out gently at the 
time of the measurement to prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding 
their breath.  Measurements should be performed using the same procedure throughout 
the study.  The reading is taken to the nearest centi meter or 1/2 inch and entered in the 
source document.  
8.2.2 Efficacy Assessments  
Planned time points for all efficacy assessments are listed in the Schedule of Activities 
see ( Table 1 -1).  Serum Lp(a), LDL -C, and ApoB will be collected with other clinical 
laboratory assessments describe d in Section 8.2.5 . 
8.2.3 Safety Assessments  
Planned time points for all safety assessments are listed in the Schedule of Activities 
see ( Table 1 -1). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
The following measurements must be performed:  systolic/diastolic blood pressure and 
heart rate.  Subject must be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_33197] a rested and calm state for at least

[IP_ADDRESS] Survival Status  
Survival status should be obtained for all subjects within the limits of local law.   
This includes subjects who withdraws consent, or subjects considered lost to 
follow-up, or subjects unwilling to continue schedule of assessments  and should 
include interrogation of medical, national, and public databases, if necessary.   If 
deceased, the date and reported cause of death should be obtained . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
Subject must be in supi[INVESTIGATOR_33197] a rested and calm state for at least [ADDRESS_326044]'s source documents.  At the request of the 
sponsor, a copy of the original ECG will be made available to [COMPANY_010].  Findings should 
be recorded on the ECG eCRF.

Section 11.4.  The investigator will submit any updated serious adverse event data to the 
sponsor within 24  hours of it being available.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_326047],  
then these  serious adverse events will be  reported to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following 
the investigator’s awareness of the event  using the Serious Adverse Event 
Contingency Form. 
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases and handled accordingly based 
on relationship to investigational product.  
If further safety related data is needed to fulfill any regulatory reporting 
requirements for a reportable event, then additional information may need to be 
collected from the subject’s records after the subject ends the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Eve nts 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious 
adverse events.  Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the subject is the 
preferred method to inquire about adverse event  occurrence.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial adverse event/serious adverse event report, the investigator is required to 
proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts.  All adverse events and 
serious adverse events will be followed u ntil resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3).  
Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Section 11.4. 
All new information for previously reported serious adverse events must be sent to

[IP_ADDRESS] Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
If subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21889] a 
serious adverse event,  this information must be submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_54547] a study trea tment under clinical investigation are met.  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical 
investigation.  The sponsor will comply wit h country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/IECs, and investigators.  
Individual safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory r equirements and sponsor policy and forwarded 
to investigators as necessary.  
An investigator who receives an individual safety report describing a serious adverse 
event or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of serious adverse 
events) from the sponsor will file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify 
the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.   
To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment 
assignment of subje cts who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
may be unblinded by [CONTACT_21960].  Aggregate 
analyses may also be unblinded by [CONTACT_54548], as appropriate.  
Investigators will receive noti fication of related serious adverse events reports sent to 
regulatory authorities in accordance with local requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Monitoring Plan  
Subject safety will be routinely monitored as defined in [COMPANY_010]’s safety surveillance and 
signal management proce sses.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy and Lactation  
Details of all pregnancies and/or lactation in female subjects and pregnancy details for 
female partners of male subjects  will be collected after the start of study treatment and 
until [ADDRESS_326049] dose of study drug . 
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator is to inform [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours of learning 
of the pregnancy and/or lactation and is to follow the procedures outlined in

additional informati on that may be requested.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, and ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events.  
Further details regarding pregnancy and lactation are provided in Section 11.5. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_326050] of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the 
Schedule of Activities ( Table 1 -1) for the timing  and frequency.  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and recording any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the Event s CRF.  The 
investigator must determine whether an abnormal value in an individual s tudy subject 
represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, 
abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's 
judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events.  However, l aboratory value 
changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse 
events.  Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be 
recorded as the adverse event.  
All protocol -required laboratory a ssessments, as defined in Section 11.2, must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and  the Schedule of Activities 
(Table 1 -1).  
Laboratory/analyte results that could unblind the study will not be reported to 
investigative sites or other blinded personnel until the study has been formally unblinded.  
In order to protect the blinding of the double -blind treatment pe riod, the following labs will 
be blinded to the [COMPANY_010] study team and site staff after day 1 until the study has been 
formally unblinded, and will not be reported to sites:   
 Serum Lp(a)  
 Lipid panel (see Appendix [ADDRESS_326051] of analytes)  
 high sensitivity C -reactive protein (hs -CRP)  
 high sensitivity Interleukin 6 (hs-IL-6) 
 anti-olpasiran  antibodies  
 ApoA1  
 ApoB

Protocol Number:  20180109  
Date:  [ADDRESS_326052]’s medical care should not perform non -protocol testing of these analy tes 
during a subject’s study participation and until the end of the study, to prevent unblinding 
the patient and site to the treatment assignment, except when it is medically necessary.  
If a local lipid panel is drawn, all reasonable steps must be underta ken to avoid informing 
the subject and study personnel of the results.   
If triglycerides are  1000  mg/dL (11.3  mmol/L) at any scheduled assessment, the 
investigator will be informed, and a fasting triglyceride repeat test will be requested.  If 
the retes t confirms triglycerides  1000  mg/dL (11.3  mmol/L), the [COMPANY_010] medical 
monitor and the investigator will be informed so that appropriate medical follow up for the 
subject can be initiated.  
Pregnancy Testing  
A highly sensitive (serum) pregnancy test should be completed at screening and a 
screening urine pregnancy test should be completed the day of initiation of 
investigational product (prior to dosing) for females of childbearing potential.   
Note:  Females who have undergone a bilateral tubal ligation/occl usion should have 
pregnancy testing per protocol requirements.  (If a female subject, or the partner of a 
male subject , becomes pregnant it must be reported on the Pregnancy Notification 
Form, see  Figure 11 -2).  Refer to Section 11.[ADDRESS_326053] should be performed for 
confirmation.  
Additional on -treatment pregnancy testing may be performed at the investigator’s 
discretion or as required per local laws and regulations.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_326054] PK samples asses sed. 
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations of olpasiran  
as specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1 -1 and Table 1 -2).  Instructions for the

analyses may be performed.  These optional pharmacogenetic analyses focus on 
inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the disease and/or 
responsiveness to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44809].  The goals of the optional studies 
include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation of cardiovascular diseases 
and/or to identify subjects who may have positive or neg ative response to olpasiran.  No 
additional samples are collected for this part of the study.  For subjects who consent to 
this/these analysis/analyses, DNA may be extracted from residual cell pellets retained 
from selected biomarker plasma blood draws.  
The final disposition of samples will be described in Section  11.6.  
8.2.8 Antibody Testing Procedures  
Blood s ample(s) for antibody testing are to be collected according to the time points 
specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1 -1).  Bioanalytical testing for anti -olpasiran  
antibodies will be conducted on these samples only if there are unexpected PD findings 
or antibody -related safety concerns in this study.  Samples testing positive may be 
further characterized.  Additional blood samples may be obtained to rule out anti -drug 
antibodies during the study.  
Subjects who test positive for binding antibodies at the final antibody -scheduled time 
point and have clinical sequelae that are considered potentially related to an 
anti-olpasiran  antibody response may also be asked to retu rn for additional follow -up 
testing.

primary PROMIS domains (physical function, fatigue, pain, emotional distress, and 
social health) and general health perceptions that cut across domains. The first seven 
items d o not use a specific recall period, and the last three items have a recall period of 
“the past seven days”.  The first nine items of the PROMIS Global Health use a five -point 
Likert -type scale. Response options for the first six items (Global 01 to 05 and Global 09) 
range from “Excellent”, corresponding to a score of 5 to “Poor”, corresponding to a score 
of 1; response options for item 7 (Global 06) ranged from “Completely”, corresponding to 
a score of 5 to “Not at all”, corresponding to a score of 1; respo nse options for item 8 
(Global 10) ranged from “Never”, corresponding to a score of 5 to “Always”, 
corresponding to a score of 1; and response options for item 9 (Global 08) ranged from 
“None”, corresponding to a score of 5 to “Very severe”, corresponding to a score of 1. 
Item 10 (Global 07) uses an 11 -point numeric rating scale with 0 corresponding to “No 
pain” and 10 corresponding to “Worst pain imaginable”.  The PROMIS Global Health

Up to a total of approximately 290  subjects may be enrolled to accommodate individual 
country -specific enrollment requirements.  
9.3 Analysis Sets, Subgroups, and Covariates  
9.3.1 Analysis Sets  
Full Analysis Sets (FAS):  FAS includes all randomized subjects who received at least 
one dose of investigational product and will be used to perform the efficacy analysis 
based on randomized treatment group.  
For safety analysis, FAS will be used based on the actual treatment rece ived.  
9.3.2 Covariates  
Baseline covariates include, but are not limited to:  
 Stratification factors  
 Screening Lp(a) (  200 nmol/L vs.  200 nmol/L)

9.3.4 Handling of Missing and Incomplete Data  
All attempts will be made to capture missing or partial data for this trial prior to the data 
lock.  The frequency and pattern of missing data for efficacy endpoints will be assessed 
through descript ive summaries of the measurements over time.  
Details on the imputation rules for partial dates relating to adverse events, concomitant 
medications and historical events are provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  
9.[ADDRESS_326060] vers ion of the SAP will be developed and finalized before the snapshot of the 
primary analysis.  Below is a summary of the timing and methods for the planned 
statistical analyses.  The final analysis will be conducted and reported following the 
EOS, as defined  in Section 4.4.1 . 
9.4.1 Planned Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Administrative Interim Analyses for Efficacy  
An interim analysis will be performed when approximately [ADDRESS_326061] early terminated.   The study continues regardless of the 
administrative interim results.  
Interim analysis results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_267776] (IARSC)  which consists of internal experts, who are independent of the study 
team.  Further detail regarding the interim analysis process in protecting trial integrity will 
be provided by [CONTACT_267777].

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis  
Primary analysis will be p erformed when all randomized subjects have had the 
opportunity to complete the week  [ADDRESS_326062] of the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] End of Treatment Period Analysis  
The end of treatment period analysis will be performed when all randomized subj ects 
have had the opportunity to complete week  [ADDRESS_326063] access to unblinded 
information until the study is formally ended  at EOS (as defined in  Section 4.4.1), 
database is locked, and the snapshot is taken for final analysis.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Final Analysis  
Final analysis will be performed when all randomized subjects either complete the 
extended safety follow -up and ended the study or early terminate from the study.  At that 
time, the database related to the final analysis will be cleaned, processed and the 
database will be locked.  All efficacy and safety analyses during the extended follow -up 
period will be pe rformed.  
9.4.2 Methods of Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS] General Considerations  
Unless specified otherwise, efficacy analyses will be performed on the FAS by 
[CONTACT_21964], and safety analyses will be performed on the FAS by 
[CONTACT_266142].  
All categorical variables will be summarized using the number and percent of subjects 
and all continuous variables will be summarized using mean, standard error or standard 
deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and number of subjects with observations. 
Analysis of explorat ory endpoints will be specified in SAP.

Baseline Lp(a) is defined as the mean of the two most recent non -missing Lp(a) values 
measured through central lab prior to or on study day 1.  If for any reason only 1 value is 
availabl e, then that value will be used as baseline.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Analyses  
Endpoint  Statistical Analysis Methods  
Primary The analysis of percent change from baseline in Lp(a) at week [ADDRESS_326064]  squares means (LS means) by 
[CONTACT_267778] (olpasiran - placebo) based on 
the model above will be summarized.  The Hochberg procedure will be used 
to control the type I error for multiple comparisons between active and 
placeb o arms.  
A sensitivity analysis will be performed using multiple imputation to impute 
missing data.  Details of the imputation rules for the sensitivity analysis will be 
provided in the SAP.  
Additional analysis of the primary endpoint will be explored using  Multiple 
Comparison Procedure - Modelling (MCP -Mod) methodology  
(Bretz et al, 2005).  Details will be provided in the SAP.  
Secondary  Analysis of the secondary endpoints will be performed when all randomized 
subjects have had opportunity to complete week  [ADDRESS_326065] 
early terminated.  
Analysis of the secondary endpoints (including percent change from baseline 
at week 36 in ApoB and LDL -C, and percent change from baseline at 
week  48 in ApoB, Lp(a) and LDL -C) will be performed similarly to the analysis 
of the primary endpoint.  
Exploratory  Will be described in the statistical analysis plan finalized before database lock  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_326066], and 
significant treatment emergent adverse events will also be provided.

data would not be expected to be useful for meta -analysis with data from other trials.

11.3 Appendix 3.  Study Governance Considerations  
Clinical Events, Interim Analysis Review Steering, and Data Review Team 
Committee(s)  
Clinical Events Committee  
Deaths and major cardiovascular events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_267781], using standardized definitions.  Adjudication will include, but 
may not be limited, to the following events:  
 death by [CONTACT_55544]  
 cardiovascular death  
 myocardial infarction  
 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267745]  
 coronary revascularization  
 stroke  
 transient ischemic attack  
 cerebrovascular revascularization  
In addition, major adverse limb events (acute limb ischemia, major amputation, or urgent 
peripheral revascularization for ischemia) may a lso be adjudicated.  
Interim Analysis Review Steering Committee  
[COMPANY_010] will use an Interim Analysis Review Steering Committee (IARSC) to review 
accumulating efficacy data from the planned administrative interim analyses of Study 
20180109 to support dose sele ction for a phase 3 registrational  study and trigger early  
planning for the phase 3 program, but will not assess for futility.  The IARSC will be an 
internal group within [COMPANY_010], but external to the relevant study team for olpasiran .  The 
IARSC will follow guidelines outlined in the IARSC  charter.  The charter will set forth the 
governance and responsibilities of the IARSC for olpasiran  Study  20180109.  
It is important to note that the IARSC is separate from the Data Review Team (DRT) , 
described below.  While both are internal [COMPANY_010] committees, the IARSC will review 
accumulating efficacy data and the DRT will review accumulating safety data.    
Data Review Team  
In addition to routine pharmacovigilance monitoring by [CONTACT_11337], an internal un blinded 
DRT will be implemented.  In order to maintain trial integrity, the unblinded data 
reviewed by [CONTACT_267782].   
Product:  Olpasiran  
Protocol Number:  20180109  
Date:  [ADDRESS_326089] 2 with clinical expertise (eg, a member from Clinical 
or Early Development and a member from Global Patient Safety) and a member from 
Global Biostatistical Science.  The DRT will periodically review accumulating d ata from 
the ongoing clinical study to enable prompt identification of serious and unexpected 
suspected adverse reactions to ensure no avoidable increased risk for harm to subjects.  
The DRT will follow the procedures outlined in a charter that will detail  the DRT 
responsibilities and ensure controls are in place to prevent any unintentional unblinding 
of the olpasiran team involved in conduct of the study.  Serious adverse events, adverse 
events of interest, and relevant clinical laboratory test results, w ill be reviewed as well as 
any other available important safety information, as deemed necessary.  The DRT will 
perform unblinded comparisons of event rates in investigational and control groups to 
detect serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions as well as any other safety 
findings that may prompt further actions such as update to the protocol, Investigators’ 
Brochure or Informed Consent Form (ICF).  An ad -hoc DRT may be convened at any 
time for reasons such as a significant and unanticipated safe ty finding.  In accordance 
with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on the safety assessment for 
Investigational new drug (IND) safety reporting (FDA, 2015), identification of any serious 
and unexpected suspected adverse reactions will trigger regu latory safety reporting.  
Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and with:  
 Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the 
Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences International Ethical Guidelines  
 Applicable International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) Guidelines  
 Applicable ICH laws and regulations  
The protocol, protocol amendments, ICF, In vestigator’s Brochure, and other relevant 
documents (eg, subject recruitment advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB/IEC  by 
[CONTACT_267783]/Independent Ethics Committee ( IRB/IEC) .  A copy of the written approval of the 
protocol and informed consent form must be received by [CONTACT_155990].

Protocol Number:  20180109  
Date:  [ADDRESS_326090] submit an d, where 
necessary, obtain approval from the IRB/IEC  for all subsequent protocol amendments 
and changes to the informed consent document.  The investigator must send a copy of 
the approval letter from the IRB/IEC  and amended protocol Investigator’s Signatu re 
page to [COMPANY_010] prior to implementation of the protocol amendment at their site.  
The investigator will be responsible for the following:  
 Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/IEC  annually or 
more frequently in accordance with t he requirements, policies, and procedures 
established by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC 
 Obtaining annual IRB/IEC  approval/renewal throughout the duration of the study.  
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_8268]’s reports and the IRB/IEC  continuance of approval must be 
sent to [COMPANY_010]  
 Notifying the IRB/IEC  of serious adverse events occurring at the site, deviations from 
the protocol or other adverse event reports received from [COMPANY_010], in accordance with 
local procedures  
 Overall conduct of the study at the site and adherence to requiremen ts of Title  21 of 
the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), ICH guidelines, the  IRB/IEC , and all 
other applicable local regulations  
Informed Consent Process  
An initial sample informed consent form is provided for the investigator to prepare the 
informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the sample 
informed consent form are to be communicated formally in writing from the [COMPANY_010]  Trial 
Manager to the investigator.  The written informed consent form is to be prepared in the 
language(s ) of the potential patient population.  
The investigator or his/her delegated representative will explain to the subject, the aims, 
methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study before any 
protocol -specific screening procedures or any in vestigational product(s) is/are 
administered, and answer all questions regarding the study.   
Subjects must be informed that their participation is voluntary.  Subjects will then be 
required to sign a statement of informed consent that meets the requirements of  
[ADDRESS_326091] requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/IEC  or study site.  
The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained 
before the subject was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was 
obtained.  The authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the 
informed consent form.  
Product:  Olpasiran  
Protocol Number:  20180109  
Date:  [ADDRESS_326092] his/her primary care physician informed 
of the subject’s participation in the clinical study unless  it is a local requirement.  The 
investigator shall then inform the primary care physician.  If the subject agrees to such 
notification, the investigator is to inform the subject’s primary care physician of the 
subject’s participation in the clinical study .  If the subject does not have a primary care 
physician and the investigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator is to 
document such in the subject’s medical record.  
The acquisition of informed consent and the subject’s agreement or refusal of his/her 
notification of the primary care physician  is to be documented in the subject’s medical 
records, and the informed consent form is to be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_21966] a legally acceptable representative  and by [CONTACT_267784].  Subject withdrawal of consent or discontinuation from 
study treatment and/or procedures must also be documented in the subject’s medical 
records; refer to Section 7. 
Subjects must be re -consented to the most current version of the informed consent 
form(s) during their participation in the study.  
The original signed in formed consent form is to be retained in accordance with 
institutional policy, and a copy of the informed consent form(s) must be provided to the 
subject.  
If a potential subject is illiterate or visually impaired and does not have a legally 
acceptable rep resentative, the investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the 
informed consent form to the subject and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the 
subject and the witness must sign the informed consent form to attest that informed 
consent  was freely given and understood.  (Refer to ICH GCP guideline, Section  4.8.9 .) 
A subject who is rescreened is not required to sign another informed consent form if the 
rescreening occurs within 30 days from the previous informed consent form signature 
[CONTACT_568]. 
The informed consent form (ICF) will contain a separate section that addresses the use 
of remaining mandatory samples for optional future research.  The investigator or 
authorized designee will explain to each subject the objectives of the future res earch.  
Subjects will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their 
specimens at any time and for any reason during the storage period.  A separate

provide this separate signature.  
Data Protection/Subject Confidentiality  
The investigator must ensure that the subject’s confidentiality is maintained for 
document s submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
Subject will be assigned a unique identifier by [CONTACT_456].  Any subject records or 
datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; subject names 
or any information which would make the subject identifi able will not be transferred.  
On the case report form (CRF) demographics page, in addition to the unique subject 
identification number, include the age at time of enrollment.  
For serious adverse events reported to [COMPANY_010], subjects are to be identified by t heir 
unique subject identification number, initials (for faxed reports, in accordance with local 
laws and regulations), and age (in accordance with local laws and regulations).  
Documents that are not submitted to [COMPANY_010] (eg, signed informed consent forms) a re to 
be kept in confidence by [CONTACT_093], except as described below.  
In compliance with governmental regulations/ICH GCP Guidelines , it is required that the 
investigator and institution permit authorized representatives of the company, of the 
regula tory agency(s), and the IRB/IEC  direct access to review the subject’s original 
medical records for verification of study -related procedures and data.  Direct access 
includes examining, analyzing, verifying, and reproducing any records and reports that 
are important to the evaluation of the study.   
The investigator is obligated to inform and obtain the consent of the subject to permit 
such individuals to have access to his/her study -related records, including personal 
information.  
Publication Policy  
To coor dinate dissemination of data from this study, [COMPANY_010] may facilitate the formation 
of a publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate [COMPANY_010] 
staff, the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter .  
The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to 
collaborate with authors and [COMPANY_010] staff, as appropriate, as defined in the Publication 
Charter.  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and [COMPANY_010] sta ff) does

11.4 Appendix 4.  Safety Events: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  
Definition of Adverse E vent 
Adverse Event Definition  
 An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject 
irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment.   
 Note:  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or 
exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a treatment, combination 
product, medical device or procedure.  
 Note:  Treatment -emergent adverse events will be defined in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments (eg, electrocardiogram, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, that are considered 
clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator  
(ie, not related to progression of underlying disease).  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of  the condition.  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, o r the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
adverse event/serious adverse event unless it is an intentional overdose taken with 
possible suicidal/self -harming intent.  Such overdoses are to be reported 
regardless of sequelae.  
 “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event.  Such instances will be 
captured in the ef ficacy assessments.  However, the signs, symptoms, and/or 
clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as adverse event or 
serious adverse event if they fulfill the definition of an adverse event or serious 
adverse event.  
 
Events NO T Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy):  the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the adverse event.  
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
 
Product:  Olpasiran  
Protocol Number:  20180109  
Date:  [ADDRESS_326096] 1 of the following serious criteria:  
Results in death (fatal)  
Immediately life -threatening  
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267746] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
outpatient setting.  Complications t hat occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155967].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], 
the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary, the adverse event is to be considered serious.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85766] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not 
considered an adverse event.  
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
The term disability means a subs tantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidenta l trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere 
with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other medically important serious event  
Medical or scientific judgment is to be  exercised in deciding whether serious adverse 
event reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267747] [ADDRESS_326097]:  Olpasiran  
Protocol Number:  20180109  
Date:  [ADDRESS_326098]  
The detection and documentation procedures for adverse device effects described in 
this protocol apply to all Non-[COMPANY_010]  medical devices provided for use in the study (see 
Section 6.1.[ADDRESS_326099] of Non-[COMPANY_010]  medical devices).  
Adverse Device Effect Definition  
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a combination 
product or medical device.  Adv erse d evice effects include, but are not limited to, 
adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, adverse 
events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or adverse events resulting from 
use error or from intentional misuse of the device.  
Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording  
 When an adverse event or serious adverse event occurs, it is the responsibility of 
the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], 
laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.  
 The investigator will then record all relevant adverse event/serious adverse event 
information in the Event case report form (CRF).  
 The investigator must assign the fo llowing adverse event attributes:  
o Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or 
symptoms);  
o Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved);  
o Did the event start prior to first dose of investigational product, other 
protocol -required t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_014];  
o Assessment of seriousness;

Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each adverse event and 
serious adverse event reported during the study.  The assessment of severity will be 
based on:   
The [COMPANY_010] Standard Grading Scale as show below:  
Grade  Definition  
MILD  Aware of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
MODERATE  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
SEVEREa Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity  
a An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least [ADDRESS_326100]:  Olpasiran

CONFIDENTIAL    
Assessment of Causality  
 The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational 
product , and/or study -mandated procedure  and each occurrence of each adverse 
event/serious adverse event.  
 Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a relationship 
between investigational product and the event.  
 The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
 Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
 The investigator will als o consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
 For each adverse event/serious adverse event, the investigator must document in 
the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the adverse event/ser ious adverse 
event and has provided an assessment of causality.  
 There may be situations in which a serious adverse event has occurred and the 
investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report.  However, it is 
very important that the inv estigator always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the serious adverse event data.  
 The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send a serious adverse event follow -up report with the updated 
causality assessment.  
 The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
 
Follow-up of Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event  
 The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by 
[CONTACT_54558]/or causality of the adverse event or serious 
adverse event as fu lly as possible.  This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health 
care professionals.  
 If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21889] 
a seri ous adverse event, this information must be submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
 If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_010] with a copy of any post -mortem 
findings including histopatholog y. 
 New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed Event s 
CRF.  
 The investigator will submit any updated serious adverse event data to [COMPANY_010]  
within [ADDRESS_326101]:  Olpasiran

CONFIDENTIAL    
Reporting of Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting via Electronic Data Collection Tool  
 The primary mechanism for reporting serious adverse event will be the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system.  
 If the EDC system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will re port 
the information to [COMPANY_010] using an electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency 
Report Form (also referred to as the electronic Serious Adverse Event (eSAE) 
Contingency Report Form) (see Figure 11 -1) within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.  
 The site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic system as 
soon as it becomes available.  
 After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC system will be taken off -line to 
prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
 If a site rec eives a report of a new serious adverse event from a study subject or 
receives updated data on a previously reported serious adverse event after the 
EDC has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on the paper 
based Serious Adverse E vent Contingency Report Form (see Figure 11 -1). 
 Once the study has ended, serious adverse event(s)  suspected to be related 
to investigational product  will be reported to [COMPANY_010] if the investigator 
becomes aware of a serious adverse event.  The investigator should use the 
paper-based Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form to report the 
event .

Any blood (eg, biomarker, pharmacokinetics [PK])  sample collected according to the 
Schedule of Activities ( Table 1 -1 and Table 1 -2) can be analyzed for any of the tests 
outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to minimize risks to study subjects.  
This incl udes testing to ensure analytical methods produce reliable and valid data 
throughout the course of the study.  This can also include, but is not limited to, 
investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for 
method transfer a nd comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a sec ure database to ensure 
confidentiality.  
If informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_423], [COMPANY_010] can do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand the 
cardiovascular disease , the dose response and/ or prediction of response to olpasiran , 
characterize antibody response , and ch aracterize aspects of the molecule  
(eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be 
documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  
Samples can be retained for up to [ADDRESS_326114]’s medical record and are not to be 
made available to the subject, members of th e family, the personal physician, or other 
third parties, except as specified in the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
[CONTACT_21947].  Following the request from the subject, t he investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining 
blood  samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed.

PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  
Title:  SurveillanCe and Alert -based multiparameter monitoring to reducE 
worsening Heart Failure events – SCALE -HF 1 
Summary:  The overarching goal of this prospective, multicenter study is to utilize 
data from the Bodyport Cardiac Scale to develop an algorithm that allows 
for the early detection of worsening heart failure (HF) . The Bodyport 
Cardiac Scale  is capable of measuring key HF parameters of congestion 
and cardiac perfusion on a regular basis in a patient’s home. These data 
will be combined into a model or composite index that may be used to 
identify patients at increased risk for decompensation, i nform the reason 
for their decline, and offer the possibility to remotely optimize therapy to 
prevent further worsening HF.  
 
The SCALE -HF program will consist of multiple phases. For SCALE -HF 1, 
patients will be prospectively enrolled and utilize the Body port Cardiac 
Scale  on a daily basis. Patients and clinicians will be blinded to the results 
other than data readily available from other devices such as body weight. There will be no attempt to influence clinical practice. Patients will be 
followed remotel y for suspected clinical events.  
Objectives:  
 The primary objective of this study is to utilize data from the Bodyport 
Cardiac Scale to develop a model that allows for the early detection of 
worsening HF.  
Endpoints:  The primary endpoint of the study wi ll be worsening HF. Worsening HF will 
be defined as an urgent, unscheduled clinic or emergency department visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124028] a primary diagnosis of HF in which the patient exhibited new or worsening symptoms of HF on presentation, had objecti ve evidence of new or worsening HF, and received initiation or 
intensification of treatment for HF.  
Design  This study is intended to enroll a broad population of patients. Patients 
may       be consented and enrolled remotely, in clinic, or prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954]. Training on device use will be provided and daily utilization will be requested. Device sensor data will be uploaded remotely and analyzed 
on a continuous basis. Treating clinicians will be blinded to the 
investigational sensor data.  
 Follow -up will occur remotely at 6 weeks, 3 months and then every 3 
months until the end of the study. Patients may also be contact[CONTACT_170229]/or study team for suspected device malfunction or nonadherence with the Bodyport Cardiac Scale.  
 
At each intervi ew, participants will be asked to report possible clinical 
events. Sites may also be queried to report possible clinical events. All patients will consent to release of medical records regarding HF history and suspected clinical events. Based on site - and participant -reported 
events, medical billing data and medical records for possible clinical events 
will be collected. Possible clinical events will be reviewed and adjudicated 
by a clinical events committee using standardized definitions. The 
committee mem bers will be blinded to sensor and algorithm data.  
Population:  Approximately [ADDRESS_199213] be able to stand independently on the 
Bodyport Cardiac Scale.  
 
We will exclude patients with a weight > 170 kg , prior heart trans plant or 
currently listed for heart transplant, current LVAD, current inotropes, and 
end-stage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis.  
Sites Enrolling 
Participants:  Approximately 5 US sites

2. BACKGROUND  AND  TRIAL  RATIONALE   
2.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION   Heart failure (HF) is a major health, social and economic problem worldwide.
[ADDRESS_199217] decade with the introduction of medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_170218].
4 However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_170219], the number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_170220].5 As a result, reducing HF readmission rates has become a priority in many of the developed 
countries. In the US alone, the costs related to HF are expected to reach $70 billion by 2030, an increase of 130% on current costs.
6-[ADDRESS_199218] early worsening HF in order to allow for clinical 
interventions to prevent disease progression.  
2.3 POTENTIAL RISKS  
The known risks to participants in the trial will be minimal, as SCALE -HF 1 will be limited to data 
collection. Risk is involved to the extent that privacy and confidentiality m ay be compromised. However, 
every reasonable effort will be made to limit breaches of privacy and confidentiality.  
3. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
3.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES  
 
The primary objective of this study is to utilize data from the Bodyport Cardiac Scale to  develop an 
algorithm that allows for the early detection of worsening HF.  
3.1 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
 
The secondary objectives of this study are to compare data from the Bodyport Cardiac Scale to:  
● Data obtained from approved implantable devices and sensors  
● Data obtained from other markers of congestion including invasive hemodynamics, biomarkers, and blood volume analysis  
3.2 ENDPOINTS  
 
The primary endpoint of the study will be worsening HF.   Worsening HF will be defined as an urgent, unscheduled clinic (r equiring IV diuretics) or emergency 
department visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124028] a primary diagnosis of HF in which the patient exhibited new 
or worsening symptoms of HF on presentation, had objective evidence of new or worsening HF, and 
received initiation  or intensification of treatment for HF.  
 Information will also be collected on death and any mortality events will be classified as cardiovascular or non -cardiovascular. We will also collect data on arrhythmic events requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_170221] a 
defib rillator shock where the collected data allows such an assessment.  
4. STUDY  DESIGN  
4.[ADDRESS_199219] population of 
patients with HF and follow them remotely for clinical events. Patients will be identified by [CONTACT_170230], in clinic, or prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Follow -up 
visits will be remote and occur at 6 weeks, 3 months and then every 3 months until the end of the study. 
Follow -up information will be collected by [CONTACT_170231] a centralized telephone 
call center (and email) via trained personnel at the Duke Clinical Research Institute. Participants may also be contact[CONTACT_170229]/ or study team at other timepoints for study issues such as suspected 
device malfunction or nonadherence with the Bodyport Cardiac Scale.  
 Patients eligible for the study will have HF and a prior history of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_170222]. A history of clinical HF will be confirmed by [CONTACT_141444]. To ensure that a 
broad population of patients is enrolled, there will be limited additional inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
The participant population is described in more detail in Section [ADDRESS_199220] recent basic metabolic panel (sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine) and natriuretic 
peptide levels, B -type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N -terminal pro -BNP. Where available will collect right heart cath data.  
c Includes heart failure history including last assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction  
d Patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices including pulmonary artery sensors and implantable cardioverter 
defibrillators will provide routine interrogation dat a 
e Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_170223] -cause mortality.  
f Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_170224] (shock by [CONTACT_170232])  
5. STUDY POPULATION  
5.[ADDRESS_199221] fulfill all of the following criteria:  
1. Provide informed consent before trial enrollment  
2. Age ≥ 18 years  
3. A diagnosis of symptomatic HF including a worsening HF event in the preceding 12 months. Worsening HF events will be determined by [CONTACT_170233] -investigators and will typi[INVESTIGATOR_170225]: a) HF symptoms (eg, dyspnea, fatigue); b) HF signs (eg, elevated jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema), or laboratory/imaging evidence of HF (eg, pulmonary congestion on chest x -ray, elevated natriuretic peptide l evels) during the event, and treatments targeting 
acute HF (eg, intravenous diuretics, vasodilators, or inotropes).  
 
5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
 
Patients fulfilling any of the following criteria are not eligible for inclusion in this study. No additional 
exclu sions may be applied by [CONTACT_093], in order to ensure that the trial population will be 
representative of all eligible participants.  
1. Weight > 170 kg  
2. Use of chronic inotropic therapy  
3. Prior heart transplant or currently listed for heart transplant  
4. Current or planned left ventricular assistance device  
5. Chronic kidney disease requiring chronic dialysis  
6. Unknown left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The LVEF should be based on the most recent 
local measurement using echocardiography, multigated acq uisition scan, computed tomography 
scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or ventricular angiography. Patients with preserved and 
reduced LVEF will be permitted in the study though enrollment may be capped to ensure no 
more than approximately 2/[ADDRESS_199222] be able  and willing to stand independently on the Bodyport Cardiac Scale  daily . 
 
6. STUDY VISITS AND ACTIVITIES  
6.1 SCREENING AND ENROLLMENT  
 
Patients will be identified from outpatient clinic logs as well as current admission panels. Patients previously included in clinical trials will also be screened for candidacy. Eligible candidates will be 
enrolled from an outpatient setting or an inpatient setting. Enrollment will be cap ped to ensure that no 
more than approximately 2/3 of the total enrollment will be at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_170226].  
 Prior to screening activities, each patient will be given an opportunity to ask questions and to understand  the details of study participation, including risks and benefits. This consent process will be 
documented in the patients’ source documents and evidenced by [CONTACT_170234] (ICF). All patients will consent to release of medic al records regarding HF history and 
suspected clinical events.  Informed consent will be obtained either in person or via e -consent according 
to respective institutional policies.  
 
After signing the ICF, each patient will be assigned a unique identifier nu mber that will be used on all 
documentation.  
 Screening data will be collected after informed consent is signed. The Screening evaluations include:  
● Informed Consent  
● Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
● Demographics  
● Medical history  
● Most recent physical examination, biomarkers (NT- proBNP, basic metabolic panel) and vital 
signs measurements  
● Current medications  
● Recent laboratory data including renal function and natriuretic peptide values  
If measurement of any of the above assessments does not occur in the  normal course of patient care, 
clinical practice should not be changed to accommodate collection of additional data.  
 
Following enrollment, the patient will be provided with the study device and receive training in person 
or remotely  on its use from study  coordinators or company representatives.  
1. Outpatient -  Enrollment can occur in person or remotely. Scale will be provided upon clinic visit 
or shipped to patient directly after the appointment  
2. Inpatient - Patient is enrolled prior to discharge. Scale will be provided prior to discharge or 
shipped by [CONTACT_170235] . to patient directly after the discharged  
 
 
6.2 SURVEILLANCE/FOLLOW UP  
 
Follow -up will occur remotely at 6 weeks, 3 months and then every 3 months until the end of the study.  
Follow -up will occur via telephone interviews by [CONTACT_170236]. This 
approach will ensure the consistency and quality of data collection and minimize loss to follow -up. At 
each interview, participants will be asked to report any encountered clinical events.  
 
Routine data collection at each follow up timepoint will include:  
● Possible clinical event including those that occur outside of the enrolling health system such as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency room visit or clinic visit with IV diuretic administration  
 
Based on participant -reported events, clinical data for rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency department visits, 
and worsening heart failure related clinic visits will be obtained and submitted for review. As an additional mech anism to safeguard against under- reporting of events, sites will conduct medical record 
queries at 6 weeks, 3 months and then every 3 months until the end of the study  enrollment to screen 
for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34866].  
 Patients may also be contact[CONTACT_170237]/or study team including the sponsor and coordinating 
center for suspected device malfunction or nonadherence with the Bodyport Cardiac Scale. Nonadherence is defined as device non -use for 3 days or more. Patients will be potentially contac ted 
using email, phone calls or text messaging to provide reminders to use the scale. Should non -use 
continue beyond 4 days the patient may be contact[CONTACT_426] a phone call to explore potential problems with the technology or explore whether an event might hav e occurred.  
 
Upon study discontinuation the patients are asked to return the scale to the company and are provided 
with a return shippi[INVESTIGATOR_7801].  
7. COMPENSATION  
Participants will not receive any compensation for participating in this study.  
 
8. COSTS  
Participants will not incur any additional costs due to study participation. Patients or their insurance company will be required to pay for all expenses related to regular care such as outpatient visits and other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422].  
 
9. SAFETY MONITORING  
No s afety related concerns are expected with the non -invasive scale. No safety specific / adverse 
endpoints are defined  
 
10. STATISTICAL  METHODS  AND  DATA  ANALYSIS 
10.1 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS  
 
The Bodyport Cardiac Scale captures various physiological signals including an electrocardiograph, an 
impedance plethysmograph, and a ballistocardiograph. These raw signals will be filtered and 
interpolated prior to feature extraction and model validation. Regions with motion artifacts or noise will be identified  and removed. Ensemble average waveforms will be constructed from the real -time signals. 
Specific characteristic features will be identified on the averaged waveforms. Temporal and amplitude -
based biomarkers will be extracted from the identified features w ithin and across each averaged 
waveform. These features and biomarkers will be assessed longitudinally by [CONTACT_170238]. Some of 
the key features being ex plored in this study are: weight, heart rate, heart rate variability, peripheral  
impedance, body fluid, balance, stroke volume, cardiac output, pre -ejection period, left ventricular 
ejection time, as well as the amplitude and timing of characteristic feat ures on the IPG, ECG, and BCG 
signals. A focus on these specific features is driven by [CONTACT_170239].  
 
During analysis, various methods will be implemented to select signal features that demonstrate a 
meaningful association with HFEs. Those features most strongly correlated to HFEs will be combined into a model and associated alert algorithm. The development of the model may use a combination of 
techniques, including m ultivariate regression and machine learning (e.g. support vector machines, 
clustering, decision trees, Bayesian networks). Models will be evaluated and optimized based on their 
sensitivity and specificity to detect heart failure events.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_199223] meaningful deviations from a patient’s b aseline state.  
10.[ADDRESS_199224] approximately 75 primary endpoints  which will approximate to 
about 300 enrolled patients . An event rate of 75 equates to an approximate rate of 25% at [ADDRESS_199225] (IRB).  
 
Any change or addition to this protocol requires a w ritten protocol amendment that must be approved 
by [CONTACT_170235]. and the Investigator before implementation. Amendments affecting the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study require additional approval by [CONTACT_1201]. Examples of ame ndments requiring such approval are:  
1. A significant change in the study design (e.g., duration of follow up)  
2. A change in patient inclusion and exclusion criteria  
 Protocol changes affecting only administrative aspects of the study do not require form al protocol 
amendments or IRB approval, but the IRB must be kept informed of such administrative changes.  
  11.[ADDRESS_199226]’s clinical source documents (usually defined by [CONTACT_170240]/safety parameters 
independent of the CRFs) would include but are not limited to the subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physicians’ and nurses’ notes, appointment book, original laboratory reports, ECG, pathology and special 
assessme nt reports and signed ICFs. All information on the CRFs must be traceable to these source 
documents in the subject's file. Data without a written or electronic record will be defined before study 
start and will be recorded directly on the CRFs, which will be documented as being the source data.  
 
Essential documents defined in the ICH Guidance on Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6) and listed below, must be retained by [CONTACT_170241].  The Sponsor will notify the Investigator(s)/institution(s) when the study -related records are 
no longer required. The Investigator agrees to adhere to the document retention procedures by [CONTACT_12142].  
 
Essential documents include:  
1. IRB approva ls for the study protocol and all amendments  
2. All source documents and laboratory records  
3. CRF copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
4. Subjects' ICFs (with study number and title of study)  
 
 
11.3 AUDITING PROCEDURES  
Investigator understands that source documents for this study mus t be made available to appropriately 
qualified personnel from the Sponsor or its designees, to the IRB, and/or to health authority inspectors after appropriate notification. The verification of the CRF data must be by [CONTACT_85349].  The Sponsor conducts audits of clinical research activities in accordance with internal SOPs 
to evaluate compliance with the principles of GCP. A regulatory authority may also wish to conduct an 
inspection (during the study or even after its completion). If an inspection is requested by a regulatory 
authority, the Investigator must immediately inform the Sponsor that this request has been made.  
  11.4 PUBLICATION OF RESULTS  
An integrated clinical and statistical report will be prepared at the completion of  the treatment period. 
However, it is intended that the results of the study will be included on http://clinicaltrials.gov  and 
published and/or presented at scientific meetings.  
  
11.[ADDRESS_199227] similar confidentiality from his/her staff and the IRB. The information provided by [CONTACT_170235]. to the In vestigator may not be disclosed to others without direct written 
authorization from Bodyport Inc., except to the extent necessary to obtain informed consent from subjects who wish to participate in the study.  
The Investigator must assure that subjects’ ano nymity will be maintained and that their identities are 
protected from unauthorized parties. The Investigator should keep a subject enrollment log relating 
codes to the names of subjects. The Investigator should maintain documents not for submission to the  
Sponsor, (e.g., subjects’ signed consent forms), in strict confidence.  
 
Data use agreements or contracts will be executed with each participating site in addition to the applicable institutional approvals prior to any participating site investigator sendi ng patient/subject data 
for this study.

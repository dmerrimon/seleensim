 PROTOCOL TITLE:  
Use of novel Sinusonic device for prevention of community acquired  
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (URI)  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the clinical study protocol, international 
good clinical practice principles (International Conference on Harmonization [ICH] -
Good Clinical Practice [GCP]), and regulatory authority requirements.

 1.0   Objectives / Specific Aims :  
Sinusonic  is a simple handheld device that uses acoustic vibrations (128Hz) and positive 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_826598]. Beneficial effects have been 
shown in a clinical trial studying chronic rhinitis that showed improvements in nasal 
blockage/congestion, nasal drainage, nasal/sinus pressure and sense of smell ( Soler ZM 
etal available at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alr.[ZIP_CODE] ). A small 
unpublished pi[INVESTIGATOR_164180] >70% increases in peak nasal  nitric oxide ( NO) 
after one use of Sinusonic.  NO is known to stimulate mucociliary clearance and has 
antiviral properties. Given that Sinusonic improves nasal congestion, nasal drainage and appears to increase NO which has antiviral properties, our hypothesis is that use of Sinusonic will decrease the frequency, severity and duration of community acquired viral URIs .  
Aim 1: To determine if Sinusonic decreases the number  of URIs 
experienced during an 8 week fall URI season. Subjects will use an active 
device (positive expi[INVESTIGATOR_826599] 128 Hz) or a sham device (no 
positive expi[INVESTIGATOR_826599] 1,000 Hz ) for 1 min three times a day  for 8 
weeks. Daily URI symptoms  will be recorded electronically.  
Aim 2: To determine if Sinusonic  decreases the severity and duration of 
community acquired viral URIs. Subjects will use active or sham device as above. Severity and duration of URIs will be recorded using daily symptom diaries.

 2.0 Background  
 
Sinusonic is a simple 
handheld device t hat uses 
acoustic vibrations 
(128Hz) and positive 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_826600]. Beneficial  
effects have been  shown 
in a clinical trial that 
showed improvements in nasal blockage/congestion, nasal drainage, nasal/ sinus pressure and 
sense of smell (
Soler 
ZM, etal ). Some of these benefits occurred after one use of the device and these benefits 
continued to increase throughout the 5 week study.  In this clinical trial, approximately 80% of 
patients demons trated improvement . A small unpublished pi[INVESTIGATOR_164180] >70% 
increases in peak nasal NO after one use of Sinusonic.  Our hypothesis is that use of Sinusonic improves nasal congestion, mucociliary clearance and exhaled NO, all of  which decrease vir al 
infections.  3.0 Intervention to be studied 
 Subjects will be screened for likely inclusion during the summer months. Baseline 
demographics, medical comorbidities, and URI  symptoms will be assessed . Informed consent 
will be completed.  
 The fall URI season typi[INVESTIGATOR_826601]  (Turner R etal). Towards the 
end of screening , all s ubjects will be randomized 2:1 to active use of Sinusonic (128Hz) for 1 
minute 3 times daily or an identical “placebo” device that emits a frequency of 1,[ADDRESS_1146591] a “cold” . Previously validated questions for viral 
URI studies are rating 8 items on a l ikert scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe 
symptoms) (Jackson GG, etal ). The 8 symptoms are : sneezing, runny nose, nasal 
obstruction, sore throat, cough, headache , malaise,  and chilliness . A Total Symptom 
Score (TSS) will be the sum of each symptom to provide a daily score ranging from [ADDRESS_1146592] defined the common cold as present when:  
1) TSS >  [ADDRESS_1146593] a cold OR  0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%

 2) TSS < [ADDRESS_1146594] URI, duration and symptom severity of viral URIs. These metrics will allow us to determine if Sinusonic decreases the frequency of  URIs, as well as potentially shortening the duration or decreasing the 
severity of URIs.  
3.1 Device Instructions  
 
Instructions for use:  
1. Hold the SinuSonic  device at a 45 -degree angle  
2. Deep breathe in through mouth  
3. Hold the SinuSonic  to your nose and blow  out into the 
mask of the SinuSonic . The goal here is to hear the 
“target flutter” sound that is desired during treatment 
with the SinuSonic  
4. You will feel a little resistance to breathe out and a 
vibration sensation from a speaker in the device  
5. Remove the device to “blow the nose” if nasal drainage occurs  
6. Return the device to the nose then breathe in and out thru the nose to try and hear the “target flutter” sound  
7. Time of use is [ADDRESS_1146595] 5 minutes. 
3.2 Device Usage and Safety  
 
The SinuSonic consists of a fully -disposable medical grade silicone nosepi[INVESTIGATOR_373869] a resin 
body. The device is equipped with a flutter valve located at the top of the device which creates gentle, self -guided oscillating expi[INVESTIGATOR_32721].  
 The SinuSonic is a  legally marketed device used in accordance with its labeling .  It is 
substantially equivalent to many Class I OTC devices with the same intended use and indications for use in clearing mucus to improve air flow, such as the Navage Nose Cleaner.  
  4.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria/Study Population  
Inclusion Criteria  
• Adults  18 years  or older  with no transient  sym ptoms  of any URI or allergies  at baseline.  
Exclusion Criteria  

  Version 1.0; Version 7/20/[ADDRESS_1146596]  be <9 for inclus ion 
(Eccles  etal). 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_826602] [ADDRESS_1146597] be asymptomatic at the beginning of 
study. As this study is not conducted exclusively on MUSC patients and is being done virtually (to minimize exposure and increase safety during the covid pandemic), we do not have the ability to perform widespread covid testing on hundreds of asymptomatic patients. So it is possible that someo ne will have undiagnosed covid.  
 
5.0 Number of Subjects  
 Prior research reports (Turner etal ) using identical outcome measures and studying community 
acquired URIs in the fall season report that approximately 60% of subjects suffered from a viral URI (range 48% to 75% in each arm). We are planning to include 300 subjects (200 active device, 100 s ham device). If we conservatively assume that only 50% of sham device subjects 
get an URI, we will be powered to detect a decrease to 33%.   6.[ADDRESS_1146598] (SC, NC, GA, VA)  
that have simila r fall viral URI seasons .  Potential participant screening for all subjects 
across all aims, as well as informed consent and baseline evaluations, will occur remotely to avoid any risk to research personnel .  All baseline and  follow -up measures will be 
collected remotely using REDCap  at 4 and 8 weeks .   
7.0 Recruitment Methods  
  Version 1.0; Version 7/20/[ADDRESS_1146599].  The study team member will explain: 
1. What would be different if the patient participated in the  study versus receiving 
standard of care treatment.  
2. The study  is voluntary participation, patient may withdraw any time, and PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_826603].  
3. The reason for doing the study  
4. How many people will be in the study  
5. Who is eligible to participate in the study  
6. Details regarding the stu dy device.  
7. What medical assessments/questionnaires  they will have  and how often  
8. Risks involved in participating in a study  
 9. What information will be gathered  
The prospective participant will be given adequate time to review the informed consent form and ask any questions that they have before the consent is obtained.  Participants will electronically be sent  a signed  copy of the ICF.

10.0 Data Management  
All analyses and graphs will be performed with SPSS 24.0, Sample Power 3.0, and Sigma Plot 10.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL.).  Disease information and demographic variables, such as age, gender, race, and VAS scores will be summarized using frequencies, means, and standard deviation as appropriate.  Our primary outcome metric is number of viral URIs as defined above . Secondary outcome metrics include average duration  of URIs and 
severity of symptoms (as measured by [CONTACT_13410] S) of URIs . Categorical variables will be 
compared using Chi Square or McNemar’s test.  Continuous variables will be compared using One -Way ANOVA with repeated measures follow by [CONTACT_447] -hoc analysis.  Data 
regarding safety and patient satisfaction will be su mmarized for each time point.  A p -
value ≤0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no p -value correction (ie Bonferroni) will be applied.   
11.[ADDRESS_1146600] gives informed conse nt until the 
completion of the End- of-Study visit or Early Termination Visit.  Serious adverse events 
(SAE) will be reported  to the MUSC IRB and to the sponsor  from the time of informed 
consent through [ADDRESS_1146601] use of the SinuSonic.  Adverse event data listings will be reviewed by  [INVESTIGATOR_678] [INVESTIGATOR_826604].   
Safety data listings will be reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_678], Co -Investigators, and the research 
team at regular intervals throughout the study.   
Safety will be monitored throughout the study based on monitoring of adverse events, and 
through collection of symptoms electronically.  Collection of symptoms will occur via the Daily 
URI Symptoms Score questionnaires that are electronically sent to the consented patients.  
  Version 1.0; Version 7/20/[ADDRESS_1146602] gives informed consent until completion of the End- of-study visit or Early Termination 
Visit. Serious adverse events (SAE) will be reported to the IRB and to the sponsor from the time 
of informed consent through [ADDRESS_1146603] timepoint per protocol, and that additional investigations may be 
requested by [CONTACT_826610], LLC.  
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator will immediately (within 24 hours) report 
the event to Healthy Humming, LLC and to the IRB, as applicable.  
12. Withdrawal  
At any point during the study, a subject may withdraw from the study.  The subject may 
refuse t o take part in or stop taking part in this study at any time. The subject will be 
instructed to call the investigator in charge of this study if they  decide to do this. Their  
decision not to take part in the study will not affect their  current or future me dical care or 
any benefits to which they  are entitled.  If they  wish to withdraw, they will be provided 
contact [CONTACT_826611].  
Early termination from the study is also subject to the PI’s discretion.  Subject will no longer be in the study and data will no longer be collected.  The reasons for this withdrawal could be due to study non- compliance or if the subject  no longer meet s 
eligibility requirements.  A member of the study team will notify the study participant  if 
they will no longer be participating in the study.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 of 77  Study Procedures  After informed consent, all subjects will complete screening 
procedures and tests to establish eligibility, which will be 
performed between Day -28 and Day -2. Subjects who meet 
eligibility criteria based on screening assessments may be enrolled in the study. 
Study Procedures  
(continued) Screening procedures include medical history evaluation, body 
weight and height measurements, physical exam, vital signs 
(including blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520], temperature), 
ECGs, Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) , safety 
laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), blood 
draw for evaluation of genetic variants including but not limit ed 
to APOE 4, and neurodegeneration biomarkers, creatinine 
clearance calculation, drug and alcohol breath tests, SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_462793] be completed for women of 
childbearing potential. Postmenopausal women will need to 
complete a follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) test.  
Subjects with a positive drug screen (including alcohol ) at 
Screening will be rechecked and if positive will be excluded from participation in the study.  
During the Screening Visit, the following disease and cognitive 
assessments and measures will be completed as required to 
evaluate eligibility: RBD1Q  (administered to all subjects but 
used for eligibility only in PD subjects), and MoCA. In addition, 
the modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale (MHYS) will be evaluated in 
subjects with PD for purposes of patient phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. ADCS -
CGIC will also be completed.   
Once all screening visit procedures are completed and the subject meets all eligibility criteria, the subject will return to the site to 
be trained on and practice the CANTAB. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment regimens on Day -1.  
A comprehensive list of all study procedures is provided in the 
Schedule of Events . 
Concomitant 
Medications  Any concomitant therapy used from the time the subject signs t he 
informed consent through the final visit must be recorded on the case report form (CRF) for all randomized subjects. In addition, 
any medication required for treatment of adverse events (AEs) or 
serious adverse events (SAEs) must be recorded on the CRF. 
Permitted and prohibited medications are listed in Section  5.4. 
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -[ADDRESS_462794].  
Statistical Analysis  Details of statistical parameters and methods to be used will be 
described in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Analysis of effects on baseline- deficit cognitive tasks will be 
based on an analysis of variance of the change from baseline, where baseline is the average of the two latest pre -treatment 
assessments in each treatment period with each patient used as their own control. This analysis will be described in more detail in the SAP. 
Continuous data will display number of subjects, means, standard 
deviations, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical data will display frequency counts and percentages. Unless specified 
otherwise, confidence interval s will be displayed at the two -sided 
95% confidence level.  
Disposition and baseline data will be summarized by [CONTACT_369927] (MCI and mild dementia combined and separately), 
treatment sequence and overall.  Summaries of safety, 
pharmacodynamics  and PK w ill be presented by [CONTACT_369928], 
treatment ( active versus placebo) , drug (CST-2032/ CST -107) 
and overall. A limited subset of summaries may be presented by [CONTACT_369929]/or period and overall.  
For primary and secondary endpoints, observed values and changes from baseline, as well as the difference between change from baseline within subject, will be summarized. For continuous 
endpoints, the difference is defined as change from baseline on 
drug minus change from baseline on placebo. Comparisons may be made using a mixed model with factors for disease criteria, 
treatment, treatment sequence, subject nested in sequence (as a 
random effect), period, and baseline values as appropriate. Comparisons between treatments may also be compared using the paired t -test and/or nonparametric tests where appropriate.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 77  1. INTRODUCTION 
The noradrenergic system, and β -Ars in particular, are promising therapeutic targets for 
cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  and Parkinson’s disease (PD) . In 
multiple transgenic mouse models of AD, xamoterol, a β -AR agonist, enhances cognitive 
function associated with the disease ( Ardestani 2017, Coutellier 2014, Faizi  2011, 
Faizi  2012, Salehi 2009). Xamoterol additionally attenuates three major pathological 
hallmarks of AD: beta -amyloid burden, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation (Ardestani 
2017). Collectively, these data suggest that targeting β -AR may have the unique potential to 
provide compreh ensive therapeutic benefits for the treatment of AD.  
Several epi[INVESTIGATOR_369890] β -AR agonists may be 
more protective against development of PD ( Aaseth 2018, Clark 2018, Gronich2018, 
Magistrelli 20 20, Mittal 2017 , Searles 2018 ). Additional data also suggest that the effect of 
β-AR agonists may generalize to other cognitive disorders such as mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and AD ( Chalermpalanupap 2013, Coutellier 2014).  
The locus coeruleus ( LC) is a small nucleus located in the pons and is the primary  source of 
noradrenaline (norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) in the forebrain ( Brunnström 2011). LC axons project to 
multiple cortical and subcortical regions that underlie memory, attention, and emotional 
processing, including the hippocampus, frontoparietal cortex, and amygdala ( Berridge 2003). 
Through its binding to both α and β -adrenoceptors, noradrenaline plays a key role in a variety 
of essential central nervous system (CNS) functions such as learning and memory, arousal, attention, and cognition, and plays an important role in maintaining brain homeostasis by [CONTACT_369932].  
Neuroanatomical studies have identified the LC as one of the earliest sites in the brain affected in cognitive diseases including AD and PD ( Braak 2011, Braak 2017). Consistent 
with this, profound degeneration of noradrenergic neurons is an  established early finding of 
AD, and deficits in noradrenergic neurotransmission have been described both in human patients and mouse AD models ( Adolfsson 1979, Bondareff 1987, Grudzien 2007, 
Hoogendijk 1999, Iversen  1983, Kalaria 1989 , Tejani -Butt 1993). Importantly, the 
dysfunction of the noradrenergic system is tightly linked to both cognitive symptoms of AD and underlying disease progression at many levels such as neuroinflammation (Bondareff 1987, Heneka 2002, Jardanhazi -Kurutz 2010).  
Progressive and extensive degeneration of the L C is evident early in patients with AD or PD  
(Kalaria 1989 , Vermeiren 2017), giving rise to a hypothesis that the LC is a “gr ound zero” 
for the pathology underlying the development of cognitive impairment, and nonmotor symptoms and can further complicate the lives of PD patients ( Nahimi 2018).  
The role of β
2-AR extends beyond neurotransmission ( Figure 1 ). Expression of β 2-Ars is 
observed across multiple cell types including neurons, nerve fibers, microglia, astrocytes, 
oligodendrocytes and blood vessels ( Gao 2016 ). This diversity in cellular localization gives 
rise to a corresponding diversity of function. For example, β 2-Ars have been shown to 
promote glycogenolysis and lactate release from astrocytes which contribute to memory consolidation and long-term potentiation of synaptic strength in hippocampal neurons 
(Sorg  1991, Gao 2016, Suzuki 2011). Hypometabolism is an early feature of 
neurode 
generation in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases ( Cunnane 2020, Sonninen 2020), 
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -015  July 11, 2023 
Amendment 10 CuraSen Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 77  and it is thought that glial metabolic support of neurons is  neuroprotective in the context of 
disease ( Cai 2019, Cunnane 2020).  A pro -metabolic role of β -AR stimulation has been 
variously demonstrated: a drenergic stimulation alters the cellular metabolism of astrocyte s 
(Dienel 2016), i ncreased cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the second 
messenger produced by β -AR signaling, is associated with enhanced glycolysis 
(Vardjan  2018 ), and s timulation of β -Ars increases cellular glucose uptake ( Catus 2011) and 
glycogenolysis ( Hertz 2010 ). 
Finally, it is hypothesized that normal noradrenergic signaling from the LC may protect 
against inflammation, and that neuroinflammation in degenerative diseases may result from 
the progressive damage to the LC. This is supported by [CONTACT_369933]-mediated lesioning of the LC induces neuroinflammation ( Pugh 2007), while 
stimulation of β
2-AR expressed on microglia and astrocytes appears to be anti- inflammatory 
effect (reviewed by O’Donnell 2012).

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 77  In humans, increases in cerebral perfusion, measured as cerebral blood flow (CBF) by 
[CONTACT_369934] g (ASL MRI) in brain regions relevant to 
cognition, attention and arousal, the thalamus, hippocampus and amygdala, were observed following administration of a β
2-AR agonist, clenbuterol, in a clinical study sponsored by 
[CONTACT_369935], Inc ( CST103/CST107/CST-109- CLIN -002). Similarly, improvements 
in performance in CANTAB domains were observed following administration of CST-2032 in healthy volunteers and subjects with MCI in the phase 1 study, CST2032- CLIN -007 
(Figure 2 ). Increases in cerebral perfusion are expected under conditions of increased 
neuronal activity. This phenomenon of neurovascular coupling arises from integrated responses from multiple cell types,  many of which are known to express β
2 receptors, 
including neurons, cerebral blood  vessels, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes  
(Giorgi 2020).  
Taken together, LC neuronal loss and the resulting widespread consequence of noradrenergic deficiency  in neuronal transmission, metabolism and inflammation are believed to underpin 
cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that this noradrenergic deficiency may be restored through exogenous adrenergic stimulation using t he β
2-AR 
agonist, CST-2032.

subtype, and minimal CNS penetration, was developed. Examination of the large number of 
widely used β -AR antagonists revealed one established antagonist, nadolol (CST-107), as 
uniquely fitting this need, assuming that an optimal dose level could be identified t hat 
preferentially blocked only β2 AR function in the peripheral tissues, with low access to desired CNS targets. CuraSen’s data from the CLIN -[ADDRESS_462826] -2032. These dos es are less than 10% 
of the lowest dose for nadolol approved for treatment of angina or hypertension (40 mg) and are likely to preferentially i nhibit β2- ARs. The CLIN -007 study additionally confirmed that 
only 2 to 3 % of the plasma concentration of nadolol is detected in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872], 
supporting the use of this combination dosing therapeutic strategy, that will eventually require formulation of a fixed dose combination drug product. 
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -[ADDRESS_462827] disease. As such, peripherally mediated the 
pharmacologic effects and risks associated with this class of agent a re well known, including 
increased heart rate, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, muscle twitch and tremor, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
and peripheral vasodilatation (see Ventolin [albuterol] HFA label ).  
It is u nderstood that these peripherally mediated effects may  not be ideal properties for a 
medication for use in long- term patient studies. Accordingly, the use of doses of CST-[ADDRESS_462828]-2032 were determined to be 110 and 
15 mg/kg/day, respectively, the highest doses tested in the GLP 28- day repeated -dose 
toxicity studies.  Based on the CLIN -[ADDRESS_462829]-2032 are 588- and 193-fold below the AUC
0-24 at the no -observed adverse event 
levels in 28-day toxicity studies in rat and dog ( Investigator Brochure [IB] ). 
The [ADDRESS_462830]-2032 (0.3 – 12 mg) was evaluated in healthy volunteers as 
monotherapy (0.3–- 6 mg, as an oral solution) or with co-administered or pre- administered 
CST-107 (nadolol, 1 – 40 mg, as oral capsules, or tablets). In addition, the effects on safety, 
PK and effects on cognition using the using measures from the CANTAB and cerebral perfusion (by [CONTACT_179127]) were evaluated in patients with MCI or PD following a single dose 
of [ADDRESS_462831]-107 (nadolol). 
The most common AEs with CST-2032 monotherapy (other than skin reactions to ECG 
electrodes) were increases in heart rate, tremor, pa lpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], headache, dizziness and 
hypokalemia as well as the observed increases in QTc and glucose and decreases in potassium and are consistent with the β
2-AR agonist drug class. Heart rate generally 
increased with dose when 1 – [ADDRESS_462832]-2032 was administered as monotherapy, with concomitant decreases in  plasma potassium concentration. These responses, which are 
consistent with known effects of β
2 AR agonists, were generally transient with maximal 
effects at approximately 2 to 3 hours after dosing, at the approximate plasma T max of 
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -[ADDRESS_462833] marked. The time-course of the QTc effects, generally followed the same profile as the changes in 
potassium and heart rate: with largest changes within the first [ADDRESS_462834]-2032 and returned to pre-dose levels within 1 day of dosing.  
Breakthrough increases in QTcF were also observed when sub-optimal doses of nadolol (1 mg) were used in combination with CST-2032. Effects of CST-[ADDRESS_462835], nadolol, and essentially eliminated by 
[CONTACT_094]-administration of > 1 mg nadolol. No instances of QTcF > 450 ms or ΔQTcF > 30 ms 
were observed in subjects who received ≥[ADDRESS_462836] -2032. The observed 
potassium concentrations range from 3.8 to 4.3 mml/L in subjects who received 1, 3, or [ADDRESS_462837]-2032 to humans and the potency at the hERG potassium channel. Similarly, a greater 
than 300-fold margin between was observed between the C max and other cardiac ion channels 
(Nav1.5, Nav1.5 (late), KCNQ1/mink, Kv4.3/kChIP2, Kir2.1, Cav1.2).  
While the data strongly suggest that the apparent QTcF prolongation seen with monotherapy 
is due to decreases in potassium or failure to adequately correct for increases in heart rate, in an overabundance of caution this study will exclude subjects who have a QTcF > [ADDRESS_462838]-2032 was associated with  improvements in cognition ( by [CONTACT_185383],  Figure 2) and

4.4. Diagnostic criteria  
The following diagnostic criteria are provided for identification of eligible subjects under 
inclusion criterion 2.  
• The National Institute on Aging -Alzheimer ’s Association defines the core clinical 
criteria  for diagnosis of MCI ( Albert 2011) as follows:  
‒ Cognitive concern reflecting a change in cognition reported by [CONTACT_369940] (i.e., historical or observed evidence of decline over time) . 
‒ Objective evidence of impairment in one or more cognitive domains, typi[INVESTIGATOR_369894] (i.e., formal or bedside testing to establish level of cognitive function in multiple domains). 
‒ Preservation of independence in functional abilities. 
‒ Not demented . 
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -015  July 11, 2023 
Amendment 10 CuraSen Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 77  • The [LOCATION_008] Parkinson’s Disease Brain Bank criteria for PD ( Clark 2016) 
are: 
‒ Bradykinesia (slowness of initiation of voluntary movement with progressive 
reduction in speed and amplitude of repetitive actions). 
‒ And at least one of the following: 
1. muscular rigidity  
2. 4–[ADDRESS_462862] tremor  
3. postural instability not caused by [CONTACT_369941], vestibular, cerebellar, or proprioceptive dysfunction. 
• RBD diagnosis will be evaluated in subjects with PD and recorded using the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition ( ICSD -3) criteria for 
RBD (albeit documentation by [CONTACT_369942])  as well as the RBD1Q. The ICSD -3 criteria for RBD are:  
‒ repeated times of arousal during sleep where the subject talks, makes noises or 
performs complex motor behaviors, such as punching, kicking, or running 
movements that often relate to the content of the subject’s dreams 
‒ the subject recalls dreams associated with these movements or sounds 
‒ if the subject awakens during the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], they are alert and not confused or disoriented 
‒ the subject’s sleep disturbance is not caused by [CONTACT_369943], a mental health disorder, medication, or substance abuse 
• The National Institute on Aging -Alzheimer ’s Asso ciation defines the core clinical 
criteria for the diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s disease ( McKhann 2011) as:  
‒ Meets criteria for dementia, with cognitive or behavioral symptoms that: 
1. Inter fere with the ability to function at work or at usual activities; and  
2. Represent a decline from previous levels of functioning and performing; and 
3. Are not explained by [CONTACT_369944]; 
4. Cognitive impairment is detected and diagnosed through a combination of (1) history-taking from the patient and a knowledgeable informant and (2) an objective cognitive assessment, 
either a “bedside” mental status examination or neuropsychological 
testing. Neuropsychological testing should be performed when the routine history and bedside mental status examination cannot provide a confident diagnosis. 
5. The cognitive or behavioral impairment involves a minimum of two of the following domains: 
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -015  July 11, 2023 
Amendment 10 CuraSen Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 77  a. Impaired ability to acquire and remember new information —
symptoms include repetitive questions or conversations, 
misplacing personal belongings, forgetting events or 
appointments, getting lost on a familiar route. 
b. Impaired reasoning and handling of complex tasks, poor 
judgment— symptoms include poor understanding of saf ety 
risks, inability to manage finances, poor decision-making 
ability, inability to plan complex or sequential activities.  
c. Impaired visuospatial abilities —symptoms include inability to 
recognize faces or common objects or to find objects in direct view des pi[INVESTIGATOR_369895], inability to operate simple 
implements, or orient clothing to the body. 
d. Impaired language functions (speaking, reading, writing)—symptoms include difficulty thinking of common words while speaking, hesitations; speech, spelling, and writi ng errors.  
e. Changes in personality, behavior, or comportment—symptoms include uncharacteristic mood fluctuations such as agitation, 
impaired motivation, initiative, apathy, loss of drive, social 
withdrawal, decreased interest in previous activities, loss of empathy, compulsive or obsessive behaviors, socially unacceptable behaviors.  
‒ In addition to the criteria for dementia above, probable Alzheimer’s disease has the following characteristics:  
1. Insidious onset. Symptoms have a gradual onset over months to years, not sudden over hours or days; 
2. Clear -cut history of worsening of cognition by [CONTACT_124526]; 
and  
3. The initial and most prominent cognitive deficits are evident on history and examination in one of the following categories. 
a. Amnestic presentat ion: It is the most common syndromic 
presentation of AD dementia. The deficits should include impairment in learning and recall of recently learned 
information. There should also be evidence of cognitive 
dysfunction in at least one other cognitive domain, as defined earlier in the text.  
b. Nonamnestic presentations: 
• Language presentation: The most prominent deficits are in word-finding, but deficits in other cognitive domains should be present. 
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -015  July 11, 2023 
Amendment 10 CuraSen Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 77  • Visuospatial presentation: The most prominent deficits 
are in spatial cognition, including object agnosia, impaired face recognition, simultanagnosia, and alexia. Deficits in other cognitive domains should be present. 
• Executive dysfunction: The most prominent deficits are 
impaired reasoning, judgment, and problem solving. 
Deficits in other cognitive domains should be present. 
 
4.5. Enrollment Procedures  and Randomization

5.3.5. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS, is a suicidal ideation and behavior rating scale to evaluate suicide risk 
(Posner 2011). It rates an individual’s degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from 
“wish to be dead” to “active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent and behaviors.” 
The scale identifies specific behaviors which may be indicative of an individual’ s intent to 
complete suicide. The tool is administered by a qualified rater via interview with the subject. 
5.3.6. Clinical/Disease and Cognitive Scales and Assessments  
Clinical/disease and cognitive scales and assessments must be administered by [CONTACT_369950]. Clinical and cognitive scales will be conducted for all subjects 
unless otherwise stated and will be performed as outlined on the Schedule of Events . The 
descriptions of these clinical/disease and cognitive scales are noted below.  
 Digital Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)  
The DSST integrates complex neuropsychological processes and measures aspects of cognitive function, including cognitive and psychomotor speed, attention, visual scanning, and executive function. The specific version of the DSST used in this study is the Coding subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – 4
th edition (WAIS- IV). 
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -015  July 11, 2023

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 77  Subjects are asked to copy simple graphic symbols that are paired to the digits 1–9 within a 
specified time period. Using a key, the examinee is asked to draw each symbol under its 
corresponding number. The examinee’s score is determined by [CONTACT_369951] a 90 or 120- second time limit. Higher scores indicate better 
performance; for a [ADDRESS_462890] published normative data by [CONTACT_551], and education level (2008 NCS Pearson, Inc. ) as a means of evaluating test performance.   
 Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)  
The MoCA ( Nasreddine 2005) is a brief cognitive screening tool that is used in clinical 
research and practice. The scores range from 0 to 30 with scores lower than 26 suggesting cognitive disorder. The MoCA includes measures of expressive and receptive language, memory, and praxis. There are items that screen executive functions and working memory.  
 Geriatric Depression Scale-30 (GDS -30) 
The GDS is a 30 -item self -administered yes/no question test constructed for brief screening 
of depression in elderly persons ( Yesavage 1983 ). Scores greater than [ADDRESS_462891] for depression. 
 Alzheimer’ s Disease Cooperative Study -Clinical Global Impression of 
Change (ADCS -CGIC)  
The ADCS -CGIC focuses on clinicians’ observations of change in the patient’s cognitive, 
functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of a trial ( Schneider 1997) . It 
relies on both direct examination of the patient and interview of informants. Unlike a targeted 
symptom scale, it takes into account a subject’s overall function in the cognitive, behavioral, and functional activity domains. Scoring is based on an interview with the caregiver and examination of the patient by [CONTACT_213999].  The MoCA will be used to provide the cognitive assessment . The ADCS -CGIC requires the assessor to consider a number of 
cognitive, functional, and behavioral areas prior to providing an overall “global” assessment of clinical change. It is performed by [CONTACT_369952], using a worksheet that comprehensively lists relevant symptoms potentially useful in judging clinically meaningful change, and allows for notes for future reference .  
 Starkstein Apathy Scale short form  (SAS -6) 
The SAS -6 is a  6-item questionnaire to measure the severity of apath etic symptoms 
(Garofalo 2021, Starkstein 1992). In the SAS-6, each question is read by [CONTACT_4921], and 
the patient is provided with four possible answers: “not at all,” “slightly,” “some,” or “a lot” 
which are scored on a 4- point Likert scale  (range: 0 –3). Scores range from 0 to 18; higher 
scores indicate more severe apathy.  
 Connors Adult ADHD Rating Scale – self -report short form (CAARS)  
The CAARS is an 26- item scale designed to assess, diagnose, and monitor treatment of 
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) in adults . The self -report short form contains 
factor -derived scales for i nattention/m emory , hyperactivity/r estlessness,

Erhardt, and Sparrow, unpublished).  
 REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Single- Question Screen  (RBD1Q)   
The RBD1Q is a single “yes-no” question that queries the classic dream- enactment behavior 
of RBD ( Postuma 2012) and will be administered at Screening to identify subjects with REM 
sleep behavior disorder. 
The RBD1Q consists of a single question, answered “yes” or “no,” as follows: “Have you 
ever been told, or suspected yourself, that you seem to ‘act out your dreams’ while asleep (for example, punching, flailing your arms in the air, making running movements, etc.)?” 
RBD1Q will be evaluated and recorded for all subjects , but to be used to as sess eligibility for 
subjects with PD only.  
 Modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale  (MHYS)  for subjects with PD only  
The MHYS is a clinician -completed rating scale that is used to describe the symptom 
progression of PD. Originally described in 1967, it parsed the progression of PD into 5 
stages. It has since been modified with the addition of stages 1.5 and 2.5 to account for the intermediate course of PD ( Fahn 1987). As such, the MHYS is as follows: 
• Stage 0: No signs of disease. 
• Stage 1.0: Unilateral disease . 
• Stage 1.5: Unilateral plus axial involvement. 
• Stage 2: Bilateral disease, without impairment of balance . 
• Stage 2.5: Mild bilateral disease, with recovery on pull test. 
• Stage 3: Mild to moderate bilateral disease; some postural instability; physically 
independent. 
• Stage 4: Severe disability; still able to walk or stand unassisted . 
• Stage 5: Wheelchair bound or bedridden unless aided. 
 
The MHYS will be evaluated during screening (unless completed wi thin the past 3 months) 
for purposes of phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_369899]. It will not be used as an enrollment 
criterion.  
 CANTAB Assessments  
The CANTAB is a standardized and automated administration of cognitive testing via touch tablet, which will includ e the following: 
• The Reaction Time (RTI) task is a processing and psychomotor speed task. It begins 
with a simple stage with only one target and can be increased to [ADDRESS_462892] as possible. 
• The Verbal Recognition Memory (VRM) Phase I and Delayed Verbal Recall recognition measures the ability to encode and subsequently retrieve verbal information. Eighteen (18) words are presented,  and subjects are subsequently asked 
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -015  July 11, 2023 
Amendment 10 CuraSen Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 of 77  to recall them; this is re peated 2 times.  Forty -five (45) minutes later free recall test 
and forced- choice recognition test are carried out.  
• The Adaptive Tracking Task (ATT) measures visuomotor coordination and vigilance. 
In this test, a small circle (target) will continuously move  across the screen in a semi -
randomized fashion, so as to minimize the subject’s ability to predict the trajectory of 
the target. The subject is instructed to use his/her finger upon the touch screen to move a small dot so that it is consistently within th e center of the moving target on 
the screen. During the test, the speed of the circle is adjusted in response to the subject’s ability to keep the dot in the circle, ensuring that the test is adapted to the individual subject.  
• The Paired Associates Learni ng (PAL) task is a measure of visuo- spatial epi[INVESTIGATOR_369900]. The task becomes 
gradually more difficult, benchmarking a subject’s memory capacity. Subjects have to remember the location of an abstract p attern in a specific location.  
• The Stop Signal Task (SST) measures response inhibition (impulse control). The subjec t must respond to an arrow stimulus, by [CONTACT_369954], 
depending on the direction in which the arrow points. If an audio tone is present, the subject must withhold making that response (inhibition). 
 
 Phonological Verb al Fluency Test  (pVFT)  
Verbal fluency tests are widely used for assessing executive function and requires the 
generation of words from initial letters (phonological verbal fluency) or belonging to a 
specific category (semantic fluency), under a time constraint ( Harrison 2000). The specific 
versions of verbal fluency used in this study are t he ‘ALPHABET’ and ‘CATEGORY’ tests 
from the Brief And Simple Index of Cognition (BASIC) (Metis Cognition, Ltd., Warminster, [LOCATION_006]).  
For the ALPHABET task, subjects are given [ADDRESS_462893] words generated. 
For the CATEGORY task, subjects are given 1 minute to say aloud as many animals they can 
think of, avoiding repetitions. The total score is the number of animals generated.  
 Facial Expression Recognition Task (FERT)  
The Facial Expression Recognition Task assesses the recognition of facial emotions. Faces with six different basic emotions (happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], fear, anger, disgust, sadness, surprise ) are 
briefly displayed on the screen and participants are required to indicate the expression of the face via a button -press. Different intensity levels of each emotion are presented, which 
increases the ambiguity of the facial expression and the sensitivity of the task. Early change 
in measures of emotional bias in depressed patients treated with antidepressants has been 
positively correlated with the improvement in patients’ symptoms of depression across a full

the use of the FERT may be predictive of antidepressant response. 
 Color Trails Test  (Select Sites Only)  
The Color Trails Test consists of n umbered circles printed with vivid pi[INVESTIGATOR_369901]-blind individuals.  For Part 1, the respondent uses a 
pencil to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_369902] 1-25 in sequence.  For Part 2, the respondent

5.4. Concomitant Medications  
Subjects who require routine medication to manage and treat concurrent conditions (e.g., hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], diabetes, hypertension, Parkinson’s Disease, Alzheimer’s Disease) 
must be on stable doses [ADDRESS_462894] be recorded. The 
Medical Monitor or designee should be notified in advance of (or as soon as possible after) any instances in which prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_23730]. 
Prohibited concomitant medications include the following:

lisdexamfetamine . 
• Subjects who had prior treatment with any investigational drug ≤90 days prior to dosing (Day - 1), or ≤5 half -lives of the drug (whichever is longer) will be excluded. 
• Subjects should not receive the influenza vaccine within 2 weeks of the Screening visit through to the End -of-Study Visit.  
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_369907] 30 days prior to Screening and throughout the study. 
 
5.5. Escape/Rescue Medications  
Since CST -[ADDRESS_462897] nadolol 
(CST -107) , the typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] β -AR agonist effects such as HR increases,  are unlikely to occur. 
However, if there are intolerable HR/BP increases subjects may be administered rescue nadolol.  
Nadolol has been successfully used in ongoing or previous CuraSen studies to block the 
peripheral effects of CST -2032 and other β -AR agonists.  
5.6. Contraception  
Female subjects of childbearing potential (i.e ., not postmenopausal or not surgically sterile) 
and all male participants with sexual partners of childbearing potential must use reliable 
methods of birth control during their participation in the study.  
Unless confirmed to be azoospermic (vasectomized or secondary to medical cause), male 
subjects must agree to use a male condom from Day -1 throughout the study when having 
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -[ADDRESS_462898] administration of 
study medication. 
Acceptable methods of contraception for female subjects of child-bearing potential study 
include the following:  
• Use of highly effective birth control, including hormonal prescription oral 
contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch,  contraceptive implant, 
contraceptive ring, intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone- releasing system, dual 
barrier method (e.g., condoms, or diaphragm, or cervical cap when used with 
spermicide), or 
• monogamous relationship with a male partner of confirmed sterility, or 
• practice complete abstinence, i.e., refrain from sexual intercourse.  
 
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  
Females of non -childbearing potential may be enrolled if it is documented that they are 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea for ≥12 months) and follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) ≥ 25 
IU/L, or have undergone surgical sterilization, including hyst erectomy, bilateral 
oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or Essure procedure. Females with FSH <25 IU/L must agree to contraception from Day -[ADDRESS_462899] a causal relationship with this treatment. AE s 
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -[ADDRESS_462900], or ot her means.   
AEs include: 
• Any new undesirable medical experience or an unfavorable and unintended change of an existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered related to study medication. 
• Abnormal laboratory findings considered by [CONTACT_16426], i.e., those that are unusual for the population being studied or individual subject.  
• Complications and termination of pregnancy; uncomplicated pregnancies are not 
considered AE s but must still be reported. 
 
Additionally, events (including intercurrent illnesses) occurring from the time of 
randomization will be documented on the AE CRF. Concurrent illnesses, which existed prior 
to first dose  in the clinical trial, will not be considered A Es unless they worsen during the 
treatment period.  
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death . 
• Is life -threatening (this means that the subj ect is at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe) . 
• Requires or prolongs subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that does not otherwise meet the criteria for seriousness. 
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding if an event is serious if it 
does not meet the above definitions, such as an important medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369908]. Specific examples 
of such eve nts are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
A distinction should be drawn between seriousness and severity of an AE. An AE that is 
assessed as severe, for example, should not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of the event (see below); both AEs and SAEs will be assessed 
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -015  July 11, 2023 
Amendment 10 CuraSen Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 of 77  for severity grading. An event is defined as “serious” when it meets one of the predefined 
outcomes as described above. 
6.1.2. Assessment of Adverse Events  
Each event recorded on the AE CRF will be assessed by [CONTACT_369955]. 
 Severity  
Severity of AE s will be graded as one of:  
• Mild:  Awareness of sig ns or symptoms but easily tolerated. A type of AE that is 
usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. 
• Moderate:  A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. 
• Severe:  Incapacitating the ability  to do work or to do activities. A type of AE that 
interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
 
 Relationship to Study Medication 
The Investigator or designee, using clinical judgment, will assess the causality/relationship 
between each AE and the most recently administered study medication  (i.e., whether there is 
a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event) and record that assessment in the CRF.  
Unrelated : The AE is clearly not related to the study medication. The AE is clearly explained 
by [CONTACT_5748], or exposure to the study medication has not occurred.  Related : The AE may be related to the study medication. The AE and administration of the 
study medication are considered reasonably related in time, but the AE is more likely 
explained by [CONTACT_369956]. 
AE reporting will extend from randomization until completion of the End -of-Study Visit. 
AEs occurring after the end of the clinical trial must be reported if the Investigator considers 
there is a causal relationship with the study medication.  
All A Es, regardless of the relationship to study medication, will be recorded in the CRF.  
All reports should contain a brief description of the event, date of onset, date of resolution, 
severity, treatment required, relationship to study medication, outcome, and whether the 
event is classified as serious. Whenever possible, the Investigator should group signs or 
symptoms that constitute a single diagnosis into a single event term. For example, “cough, rhinitis, and sneezing” might be grouped together as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092].” 
A treatment -emergent clinically significant abnormal labo ratory value should be recorded as 
an AE.  
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -[ADDRESS_462901] be reported 
within 24 hours by [CONTACT_756], e- mail, or fax to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor and/or 
Sponsor’s designee using the appropriate contact [CONTACT_344829]. The minimum information 
required for an initial report is: 
• Sender of report (name, address of Investigator), 
• Subject identification (subject number, NOT subject name), 
• Protocol number, 
• Description of SAE and date of onset, 
• Relationship assessment , 
• Date of visit and study visit number, 
• Current status of subject. 
 
However, whenever possible, all points on the SAE form should be completed and the form 
faxed or scanned and emailed to the Sponsor or designee. The site should also notify the 
Sponsor or designee by [CONTACT_369957]. In addition, the event must be documented in the CRF.  
It is recognized that it may be difficult to differentiate the relationship of an adverse event to CST-[ADDRESS_462902] -107 (nadolol).  There is a long history of the clinical safety of nadolol 
and the dose of nadolol being administered in this study is less than 1 0% of the labeled 
starting dose for treatment of angina pectoris or hypertension (3 mg versus 40 mg).  Therefore, unless the PI [INVESTIGATOR_369909] -107 (e.g., for an AE 
that occurs prior to administration of CST-2032), all assessments of  related AEs will be attributed to CST -2032 for expedited reporting purposes. 
After receipt of the initial report, the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee will review the information and, if necessary, contact [CONTACT_369958]. The Sponsor or designee will be responsible for all information 
processing and reporting according to local legal requirements.  
The Sponsor or designee will determine the SAEs requiring expedited reporting to regulatory 
agencies. The clinical trial site personnel are responsible for reporting these events to their 
Ethics Committee in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  
6.1.4. Follow- up of Adverse Events  
All A Es and SAEs experienced by a subject, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be 
monitored until the event has resolved, until any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or stabilized at a level acceptable to the Investigator and Medical  Monitor. Any SAE 
that occurs after final visit but is felt to be related to the study medication by [CONTACT_369959]2032/CST107- CLIN -[ADDRESS_462903] be 
followed by [CONTACT_185683].  
6.2. Clinical Safety Laboratory Abnormalities  
Blood and urine samples for routine safety laboratory parameters will be collected at 
timepoints specified in the Schedule of Events. The Investigator will document review of all 
labs and will determine and document clinical significance. All abnormal laboratory values that are clinically significant, treatment-emergent, and meet one of the following conditions (as determined by [CONTACT_737]) should be recorded as a single AE:  
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659], or 
• Requires a change in concomitant therapy  
 
6.3. ECG Abnormalities  
All ECG s  will be evaluated  by a central ECG reader and the Investigator in consultation 
with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor to det ermine if the abnormality is significant and 
whether it is safe for the subject to continue in the study. 
6.4. Pregnancy  
Female subjects who become pregnant during the study period must be discontinued from the 
study. Pregnancy in a study subject should be reported by [CONTACT_13658] 1 business 
day to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_49850] a contraceptive medicat ion.  
Any female subject or partner of a male study subject who becomes pregnant during the trial will be asked to agree to regular reporting of the progress and outcome of her pregnancy to 
the Investigator (or designee) and Sponsor. Monitoring of the pregnant subject or partner 
should continue until the outcome (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth , or congenital abnormality) of the pregnancy is known and documented even if 
the subject was discontinued from the study.  
All
 reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.   Spont
aneous miscarriages 
should also be reported and handled as SAEs.   El
ective abortions without complications 
should not be handled as AEs.

7.2.2. Blinding   
This clinical trial is a double-blinded study, with the Sponsor, subjects, and site personnel 
(e.g., study nurses, coordinators, investigators) blinded to treatment assignment. Limited staff will have access to treatment assignments, such as th e unblinded statistical team, I WRS  
system administration,  and drug supply management team.  
A subject’s  treatment  assignment should only be unblinded by [CONTACT_978]
 [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or by [CONTACT_369960]’s  
Medical Monitor when knowledge of the treatment is essential  for the further  
management  of the subject or may impact  the safety  of subjects currently  enrolled. 
Unblinding for any other reason  will be considered a  protocol violation. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_369910]’s  treatment  assignment  but must  do so within  [ADDRESS_462915]’s  source records.  
CST-[ADDRESS_462916]-107 and its matching placebo:  
• CST-[ADDRESS_462917] is randomized to receive and the treatment period in w hich they are participating. 
• CST-[ADDRESS_462918] will supply 1 week (+3 extra days) of dosing of CST-2032/placebo and 
1 week (+2 extra days) of dosing for CST-107/placebo blister or bottle .  
The clinical label will identify the product by [CONTACT_2300], lot number, Sponsor, and storage 
conditions. The blister  or bottle labels will include the investigational drug caution statement: 
“Caution: New Drug - Limited by [CONTACT_4496] ([LOCATION_002]) Law to Investigational Use Only .” 
7.2.4. Storage and Handling  
Study medication s will be stored in a secure, controlled- access location at the study site.  
Study medications will be stored and handled at the clinical site in accordance with 
instructions in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -[ADDRESS_462919]-2032/matching placebo  will be stored at refrigerated temperature 36 °F–46°F ( 2–8°C).  
Minor excursions are permitted (down to 0°C and up to 25°C for up to 60 minutes) and 
should be recorded within the pharmacy temperature logs.  Excursions longer than [ADDRESS_462920]-107/matching placebo will be stored at controlled room temperature 59°F–77°F (15–
25°C) with excursions allowed up to 86°F (30°C) for not longer than 48 hours (continuous). 
The Sponsor must be notified immediately of any temperature excursions or damage to study 
medication s.  
Temperature monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the study 
medication s are maintained within an established temperature range. The Investigator(s) is 
responsible for ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the total duration of the 
trial and that records are maintained; the tem perature should be monitored continuously by 
[CONTACT_369961], a mechanical recording device, such as a calibrated chart recorder, or by [CONTACT_3177], such that minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded and retrieved as required.  
8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

9. ETHICAL, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS  
9.1. Data Quality Assurance  
The Sponsor or designee will conduct eithe r an in -person or virtual site visit to verify the 
qualifications of each Investigator, according to Sponsor’s or designee’s applicable standard 
operating procedure, inspect the site facilities, and inform the Investigator of responsibilities and the procedures for ensuring adequate and correct documentation. 
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical trial for each 
clinical trial subject . All information recorded on the CRFs for this clinical trial must be 
consistent with the subjects’ source documentation (i.e., medical records). 
9.2. Case Report Forms and Source Documentation  
Data obtained during this clinical trial should be promptly entered in the electronic CRF  
(eCRF) . All source documents from which e CRF  entries are derived will be placed in the 
subject’s medical records. A n eCRF will be completed for every subject who  was screened 
for participation in the clinical trial. Measurements for which source documents are available 
include vital signs, physical exams, laboratory assessments and ECG recordings. 
A representative of the Sponsor or designee (a Site Monitor) will visit the clinical trial center 
periodically to monitor adherence to the protocol and to applicable regulatory regulations, and the maintena nce of adequate and accurate clinical records. The eCRFs will be reviewed 
in detail, for which the Site Monitor will have access to subject medical records, laboratory data, and other source documentation. Remote monitoring may be utilized in some circumstances.  The Site Monitor will make a decision as to their acceptability. If errors or 
omissions are found in the course of a data review, or if clarification of data is required, the eCRFs in question will be corrected by [CONTACT_18370].

Investigator will sign and date the completed e CRF. This signature [CONTACT_369988] [CONTACT_369975] s of 
the form.  
9.3. Access to Source Data  
During the course of the clinical trial, Sponsor representatives, Site Monitors, FDA, EC/ IRB, 
and/or the Sponsor’s Quality Assurance Group or designee must have direct access to source 
data to review protocol compliance, compare CRFs and individual subject’s medical records, 
assess drug accountability, and ensure that the clinical trial is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements. CRF entries will be verified with source documentation. 
The review of medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that subject 
confidentiality is maintained. The Investigator will ensure that the Sponsor is provided with all necessary support at all times.  
9.4. Data Processing  
All data will be entered using an appropriate data entry system, following standard procedures. 
The data review and data -handling document will include specifications for consistency and 
plausibility checks of data and will also include data-handling rules for obvious data errors.  
9.5. Archiving Clinical Trial Records  
According to ICH guidelines, essential documents will be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_462931] approval of a marketing application in an ICH region.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator and clinical trial staff to ma intain a comprehensive 
and centralized filing system of all clinical trial-related documentation. This centralized file 
should be available for inspection at any time by [CONTACT_1034], Site Monitor or the Sponsor’s Quality Assurance staff  or designee for mon itoring or auditing by [CONTACT_369976]. Elements of clinical trial documentation will include: 
• Subject files containing the completed eCRF supporting source documentation and the 
signed informed consent form ( ICF). 
• Clinical trial files, containing the protocol with all amendments, the IB , copi[INVESTIGATOR_369912], and all correspondence to and from the EC/ IRB and the 
Investigator. 
• Pharmacy files, containing the Study Medication Accountability Records or dispensation logs and all clinical trial agent- related correspondence.  
 
9.6. Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this clinical trial protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor 
and Investigator abide by [CONTACT_369977]2032/CST107- CLIN -015  July 11, 2023 
Amendment 10 CuraSen Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 70 of 77  federal/national and local regulations. The clinical trial also will be carried out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_369913].  
9.7. Informed Consent  
Before each subject is screened, written informed consent must be obtained from the subject. 
The informed consent forms (ICFs) must be signed and dated and retained by [CONTACT_369978]. The Investigator will not undertake any investigation 
specifically requ ired for the clinical trial until valid consent has been obtained. The terms of 
the consent and when it was obtained must also be documented in the CRF. Each subject will 
receive a fully signed copy of each consent form that he/she signs for the clinical t rial. 
If a protocol amendment is required, the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes to 
the protocol. If the consent form is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_82574]/ IRB and signed by [CONTACT_369979], as 
well as those currently enrolled in the clinical trial.  
9.8. Protocol Approval and Amendment  
Before the start of the clinical trial, the clinical trial protocol and/or other relevant documents will be approved by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. The 
Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first subject is screened for the clinical trial.  
The procedures outlined in the protocol and eCRFs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_369980]. 
No deviations from the protocol should be made except in emergency situations in which 
alternative treatment is necessary for the protection, p roper care, and well -being of subjects. 
To alter the protocol, amendments must be written, and approvals must be received from the 
appropriate personnel. Amendments will originate from Sponsor and will be provided to the 
Investigator  for submission to the EC/ IRB for review and approval prior to implementation. 
If a protocol amendment substantially alters the clinical trial design or increases potential risk 
to the study subject, the ICF should be revised and, if applicable, subject’s consent to 
continue participation should be obtained. 
Administrative changes may be made without the need for a formal amendment.  
9.9. Study Medication Accountability  
9.9.1. Handling of Study Medications 
The Investigator shall take adequate precautions, including storage of the study medications 
in a securely locked, substantially constructed cabinet or other securely locked, substantially 
constructed enclosure (or a locked refrigerator for CST -2032) , access to which is l imited, to 
prevent theft or diversion of the substances into illegal channels of distribution.  
Protocol CST2032/CST107- CLIN -[ADDRESS_462932] be provided to the Sponsor.  
9.10. Confidentiality  
All clinical trial findings and documents will be regarded as confidential. The Investigator and members of his/her research team must not disclose such information without prior written approval from the Sponsor. 
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained, and national requirements and 
guidelines must be followed. Subjects will be identified on eCRFs and other documents by 
[CONTACT_139927], sex and/or birth date, not by [CONTACT_369981]. Documents that identify the subject (e.g., the signed informed consent) must be maintained in confidence by [CONTACT_737].  
9.11. Publication Policy  
By [CONTACT_169063], the Investigator agrees with the use of results of the clinical trial for the purposes of national and international registration, publication, and information for medical and pharmaceutical professionals. If necessary, the authorities will be notified of the Investigator's name, address, qualifications, and extent of involvement.

medical degree.
Chronic kidney disease not requiring dialysis (CKD) is common, but under-recognized, among patients who frequent the health care system, where improving patient 
safety is a high priority. Poor recognition of the disease and several other features unique to CKD make it a high-risk condition for adverse, patient-safety incidents 
(PSIs). In this context, PSIs refer to events of unintended harm or injury related to medications or medical care. These adverse safety events may include those usually 
cited for the general population (PSI), but also, CKD-specific unsafe practices (CKD-PSI) all of which, in turn, can lead to frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], accelerated loss of 
kidney function, increased risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and death - all common outcomes in CKD. CKD-PSIs have been established in prior work by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_88129]-PSIs occur or how to possibly measure these reliably in the CKD population. 
Furthermore, it is not known what role poor disease recognition plays in the occurrence of such safety events. Finally, it remains to be determined whether CKD-PSIs 
contribute to the high frequency of adverse outcomes so common in this disease. If CKD-PSIs are common and account for a significant portion of the adverse events so 
common in this population, then it is possible that by [CONTACT_88142]-PSIs, through increased disease recognition, outcomes can be improved in this 
patient population. 
In this study, volunteers were enrolled from the population with pre-dialysis CKD for the purpose of observing the frequency of CKD-PSI in the target population detected 
over time. The participants were assessed every [ADDRESS_96138] 
100 participants (Phase I) were provided with a standard medical alert accessory (bracelet or necklace) which is commonly used to alert doctors and other providers of a 
patient's disease state. In this case the medical alert accessory stated "Decreased Kidney Function. For My Care, Please Visit www.safekidneycare.org" Participants 
were asked to log onto a website using a unique 4-digit ID assigned by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_88130]. Since all information on 
the website was available to the public, participants are not required to use the ID to access the content of the website. The website did not collect or store patient health 
information, except for the IP address which provides limited information on the location of the computer used to access the website (city, state, zip, and area code). 
The volunteers in Phase I were tracked over time as to whether they accept and tolerated the medical alert bracelet/necklace and for their incidence of CKD-PSI. 
Enrollment continued after Phase I into Phase II (n = 250) with Phase II participants tracked on an identical study schedule for detection of CKD-PSI. All study 
procedures are the same for Phase II except for the medical alert accessory. The overall goal of this study will be to determine the frequency of CKD-PSI in the target 
population, the acceptability of an alert device (Phase I only) intended to increase the recognition of CKD, and the contribution of CKD-PSI to the high incidence of 
adverse outcomes in CKD.
Due to limited funding, beginning July 1, 2016, annual clinic visits stopped and study procedures were reduced to one, brief annual telephone follow-up to continue 
capture
• Self-reported safety events leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]/ER visits,
• Death and cause of death,
• Onset of end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy (dialysis and/or kidney transplant), and 
• Updated contact [CONTACT_3031]
• Frequency and severity of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_88131]-noted elements will continue for an additional 5 years through December 2021.

1* Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives of this research. State the hypothesis to be tested:
In this study, 371 individuals with pre-dialysis CKD were consented to achieve a cohort of 350 that proceeded to study procedures with the following objectives: 
1) Assess the Tolerability and Efficacy of a Commonly-used Medical Alert Accessory Designed to Increase Recognition of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_88132] 108 subjects of the Safe Kidney Care cohort (Phase I) were provided a medical alert accessory (choice of bracelet or necklace, stainless steel or sterling silver). 
Regular contacts were made with Phase I participants to monitor tolerance of medical alert accessory along with the use of a supplemental informational website on best 
safe practices for patients with CKD, and to measure the frequency of newly-developed Patient Safety Indicators specific to CKD (CKD-PSI). 
2) Validate Established CKD-PSIs in a Cohort of Individuals with CKD Tracked Longitudinally 
After enrollment in Phase I has concluded, an additional 242 volunteers from the target population were enrolled into the Safe Kidney Care cohort (Phase II) for a total of 
[ADDRESS_96139] the incidence of established CKD-PSIs, assess their measurability, and exam the relationship between the occurrence of 
these safety events and adverse renal outcomes. 
2* Discuss the research design including but not limited to such issues as: probability of group assignment, potential for subject 
to be randomized to placebo group, use of control subjects, etc.:
Study design: Observational cohort study. Study population: Persons with Stage III – V, pre-dialysis CKD enrolled from a single center (n = 350). The first 108 
participants (Phase I) were provided a medical alert accessory (choice of bracelet or necklace). 
Study Measurements: Participants in both Phase I and II underwent baseline and annual in-center visits for medical history and medication review, anthropometric 
measures, measurement of renal function (serum Cr for estimation of GFR); other laboratory measures, measures of physical function and health literacy, and other 
questionnaires. Additionally, they had a follow-up telephone call between annual visits to review medications, update contact [CONTACT_3031], assess for medical events and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Phase I participants also had an assessment of medical alert accessory acceptance and tolerance. The expected duration of study allows up to [ADDRESS_96140] the 
annual telephone visit up to December 2021. The mid-year telephone follow-up will stop.
Primary outcomes: CKD-PSIs including medication errors (such as NSAIDs, improperly dosed meds), toxic exposures (such as contrast agents), and medical events 
(such as hyperkalemia or hypoglycemia); Secondary outcomes: including changing renal function, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ESRD, and death. Phase I participants were followed 
for acceptance and tolerance of medical alert accessory.

Refer to Protocol item 5. BACKGROUND 
4* Provide the scientific or scholarly background, rationale, and significance of the research and how it will add to existing 
knowledge:
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, but under-recognized, among patients in the health care system, where improving patient safety is a high priority. Poor 
disease recognition and several other features of CKD make it a high risk condition for adverse safety events. These adverse safety events may include those usually 
cited for the general population (PSI), but also, CKD-specific poor outcomes including unsafe practices and errors (CKD-PSI) specific to the unique care that CKD 
patients receive. These in turn, have the potential to lead to frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], accelerated loss of renal function, increased risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), 
and death. Our overall hypothesis is that poor disease recognition leads to an increased occurrence of CKD-PSI which in turn contributes to the high rate of adverse 
events seen in this population. This study proposes to address key elements of this overall hypothesis. These include determining the frequency of previously 
established CKD-PSI (see HP00042985) in the target population and determine the extent that these CKD-PSIs contribute to adverse disease outcomes. Furthermore, it 
will evaluate the longitudinal acceptance and tolerance of a commonly-used medical alert accessory intended to alert providers to a disease state and increase CKD 
recognition with supplemental information on the safe care of patients with CKD (www.safekidneycare.org).

not in the study) and when they are performed, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safety or to 
minimize risks: 
Beginning July 1, 2016, Mod 11 replaces the annual clinic visit with a 10-15 minute telephone call and eliminates the mid-year telephone follow-up visit. In addition, study 
procedures were also drastically reduced and are now restricted to the following data collection at the annual telephone visit:
• Self-reported safety events leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]/ER visits,
• Death and cause of death,
• Onset of end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy (dialysis and/or kidney transplant), and 
• Updated contact [CONTACT_88143] 12 adds the Clarke Hypoglycemia Index_Questionnaire_6.20.2016 to the above data collection to measure frequency and severity of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].
Every effort will be made to complete all visits within target range; however, we anticipate that some participants will miss some annual telephone visits due to 
unforeseen circumstances, such as illness or family events. At each encounter with the participant, we will attempt to collect all information on events that have occurred 
since the last encounter and complete data collection. Outlined below are the study procedures and questionnaires.
Participant and Designated Proxy Contact [CONTACT_7171] - participants will be asked to provide their preferred methods to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], such as mailing address, telephone 
numbers, and email address. In addition, we will request that the participant provide the contact [CONTACT_88144], who can provide information to the participant’s status, such as moved, ill, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], or deceased. This information is collected at each annual telephone 
follow-up visit. 
Self-Reported Safety Events Questionnaire - this questionnaire tracks symptoms or medical problems that might be related to self- or medically-directed care and the 
frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. 
Clarke Hypoglycemia Index_Questionnaire -Mod 12 adds one additional questionnaire, the Clarke Hypoglycemia Index_Questionnaire. This instrument will be 
administered beginning July 1, 2016 at the annual, telephone follow-up. Patients with diminished kidney function and diabetes are at risk for hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. The 
Clarke Hypoglycemia Index will provide information about the level of “unawareness” and ability to self-recover and avoid a patient safety event.

Sample Size and Data Analysis
If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable 
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below.
1* Provide the rationale and sample size calculations for the proposed target population:
From PI's Protocol, Section 9.I.4, page 30:
9.I.4. Sample Size Considerations
For this study, the key aim of the power calculations will be to ensure adequate precision in the detected estimates of CKD-PSIs. In order to conduct such power 
calculations it is important to make reliable assumptions about the expected incidence rate of key disease-specific safety indicators. 
The preliminary data presented offers evidence of the expected incidence rate of selected events. The estimated incidence of various CKD-specific safety events 
reported by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_88135] 14.8% of participants, with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_51943] (glucose ≤ 60 mg/dl) in a given year, to 30% with a medication error in a given year . 
When considering a composite of a series of prospective, disease-specific safety indicators, one can see that the expected incidence rate could be substantial. Yet, to 
determine the precision of incidence estimates of CKD-PSIs in the validation cohort, we varied the presumed baseline rate from a conservative low frequency to a range 
closer to what is suggested by [CONTACT_77886] (Table 4 on page 31 of PI's protocol and below). Choosing the sample size for Phase II cohort of 250 (final n 242), 
achieved confidence interval, across our projections for a baseline incidence rate, assures a high degree of precision in measured event rates for CKD-PSIs. 
The additional sample of 110 (final n 108) participants for pi[INVESTIGATOR_88136] (Phase 1) will provide a reasonable estimate of the acceptance and 
tolerability of the alert accessory.

how the analyses proposed will relate to the primary purposes of the study:
From Protocol:
9.I.3. Statistical Analysis 
The purpose of this analysis will be to measure the incidence of the CKD-PSIs in the study cohort and to determine the adjusted incidence rates across key factors which 
relate to safety in CKD. Event ascertainment will begin 4 months (with first telephone follow-up) after enrollment at which time individual events will be recorded 
longitudinally and cumulatively. 
We will consider each specific type of event as an endpoint, but the primary analysis will be based on a composite endpoint of all CKD-PSIs endorsed for inclusion in the 
trial. The incidence of the events will be expressed per patient-months accrued for all participants in the study cohort and cumulative incidence rates will be determined 
for both the composite and individual events. Each event will be recorded per individual at the time of the event. For example, if there was an epi[INVESTIGATOR_88137] a participant enrolled in January, and an exposure to NSAID in December, then that individual will have [ADDRESS_96142] the incidence of patient 
safety events. For this analysis, there will be no predetermined primary exposure to be tested in the regression analysis; however, a key analysis will be the relationship 
between entry GFR and incidence of CKD-PSIs. Other exposures of interest will be examined. The Poisson regression will assume the number of events for each 
subject follows a Poisson distribution with mean being a product of the length of the follow-up period and the rate of events, where the logarithm of the expected rate of 
events (per patient-month), is the linear combination of the covariates. We will check whether data display any over-dispersion and may use negative-binomial regression 
model if over-dispersion is present. 
The data will also be structured such that it is possible to explore the relationship between the incidence of CKD-PSIs and key renal endpoints (secondary outcomes). 
The key adverse secondary outcomes measures to be examined will be 1) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478], 2) rate of change in renal function, as measured by [CONTACT_88145]. For 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the primary measure will be incidence of unique hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88138]-months in each group. Comparisons groups will be the patient-
months labeled by [CONTACT_88146]-PSIs in a given patient. While an individual without any CKD-PSI during study observation has a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], that event occurs in the non-PSI group, another individual with at least one CKD-PSI in the study period who has two hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] – one before and 
the other after the incidence of the CKD-PSI – will contribute two hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88139]. The first will be assigned to the non-CKD- PSI group and 
corresponding to the period from entry to the occurrence of the first CKD-PSI, the second event will be assigned to CKD-PSI group and corresponding to the period from 
the occurrence of the first CKD-PSI to last follow up time or the end of the study. 
Generalized estimating equations (GEE) with log link function will be employed for examination of the relationship between incidence of CKD-PSIs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
GEE will allow for joint modeling of the repeated measures and the incorporation of such a time-varying covariate based in the detection of a CKD-PSI. The effect of ever 
experiencing CKD-PSI during the study period on the frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88140] 95% confidence interval of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88141]-PSI group.
Estimated GFR will be determined at baseline and at all annual follow-up visits. Since enrollment will be planned to ensure at least one follow-up visit per individual, it will 
be possible to generate slope estimates for change in renal function in all study participants. Measurement of serum creatinine will be done at a single laboratory to 
minimize variation in calibration across laboratories, and GFR will be estimated with the modified MDRD equation. Proper transformation will be performed as needed if 
the distribution of GFR values is skewed. Random effects models will be used to compare change in GFR between those with and without a CKD-PSI. To employ 
random effects models as a means to compare change in renal function between those participants with and without the incidence of a CKD-PSI and adjust for multiple 
covariates, the following assumptions will be made: 
Each individual will have a separate slope βi, with an independent intercept αi, and an error term ε I with mean 0 and a Normal distribution. The residual variance of each 
slope is assumed to be the same across all individual slopes and the distribution of βi for participant time assigned to each group is assumed to be a Normal distribution 
with a mean of b1 or b2 corresponding to the two groups (without or with the bracelet/necklace). Similarly, the distribution of individual intercept αi is assumed to be a 
Normal distribution with an equal variance across all individuals, and a mean of a1 or a2 corresponding to the two groups. 
The random effects model will allow for inclusion of both baseline and time-varying covariates which would include timing of the incidence of the CKD-PSI. In comparison 
of change in renal function across the two groups (CKD-PSI vs never CKD-PSI), we will test whether the mean slopes b1 and b2 are equal, and construct a 95% 
confidence interval for d= b2 - b1. For these analyses, we will employ PROC MIXED in SAS V9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]), building on the research group’s 
substantial prior experience using such models and examining changes in renal function.

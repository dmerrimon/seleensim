Estimated Time to Complete 
Enrollment:  Approximately [ADDRESS_700599] been identified worldwide. [1] As of  
October 11 , 2021,  there were ~ 44 million cases and over 715,000  deaths associated 
with COVID -19 in the [LOCATION_002]. [2] While many individuals have asymptomatic or 
mild to moderate respi[INVESTIGATOR_537856] -limiting, significant morbidity and mortality 
are markedly increased in older individuals or those have underlying chronic illness such 
as cardiovascular and pul monary diseases and diabetes. Treatment relies  primarily on 
supportive therapy with the addition of remdesivir  and monoclonal antibodies approved 
under emergency use authorization and dexamethasone in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]. [3]  
 
Research on strategies to treat or prevent the  disease have focused on nonpregnant 
adults, leaving pregnant  women and their obstetric providers without the knowledge or 
tools needed to adequately care for them, their  fetus es, and their soon- to-be born 
infants. Initial reports from China did not suggest an increase in maternal or  infant 
mortality. However, several  publications since suggest that pregnant women are  at 
higher risk for  severe disease including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ICU admission, and mechanical 
ventilation. [4] Additionally, racial and ethnic dispari ties of COVID -19 cases in the United 
States  are similar to the general population, with non- Hispanic black and Hispanic 
pregnant women having a higher risk of COVID -19 disease. [5] In addition, the high 
incidence of known risk factors for disease severity  during pregnancy (hypertension, 
diabetes, and obesity) add to the risk of COVID -19 in pregnant women in the  United 
States . Currently remdesivir and dexamethasone are used for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_537857] -19 infection, though pregnant women remain systematically 
excluded from all other investigational treatment  trials.  
 
The US Department of Health and Human Services announced the framework for 
Operation Warp Speed (OWS) on May 15, 2020, with the goal of delivering safe and 
efficacious vaccine to prevent COVID -19 by [CONTACT_36466] 2021. Vaccines were developed 
and tested in clinical trials at a historic pace and in December 2020 and February  2021 
FDA authorized three COVID -19 vaccines under Emerg ency Use Authorizations 
(EUAs). [6]  Two are mRNA vaccines: [COMPANY_007] -BioNTech  mRNA vaccine, for use in 
persons aged ≥16 years and Moderna for use in persons aged ≥18 years. [7, 8]  The 
third Janssen COVID -19 vaccine uses a replication- deficient adenovirus (Ad26) vector 
and is authorized for persons aged ≥18 years .[9] Following the EUAs, these vaccines 
were recommended by [CONTACT_537869]. [10] 
 
Pregnant women were excluded from the clinical trials supporting these EUAs. None of 
the currently authorized COVID -19 vaccines are live virus vaccines , and the EUAs do 
not contraindicate vaccination in pregnant women. CDC’s Inter im Clinical Considerations 
state the following: “ Any of the currently authorized COVID -19 vaccines can be 
administered to pregnant or lactating people; ACIP does not state a product preference.  
Pregnant people may choose to receive a COVID -19 vaccine .”[11] 
  
Limited data on the safety of COVID -19 vaccine in pregnant women has left  experts in 
obstetrics, infectious disease, and infection control and prevention questioning the risk or  
appropriateness for pregnant w omen to continue to work in the healthcare setting. [12]  
Observational Maternal COVID -[ADDRESS_700600] been over 161,000 pregnancies reported in 
CDC’s v -safe post -vaccination health checker.  Data collected from v -safe through 
February 2021 has not indicated any safety concerns based on reactogenicity or adverse events observed in pregnant women.  Side effects in pregnant and nonpregnant 
populations were similar . Additionally, no differences in adverse pregnancy outcomes 
appear when comparing pregnant women participating in the v -safe pregnancy registry 
with the background rate.  Spontaneous abortion rate appears to be consistent between 
women receiving COVID- 19 vaccination during pregnancy and background rate. [13] 
 Overall, 65% of the US  healthcare workforce are women, with nearly 80% of being 
between the ages of 16– 54 years. [14] Additionally,  28.5% of women have at least one 
comorbid condition associated with COVID -19 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (obesity,  hypertension, 
and diabetes). [15] Given all that we know about the disease course and treatments thus 
far, a preventive vaccine would be a far better public health intervention by [CONTACT_537870]- 19 related morbidity and mortality as well as significantly reduce 
healthcare resource utilization.  
1.2 Summary & Rationale  
In clinical practice, the FDA approved the [COMPANY_007] -BioNTech COVID -[ADDRESS_700601] include a study of the [COMPANY_007] -
BioNTech vaccine for women 24 0/7 to  34 0/7 weeks' gestation ( NCT04 754594). [16] 
Additionally, CDC is conducting several studies and activities to monitor the safety of 
COVID -19 in pregnant women. [17] This Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment 
(CISA)  Project  prospective observational st udy in pregnant women will  provide detailed 
reactogenicity information and clinical outcomes data and will complement other 
research and surveillance efforts to better understand the safety of COVID -19 vaccine in 
pregnant women. CISA has experience in observational  and randomized clinical trials of 
vaccines administered during pregnancy.

11 3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Main study design  
This study is  a prospective, observational study to evaluate the safety of COVID -19 
vaccine(s)  in [ADDRESS_700604] dose of  their primary COVID -19 vaccine 
series .. Duke will  serve as the Lead Contractor in conjunction with Cincinnati Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_537858] . With Day 1 serving as the day of 
vaccination, participants will be followed through  Day 7 (total 7 days) for symptoms of 
reactogenicity ; if two doses are administered reactogenicity data will be collected after 
each dose.  For the PO , we will assess adverse birth outcomes  as the primary study 
endpoint. SOs will individually  assess adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth, 
spontaneous abortion, fetal death and neonatal death as  well as solicited reactogenicity 
events and overall maternal SAE s following vaccination.  
3.2 Laboratory studies  
3.2.1 Serologic studies  – We will evaluate pre-  and post -vaccination serologic 
responses in women vaccinated against COVID -19. Prevaccination blood samples will 
be analyzed qualitatively for COVID -19 (SARS- CoV-2) antibody status (pos itive or 
negative) at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_537859] a CLIA -certified lab. 
Postvaccination geometric mean titers ( GMTs ) for each SARS -CoV-2 antigen will be 
calculated. Venous blood (approximately 1 2 mL of blood) will be collected from each 
participant in close proximity to the  first vaccination (up to 3 days  before or after 
vaccination) and approximately [ADDRESS_700605] blood 
draws on Day 1 (before vaccination) and Day 21.   At Duke, maternal and cord blood 
(approximately 12 mL of blood each) collection will be performed at delivery for 
serological analysis. At the other sites, these samples (maternal and cord blood) will be 
collected during delivery only if feasible for similar serological analysis . 
   
3.2.2 Future studies –  In addition to the specified analyses described thus far, there 
might  be other tests or assays that have yet to be identified that might  be important for 
interpreting our study findings or of relevance to maternal -infant health outcomes.  
Therefore, participants will be offered, through an opt -in strategy , to allow for the storage 
of any remaining blood (serum/plasma) after all specified analyses have been 
completed. Additional laboratory assays may test for antibodies against other bacteria or 
viruses, markers of inflammation, or used in research on the health of mothers and 
infants.  Specimens banked for use in other studies  will be linked  to information (including 
identifying information)  that participants provided to the study. Because it is unknown if 
future testing will be of any utility, results of future testing will not be provided. In 
addition, participants will be offered, again through an opt -in strategy, to allow study staff 
to contact [CONTACT_537874].  
 
4 STUDY ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL S 
4.1 Participant  Inclusion Criteria  
Participants  who meet  all of the following criteria will be eligible to participate in 
this interventional  study : 
1. Pregnant women 18– [ADDRESS_700606] dose or only 
dose of COVID -19 vaccine or persons receiving a booster dose of a  COVID -19 
vaccine based on ACIP and ACOG guidelines in response to the FDA EUA  or 
approval  and in conjunction with federal and local vaccination campaign 
distribution plans  
3. Willing to provide informed 
consent in a written or 
electronic format  
4. Gestational age at time of 
consent <[ADDRESS_700607] menstrual period and 
ultrasound dating. Estimated 
due date (EDD) and 
gestational age (GA -EDD) will 
be based on reconciliation of 
“sure” first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) and earliest dating ultrasound.   
If the LMP is uncertain, then the earliest dating ultrasound will be used to 
determine EDD and GA. If the ultrasound derived- EDD is in agreement with sure -
LMP derived EDD ( Table 1), then the LMP -derived EDD is used to determine 
GA. If the ultrasound derived EDD is not in agreement with the LMP -derived 
EDD, the ultrasound -derived EDD is used to determine GA.

COVID -19 vaccine administration will follow site -specific vaccine campaign 
administration guidelines in accordance with current  recommendations from the US Food 
and Drug Administration and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). 
There are no previously published randomized controlled COVID -[ADDRESS_700629] been conducted in pregnant women; however, we do not foresee having a 
significant issue with SAEs  given published observational studies and post -market 
surveillance data. [12, 19, 20] We will monitor study participants for SAEs during the 
protocol -defined surveillance period [i.e., from enrollment through 90 days postpartum] . 
 
An SAE is defined as an AE that meets one of the following conditions:  
• Results  in death  (including spontaneous abortion [ SAB] and fetal death) during  the 
period of protocol -defined  surve illance  
• Is life -threatening (defined as im mediate risk of death  at the time of the  event)  
• Requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213033] -defined surveillance (other than routine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_537862])  
• Results  in congenital  anomaly or birth defect  
• Results  in a persi stent or signif icant maternal or infant disability/in capacity   
• Any other  important  medical  event  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  may be considered  an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical  judgment, the  event  might  jeopardize the participant  and might  require 
medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent  one of the  outcomes listed  above.  
Examples  of such  medical  events  include allergic bronchospasm  requiring  intensive 
treatment in an emergency  room  or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do 
not result  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the  developm ent of drug dependency  or drug 
abuse.  
 Reporting Adverse Events  
SAEs and unanticipated problems will be reported to the CDC and all participating IRBs 
according to institutional requirements. AEs that occur in a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_537863] -19 
vaccination should be reported to CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS)  by [CONTACT_537882], primary care or obstetric provider, or by [CONTACT_464] . 
VAERS reporting will be shared with participants. Study site investigators will assess 
relatedness to vaccine or study procedures (related, possibly related, unlikely related, or 
not related) for SAEs. The study investigators will use their clinical judgement to make 
causality assessments and the final causality assessment decision is the responsibility 
of the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_188927].

October 27, 2021  
 
20 5.3 Biospecimens  Collection & Handling  
5.3.[ADDRESS_700630] blood will be collected during study visits as 
described in Table 2. All blood samples (12  mL) will be collected into serum separator 
tubes and processed as follows:  
• Gently mix the tube by [CONTACT_24518] [ADDRESS_700631] 30 minutes.  
• Centrifuge tube within 1 -2 hours of collection at 2,000 relative centrifugal force 
(RCF) (g) for 10 minutes.  
• Gently remove the blood specimen tube  stopper avoiding serum contamination 
with red blood cells. Using a single -use pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462], transfer 0.5 mL aliquots of serum 
(top layer) into 1.0mL or 1.8 mL cryovials . Up to 5 cryovials  are expected.  
• Attach the study -specific barcode labels to the cryovial aliquots. Numbers should 
be placed lengthwise on the tube.  
• Freeze the cryovials at − 80°C in the temperature- monitored research center 
freezer for future shipment.  
Serum aliquots will be stored until shipment to Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_537864].  
 
6 LABORATORY ANALYSES  
6.1 COVID -19 Laboratory Analysis  
Serum samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_2224] a qualitative  enzyme- linked 
immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) which measures IgG antibody to the SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_700632] an Optical Density (OD) value above the established cut off are 
consider ed positive for antibody. The assay was qualified for use in the Laboratory for 
Specialized Clinical Services at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29349]  (CCHMC) , 
a laboratory that is certified by [CONTACT_397320] (CLIA) 
and College of American Pathologist (CAP)  under US FDA Emergency Use 
Authorization.  
 
Qualitative serologic testing will be completed in periodic batches throughout the course 
of the study and will therefore not be available in real -time or for use in clini cal decision-
making. CCHMC will share participant results with each study site as permitted by [CONTACT_537883]. Study sites may share results with participants as permitted by [CONTACT_8415], CDC, 
and local site regulations.  
 
7 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
In collaboration with [LOCATION_011] Medical Center , Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7725], and CDC , the research team at Duke will oversee the statistical analysis. Data 
will reside on a secure Duke server maintained by [CONTACT_213064] 
(DHTS). For the stu dy, a database will be developed and a dataset for the study without 
personal identifiers will be made available to the CDC upon request.  Duke statisticians 
will develop a comprehensive statistical analysis plan. The summary points of the 
analysis plan ar e presented below.  
Observational Maternal COVID -19 Vaccination Study   Version 3.0 
October 27, 2021  
 
21 7.1 Definitions  
Pregnancy and birth outcomes in this study will be defined by [CONTACT_213065]’s REVITALIZE Obstetric Data Definitions [21], CDC 
national Vital  Statistic System [22] or World Health Organization[ 23] if available.   
Definitions for the component of the primary outcome measures are as follows:  
• Preterm birth —born alive at  less than 37 weeks and 0 days  gesta tion 
• SAB—pregnancy loss prior to 20 weeks 0 days  
• Fetal death —intrauterine death of fetus at or after 20 weeks 0 days  
• Neonatal death—infant death within first 28 days of life  
7.2 Sample Size and Power Estimation  
Because this is an observational  study with no randomization of subjects into 
treatment groups, there will be no formal statistical power or  sample size calculation.  
7.3 Analysis Plan  
7.3.1  Study Populations  – There will be one study population named  the Study Cohort .  
The Study Cohort includes any participant t hat was enrolled and received at least 
one dose of a COVID -19 vaccine.  
 
7.3.2  Primary Objective –  To assess adverse birth outcomes in pregnant women 
vaccinated with COVID -19 vaccine.  Tables will be produced that summarize 
adverse birth outcomes (see definition above) with the number, percentage and 
95% confidence interval. These tables will be broken down by [CONTACT_537884] . A listing of all adverse birth outcomes  will also be presented.  
 
7.3.3  Secondary Objective 1 –  To assess preterm b irths occurring in pregnant women 
vaccinated with COVID -19 vaccine.  Tables will be produced that summarize 
preterm births  with the number, percentage and 95% confidence interval . These 
tables will be broken down by [CONTACT_537885] . 
 
7.3.4  Secondar y Objective  2 – To assess combined fetal and neonatal deaths after 
COVID -19 vaccination.  Tables will be produced that summarize combined fetal 
and neonatal deaths  with the number, percentage  and 95% confidence interval . 
These tables will be broken down by [CONTACT_537885].  
 
7.3.5  Secondary Objective 3 – To assess spontaneous abortions after COVID -19 
vaccination.  Tables will be produced that summarize SABs  with the number, 
percentage and 95% confidence interval. These tables will be broken down by 
[CONTACT_537885] . This will be a subgroup analysis of only those 
participants vaccinated at <20 weeks gestational age.  
 
Observational Maternal COVID -19 Vaccination Study   Version 3.0 
October 27, 2021  
 
22 7.3.6  Secondary Objective 4 –  To assess solicited local and systemic reactogenicity 
events in pregnant women vaccinated with COVID -19 vaccine.  Tables will be 
produced that summarize each solicited local and systemic  reactogenicity event 
by [CONTACT_2241] (none, mild, moderate, and severe), as well as by [CONTACT_537886]. These tables will have the number and percentage for each classification 
and will be for each site and across all sites.  The number and proportion of 
women with one or more severe local or systemic reaction will be presented 
along with a 95% confidence interval. These severe reactions will also be 
provided in a list ing. 
 
7.3.7  Exploratory Objective 1 – To assess SAEs in pregnant women vaccinated with 
COVID -19 vaccine.  Tables will be produced that summarize SAEs  with the 
number, percentage and 95% confidence interval. These tables will be broken 
down by [CONTACT_537885]. A listing of all SAEs  will also be 
presented . 
 
7.3.8  Exploratory Objective 2 – To assess health outcomes through 3 months of age in 
infants born to women vaccinated with COVID -19 vaccine.  Tables will be 
produced that summarize infants with medically  attended adverse events through 
90 days of life after maternal COVID -19 vaccination with the number, percentage 
and 95% confidence interval.  Similar tables will also be made for the p roportion 
of SAEs in infants through 90 days of life. A listing of the medically  attended 
adverse events and SAEs will also be presented.   The aforementioned tables for 
medically -attended adverse events and SAEs wil l also be presented by [CONTACT_537887].  
 
7.3.9  Exploratory Objective 3 – To assess safety profiles in pregnant women 
vaccinated with COVID -19 vaccine by [CONTACT_537865] -19 serostatus (positive 
versus negative).  The tables described for the primary objective, secondary 
objectives, and exploratory objectives 1 and 2 will be presented by [CONTACT_537888] -19 serostatus groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (positive or negative) instead of by [CONTACT_3725]. The 
proportions by [CONTACT_4113] -[ADDRESS_700633] Mantel -Haensz el statistic 
(calculated in Proc Logistic in SAS) at the two- sided alpha= 0.05 level. These 
descriptive analyses might be adjusted by [CONTACT_537889] (need at least n=5 for each category 
breakdown) by [CONTACT_4113] -19 serostatus.  
 
7.3.10  Exploratory Objective 4 – To assess safety profiles in pregnant women 
vaccinated with COVID -19 vaccine by [CONTACT_537890] ( positive COVID -19 
tests , self -reported COVID -19 disease history ). Analyses will follow same 
strategy as described above for Exploratory Objective 3.  
 
If multiple COVID -19 vaccines (e.g., [COMPANY_007], Moderna,  Janssen , or others that may be 
approved in the future)  or booster doses are administered to participants , then tables 
and comparisons as described for Exploratory Objective [ADDRESS_700634]  will be substantial and 
will require a sophisticated, practical and flexible system that can accommodate different 
modes of data collection and several separate linked surveys. The novel Vanderbilt -
designed resource developed specifically for online collection of research information, 
the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform, will be used to design study 
forms, including the reaction forms and short customized questionnaires to collect 
information from study participants . This system will be used by [CONTACT_188951]. All electronic linkages will fulfill regulations for protection of human participants  and requirements to minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality. After initial 
set-up, the work load required for electronic data collection will be substantially reduced 
(description of REDCap resources below). Duke investigators have previously used the 
REDCap system for collection and analysis of large quantities of data. Participants will 
be given the option to fill out their memory aid  either directly in the REDCap system or 
on paper. All study -related documents containing protected health informat ion, e.g. , 
enrollment logs, case report forms, memory aids completed by [CONTACT_19288], will be 
maintained in secure research offices at Duke, which are accessible to research staff 
only.  
 
7.4.1 Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)  
Investigators within the NIH -funded Clinical and Translational Research Unit at 
Vanderbilt have developed REDCap ( http://project -redcap.org/
), to collect and manage 
data for diverse clinical and translational research studies. REDCap was designed 
around the concept of giving research teams an easy method to specify project needs 
and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_174848], web- based applications for collection, management and 
sharing of research data. REDCap accomplishes these key functions through use of a 
single study metadata table referenced by [INVESTIGATOR_44605]- level operational modules. 
Based on this abstracted programming model, databases are developed in an efficient 
manner with little resource investment beyond the creation of a  single data dictionary. 
The concept of metadata -driven application development is well established, and the 
critical factor for successful data collection lies in creating a simple workflow 
methodology allowing research teams to autonomously develop study -related metadata 
in an efficient manner. Of particular interest for this project, a subcomponent of REDCap, the REDCap Survey is designed for studies where data are collected directly from the 
research participant. This will be used with the web- based reaction forms that will be 
Observational Maternal COVID -[ADDRESS_700635] with Duke University, Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213038]. CDC staff will collaborate with the sites to develop the protocol, conduct the 
study, ensure the study is aligned with US Department of Health and Human Services 
(CDC) public health priorities, and analyze the data and disseminate the results. CDC 
may receive access to coded data not containing any directly identifying information.  
 
[ADDRESS_700636] to their institutional review boards.   
The C DC, as the funding agency, supports an exception to the sIRB mandate for the 
participating sites under the provision at 114(b)(2)(ii).  CDC staff will be responsible for 
submitting materials to the CDC IRB for review and for obtaining  reliance on Duke IRB . 
 
To facilitate participant  recruitment at the practices, we will request a waiver of consent  
and HIPAA authorization as per institutional requirements  for ascertainment 
(identification, selection) or recruitment of potential participants  while recording

25 identifiable private health information (PHI)  prior to obtaining the participant’s  consent.  
This information will be obtained from review of the electronic scheduling and medical 
record systems in the clinics  in order to determine eligibility for study enrollment. We will 
review only the minimum amount of information necessary to determine eligibility, i.e. ,

9.1.1  Vulnerable Subjects Research 
Vulnerable subjects  
This study proposes to include pregnant women and neonates.  
 
Pregnant women  
COVID -19 vaccines are provided under a FDA licensure or  EUA and are recommended 
by [CONTACT_29510], ACIP and ACOG  during pregnancy . 
 
The specific procedures to be performed as part of this study are limit ed to minimal 
blood draw ( ≤50 mL over a 4 -week period), and other noninvasive proc edures that are 
commonly performed during routine physical exams and are considered safe for 
pregnant women. These procedures do not pose greater than minimal risk to the fetus.  
 
This study will involve only those women who have given their free and informed 
cons ent in accordance with 45 CFR 46.116.  The small amount of blood that will be 
drawn during the  duration of pregnancy (up to 50 mL) are considered safe and are not 
expected to cause any harm to the baby.  No inducement, monetary or otherwise, will be 
offered to terminate a pregnancy. Individuals engaged in the research will have no part 
in any decisions as to the timing, method , or procedures used to terminate a pregnancy, 
or in determining the viability of a neonate.  
 
Infants  
Identifiable private information will be collected about the infants at the time of delivery.   
Significant infant complications identified during the delivery visit will be followed up to 
90 days of life.  
 
Mothers will be informed about the infant data collection at the time they consent for the 
study, and thus, the consent form for pregnant women will also serve as the parental 
permission for including the infant as a participant  after delivery.

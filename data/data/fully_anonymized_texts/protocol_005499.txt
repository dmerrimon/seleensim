II. Background  and Significance  
 
A. Historical background  
In the [LOCATION_002], osteoporosis affects over 20 million women and men and 1.5 million Americans 
experience a fragility fracture every year.1 One in fiv e women will experience a hip fracture in their lifetime, a 
devastating consequence that conveys a 24% excess 1-year mortality.2,3 Current osteoporosis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_167636] (BMD) modestly and reduce fracture incidence in high -risk populations, but their 
efficacy is limited, especially in the appendicular skeleton where fracture reductio n does not exceed 50% for 
any agent.4-7 The real world utility of these drugs is further limited by [CONTACT_167657].8-10 
 
Osteoporosis medications can be separated into two categories: (1) antiresorptive medications such as the 
nitrogen -containing bisphosphonates and the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa -B ligand ( RANKL ) 
inhibitor, denosumab, and (2) anabolic agents such as teriparatide (parathyroid hormone (PTH) -1-34) and 
abaloparatide . Over the past decade, several groups have investigated the efficacy of combining anabolic 
agents with bisphosphonates but no combination was shown to increase bone mass more than the individual 
monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].11-[ADDRESS_194954] to results with these anabolic/bisphosphonate combinations, we recently 
reported in the  Denosumab And Teriparatide Administration  (DATA) study that concurrent denosumab and 
teriparatide increased spi[INVESTIGATOR_167637] a greater 
extent than either drug alone.15,[ADDRESS_194955] 
hypothesized that the combination may derive its efficacy from denosumab’s  ability to fully block the pro -
resorptive effects of teriparatide while still allowing for teriparatide to stimulate modeling -based bone formation. 
We now aim to define the mechanisms that form the basis of the se novel clinical observations. In so doing, we 
will build a framework for the design of robust  clinical trials , including fracture prevention outcomes,  with the 
potential to  fundamentally advance osteoporosis treatment.  
 
Effects of teriparatide on bone metabolism and histomorphometry:  Teriparatide, through its binding to the 
PTH/PTHrP receptor stimulates bone remodeling by [CONTACT_167658]  (with intermittent administration favoring bone formation) .17,18 The effects on 
remodeling peak at 3 -12 months, after which rates revert towards baseline.7,11,13,15 Additionally, PTH and its 
analogs influence the activity of other bone cells including osteocytes ( decreasing the expression of the sost 
gene that encode s the osteoblast inhibitor, sclerostin and increasing the expression of RANKL ) and lining cells 
(activating) though the relative physiologic importance of each of these activities is not clear.19,20 In humans, 
teriparatide has been shown to increase BMD at the hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_167638] -

Version:  9.0, August [ADDRESS_194956] bone biopsy specimens from teriparatide -treated 
women, there a re detectable increases in bone formation rates (BFR) and mineralizing surface/bone surface 
(MS/BS) as early as 1 month after the treatment initiation in all four bone compartments (cancellous, 
endocortical, intracortical, and periosteal).21,27,[ADDRESS_194957] also been consistently demonstrated both by [CONTACT_167659] -resolution imaging .9,16,27,29 -32 Notably, the 
relative importance of modeling -based bone formation (MBF) in humans remains controversial.5 In a recently 
reported study by [CONTACT_167660]. , however, it was reported that in women receiving teriparatide for 3 months, 
both modeling and remodeling -based formation (RBF) increased in the cancellous and endocortical 
compartments whereas only MBF increased in the periosteal envelope.[ADDRESS_194958] 
been  attributed to mechanisms both dependent and independent of bone remodeling, including:  
 
1) Stimulating RANKL -mediated bone resorption, leading to the release of osteo -anabolic growth factors 
from the bone matrix.33 
2) Suppressing  expression of the Wnt inhibitor, sclerostin.34 
3) Inhibition of osteoblast apoptosis.35 
4) Activation of quiescent osteoblasts into bone forming osteoblasts.20 
5) PTH induction of Wnt10b by [CONTACT_93247] T lymphocytes.36 
6) Differentiation of bone m arrow stromal cells (BMSCs) into cells of the osteoblast lineage.37 
 
Effects of denosumab on bone metabolism and histomorphometry:  Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that 
inhibits the binding of RANKL  to its receptor on cells of the osteoclastic lineage (RANK).[ADDRESS_194959] consistently demonstrated a decrease in bone resorption (eroded surface ( ES)) as well as BFR 
and MS/BS. Moreover, up to 1/3 of patients treated with denosumab demonstrate an absence of either a 
double or single tetracycline label in trabecular and/or cortical compartments and 50% of patients show a 
complete absence of osteoclas ts in the biopsy specimens.27,39,41,45 More recently, it was reported that in women 
who received denosumab for only 3 -months, all types of bone formation were decreased or unchanged  with 
the exception of modeling -based bone formation in the cancellous envelope, which increased significantly .46  
 
Effects of combination anabolic/antiresorptive therapy on bone metabolism and histomorphometry : While  the 
RANK -ligand mediated mechani sms of bone resorption have  been well studied over the past decade, the 
mechanisms of coupling of this bone resorption to bone formation are less well defined.38,[ADDRESS_194960] of combined anabolic 
+ antiresorptive agents on bone metabolism and histomorphometry.  
 
In the DATA study, the combination of denosumab and teriparatide resulted in less suppression of bone 
formation markers than seen with  denosumab alone whereas bone resorption markers were potently and 
equally suppressed in both the denosumab alone and combination groups. Additionally, combining  teriparatide 
and denosumab suppressed bone resorption markers more completely than ha s been reported in studies of 
combined teriparatide and bisphosphonates.11,13,56 This likely contributes to the relatively greater inc reases in 
BMD with combined denosumab/teriparatide (discussed in detail below).  
 
Quadruple Label Bone Biopsy in Humans :  Paired iliac crest bone biopsies have classically been used to 
assess longitudinal changes in bone histomorphometry.57 Quadruple labeling, however, with 2 pairs of  
tetracycline administrations separated by a period of weeks or months, permits longitudinal assessment with a 
single biops y procedure.58 Specifically, the mineral apposition rate and mineralizing perimeter can be 
measured for the two separate label ing periods, and changes in bone formation rates can thus be calculated at 
2 separate time points. A further advantage of this technique is that each patient is able to serve as her own

Version:  9.0, August 11 , 2021  pre-treatment control, thus reducing variability in histomorphometric parameters and increasing statistical 
power at any given sample size. Indeed, quadruple -labeling has been used successfully to assess the effects 
of teriparatide and other osteoporosis medications in prior studies.27 Moreover, this technique has proven 
especially useful in assessing the exten t of modeling versus remodeling -based bone formation in the different 
bone envelopes,27,58 and thus is a key tool to directly address the fundamental question regarding  combination 
therapy that we are addressing in this proposal.  
 
B. Preliminary Data :  
The rationale and premise for this protocol comes directly from the data reviewed in the 
Background/Significance  section above and the results of the DATA study. In DATA , postmenopausal women 
with osteoporosis were randomized to one of the following 2 -year treatment groups: teriparatide 20 -μg daily 
(n=31), denosumab 60 -mg every 6 months (n=33), or the combination of both medications (n=30). Shown 
below are the 2 -year chang es in BMD in hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] *(P<0.05 vs other groups).  
 
    Lumbar Spi[INVESTIGATOR_167639] a biochemical marker s of bone resorption (serum C -telopeptide, CTX) and bone formation 
(P1NP, osteocalcin) during the first year of treatment, the time during which the advantage of combination 
therapy is observed , are shown below.  
 
 
These results demonstrate that unlike the combination of teriparatide and bisphosphonates, the combination of 
teriparatide and denosumab has additive effects on BMD. The mechanisms underlying these o bservations are 
the focus of this protocol .  
 
Based on the results above, we hypothesize that that denosumab is able to fully block teriparatide’s pro -
resorptive effects (as indicated by [CONTACT_167661]) while permitting ongoing modeling -based bone formation (as indicated by [CONTACT_167662] P1NP  between the denosumab and combined groups).  Confirmation of this 
hypothesis rerquires histomorphometric analysis as proposed in the current studies .

Version:  9.0, August [ADDRESS_194962] the foll owing hypothesis:  
Hypothesis : This study described below will tests the hypothesis that in postmenopausal osteoporotic women, 
combined PTH -receptor stimulation (teriparatide) and RANKL inhibition (denosumab) will result in 
histomorphometrically -demonstrated inhibition of teriparatide -induced skeletal remodeling while allowing for 
continued stimulation of modeling -based bone formation in all bone compartments (cancellous, endocortical, 
intra-cortical, and periosteal).

Source of subjects and recruitment methods  
Recruitment flyers will be posted in approved locations throughout the MGH (including the MGH Bone Mineral 
Density Center) and email announcements will be sent through the Partners Clinical Research Program 
Network.  Letters will be sent to subjects identified through RSVP for Health. Additio nally, a mailing will be sent 
to targeted populations, including subjects who have expressed an interest in one of our research group’s 
previous studies.  
 
Subjects may be recruited from the clinical practice (MGH Endocrine Associates) of the principal inve stigator 
and co -investigator(s). To avoid potential coercion, after the investigator has briefly presented the study, the 
participant  will be asked if they may be re -contact[CONTACT_5365] a more in -depth phone call from another study 
physician. Additionally, infor med consent for screening  will be completed by a research coordinator/study 
physician  and informed consent for the main study will be completed by a study physician who is not a provider 
for each of the patients/subjects of this recruitment method.  
 
NOTE: Entry criteria were established with input from the FDA (Reproductive Section). These criteria are 
similar to those used in our most recent human studies for which we  have been able to meet all enrollment 
goals.  [CONTACT_167691] currently holds IND #[ADDRESS_194967] Enrollment  
This outpatient study will either be conducted at one or more of the following sites:  the General Clinical 
Resear ch Center (GCRC), the Osteoporosis Research Center or the Endocrine Unit Clinical Space (all within 
the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
 
The general design is a randomized, 3 -arm, open label study.  
 
Procedure for informed consent:  
Screening only informed consent will be obtained by a member of the study staff at the Screen visit. Main 
study informed consent will be obtained by a study physician at the beginning of the first study visit.  
 
Subjects will first be screened and those wh o appear eligible will have a medical history and interview with a 
study invest igator at the first study visit and t hose who remain eligible will be randomized.  
 
Groups Assignment and Randomization:  
Those who remain eligible will be formally accepted into the study by a study investigator and assigned to 
one of the 3 interventions by [CONTACT_22123] -generated assignment using a randomly varying blocking scheme 
(block sizes of  3 or 6 ) to minimize the predictability of treatment assignments (1:1:1 ratio) . To account for 
imbalance in the dropout rate as of August 11, 2021, group B will be closed. Subjects will be assigned to one 
of the 2 remaining interventions by [CONTACT_22123] -generated assignment using a randomly varying blocking

There will be 12 subjects in each group.  
 
VI. Study Procedures  
 
Telephone Screening and screening labs:  
Members of research staff will screen all interested subjects over the telephone.  If subjects meet initial criteria 
and are interested in the study, a member of the study staff will schedule a screening visit wherein the subject 
will sign a separate “scre ening only” informed consent form (ICF).  This ICF will allow for a blood draw and 
bone mineral density testing.  
 
Prior to signing this screening only ICF, subjects will be offered the option to speak with a physician 
investigator if they wish or if they h ave questions that can't be answered by [CONTACT_17033]. Research 
assistants will document this conversation on study records.  
 
At this screen visit, bone mineral density of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_167642] s erum or blood:  
• PTH, 25 -OH vitamin D, uric acid, CBC, and comprehensive chemistry panel (serum glucose, BUN, Cr, 
eGFR, Na, K, Cl, Ca, total protein, albumin, bilirubin, ALP, ALT, AST)  
• FSH (if necessary due to prior hysterectomy)  
 
Participants who have serum  uric acid levels > 6.5 mg/dL and are randomized to receive teriparatide will be 
treated with urate lowering therapy prior to receiving teriparatide.  
 
If a subject’s screen eligibility labs contain an abnormal result /s that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], should 
be repeated, the subject will be invited to have the abnormal test/s  repeated with study staff or study staff will 
recommend that the subject have the test /s repeated with the subject’s clinical care team.  
 
If greater than [ADDRESS_194968]’s screen labs and their first main study visit, study 
staff may request the subject to have  all or some of  their screening labs repeated for safety purposes.   
 
If greater than [ADDRESS_194969]’s screening visit and their first main study visit, 
study staff will invite subjects to undergo a re -screen for accuracy and safety purposes.   
 
The study period lasts 3 months.  
 
Visit 1:  
If the subject meets the above BMD and labora tory criteria, she will then be scheduled for Visit #1.  At this visit, 
a study physician will obtain written informed consent for participation in the complete study.  If subjects require 
more time to consider participating after reading the main study IC F the study visit will not continue.  If the 
subject is ready to sign the main study ICF, the study physician will then perform a history and physical on her. 
If all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, subjects will then proceed with the rest of visit 1 and the subsequent 
visits.  
 
Visit 1 -4: 
These visits will occur at the following times:

All subjects who report dietary intake <1200mg of calcium daily will be given supplementation (600mg 
elemental calcium + 400 IU Vitamin D). Total calcium intake (dietary and supplemental) should be at most 
1200mg/day. Subjects with a calcium dietary intake > [ADDRESS_194970] a screen 25 -OH vitamin D level > 50 ng/mL will refrain from vitamin D supplements for the first month and 
then start at 800 units/day.  
 
Note:   Any remaining serum samples will be saved and may be used to measure other variables related to 
bone metabolism at a future time. Samples will be stored with code number and date of sampling in a locked –
80-degree freezer and only approved study personne l will have access to the samples. It is understood that 
any future use of samples must be reviewed and approved separately by [CONTACT_34328] (PHRC) prior to their use.  Personal -Identifying information will be removed before any sam ple is 
sent out for analysis to a non -Partners affiliated institution.

Biochemical markers of bone turnovers of serum procollagen type I N -terminal propeptide  (P1NP), serum 
osteocalcin, and serum β-c-terminal telopeptide of type one collagen (CTX) will be performed on fasting

at the conclusion of the  study. Samples will be stored at -80C.   
 
Iliac crest bone biopsy procedure:  
Iliac crest bone biopsies will be performed at the 3 -month time point, corresponding to the period of 
teriparatide’s maximal stimulation  of osteob lasts and anabolism.[ADDRESS_194972] will supervise anesthesia. 
Before proceeding, the procedure will be discussed with the participant  in detail, including the risks involved 
(see human subjects section).  A model (synthetic pelvic bon e model) will be used to help explain the 
procedure with particular attention to the location of the biopsy.  The use of  short -acting oral 
(lorazepam /alprazolam ) or parenteral sedation  (midazolam and/or fentanyl, in titrated doses) will also be 
discussed with the  participant  and its use is optional depending upon the participant’s  comfort level. The iliac 
biopsy is obtained using a Bordier trephine,  [ADDRESS_194973]. The skin and subcutaneous tissue will be injected with 1% xylocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 
(1:2100,000) anesthetic (it is often necessary to re -dose during the procedure).  The periosteum is then injected 
(both the superficial and the deep surface to prevent pain during biopsy).  After the local anesthetic has been 
allowed to achieve its desired effect, th e incision is made at the pre -marked site.  The superficial surface of the 
ileum is identified and the trephine cutting surface is directly applied to the bone  (the trephine will be marked 
with the desired depth of penetration in order to limit the depth of  penetration into the iliac crest) . The trephine 
is then turned in a clockwise fashion through the superficial cortical surface of bone and the cancellous bone  
(perpendicular with the iliac crest from the outer table to the inner table . The trephine is the n removed and the 
biopsy specimen (core, including cancellous bone and  a single cortical laye r) is placed in 70% ethanol in a 
sterile container labeled with the subject’s unique identifier.  After similar local anesthesia, a second smaller 
core biopsy (3.5 mm x 2 cm) will be obtained from just posterior to the first biopsy . If the participant has 
provided consent, a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_136959] 10 cc  maximum will be obtained from the same site as the

as reported by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Dempster (see figure below, DEM=demeclocycline, TET=tetracycline).58,[ADDRESS_194975] will 
receive 150 mg DEM QID for three days, no label for 12 days and DEM again for three days (3:12:3), ending 2 -
5 days prior to visit 1(baseline labeling). Tetracycline (TET, 250 mg) will be administered in a similar fashion 
prior to visit 3.  The biopsy is performed 5 –[ADDRESS_194976] tetracycline dose.  
 
Core biopsy samples will be fixed immediately in 70% ETOH and high -resolution micro -CT (µCT, µCT40, 
Scanco Medical AG) will be performed in the P30 Core facility to evaluate trabecul ar and cortical bone 
microarchitecture as previously published.32,[ADDRESS_194977] 3D approaches.64 Trabecular bone outcomes will include volumetric density, bone volume fraction, 
thickness, and separation, connectivity density and trabecular bone pattern factor. Cortical outcomes will 
include volumetric density, tissue mineral density, thickness and porosity.  
 
The 8mm core biopsy specimen will then be embedded in methylmethacrylate. Dynamic parameters will be 
evaluated on unstained 10 m sections and static parameters will be evaluated on [ADDRESS_194978] two nonconsecutive sections of each sample 
using Osteomeasure software.  Mineralizing surface/bone surface will be calculated using the length of all 
double labels and the length of half of the single labels. Since demeclocycline can overestimate the length of 
the label relative to tetracycline, the length of the tetracycline labels will be multiplied by a correction factor of 
1.[ADDRESS_194979] remodeling 
characteristics, four compartments will be evaluated: cancellous (bone surround by [CONTACT_167666]), endocortical 
(bone in contact [CONTACT_167667]), intracortical (Haversian canal surface), and 
periosteal (outer boundary of cortex). All parameters will be expressed according to the most recent guidelines 
from the ASBMR.[ADDRESS_194980] surface and eroded surface. In addition, the area occupie d by [CONTACT_167668] 
(adipocyte volume/tissue volume) will be quantitated as will the number of osteoblasts, lining cells and 
osteoclasts (Nob/perimeter, NLc/ perimeter and NOcl/perimeter).  Dynamic parameters  include mineral 
apposition rate, mineralizat ion surface, mineralization lag time, resorption period, resorption rate, and 
activation frequency. Structural parameters  include trabecular bone area, trabecular thickness, trabecular 
number, trabecular separation, cortical width, osteocyte lacunar area a nd cortical porosity. Analyses will be 
performed according to Frost’s method for tetracycline -labeled trabecular bone and the results will be 
interpreted with regard to Frost’s “basic Multicellular unit” (BMU) theory.65,66 One exception to BMU theory will

(modeling -based formation). A bone -forming unit will be identified by [CONTACT_167669]. Remodeling -based formation units (RmF.U) and modeling -based formation units (MF.U) in 
the unlabe led sections will be identified by [CONTACT_167670] -stained sections.   A scalloped reversal line indicates that the forming unit is remodeling -based, 
whereas a smooth cement line indicates that it is modeling -based. Furthermore, we will term a  RmF.U with 
tetracycline label(s) extending beyond the extent of the scalloped reversal line unit as an overfilled remodeling 
unit (oRmF.U).  Collagen fiber alignment will be evaluated under polarized microscopy to  identify interrupted vs. 
uniformly oriented fibers, characteristic of remodeling and modeling -based  formation respectively.  
 
VII. Biostatistical Analysis  
 
This study tests the hypothesis that in postmenopausal osteoporotic women, combined PTH -receptor 
stimulation (teriparatide) and RANKL inhibition (denosumab) will result in inhibition of teriparatide -induced 
skeletal remodeling while allowing for continued vigorous stimulation of modeling -based bone formation.  
 
The primary endpoint of this study is the change  from baseline  to month 3  in the cancellous bone formation 
rate ( BFR/BS) in order to test the hypothesis that modelling based bone formation is occurri ng in the 
combination therapy group .  
 
Key secondary endpoints include MS/BS in the cancellous, endocortical, intracortical, and periosteal 
compartment separately as well as separate calculations of the  proportion of  the rates of remodeling -based  
bone formation  (RBF/BS) , modeling based bone formation (MBF/BS), and overflow MBF (oMBF) in the 
cancellous, endocortical, periosteal compartments .  
 
Between -group differences in endpoints will be assessed by [CONTACT_167671]’ s 3-month mean 
change by [CONTACT_31806] -way ANOVA followed by a post -hoc test.   Normality of the outcome data will be examined by 
[CONTACT_167672][INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk’s test. If the outcomes are not normally distributed, a proper transformation will be performed 
before applying the ANOVA o r the use of the Kruskal -Wallis test followed by [CONTACT_167673]’s non -parametric post -hoc test.  
 
All study participants who have had a bone biopsy at month 3 will be included in the primary outcome analysis. 
For the primary outcome analysis, we will adopt a Bonferroni corrected overall Type -1 error rate of 5% for the 
three -group comparisons (i.e., ind ividual test’s alpha = 0.017). For the secondary outcomes, the Type -1 error 
control for the multiple comparisons will not be considered (i.e., individual test’s alpha = 0.05).   
 
Additional secondary analyses will include an examination of the within -group  mean change of each endpoint 
by [CONTACT_167674] t -test or Wilcoxon’s signed rank test depending on the distribution of the outcome. The 
micro -CT analyses of human bone biopsy specimens are exploratory.  
 
Effect size estimates:  The power analyses were conducted using the estimated standard deviations 
reported in the AVA study (reference 46). This study utilized identical quadruple -labeling biopsy methodology 
in a short -term comparison of 2 different interventions (denosumab versu s teriparatide). We conservatively 
predict that 10 subjects in each group will complete the study (83% completion rate). With this group size, the 
table below  shows our effect size estimates for a 3 -group multiple comparisons at a Bonferroni’s corrected 
overall Type -1 error rate of 5% with 80% power. This detectable difference is much smaller than that reported 
in published studies comparing short term interventions in similar populations, including the AVA study in 
which BFR/BS increased from 0.0096 to 0.0 366 mm3/mm2/y (greater than 3 -fold increase) in women treated 
with teriparatide and decreased from 0.0091 to 0.0014 mm3/mm2/y (greater than 6 -fold decrease) in women 
treated with denosumab. Similar differences were reported in endocortical MS/BS (increase from 9% to 38 
with teriparatide and decrease from 9% to 7% with denosumab, between group difference >30%), 
intracortical MS/BS (increase from 9% to 21% with teriparatide and decrease from 10% to 3% with

Version:  9.0, August 11 , 2021  denosumab, between group difference >19%), and perios teal MS/BS (increase from 1% to 4% with 
teriparatide and decrease from 1% to 0% with denosumab, between group difference >4%). Study 
participants that fall outside the month [ADDRESS_194981] between -group differences in the changes in RBF /BS, MBF /BS, and 
oMBF /BS in cancellous , endocortical, and periosteal bone, we use the standard deviation from a n 
unpublished analysis of the AVA study (Dempster, personal communication). The minimal detectable 
differences shown below are significantly smaller than the reported between group differences in the change 
of each parameter between denosumab and teriparatide treated women in the AVA study. For example , the 
difference between the 3 -month change in cancellous MBF between teriparatide and denosumab treated 
women was 1.5% whereas we will be able to detect a difference of 0.15%. While differences in MBF between 
the combination group and either monotherapy group will likely be lower than t hose observed between 
teriparatide and denosumab, the study will still have sufficient power to detect small between -group 
differences.  Thus, we will have adequate power to test our hypothesis that in postmenopausal osteoporotic 
women, treatment with combi ned teriparatide and denosumab will result in increased  bone formation  
(compared to denosumab alone), and specifically modeling -based bone formation  in all bone compar tments.  
 
The study will not have sufficient power to detect any differences in any safety  endpoints between the three 
groups.

8-8-8 outcomes, the detectable differences for o ur primary endpoint as well as a number of key secondary 
endpoints is much smaller than that reported in published studies comparing short term interventions in similar 
populations, in particular the AVA study (reference 46). While between -group difference s between the 
combination group and either monotherapy group will be smaller than the between -group differences between 
teriparatide and denosumab, the study will have sufficient power to detect small between -group differences.

VIII. Risk and Discomforts  
Risks of these medications are summarized below:  
 
Denosumab  
DMAB is an FDA approved medication used to treat osteoporosis in various populations, including 
postmenopausal women. More than 13,[ADDRESS_194983] been treated with denosumab in clinical studies, and 
it is generally well tolerated.6,43,67 In clinical studies, it has been reported that DMAB may produce the following 
side-effects:  hypersensitivity including anaphylactic reaction, hypocalcemia, osteon ecrosis of the jaw, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_167647], multiple vertebral fractures following denosumab discontinuation, serious infections including 
skin infections and cystitis, dermatitis, rashes, eczema, musculoskeletal pain, and hypercholesterolemia. 
Pancrea titis has been reported in clinical trials.  To reduce the likelihood of adverse events, subjects with any 
contraindications to denosumab, including dental procedures, will be excluded. Subjects will be monitored for 
report of thigh or groin pain and would be evaluated to rule out an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_11280]. Subjects who 
withdraw consent during the study will be counseled on the increased risk of fracture when denosumab is 
discontinued and not followed by [CONTACT_167675] a  referral to a specialist if 
desired.  
 
Teriparatide  
TPTD is an FDA approved medication used to treat postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are at high 
risk of fracture. The most commonly reported side effects of TPTD are overall pain, asthenia, nausea , 
headache, leg cramps, sinus tachycardia, arthralgia, rhinitis, and dizziness. TPTD can cause transient 
hypercalcemia, which is generally mild.7 Repeated daily administration of TPTD in high doses to rodents 
causes dose -dependent osteosclerosis, bony obliteration of the marrow space, and extra -medullary 
hematopoiesis, followed by [CONTACT_167676].68 The relevance of th ese findings to humans is unclear and will 
remain so for many years, because osteosarcoma is rare in adults (4 cases/million/year).[ADDRESS_194984] not reported a linkage 
thus far.  Hypercalcemia is a well -described complication of TPTD treatment.  Elevated blood calcium levels will 
be handled in the manner recommended by [CONTACT_167677].5 (Figure 1)  
 
Antibiotic Labels: Short -term administrations of the tetracycline and demeclocycline  are generally very well 
tolerat ed with the most common side effect being gastrointestinal symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, and 
vomiting. Rarely, maculopapular and erythematous rashes, erythema multiforme and Stevens -Johnson 
syndrome have been reported. Hypersensitivity reactions inclu ding urticaria, angioneurotic edema, 
polyarthralgia, and anaphylaxis have also been rarely reported.  
 
Sedation with Lorazepam/ Alprazolam/ Midazolam/ Fentanyl  (optional) :  
Subjects may opt to have sedation during the bone biopsy procedure. Sedation is generally very safe but there 
is still a risk of side effects. If these side effects do occur, the majority of them are temporary, although long -
term complications may occur. All reasonable precautions will be applied to avoid any complications. Common

Version:  9.0, August [ADDRESS_194985] (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_167648]).   
 
Ondansetron  (optional) : 
If subjects experience nausea or vomiting from the sedation during the bone biopsy procedure, the y will be 
offered ondansetron to help minimize these side effects. Common side effects of ondansetron include 
headache, dizziness, drowsiness, constipation or diarrhea. Additional rare side effects include serious 
arrythmias and hypoxia.   
 
Risks of Bone Biopsy Procedure:  
Bone biopsies of the iliac crest are associated with discomfort but pain can be largely eliminated or reduced 
when the skin and periosteum are adequately treated with local anesthetic prior to the procedure. Serious 
complications are  very rare but include pain, hematoma, and wound infection. Neuropathy (transient) is an 
extremely unusual complication of bone biopsies. In the most comprehensive study of bone biopsy 
complications observed in 9131 trans -iliac biopsies, the incidence of o verall complications was 0.6%; 0.2% 
experienced prolonged pain, 0.2% developed a hematoma, 0.12% experienced transient neuropathy, and 
0.07% developed a wound infection. Two patients (0.02%) experienced hip fracture, and one patient (0.01%) 
developed osteo myelitis. No patient died or experienced permanent disability.70 The short courses of 
tetracycline and demeclocycline ant ibiotics are generally well tolerated but can cause gastrointestinal 
discomfort and sun -sensitivity as discussed above.  
 
Minimizing biopsy risks:  
As stated above, the common risks of the procedure are discussed in detail with the participant . The signs and 
symptoms of infection (fever above 101.5, a draining wound, expanding redness around the incision, 
worsening pain and chills) are described and the subject is instructed to contact [CONTACT_167678].  Post -procedural pain is a risk of the procedure although not technically a complication. 
The subject is instructed that ice be applied to the biopsy site using a cloth barrier between the ice pack and 
the subject’s skin. The subject is also instructed that over t he counter pain medications should also be used to 
help manage pain (acetaminophen and non -steroidal anti -inflammatory medicine). Thigh numbness and pain 
are uncommon complications of this procedure caused by [CONTACT_167679] (LFCN).  The biopsy is taken [ADDRESS_194986] that while some 
bloody staining of the d ressing applied at the end of the procedure is to be expected; bloody drainage from the 
incision should be reported to the investigator immediately. Due to the anesthesia, subjects will be instructed to 
arrange for transportation from the office to their h ome. Subjects will be asked to limit physical activity and hard 
physical work 3 -4 days after the biopsy and not to exercise for 7 days after the biopsy.  
 
All adverse events will be reported to the IRB either immediately (in the case of definitely related or 
probably /possibly  related serious adverse events) or at the time of the scheduled renewal process (for all other  
adverse events).  The study physicians and the study staff will meet on a weekly basis to discuss any issues 
relating to adverse events, saf ety data and outcome data. The risks of bone biopsy will be minimized by [CONTACT_167680] a board -certified orthopedic surgeon.  
 
Imaging studies  
Over the 3 -month study period, subjects will receive only a sing le DXA of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_35632], with consequent 
radiation of <[ADDRESS_194987] been shown to reduce fracture risk in postmenopausal women with

Version:  9.0, August 11 , 2021  osteoporosis when used according to their FDA approved label; however, it is unknown if subjects’ 
osteoporosis will get better, worse, or stay the same  in this study . It is hoped that the knowledge gained from 
this study will improve osteoporosis care. Given the short -term nature of the study, participants will be 
encouraged to discuss continuing osteoporosis care with their providers at the end of the s tudy.  
 
Subjects will be compensated for their time with $25 af ter each visit and $4 00 for completing the bone biopsy , 
for a total of $[ADDRESS_194988] (IRB) will review and approve the study protocol, ICF and any other applicable 
subject  material before any study -specific activities or procedures begin. Before a subject can participate in 
any study -specific activities/procedures, she will sign, or have a legally authorized representative sign and date 
the IRB -approved ICF.  
 
A study physician will review all laboratory test results. The study physicians and the study staff meet on a 
weekly basis to discuss any issues relating to adverse events, safety data and outcome data.  Subjects will be 
discontinued from the study if they have any finding that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_167649]. Disqualifying findings will be communicated to both the subject and her primary care 
physician. If the subject does not have a primary care physician, the princ ipal investigator will coordinate 
appropriate follow -up with a physician of the subject's choosing.  
 
Study Completion and Closeout Procedures  
[CONTACT_167691] and [CONTACT_167692] will verify that:  
- study interventions are complete and that all data have been collect ed 
- correspondence and study files are accessible for audits  
- study records are maintained  
- NIAMS and the IRB are notified of the study’s completion and store a copy of the notifications  
- a clinicaltrials.gov report is completed  
- subjects are notified of study completion and asked if they would like to be informed of the results and/or 
receive a copy of the publication of the trial results  
 
At their third study visit, all study participants will meet with a study physician. The s tudy physician will review 
the experience of the participant during the study and explain to the participant that it is imperative that they 
arrange follow up with their primary care physician within [ADDRESS_194989]’s permission, a letter will be sent to their 
primary care physician , at completion of the study,  including this information and t he results of all relevant 
investigations from the study period. Study participants will be reminded of this information at their final study 
visit and a  follow -up phone call will be made [ADDRESS_194990] (DSMB) will monitor this study. This DSMB is comprised of experienced 
clinical investigators with expertise in osteoporosis: [CONTACT_167693], [CONTACT_167694] , and [CONTACT_167695] .  
 
Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
  Benjamin Z. Leder  - confidential  
 
16 
Version:  9.0, August 11 , 2021  finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the study intervention, which may or  may not be 
related to the intervention. AEs include any new events not present during the pre -intervention period or events 
that were present during the pre -intervention period which increased in severity.  
 
Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A serious ad verse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life -threatening, 
requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], causes persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in congenital 
anomalies/birth defects, or, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_167650], represents other significant hazards or 
potentially serious harm to research participants or others.  
 
Definition of Unanticipated Problems  
Unanticipated problems (UPs) are defined as being unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency 
based on the IRB -approved research protocol, informed consent documents and the participant population 
being studied ; being related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there 
is a reasonable possibility t hat the UP may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); 
AND  suggesting that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or  recognized.  
 
Classification of an Adverse Event  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_167681]:  
 
Mild:  Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
 
Moderate:  Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate 
events may cause some interference with functi oning.  
 
Severe:  Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other 
treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” 
does not necessarily equat e to “serious”.  
 
Relationship to Study Intervention  
All AEs will have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_167682]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about 
causality will be graded using the c ategories below:  
 
Definite:  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors can 
be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time 
relationship to st udy intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_19010]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. 
The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenolo gically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary.  
 
Probable/Possible:  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g. the event occurred within a 
reasonable time after administration of the trial medication), but o ther factors are present which may have 
contributed to the event (e.g. the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). However, there is 
greater than 50% certainty that the event is related to study intervention. The event follows a clinic ally 
reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this 
definition. Although an AE may rate as “probable/possible” upon discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more 
information and later be upgraded t o “definite,” as appropriate.  
 
Unrelated /Unlikely related : The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely  or likely  related to another etiology.  
  Benjamin Z. Leder  - confidential  
 
17 
Version:  9.0, August 11 , 2021   
Expectedness  
The study investigator will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will 
be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk 
information previously described for the study intervention .  
 
Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and 
interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upo n review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate case report form. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s 
assessme nt of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_31278] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be 
documented appropriately regardless of r elationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline 
and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteri orates at any time during the 
study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at 
each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent requir e documentation of onset and 
duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
A Study Team member will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed 
consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of s tudy participation , 
unless reporting is deemed necessary in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_103160] .  At each study visit, the 
investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for 
outcome information un til resolution or stabilization.  
 
Reporting of Adverse Events  
Adverse events and serious adverse events will be reported to all appropriate regulatory bodies as required by 
[CONTACT_167683].  Study staff will record all adverse events in the Adverse Even t Log upon learning of such 
events. The Adverse Event Log will be shared  annually with the IRB at the time of Continuing Review and with 
KAI at the time of the annual meeting. Study staff will also complete a Serious Adverse Event Form for all 
serious adve rse events, to be filed in the subject’s study file.  After identification of any adverse event, the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_167651], enrollment, and ongoing participation and initiatives to prevent 
further AEs if relevant.  The principal i nvestigator  or [CONTACT_167696]  or [CONTACT_167692] will evaluate the adverse event and 
determine whether the adverse event affects the Risk/Benefit ratio of the study and whether modifications to 
the protocol or consent form are required. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_167652], terminated, or modified based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment 
under study.  
 
Reports submitted to [COMPANY_010] will include an annual and final safety report plus any other aggregate analyses 
(of any repor t containing safety data generated during the course of the study) submitted to the Partners IRB.  
 
Adverse Events Requiring Immediate Reporting  
Serious adverse events  
- Study staff will notify KAI of all serious adverse events within 48 hours of learning of such events. KAI will 
notify the NIAMS and the DSMB. This will be followed by a written report as soon as possible.  
- Study staff will not ify the FDA of all serious adverse events within 15 calendar days . The sponsor of the IND 
([CONTACT_167691]) will  adjudicate all adverse events in determining whether reporting to the FDA is necessary. In the

18 
Version:  9.0, August 11 , 2021  case that such an event causes death or is life -threatening, this will be reported to the FDA within 7 calendar 
days. An event is considered life -threatening, a s defined by [CONTACT_1622], if “in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death” (21 CFR 312.32). Non -serious 
adverse events do not require reporting to the FDA.  
- If a serious adverse ev ent is determined to be definitely or probably/possibly related to denosumab, a report 
of the event will also be submitted to [COMPANY_010] at the same time as the IRB report.  
 
Unexpected a dverse event s (serious or non -serious)  that are  definitely related or probably/possibly

Reporting of Unanticipated Problems  
The following procedures will be followed for all Unanticipated Problems (U Ps) that do not meet the definition 
of an adverse event.  
 
Unanticipated problems will be reported within 48 hours to KAI (followed by a written report) and within 7 
calendar days to the IRB. Unanticipated problems that do not meet the definition of an adverse  event will be 
reported to the IRB as an ‘Other Event’ s ubmission on Insight, and must include the following information: a 
detailed description of the unanticipated problem; the basis for determining that the problem is unexpected; the 
basis for determining that the problem indicates that the research places s ubjects at an increased risk of harm; 
and whether any changes to the research or other corrective action are warranted. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_167653], enrollment, and ongoing participation after identification and resolution of thes e 
events.  
 
Further clarification on which events require immediate reporting can be found in the Partners Healthcare 
policy on Reporting Unanticipated Problems including Adverse Events (for reporting to the IRB) and 21 CFR 
312.32 (for reporting to the FDA) . 
 
All subjects will be informed of their rights under the Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act of 
[ADDRESS_194991] data entry will be used (e.g. data entry to be 
performed twice and verified within REDCap). REDCap is designed to comply with HIPAA regulations. Data 
within REDCap will be categorized as verified or unverifie d. Once all verified data are acquired and entered, 
the final dataset will be locked within REDCap. De -identified information sets may be extracted from REDCap 
to be shared with outside collaborators as needed, which would be performed only in accordance w ith the 
Partners IRB approval and the ICF. Collaborators will be provided with de -identified, secure data to be used 
solely for research. Collaborators will be requested to return or destroy data once data analysis is complete.

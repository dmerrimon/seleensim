A5404 
SARS- CoV-2 Immune Responses after COVID -19 Therapy and Subsequent Vaccine  
 
 
DESIGN A5404 is a phase IV, open-label study. The objective of A5404 is  to 
evaluate how prior investigational therapy for COVID-19 versus 
comparator (placebo or active comparator) affects vaccine response.  
 
Eligible A5404 participants include:  
• Cohort 1 (ACTIV -2/A5401 cohort):  Participants of ACTIV -2/A5401 
who received an investigational therapy or its comparator (placebo or 
active comparator ).  
• Cohort 2 ( SARS -CoV-2-naïve cohort) : Persons  without prior history 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection  (non-A5401 participants).  
 
Cohort [ADDRESS_359698] dosing of 
the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, or will receive a community -provided 
mRNA -based COVID -19 vaccine  (e.g., Moderna or [COMPANY_007]) . Cohort [ADDRESS_359699] ACTIV -2/A5401 
investigational therapy, or its comparator. Cohort [ADDRESS_359700] vaccine dose (if feasible), at second dose of 
vaccine (e.g., 28 days later ; if feasible), and at 56 (if feasible), 140, 365, 
and [ADDRESS_359701] vaccine dose. 
 DURATION   730 days.  
 SAMPLE SIZE Cohort 1: 70 participants from  each ACTIV -2/A5401 select therapy group 
(combining recipi[INVESTIGATOR_295160] -2/A5401 on a particular investigational 
therapy , corresponding active comparator , or placebo).  
  And 
 
Cohort 2: Up to 70 participants without prior history of SARS-CoV -2 
infection (SARS -CoV -2-naïve, non-A5401 participants ) per select therapy 
group from ACTIV -2/A5401, based on vaccine supply at each A5404 site. 
For example, up to [ADDRESS_359702] therapy groups are 
evaluated from ACTIV -2/A5401.

FINAL VERSION 3.0  
 SCHEMA (Cont'd) 30Nov2022 
 
 
If up to 70 Phase II participants in the A5401/ACTIV-2 trial from each 
therapy group are not able to be enrolled, then Phase III participants in 
the A5401/ACTIV -[ADDRESS_359703] therapy group can be enrolled 
until full enrollment is achieved. However, Phase II participants are 
preferred.  
 POPULATION  Cohort 1: ACTIV-2/A5401 trial participants who received an 
investigational  therapy or its active comparator/placebo.  
 And  Cohort 2: P ersons without prior history of SARS-CoV -2 infection.  
 
REGIMEN  C
 ohort 1: ACTIV -2/A5401 participants 
Participants will receive one of  the following regimens:  
Cohort 1a: Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine, 100 µg (0.5 mL) to 
be administered intramuscularly (IM) at Entry and Day 28. Both doses 
will be provided by [CONTACT_1758].  
Or 
 
Cohort 1b: Participants will receive a two-dose series of a 
community-provided mRNA -based COVID -19 vaccine that has received 
FDA EUA or FDA approval (e.g., Moderna or [COMPANY_007]) . Vaccine will not be 
provided by [CONTACT_1758].  NOTE: These participants may enter the study before their first vaccine dose, after their first vaccine dose, or after their second vaccine dose.   
Or 
 
Cohort 1c: Participants will receive their first Moderna mRNA -1273 
COVID -19 vaccine dose in the community. Their second Moderna 
mRNA-1273 dose will be provided by [CONTACT_1758] ( 100 µg [0.5 mL] to be 
administered IM [ADDRESS_359704] dose).  
 NOTE: These participants may enter the study before or after their first vaccine dose.   
Cohort 2: P
 articipants without prior history of SARS -CoV-2 infection  
Participants will receive the following study-provided regimen:  
Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID-19 vaccine, 100 µg (0.5 mL) to be 
administered IM at Entry and Day 28.

 1.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
 
1.1 Primary Objective  
 
1.1.1 To estimate the difference in neutralizing antibody (NA b) response to mRNA -
based COVID -19 vaccine among participants with prior  SARS-CoV-2 infection 
who received i nvestigational therapy  exposure compared to participants  without 
prior investigational therapy  exposure (placebo for investigational therapy or 
active comparator ). 
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
To explore the safety of mRNA -based COVID -19 vaccine s among participants  with prior 
COVID -19 who received investigational therapy or its comparator for COVID -19 and 
persons who are SARS-CoV -2 naïve. 
 
1.3 Other Objectives  
 1.3.1 To explore the difference in humoral and cellular immune responses to 
mRNA-based COVID -19 vaccines among participants with prior COVID-19 
who received investigational therapy compared to participants without 
prior investigational therapy (placebo or corresponding active comparator) exposure and persons who are SARS -CoV-2 naïve. 
 1.3.2 To explore the difference in humoral and cellular immune responses, 
including NAb levels, B and T cell responses, and serologic responses to COVID -19 vaccination by [CONTACT_295180]/placebo exposure and 
compared to persons who are SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_359705] dose of vaccine is administered.

2.2 Rationale 
 
Immune R e sponses  
Early in the pandemic, it was unknown if natural infection with SARS -CoV-2 induced adaptive 
immune responses. Research by [CONTACT_295182] -
specific antibodies and T cell responses  [9]. Further investigations found that multiple SARS-
CoV-2 antigens were recognized by [CONTACT_398]4+ and CD8+ T cells in these individuals  [9]. The 
frequencies of viral antigen-specific T cells corresponded to predicted viral protein 
abundance in infected cells  [9]. Analyses in persons followed from acute COVID -19 found 
that a coordinated adaptive immune response consisting of SARS -CoV -2-specific CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells and NAb was associated with less severe disease [ 10]. This study also defined 
how most people with COVID -19 had measurable antibody (IgG, IgA, IgM) to the viral Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] 
(S) prote in, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S, and Nucleocapsid (N) protein, as well as 
neutralizing antibody ( NAb). Similarly, most participants also had SARS- CoV-2-specific CD4+ 
T cells, CD8+ T cells, and T follicular helper cells to viral S, matrix (M), N,  and other viral 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. Interestingly, correlation analyses demonstrated that viral -specific T cell responses, 
but not NAbs, were associated with COVID-19 severity  [10]. Further studies found that most 
participants had durable adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV -2, although heterogeneity was 
observed in the adaptive immune responses including half-lives of SARS -CoV-2 specific 
antibody titers and memory B and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses [ 11]. The same assays 
used in these studies and others will be used in this study [9- 15]. This A5404 study will also 
evaluate persons  without prior SARS-CoV -2 infection as a comparison group (i.e., SARS -
CoV-2 naïve group) to evaluate vaccine-induced immune responses . Although persons ≥18 
years old may enroll into the SARS- CoV-2 naïve group, t he age eligibility for PBMC collection 
is limited to those persons ≥[ADDRESS_359714] immune responses, and less likely  to match the ages of participants in ACTIV-2/A5401. Including this SARS -CoV -
[ADDRESS_359715] be delivered within a short timeframe after opening a multidose vial (see section 5.2.1  and M
anual of Procedures [MOPS ] for further description).  
 
We imagine a number of people will be enrolled in the SARS -CoV-2 naïve group with 
prior asymptomatic SARS-CoV -2 infection. These people will still be able to obtain an  
mRNA COVID -19 vaccine, as they would in the community, so they will not be pre-
screened for our study. The A5404 study will assess baseline serology in the context of 
the trial to determine if such participants are evaluable for the sub-analyses of the 
SARS- CoV-2 naïve group, but these analyses will be conducted after the participant has 
enrolled in the trial and received their vaccination.  The team recognizes the value in studying all COVID -19 vaccine types, but increasing 
the types of COVID -19 vaccines in A5404 will decrease the overall number of 
participants receiving the same type of vaccine. This heterogeneity could be an issue as 
there seems to be different NAb dynamics between mRNA versus adenoviral vaccines and therefore analyses would be carried out separately. Smaller sample sizes  may lead 
to a decrease in precision on the estimated neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels post-
vaccine. Since we will be providing the Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine, we wil l 
only evaluate mRNA vaccines.

Reinfection  
As described above, initial SARS -CoV -2 infection elicits human immune responses, and 
it is likely that these responses offer some level of protection from reinfection for some 
time. NAb seems to be an important immune correlate of protection and subsequent 
disease severity [16-18] . It is unclear how these reinfections impact vaccine 
development and long-term efficacy  [19]. However, people who have had SARS -CoV-2 
infection can subsequently be reinfected [20], and perhaps active viral infection 
generates a weaker immune response than what can be elicited by a COVID -19 vaccine 
[21]. Due to the lack of close molecular epi[INVESTIGATOR_295166], it remains unclear 
how frequently reinfection occurs  [22]. Open questions that remain concerning initial 
infection include identifying exact correlates of immune protection, length of protection 
generated after initial SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_359716] 
COVID -19 infection has not been fully discerned nor is it known if predictors of immune 
responses to vaccination, such as baseline inflammation, are associated with immune responses to COVID -19 mRNA vaccination [23]. 
 
Currently, the CDC recommends that people with prior COVID-[ADDRESS_359717] that the risk of 
reinfection is low following initial infection [ 24]. It is noted, however, that the risk of 
reinfection may increase over time due to waning immunity  [24]. The optimal timing of a 
vaccination to boost such waning immunity is unknown and is the rationale for the [ADDRESS_359718] dose of ACTIV -2/A5401 select therapy (i.e., 
post-infection) for vaccination in the proposed study. Understanding how SARS -CoV-2 
immune responses develop and then wane after vaccination may be important for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_295167]-vaccination. 
 
Study Overview  
We will recruit ACTIV -2/A5401 participants  (Cohort 1 ) and persons without prior history 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection  (Cohort 2) into the A5404 study. We will enrol l participants 
who elect to receive mRNA vaccines outside of A5404 to maximize the number of ACTIV -[ADDRESS_359719] dosing of Moderna COVID -19 vaccine  [21] or will obtain mRNA -
based COVID -19 vaccination in the community outside of the study . Cohort 2 
participants will only be enrolled at sites enrolling Cohort 1 participants. People who participate in the study will be followed longitudinally for humoral and cellular immune dynamics.   
Closed to Accrual 
Accrual closed on February 25, 2022, due to slow enrollment and difficulty 
enrolling new  participants into the various study cohorts. Vaccine responses will 
be studied in the 43 participants who enrolled.

3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
A5404 is a phase IV, open-label study. Eligible participants include: 
• Cohort 1:  Participants of ACTIV -2/A5401 who received selected investigational 
therapy or its comparator  (active or placebo). 
• Cohort 2:  Persons without a prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (non -A5401 
participants)  who have not yet received a COVID -19 vaccine. 
 
The objective of the study is  to evaluate whether prior investigational therapy versus 
placebo or active comparator in ACTIV-2/A5401 affects vaccine response. Cohort 1 
participants will be offered the Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine (Cohorts 1a 
[full series to be administered through study] and 1c [first dose received in the 
community, second dose to be administered through the study] ) or receive an 
mRNA -based COVID -19 vaccine in the community  (Cohort 1b [both doses received in 
the community] or Cohort 1c [first dose received in the community, second dose in the study] ), with the first vaccine dose administered 30-[ADDRESS_359720] dose of ACTIV -2/A5401 select therapy (investigational agent or active 
comparator or placebo). Commu nity-provided mRNA -based COVID-[ADDRESS_359721] vaccine dose  (if 
feasible), and before the second dose of vaccine (e.g., 28 days later  for Moderna 
vaccine and 21 days later for [COMPANY_007] -BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA COVID -19 vaccine if 
given in the c ommunity ) (if feasible), and 56 (if feasible), 140, 365, and [ADDRESS_359722] vaccine dose (Figure 3.0-1).  
 
 
Figure 3.0-1:  This schema includes common assessments for ACTIV -2/A5401 
participants in both phases 2 and 3 (panel A). If possible, b lood will be collected before 

 [ADDRESS_359723] 
vaccine dose (panel B). If possible, p articipants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 7 days after each 
vaccine dose to grade vaccine-associated symptoms. 
 
Up to 70 participants from  Cohort 1 will be enrolled from  each ACTIV -2/A5401 select 
therapy group along with 350 participants from  Cohort 2 without prior SARS- CoV-2 
infection (i.e., SARS-CoV-2-naïve, non-ACTIV -2/A5401 participants). The total sample 
size will depend on how many select therapy groups are evaluated in ACTIV -2/A5401.  
 If a sufficient number of  Phase II participants in the A5401/ACTIV-[ADDRESS_359724] 
therapy group are not able to be enrolled, then Phase III participants in the 
A5401/ACTIV-[ADDRESS_359725] therapy group can be enrolled until full enrollment is 
achieved. However, Phase II participants are preferred. 
 
As available, PBMC from days 0, 7, 28, and week 24 from Cohort 1 participants will be 
used for this study. Plasma from each of the time points that blood for PBMC is collected 
will also be used for this study. Samples will be used to study the adaptive immune response to SARS -CoV-2 during acute and convalescent COVID -19 in the context of 
treatment versus active comparator/placebo receipt during acute COVID -19. This will 
also connect to the vaccination arm of the ACTIV -2/3 studies, as feasible.  
 The study will provide important information on the use of mRNA -based COVID -19 
vaccine s for persons after SARS- CoV-2 infection and for persons who received 
investigational  therapy , including monoclonal antibodies, for  COVID -19. Study outcome 
measures are provided in section 10.2 in line with the Study Objectives .

 6.2 Timing of Evaluations  
 
6.2.1 Screening Evaluations  
 
If the participant is in Cohorts 1a or 1c or Cohort 2  (receiving study -provided 
Moderna COVID-19 vaccine), then s creening evaluations must occur prior to the 
participant receiving first dose of study vaccine.  
  
If the participant is in Cohorts 1b or 1c (receiving community-provided 
mRNA COVID-19 vaccine),  it is preferred for these participants to have their 
screening evaluations  before their first or second community-provided vaccine 
dose, if feasible.  
  
For all participants, s creening evaluations to determine eligibility must be 
completed within [ADDRESS_359778] occur ≤ [ADDRESS_359779] dose of an investigational therapy or 
corresponding active comparator/placebo in ACTIV -2/A5401.  
 
Entry Evaluations for Cohort 1a and C
 ohort 2 Participants (both vaccine 
doses provided by [CONTACT_1758])  
Entry evaluations may be performed up to [ADDRESS_359780] be available before the study -provided vaccine dose is administered for

 7.[ADDRESS_359815] and safety of the study via regular summaries of accrual, study discontinuation, stored sample and data completeness, and AEs as 
described in the Study Progress, Data, and Safety Monitoring Plan (SPDSMP). These 
reports will be summarized among participants with no prior history of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_359816] as per DAIDS policies, guidance documents, and SOPs as applicable. Additionally, the DAIDS clinical  
representative will  routinely review aggregated AE summaries pooled across the 
blinded ACTIV-2/A5401 arm s prepared by  [CONTACT_295188] 
(SDAC) on a schedule as defined in the SPDSMP. 
 The study will undergo interim safety review s by [CONTACT_163411] -appointed Study Monitoring 
Committee (SMC)  at least annually. The first interim review will occur  when [ADDRESS_359817] dose 
of vaccine after study entry, and their data through study Day 7 ([ADDRESS_359818]

8.0 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
8.1 Toxicity  
 
Only toxicities related to study medication provided through this study will be consider
ed in the toxicity management section. Participants who receive 
community-provided COVID -19 vaccine should manage toxicity for that medication 
per SOC. The grading system for vaccine toxicities is located in the DAIDS AE Grading Table, corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, which can be found on the DAIDS RSC website at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research-sites/daids -adverse-event-grading-tables . 
 
 [ADDRESS_359820] their health care provider or seek urgent or emergent care, or 911 should be 
called, as appropriate.  
 
Vaccine may be discontinued without contact[CONTACT_295189], but the protocol team should be notified within 48 hours of vaccine discontinuation or interruption (follow the directions described in the Study Management section ). 
 8.2 Pregnancy   
 
There is limited  data regarding the use of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine s in participants who 
are pregnant. T he American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) suggests  
offering vaccination to pregnant and breastfeeding individuals if  they meet the criteria for 
vaccination based on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommending priority groups for vaccination [ 25, 26]. T he Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention ( CDC) has recently classified pregnant and breastfeeding individuals at 
increased risk of severe illness or death from COVID -19 [27]. Therefore, pregnant 
individuals are eligible to participate in this study.  
 
Participants who become pregnant after the first dose of the vaccine but prior to the second dose are eligible to receive the second dose of the vaccine. If pregnant participants choose 
not to receive the second dose of the vaccine, they will be encouraged to continue on study and complete the evaluations indicated in the Schedule of Evaluations. At the end of the 
pregnancy, outcome and adverse events for participant and infant will be recorded on the 
outcome eCRF. 
 If a participant has completed the study or chooses to discontinue from the study before 
the end of the pregnancy, then site staff should request permission to contact [CONTACT_295190]. If the information is obtained, 
pregnancy outcomes will be submitted on an e CRF at the end of the pregnancy.  
 
8.3 Breastfeeding 
 
There are no data regarding the use of mRNA COVID -19 vaccines in participants who 
are breastfeeding. See section 8.2 for further rationale to allow individuals who are 
breastfeeding to participate in this study .

8.4 Allergic Reactions  
 
All participants should be monitored closely, as there is a risk of systemic reaction 
(including anaphylaxis) with any vaccine.  
 Symptoms and signs that may occur as part of an administration reaction include, but 
are not limited to, fever, chills, nausea, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, 
angioedema, throat irritation, rash including urticaria, pruritus, myalgia, and dizziness.  
The severity of systemic reactions will be assessed and reported using the criteria for i
nfusion-related reactions in the DAIDS AE Grading Table, corrected Version 2.1, July 
2017, which can be found on the DAIDS RSC website at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -
research-sites/daids -adverse-event- grading-tables . 
 
The clinical site should have necessary equipment and medications for the management 
of any administration reaction, which may include, but is not limited to, oxygen, IV fluid, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], acetaminophen, and antihistamine.  
 Investigators should determine the severity of the reaction and manage reactions based on standard of care and their clinical judgment. If an administration reaction occurs, then 
supportive care should be provided in accordance with the signs and symptoms.  
 
8.5 Injection Site Reactions  
 
Injection-site reactions (ISRs) will be differentiated from the above generalized allergic 
r
eactions by [CONTACT_295191]/tenderness, induration, erythema, and/or 
formation of an ulceration or infection at the injection site. ISRs will be graded per the 
DAIDS AE Grading Table, corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, which can be found on the 
DAIDS RSC website at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research-sites/daids -adverse-

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
10.1 General Design Issues  
 
The aim of this study is to describe immunologic responses to mRNA -based SARS- CoV-
2 vaccine among individuals who previously received investigational therapy in ACTIV -
2/A5401 for SARS -CoV-2 infection in comparison to individuals who received a placebo. 
As ACTIV -2/A5401 is expected to change from using a placebo control to an active 
control, this study’s aim will also evolve to describe immunologic responses to mRNA -
based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among individuals who previously received investigational therapy in ACTIV -2/A5401 for SARS -CoV -2 infection in comparison to individuals who 
received an active control . Results will need to be interpreted in the context of available 
information from outside the study when analyses are completed. 
 
ACTIV -2/A5401 is evaluating multiple investigational agents with randomized 
comparison of a given investigational agent to a placebo control group which includes 
participants who were eligible to receive that investigational agent but who were concurrently randomized to receive the placebo for that specific agent or a placebo to another agent being evaluated at the same time. This combined placebo control group (or its equivalent combined active control group when ACTIV -2/A5401 changes to use 
an active control group) will be used in comparisons in this study. The randomization system in ACTIV -2/A5401 is designed so that the number of participants in the 
combined placebo group for evaluating a given investigational agent is approximately the same as the number of participants  who received that investigational agent. Based 
on the select investigational agents likely to be included in this study, it is antic ipated that 
the ratio of these numbers in this study will be close to 1:1. However, even if this is not achieved, the combined placebo group used in this study will still include participants who were eligible to receive the investigational agent and who were concurrently randomized to receive a placebo.  
 Although participants in this study were randomized to receive select therapy or 
corresponding active comparator/placebo in the ACTIV -2/A5401 study, the exposure 
comparison in this study is not a pure randomized comparison. Outcomes experienced 
in the ACTIV -2/A5401 study, including differential experiences by [CONTACT_295193]/placebo, may influence a participant’s decision to enroll in this study (even though participants will still be blinded to their select 
therapy group assignment in ACTIV -2/A5401). Differences in mortality between the 
investigational therapy and active comparator/placebo exposures may also lead to 
differences in enrollment to this study. With the caveat of limited sample size, adjusted analyses and or analyses using propensity scores or other approaches for causal inference may be used to explore potential biases in exposure comparisons induced by 
[CONTACT_295194]. 
 
Note that for the purposes of statistical analysis of this study, unblinded statisticians will have access to the treatment assignments from ACTIV-2/A5401 but the participants and other investigators in the study will not be unblinded.

10.2 Outcome Measures  
 
Primary and secondary outcome measures listed below will be addressed in the study’s 
pr
imary Statistical Analysis Plan, which will define the content of the Primary Analysis 
Report. This report will form the basis for the primary study manuscript and results reporting to https://ClinicalTrials.gov. Outcome measures will be analyz ed as 
originally pre -specified if accrual is sufficiently high to provide meaningful 
estimates. Otherwise, analyses will instead be reported as descriptive estimates within participant groups rather than as comparisons between groups. Additional 
details are pre -specified in the primary Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
10.2.1 
 Primary Outcome Measure  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Neutralizing antibody (NAb) level at least [ADDRESS_359825] dose 
of the study - or community -provided vaccine.  
 
10.2.2 Secondary Outcome Measures  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Relative pre -vaccine to post-vaccine change in NAb response 
defined as the ratio of post-vaccine level/pre-vaccine level. The pre-vaccine NAb measurement will be obtained before the first dose of 
the vaccine, and the post-vaccine measurement will be obtained at least [ADDRESS_359826] dose of the vaccine.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] New Grade [ADDRESS_359827] dose of 
vaccine.

FINAL VERSION 3.0  
  30Nov2022 
 
10.2.3 Other  Outcome Measures  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to SARS -CoV-2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_295170] -CoV -2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_295171] (RBD) and N terminal domain (NTD) at study 
entry/Day [ADDRESS_359831] vaccine dose.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Flow cytometry of PBMC for markers of exhaustion on B and T cells at study entry/Day 0, 56,  and [ADDRESS_359832] the pooled 
placebo group or active comparator. 
 
To inform sample size and precision of estimates, we use data from a recent study of 
outpatients with symptomatic COVID -19 followed longitudinally [8] to provide information 
about variability in NAb levels and changes in NAb levels (in the absence of both Ab therapy  and vaccine). These data include samples taken up to 180 days after symptom 
onset. NAb levels in that study were measured using the pseudotyped virus reported 
from a single-round-of-infection neutralization assay (PsVNA or PSV), the same assay as will be used in this study. The standard deviation of log NAb levels was 0.[ADDRESS_359833]-v accine NAb measurement in this study). The extended time interval up to 240 
days in this study might result in reduced variability (lower standard deviation) and thus the estimate of 0.[ADDRESS_359834] vaccine dose , 
we will calculate the ratio of geometric mean responses (GMRs) for participants with 
prior select investigational  therapy exposure versus participants who received placebo. 
A rati o of GMRs (GMR for investigational therapy exposed divided by [CONTACT_295196]) 
of one indicates no difference in NAb response. A ratio of less than [ADDRESS_359835] investigational  therapy exposure 
compar ed to those who received placebo. The main analysis is descriptive: to provide an 
 55 A5404 
FINAL VERSION 3.0  
  30Nov2022 
 
estimate of the ratio of GMRs and associated confidence interval. If the study does not 
enroll enough participants to provide meaningful estimates and/or precision, then NAb levels at [ADDRESS_359836] vaccine dose will be reported as separate 
descriptive results among participants exposed to ACTIV -2/A5401 active 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], participants exposed to ACTIV-2/A5401 placebo, and participants exposed to ACTIV -2/A5401 active comparator.  
 
The statistical analysis will be undertaken on a log (base 10) scale as is conventional for NAb measurements (as the distribution of log responses is generally closer to a normal 
distribution).  The estimate and confidence interval will be anti -logged to provide an 
estimate and confidence interval for the ratio of GMRs. For the purposes of evaluation of 
precision and sample size, we assume that the confidence intervals can be calculated using standard methods assuming that responses are approximately normally distributed on a log scale.  
 
Table 10.4-1 shows the anticipated precision in this study of estimates of the ratio of 
GMRs (after anti -logging) for participants with versus without prior exposure to 
investigational agents  and assuming that the observed ratio of GMRs is one (i.e., under 
the null hypothesis of no difference between groups), for a range of standard deviations encompassing the value of 0.5. For a standard deviation of 0.5 and a sample size of 70 
participants who receive vaccine ( 35 with prior investigational therapy and 35 who 
received active comparator/placebo [a 1:1 ratio]), the 90% confidence interval for the 
ratio of GMRs is ( 0.63, 1.58) and the 95% confidence interval is ( 0.58, 1.73). These 
confidence intervals suggest reasonable precision to rule out reductions in response associated with prior investigational therapy of about 40% or more or increases of about 
60% or more. If there are investigational agents included in ACTIV -2/A5401 but not in 
this study, it is possible that the ratio of number of participants with prior exposure to a 
given agent to the number of participants in the combined placebo group will differ from 1:1. Table 10.4-1  s
hows confidence intervals for various ratios of participants in this 
study with prior investigational therapy versus placebo. There is some loss of precision (wider confidence intervals) as the ratio increases from 1:1 to 4:1 for fixed sample size 
but the precision is still reasonable (note 4:[ADDRESS_359837] investigational agents likely to be included in this study). There is also some loss 
of precision for standard deviations larger than 0.[ADDRESS_359838] lower than anticipated observed enrollment numbers. With a total sample size less than 30, expected precision on the GMR ratio is low , and 
therefore if total enrollment numbers do not exceed this level, descriptive analyses may be preferred.

Table 10.4-1: Confidence Intervals for an Observed Ratio of GMRs C omparing Participants 
With Versus Without Prior I nvestigational Therapy  for a R ange of Sample Sizes 
and Standard Deviati ons (SDs: for log base 10 values)  
A key secondary outcome measure evaluates relative change in NAb level pre-vaccine 
to post-vaccine. The statistical analysis for this outcome measure will use change in log 
(base 10) NAb level pre -vaccine to post-vaccine. The outpatient study provides 
information about the variability in change in log NAb level over time. Forty -three of the 
participants in that study had an additional measurement earlier in follow -up. The 
median time of the first measurement was 63 days after onset of symptoms and the median time of the second measurement was 159 days after onset of symptoms. The median duration of time between measurements was 96 days (similar to the time interval between the pre-vaccine and post-vaccine measurements in this study). The standard deviation of changes in log NAb level among these 43 participants was 0.35. Assuming 
that the variability of changes in this study is similar (standard deviation of 0.4 and 
recognizing that the vaccine should alter the mean change), then Table 10.4-1  s
hows 
that with a sample size of 70 participants receiving vaccine with equal numbers with 
versus without prior investigational therapy, the 90% confidence interval is ( 0.69, 1.44 ) 
and the 95% confidence interval is ( 0.64, 1.55) when the observed ratio of GMRs 
comparing participants with versus without prior select therapy is 1. Similar 
considerations as noted above for the primary outcome measure apply if the ratio of Allocation

 Analyses  
 
Statistical analysis plans will be developed describing analyses to address the primary and secondary objective of the study.  
 
The primary outcome analysis is descriptive and was originally intended to be carried 
out separately for each investigational therapy and associated combined placebo group 
or investigational agent and associated active comparator  group. Due to lower than 
anticipated enrollment into the study, the primary outcome analysis may be amended to be carried out in a combined group of participants exposed to particular ACTIV -2/A5401 investigational agents. Additional details are described 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan. The analysis will combine participants regardless of 
which mRNA -based COVID-19 vaccine they received. An exploratory  analysis may be 
carried out separately for each mRNA -based COVID-19 vaccine if sample size 
permits.  The following description focuses on the comparison of outcomes among participants who received an  investigational agent in ACTIV -2/A5401 compared with participants in 
the combined placebo control group. Similar analyses will be undertaken if the 
comparison is to parti cipants in an active control group. 
 For the primary outcome measure, we will evaluate the ratio of GMRs for participants 
with prior investigational therapy versus participants who received placebo. A ratio of GMRs (GMR for investigational therapy exposed divided by [CONTACT_295196]) of one 
indicates no difference in NAb response. A ratio less than 1 indicates lower NAb 
response among those who received prior investigational therapy exposure compared to those who received placebo. If the study does not enroll enough participants to provide meaningful estimates and/or precision, then NAb levels at [ADDRESS_359840] vaccine dose will be reported as separate descriptive results among participants exposed to ACTIV-2/A5401 active therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], participants exposed to 
ACTIV -2/A5401 placebo, and participants exposed to ACTIV -2/A5401 active 
comparator. 
 
The primary analysis population will include all participants who received at least one 
vaccine dose and provided NAb responses  at least [ADDRESS_359841] 
vaccine dose will be excluded from the primary analysis. The primary analysis is 
descriptive: to provide estimates  of NAb and if sample size allows, the ratio of GMRs 
and associated confidence interval. No formal statistical tests will be performed. 
Estimates and confidence intervals will be obtained from linear regression with an indicator variable for prior investigational therapy exposure versus placebo using standard methods assuming that NAb responses are approximately normally distributed 
on a log (base 10) scale. To allow for the possibility that the distribution of time from 
receipt of investigational therapy or placebo to the first dose of vac cine may  vary , an 
analysis adjusted for this time will also be undertaken. A  supplemental  analysis will be 
conducted among participants who received both doses of the vaccine. An exploratory 
analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_46317] -based COVID -[ADDRESS_359842] vaccine dose will be excluded. The analysis is descriptive: To provide estimates of change in NAb and if sample size allows, the ratio of GMRs and associated confidence interval. No formal statistical tests 
will be performed. Estimates and confidence intervals will be obtained from linear 
regression with an indicator variable for prior investigational therapy exposure versus 
placebo using standard methods assuming that NAb responses are approximately normally distributed on a log (base 10) scale. To allow for the possibility that the distribution of time from receipt of investigational therapy or placebo to the first dose of vaccine may vary, an analysis adjusted for this time may also be undertaken. A 
sensitivity analysis will be conducted among participants who received both doses of the 
vaccine. An exploratory analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_46317] -based COVID -[ADDRESS_359843] 
as for participants with prior COVID -19 and is intended to be descriptive. In the event 
that there are differences in outcomes between participants with prior COVID -19 
(including taking account of exposure to ACTIV -2/A5401 investigational agent, placebo, 
or active control) and participants without prior COVID -19, which are considered large, 
exploratory analyses may be undertaken taking account of information available at the 
time of analysis about participant char acteristics that might affect the magnitude of 
vaccine response.  
 
The safety analysis population will include all participants who receive at least the first 
vaccine dose. The analysis of safety outcome measures will be descriptive by [CONTACT_295197]/p lacebo in 
ACTIV -2/A5401, and separately for participants without prior COVID -19. We will

95% confidence interval) at the pre-specified time points detailed in section 10.2.2 . 
 
Outcomes experienced in the ACTIV -2/A5401 study, including differential experiences 
by [CONTACT_295198] /placebo, may influence a 
participant’s decision to enroll in this study even though participants will still be blinded to their assignment in ACTIV -2/A5401. If sample size permits, adjusted analyses or

This form is for use in a research study that may involve participants who may or may not have 
the capacity to consent to take part in the study. When the participant cannot legally consent to take part, pronouns “you” and “your” should be read as referring to the participant rather than the person (legally authorized representative) who is signing and dating this form for the participant. In cases where the participant’s representative gives consent, the participant should 
be informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. During the 
course of the study, if the participant regains the capacity to consent, informed consent will be obtained from the participant, and the participant offered the ability to leave the study if desired.  
 
SUMMARY  
 
PURPOSE  Thi
 s is a research study and your participation in this study is voluntary. 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mRNA 
COVID -19 vaccine s in: 
• P eople with prior COVID -19 (SARS- CoV-2 infection) who were in the 
ACTIV -2/A5401 study.  
And  
• People who have never had COVID -19 (SARS- CoV-2 infection). 
 
VACCINE  S tudy-provided Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine , or  
 Community -provided mRNA COVID -19 vaccine (from a local clinic or 
vaccination site, for example) . 
 
NUMBER OF  
PARTICIPANTS  This study planned to enroll 70 people who were in ACTIV -2/A5401 from 
each ACTIV -2/A5401 study treatment group, and up to [ADDRESS_359854] never had COVID -19 per each ACTIV -2/A5401 study treatment  
group. E nrollment into this study closed on February 25, 2022, due to 
slow enrollment. A total of 43 participants were enrolled. 
 
LENGTH OF  
STUDY   You will be on this study for up to 730 days , which is about 2 years .

 REQUIRED  
ACTIVITIES  If you enter the study before you have the first vaccination, you will have 
blood drawn from a vein in your arm  before your first and second mRNA 
COVID -[ADDRESS_359855] blood drawn on the day you 
enroll in the study. This blood will be used to measure immune and genetic (determined by [CONTACT_295202]) responses to your initial SARS -
CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID -19) infection and to the mRNA 
COVID -[ADDRESS_359856] been reported with the Moderna mRNA -1273 
COVID -19 vaccine include: 
• Injection site reactions: pain, itching, tenderness and swelling of the 
lymph nodes in the same arm of the injection, swelling and hardness 
around the injected area, and redness . 
• General side effects: fatigue (tiredness), headache, muscle pain, joint 
pain, chills, nausea and vomiting, fever, and mild abdominal pain. 
• Other: facial flushing (redness), generalized itching, tingling of face or 
extremities, runny nose, sneezing, hypotension (low blood pressure), hives, and pruritus (itch ing).

 • There is increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis is inflammation of the lining outside the heart. 
 There is a very small chance that the study -provided Moderna mRNA-
1273 COVID-19 vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe 
allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after being vaccinated. For this reason, you will be asked to stay at the 
study site for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic 
reaction can include:  
• Difficulty breathing or swallowing  
• Chest tightness  
• Shortness of breath 
• Coughing 
• Wheezing  
• Swelling of your face and throat 
• A fast heartbeat 
• A bad rash all over your body  
• Vomiting 
• Abdominal pain 
• Dizziness and weakness  
• Fainting (loss of consciousness) , convulsions (like a seizure) 
 
If You are Receiving Community -
 Provided mRNA COVID -[ADDRESS_359857] future 
COVID -19 (SARS- CoV-2 infection), whether you have been infected 
previously or not. 
 
OTHER CHOICES   Ins tead of being in this study, you have  the choice  of obtaining a COVID -
19 vaccine in the community, obtaining an experimental  COVID -19 
vaccine in another study, if you qualify, or no vaccination.  
 
 I
NTRODUCTION  
 You are being asked to take part in this research study because you:  
 
1. H ave previously had COVID-19 (SARS-CoV -2 infection) and received an experimental 
treatment, placebo (a look -alike product that has no activ e substance), or a standard of care 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases / Pr otocol Number A5404 / FINAL VERSION 3.0   Page 4 of  20 
 
«Pi[INVESTIGATOR_154549] » Advarra IRB Approved Version 30 Nov 2022  Revised «PI[INVESTIGATOR_154550] » 
 COVID -19 treatment (the usual care for COVID -19 at the time)  in a clinical trial known as 
ACTIV -2/A5401. 
 
Or 
 
2.  You have not previously been diagnosed with a COVID -19 (SARS- CoV-2 infection ) infection 
and have not previously been vaccinated for COVID -19. 
 The current study  is sponsored by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH). The study doctor in 
charge of this study at this site is  listed on the first page of this form. Before you decide if you 
want to be a part of this study, we want you to know about the study.  
 
This is a consent form. It gives you information about this study. The study staff will talk with you 
about this information. You are free to ask questions about this study at any time. If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to sign and date this consent form. You will get a copy to keep.  
 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_359858] received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the 
FDA. This means that they became available for use more quickly than usual. The Moderna 
mRNA-1273 vaccine received full FDA approval. Some of these treatments and vaccines are 
being evaluated in clinical trials, such as ACTIV -2/A5401 and this study (A5404). 
 People who have previously experienced SARS- CoV-2 infection can get it again, and it is not 
known if active viral infection generates a weaker immune response than what can be elicited 
by a COVID -19 vaccine.   
 This study is for people who had COVID-19 and participated in ACTIV -2/A5401 and recei ved 
either experimental treatment, a standard of care COVID -[ADDRESS_359859] previously had COVID -19. 
 Enrollment for this study closed on February 25, 2022, due to slow enrollment . Vaccine 
responses will be studied in the 43 participants enrolled. Your continued participation is 
appreciated.

 WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO IF I AM IN THIS STUDY? 
 
Location of Study Visits  
Your study visits will take place in person or remotely. You and the study staff at your  study 
site will discuss the location for each visit.  
• In-person visits will take place at the clinic, at your home, or at another non-clinic location. 
• Remote visits will take place over the phone or via telemedicine systems approved for use at 
your study site. 
 
Information Collected at Screening 
There is some information that we collect on everyone who is screened for an AIDS Clinical 
Trials Group (ACTG , part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an institute  
of the NIH)  study. As part of your screening visit, some demographic (for example, age, gender, 
race) and clinical (for example, disease condition, diagnosis) information will be collected from 
you. We also collect information on whether you use (or have used)  injection drugs.  
  We will collect this information even if you do not enroll in this study. This information is collected so that ACTG researchers may determine whether  there are patterns and/or common 
reasons why people do not join a study . 
 
Blood Drawn 
The study  site staff can tell you how much blood will be collected at any particular visit.  
 
Screening Visit  
If you would like to be in this study, after you have read, signed, and dated this consent form, 
you will have a screening visit to make sure you meet the requirements for joining the study. 
This visit will take about 1 hour. You may come to the clinic, or if it is possible or necessary, this 
visit might be done remotely  (for example, by [CONTACT_756]) . 
 At this visit:  
• Study staff will tell you more about the study . 
• If you will receive the study -provided Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine, then study 
staff will tell you about that study vaccine . 
• If you are receiving a  community -provided mRNA COVID -19 vaccine, then study staff will ask 
you which vaccine (for example, [COMPANY_007] or Moderna) you are getting and when you received 
or are scheduled to receive your first  and (if applicable) second  vaccine doses . 
• If you were a participant in the A5401/ACTIV -2 study : Study  staff will review your history and 
confirm  your participation in ACTIV -2/A5401.  
• You will be asked about  any symptoms  you are
 experiencing. 
• Study  staff will ask you about your allergy history, any health conditions  you have, and 
questions  about your health in general.  
• Study staff will ask you about your medication history and any medications you are taking. 
• You may have a brief physical exam if your screening visit takes place at the clinic.  
 
Entry Visit  
If you qualify for the study, you will have an entry visit. This visit might occur on the same day as your screening visit.

Genetic Testing  
Your body, like all living things, is made up of cells. Cells contain deoxyribonucleic acid, also 
known as “DNA .” DNA is like a string of information put together in a certain order. Parts of the 
string make up “genes .” Genes contain instructions on how to make your body work and fi ght 
disease. These genes direct the cells to make particular sequences or types of ribonucleic acid, 
also known as “RNA.” Differences or changes in DNA and RNA  explain some of the physical 
differences among people. These differences partly explain why some people get diseases 
such as cancer or diabetes while others do not. Genetic testing looks at the differences in 
people’s DNA  and RNA. This testing also looks at how differences affect health and the body’s 
response to disease, treatment, and vaccination.  
 
If you agree, some of your blood that is collected will be used to study  whether there are genetic 
differences in how people respond to study drugs. This genetic testing might include whole 
genome sequencing (WGS)  for DNA  and gene expression  for RNA . “Sequencing” is looking at 
the order of a person’s genes to see how this order is different from the order of other  people to 
see if these differences are associated with different disease states or immune responses . You 
must agree to participate in this genetic testing in order to participate in this study.

If I have to permanently stop taking study -
 provided Moderna mRNA-[ADDRESS_359879] the study, how would the Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID -19 vaccine be provided?  
 
During the study:  
If you must permanently stop receiving study -provided Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID -19 vaccine 
before your study participation is over, the study staff will discuss other options that may be of benefit to you.   WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
 The study -provided Moderna mRNA- [ADDRESS_359880] questions concerning the additional Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine side effects please ask the medical study  staff at your site.  
 There is a risk of serious and/or life- threatening side effects when non-study medications are 
taken with the Moderna mRNA -[ADDRESS_359881] tell the study doctor or nurse 
before enrolling in any other clinical trials while on this study.  
 
Since we do not fully understand the Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID-19 vaccine’s  effectiveness 
in participants who have previously had COVID -19, it is recommended that you continue to take 
general precautions ( for example, physical distancing, wearing a mask) to reduce the risk o f 
infection.

 Risks of the  Study -provided Moderna mRNA-[ADDRESS_359882] of care COVID -19 treatment in the ACTIV -2/A5401 study:  
• The study -provided Moderna mRNA -[ADDRESS_359883] been reported with the study -provided Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID-19 
vaccine  include :  
• Injection site reactions: pain, itching, tenderness and swelling of the lymph nodes in the 
same arm of the injection, swelling (hardness) redness, and formation of an ulceration (a 
break in the skin) or infection. 
• General side effects: fatigue (tiredness), headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, 
vomiting, fever, and mild abdominal pain. 
• Other: facial flushing (redness), generalized itching, tingling of face or extremities, runny 
nose, sneezing, hypotension (low blood pressure), hives, and  pruritus (itching). 
 
There is a very small chance that the study -provided Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID -19 vaccine  
could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a 
few minutes to 1 hour after getting a dose of the study -provided Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID -
19 vaccine. For this  reason, you will be asked to stay at the study site where you received your 
vaccine for  about 30 minutes  after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include:  
• Difficulty breathing or swallowing  
• Chest tightness  
• Shortness of breath 
• Coughing 
• Wheezing  
• Swelling of your face and throat 
• A fast heartbeat 
• A bad rash all over your body  
• Vomiting 
• Abdominal pain 
• Dizziness and weakness  
• Fainting (loss of consciousness), convulsions (like a seizure)   
 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after getting the study-provided 
Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID-19 vaccine. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, 
and pericarditis is inflammation of the lining around the heart. In both cases, the body’s 
immune system is causing inflammation in response to the vaccine. Symptoms can 
include chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]. Symptoms usually start within a

 few days after receipt of the Moderna mRNA -[ADDRESS_359884] numbers in males under the 
age of 40 years following a second dose of mRNA vaccines (including the COVID -19 
vaccine) , but cases have been reported in older males and in females as well, and also 
following other doses. Risk for myocarditis and pericarditis has been observed to be 
highest in males between [ADDRESS_359885] people with some management. 
Information is not yet available about the potential long-term affects of myocarditis and 
pericarditis in these people. While there is limited data on the risk of myocarditis and 
pericarditis in children younger than 12 years old (especially compared to the risk data that 
is available in adolescents and adults), it is an area of science that is currently being studied.  
 
Please let a member of the study staff know if you experience any of the following 
symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis, following vaccination provided through the study:  
• Chest pain 
• Shortness of breath 
• A fast heartbeat, fluttering, or pounding heart 
 Study staff will provide you with appropriate contact [CONTACT_295205].   You should not get the study -provided Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID -19 vaccine if you:  
• Had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine. 
• Had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine. 
 Serious and unexpected side effects may also occur.  
 
Risks of Blood Collection 
Having blood collected may cause some discomfort, bleeding, bruising, and/or swelling where 
the needle enters the body, and in rare cases it may result in fainting. There is a small risk of infection.  
  ARE THERE RISKS RELATED TO PREGNANCY AND BREASTFEEDING ? 
 
Pregnancy  
If at any point during the study you think you may be pregnant, you should let the staff at your 
site know so that a pregnancy test can be done.  
 
If you become pregnant after the first dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine but prior to the 
second dose, you are eligible to receive the second dose. If you choose not to receive the

pregnancy, then study staff will request permission to contact [CONTACT_295207].  
 
If you are receiving t he study -provided Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine : 
There is limited data regarding the use of mRNA  COVID -19 vaccines  in people who are 
pregnant. T he American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG  suggests  offering 
vaccination in pregnant and breastfeeding individuals if they are at risk for COVID -19 if they 
meet the criteria for vaccination based on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 
(ACIP) recommending priority groups for vaccination. T he Center s for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) has recently classified pregnant and breastfeeding individuals at increased risk of severe illness or death from COVID -19. Therefore, pregnant individuals are eligible to 
participate in this study.  
 The study -provided Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID -19 vaccine may involve  risks to you (or to the 
embryo or fetus, if you or your partner
 become pregnant), which  are currently  unforeseen.  
 
Breastfeeding 
If you are receiving the study -provided Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine: It is not 
known if the Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine is safe to use in people who are 
breastfeeding; however, you are eligible to receive this vaccine  if you are breastfeeding. 
  
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
There is increasing evidence that COVID -[ADDRESS_359886] future COVID -19 (SARS-CoV -2 infection), 
whether you have been infected previously or not.  
  WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO I HAVE BESIDES THIS STUDY?  
 Instead of being in this study  you have  the choice  of: 
• Obtaining a COVID-19 vaccine in the community. 
• Obtaining an experimental  COVID -19 vaccine , if you qualify. 
• No vaccination. 
 Please talk to your doctor about these and other choices available to you. Your doctor will explain the risks and benefits of these choices.

 CONSENT FOR OPTIONAL  USE OF EXTRA  SAMPLES IN OTHER STUDIES  
Everything in the main study consent you signed and dated above still applies to your 
participation unless otherwise noted below. 
 When samples are no longer  needed for this study,  the AIDS CLINICAL TRIALS GROUP 
(ACTG ) may want to use them  in other  studies  and share them  with other researchers.  These 
samples  are called “extra samples .” The ACTG will only  allow  your extra samples  to be used in 
other studies  if you agree to this. If you have any questions, please ask.  
 Identifiers will be removed from your samples and from any private information that has been collected about you. This means that no one looking at the labels or at other information will know that the samples or information came from you.  
 
Extra samples are stored  in a secure central place called a repository.  Your samples  will be 
stored  in the ACTG repository  located in the [LOCATION_002].  
 
There is no limit on how  long your extra samples  will be stored . [Site: Revise the previous
 
sentence  to insert  limits, if your  regulatory authority imposes them.]  
 
When a researcher wants to use your samples and information, their research plan must be 
approved by [CONTACT_163426]. Also, the researcher’s I nstitutional Review Board (IRB) or ethics 
committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106954]’s IRB/EC/RE is 
also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs  and ECs protect the rights and well -being 
of people in research. If the research plan is approved, the ACTG will send your samples to the 
researcher’s location. This means that researchers who are not part of the study  team may use 
your samples without asking you again for your consent.  
 You will not be paid for your samples. Also, a researcher may make  a new scientific  discovery  or 
product based on the use of your samples.  If this happens,  there is no plan to share any money  
with you.  
 You may withdraw your consent for research on your extra samples at any time, and the specimens will be discarded.  Please choose the response that matches what you want by [CONTACT_163435]. Please ask the study staff  any questions that you have before you indicate your 
selection.  
 
Research without Human Genetic Testing  
If you agree, your extra samples may be stored (as described above) and used for ACTG -
approved research that does not include human genetic testing. 
____ (initials) I understand and I agree to this storage and possible use of my samples .  
OR 
____ (initials) I understand but I do not agree to this storage and possible use of my samples .

Confident ial and Propri etary 7 ABI-007-PANC -003 Amendment 5 Final: 03 Sep 2019Study Population
The study  will enroll adul t male and female subjects with confirmed resected pancreat ic 
adenocarcino ma with macroscopic co mplete resectio n (R0 and R1) and no evidence of 
metastases.  Subjects will consent for study  parti cipati on postresecti on, however, subjects shoul d
be randomized to the study as early  as adequately recovered from surgery , but no later than [ADDRESS_522510] an Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) 
perform ance status of 0 or 1 at screening, i e, ≤[ADDRESS_522511] that is required for 
primary , secondary , and/or expl oratory  analysis, a s pre -specified in the protocol.
Study Treatments
Arm A will receive nab-pacli taxel 125 mg/m2administered IV followed by [CONTACT_414452]
1000 mg/m2given intravenously  (IV)weekly on Days 1, 8 ,and 15 of a 28 -day cycle for a total 
of 6 cycles.
Arm B will  receive gemci tabine 1000 m g/m2administered IV weekly on Days 1, 8 ,and 15 of a 
28-day cycle for a total of 6 cycles.
Dose interruptions ,and up to 2 dose reductions to 100 mg/m2and 75 m g/m2for nab-paclitaxel
and 800 mg/m2and 600 m g/m2for gem citabine ,are allowed .
Overview of Efficacy Assessments
Subjects will be assessed by  [CONTACT_92380]  (CT) scan performed within 14 days prior to 
rando mizat ion(during the screening peri od), every [ADDRESS_522512] 24 weeks after 
rando mizat ion, then every  12 weeks for the next 2.5 years ( 130 weeks) until 3 years after 
rando mizat ion, and then every 24 weeks thereafter until disease recurrence for the next 2.5 y ears
(130 weeks) up to 5.5 yearsafter randomizat ion
.Magnet ic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used 
based on the invest igator’s judgm ent or inst itution policy , as l ong as the same m odali ty is used 
through out the study . Subjects who are discont inued fro m treatm ent prior to com pleting the 6 
cycles of treatm ent in the absence of disease recurrence (eg, subjects discont inued for 
unacceptabl e toxi city or subject /invest igator dis cretion) shoul d undergo repeat imaging unt il 
disease recurrence , death, or the start of new ant icancer therapy is docum ented.
During the study , DFS will be determined by  [CONTACT_414453](s) who are blinded to the 
treatm ent assi gnment. The independent radiologic review will fo llow a separate imaging charter.
Imaging assessments for disease recurrence will be stopped after the number of events for the 
primary  endpoint have been achieved and after the final analysis of DFS by  [CONTACT_414454].  At this point, any  ongoing subjects who have not had disease recurrence should 
follow local standard of care for any  addi tional imaging assessments.

Overview of Safety Assessments
Safety and tol erabilit y will  be monitored through continuous reporting of adverse events (AEs), 
AEs of special  interest (identified based on previo us experience in a similar populat ion, 
including such AEs as myelo suppressio n, pneumo nitis, and sepsis) , laboratory abnorm alities, and 
incidence of subjects experiencing dose modifications, dose delay/dose not given, dose 
interrupti ons, and/or premature discont inuat ion of IPdue to an AE. All AEs will be recorded by  
[CONTACT_414455] [ADDRESS_522514] dose 
of IP and those serious adverse events ( SAEs )made known to the invest igator at any t ime 
thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP. 
Physical examinat ion (source documented only ), vital signs, l aboratory  assessments (eg ,serum 
chemistry , hematol ogy), peri pheral  neuropathy  and ECOG perform ance status will be monitored.
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) will be fo llowed unt il reso lution. Laboratory  analysis 
will be performed as per study  schedule.
Overview of Stat istical Methods
This Phase 3 rando mized study is designed to compare the DFS of nab-paclitaxel plus 
gemcitabine versus gem citabine al one as adjuvant therapy  in subjects with resected pancreat ic 
adenocarcino ma.  A permuted- block rando mization method and an Interactive Rando mizat ion 
Techno logy (IRT) will be used to carry  out a central rando mization. One interim analysis for 
safet y is planned after the first [ADDRESS_522515] completed 2 cy cles of treatm ent, and 1 interim 
analysis on efficacy is planned after observing 163 DFS events to assess futilit y. A second 
interim analysis on efficacy  had been planned for futilit y and superiori ty after observing 70% 
DFS events or enrollment of [ADDRESS_522516] (IP). To avoid premature interruption of the 
trial, and to ensure that the study  has sufficient duration of fo llow-up to verify clinical benefit 
and assess benefit -risk in this setting, this second interim analysis has been removed fro m the 
study . An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to review the 
interim safet y and efficacy data.
Efficacy Analy ses:
The primary  efficacy  endpoint i s DFS, which i s defined as the time from the date of 
rando mizat ion to the date of disease recurrence or death, whichever is earlier. Disease recurrence 
will be determined by [CONTACT_414456] (or MRI) scans.  The survival 
distribut ion of DFS will be est imate d using the Kaplan -Meier method ; medians and two
-sided 
95% confidence intervals (CI s) will  be provi ded by  [CONTACT_414457]. The comparison of DFS 
between the 2arms will be conducted using a strat ified log -rank test, with the stratificat ion 
factors of resection status (R0 versus R1), nodal status (LN+ versus LN -) and regi on, and p -
value swill be provi ded.The associated hazard ratio s(HRs) and two -sided 95% CI swill be

creatinine by  [CONTACT_414460] .
Sample Size
The primary  object ive is to compare DFS in subjects who received nab-paclitaxel in combinat ion 
with gemci tabine and subjects who received gemcitabine alo ne. 
The hypotheses are the fo llowing: 
H0: HR A+G/G = 1
versus 
H1: HR A+G/G ≠
1
where HR A+G/G is the hazard ratio between the nab-paclitaxel in co mbinat ion with gemci tabine 
arm and the gemci tabine al one arm . 
With the assumpt ion of the true median DFS of 13.5 months in the gemcitabine arm and 18.5
months in the nab-paclit axel in combination wit h gemcitabine arm ,which is equivalent to an
HR A+G/G of 0.73, approximately 438DFS events from 800 subjects are required to allow 90% 
power to detect a 27% reductio n of risk in disease recurrence or death from the treatment arm at

diagnosed in 2008.  The prognosis is poor, and as a result, pancreatic cancer is the eighth leading 
cause of cancer -related death worl dwide, wi th an estimated 266,669 deaths in 2008 ( CancerStats,
2011).  Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer -related death in the [LOCATION_002] 
(US), with an est imated 38,460 deaths fro m the disease and an estimated 45,220 new cases 
expected in 2013 ( Siegel, 2013 ).  The incidence o f pancreat ic cancer is higher in men than 
wom en and increases with age, with 90% of pancreatic cancer present ing in subjects over the age 
of 55 y ears and m ore than 70% pres enting over the age of 65 years (Howl ader, 2013).  In 
Europe, pancreat ic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer -related death wi th 80,266 deaths 
predi cted in 2013 ( Malvezzi, 2013
).  Forecasts from the United Nat ions, World Populat ion 
Prospects, GLOBOCAN 2008 dat a for cancer incidence and mortalit y predicted that the
incidence of new cases o f pancreat ic cancer in the European Unio n (EU)to be 77 ,241 cases by 
2015 ( Ferlay, 2010
).  As in the US, the pancreat ic cancer incidence in the EU is higher in men 
than wo men (Seufferlein, 2012), and incidence also increases with age.
The pancreas is composed of two main cell t ypes: exocrine (cells that produce digest ive 
enzymes) and endocrine (cells ofthe islets of La ngerhans ,that produce among others the 
horm ones insulin and glucagon).  Exocrine tumors are by  [CONTACT_414461] m ost comm on type of 
pancreat ic cancer, with adenocarcino ma account ing for about 95% of cancers of the exocrine 
pancreas ( ACS, 2013
).  The focus of the proposed indicat ion is pancreatic adenocarcino ma.
Initial staging classifies pancreat ic cancers as resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, 
and metastatic ( NCCN, 2013).  In the case of resectable disease, the ent ire tum or can be 
surgi cally rem oved wi th curative intent, whereas for both locally  advanced and metastati c 
disease, surgery  may not be an opti on because the tum or cannot be com pletely rem oved and 
surgery  woul d only be conducted to relieve symptoms ( Seufferlein, 2012 ).  Most  patients (80%
to 85%) have unresectable disease at the time of diagnosis ( Corbo
, 2012). For all stages of 
pancreat ic cancer combine d, the 5 -year OS rate is about 6%, which is the lowest 5 -year OS rate 
of any cancer in the US ( Siegel, 2013 ). At l ess than 10% survival at [ADDRESS_522530] fatal cancers ( Berrino, 2007 ).
1.2. Treatment for Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
Surgical resect ion, using procedures such as pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) or 
total pancreatectomy , offers pat ients an improved chance of long -term survival, especially with 
advances in perioperat ive and postoperative care. In patients able to undergo a successful 
curative resect ion, median OS ranges fro m 17 to 20 months, and the 5- year OS rate is 9% to 14% 
(Neoptol emos, 2009; Neuhaus, 2008 ; Oettl e, 2007 ). 
In general, results of meta -analyses suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy  with either fluorouracil
(5-FU)and fo linic acid, or gemcitabine is efficacio us (Boeck, 2007 ; Stocken, 2005 ). A formal 
comparison of gemcitabine and 5-FUplus folinic acid found no substant ive difference in terms 
of DFS or OS. However, gemcitabine treatment was associated with less toxic side effects 
compared wi th bolus fluorouracil ( Neoptol emos, 2010 ). Adj uvant chem otherapy  with either 
gemcitabine or fl uorouracil ,using the May o Clinic bol us fluorouracil schedule improved the 5

1.3.1. Preclinical and Clinical Experience with nab-Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine in 
Pancreatic Cancer 
Preclinical studies have demo nstrated that nab -paclitaxel may  play a role in sensit izing the tumor 
to chemotherapeut icagents and specifically in creases the ant itumor efficacy  when combined 
with gemci tabine.  While the mechanism of act ion for the synergy is unclear, preclinical studies 
have generated hypothetical models.  One hypothesis is a remodeling and weakening of the 
strom a barri er, allowing the chemotherapeut ic agents to have better access to the tumor cells. 
Weakening the tumor -stroma barri er is particularly important in cancer that is characterized by  
[CONTACT_414466], such as pancreat ic cancer. In mice wit h primary  patient derived pancreat ic tumor
xenografts, nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone resulted in increased tumor 
regression and depleted the desmoplastic stroma as observed by [CONTACT_414467], disorganized, 
wisps of collagen ty pe1 fibers after 4 weeks of treatment ( Von Hoff, 201 1). In thi s study , the 
intratum oral concentrati on of  gemci tabine was increased by  2.8-fold after [ADDRESS_522534] contributed to the increased intratumoral 
gemcitabine uptake. Additional preclinical studies in a genet ically engineered mouse model of

In a clinical Phase 1/2 dose ranging study  (CA040, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]0), nab-paclitaxel plus 
gemcitabine antitumor activit y and tol erabili ty were established in patients who had no pri or 
treatm ent for metastati c pancreatic cancer ( Von Hoff, 2011 ). The maximum tol erated dose and 
recom mended dose for further studies was determined to be 125 mg/m2nab-paclitaxel in 
combinat ion with1000 m g/m2gemcitabine. 
In the subsequent randomized international Phase 3 s tudy (MPACT, CA046, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
that enrolled [ADDRESS_522536] ically significant improvement in OS and 
progression -free survival (PFS) . The median OS (primary  endpoint) in the intent -to-treat 
popul ation was 8.5 months (95% CI =7.89-9.53) with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine co mpared 
with 6.7 m onths (95 % CI = 6.01 -7.23) with gemcitabine, p <0.0001 , HR =0.72 (95% CI = 
0.617 -0.835). Long -term survival  was improved in the nab
-paclitaxel/gemcitabine arm versus 
gemcitabine al one, wi th a 59% increase at 1 y ear (35% versus 22%) and doubling at 2 y ears (9% 
versus 4%). The secondary  (PFS, overall response rate [ ORR ]) and all other efficacy endpo ints
showed consistent, statist ically significant improvements with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine, 
supporting the results from the primary  analysis of OS. Specifically, PFS (by  [CONTACT_414468]) was 5.5 months (95% CI = 4.47 -5.95) versus 3.7 m onths (95% CI = 3.61-4.04) in the 
nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine arm versus gemcitabine alone arms, respectively p <0.0001 ; HR =0
.69; 95% CI = 0.581 -0.821). The improvement in PFS corresponded to a 31% reduction in the 
risk of progression or death with nab-paclit axel/gemci tabine. Furthermore, in this study  of 
metastati c unresectable adenocarcino ma of the pancreas, subjects in the combinat ion arm  were 
on therapy  longer than those receiving single agent gemcitabine, indicat ing disease improvement 
and tol erable treatm ent (
Von Hoff, 2013 ). The suitabilit y of the dosing regimen was confirmed 
by [CONTACT_414469] y of patients did not requi re a dose reducti on, and that 71% of 
nab-paclitaxel doses were delivered at the starting dose of 125 mg/m2. The safet y profile for both 
regimens was consistent with previous reports. Serious life threatening toxicit ies were not 
increased; AEs were acceptable and manageable. The most notable difference sin toxicit y 
between the [ADDRESS_522537] ively ( Goldstein, ASCO GI 2014). The 
updated survival rates also significant ly favored nab-paclitaxel pl us gemci tabine at y ear 1 (35%

pancreat ic adenocarcino ma was the Phase 2/3 FOLFIRINOX versus gemcitabine study , which 
was conducted in 1 country  (Conroy , 2011 ).  While numerous promising Phase [ADDRESS_522538] failed 
to show si gnificant improve d survival ( Colucci, 2010 ; Cunningham, 2009 ; Kindler, 2010; Oettl e,
2005; Philip, 2010 ;Poplin , 2009 ; Rocha Lima, 2004 ). 
As a result of the clinically meaningful benefit observed in the MPACT trial, the 2013 NCCN 
guidelines were updated to include nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine under treatment option 
category  1 for pati ents wi th metastati c pancreat ic adenocarcino ma (NCCN, 2013
).
1.4. Study Rationale
Current ly no adj uvant chem otherapy  regimen for pancreat ic adenocarcino ma can claim 
superi ority and the approaches to treatment differ only slightly between the US and the EU 
(Herreros -Villanueva, 2012). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_414428] , recurrence rates are still high and survival r ates poor, and there remains a high unmet 
medical need for more effect ive adjuvant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
The posi tive resul ts from the global pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] [ADDRESS_522539] 
chemotherapy for the treatment of subjects with surgically  resected pancreat ic adenocarcino ma 
and is one of the recommended treatment sin the NCCN guidelines and a reco mmended 
treatm ent of choice by [CONTACT_414470] ( NCCN, 2013; Seufferlein, 2012 ).
The goal of adjuvant treatment is to cure or induce a lo nger disease -free period (versus a shorter 
disease -free peri od requi ring early and possibly  longer symptom  control ), thus the primary  
measurement of a disease -free state is clinically relevant. This was paramount when select ing the 
endpo int of the proposed adjuvant study. Select ing DFS as an endpo int is most appropri ate in 
settings, as in pancreatic cancer, where it is predi cted that disease recurrence represents a major 
component of morbidity andmortalit y in the treated population ( Gill, 2006). Using OS as a 
primary  endpoint in the adj uvant setting presents a major challenge, with confounding factors ,
such as the subsequent anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_414429].
The evidence obtained fro m studi es of  other cancer ty pes wi th established adjuvant therapy  
supports the use of DFS as a valid and reliable measure of clinical benefit. From both a patient’s 
and physician’s perspective, the prevent ion or del ay of pancreat iccancer recurrence and 
associ ated improved survival is meaningful . 
DFS and OS were highly  correl ated i n more than 20,000 patients with resected high -risk co lon 
cancer treated in Phase 3 adjuvant clinical studies, both within subjects and across studies 
(Sargent, 2005
). A recent meta -analysis of more than 7,000 subjects from 25 clinical studies 
provi ded evidence that DFS is a valid surrogate endpoint for OS in operable NSCLC in the 
adjuvant chem otherapy  setting ( Michiels, 2011 ). In this m eta-analysis, a high level of correlation 
was seen between DFS and improvement in OS.

medicinal products described above. This protocol proposes to address these known challenges 
with DFS in the proposed adjuvant study  by [CONTACT_414471]:
Ensure the symmetrical disease evaluat ion and assessment between the two treatment 
arms
Mitigate assessment bias from the invest igator assess ment through the use of an 
independent blinded radio logy review
Include clearly defined censoring rules in the statistical plan to address the impact of 
missing or unscheduled visits.
Based on the improvement in survival wit h nab-paclitaxel in combinat ion with gemci tabine in 
subjects wi th metastati c pancreat ic cancer ( Von Hoff, 2013 ), nab-paclitaxel plus gem citabine 
adjuvant therapy  may extend DFS com pared wi th gem citabine aloneand provi de a m eaningful  
clinical benefit in subj ects wi th surgi cally resectable pancreat ic adenocarcino ma.
1.4.1. Rationale for Stratification Factors
Subjects are proposed to be stratified at randomization based on:
Resect ion Status: R0 versus R1
Nodal  Status: LN+ versus LN -
Region (North America, Europe, and Australia versus Asia Pacific)
Theresect ion status and nodal sta tus are known prognostic factors in panc reatic cancer and have 
been selected based on their use in a previous successful Phase 3 study  of adjuvant therapy  in 
subjects wi th resected pancreati c cancer ( Oettl e, 2007 ), as well as previous reports describing the 
prognosti c relationship between these factors and sur vival. In the CONKO -[ADDRESS_522541]+ categori es were associated with lo nger survival ( Oettl e, 2007 ). Lymph node invasion 
also showed a statistically  significant correl ation with early relapse in a small retrospective 
analysis of pat ients with resected pancreatic cancer ( Fischer, 2012 ). Because of the possible 
regional differences in this glo bal study , randomiz ation will be stratified by  [CONTACT_414472] . 
One of the main patho logic predi ctors of survival after surgery  is resect ion margin status. 
Resect ion of margin -positive (R1) pancreat ictumors have poorer prognosis than R0. Results 
from the ESPAC -1 study  showed that b oth R1 and R0 patients benefit from both resection and 
adjuvant chem otherapy , but not chem oradi ation; however, the m agnitude of  benefit for 
chemotherapy treatment was reduce d for patients with R1 margins versus those with R0 margins 
(Neoptol emos, 2001 b).

6.1. Central Laboratory and Central Imaging
Central  imaging and a Clinical Laboratory  Improvem ent Amendments ( CLIA ) approved central 
laboratory  will be used for l aboratory  testing. 
Sites will be required to use the designated central lab (s)for the study . Central  labs must be 
drawn for all eligibilit y assessments, but subject smay be rando mized based on local lab result s
only if the central  lab resul ts are not readily  available to permi t randomizat ionand dosing .  The 
local lab results should be well wit hin the range for eligibilit yas to li kely yield central lab results 
that will confirm the eligibilit y criteria.  Subject eligibilit y for the study  will be defined by

recurrence, when possible . Atumorsampleshou ld be collected at the time of biopsy and sent to 
thecentra l laborator y along with thesurgica lpathologyreport. The suspected tum or recurrence 
biopsy  should represent a core needle or greater sized sample that would be sufficient for 
molecular analysis.  Data have been emerging on potential markers of  treatment resistance, and 
will potentially lead to the devel opment of new therapeutic interventi ons for these subsets of  
patients.  Therefore, it is highly recommended that a biopsy  be submitted for further analysis 
whenever clinically feasible.

Overview of Biomarker and Pharmacogenomic Testing
FFPE tumor and normal blocks: 
oTumor tissue sam ple: In order to achieve the key  object ive of ident ifying a 
biomarker, it is essent ial that the ti ssue samples be as uniform as possible. 
Therefore, primary  pancreat ic tumor tissue fro m the surgi cal resecti on is 
requested. If necessary , resected lymph node ti ssue may  be substi tuted.
oNorm al tissue sample: The normal duodenum or other normal t issue sample 
provi des a baseline for bio marker anal yses that is comparably processed.

Tumor tissue RNA and DNA will be profiled and com pared wi th normal  
tissue RNA and DNA to identify geno mic markers that correlate with clinical 
outcom ewith a key  objective to i dentify  specific markers that are predict ive 
of response to the combination o f nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Analyses of 
the profiles will be performed to characterize the range o f molecular 
heterogeneit y for the tum ors and to l ook f or evi dence of m olecular subt ypes o f 
tumors. If tumor molecular subt ypes are ident ified, correlat ions between 
subtypes and clinical outcome will be explored. Specific assays will be 
priori tized after study  com pletion, as informed by [CONTACT_414475].
It is preferred that a surgi cal specimen FFPE block representative of the 
diagnosis be sent so that sections from each specimen can be generated at the 
central  testing l aboratory . However, in cases where FFPE blocks may not be 
released from  the custody  of the si teand addit ional FFPE blocks cannot be 
provi ded from  the surgically  resected tum or, the sections may be prepared at 
the site. At least 15 slides are requested for the mo lecular profiling work (refer 
to the Laboratory  Manual for details). The surgical pathology report for the 
tumor should be sent with the tissue.
If a biopsy  is perform ed upon recurrent disease, FFPE tumor block from  the 
biopsy (or 15 slides , refer to theLaboratory  Manual) shoul d be provi ded, if 
available. The surgical pathology  report shoul d be sent wi th the ti ssue.
Immunohistochemistry  (IHC) analysis
:
Hum an equilibrat ive nucleoside transporter 1 ( hENT1 )and secreted protein 
acidic and ri ch in cysteine ( SPARC )are exam ples of proteins that may be
analyzed by [CONTACT_4658]. SPARC is associ ated wi th prognosis of pancreat ic cancer in 
the adj uvant setting ( Infante, 2007; Sinn, 1997 ). hENT1 may be a predictor of

Nucl eic acids extracted from blood will be used fo r norm al genom e (if needed) and circulat ing 
tumor nucl eic acid profiling.  The collection of a b lood sam ple upon di sease recurrence is highly  
recommended as it may provide important data on drug resistance mechanisms.  Methodologies

[IP_ADDRESS].2. Administration of IP to Subjects with Abnormal Hepatic Function
Hepati c toxi city may occur ,but it is unco mmo n.  Therefore, hepat ic dysfunction that occurs 
while the subject is on study  shou ld prompt an evaluat ion to determine the cause, including the 
possibilit y of metastati c disease and hepatotoxi city from concurrent medicat ions, alcoho l use, or 
other factors.
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Pulmonary Embolism and Deep -vein Thrombosis
To resume IP administrati on in the ev ent of  a pulmonary  embo lism or deep -vein thrombosis , 
subjects must be started o n low molecular weight heparin or similar ant icoagulationtherapy . 
Grade [ADDRESS_522579] be resolved to Grade ≤ 3 within 21 days to con tinue IP.
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Interstitial Pneumonitis
While par ticipating in this study , subjects shoul d be carefully mo nitored to prevent or minimize 
the occurrence of interstit ial pneumo nitis. Careful prestudy screening wit h continuous on -study  
monitoring for signs and symptoms is requi red. Shoul d a subject develop symptom s of 
pneumo nitis during this study , the timely init iation of appropriate management is required. 
Reco mmended guidelines are as fo llows:
1. Before enrollment, evaluate candidate subjects for familial, environmental, or 
occupational exposure to opportunist ic pathogens, and do not enroll those with a history 
of slowly progressive dyspnea and unproductive cough, or of condit ions such as

3.Infections should be ruled out with routine immunological/ microbio logical  methods. 
Transbronchial lung biopsy  is not recommended, given its limited value and risk of 
pneumothorax and hemorrhage, and should be rese rved for cases with unclear etio logy. 
4. A dministrati on of IPshoul d be interrupted upon diagnosis of interstit ial pneumo nitis and 
subjects permanen tly discont inued fro m further study  drug treatment. After ruling out an 
infect ious eti ology , intravenous high -dose corti costeroi d therapy  shoul d be inst ituted

Subjects with an added immuno logical agent m ay also requi re immune m odulation with 
azathioprine or cy clophosphamide. Appropri ateventilation and oxygen support should be 
used when required. 
[IP_ADDRESS].5. Prophylaxis Against Sepsis
In the metastati c pancreat ic cancer P hase 3study (CA046) , an increase in cases of non -
neutropeni c sepsis was observed with the combination of nab-paclitaxel and gemc itabine. An 
exploratory  analysis suggested that the presence of biliary  stents m ay have increased the ri sk of 
sepsis in that populat ion. Invest igators were to provide oral broad spectrum ant ibiotics to 
subject s who were then to init iate these ant ibiotics at the first occurrence of fever. Subjects 
enrolled in this clinical trial may not have the same risk o f sepsis as metastatic pancreat ic cancer 
patients. Subjects should be advised that there could be an increased risk of serious infect ion and 
they shoul d contact [CONTACT_85338] r physician for evaluation when they  devel op a fever. Fever or similar 
symptoms should be fully evaluated as an early sign of a serious infect ion. Broad spectrum 
antibiotics such as fluoroquino lonesmay be provided to subjects to treat or as pro phylaxis for 
infect ion at the discretion o f the treating physician.
[IP_ADDRESS].6. Hypersensitivity Reactions
Hypersensi tivity react ions are infrequent with nab-paclitaxel . If they  do occur, minor symptoms 
such as flushing, skin react ions, dyspnea, hypotensio n, or tachy cardia may  require tem porary  
interrupti on of  the infusio n. However, severe reactio ns, such as hypotensio n requiring treatment, 
dyspnea requi ring bronchodilators, angioedema, or generalized urticaria require immediate 
discontinuat ion of IP administration and aggressive symptom atic therapy.
Subjects who develop a severe hypersensit ivity reacti on to nab-paclitaxel shoul d not be 
rechallenged.

Confident ial and Propri etary 52 ABI-007-PANC -003 Amendment 5 Final: 03Sep 2018where HR A+G/G is the hazard ratio (HR) of DFS between the nab-paclitaxel in combinat ion with 
gemcitabine arm  and thegemci tabine al one arm . 
Disease -free survival was reported with a median of 13.4 months and 14.3 months for patients 
with surgically  resected pancreatic adenocarcino ma who received gemcitabine as adjuvant 
treatm ent in two separate randomized Phase 3 studies ( Neoptol emos, 2010 ; Oettl e, 2007 ).  Wit h 
the assumption of the true median DFS of 14 months in the gemcitabine arm and 19 months in 
the nab-paclitaxel in combinat ion with gem citabine arm  which is equivalent to a HR A+G/G of 
0.74, at least 489 DFS events from 800 subjects are required to allow 90% power to detect a 26% 
reducti on of  risk in disease recurrence or death from the treatment arm at a two-
sided 
significance l evel of 0.05. One interim analysis of efficacy  is planned at about 33% information 
time (i e, after 163 DFS events) to assess fut ility. The accrual rate is est imated to be 
approximately  26.[ADDRESS_522581] ion with 
param eter = -2 (Hwang, 1990) to control the Ty pe 2 error rate at 10%. The HR boundary  for 
futilit y at 33 % information t ime is ≥ 0.98, however the actual boundary  may vary  depending on 
the number of DFS events at the time of analysis.
As of April 2016, a total of [ADDRESS_522582] shown consistent ly 
thatDFS for patients may be lower than the median DFS of 14 m onths in the CONKO -001 study
(Oettl e, 2007 )
,which provided the rat ionale for the timing and duration of the DFS assessments 
in the ABI -007- PANC -003 study .
Results from the CONKO -005 (Sinn, 2017) and PRODIGE 24 
(Conroy , 2018) studiesshowed a median DFS with adjuvant gem citabine of 11.[ADDRESS_522583] ively . Based on th esenew data, Protocol Amendment 4 will revise the final DFS 
analysis to be earlier than originally  planned (489 events). With the assumpt ion of the true 
median DFS of 13.5 months in the gemcitabine arm and 18.5 months in the nab-pacli taxel  in 
combinat ion with gemci tabine arm ,which is equivalent to anHR A+G/G of 0.73, approximately
438DFS events are required t o allow 90% pow er to detect a 27% reduction of risk in disease 
recurrence or death from the treatment arm at a two -sided significance level o f 0.05. The data 
cutoff date for the revised final DFS analysis is projected to be December 2018, by  [CONTACT_9444] t ime 
438DFS events maybe reached . 
Overall survival data will be analyzed as supportive analyses. The reported median survival 
from 2 rando mized Phase 3 studies in subjects with surgically resected pancreat ic 
adenocarcinoma who received gemcitabine as adjuvant treatment ( Neoptol emos, 2010; Oettl e,

11.1. Monitoring, Recording ,and Reporting of Adverse Events
An AE is any  noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen 
in a subject during the course of a study . It m ay be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an injury , or any  concomi tant impai rment of  the subject ’s healt h, including 
laboratory  test val ues (as specified by  [CONTACT_414488]), regardless of etiology . Any worsening 
(ie, any  clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensit y of a preexist ing 
condi tion) shoul d be considered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndro meshoul d be recorded on the AE 
page of the eCRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome . 
Disease recurrence and death due to the progression of disease will not be recorded as an AE .
Abuse, wi thdrawal ,sensi tivity or toxi city to an investi gational product shoul d be reported as an 
AE. Overdose, accidental or intent ional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be 
reported on the overdose CRF. (See Section 8.2.2 .for the definit ion of overdose.) Any sequela 
of an accidental or intent ional overdose of an investigat ional product should be reported as an 
AE on the AE CRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported 
on an SAE report form and on the AE CRF. The overdose result ing in the SAE should be 
ident ified as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and CRF but should not be reported 
as an SAE i tself.
All subjects will be mo nitored for AEs during the study .  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all o f the following param eters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory , 
pathol ogical, radi ological or surgical  findings, physical examinat ion findings, or other 
appropriate tests and procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by  [CONTACT_414489] [ADDRESS_522591] ’s source documents. All SAEs m ust be reported to Celgene 
Drug Safet y within [ADDRESS_522592] igator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972], or other 
appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified invest igator will evaluate all AEs as to: 
11.2.1. Seriousness 
AnSAE is any  AE occurring at any  dose that:
Results in death
Is life -threatening (i e, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the invest igator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death fro m the AE)
Requi res in -patienthospi [INVESTIGATOR_24508]

Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect
Const itutes an important medical event
Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately  life 
threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], or disabilit y, but may  jeopardi ze the subject or 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208839]:
A standard procedure for protocol therapy  administrati on.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414443] a com plicat ion of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE. 
Routine treatment or monitoring o f the studi ed indicati on not associ ated wi th any 
deteri oration in condit ion.
The administration of blood or platelet transfusio n as routine treatment of studied 
indicat ion.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414444] a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
A procedure for protocol/disease -related invest igatio ns (eg, surgery , scans, 
endoscopy , sam pling for l aboratory  tests, bone m arrow sam pling).  However, 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_414445] a com plicat ion of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414446], practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to starting of treatment on study ); must 
be docum ented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414447] a com plicati on remains a reportable SAE.
An elect ive treatment or elective procedure of a preexist ing condit ion unrelated to the 
studi ed indicat ion. 
Emergency  out-patien ttreatm ent or observat ion tha t does not result in admissio n, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE i s considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the investigator will provide information on se verity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to IP, action taken regarding IP, and outcome.
11.2.2. Severity / Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator must assess the severit y/ intensi tyof the event.

Protocol  ABI -007- PANC -003 Celgene Corporati on 
Confident ial and Propri etary 58 ABI-007-PANC -003 Amendment 5 Final: 03Sep 2018The severit y / intensi ty of AEs will  be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to 
the current active minor versio n of NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 .
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicat ions/ctc.htm#ctc_40
AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE shoul d be evaluated for severit y/ intensit yaccording to 
the following scale:
Grade 1 = Mild –transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required
Grade 2 = Moderate –mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed; 
no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required
Grade 3 = Severe –marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414448] 4 =Life threatening –extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; 
significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414449] 5 =Death -the event results in death
The term  “severe” is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific event ( as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterio n is notthe same as “serious ,” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associ ated wi th events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or funct ioning. 
Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  obligat ions.
11.2.3. Causality 
The invest igator must determine the relat ionship between the administration of IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: Means a causal relat ionship of the AEto IP administration is 
unlikely or remote , or other m edicat ions, therapeutic 
intervent ions, or underlying condit ions provi de a sufficient 
explanat ion for the observed event
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility that the administration 
of IP caused the AE.  “Reasonable possibilit y
” means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between the IP and the 
AE
Causalit y shoul d be assessed and provided for every  AE/SAE based on currently available 
inform ation.  Causalit y is to be reassessed and provided as addit ional inform ation becomes 
available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary ,or addit ional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_27718], please provide the name [CONTACT_208924].

11.2.5. Action Taken
The invest igator will report the action taken wi th IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg,discont inuat ion. Interrupti on,or reduction of IP , as appropriate) ,and report whether 
concomitant and/or addit ional treatments were given for the event .

requi res treatm ent, m odificat ion/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervent ion
is judged to be of significant clinical importance
Regardless of severit y grade, only  laboratory  abnorm ality that fulfillsa seri ousness cri terion 
needs to be documented as anSAE . 
If a laboratory  abnorm ality is one com ponent of a di agnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis

This amendment is being issued since the primary endpo int of DFS by  [CONTACT_414499].  At this point, some procedures can be stopped as they would not be necess ary for any  
additional potenti al data analysis.  In this amendment we list all the procedures that can be 
stopped based on achieving the primary  endpoint. All study  subjects are off study -related 
treatm ent and are currently  undergoing foll owup for disease recurrence and survival ;therefore 
there is no risk for the safet y of the subjects still in the study .

Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
Revise dthe final disease -free survival ( DFS)analysis to be earlier than was originally  
planned (489 events)
The current protocol (Protocol  Amendment 3) targets5 months improvement in median DFS 
based on the assumpt ion of the true median DFS of [ADDRESS_522607] ratio ( HR)A+G/G of 0.[ADDRESS_522608] 489 DFS events from 
800 subjects are required to allow 90% power to detect a 26% reduction of risk in disease 
recurrence or death from the treatment arm at two -sided si gnificance l evel of 0.05. More 
contem poraneous Phase III studi es wi th gemci tabine in the target ed populat ion of surgically  
resected pancreatic adenocarcino ma have shown consistent ly that DFS for patients may be lower 
than the median DFS of 14 months in the CONKO -001 study  (Oettl e, 2007 ).  This provi de
sthe 
rationale for the adjustment of the timing and duratio n of the DFS fo llow-up assessments in 
Amendment 4 of the ABI -007- PANC -003 study . Resul ts from the CONKO- 005 (Sinn ,2017) and 
PRODIGE 24 (Conroy ,2018) stud iesshowed a medi an DFS wi th adjuvant gem citabine of 11.4 
and 12.8 m onths , respectively. Based on these available data, the sam
e targeted 5 m onths 
improvement in median DFS based on the assumptio n of the true median DFS of 13.5 months in 
the gem citabine arm  and 18.5 m onths in the nab-pacli taxel in combinat ion with gemci tabine ar m 
transl atesto anHR A+G/G of 0.[ADDRESS_522609] 438 DFS events 
are required to allow 90% power to detect a 27% reduction of risk in disease recurrence or death 
at a two -sided significance level of 0.05. 
The data cutoff da te for the revised final DFS analysis is projected to be December 2018.  
Although enrollment of all 866 subjects was completed in April 2016, d ue to anunexpected and 
ongoing low rate of independent ly assessed DFS events, 438 DFS events may be reached by t he 
December 2018 data cutoff.
Overall survival data will be analyzed as supportive analyses. The reported median survival 
from 2 rando mized Phase 3 studies in subjects with surgically resected pancreat ic 
adenocarcino ma who received gemcitabine as adjuvan t treatm ent (Neoptol emos, 2010; Oettl e,

Removal of the second interim analysis of efficacy 
The protocol  stated that two interim analyses of efficacy were planned: the first is to be
conducted at about 33% informat ion time (ie, after 163 disease -free survival [ DFS]events) to 
assess fut ility and the second is to be conducted after70% information t ime (ie, after 342 DFS

second interim analysis on efficacy removal on DMC review. Wit h the rem oval of the second

Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
Clarifica tion on collect ion of central versus local labs
The protocol  had stated that central  lab resul ts are requi red to determine eligibilit y for study  
entry , except for coagulat ion tests which may be done locally.  Central  labs will  need to be 
drawn regardless, and the use of local labs will allow additional t ime flexibilit y for sites and their 
subjects to ease randomizat ion. The l ocal lab resul ts shoul d be well  within the range for 
eligibilit y as to likely yield central lab results that will confirm the eligibilit y criteria.  In 
addition, s ites ha ve been making dosing decisio ns based on l ocal lab resul ts –this does not 
impact the eligibilit y of the pati ents.  
Revised sect ions: Secti on 6.1
Added language to clarify  length of time allowed from rando mizat ion to C ycle [ADDRESS_522614] me t the 
protocol  defined eligibilit y requirements (especially  disease free status) wi thin the ori ginal  
protocol  defined allotted time between screening and starting study  treatm ent. This will allow
for addi tional time and provi deflexibilit y while maintaini ng the pati ent popul ation as being 
disease free wi thin the same interval before start of treatment.
Revised sect ions: Secti on 6.3
Clarificat ion on how to define a subject that has completed [ADDRESS_522615] ions: Secti on 6.4
Clarificat ion on what is consi dered to be new/subsequent ant icancer therapy
Subjects are censored for disease free survival (DFS) ifa new anti cancer t herapy is started before 
disease recurrence or death.   If a subject only cont inues one or more of the a nticancer therapy  
(regardless of dose or schedule) ident ical to the study  treatm ent they were randomized to, it will 
not be considered t o be new therapy . This woul d not represent new effect ive ant icancer therapy  
and therefore willnot be censored .

Clarificat ion on dose modificat ions
The protocol had only allowed for two levelsofdose m odificat ions. Sites shoul d contact [CONTACT_414501] . Thi s will allow 
subjects to have access to as much adjuvant therapy  possible, based on data from the European 
Study  Group for Pancreatic Cancer (ESPAC) -3 study . 
The protocol is unclear on what the starti ng dose shoul d be if the D ay 15 dose was hel d. 
Guidance is provi ded on how to start D ay 1 dosing based off of what was done on D ay 8.  
Removed the sentence, subjects experi encing IP related toxicit ies that requi re a del ay in

Dose re -escalat ions not rel ated to neutropenia will need to be discussed with the sponsor.
For all non -hematol ogic toxici ties, both or ei ther agent can be held until improvement to grade ≤ 
1.  Thi s was changed to be consistent with the language within other sections on the guidance to 
withhol d one or both agents for dose modificat ions to ensure maximum therapy for subjects. 
Revised sect ions: Secti on [IP_ADDRESS], Ta ble 4 footnote, Sectio n [IP_ADDRESS] .1, Table 6
Clarificat ion on how to dose subjects with abnormal hepat ic function
Removed sentence that say s IP shoul d only be administered if hepat ic function is within the 
param eters established in the eligibilit y criteria.  Sites hav e reported they  do not interrupt dosing 
forsubjects with lower grade liver enzyme elevat ions. No addit ional toxicit ies are noted in these 
subjects.  This will  help ensure maximu m dosing to all  subjects randomized onto the study , and 
is consistent with other non -hematol ogic toxi city management. 
Revised sect ions: Section [IP_ADDRESS].2
The amendment also includes several other minor clarifications:
Clarified imaging scans can be done at any time during the week of the planned 
assessment with +/ -[ADDRESS_522618] anned assessment.
Clarify  that a drug rel ated toxi city should be the reason for the maximum of 21 days 
dose delay between a missed scheduled dose and the next one

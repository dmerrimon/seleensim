Preterm birth (< 37 weeks gestation) currently occurs in 1 in 8 deliveries and the majority of these infants are 
born with a low birth weight (LBW; <2.5kg), with many having a very low birth weight (VLBW; <1.5 kg).  
Although LBW is a well recognized risk factor for developi[INVESTIGATOR_246541] (CKD), prematurity and 
VLBW status have  only recently been shown to be associated with later onset CKD. Children born preterm 
or with a VLBW are most at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_246542], neonatal nephrotoxin 
exposures, and acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to complex ne onatal intensive care unit (NICU) 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  In 2013,  Wisconsin  had over 5,[ADDRESS_299957] been associated increased costs –  since [ADDRESS_299958] signs of CKD compared to those without a history of AKI in the NICU. This was 
consistent with pediatric and adult literature that has shown increased risk of CKD f ollowing an epi[INVESTIGATOR_246543]. It is clear from these studies that AKI is a significant risk factor for development of CKD and prevention 
of AKI should be a focus of all intensive care unit  patients.  
Acute kidney injury in the NICU is not only associated with long term development of CKD, but also with acute morbidity and increased rates of mortality. With AKI occurring in 12 to 40% of preterm infants, it is a 
common occurrence, particularly in the sma llest and most preterm patients. The diagnosis of AKI in the 
NICU is currently based off of a standardized definition of increases in serum creatinine or decreases in urine output. Unfortunately, each of these criteria generally change hours to days after the initial insult 
resulting in the AKI band changes in therapy are generally not made until after the diagnosis. Multiple studies have examined the use of urinary biomarkers to diagnose AKI and many of these are promising for 
early detection of AKI - but these also are most often seen after the kidney injury. Ideally changes in blood 
flow or oxygenation of the kidneys could be detected prior to injury and this would allow clinicians to change therapy immediately.  
Recently there has been increased use of a device to detect tissue oxygenation. Near infrared spectroscopy 
(NIRS) is a non -invasive skin -monitoring device used on patients to determine regional tissue oxygenation. 
Sensors can be placed in multiple locations, but most commonly the head, abdomen or fl ank are used to 
reflect brain, gut and kidney oxygen levels respectively. Studies in animals, pediatric and adult patients have 
shown that NIRS can be used to detect flow -induced changes in oxygen levels in the kidneys. In preterm 
neonates, a recent study showed that renal NIRS can be used to diagnose a hemodynamically significant 
PDA, a risk factor for AKI in nearly all neonatal AKI studies. In term neonates renal NIRS has been used in 
intra and post -operative cardiac surgery patients to detect AKI and has  correlated with changes in both 
serum creatinine and urinary biomarkers. However, no studies currently exist demonstrating the correlation with urinary output or serum creatinine (the markers used for the current definition of AKI) and NIRS 
monitoring in preterm infants.  
NIRS monitoring has been shown to be safe in multiple preterm studies. The sensor is both a light source 
and a detector used to measure the absorption of light by [CONTACT_246566]. The sensor generates no heat and lasts between 1- [ADDRESS_299959] the normal values: gestational age, post -menstrual age and hemoglobin. Given the 
large inter -individual variability, several different definitions have been used to define a low renal NIRS value:  
< 25% baseline, > 15 points below baseline and < 65%.  
Given  that AKI is common  in preterm  infants,  can lead to long- term CKD,  and current  methods  of diagnosis 
occur after injury, we propose that NIRS monitors can identify AKI in real time that may result in decreased 
rates of AKI and improved long- term outcomes.

occurs and/or how subjects are assigned to study arms or groups if applicable. At the end of each paragraph hit 
Enter. Then hit Shift + Enter.  
 
Goal Enrollment: 60 preterm patients  
Eligibility: All preterm infants < 32 weeks admitted to Meriter UPH NICU 
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Preterm neonate < 32 weeks 
2. Admission to Meriter UPH NICU < 48 hours of  age 
3. Application of NIRS < 48 hours of age (Rationale: The most rapid change in renal function is in the first 
week of life. In the first [ADDRESS_299960] shown  that 75-80% of AKI in the NICU  occurs in the first week  of 
life. In order  to potentially  capture this AKI epi[INVESTIGATOR_246544], 
but for sure before [ADDRESS_299961] AKI oxygenation instead of oxygenation during 
the time of  injury.)  
 
Exclusion  Criteria  
1. Congenital anomaly of the Kidney or Urinary Tract (CAKUT)  
 
Identification of Eligible Infants:  
Each morning the RN Shift Manager will view the NICU census and identfity subjects meeting inclusion criteria for the study. The PI, Matthew Harer, will also check the NICU census daily to idenfity subjects which meet the inclusion criteria.  
12.5 PROCEDURES Describe the study procedures or interventions that will be done at Meriter. If other institutions 
are involved, indicate how Meriter’s involvement compares to the other intistiutions’ involved. At the end of each 
paragraph hit Enter. Then hit Shift + Enter.  
 
Solicitation of Study Interest  
- Once a possible subject is identified, a member of the NICU team caring for the infant (NICU attending, 
NICU  Fellow,  NICU  advanced  practice  provider,  RN shift manager,  or patient's  RN) will speak  with family  to 
determine interest  in participating in the study. If interest  is identified,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a NICU  fellow  will be notified 
to begin the consent  process.  
 
Solicitation of Informed Consent  
- Once  an interested family  has been identified,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_246545].  
Step  One:  The Investigator  (or IRB approved designee)  will explain  the study  to the potential  subject's 
parent verbally, providing all pertinent information (purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, alternatives to participation,  etc.), and will allow  the potential  subject's  parent  ample  opportunity  to ask questions.  
Step  Two:  Following  this verbal  explanation,  the potential  subject's parent  will be provided with a written 
consent form and afforded up to 48 hours to consider whether or not to participate in the research.  
Step  Three:  After  allowing  the potential  subject's parent  time to read the consent  form, an Investigator 
listed  on the consent  form will meet  with the potential  subject's parent  and answer  any additional  questions 
s/he may  have.  
 
- If the parent  of the subject  wishes  to enroll  the subject,  a consent  form will be signed,  copi[INVESTIGATOR_246546].  
- If the consenting adult  is a legal  guardian or a minor  parent,  written  proof  (court  document)  will be 
required.  
 
Application of Probe  
- Application of regional NIRS neonatal probe (FDA approved for preterm infants) on top of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_246547] (gel impregnated gauze) barrier to the right or posterior flank above the iliac crest and below the 
costal  margin  (T10-L2) for monitoring or Renal  sat (Rsat)  levels  within  48 hours  of birth by [CONTACT_246567].  
- Application of regional  NIRS  neonatal  probe to the central  forehead for measurement  of cerebral  saturation 
(Csat) by [CONTACT_246568].  
 
(Rationale for having shift manager RN's place mepi[INVESTIGATOR_246548]: this small group of shift manager RNs 
will be trained to appropriately place the sensor and they are the skin experts for the NICU. They have the 
most expertise in applying skin protectants  like mepi[INVESTIGATOR_246549])  
 
Monitoring of Probe Site  
- Each  neonate will have  the area surro unding  the mepi[INVESTIGATOR_246550].  
 
Measurement of Rsat and Csat  
- Rsat and Csat levels will be measured continuously for the first 7 days of  age 
- Sensors will be used for as long as a value returns without signal degradation (average 4 days) 
- Clinicians will be blinded to the saturation values  
 
Record Review  
- Medical records will be reviewied for neonatal, perinatal, and maternal demographics. Vital sign 
infromation,  labs,  medications  and imaging  results  will also be recorded.  This data will be used to correlate 
NIRS values to a variety of perinatal and neonatal factors: vitals, labs, medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_246551], 
imaging studies. This data will hopefully inform future research on possible interventions to improve NIRS 
values in subsequent populations of preterm  neonates.

Study Population:  
In order to have the ability to identify a difference of renal NIRS in preterm patients with AKI and preterm 
patients without AKI, a total of 60 patients will need to be enrolled. At the time of enrollment all subjects will 
be 'normal' without evidence of AKI. The majority of these patients will likely end up to be preterm patients 
without AKI given an average rate of AKI in the first week of life of 15%. However, with only [ADDRESS_299967] a 10 point renal 
NIRS difference in these groups.  
 
Statistical Power calculation:  
renal NIRS average for AKI group = 60 
renal NIRS average for non- AKI group = [ADDRESS_299968] deviation for AKI group = [ADDRESS_299969] deviation for non-A KI group = 10  
 
5% alpha  
50% beta 
 
Power calculation for the above would require at least 5 patients in each group.  
 
With a rate of AKI of 15%, out of 60 patients there would be 9 in the AKI group and 51 in the no AKI group.

17.2 Check all the methods below that tell how you will minimize the risks identified above. Refer to the HELP 
Bubble in  the right panel  for UnityPoint  Health  - Meriter  Security  Requirements  for Protected Health  Information 
(PHI).  
  Use of drapes or barriers for subjects who must  disrobe.  
  Research interviews and interventions are conducted in a private room.  
Collection of sensitive information about subjects is limited to the amount necessary to achieve the aims of the 
research, so that no unneeded sensitive information is collected.  
  Paper  based records  will be kept in a secure UnityPoint  Health - Meriter  location  and only be accessible  to 
personnel involved in the study.  
Electronic and digital files will be stored and accessed in accordance with the UnityPoint Health - Meriter Privacy 
and Security Requirements - see HELP Bubble in right panel.  
When ever feasible, identifers will be removed from study -related information.  
  Audio  and/or  video  recordings  of subjects  will be transcribed and then destroyed  to eliminate  audible or visual 
identification of  subjects.  
  Counseling will be offered to subjects who are distressed from the research intervention.  
  Use of a code list. The code list links de- identified patient/subject data to a patient's identity. For example, in 
medical  record research,  each study  record representing a subject's  information will be assigned a study  number. 
The code list will link study numbers to medical record numbers. Researchers use a code list to enable verifying 
data.

17.5 What resources are available at the local site(s) to treat emergencies resulting from study -related procedures?  

BLS trained personnel.  
  ACLS trained personnel and crash cart. 
NRP and/or PALS trained personnel.  
  Emergency supplies to stabilize subject until emergency  personnel  arrive.  
  Emergency Response Team within facility.

17.6 *Is there potential for direct benefit to the subject? 
Yes No 
17.7 *Describe how your research may benefit a future patient group or society as a whole.  
 
Future benefits to a similar patient group would be able to detect acute kidney injury as it occurs with renal 
NIRS and change treatments to either prevent it from occuring or decrease the severity. This is not currently 
possible because urine output and creatinine changes occur several hours to days after the kidney injury.  
This may then result in improved long term kidney function for these preterm infants.

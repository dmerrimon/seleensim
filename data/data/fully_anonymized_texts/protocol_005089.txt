Cohort 1 Age Group 1 will include subjects who may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153611]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153612]. Cohort 1 Age Group 2 will include subjects who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153613].    
Cohort 2 for both age groups will include subjects who may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153611]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153614].
Additional Part 1 cohorts may be added, as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_121187].  
Part 2: Both age groups will include subjects who may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153611]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153612]. The start of dosing for each age group will be contingent upon at least [ADDRESS_177186] safety and PK data, in that age group. Twenty subjects 
are planned for each age group, but additional subjects may be enrolled based on SSC 
recommendations to allow a sufficient number of subjects to determine doses for both age 
ranges.  
Additional Part 2 cohorts may be added, as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_121187].
In addition to the SSC responsible for dose escalation decisions based on blinded safety and PK 
data, to ensure that the safety of the subjects is thoroughly monitored, an Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review unblinded safety data. At a minimum, the IDMC 
will review data for each age group from Part [ADDRESS_177187] 
Research Organization. 
The study periods are summarized below. Study assessments are detailed in the Schedule of 
Assessments (SoA). For study assessments, a subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30070] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153615]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) will be based on their status on the day of the visit. 
Screening Period: At Screening, the subject’s legal representative (henceforth referred to as 
“caregiver”) must review and sign an informed consent form (ICF) before the subject 
undergoes any study-specific procedures. 
After the ICF is signed, screening assessments will be done, including physical examination, 
ECG, vital sign and body measurements. Some procedures performed as part of standard of 
care (such as an RSV diagnostic test or safety laboratory tests) may be used to determine study 
eligibility if they are performed within [ADDRESS_177188] dose of study 
drug within 24 hours of signing the ICF. 
Treatment Period (Days 1 to 5):  Subjects who are eligible for the study will be randomized 
2:1 (Part 1) or 4:1 (Part 2) to EDP-938:placebo. Subjects will be considered enrolled at the time 
of randomization. 
Nasal swab samples will be collected throughout the treatment period for RSV viral load 
assessments. At each scheduled visit, the site Investigator or designee will complete the 
Professional ReSVinet clinical scoring system. 
The subjects’ caregiver will receive an eCOA   handheld 
device. This device will be used to complete the Parent/Guardian ReSVinet clinical scoring 
system beginning after randomization but before the first dose and subsequently QD at 
approximately the same time each day ± 2 hours. The palatability question should be completed 
postdose. The device should be brought to each site study visit.   
The subjects’ caregivers will receive instructions on the proper use and care of the eCOA 
device. If a caregiver is unable to use the eDiary, a paper diary may be used.
In a subset of subjects, the subjects’ caregivers will also complete the clinical 
scoring system on paper after randomization but before the first dose and subsequently twice 
daily, approximately every 12 hours. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153616]-938 or placebo QD orally for 5 days at approximately the same time 
every day (± 1 hour). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153617]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153618] 3 should return to the study site for Day 3 
and Day 5 visits. Subjects who are discharged on or after Day 3 (but before Day 5), should 
return to the study site for the Day [ADDRESS_177189] 3 hours postdose. Subjects’ 
caregiver(s) will be instructed to administer EDP-938 or placebo QDat approximately the same 
time every day (± 1 hour) on Day 2 and Day 4. On Day 3 and Day 5 (End-of-Treatment visit; 
EOT), subjects should be dosed at the clinic. If a subject is unable to attend a study site visit, a 
home visit by [CONTACT_26271]/home health staff may be arranged, if feasible. 
Follow-up Period (Days 6 to 28):  Follow-up visits will occur 4, 9, and [ADDRESS_177190] 
dose of study drug (study Days 9, 14, and 28) for all subjects including those who discontinue 
treatment early (before completing 5 days of dosing). The end-of-study visit (EOS, Day 28) is a 
follow-up visit for posttreatment safety assessments and may be conducted as a telephone call.  
Early Termination 
Subjects who discontinue treatment early (before completing 5 days of dosing) should return to 
the study site within [ADDRESS_177191]-treatment 
follow-up Visits 1 and 2 (PT1, PT2). A follow-up visit for post-treatment safety assessments

CONFIDENTIAL also needs to be scheduled (23 days after study drug discontinuation) and may be conducted as 
a telephone call. 
Subjects who discontinue the study early (before Day 28) should return to the study site within 
24 hours if possible and no more than 48 hours later to complete the EOS procedures. 
Addition or Replacement of Subjects 
If the objectives of the study are not met (due to subject dropout, lack of sufficient data points, 
or other reason) or based on recommendation from the SSC, additional subjects may be 
enrolled. Subjects who withdraw from the study before receiving the first dose of study drug 
may be replaced. Subjects who withdraw from the study after receiving the first dose of study 
drug will not be replaced, except as recommended by [CONTACT_121187].

study drug-related Grade [ADDRESS_177199] Research Organization. Further information about the IDMC 
will be provided in the IDMC Charter. 
4.3. Alterations to Planned Doses and Cohort Progression Guidelines 
The SSC may recommend modifications, such as if: 
 More subjects should be evaluated in any cohort to more fully characterize the safety 
and PK profile of EDP-938; 
 For each age group, enrollment into the Part 1 Cohort 2 can proceed at the proposed 
dose; 
 For each age group, enrollment into the Part 2 Cohort can proceed at the proposed 
dose. 
Additional cohort(s) may be enrolled based on recommendations from the SSC review of 
available blinded data to potentially evaluate different doses, dosing regimens, or additional 
subjects at the same dose. 
Once the SSC has reviewed the PK and safety data of the highest dose within each age group that 
will be used in Part 1, it may recommend that the protocol eligibility in Part [ADDRESS_177200] EDP-938 pediatric 
clinical trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, clinical outcomes, and antiviral activity of

CONFIDENTIAL EDP-938 in pediatric patients 28 days to 36 months of age who are infected with RSV and 
who may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153611]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. This study is designed to support dose selection 
within each age group/cohort and to provide data to support dose selection for future pediatric 
clinical trials. 
4.4.1. Justification of Study Design, Endpoints, and Subject Population
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_153621], there is no vaccine or highly effective treatment currently 
available for RSV in children or adults. Currently, only [ADDRESS_177201] infection in pediatric patients: aerosolized ribavirin (a 
nucleoside analog) for treatment and palivizumab (a monoclonal antibody that targets the RSV 
fusion protein) for the prevention of serious lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_153622]. However, analyses performed subsequent to the approval of aerosolized 
ribavirin suggest that it failed to impart any clinically significant benefits ( Randolph & Wang, 
1996), and currently it is not recommended for routine treatment of RSV ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_60621] & Perez, 
2014). There are also concerns about the toxicity, teratogenicity, and high cost of inhaled 
ribavirin ( Chemaly, Aitken, Wolfe, Jain, & Boeckh, 2016 ). Current management of RSV 
bronchiolitis remains mostly supportive care such as oxygen for hypoxemia and intravenous 
fluids for dehydration. Consequently, clinicians have no safe and highly effective treatment for 
RSV infection, which is an issue of significant concern for those providing medical care for 
pediatric patients at risk of severe RSV disease. 
This Phase 2 study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and antiviral activity of EDP-938 
administered orally in pediatric patients 28 days to 36 months of age who are infected with 
RSV. The design of the study (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging) is 
consistent with recent RSV guidance from regulatory agencies ( EMA; FDA). 
While this initial Phase [ADDRESS_177202] to PK, safety, and antiviral activity in children aged 28 days to 36 months, 
we will also be exploring the use of instruments for RSV signs and symptoms that may be 
relevant to a later stage of EDP-938 development in the pediatric population. 
The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1, the primary endpoints will be safety, 
tolerability, and PK. In Part 2, the primary endpoint will be antiviral activity. In Part 1, subjects 
will be randomized 2:1 to EDP-938:placebo. The SSC will make recommendations to determine 
dose selection and cohort progression in Part [ADDRESS_177203] 2 dosing cohorts will be evaluated in 
Part 1. Part 1 Cohort 1 of both age groups will evaluate an initially selected dose of , 
which is anticipated to yield exposures that are safe and efficacious. As these exposures are 
predicted based on modeling and simulation using adult data ( Section 4.4.2  for dose rationale), 
dose adjustments based on pediatric data may be needed. Therefore, a higher or lower dose will 
be explored in Cohort 2. If adequate exposures are achieved in Cohort 1 with no safety concerns, 
a higher dose that is not expected to exceed safe exposures in nonclinical studies and clinical 
studies may still be explored in Cohort 2 to evaluate the safety and PK of EDP-938 across a dose 
range. Additional cohorts in Part 1 may be added, as needed. Following completion of Part 1 for 
a specific age group and based on SSC review, enrollment in Part 2 for that same age group may 
begin.

5.6. Treatment Assignment/Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized to a treatment group using an Interactive Web Response System. 
Subjects will be randomized to the initial EDP-938 or placebo treatment group as shown below: 
Part 1, Cohort 1, Age Group 1 and 2 (randomized 2:1) 
of EDP-938 orally QD for 5 days (8 subjects);
 placebo orally QDfor 5 days (4 subjects).
The dose for Part 1 Cohort 2 for each age group will be determined based on review of Part 1 
Cohort 1 data.
Part 2 (randomized 4:1) 
EDP-938 orally QD for 5 days: dose to be determined
Oral EDP-938 QD for 5 days: dose to be determined (16 subjects);
Oral placebo QD for 5 days: dose to be determined (4 subjects).
The randomization code will be produced by [CONTACT_153669], Inc. (or designee). The 
Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. unblinded biostatistician or designee will review and approve the 
final randomization list. 
During the Screening Period, subjects will be identified by a unique screening number. Subjects 
who have completed screening assessments and are eligible for participation in the study will be 
randomized before the first dose of study drug (Day 1). 
5.7. Study Drug Dose and Administration 
Complete instructions for dispensing and administering study drug are presented in the Pharmacy 
Manual. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153623], subjects will be administered EDP-938 or placebo QD orally  
for 5 days at approximately the same time every day 
(±1 hour) on each of the [ADDRESS_177205]’s caregiver will be instructed to bring all study drug 
to the site on Day 3, Day 5, or the End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit (for 
subjects who discontinue study drug). Both accountability and study drug compliance (via 
syringe counts) will be reviewed at each study site visit as indicated in the SoA ( Appendix 1 ). 
 the site staff will ask the subject’s caregiver why 
any doses were missed, including administration of partial doses, if applicable. Repeated 
noncompliance of study drug dosing for any subject, despi[INVESTIGATOR_153624], 
should be discussed by [CONTACT_153672]’s Medical Monitor to 
consider possible discontinuation of the subject from the study. 
5.8. Prior and Concomitant Medication
The subject’s caregiver will be instructed on the use of concomitant medications during the 
study. All subjects enrolled in the study must not be administered prohibited concomitant 
medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_153625]-of-study. Details of prior and concomitant medication 
use will be recorded in the source documentation and the electronic case report form (eCRF) as 
indicated in the SoA ( Appendix 1 ). 
Prior medications administered to the subjects up to [ADDRESS_177206] be recorded at Screening. Only relevant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_153626] 1 month before signing the ICF. All subjects will receive 
supportive care according to local institution standards and applicable guidelines.

24 hours of unblinding of the treatment. Information relating to unblinding (e.g., the reason, 
date) should be clearly recorded in the subject’s study file. In addition, the Investigator should 
consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding should be considered an SAE, 
according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs and, if so, submit an SAE report as 
described in Section 9.2 . 
The  will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance 
with regulatory reporting requirements. In addition, Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. may unblind 
individual subjects at any time for matters relating to safety concerns. 
Note: Investigative sites will be provided country-specific toll-free telephone and fax numbers. 
6.3. Access to Results for Individual Subjects
During the conduct of the study, Investigators, site personnel, and blinded Contract Research 
Organization/Sponsor staff will not have access to results for individual subjects that could 
impact clinician assessments, including results for RSV viral load, confirmatory respi[INVESTIGATOR_153630], biomarkers, and PK. 
7. STUDY CONDUCT AND VISIT SCHEDULE 
7.1. Study Site Visits 
Key aspects of each part of the study (Screening, Treatment Period [Days 1 through 5]), and 
Follow-up) are summarized below. Assessments are presented in the SoA ( Appendix 1 ). 
For study assessments, a subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30070] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153611]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) will 
be based on their status on the day of the visit.  
Study sites will be responsible for following up with subjects for any missed study site visits. 
Communication (such as telephone calls, emails, or other electronic communication methods) 
with parent(s)/subject’s caregiver(s) to facilitate compliance with study procedures between 
outpatient study visits are encouraged.  If a subject is unable to attend a study site visit, a home 
visit by [CONTACT_26271]/home health staff may be arranged, if feasible. 
7.1.1. Screening Period 
All study assessments during the Screening Period are detailed in the SoA ( Appendix 1 ). 
The subject’s legal representative (henceforth referred to as “caregiver”) must review and sign an 
institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee (EC)-approved ICF and provide 
authorization to use protected health information (see Section 12.1.3 ) before the subject 
undergoes any study-specific procedures. By [CONTACT_12568], the caregiver will indicate that he 
or she understands the purpose of, and procedures required for, the study and is willing for the 
subject to participate in the study. 
Some procedures performed as part of standard of care before Screening may be used in 
determining study eligibility, such as RSV diagnostic test or safety laboratory tests (as specified 
in the SoA) if they are performed within [ADDRESS_177208] sign of respi[INVESTIGATOR_153631] 7 days for Part 1 and 5 days for Part 2, before the signing of 
the ICF by [CONTACT_153673]. 
Subjects will be randomized after all screening activities that allow assessment of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria have been completed to the satisfaction of the Investigator. Subjects 
will be randomized 2:1 (Part 1) or 4:1 (Part 2) to EDP-938:placebo. 
7.1.2. Treatment Period (Day 1) 
All study assessments on Day 1 are detailed in the SoA ( Appendix 1 ). 
All subjects (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153632]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) should undergo screening assessments, 
determined whether eligible, and be randomized and dosed within [ADDRESS_177209] be done between randomization and dosing: 
 Parent/Guardian ReSVinet clinical scoring system; 
 Parent/Guardian  clinical scoring system, in a subset of subjects; 
 Clinical evaluation ( Section 8.9 ); 
 Vital signs. 
Subjects will be administered a dose of EDP-938/placebo on-site. Subjects will be monitored at 
the site for safety assessments over the first [ADDRESS_177210] of care. The subjects’ caregivers will also 
receive instruction on the appropriate storage and transport of study drug (see Section 5.3 ). 
On Day 1, one nasal swab sample will be collected.
The subjects’ caregiver will receive an electronic data capture handheld device   
 to use for the duration of the study. This device will be used to complete the 
Parent/Guardian ReSVinet clinical scoring system (QD at approximately the same time each day 
±2 hours) beginning after randomization, prior to dose. The palatability question should be 
completed postdose. The subject’s caregiver will receive instructions on the proper use and care 
of the eCOA device, and the device should be brought to each study visit. If a caregiver is unable 
to use the eDiary, a paper diary may be used. 
In a subset of subjects, the subject’s caregiver will also complete the clinical 
scoring system on paper after randomization but before the first dose and subsequently twice 
daily, approximately every 12 hours.

All study assessments during the Treatment Period are detailed in the SoA ( Appendix 1 ). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153616]-938 or placebo QD at approximately the same time every day 
(±1 hour) on each of the [ADDRESS_177211]’s caregiver will be instructed 
to administer EDP-938 or placebo QDat approximately the same time every day (±1 hour) on 
each of the remaining dosing days. After discharge, subsequent assessments will follow the 
schedule for non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26328]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153618] 3 should return to the study site for Day 3 
and Day 5 visits. Subjects who are discharged on or after Day 3 (but before Day 5), should return 
to the study site for the Day 5 visit. 
Non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153633]’ caregiver(s) will be instructed to administer EDP-938 or placebo to subjects QDat 
approximately the same time every day (±1 hour) on Day 2 and Day 4. On Day 3 and Day 5 
(EOT), subjects should be dosed at the clinic. It is recommended that the study visits on Day [ADDRESS_177212] is unable to attend a study site visit, a 
home visit by [CONTACT_153674], if feasible. 
7.1.4. Follow-up Period (Days 6 to 28) 
All study assessments during the Follow-up Period are detailed in the SoA ( Appendix 1 ). 
Follow-up visits will occur 4, 9, and 23 days (study Days 9, 14, and 28 [end-of-study; EOS]) 
after the last dose of study drug for all subjects including those who discontinue treatment early 
(before completing 5 days of dosing). The eCOA eDiary device should be returned to the site on 
or before Day 14 (or post-treatment visit 2 [PT2]). 
The Day 28 (EOS Visit) is a follow-up visit for post-treatment safety assessments and may be 
conducted as a telephone call. 
Any subject with ongoing AEs/SAEs at the EOS Visit should be followed up until resolution of 
their AE/SAE or until the Investigator has determined that the event has stabilized as discussed 
in Section 9.3 . 
7.2. Addition or Replacement of Subjects 
If the objectives of the study are not met (due to subject dropout, lack of sufficient data points, or 
other reason) or based on recommendation from the SSC, additional subjects may be enrolled. 
Subjects who withdraw from the study before receiving the first dose of study drug may be 
replaced. Subjects who withdraw from the study after receiving the first dose of study drug will 
not be replaced, except as recommended by [CONTACT_121187].

CONFIDENTIAL
Page [ADDRESS_177213] Withdrawal/Early Termination
Subjects may be withdrawn at any time at the request of their caregiver(s) or at the discretion of 
the Investigator or Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons. 
However, the Investigator should consult with the  where possible before 
prematurely removing a subject. For any subject who is withdrawn by [CONTACT_19963], the 
Investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject’s caregiver
returns all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject returns for the EOT, PT1, 
and PT2 visits (if applicable) and the 
EOS Visit, and follow-up with the subject’s caregiver regarding any unresolved AEs. If a 
subject’s caregiver withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected. Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. may retain and continue to use any data collected before 
such withdrawal of consent. 
7.3.1. Withdrawal Criteria 
Subjects may be discontinued from the study at any time if the subject’s caregiver, Investigator, 
or Sponsor determines that it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue participation. 
Reasons for discontinuation include the following: 
 AE; 
 Lack of efficacy; 
 Lost to follow-up; 
 Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130]; 
 Protocol deviation (including noncompliance with study drug or study procedures); 
 Study terminated by [CONTACT_1034]; 
 Other. 
7.3.2. Procedures for Early Discontinuation of Treatment or Early Discontinuation of 
Study 
Subjects who discontinue treatment early (before completing 5 days of dosing) should return to 
the study site within [ADDRESS_177214] dose of study drug for an EOT visit. Subjects should 
then return to the site 4 and 9 days (PT1 and PT2 visits) after discontinuation of study drug for 
post-treatment follow-up visits. A follow-up visit for post-treatment safety assessments also 
needs to be scheduled (23 days after study drug discontinuation) and may be conducted as a 
telephone call. 
Subjects who discontinue the study early (before Day 28) should return to the study site within 
24 hours if possible and no more than 48 hours later to complete the EOS procedures and return 
eCOA handheld device per the SoA ( Appendix 1 ). Any subject who withdraws with ongoing 
AEs/SAEs should be followed up until resolution of their AE(s) or until the Investigator has 
determined that the AE(s) has stabilized. 
Site staff will attempt to contact [CONTACT_153675]’s caregiver who does not return to the site for the 
EOT or EOS Visit at least [ADDRESS_177215] to follow-up. 
These subjects will be included in the PK and safety analysis as indicated in Section 11.2 . 
7.3.3. Documentation of Withdrawal of Subjects 
The reason for early withdrawal/termination/lost to follow-up of any subject from the study must 
be documented on the appropriate eCRF. If the reason for early withdrawal is an AE or an 
abnormal laboratory value, the specific event or test result, if available, should be recorded on 
the AE eCRF and the subject should be monitored until the event is resolved or deemed stable by 
[CONTACT_737].

CONFIDENTIAL 8. STUDY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS
8.1. Timing of Assessments
The timing of assessments is shown in the SoA ( Appendix 1 ). If multiple assessments are 
scheduled for the same timepoint, it is recommended that noninvasive procedures being done 
before more invasive procedures, eg, first complete  and ReSVinet Scoring System 
(parent/guardian on ReSVinet eCoA and clinician scoring could be concurrent), then ECG, then 
vital signs/SpO 2, then nasal swab, and finally blood draw. 
8.2. Demographics and Medical History
Demographics and baseline characteristics including age (months and days), gestational age (in 
weeks), gender or sex, race, ethnicity, and medical history will be obtained from each subject 
and entered in source documents and either interactive response technology (IRT) or eCRFs as 
reported during Screening. Significant medical history including surgeries will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_153676]’s caregiver. As a rule, all medical events occurring within the last 
6 months should be recorded. For events that occurred more than 6 months before Screening
(and that are not ongoing), only significant or relevant events should be entered on the eCRF. 
Any items in the history that are still ongoing should be noted as such in the eCRF. 
If there is a question concerning a subject’s medical history, then medical records may be 
requested from the subject’s primary care physician, as appropriate. 
8.3. Prior and Concomitant Treatment 
Medications taken within 1 month of signing the ICF, blood products administered within 
6 months of study drug administration, and medications taken during the study will be recorded 
with indication, dosage, route of administration, and start and stop dates of administration. Only 
relevant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_153634] 
1 month before signing the ICF (see Section 5.8 ). Subjects’caregivers will be questioned about 
concomitant medication at each study site visit. Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_153635]. This will include requirement for hydration and feeding by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) 
catheter/nasogastric tube and requirement for and duration of oxygen 
supplementation/noninvasive mechanical ventilation support. 
8.4. Vital Sign Measurements 
Vital signs include heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body 
temperature, and pulse oximetry (to measure peripheral capi[INVESTIGATOR_19365] [SpO 2]). 
8.5. Electrocardiograms 
ECGs will be performed locally. A standard bedside 12-lead ECG machine that calculates heart 
rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, RR, and QT interval corrected for heart rate according to 
Fridericia (QTcF) intervals is strongly preferred but in cases where a 12-lead ECG is not possible 
or feasible, a 6-lead ECG may be used.

Page 53 of 90
CONFIDENTIAL During the collection of ECGs, subjects should be calm, resting quietly, or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_153636]. If 
blood sampling and a nasal swab are scheduled for the same timepoint as ECG recording, those 
assessments should be done after the ECG. 
The Investigator or designee should review the ECG for gross abnormalities and interval 
measurements of concern (absolute readings). The clinical interpretation by [CONTACT_153677] a hard copy of the ECG (ie, clinically significant or 
not clinically significant). 
An ECG may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator to address suspected errors in 
performance. Before dosing, the screening ECG must be reviewed to confirm that no clinically 
significant cardiac abnormalities are present.
All subjects with new abnormal cardiac laboratory values or abnormal ECG results after 
receiving study drug should have echocardiograms. For echocardiogram results, only clinically 
significant abnormalities should be recorded as AEs. 
8.6. Physical Examination 
The Investigator or designee will perform the physical examination. A full physical examination 
will be conducted at Screening and will include examination of all pertinent body systems. Any 
subsequent physical examinations performed at the discretion of the Investigator will be targeted 
to new signs and symptoms including specific assessments of any changes from previous status. 
Only clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as AEs. 
8.7. Body Weight and Length, and Head Circumference 
Body weight and length should be obtained with the subject unclothed, in a diaper only, or in 
light clothes and no shoes, as per standard of care. Body length and head circumference will be 
documented at Screening only. 
8.8. Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in Section 9.[ADDRESS_177216] visit/assessment. Signs and symptoms that are part of the 
natural progression of RSV infection do not need to be captured as AEs. 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure all necessary information is documented in the 
subject source notes and eCRF. 
8.9. Clinical Evaluation 
Clinical evaluation will include but not be limited to the following evaluations of the clinical 
course of RSV infection:  
Vital signs (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood
pressure, SpO 2, and body temperature);

department visits, and telephone visits due to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]; 
Requirement for and duration of oxygen supplementation/noninvasive mechanical 
ventilation support (e.g., nasal cannula, face mask, continuous positive airway 
pressure) and/or invasive mechanical ventilation support (e.g., endotracheal-
mechanical ventilation or mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy); 
 Requirement for hydration and feeding by [CONTACT_153678]/nasogastric tube. 
On Day 1, these assessments must be done predose. 
8.10. Clinical Scoring Systems 
8.10.1. Professional ReSVinet Clinical Scoring System
The site Investigator or designee will perform ongoing clinical assessment scoring of the 
progression of RSV infection using the Professional ReSVinet clinical scoring system at 
scheduled time points through Day 14. Whenever possible, the same assessor should complete 
the scoring. A copy of the scoring system is provided in Appendix 2 . 
8.10.2. Parent/Guardian ReSVinet Clinical Scoring System and Palatability Question 
During the study, subjects’ parent(s)/guardian(s) will assess the severity of RSV-related signs 
and symptoms and complete the required response in the Parent/Guardian ReSVinet clinical 
scoring system using a handheld eCOA eDiary. They will also assess the palatability of study 
drug. A copy of the scoring system and the palatability question is provided in Appendix 3 . 
The eCOA eDiary will be provided to the parent(s)/guardian(s) on Day 1, and the 
Investigator/study site personnel will instruct the parent(s)/caregiver(s) on the completion of the 
eCOA eDiary. The eCOA eDiary should be returned to the study site at the Day 14 visit (or 
PT2). 
On Day 1, the ReSVinet Scoring System assessment should be completed before administration 
of the first dose of study drug. Subsequently the eCOA eDiary should be completed predose QD 
each day through Day 14 and at approximately the same time each day ±[ADDRESS_177217] the date and time of the eCOAassessments. Entries 
should be recorded by [CONTACT_153679]. Whenever 
possible, the same parent/caregiver should complete the eCOA eDiary and should be the primary 
caregiver of the child who has sufficient opportunity to notice or observe the signs and 
symptoms being evaluated in the eCOA eDiary. Study site personnel will review the completion 
of the parent/caregiver eCOA on a regular basis to ensure that the eCOA eDiary is completed 
correctly and on schedule to avoid missing or incorrect data. If a caregiver is unable to use the 
eDiary, a paper diary may be used.

9. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING
9.1. Definitions
9.1.1. Pretreatment Events 
A pretreatment event is any event that meets the criteria for an AE/SAE and occurs after the 
subject signs the ICF but before receiving the first administration of study drug. 
9.1.2. Adverse Events 
An AE is any event, side effect, or untoward medical occurrence in a subject enrolled in a 
clinical study whether or not it is considered to have a causal relationship to the study drug. An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, laboratory finding outside 
of normal range with associated clinical symptoms or suspected latent clinical symptoms in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], including those requiring therapeutic intervention, physical 
examination finding, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or 
not the event is considered related to the study drug. 
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_153684]. AEs also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_153685], laboratory test, or other 
assessments. 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153646] (e.g., surgery was performed earlier than 
planned). 
9.1.3. Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: 
Results in death: This includes deaths that appear to be completely unrelated to study
drug (e.g., a car accident);
Is a life-threatening event: An event that places the subject at immediate risk of death
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have
caused death if it were more severe;
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153647], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:
oRoutine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication;
oRSV disease progression;
oElective or preplanned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated
to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the ICF;
Clinical Study Protocol  
EDP 938-201Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
CONFIDENTIAL
Page 61 of 90
CONFIDENTIAL o Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of 
the definitions of an SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]; 
o Social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_153648]’s general condition. 
 Results in permanent or prolonged (at least 28 days in duration) disability or 
incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of a study subject 
 Medically important event: An event that may not be immediately life-threatening, or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above but is considered medically significant for other reasons. An 
opportunistic or otherwise unusual infection for the Investigator’s practice, such as 
tuberculosis, will be considered medically significant. 
The term severe is used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or 
severe); the event itself, however, may be of minor medical significance (such as severe 
headache). This is not the same as serious, which is based on outcome of the event, as described 
above. Seriousness, not intensity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
9.2. Documenting and Reporting of Adverse Events (Including Serious 
Adverse Events) 
AEs will be evaluated and documented using the grading scales contained in the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 5.0. 
9.2.1. Documenting and Reporting Adverse Events
All AEs reported from the time of informed consent to the EOS Visit for each subject will be 
recorded in the subject’s source documents. For subjects who do not receive study drug (i.e., 
screen failures), AEs will only be recorded in the source documents. For subjects enrolled into 
the study (i.e., randomized), all AEs will be recorded in the subject’s AE eCRF and the SAE 
Form (if applicable). The site should record all AEs regardless of the intensity, seriousness, or 
relationship to study drug. 
AEs (serious and nonserious) will be graded in accordance with the NCI-CTCAE scale as 
follows: 
 Mild(Grade 1): asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated; 
 Moderate  (Grade 2): minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living; 
 Severe (Grade 3): severe or medically significant but not immediately life-
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling;

 Life-threatening  (Grade 4): life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated;

CONFIDENTIAL
Page 62 of 90
CONFIDENTIAL Death (Grade 5): death related to the AE. 
Any recurrence of an AE with similar causality to study drug will be reported as recurrence or 
exacerbation of the initial event, and not as a new event. Whenever possible, AEs will be 
reported as a specific diagnosis or syndrome (e.g., flu syndrome) rather than as individual signs 
or symptoms. If no specific diagnosis or syndrome is identified, AEs should be reported as 
separate and individual events. 
An AE includes the following: 
 Progression or exacerbation of the subject’s underlying disease. Clinical sequelae that 
result from disease progression, such as pleural effusion or small bowel obstruction, 
are reportable as AEs; 
 Pre-existing event that increases in frequency or intensity; 
 Condition detected or diagnosed during the study period, even though it may have 
been present, in retrospect, before the first dose of study drug; 
 Laboratory abnormalities outside of normal limits with associated clinical symptoms 
or suspected latent clinical symptoms in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], including 
those requiring therapeutic intervention; 
 An overdose of the study drug without any signs or symptoms will be considered an 
AE. A calculated dose that exceeds its correct dose by 10% or more and is 
administered to the subject will be considered an overdose and documented as an AE. 
The following events will not be identified as AEs in this study: 
 Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, etc); 
however, the condition (the “triggering event”) that leads to the procedure may be an 
AE; 
 Pre-existing conditions present or detected before the first dose of study drug that do 
not worsen. 
9.2.2. Assigning Attribution of Adverse Events
The Investigator must attempt to determine the cause of each event. Every effort will be made by 
[CONTACT_153686]. To ensure consistency of 
AE/SAE causality assessments, the Investigator should apply the following guidelines: 
 Related: There is an association between the event and the administration of study 
drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study drug and causes 
other than the study drug has been ruled out, and/or the event reappeared on re-
exposure to the study drug; 
 Possibly related:  There is an association between the event and the administration of 
the study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to study 
drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the 
subject’s clinical status or underlying disease; 
Clinical Study Protocol  
EDP 938-201Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
CONFIDENTIAL
Page 63 of 90
CONFIDENTIAL Unlikely related:  The event is unlikely to be related to the study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than study drug; 
 Not related:  The event is related to an etiology other than the study drug (the 
alternative etiology must be documented in the study subject’s medical record). 
9.2.3. Classifying Action Taken With Study Drug 
In the case of an AE, the actions that can be taken with study drug are defined in Table 4. 
Table 4: Options for Action Taken With Study Drug 
Classification  Definition  
Dose Not Changed Study drug dose not changed in response to the adverse event. 
Drug Interrupted Study drug administration interrupted in response to an adverse event. 
Drug Withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an adverse 
event. 
Not Applicable Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply. “Not applicable” 
should be used in circumstances when no opportunity to decide whether to 
continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment was possible such as when the 
investigational treatment had been completed before the adverse event began.  
9.2.4. Classifying Adverse Event Outcome 
For every AE/SAE, the possible outcomes of the event and the definition of the outcome are 
shown in Table 5. One outcome must be entered into the appropriate field on the AE and (if 
appropriate) SAE Form for each event as discussed in the corresponding instructions. 
Table 5:  Classification and Definition of Adverse Event Outcomes 
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/Resolved Resolution of an adverse event with no residual signs or symptoms. 
Recovered/Resolved with 
Sequelae Resolution of an adverse event with residual signs or symptom. 
Is Recovering/Is Resolving Incomplete improvement to date but adverse event continues to 
improve/resolve and complete resolution is expected over time. 
Not Recovered/Not Resolved Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an adverse 
event, such that it remains ongoing. 
Fatal Outcome of an adverse event is death. “Fatal” should be used when 
death is at least possibly related to the AE. 
Unknown Outcome of an adverse event is not known (e.g., a subject lost to 
follow-up).

For categorical tests: Treatment-emergent abnormal is defined as a change from normal at 
Baseline to abnormal at any post-Baseline visit. 
For continuous tests: 
 Treatment-emergent high is defined as a change from a result less than or equal to the 
high limit at Baseline to a value greater than the high limit at any time post-Baseline. 
Results will be reported according to any value greater than the high limit, any value 
greater than 2× ULN and 3× ULN. 
 Treatment-emergent low is defined as a change from a result greater than or equal to 
the low limit at Baseline to a value less than the low limit at any time post-Baseline. 
Results will be reported to any value less than the lower limit, any value less than 
2× LLN and 3× LLN.

scoring system using the eCOAhandheld eDiary for both hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153664]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26328]. The ReSVinet D1 assessment must be 
predose, and subsequent assessments should be completed predose at the 
same time daily (±2 hr) for 14 days.  The palatability assessment should 
be completed after each dose of study drug is administered. If a caregiver 
is unable to use the eDiary, a paper diary may be used. Section8.10.2

scoring system on paper for both hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153632]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153665]. The D1 assessment must be completed predose, and s ubsequent 
assessments should be completed twice daily, approximately every 
12 hours, for 14 days. If D1 assessment is completed in the afternoon, 
only one assessment is expected for that day.  will be

Clinical Safety Evaluations
Vital sign 
measurements 
(including SpO 2) X X  X  X X X  If Screening and V1 occur on the same calendar day, vital signs 
measurements do not need to be repeated and the Screening 
measurements will be used as baseline values. If Screening and V1 occur 
on different calendar days, V1 measurements should be taken pre-dose 
as baseline values. Starting on D1, vital signs should be performed QD
on marked study site visit days. Section 8.4
Physical examination X X X X X Full PE at Screening. Subsequent PEs done at discretion of Investigator 
will be targeted to new signs and symptoms, including specific 
assessments of changes from previous status . Section8.6
ECG X X 12-lead ECG strongly preferred but where not possible, 6- lead ECG may 
be performed. If blood sampling and/or a nasal swab are scheduled for 
the same timepoint as ECG recording, those assessments should be done 
after the ECG. Section 8.5
ProceduresResidual samples from blood and/or nasal swab volume may be used for 
exploratory biomarker analyses. Section 8.14
Nasal swab X X X X X Swab samples should be taken at approx. same time before study drug 
administration. One swab will be collected at each visit. Section 8.12

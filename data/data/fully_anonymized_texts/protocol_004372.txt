OBJECTIVES : 
Our objective is to compare gastric volumes (mL) between women who receive metoclopramide 
versus placebo prior to scheduled cesarean delivery in appropriately fasted patients. If 
metoclopramide is found not to reduce gastric volumes this would inform future practice 
guidelines for obstetric anesthesia , which currently recommends metoclopramide administration 
prior to cesarean deliveries .

HRP -593 / v 03162021 BACKGROUND : 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_148450] a rare but potentially serious complication of anesthesia. Pregnancy 
increases the risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_756814]. In addition to the 
standard pre -operative fasting times recommended by [CONTACT_756824] (ASA) Practice Guidelines, the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_39870] n prophylaxis for cesarean deliveries 
recommended by [CONTACT_756825] -particulate 
antacids, H2 -receptor antagonists, and/or metoclopramide.1-[ADDRESS_1035928] of 
metoclopramide in reducing gastric volume prior to elective cesarean delivery. We hypothesize  
that metoclopramide given to women with appropriate fasting prior to cesarean delivery does 
not result in any clinically significant reduction in gastric vo lume  (mL) and therefore does not 
provide any additional benefit for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_756815]. A secondary objective will be to evaluate if gastric volume is a 
significant predictor of intraoperative nausea and vomiting.

STUDY ENDPOINTS : 
Primary study endpoints:  
- Change in gastric volume  (mL) before medication and 30 minutes after  
Secondary study endpoints:  
- Rates of intraoperative nausea and vomiting during cesarean delivery and post -
operative nausea and vomiting after cesarean delivery ( correlated to metoclopramide 
administration and gastric volume)  
- Side effects after administration (akathisia, dystonia,  abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  
extrapyramidal symptoms)  
 
STUDY INTERVENTION (S)  / INVESTIGATIONAL AGEN T(S): 
Metoclopramide 10mg (dopamine receptor antagonist, promotility agent) vs. placebo (normal 
saline). Metoclopramide 10mg/mL will be pre -drawn and diluted with normal saline into a 10mL 
syringe and stored with pharmacy. Placebo will be normal saline in a 10mL syringe. Medications 
will be made and stored by [CONTACT_966]. Patients will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1035934] the drug from pharmacy.  
  
PROCEDURES INVOLVE D: 
Study Design:  This project will be conducted as a double -blind, randomized controlled trial

Version #: 1.1 03/11/2022  
 Page 4 of 9 
HRP -593 / v 03162021 Study procedures:  A baseline gastric ultrasound examination will be performed in the pre -
operative holding area an hour prior to the scheduled cesarean delivery by a study investigator 
trained in the use of gastric ultrasound. All of the investigato rs will have been trained in the use 
of gastric ultrasound by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Banayan, an expert in point of care ultrasonography.  Gastric 
ultrasound will utilize the Sono Site X-Porte Ultrasound System  with a low frequency curvilinear  
probe (C60xp ). 
 
After the initial  examination, the patient will receive either 10 mg IV of metoclopramide or 
placebo according to a computer generated, randomized assignment in a double -blind fashion. 
Thirty minutes after the administration of the study medication, a follow -up gastric ult rasound 
examination will be completed by [CONTACT_524976]. For the gastric ultrasound examinations , 
we will position the patients  in both the supi[INVESTIGATOR_756817].  Initially a 
qualitative assessment will be completed to determine  the type of gastric content (empty, fluid, 
or solid content). Then , the cross -sectional area of the antrum will be measured  in the right 
lateral decubitus positioning . This area can then be used to determine the estimated  gastric  
volume  using a mathematical model . There have been multiple models published  specifically for 
third trimester pregnant women  including ones  by [CONTACT_756828]. and Chen  et al.12,13  
 
Following the second ultrasound, metoclopramide -related side effects will be assessed using 
the Barnes Akathisia Rating scale, a validated scale for assessing akathisia, and a drowsiness 
scale.14,15 All patients will receive odanstetron (4mg) intravenous and after neuraxial anesthesia 
performed but prior to the start of the surgery  and decadron (4mg) intravenous after delivery , 
which is standard of care. Intraoperative  incidence of patient repo rted nausea and vomiting will 
be recorded along with the administration any rescue antiemetic medications  given 
intraoperatively or post -operatively. The postoperative period will include the time until the 
patient is discharged from the post -anesthesia ca re unit  (PACU) . Anesthesia staff will be able to 
record nausea and vomiting epi[INVESTIGATOR_756818] . Intraoperative and PACU data will be collected 
afterwards by a member of the research team.  
 
Of note, administration of m etoclopramide is considered standard of care for cesarean 
deliveries; at Northwestern Medicine Prentice Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], it is usually only given to women who 
have labored prior to cesarean delivery but administration is  recommended to be considered 
according to the ASA practice guidelines. Decision to give metoclopramide to elective cesarean 
deliveries ultimately depends on patient characteristics and provider preference.

RECRUITMENT METHODS  
Subjects will be approached and recruited by a member of the anesthesia research team after 
admission for elective cesarean  section on the 8th floor labor and delivery of Prentice Women’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The study team members will use Dashboard from the Labor and Delivery Unit at 
Prentice Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_756822]. The 
research team will discu ss participation with the eligible patients and obtain written consent if 
amenable to participating in study. Subjects who are willing to participate in the study will 
provide consent on a tablet provided by [CONTACT_464]. Paper consent forms will also be ma de 
available if necessary.  
 
There will be no materials used to recruit participants. There is no need for solicitation or 
advertising for participation in the study.  
 
COMPENSATION FOR PAR TICIPATION IN RESEAR CH ACTIVITIES  
Participants will not receive compe nsation for participation in this study.   
 
WITHDRAWAL OF PARTIC IPANTS  
Participation in the completion of the survey is completely voluntary. Participants can ask to stop 
the ultrasound or surveys at any point. Participants may withdraw from the study at an y time 
without penalty by [CONTACT_756829]. For 
individuals who withdraw from the study, the data collected prior to withdrawal will be 
maintained  
 
We do not foresee any circumstances which will ca use research participants to be forcibly 
withdrawn from the study without their consent.  
 
RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS  
Risks are minimal but include the side effects of metoclopramide including  abdominal  cramps,  
akathisia, dystonia, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Metoclopramide also can cause QT 
prolongation, which may cause arrythmias in patients with QT prolongation.  The risk of saline 
administration includes  hypernatremia. We feel that these risks are minimal si nce we are only 
administering 10 mL of saline ; metoclopramide is routinely administered as part of clinical care.   
 
In addition, the potential for loss of confidentiality and the feeling of being emotionally 
uncomfortable completing the surveys. We feel t hat this will cause no more than minimal risk to 
the participants. Confidentiality will be strictly maintained throughout the study.  
 
Gastric ultrasonography is safe to use during pregnancy . There are no risks to the mother or 
fetus associated with the performance of two -dimensional ultrasound during pregnancy. The 
participant may experience some discomfort associated with the pressure of the ultrasound 
probe on the skin during the procedure which should resolve upon completion of the 
examination.  
 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS T O PARTICIPANTS  
There is no direct benefit to the participants that is associated with completion of the study. 
Future patients may benefit from the knowledge gained from this st udy, as it will inform practice 
guidelines for obstetric anesthesia.

 Page 7 of 9 
HRP -593 / v 03162021 Statistical analysis:  The primary outcome  will be the change in calculated gastric volume. The 
secondary outcomes will be the incidence of intraoper ative nausea and vomiting and side 
effects. Categorical data will be compared using the chi -squared test or Fisher’s exact test. 
Normal distribution for continuous variables will be determined using the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] –Wilk test. 
Normally distributed continuous da ta will be compared using a two -tailed t -test and non -
parametrically distributed data will be compared using the Mann -Whitney U test. The criterion 
for rejection of the null hypothesis will be P < 0.05.  
 
Power calculation:  In an equivalence test of means using two one -sided tests on data from a 
parallel -group design, sample sizes of [ADDRESS_1035936] group and 36 in the second group achieve 
81% power at a 5% one -sided significance level when the reference mean is [ADDRESS_1035937] deviation is 25 mL, and the range of the difference 
between these means that still results in the conclusion of equivalence is -25 mL to 25 mL.  
 
Data Security and Confidentiality:  Each study participant will be assigned  a study ID number 
that will be used to link study data to patient identification information (name [CONTACT_643262]) in a 
separate database. This database will be stored on a secured, password -protected network, 
accessible only by [CONTACT_30967].  The completed data forms will be kept in folders with 
only the study ID number as an identifier. These folders will be placed in a secure, locked 
cabinet in the office of the Section of Obstetrical Anesthesiology located in Prentice Women’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 9th flo or.  
 
All surveys will be completed and stored in the RedCAP online survey management system that 
is held in a secured server on the Northwestern University campus.  All surveys will be identified 
with the study ID number and will not include any direct pa tient identifiers.  When the survey is 
closed, all data will be transferred to a secure Northwestern University computer which is only 
accessible to study team members .  
 
Only study team members listed in the eIRB will have access to the data files. Data will be 
password protected using a Department of Anesthesiology dedicated computer which is backed 
up nightly by [CONTACT_756830] 5th floor Arkes Pavilion. The 
access is controlled by [CONTACT_756831]. 
Only the study ID number will be used to identify participants during data analysis. The data will 
be stored in the departmental computer until the completion of the study, including the final data 
analysis. Members of the anesthes ia team collecting these data will be educated on the process 
prior to approaching prospective participants.  Under no circumstances will individually 
identifiable data be released to anyone without the written consent of the subject. Results will be 
report ed as group findings only. Seven years after study completion, all data will be destroyed 
using departmental standards and current vendors, in compliance with NU policy.  
 
All ultrasound  data will be de -identified at the time of enrollment with the particip ant’s six -digit 
study ID number. The ultrasound  images will be exported from the ultrasound  machine on 
Qpath, which is a secure and HIPPA compliant ultrasound workflow manager. These images 
will only be accessible to study team members. All data will be st ored on the same computer 
and backed up in the PI’s office . Seven years after study completion all ultrasound  data will be 
destroyed in compliance with NU policy.  
 
All data access will be password protected and only available to study investigators listed on the 
IRB application. Data access will be controlled by [CONTACT_079]. All members of the

Study  Title:  
Efficacy of  Multimodal Periarticular Injections  in Operatively T reated Ankle F ractures: A 
Randomized Controlled Trial 
Date: 8/8/[ADDRESS_690281]: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Study Protocol:  
Periarticular fractures (bone breaks extending into the joint surface) treated by [CONTACT_531619] -operative period, often requiring high 
doses of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467]. In recent years, the high risk of mis use, abuse, and death associated 
with prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_531616]. Although physicians are being 
advised to avoid administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155], alternative pain management options are 
limited. Currently, there is a nee d to investigate different pain management models in order to 
provide safe and effective pain relief during the post -operative period.  
 
We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of peri -incisional multimodal injections as an alternative 
post-operative pain cont rol method in orthopaedic trauma patients with operative ankle fractures. 
Approximately [ADDRESS_690282] -operative pain control 
regimens in orthopaedic surgery. Goals include the  reduction of unnecessary patient suffering, 
reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and length of stay, while improving patient experience. These aims will be 
accomplished through the expansion of currently used multimodal periarticular injections from 
populations undergoing elective surgery to orthopaedic trauma patients with rotational ankle 
fractures.  
 
The study design is a prospective, double -blinded, randomized controlled trial. Patients included 
in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: int ra-operative 
multimodal periarticular injection or control (no injection). The peri -incisional injection will 
consist of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and morphine. All pharmacologic agents in the anesthetic 
cocktail are FDA approved and have been previously used in combination during other types of 
orthopaedic surgeries.  
 
All patients included in the study will receive standard post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_531617], 
administered ‘per needed’, regardless of their assigned treatment group per study protocol. ≥ [ADDRESS_690283] -operative assessments and collecting data will 
be blinded to treatment allocation. 
 
The feasibility of mu ltimodal peri- incisional injections is supported by [CONTACT_531620]. These injections may be equally effective 
at reducing pain compared to regional anesthesia with continuous infusions, and si ngle-shot 
nerve blocks.[7, 8]  
 
We hypothesize that the injection cohort will have reduced pain scores, lower narcotic 
requirements, shorter length of stay, and be more likely to discharge to home following surgery.  
We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of p eri-incisional multimodal injections as an alternative 
post-operative pain control method in orthopaedic trauma patients with operative, closed, 
rotational ankle fractures. Patients undergoing surgical internal fixation of such fractures will be 
randomized  to either receive or not receive intra -operative injections in addition to standard 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_531617]. 
 
Control group will receive no injection and will receive IV and oral analgesics post -operatively.  
 
Treatment group will receive injection during surgery into the periarticular space of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], 
morphine, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. They will also be provided with IV and oral analgesics post -
operatively.  
 
We will evaluate effectiveness of intra- operative injections by [CONTACT_531621] -group differences 
in post -operative pain management outcomes, including: (1) subjective patient pain levels via 
visual analog scales in the immediate postoperative period; (2) quantity of opi[INVESTIGATOR_531618]; (3) post -operative length of stay; (4) discharge status (e.g. SNF, 
Rehab, Home).  
 
We hypothesize that the injection cohort will have reduced pain scores, lower narcotic 
requirements, shorter length of stay, and be more likely to discharge to home following surgery.  
Following consent, patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_531622] (R) 
Random Number Generator. 
 
Patients will be blinded as to whether they received the injection or not. This is possible as they 
will be unconscious in surgery during their procedure . While an inpatient, the patients will be 
notified that they may ask which arm of the study they are in during their 3 month followup 
visit***. Until then they will stay blinded. 
 
They will then be treated with internal fixation of their fracture(s) as pe r standard of care.

During this surgery, patients randomized to the peri -incisional injection cohort will receive a 
single, [ADDRESS_690284] prior to skin closure. The i njection will be administered as such:  
20 mL injected into the peri -incisional soft tissues in a circumferential fashion.  
5mL injected into the ankle joint.  
This will take approximately 2 minutes of total surgery time.  
 
Following surgery, patients in the t reatment and non -treatment groups will both be provided with 
the same intravenous (patient -controlled analgesia) and oral pain medications scheduled "per 
needed".  
 
Following surgery, (and again at their followup visits up to 3 months following surgery) the  
research team will examine the patient medical record and record narcotic use by [CONTACT_531623][INVESTIGATOR_4408]. They will also record clinical outcomes from the medical record. 
(Notably VAS score). At 3 months the patient will no longer be follow ed in the study. At this 
point, the patients requesting information on which treatment arm they were in can be told.  
 
No follow -up after 3 months.

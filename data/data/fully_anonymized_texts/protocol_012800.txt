2) Obje ctives 
The electroencephalographic response known as the Reward Positivity (RewP) is a 
promising candidate biomarker of diminished valuation in anhedonia . The RewP is only elicited 
by [CONTACT_7324] a rewarding outcome and it scales with the central f eature of reinforcement 
learning models, the positive reward prediction error (+RPE).  Thus, the RewP is specific and 
sensitive to +RPE, fulfilling the stringent criteria of being an invariant neural marker of this 
computational process.  Importantly, the RewP is boosted by [CONTACT_363562], indicating that emotional processes influence this marker of reward learning. While prior work has effectively described these correlations (e.g. Foti and Hajcak, 
2009) , we do not know how emotion (e.g. depression) and +RPE interact to influence valuation. 
The objective of this proposal is to test whether mood directly diminishes +RPE coding in the 
RewP, or if these are separable influences on this signal.   
Aim 1:  To determine if affect and  +RPE have independent or interactive effects on the 
RewP . Based on our working hypothesis, a sadness manipulation in healthy controls should 
diminish the RewP.  Computational modeling will identify the parameters best associated with 
the influence of affect on learning, allowing us to capture the richness of these effects in an 
objective and consistent manner. Statistical modeling will quantify the independent vs. interactive 
influences of affective and +RPE processes on both the RewP and reward learning.   
Aim 2:   To determine if anhedonia and +RPE have independent or interactive influences on 
the source-level generators underlying the RewP.  We will use gold -standard source -
estimation techniques including concurrent EEG and MEG with MRI -based structural te mplates 
and an fMRI -based reward -localizer mask. These tools will be integrated to test our working 
hypothesis that anhedonia -specific reductions in the M/EEG RewP in depression will co -localize 
with +RPE in subgenual and ventromedial frontal cortex.  This  finding will identify a common 
mechanism for anhedonia -based reductions in reward responsivity.   
3) Background 
The RewP is enhanced with positive affective manipulations (Brown & Cavanagh, 2018; 
Threadgill & Gable, 2017)  and it scales with self -reported and behavioral reward responsiveness 
(Bress, Smith, Foti, Klein, & Hajcak, 2012) . The R ewP is diminished in depressed individuals 
(Bress et al., 2012; Foti & Hajcak, 2009) , particularly a melancholic subtype closely related to 
anhedonia (Foti, Carlson, Sauder, & Proudfit, 2014; Liu  et al., 2014) .  A reduced RewP is 
observed in children most vulnerable to depression (Kujawa, Proudfit, & Klein, 2014) , and it can 
predict the probability of a future major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_363552] -depressed individuals (Bress, 
Foti, Kotov, Klein, & Hajcak, 2013) .  The RewP is has good test -retest reliability (Kujawa et al., 
2017; Levinson, Speed, Infant olino, & Hajcak, 2017)  and internal reliability (Bress, Meyer, & 
Proudfit, 2015) , including reliable diminution due to depressive symptoms (Bress et al., 2015) . In 
sum, these findings demonstrate that the RewP has the sensitivity, specificity, validity, reliability , 
and prognostic value desired in a biomarker.   
2 
 However, there is no formal model of the joint sensitivity of the RewP to emotion and +RPE 
signaling, and thus there is no explanation for the diminishment of this signal in depression.  The 
core problem is that we do not know if emotion influences +RPE coding via the RewP.  The 
statistical interaction of depressed mood and poorer +RPE encoding would identify the RewP as a mechanism of diminished valuation in anhedonia.  Conversely, if these are independent 
influences on the RewP (i.e. main effects), then diminished valuation is likely to be encoded in 
the downstream targets of the generative area (likely striatum).  
The current proposal addresses this hypothesis in separate aims that will  manipulate this 
expre ssion  in healthy controls and assess these natural features in anhedonic depressed 
individuals. This contribution is expected to be significant because it will advance a translational 
mechanism for deficient valuation in anhedonia.   
4) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion criteria:  
• Men or women aged 18-55  
• In Aim 2, participants will need to either meet criteria for Major Depressive Disorder via a 
Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM -5 (SCID), or have an absence of symptoms to 
qualify as a control . 
• Free from psychoactive medication for at least 2 weeks 
 Exclusion criteria:  
• Participants unwilling or unable to give informed consent  
• Presence of other known medical or psychiatric comorbidity that in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_363553]  
• For Aim 2, MEG/MRI contraindications

5) Multi -Site Research  
N/A 
6) Study Timelines  
For Aim 1, i ndividual partic ipant’s involvement will last 2 -3 hours during 1 day.  For 
Aim 2, i ndividual participant’s involvement will last [ADDRESS_452846]  a longitudinal component where we will perform a phone interview 3- 6 months 
after the initial assessment.   This phone interview consists of a Beck Depression 
Inventory and is described more in detail in Section 9. We anticipate ongoing enrollment 
of participants for five  years . 
7) Study Endpoints  
N/A 
8) Study Methods   
Participants  will be asked to complete the following procedures : 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan(s) that may or may not involve simultaneous 
functional or cognitive tasks. Participants will lie down on a table and be placed into a long 
donut -shaped magnet. During the scan, participants may be shown pi[INVESTIGATOR_297124] /or words and will 
be asked to make decisions about the information presented in them.  This takes about 1 hour . 
3 
 Electroencephalograph  (EEG) may be done at the same time as the MRI  or MEG  scan. If so, the 
participant will wear a cap duri ng the MRI /MEG  to record brain waves.  Alternatively, the EEG 
may be performed separately. This takes about 2 hours .   
Magnetoencephalography (MEG ) record s the magnetic activity of the brain at rest and while a 
person  work s on a set of tasks. It is perform ed while sit ting in a comfortable chair in a special, 
magnetically shielded room. MEG does not emit  radiation or magnetic fields.  Electrodes will be 
applied to the participant’s head and face using a special conductive gel. These will be held in 
place wit h a cap or sticky tape. These electrodes  are used  to monitor brain activity , eye 
movements, head position, and heartbeat.  When the scan is over, all of the electrodes will be 
removed.  This takes about 1 hour of assessment and up to 1 hour of setup.  
 
Neuro cognitive testing : In order to examine specific cognitive mechanisms that may be 
associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, participants will be asked to complete tasks (e.g. 
remembering letters or numbers, deciding between different monetary options) for  up to 2 hours  
of total testing.  
 
Participants  will be asked to complete one or more of the following questionnaires:  
• Demographics (age, gender, race,  contact [CONTACT_363563],  etc.) 
• Handedness questionnaire  
• Beck Depression Inventory (BDI ) 
• Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionniare  (MASQ)  
• Behavioral Inhibition / Activation Scales (BIS/BAS)  
• Snaith -Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)  
• Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS)  
• Apathy -Motivation Index (AMI)  
• Diagnosis information (SCID)  
 
They  may refuse to answer any question at any time.  These questionnaires may take [ADDRESS_452847]  Identifier 
(URSI).  
 
Tasks:  All tasks are NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)  paradigms that have been 
previously utilized in studies of depression.  
1) The Probabilistic Stimulus Selection task (Frank, Seeberger, & O’Reilly R, 2004)  will be 
identical to the PI’s previous work (Cavanagh et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2011a, 2011b, 2014) . The 
sophistication of the three separately valued training pairs facilit ates a wide range of +RPE 
values and assessments of reward vs. punishment learning.   During training, participants 
slowly learn to select the optimal item in each pair based solely on probabilistic 
reinforcement rates.  EEG locked to the reinforcing feedb ack (“correct”) elicits the RewP.  
2) The Probabilistic Rewards task (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7293], Jahn, & O’Shea, 2005)  will be used to assess a 
commonly -observed decrement in reward learning in depression (Bogdan & Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7293], 2006; 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2005; Vrieze et al., 2013) .   
3) The Gambling task (Foti & Hajcak, 2009)  is an extremely rapid assessment (~5 minutes) of 
neural responses to reward and punishment.    
4) The Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT : Treadway et al., 2009, 2013)  measures  a 
participant’s willingness to press buttons over time in order to get reward.  
4 
 Aim 1 will assess tasks 1,2, and 3  with EEG . Aim 2 will assess task 1 and 2  with MEG and 
concurrent EEG , task 3  with fMRI, and the  4th task will only be assessed as a behavioral task (no 
imaging) . 
Mood and Emotion  Manipulations : Mood and emotion manipulation procedures will only be 
used in Aim 1 (EEG in Logan Hall) and not in Aim 2 (EEG, MEG, and MRI at the MRN).  Mood 
maniupulation will occur during EEG assessment, i mmediately prior to task performance.  
In Aim 1 a, a mood induction procedure will be utilized in control (non-depressed  partici pants 
only), similar to Mayberg et al. (1999b) , based on the suggestions of Martin (1990) . The 
procedure consists of a combination of re -experiencing an autobiographical sad personal event 
while listening to their choice of one of four sad music selections commonly used in mood 
induction (Ramel et al., 2007) .   Visual analgoue scale ratings will assess momentary sadness 
prior to, following, and at subsequent time points around the mood induction procedure .  A 
positive mood repair procedure will be used after the tasks in order to ensure that the participant 
experiences the sadness experience as transitory.   
In Aim 1b , emotional images similar to positive and negative International Affective Pi[INVESTIGATOR_363554] 
(IAPS: Bradle y & Lang, 1999)  images or emotional faces (Ekman, 1992)  will be used to alter the 
emot ional information of stimuli or reinforcements .  Aim 1b will contain both control and 
depressed participants.  
The three-to -six month followup phone interview will consist of a verbal or online (via COINS) 
completion of a Beck Depression Inventory.  If part icipants consent to a follow -up phone 
interview, they will be contact[CONTACT_363564].  If they agree, a time and method for completion (verbal or online) will be 
setup.  It should take 5-1 2 minutes to complete the BDI.

10) Data and Specimen Banking 
No specimens will be banked as part of this protocol .  Participants will be given the option  of 
having their data stored in the MRN Data Repository (see HRRC# 06 -387, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_50517]). 
11) Data Management 
Consent Forms/HIPAA Authorizations: Signed consent forms are stored in a locked cabinet in a 
locked office in Logan hall on UNM main campus . 
Questionna ire Data: All data  are coded with a unique research subject identifier (URSI) number.  
Electronic data is stored on a drive only accessible by [CONTACT_32089] a secure server.  For 
non-computer based forms, such as the neuropsychological assessments, the data collection 
sheets are stored in a locked cabinet in a locked office in Logan hall on UNM main campus . 
5 
 Behavioral and Imaging Data: All data is coded with the URSI, and collected and stored 
electronically.  Electronic data is stored on a drive only  accessible by [CONTACT_32089] a 
secure MRN server.  De -identified data resulting from this study may also be presented at 
meetings, published in journals/books, used in classrooms for training/teaching purposes, and may be shared with other researchers including scientists at other universities and institutions.  
De-identified information from this study will be submitted to online data repositories including the Patient Repository for EEG Data + Computational Tools (www.predictsite.com
) and the 
National Instituties of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria database ( www.rdocdb.com ) . 
Study Closure: At the time of study closure, all participant identifiers (name, address, etc.) will be made inaccessible to the research team. MRN retains the link between identifiers and URSI indefinitely for the potential future benefit to the research participant. Specifically, it may become medically advantageous in the future for a former participant to have access to the clinical information that may be  present in radiological scans and reviews. For example, if a participant 
has been  diagnosed with a neurological condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis, glioblastoma, etc.) it 
may be clinically  beneficial for the participant’s physician to have access to a research scan that 
was performed at an earlier time-point to determine disease course and severity.  
 Statistical Analysis: All data will undergo standard preprocessing (e.g. motion correction,  spatial 
normalization) and quality control prior to statistical modeling.  Depending on the specific question of the study, data may be analyzed using the general linear model, independent components analysis, machine learning techniques, or a variety of other standard approaches for neuroimaging data.  
12) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects 
This study is minimal risk. Any reportable events will be submitted to the O IRB within 7 days  
 
13) Participant Complaints  
If a participant wishes to issue a compliant or request information about the research, they may 
notify any study team member or the PI, James F. Cavanagh , at ( [PHONE_7472] , Monday -Friday 
from 9 am-5pm ). Participants may also contact [CONTACT_363565], ([PHONE_880], 
[EMAIL_920]. Website: http://irb.unm.edu/  
Depending on the nature of the complaint, the problem will be resolved directly with the participant, if possible, in a confidential and timely manner. Complaints that constitute a reportable event will be submitted to the IRB within [ADDRESS_452848] identifier (URSI) and kept in their respective study folder in a locked office for record -keepi[INVESTIGATOR_24069].  
 
14) Withdr awal of Subjects 
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time.  
The investigators may end an individual's participation in the study if the participant is no longer eligible, if the participant does not follow study procedures (e.g. sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_363555], not completing assessments, etc.), or if they  decide that it is in the participant's best 
interest, or the study’s best interest to stop participation.

 15) Risks to Subjects 
MRI:  Radio and magnetic waves associated with MRI scans are not associated with  any known 
adverse effects. MRI is non -invasive and considered minimal risk by [CONTACT_32096] . 
However, the scanner is a large magnet, so it could move objects containing ferrous metal in the 
room during the scan.  All participants are screened using the MRI safety screening form prior to 
be being scanned.  Participants may be bothered by [CONTACT_32097] (uncommon). The 
MRI also makes loud ‘drum’ beating noises during the study.  Headphones  or earplugs  are 
provided for protection. Rarely, large or recent tattoos can heat up during an MRI scan and cause 
skin irritation like a sunburn (uncommon).  No long-term harmful effects from MRI are known. 
However, since the effect of MRI on early development of the fetus is unknown, participants who 
are preg nant will not be allowed to go in the MRI. Females who have had their first menstrual 
period, and who suspect they may be pregnant , will be asked to take a urine pregnancy test before 
being allowed to participate in the study.  The test results will only be  shared with participant.  All 
MRI sequences used are within FDA approved parameters, including specific absorption rate.  
Due to the very high sensitivity of MRI in detecting abnormalities, there is a risk of false -positive 
findings, identifying something o n imaging studies that may or may not be important.  This may 
result in anxiety and a referral for additional medical  testing, possibly including a 
recommendation for clinical scans at  the participant’s  cost. 
 
EEG/MEG:  There is a very small possibility th at participants with sensitive skin (e.g., contact 
[CONTACT_8748]) may experience some skin irritation from the EEG gel or metal sensor (uncommon).  
 
A safety monitoring play will be followed to protect against intent for self -harm.  All 
questionnaire scales wi ll be immediately (within 1 day) examined for endorsement of 
suicidal ideation.  If the participant endorses suicidal ideation (scoring 2 or 3 on item #9 
of the Beck Depression Inventory) the PI [INVESTIGATOR_310665].  The participant will then be c ontacted in person or over the phone by a senior member of the research 
team.  Initially, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_363556] (PhD student or post -doc 
level).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_363557]: he was in a mood and anxiety disorders laboratory during PhD training at the University of Arizona and was trained by [CONTACT_363566] [INVESTIGATOR_363558] -year 
disser tation work on major depression.  This phone screen protocol consists of multiple 
steps to protect participant confidentiality:  
1) The experimenter will verify via person -to-person contact [CONTACT_363567] a “ good time to talk discretely ” prior to raising the reason for the 
call about the depression rating score for suicidality. 
2)  If the participant endorses thoughts of suicidality they will be notified of number of local counseling and psychiatric resources, including [ADDRESS_452849] of these resources has 
been attached to this submission. 
3) If the participant endorses imminent suicidal ideation, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_363559] 911 to inform emergency responders of the participant’s location and imminent suicid e plans.  Note that this is likely to be very rare.   
  
 There are risks of loss of privacy, getting insured, bei ng employed, and stigmatization.  
 
7 
 General (uncommon) risks: Participation in this study may result in discomfort, emotional stress, 
behavioral fatigue, and inconvenience.  
 
Privacy and Confidentiality:  Participation in this study may produce emotional stress, inconvenience or an invasion of privacy (uncommon).  There is also a risk of breach of data 
confidentiality (uncommon).  
There may also be side effects or risks to study participation that are unforeseen  and not known at 
this time. 
 
16) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Participants will receive a radiologist’s review and report of their MRI scan  and will be 
compensated for their time and inconvenien ce.  No other direct benefit to participants is 
anticipated.  
 
17) Compensation of Subjects 
Participants will be compensated $20/hour (Aim 1) or $30/hour (Aim 2) in cash or gift card for participating in this study.  Some tasks may have a monetary reward compon ent which will allow 
the participant to earn between $2 and $20 extra depending on task performance. Participants will 
be paid in person (or mailed) at the completion of each study visit.  This is a typi[INVESTIGATOR_363560], inconvenience and travel expenses.  
 
18) Vulnerable Populations  
There will be no vulnerable populations in this study (only consenting adults).  
19) Community- Based Participatory Research/Field Research  
N/A 
20) Sharing of Results with Subjects /Incid ental Findings  
All research MRI scans are read for incidental findings by a radiologist unless the individual has 
been scanned at MRN in the previous six months . If the scan is read, an e -mail notification is sent 
to the participant letting them know new r esults are available. The participant can securely log in 
to the COINS Homepage to access their MRI radiology report . No sensitive or identifying 
information is sent via e -mail. If an abnormality that requires follow -up is identified , such as a 
[CONTACT_32141] recommendation, a hard copy of the report may  be mailed to the participant in 
addition  to the e -mail notification. In these cases, the MRN Medical Director  may also attempt to 
contact [CONTACT_363568] . 
 
21) Research Setting 
All study procedures will take place at the Mind Research Network  or in the PI’s lab in 
Logan hall . 
22) Resources Available  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_363561]. John Phillips serves as 
MRN Medical Di rector. Located on UNM’s north campus, MRN is a 501(c)[ADDRESS_452850] current CITI and HIPAA training 
throughout the period of the study.  
23) Prior Approvals /Attachments Requiring Signatures  
Just-in-time request fulfills requirement of prior departmental approval.  
24) Recruitment Methods   
1.1 Depressed participants will be recruited from UNM Psychiatric Center and the UNM primary care behavioral health clinics (via Co -I Quinn), announcements for 
referral on the New Mexico Psychological Association and State Psychological 
Association listserv s, and community advertisements . 
1.2 Participants will be recruited from the methods detailed in the bullet points below. 
1.3 Methods for recruitment are detailed in the bullet points below.  
1.4 Flier and Online recruitment scripts are attached  
 
 Participants in this study may be recruited by:  
 
• Depressed participants will be given the flier with contact [CONTACT_3031].  They will also  be asked if 
they consent to be contact[CONTACT_38435].  If so, the name [CONTACT_363571] -protected email.  
• Posting /handing out/e -mailing IRB approved materials in locations where the general public 
gathers/there are bulletin boards available for posting/community agencies that serve the general 
public throughout Albuquerque and the surrounding areas. Where possible and appropriate, 
permission will be sought from managers/site directors prior to materials being posted.  
• Word of mouth from current and past participants, employees and collaborators, as well as other 
individuals will also be used and may include sharing approved information and/or recruitment 
materials.  
• On-line and mobile -based postings through websites and apps such as the MRN website, 
Craigslist, Google Adwords, as well as email distribution groups and listservs.  
 
25) Local Nu mber of Subjects 
For Aim 1, we anticipant enrolling N=50  depressed participants and N=150  control participants.  
For Aim 2, we anticipate enrolling N= 50 depressed participants and N=50 control participants.   
The total N for enrollment will be 300.  
26) Confidentiality  
All participants are assigned a study ID (URSI) that links their data with their name [CONTACT_363572]. All study data (with the exception of the consent form  and payment 
receipt ) are coded only with this number. The information is  maintained in a secure, restricted 
[ADDRESS_452851] participant confidentiality. Importantly, as stated in the consent, participants are informed that if they report current abuse of a child or an elder, we will rep ort the person to the 
proper authorities, consistent with New Mexico state law.  
 
27) Provisions to Protect the Privacy of Subjects  
On UNM main campus, all private testing rooms are located in a locked testing facility on the 2nd 
floor of Logan hall.  Five priv ate, closed door rooms are available to research staff for study visits 
at MRN. These assessment rooms have white noise generators outside of the doors to prevent 
conversations from being overheard. These are reserved by [CONTACT_50564], and are ea sily 
accessible. The imaging facilities also have private changing rooms with lockers for personal items.  
28)  Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
No commitment is made by [CONTACT_363569] i n this study.  This is clearly stated in the consent form.   
 
29) Economic Burden to Subjects  
Participants  will not be charged for any of the experimental study procedures, including MRI 
scans. If incidental findings from the study result in the need for further  evaluation/treatment, the 
participant or their  insurance company will be responsible for additional clinical 
evaluation/treatment that may be needed.  Also, incidental finding information is disclosed only to 
the individual participant . However, if a parti cipant  chooses to disclose such information also to 
their personal physician, this may become part of their medical record which may or may not have an effect in the future on getting health or life insurance.  
30) Consent Process   
 
Upon initial contact, the s tudy will be briefly introduced to the participant by a member of the 
research team. Participants will then be screened over the phone or in person. Identifiable 
information will be neither recorded nor retained for those participants who do not meet inclusion criteria. If the participant meet s inclusion criteria, the study  visit will be scheduled and an 
informational brochure and copy of the consent document will be sent to them if requested. When the participant arrives for their appointment, the particip ant will be seated in a private room and 
given time to read the consent form. After the participant has finished reading the consent form, 
the study is described more fully by [CONTACT_363570] r egarding the described procedures and risks/benefits.  Participants must elect 
to participate and can choose to discontinue their participation in the study at any time.  If requested, we will show the participants the equipment that will be used to perfor m the study. In 
addition, we may ask some basic questions of the participants about the proposed study to ensure 
that the participants understand the nature of the experiment.  No coercion or undue influence will 
be used.   
10 
 If there are no further question s, the consent form is signed and stored in a locked cabinet in a 
locked office in Logan Hall on UNM main campus . A copy will be given to the participant.

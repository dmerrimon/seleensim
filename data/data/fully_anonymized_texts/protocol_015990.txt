Section 1 - Study Objective, Specific Aims, Background and Significance  
1.1 Objective: What is the overall purpose of this research study?   (Limit response to 1 -2 
sentences.)The Objective of this study is to evaluate the changes in facial appearance over time in 
craniofacial deformity subjects who are post injury and/or post surgery (e.g. tx of aneurism, intercranial bleed, and tumor resections that do not involve radiation and would be analogous to 
trauma population requiring craniotomy) following autologous fat graft procedure.    
 
 
1.2 Specific Aims: List the goals of the proposed study (e.g., describe the relevant hypotheses or 
the specific problems or issues that will be addressed by [CONTACT_1758]). Facial trauma injuries, 
especially those sustained in military combat and severe automobile crashes, are characterized by [CONTACT_499624]. While the bony skeleton can often be reconstructed, the overlying soft tissue is difficult to restore. Similar deformities typi[INVESTIGATOR_499567]. Importantly, it is the structure of the soft tissue that imparts the normal human form, 
and adequate reconstruction of soft tiss ue defects allows trauma victims to reintegrate into society. 
Accepted procedures for soft tissue reconstruction of the face involve tissue flap reconstruction procedures and autologous fat grafting. Tissue flap operations are extensive, often including microvascular surgery, and do not precisely correct the deformities. Fat grafting is a less invasive technique that allows for more precise shapi[INVESTIGATOR_499568]. However, autologous fat grafts may undergo resorption that can affect the appearance of the reconstruction over time. The degree of change in appearance after fat grafting has not been well studied for facial trauma patients. We hypothesize that initial results from fat grafting for facial trauma will show good restoration of tissue volume, and that a majority of the fat tissue will remain in place over time. Additionally, we hypothesize that the cellular properties of the fat precursor cells (preadipocytes) may correlate with fat graft retention. The specific aims of the study are:1) Assess facial appearance 
and soft tissue volume before and after autologous fat grafting using CT scans, standard photography and 3D photography. 2) Assess cellular properties of the cells within the fat graft3) 
Measure of quality of life in patients b efore and after autologous fat grafting using validated 
psychosocial measures. 4) Compare the cotton rolling to centrifugation method of autologous fat grafting. This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_499625] i n subjects in this study compared to those subjects enrolled in protocol PRO09060101.     
 
1.3 Background: Briefly describe previous findings or observations that provide the background 
leading to this proposal.  Autologous fat grafting is a common proc edure in clinical plastic 
surgery. Clinical use of autologous fat grafting in humans was described as early as 1893, when Neuber published his report of transferring multiple small particles of fat to fill a soft tissue depression (1). Over the past three decades, autologous fat grafting has become a common procedure in clinical plastic surgery, and is also employed by [CONTACT_499626]. The 
refinement of liposuction techniques in the 1980’s made it possible to harvest the adipose grafts 
with low risk and without the need for a significant incision. The liposuction aspi[INVESTIGATOR_499569]- injected at a different site. Specialized equipment has been developed for fat grafting and is 
commercially available from a number of sources. The Ameri can Society of Plastic Surgeons 2007 
procedural statistics show that over 65,000 fat grafting procedures were performed in the [LOCATION_002] (www.plasticsurgery.org)Autologous fat grafting has often been used in the craniofacial 
region Of the anatomic si tes that autologous fat grafting can be applied to, a significant experience  
 
 
has been accrued in the craniofacial region. Indications include post -traumatic reconstruction, 
congenital deformities, post -surgical deformities (e.g. cancer resection), facial atrophy associated 
with HIV treatment, acne scars, and cosmetic correction of facial aging (2 -25). Adipose tissue is 
injected into the subcutaneous planes and into deep fat pads. Volumes of adipose tissue injection in 
the facial region tend to range from se veral ml to over [ADDRESS_643191] had significant and successful improvement in all subjects, with retention of volume in the range of 65%. Our basic science team recently published a paper in Plastic and Reconst ructive Surgery Journal demonstrating in an animal model that a 
manual processing technique for separating the aqueous layer from the fat graft material without centrifugation provides superior volume retention after healing. This manual separation method requires less equipment in the operating room, making it more applicable for a variety of clinical settings in the military health system. Craniofacial Injuries Have Serious Psychosocial Sequele and 
Affect Quality of Life Many individuals who suffer significant facial disfigurement from injury 
experience psychological distress and impairment in functioning not limited to the acute phase of injury but over a longer term period of treatment, recovery and adjustment (26, 27). Symptoms of 
anxiety and depressi on and post -traumatic stress disorder are common —both before and after 
surgery (28, 29). In their study of individuals with severe facial lacerations and disfigurement, 
Levine and colleagues (30) noted the “powerful [influence] of facial appearance and bod y image 
on the quality of life” of these individuals. Clinical studies of facial trauma victims, using structured interview and self -report instruments, also document the common experience of social 
anxiety and social withdrawal —problems that can significa ntly compromise social and 
occupational functioning and engagement in social and leisure time activities --ultimately impacting 
the overall quality of life (31, 32). Facial burn victims report that interactions with strangers and 
with children and adolescents can be particularly discomfiting in response to visible non- verbal 
communications of negative affect (e.g. surprise, disgust) (27). Results of outcome studies of burn 
patients suggest that personal adjustment and quality of life are better predicted b y psychosocial 
factors than site of injury (33). Pre - and post -surgical psychosocial factors such as social support, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], and satisfaction with surgical outcomes are significant predictors of personal and 
social adjustment and quality of life out comes, in addition to the physical outcomes of surgical 
intervention for disfigurement (34- 36). Significant is the fact that there are few studies of the 
psychosocial impact of complex CMF battle injuries and post -surgical changes in psychosocial 
well-being and quality of life.   
1.4 Significance: Why is it important that this research be conducted?  What gaps in existing 
information or knowledge is this research intended to fill?  Fat grafting may represent a superior 
method of facial reconstruction after severe facial deformity, but the results can be impacted by 
[CONTACT_499621]. This study will examine the impact of the fat grafting procedure on facial appearance and quality of life over time by [CONTACT_499627], assessing appearance with 2D and 3D photography and standard photography and evaluating quality of life through various validated psychosocial measures. This study will be a very important evaluation of the effectiveness o f this procedure, and will help guide clinicians in 
applying the technique. Additionally, laboratory testing of the injected fat material will be performed so that the results may be correlated with clinical outcomes in the future. The study is 
also demonstrating the application of a minimally invasive injectable technique to a very difficult reconstructive problem. The concentration of the cotton roll technique for autologous fat 
processing has the potential to further improve clinical outcomes while simp lifying the procedure.

• location of procedures   
• duration of procedures   
• timeline  of study procedures  
Upon the completion of screening procedures and if tests are within normal range (including a 
negative pregnancy test for women), the investigator will invite the subject to participate in the study. The research procedures for this clinical trial are as  follows: Pre-Graft Study Visit 
(PGSV) Collection of subject's vital signs (Temperature, heart rate (HR), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood 
pressure (BP), medication profile to include prescription and vitamins / supplements, allergies, weight, Body mass index (BMI ) calculation and Adverse Event Assessment. 3-Dimensional 
image The investigator or study staff will take photographs of the entire face (only) with the 
Canfield 3D camera system. The camera takes 2 simultaneous photographs of the face from different angl es and makes a 3 -dimensional image. The 3D camera system is not a medical 
device and is not regulated by [CONTACT_1622]. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_499574] a private room and will take approximately 10 minutes. Limited me dical 
history and physical exam with a craniofacial exam by [CONTACT_093]. The investigator will rate the appearance/volume of the graft site using a craniofacial volume and appearance grading scale. 2D Photographs the pi[INVESTIGATOR_499574] a private room and will take approximately 10 minutes. 2D photographs will be taken by [CONTACT_978], Co-Investigator on the study or a research coordinator.Digital Recordings: for subjects who 
consent, digital recordings (photography or video) will be collected at any and all portion's of the subject's pre- operative, operative and post -operative study participation. These may include but 
not be limited to, videos of personal interviews, functional assessment testing and study physical exams or photos of the subject's follow -up course, biopsies, etc. We will ask the subject's 
permission to allow Dr. J. Peter Rubin and research team to use any and all these digital recordings for medical education and training, publication and media reports -and, in any mode of 
transmission, including but not limited to: print, email, television, internet, etc. Serial Computed Tomography Imaging A high resolution Computed Tomography (CT) Scan of the face will be 
performed at Presby[CONTACT_194840] H ospi[INVESTIGATOR_499575] [ADDRESS_643197] scans will be performed on a 64- slice scanner 
(LightSpeed, GE Healthcare), using collimation of 0.625mm and slice interval of 0.3mm, resulting in approximately 50% overlap between adjacent slices. kVp, mA, and FOV will be 
optimized to the subject, but will approximately be kVp = 120; mA = 320, FOV = 18cm. Soft tissue and bone kernels will be employed. These images will be volumetrically re formatted into 
coronal and sagittal planes for confirmation of findings. Additionally, surface -rendered 
volumetric reformats will be created emphasizing both bony structures and soft tissues. Images 
will be reviewed by a dedicated head and neck radiologi st with [ADDRESS_643198]- procedural CTs. 
These volumetric measurements are expected to be precise to within 5% of the actual volume of material. Trends in volume  of tissue will be analyzed over time across the multiple CT scans. 
Both linear and volumetric measurements will be used to quantify implanted material. Psychosocial Assessment At baseline, patients will be asked to complete a psychosocial 
battery that in cludes: a) self -report measures of satisfaction with physical appearance, anxiety 
and depressive symptoms, social functioning and social avoidance and distress and; b) questionnaires that assess significant predictors of quality of life outcomes from post -trauma 
craniofacial surgery: perceived social support, self -esteem, copi[INVESTIGATOR_499576]- surgical 
expectations of/post -surgical outcomes. A research technician experienced in psychosocial 
interviewing with patients (DM) will meet with each patient during the baseline evaluation to administer the self -report battery of psychosocial questionnaires. A comprehensive battery of 
tests for evaluation of quality of life has been assembled for this study. It is important to properly 
determine the impact of the sur gical changes and the investigators have selected Psychosocial 
assessment instruments to evaluate four domains: a) Satisfaction with appearance/surgical 
outcomes: The Satisfaction with Appearance (SWAP) scale is a [ADDRESS_643199] reliability that measures both subjective and social–behavioral 
aspects of body image and has been used in populations with significant physical disfigurements 
or deformities. b) Satisfaction with Medical/Health Services -  Patient Satisfaction with Health 
Services – the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ -8) (38) is a widely used brief inventory of 
satisfaction with services (amount of help, kind of help, availability of help) provided by a medical service or program. This 8- item self -report questionnaire will be administered at each of 
the post -surgery visits.c) Social Distress, Depression and Avoidance: Social Distress and 
Avoidance -  Individuals with facial disfigurement can suffer extreme anxiety and avoidance in 
interp ersonal interactions. The Social Anxiety and Distress (SAD) Scale (40) is a widely used 
measure of social avoidance and distress that has shown to be sensitive to pre -/post - surgical 
improvement in recent studies of patients undergoing reconstructive surge ry for significant 
physical deformity. Anxiety and Depressive Symptomatology will be monitored using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -Brief) (41) and the PCL -S (Brief) (42), a self -report questionnaire 
that taps PTSD symptoms for use among individua ls. Self -esteem will be assessed by [CONTACT_499629] (SES)(43), a brief (10- item), self -report inventory has been

outcome research with self -rated indices of health, quality of life, energy, role limitations due to 
physical problems or emotional problems, and functionality in everyday physical, emotional, and social function domains.

peripheral stick performed by [CONTACT_268906] 5th floor of the UPMC MUH building to include CBC with Differential,Platlets Comprehensive Chemistry panel, and PT/ PTT/ INR. If t he subject is a female of child bearing potential, we will obtain a urine pregnancy 
dip test. If the test result is positive the subject will not continue participation in this research study. Electrocardiogram (EKG) Chest X -ray as indicated by [CONTACT_499631]/or 
physician discretion A coordinator note will be completed summarizing the study visit and placed 
into the subject's chart. The total time duration for subject participation for this visit is estimated 
to be approximately 3 -4 hours i n length. FAT GRAFT Surgical Procedure: For the purpose of 
this study the fat grafting procedure is a research procedure. It is very important to note that this 
research procedure is not an experimental procedure. Fat grafting is a minimally invasive cl inical 
procedure that has been widely used by [CONTACT_499632]. Fat grafting is known as a filler providing an accurate means to restoring facial soft tissue structure. The fat grafting procedure will occur at  UPMC Magee or Montefiore Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_499581]. On the day of the surgical procedure, prior to entering the operating room, the Investigator physician will mark the subject's facial area(s) intended for fat grafting procedure. 2D pi[INVESTIGATOR_499582] o btained for research purposes at this time. With the fat graft procedure the subject 
will be given general anesthesia, a medicine that will relax and assist to in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_499583] (in a sleep like state) during the entire procedure. Once unconscious, the plastic surgeon, using small narrow tube -like instruments called cannulas, will remove fat from various 
places throughout the body (commonly the abdomen and thighs). The processing of the fat graft material is done using a Tefla non -adheren t gauze pad in a rolling technique that separates the 
aqueous and oil layers from the injected component. The plastic surgeon will then use the Coleman cannulas (specialized smaller cannulas with varied shapes and tip sizes specifically made to deliver sma ller amounts of fat) to fill the desired area. The facial areas which are known 
to have tight spaces with varying angles and can have scarring bands (scar tissue) makes the 
Coleman cannula appropriate for this type of fat delivery. The Coleman Cannula Syst em is also 
associated with less graft re- absorption than other techniques. The Coleman Cannula System is 
not experimental and is commercially available in the [LOCATION_002] and in compliance with 
Federal regulations. During the Fat grafting reconstructiv e surgery the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] /or Co- investigator 
will obtain a portion of the fat (lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]) up to 80ccs specimen will be collected as a research 
sample. If the subject refuses to give consent for this sample, the subjects will not be able to 
participate in th e clinical trial. The sample will remain under the oversight of Kacey Marra, PhD, 
Co-Investigator examined for cellular information in the Plastic surgery lab located on the 16th 
floor of the Biomedical Science Tower, University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]. The samples will be de -
identified, labeled with the subject's study ID number. Once the surgical procedure has been 
completed the subject will go to the recovery room where he /she will be monitored until stable 
enough to be released to home. There might be a possibility that the subject would be admitted to 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_499584]. The following 
lab process will take place in the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_499585]:Up to 
80cc of the lipoa spi[INVESTIGATOR_499586]. The specimen will be 
digested in balanced salt solution containing 1 mg/ml collagenase and 3.5% fatty acid free BSA in a 37°C shaking water bath until fragments are no longer visible and digest has a m ilky 
appearance. Digests are filtered and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes. Floating adipocytes 
are removed and the remaining digests are treated with an erythrocyte lysis buffer. Plating media 
will be changed every two days until confluence (~4 days  to reach 90% confluence). 1x106 
adiposed- derived stem cells/patient will be stored at - 80°C. Remaining cells will be utilized in the 
experiments below. We have been successfully culturing human preadipocytes in our laboratory 
for the past 7 years.[1- 12]Preadipocyte yield: The number of cells isolated per gram of adipose 
tissue will be determined using a hemacytometer. Comparison of isolated cells from gentle centrifugation of lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_268826] 200 rpm for 3 minutes to adipose -derived stem cells will be 
determined. Preadipocyte Viability: Cell viability will be determined using the Live/Dead assay. 
The live cells will be stained with fluorescein diacetate (FDA, Green) and dead cell nuclei will be stained with propi[INVESTIGATOR_268827] (PI, Red). Preadipocyte Proli feration: Cellular proliferation of 
preadipocytes will be assessed with the CyQUANT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 48 and 96 hours. Media will be changed every 48 hours.Preadipocyte Differentiation: To assess the potential of the preadipocytes to differentiate into the adipogenic cell type within the HA gels, cells will be treated plating media containing 0.2 nM dexamethasone, 0.5 uM insulin, 0.2 nM triiodothyronine, antibiotics, and 540 uM IBMX in 
addition to their current med ia. To confirm adipogenesis, lipid inclusions cells will be confirmed 
by [CONTACT_268904] -O. Additionally, protein expression of PPAR and FABP4 will be 
determined using western blot analysis, and RNA expression of these adipogenic markers will be 
determined using PCR.Preadipocyte characterization. We will characterize preadipocytes from 
each patient for stem cell surface antigens using flow cytometry. Passage zero preadipocytes isolated (as described above) from the abdominal subcutaneous tissue wil l be divided into 
aliquots of 5x105 cells and stained with selected monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against progenitor cell surface markers. The antibodies include mAbs against CD34, CD45, CD90, CD133, CD105 and CD166. Rationale for these surface markers incl udes the following: 1) these 
markers are routinely examined for bone marrow stem cell markers, and have also been examined as adiposed -derived stem cells markers,[13] and 2) we will be able to discern stem cell 
purity by [CONTACT_268905]. The cell s will be incubated with mAbs for 30 min at 4 ?C, 
and washed in PBS. At least 100,000 viable cells based on 7AAD( -) staining in each sample will 
be acquired and analyzed using a FACSAria fluorescence- activated cell sorter (Becton -
Dickinson).The samples w ill remain at University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]'s Adipose Stem Cell under the 
oversight of Kacey Marra, PhD, Co- Investigator, on the 16th floor of the Biomedical Science

*  Addressed below:     
 
Serial computed tomography imaging will be performed to assess the total soft tissue volume 
before fat grafting and afterwards at three time points: immediately post- grafting, three months 
post-graft and nine month post -graft. Comparisons of the post -graft  tissue volume to pre -treatment 
volume will be performed using a paired t -test model. Repeated measures analysis of variance 
will be used to evaluate change over time in all outcome measures. Using standard conventions of 
alpha=0.05 and beta=0.8, an enroll ment of ten patients will provide sufficient power to detect a 
clinically meaningful differences in the volume of soft tissue between groups.. Based on published effect sizes for clinically significant medical outcomes on the SF -36 (i.e., 0.5 to 0.7), 
e.g., following surgery for dentofacial deformities (d = 0.6) (64), and medium (0.5 – 0.79) to large 
(0.8 to > 3.0) effect sizes on SF -36 social functioning outcomes of neck surgery (65) and 
orthopedic surgery (66), it is expected that a sample of [ADDRESS_643213] size (d = 0.5) on SF -[ADDRESS_643214] conventions of alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.8. The cotton rolling fat processing technique takes place in  the Operative Room during the study surgery directly following the 
collection of the lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. Outcome of facial appearance and soft tissue volume in subjects who were injected with fat grating material processed by [CONTACT_499635]09060101 who were injected with fat grafting material using the centrifuged technique. Significance level (adjusted for sidedness) 
=.025, standard deviation = 15 (15%), number of patients = 10, power= .0.8, difference in means 
= undefined, location of mean in one group as a percentile of the other group = undefined. The variable calculated was the minimum detectable difference. The probability is [ADDRESS_643215] a treatment d ifference at a two -sided 0.05 significance level, if the true 
difference between the treatments is 19.881 units or 19.8%. This is based on the assumption that the standard deviation of the response variable is 15 units or a 15% inter -individual coefficient  of

3.12 Provide a statistical justification for the total number of subjects to be enrolled into this 
research study at the multicenter sites or this site. *  Described below:  Serial computed 
tomography imaging will be performed to assess the total soft tissue volume before fat grafting and afterwards at three time points: immediatel y post -grafting, three months post -graft and nine 
month post -graft. Comparisons of the post -graft tissue volume to pre -treatment volume will be 
performed using a paired t -test model. Repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to 
evaluate change ov er time in all outcome measures. Using standard conventions of alpha=0.05 
and beta=0.8, an enrollment of ten patients will provide sufficient power to detect a clinically meaningful differences in the volume of soft tissue between groups.. Based on publi shed effect 
sizes for clinically significant medical outcomes on the SF -36 (i.e., 0.5 to 0.7), e.g., following 
surgery for dentofacial deformities (d = 0.6) (64), and medium (0.5 – 0.79) to large (0.8 to > 3.0) effect sizes on SF -36 social functioning outc omes of neck surgery (65) and orthopedic surgery 
(66), it is expected that a sample of [ADDRESS_643228] size (d = 0.5) on SF -[ADDRESS_643229] 
convent ions of alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.8. Outcome of facial appearance and soft tissue volume 
in subjects in this protocol will be compared to those subjects in PRO09060101. Significance level (adjusted for sidedness) =.025, standard deviation = 15 (15%), num ber of patients = 10, 
power= .0.8, difference in means = undefined, location of mean in one group as a percentile of the other group = undefined. The variable calculated was the minimum detectable difference. The probability is [ADDRESS_643230] a treatment difference at a two -sided 0.05 
significance level, if the true difference between the treatments is 19.881 units or 19.8%. This is based on the assumption that the standard deviation of the response variable is 15 units or a 15% 
inter-individual coefficient of variation.

Common Risks:  No Value Entered   
Infrequent Risks:  No Value Entered   
Other Risks:  Experimental Interventions: Some anesthetic medicines may cause allergic or other abnormal 
reactions in some people, but these are rare. If you suspect you may have such a problem, 
you should tell both your surgeon and anesthesia specialist well before your surgery. Testing 
will then be arranged as necessary. A rare, potentially fatal condition called malignant 
hyperthermia (MH) may be triggered by [CONTACT_499642]. The anesthetics most commonly 
associated with malignant hyperthermia include the inhalation anesthetics and the muscle 
relaxant medicines.

Common Risks:  Experimental Interventions: It is common (Occurs in 10 -25% of people (10 to 25 out of 100 
people) that you may experience irritation or redness at the sites where small adhesive disks are placed on the chest skin to hold the wires that are hooked to the computer that measures

Other Risks:  No Value Entered   
 
 
View  Research Activity:  Surgical Anesthesia   
Common Risks:  Experimental Interventions: Although all types of anesthesia involve some risk, major side 
effects and complications from anesthesia are uncommon. Your specific risks depend on your health, the type of anesthesia used, and your response to anesthesia. Some people who are 
going to have general anesthesia express concern that they will not be completely unconscious but will "wake up" and have some awareness during the surgical procedure. 
Awareness during general anesthesia is very rare because anesthesia spec ialists devote 
careful attention and use many methods to prevent this.   
Infrequent Risks:  Experimental Interventions: Infrequent Risks: General anesthesia suppresses the normal 
throat reflexes that prevent aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], such as swallowing, coughing, or ga gging. To help 
prevent aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], an endotracheal (ET) tube may be inserted during general anesthesia. When an ET tube is in place, the lungs are protected so stomach contents cannot enter the 
lungs. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_499602]. To reduce this risk, 
people are usually instructed not to eat or drink anything for a specific number of hours 
before anesthesia so that the stomach is empty. Anesthesia specialists use many safety 
measures to minimize the risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Insertion or removal of airways may cause 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_268850]; gagging; or muscle spasms in the voice box, or larynx (laryngospasm), or in the bronchial tubes in the lungs (bronchospasm). Insertion of 
airways also may cause an increase in blood pr essure (hypertension) and heart rate 
(tachycardia). Other complications may include damage to teeth and lips, swelling in the 
larynx, sore throat, and hoarseness caused by [CONTACT_268933].   
Other Risks:  Experimental Interventions: Oth er serious risks of General anesthesia: These include changes 
in blood pressure or heart rate or rhythm, heart attack, or stroke. Death or serious illness or 
injury due solely to anesthesia is rare and is usually also related to complications from the 
surgery. Death occurs in about [ADDRESS_643249] side effects of general anesthesia are minor and can be easily managed.   
 
 
View  Research Activity:  Surgical Fat Grafting procedure   
Common Risks:  Experimental Interventions: Change in appearance: Typi[INVESTIGATOR_499603]'s volume over time and then becomes stable. It is possible that more treatments maybe 
needed to maintain the desired volume of the transferred fat and resulting appearance. Less 
commonly, if you experience significant weight gain, the transferred fat may increase in 
volume and cause an undesirable appearance. Skin Contour: While most transferred fat 
results in a natural feel, it is possible that some or all of the fat may become firm, hard or 
lumpy. If some of the fat does not survive the t ransfer it may result in fat necrosis (fat tissue 
death) caussing firmness and discomfort and pain. Cysts may also form at the site of the transferred fat. Asymmetry: symmetrical body appearance may not result from a fat graft 
procedure. Factors such as sk in tone, fatting deposits, boney prominences, and muscle tone 
may contribute to normal asymmetry in body features. Pain: Chronic pain may occur rarely 
after fat removal or graft.   
Infrequent Risks:  Experimental Interventions: Bleeding: It is possible, t hough unusal to experience a bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_268847]. Should bleeding occur, it may require emergency treatment to drain accumulated blood (hematoma). Seroma: Although unlikely, a collection 
of fluid may appear at the site where the fat was removed. This is usually treated by [CONTACT_499643] a needle. Infection: Infection is unusual after this procedure should infection 
occur additional treatment including antibiotics or surgery may be necessary. Tissue Loss: In 
rare cases, t he grafted fat may cause the skin over the transferred area to be injured resulting 
in loss of the skin and surrounding tissue. This may leave scars and disfigurement. Damage 
to deeper structures: Deeper structures such as nerves, blood vessels and muscles  may be 
damaged during the course of this procedure. The potential for this to occur varies according 
to where on the body the procedure is being performed. The injury to deeper structures may 
be temporary or permanent. serous complications may include blood clots, partial collapse of 
lungs, pulmonary embolism, fat embolism, stroke, infection, blindness loss of vision, and/or 
death.   
Other Risks:  Experimental Interventions: Scarring: All invasive procedures produce scars, some more 
visible than others. a lthough good wound healing after a procedure is expected, abnormal 
scars may occur both within the skin and within the deeper tissues. Scars may be unattractive 
and of different color than the surrounding skin. There is the possibility of visible marks from 
sutures used to close the wound. Scars may also limit motion and function. Additional 
treatment including surgery may be needed to treat scarring. Long term effect: subsequent 
changes in the shape or appearance of the area were the fat was removed or pla ced may occur 
as a result of aging, weight loss or gain, or other circumstances not related to the Fat grafting 
procedure. Unsatisfactory result: There is a possibility of unsatisfactory result from the 
procedure resulting in unacceptable visible deformiti es, loss of function, wound disruption, 
skin death and loss of sensation. Allergic reaction: In rare cases local allergies to tape, suture material, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_499604]. Systemic reactions, which are more 
serious, may result from dru gs used during the procedure.

View: Clinical Trials Registration  
    
ClinicalTrials.gov is a registry and results database of publicly and privately supported clinical 
studies of human participants conducted around the world.  
"Applicable clinical trials " are required by [CONTACT_499657].gov .  
Applicable Clinical Trials (ACTs) are studies that meet the following criteria: 
• The study is an interventional study AND    
• The study intervention is a drug, biologic, medical device, radiation or genetic AND  
• The Study is not Phase 0 or 1 AND  
• The study has at least one site in the [LOCATION_002] or is conducted under an investigational new 
drug applica tion or investigational device exemption  
NIH Policy  
Effective January 18, 2017, revised NIH  Policy requires that all clinical trials  funded in whole or in part 
by [CONTACT_114115].gov.   
As defined b y the NIH, a clinical trial  is: 
A research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include pl acebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions 
on health related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.  
The NIH Policy extends beyond the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act (FDAAA 801) requirements in that it requires registra tion and results reporting of:  
• clinical trials of behavioral, surgical and other types of health and medical interventions  
• phase 1 studies of drugs and biological products    
• small feasibility studies of device products  
Failure to submit all required registration and results information requested on ClinicalTrials.gov can 
jeopardize University grant funding, the future funding of the grantee and subject the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_114085].  
In addition, to promote transparency of the c linical trials process, the 
International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)  has established a policy requiring the entry of clinical trials in a public  
registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov,  prior to subject enrollment as a condition of consideration for 
publication of the trial results.

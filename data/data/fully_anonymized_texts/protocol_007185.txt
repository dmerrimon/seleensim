Brief Description of Study Purpose:  This data -driven study is being conducted for hypothesis generation in 
population of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients using advanced applicati ons for magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) developed by [CONTACT_1034], GE Healthcare (GEHC), and corresponding clinical neuropsychological 
assessments. This data is intended for future use in development of  specialized MR acquisition, reconstruction , 
and proce ssing software intended to identify mTBI biomarkers.  
Summary of Study Procedures:  
Clinical Site Procedures : Two parallel subject segments will be enrolled, including (1) mTBI patients with recent 
injury in Segment 1 and (2) subjects without recent TBI injury of similar age and demographic characteristics 
(non -TBI controls  in Segment 2 ). Baseline health information, demographics, and medical history (including prior 
TBI injury) will be collected for both segments . 
Subjects will attend up to four sequenti al visits relative to injury date (mTBI subjects) or first study scan date 
(controls): Visit 1 = ≤72 hr, Visit 2 = 7±2 days, Visit 3 = 14±2 days, and Visit 4 = 90±7 days . The mTBI s ubjects  
(Segment 1)  may start at Visit 1 or Visit 2.  Each visit  will includ e a clinical neuropsychological assessment battery 
and MR scan with GE Research Pack II  (including research sequences and clinically useful T1, T2, Flair, and 
reconstructed SWI and DTI ) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_779] . 
Laboratory Procedures : Clinically acqui red MR data (DICOM, P -files, and auxiliary files) will be transferred to an 
imaging laboratory for GE Research Pack II  reconstruction of clinically useful views using multiband technology 
and study post -processing. Post -processed data and evaluations (as i ndicated on a per -module basis by [CONTACT_429]) will be collected.

Number of Subjects:  Data will be collected for two groups  (segments)  of subjects : (1) mTBI subjects  in Segment 
1; and ( 2) non-mTBI controls  in Segment [ADDRESS_909744] 105 complete datasets from control subjects.  Accounting for all possible reasons, 
attrition is estimated at 40%. Thus, a maximum of 350 mTBI subjects and 175 non -TBI controls may be enr olled  
across all sites . While it is expected that sites should enroll approximately equal numbers of subjects, if possible, 
all sites are encouraged to accrue eligible mTBI subjects as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_673187]. Thus, it is prospectively expected that per -site accrual 
may vary based on actual enrollment rates . 
Additionally, up to 10 vol unteers without mTBI injury and not requiring urgent medical care ( Segment 0 volunteer 
subjects ) may be enrolled per-site for training  and retraining purposes on study devices . 
Each site should enroll app roximately half as many control subjects  as mTBI s ubjects that complete two 
consecutive visits  and thus provide two consecutive data points (complete either Visits 1 and 2, or Visit 2 and 3), 
e.g., one control may be enrolled for every two mTBI subjects. A report of mTBI subject enrollment will be 
generated by [CONTACT_673221] (CRO) and provided to the  site on a 
monthly basis (30±7 days). The report will categorically detail the number of mTBI subjects completing at least 2 
visits based on (in order of priority) gender, age, handedness, highest educational level, and MR system used (if 
more than one sys tem used at the site) as detailed in Section 5.1.1.  Enrollment of non -mTBI controls . 
Controls are required to attend Visits 1 and 4, but may also attend Visit 2 and 3 when available. Per site, c ontrols 
should be  enrolled in a manner that achieves the same overall ratio within each characteristic category  as the 
mTBI population that has completed two visits to date (per site, all mTBI patients enrolled from study start to 
date of monthly summary analysis) , with th e priority detailed in Table 2 of this protocol.

1. PRELIMINARY INVESTIG ATIONS AND  JUSTIFICATION  
1.1. Literature Review  
Over 1.1 million traumatic brain injuries (TBI)  occur  in [LOCATION_002]  emergency departments 
annually , including 50,000 fatalitie s and 43.4% chronic disability. 1 Up to  31.6% of the global 
population will experience TBI during their lifetime. 1 , 2 In particular, mild  TBI (mTBI)  occurs in about  
100-300 of 100,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -treated TBI cases, though actual occurrence in the general population 
is expected to be above 600/100,000 , though many may fail to seek treatment despi [INVESTIGATOR_673188] -term effects . 3 Cases of mTBI are particularly common in the  military , sports, and among 
motorcyclists and bicyclists, posing a major public health concern worldwide . 4 Thus improved 
diagnostic and prognostic methods are necessary.   
Historically, mTBI has been treated as an “event” perceived to have little or no lasting effect on 
central nervous and organ systems. [ADDRESS_909745] of mTBI  has 
based on recent reports of unexpectedly prolonged injury and subsequent identification of cerebral  
biomarkers  and anatomical abnormalities  has fostered awareness of mTBI , particularly in 
professional sports and the military . 6, 7 Currently, TBI injuries are commonly categorized by [CONTACT_673223], moderate, or severe based on the length of loss of consciousness (LOC), alteration of 
consciousness (AOC), or post -traumatic amnesia (PTA) . [ADDRESS_909746]  different cognitive symptoms and white matter 
injury at different time points relative to injury, potentially indicating compensatory mechanisms or 
plasticity in response to injury. 9, 10  
Comprehensive characterization of mTBI pathophysiology  using modern technolog ies, such as 
contemporary advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  systems  can provide  precise 
information on brain injury magnitude and location . Unlike computed tomography systems, which 
are less costly but have limited usefulness in m TBI due to  relatively low sensitivity to diffuse brain 
damage , MRI can detect  characteristics of regional brain ab normalities  necessary for diagnostic and 
prognostic decision -making . [ADDRESS_909747] progression of mTBI. 
This exploratory study is conducted to aid in identifying corr elations between mTBI imaging and 
symptoms  that can help to improve advanced MRI applications for brain injury developed by [CONTACT_429], GE Healthcare.

         Version Date: 14/Nov/[ADDRESS_909748] been developed for 
assessing concussion immediately following military injury (“blast concussion assessments”) and 
immediately following injury in sports (“sideline concussion assessments”). Different organiza tions, 
however, have reached very different conclusions on which tool is optimal, and no universal 
consensus on the optimal tool has been reached.  A comprehensive review by [CONTACT_673224] 13 
(2012) compared self -report concussion scales/checklists from 290 original articles published 
between 1995 and 2008 identified over 20 tools commonly cited in mTBI literature, and a number 
of additional commercial tools that are now available. Notably, Mc Leod and Leach 13 also report 
that very few of these tool s were created in a systematic manner that follows scale development 
processes and published psychometric properties.  
Efforts to standardize tool s for clinical diagnosis and management  of mTBI  include  the Military 
Acute Concussion Evaluation (MACE) and US Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6490.[ADDRESS_909749] widely 
used standardized tools for mTBI assessment is the  National Institutes of Health (NIH)  National 
Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Common Data Elements (CDE) , a set of 
multipl e domain  assessments for  collection of clinical and imaging information  from diverse TBI 
patients . [ADDRESS_909750] set of CDEs was developed in 2010 and was well-suited for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based 
studies of acute TBI in adults. To broaden the utility of the TBI CDEs, experts were asked to update 
the recommendations to make them relevant to all ages, injury severity, and phases of recovery. 
The second version of the TBI CDEs (v.2) were developed in 2012  and were organized based on four 
major study types of epi[INVESTIGATOR_7306] : acute  injury , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] , studies of the 
rehabilitation for moderate/severe TBI , and mild TBI/concussion research. Many of the CDEs will 
overlap across study types, which allows  for comparisons and meta -analysis across studies. This 
consistency also allows for continuity across disease areas , enabling in crease d efficiency and 
effectiveness of clinical research studies and clinical treatment, increasing data quality, facilitating 
data sharing, and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_673189]. 15 
1.3. Pre-Clinical Trials and Previous Clinical (human) Experience  
This study design is informed by [CONTACT_673225] -NFL Head Health Initiative in 2014 -2015 (GEHC Sponsored study Nos. 114 -
2013 -GES-0017; 114 -2014 -GES-0001, and 114 -2014 -GES-0046; GEHC Internal MWS DOC1461400, 
DOC1499099, and DOC1564473). Prior trials suggest  that MR information derived from diffusion 
(specifically kurtosis measures), fM RI, arterial spin labeling (ASL), volumetry, and other measures 
may correlate with  cognitive assessments and biomarkers of mTBI severity and progression . In 
addition, outcomes of the TRACK -TBI Multicenter Initiative sponsored by [CONTACT_673226] (NINDS No. RC2NS069409) and the NCAA -DoD Grand Al liance 
joint venture sponsored by [CONTACT_2315] (DOD) and National Collegiate Athletic 
Association (NCAA) support the growing interest and body of knowledge regarding clinical use of 
mTBI MRI applications. 16, 17

modules (volumetry, Kurtosis, RS fMRI, RSI, and, as applicable, further advanced modules) 
executable on VolumeShare 5 Advantage Workstations (AW) . Acquisition includes  pulse sequence s 
and corresponding interface software to define radio frequency (RF), gradient pulses , and 
associated parameters to optimally shape  gradient waveforms  when used in conjunction w ith head  
coils . Echo time  as well as  imaging parameters for contrast and other characteristics  have been 
enhanced for optimal results in mTBI based on commercially available MR sequences, including  a 
variety of advanced modules like  functional MRI (fMRI), transit time mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (TT mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), 
enhanced arterial spin labeling (eASL), 3D -enhanced T2* weighted angiography (eSWAN),  and fluid 
attenuated inversion recovery  (FLAIR),  as well as  specialized T1 and T2  sequences . To maintain and 
calibrate systems  and for training , routine MR accessories such as MR imaging phantoms , may be 
used in this study. 18, 19  
2.1.2.  32-channel Multiband MR Brain Coil 
The 3 2-channel multiband MR brain  coils are designed to speed up scan time with parallel imaging. 
GE Research Pack II  is optimized for the 32-channel MR brain coil for GE 3.0T (Nova Medical , 
Wilmington, [LOCATION_005], [LOCATION_003]). [ADDRESS_909751] acceleration rates , and similar construction as conventional coils . Other commercially available  
MR coils may be used during this study in cases where the  participant  cannot be scanned with the 
research coil , as described in the study procedure . 
2.1.3.  Discovery MR750 3.0T/Discovery MR750w 3.0T MR scanners  
Discovery MR750 3.0T/Discovery MR750w 3.0T MR scanners are whole -body magnetic resonance 
scanners indicated for d iagnostic imaging , spectroscopic imaging , parametric map pi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , and/or 
spectra, dynamic imaging  of body structures/ functions, including head and neck . Per site practice, 
routine a ccessory/ ancillary devices may be used, i.e. padding, hearing protection, communication, 
and safety devices. DV24 or current software  will be used.  
2.1.4.  VolumeShare 5 Advantage Workstation (AW)  
Post -processing is completed on a VolumeShare 5 Advantage Workstation (AW) , which supports 
image display, manip ulation, reconstruction, post -processing, and selective recording and is 
intended to be used to create and review diagnostic evidence related to radiology procedures by

2.2. Regulato ry Status  
Discovery MR750  3.0T  and/or Discovery MR750w  3.0T  scanners , VolumeShare 5 Advantage 
Workstation (AW), MR phantoms, and conventional MR accessory  and ancillary devices used in this 
study , including conventional MR coils,  are commercial devices cleared by [CONTACT_48354] (FDA). These devices are not indicated specifically for mTBI use and may be used in 
combination with investigational devices and components as part of this study, and are thus 
treated as investigational devices f or research purposes.   
GE Research Pack II , including its acquisition and software (multiband reconstruction and post -
processing components ), and the 32-channel multi -band MR brain coil for GE 3.0T (Nova Medical)  
are investigational MRI system components that are  not currently cleared by [CONTACT_55257].  
2.2.1.  Device Classification and Rationale  
Discovery MR750 3.0T and/or Discovery MR750w 3.0T scanners are considered Class II magnetic 
resonance diagnostic device per 21 CFR §892.1000. MR Coils are  considered to be C lass II  
components of a magnetic resonance diagnostic device , per 21 CFR §892.1000. The  VolumeShare 5 
workstation is considered to be a Class II Pi[INVESTIGATOR_185784] 21 CFR 
§892.2050.  
2.3. Device Risk Analysis  
Eligible subjects will b e required to satisfy site MR safety screening requirements and  will then 
undergo  MR scanning with the  GE Research Pack II  executed on commercial MR systems using  the 
research 32 -channel MR brain coil  (or alternative commercial coil, in the event that that  head size, 
medical conditions, deformities, anxiety, or other medical issues prevent use of the research coil) . 
The investigational software and MR coil are  optimized for technical performance and have similar  
safety profiles to those found in routine MRI  imaging use in clinical settings.  All scanning will be 
conducted using static field strengths of 3.0T or less . To mitigate risk to levels as low as reasonably 
practicable  (ALARP), the study will employ  MR safety methods in accordance with the  2013 ACR

3. OBJECTIVES OF RESEAR CH STUD Y 
3.1. Study Objectives  
3.1.1.  Primary Objective  
This data -driven study is being conducted for hypothesis generation in  population of  mTBI patients 
using  advanced application s for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) being developed by [CONTACT_429], GE Healthcare (GEHC) , and corresponding clinical neuropsychological assessments . 
Acquired  data are intended f or future use in development of specialized MR acquisition, 
reconstruction , and processing software  intended  to identify  biomarkers of mild traumatic brain 
injury (mTBI).  
3.1.2.  Safety Objective:  
Type, incidence, severity, and relatedness to device of adverse events (AEs) will be recorded during 
active study participation, from when subject enters the MR scanning area until leavin g the 
scanning area at each visit (not followed between visits).  
3.2. Study Endpoints  
3.2.1.  Primary Endpoint  
Per-subject, per -visit collection of data elements from clinical sites (as detailed in Appendix E –Data 
Collection by [CONTACT_467378] ), including:  
1) GE Research Pack II  MR image data (DICOM, P -files, and auxiliary files)  
2) Clinical neuropsychological assessment battery results  
3.2.2.  Safety Endpoint:  
Type, incidence, severity, and relatedness to device of adverse events (AEs)  
4. DESIGN OF RESEA RCH STUDY  
4.1. Research Study Design and Rationale  
This is a n open -label, non -randomized, prospective, multi -site, parallel group  (segment) , 
hypothesis -generating  study designed to collect data that will aid in future scientific and 
engineering exploration of correlations between clinical neuropsychological assessments and GE 
Research Pack II  advanced MR imaging in  mTBI patients. The results are primarily intended for 
scientific inquiry and engineering development purposes, and may be used in future regulatory 
submissions.  
Hypothesis -generating studies are designed to provide preliminary data for discovering  possible 
leads worthy of further research study. [ADDRESS_909752] of 
clinical research, the quality of such studies depends crucially on using informed “building blocks” 
of hypothesis -generating studies that generate pi[INVESTIGATOR_673192]. 24 Hypothesis -generating 
studies are essential precursors to the development of future hypothesis -testing studies. 24 A

4.3. Controls and Minimization of Bias  
Consecutive  eligible  mTBI  subject s will be enrolled  until the target enrollment is reached in order  to 
minimize sele ction bias . The control population will be enrolled with characteristics that closely 
resemble those  of the mTBI population, as defined by [CONTACT_673229]-date on a monthly basis. Because the population is intentionally  
broad  in this hypothesis -generating study to encompass a wide cross -section of the general clinical 
mTBI population , there may be confounders for testing specific correlates, which should be 
considered in study results.

Data will be collected for two groups  (segments)  of subjects : (1) mTBI subjects  in Segment 1  and (2) 
non-mTBI controls  in Segment [ADDRESS_909755] 105 c omplete datasets from control subjects. Accounting for all 
possible reasons, attrition is estimated at 40%. Thus, a maximum of 350 mTBI subjects and 175 
non-TBI controls may be enrolled.  
While it is expected that sites should enroll approximately equal num bers of subjects, if possible, all 
sites are encouraged to accrue eligible mTBI subjects as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_673193]. Thus, it is prospectively expected that 
some sites may hav e differing final accrual.

5.1.1.  Enrollment of non -mTBI controls  
Enrollment Rate: Each site should enroll approximately half as many control subjects as mTBI 
subjects , at a rate of approximately one control enrollment for each two mTBI subjects that 
complete at least two visits (1:2). Though it is prospectively expected that actual enrollment rates 
may vary, it is the investigator’s responsibility to maintain this approxim ate rate in order to 
minimize possible bias due to variance in scanner performance (“scanner drift”) and ot her possible  
confounders . 
 
Population Matching: The study aims to achieve overall matched mTBI and control populations 
across sites. The overall population will be matched for characteristics identified in order of priority 
in Table 2. To enable sites to select control subjects that match the overall po pulation, a report of 
mTBI subject enrollment will be generated by [CONTACT_673230] (CRO) and provided to the site on a rolling monthly basis. The report will categorically 
detail the number of enrolled mTBI subje cts with the following characteristics (Table 2). The clinical 
site, under the supervision of the Principal Investigator, will be ultimately responsible for ensuring 
that matched controls are selected according to these criteria.  
 
Case -Control Matchin g: When possible, investigators are also encouraged to enroll individual ly 
matched mTBI and control cases of potential medical interest. Priority should be given, however, to 
ensuring an appropriate overall population match.

The population s under study are mTBI patient s (Segment 1)  and non -TBI controls (Segment 2). The 
mTBI patients will be diagnosed mTBI based on site practice and the American Congress of 
Rehabilitation  (ACRM) Definition of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury  (1993 ), 27 and the certainty of 
diagnosis will be recorded. Volunteers for training purposes (S egment 0) and non -TBI controls 
(Segment 2)  will also be enrolled . It is well accepted that while some training can be done using 
simulations (phantoms), the complexity of in vivo  human cerebral tissues cannot be fully duplicated 
without the use of living v olunteers. 28 Thus, volunteer subjects will be used for essential activities 
of training/retraining study staff on clinical functionality.  
5.3. Protection of Vulnerable Subject s 
Eligible st udy staff , site employees, students, or fellows may volunteer  to participate , in accordance 
with local EC/IRB policies . Investigators and study staff should ensure that no volunteer is under  
undue influence or coercion to participate , and the  decision to volunteer or no t will not affect 
educational, employment, or staff assignment status.  
Adolescent subjects aged 15 but less than 18 may be asked to participate as mTBI patients or 
controls (Segments 1 and 2). Minor subject may not  volunteer for training (Segment 0) . This 
research does not involve greater than minimal risk to children as subject s (45 CFR §46.404 and 21 
CFR §50.51). Written parental consent and assent to participate is required for minors, in  
accordance with 45 CFR §46.408  and applicable IRB policy .

6.  PROCEDURES FOR RESEA RCH STUDY  
6.1. Quality Procedures  
6.1.1.  Rationale and Background for Quality Procedures  
Minute variations or changes in scanner performance can influence the a bility of MRI to 
produce distinguishable characteristics in the brains of mTBI patients. Contemporary studies 
indicate that use of multiple MRI scanning devices of similar static field strength are acceptable 
for pooling and have low variance, supporting t he feasibility of pooling multi -site MRI data 
effectively. 29, 30, [ADDRESS_909760] quantitative performance data from MRI 
scanners to verify the reproducibility and variance between scanners critical to future analysis of 
the mTBI data collected in this study. The Sponsor will provide training on pro per execution of 
quality procedures.

6.2. Volunteer ( Segment 0)  Procedures  
6.2.1.  Scan Procedures  
Volunteer MR scan sessions are expected to last approximately 90 min  (no more than 120 
minutes)  with an optional break after 60 minutes of scanning. Study staff should en sure that 
volunteers continue to meet the criteria for MR safety at the site immediately prior to MRI 
scanning. Volunteers will be provided with  clothing safe f or MRI (such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548509]), 
hearing protection, and protective devices , per the site’s standard of care for MRI scanning.  
Subjects will be told how to communicate with the operator during scanning, and scanning may 
be stopped at any time if the subject reports discomfort.  Volunteer scans may use any 
combination of study hardware and software  necessary for training/retraining purposes, 
including GE Research Pack II  acquisition software and conventional MR sequences on the 
device, research and conventional MR coils, and/or other MR accessory/ancillary devices.  
6.2.2.  Participation in Multiple Scan Ses sions  
Subjects enrolled in Segment 0 may participate in one or more MR scan session during the study 
if the following criteria are met:  
1. Volunteer subjects may be scanned once per [ADDRESS_909761] -
processing using this data; however, in the event of technic al or safety issues data may be 
shared with the Sponsor for evaluation as part of this research data . The site will maintain a log 
of volunteer scans  (Appendix A – Segment 0 Volunteer Scan Log ). Logs may b e disclosed and 
evaluated by [CONTACT_673235], and to determine if the 
site requires additional training.

Subsequent Visits  – Missed or Incomplete Visits : For all subsequent visits , subjects may remain 
on study if a visit is  missed or incomplete  for any reason , at the  investigator’s  discretion  (else 
the subject may be withdrawn) . The site will note the reason for any missed or incomplete visits 
for subjects that remain on study, and these incomplete data set s will not considered a 
deviation . It is ultimately the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that data is maximally 
complete, as incomplete case data may impair scientific integrity of the study.  
 
Subsequent Visits – Missed Visit Window (Table 2):  If a subject failed to complete a visit within 
the visit window, he/she may still be eligible to complete future visits as scheduled (Table 2). 
Except in exceptional circumstances, study procedures should not be conducted  outside of the 
visit windows (Tab le 2). Any part of a study visit  conducted outside of the protocol visit wind ows 
should be reported as a deviation.  
 
Lost to Follow -Up: If a subject is not able to be contact[CONTACT_673236] (Table 2), the 
subject will be withdrawn from study and co nsidered lost to follow -up. The site should make 
reasonable attempts  to contact [CONTACT_673237]. Subjects lost to follow -up are not considered in 
deviation of the  protocol if documentation of reasonable attempt to contact [CONTACT_673238].  
 
Withdrawal:  Withdrawals should be documented as per Section 6.5. -Withdrawal and 
Discontinuation Criteria . Once a subject is withdrawn, he/she is no longer eligible to participate 
in any future study visits or procedures, but the data collected up until the time of withdrawal 
may still be used and disclosed as part  of this research.  
6.3.3.  Baseline Data Collection  
After the subject is determined eligible according to the inclusion/exclusion and has provided 
informed consent (and assent for minors), the following will be recorded for each subject : 
• General Medical H istory and Demographic Information  
• Prior mTBI Information : Current ( for mTBI subjects ) or prior TBI information (for all control 
and mTBI subjects ), if available for the subject (it is prospectively expected that not all data 
may be available for each subj ect): 
o prior medical records  
o relevant laboratory reports  
o neuroimaging (including CT, MRI, or other scans)  
o baseline neuropsychological or cognitive assessments done for sports or 
occupational purposes (such as SCAT2/3 for sports players), which may be 
reques ted from prior care providers and collected as part of study data.  
• Baseline Clinical Information  about the injury  (must be collected within visit window ): 
o injury presentation  information

         Version Date: 14/Nov/2016  
 
o health assessments (such as vital signs)  collected during the visit  
o Certainty  of Diagnosis  for mTBI patients in Segment 1  (assessed on a 3-point ordinal 
scale ). Eligible subjects  are required to meet diagnostic criteria for mTBI at the site. 
In addition, a qualified physician or clinical psychologist  on the study staff wil l assess 
certainty of diagnosis based on : 
1  =   Certain mTBI Diagnosis : Presents with a combination  of physical, 
behavioral/emotional, and/or cognitive symptoms (not pre -existing) where 
recent head injury  is strongly expected to play the central  causal role . 
2  =   Probable mTBI Diagnosis : Presents with at least one  physical, 
behavioral/emotional, and/or cognitive symptoms (not pre -existing) where 
recent head injury can be reasonably expected to play a causal role . 
3  =   Possible mTBI Diagnosis : Presents with at least one physical, 
behavioral/emotional, and/or cognitive symptoms (not pre -existing) where it 
is uncertain whether or not recent head injury play s a causal role  (as in the 
case where symptoms assessment is complicated by [CONTACT_673239] s or 
diagnoses  pre-existing mTBI, such as mood disorders, physical disability, or 
other chronic conditions or medication use).  
Baseline will be considered the day of the first study scan for all subjects , and Baseline Data  will 
be inclusive of information collected or requested based on the first visit ( General Medical and 
demographic information , and prior mTBI information ) and information collected at the  first visit 
(Baseline Clinical Information ). Only Baseline Clinical Information  is required to be col lected and 
reported within the visit window. Other information, such as medical history and prior records, 
may be updated in the subject record as it becomes available to the site.  
6.3.4.  Visit Procedures  (Clinical Neuropsychological Assessment and MR Scan)  
Each visit will consist of a Clinical Neuropsychological Assessment of symptoms self -report, 
cognitive behavioral scales, and physical testing  (lasting approximately 60 minutes)  and an MR 
scan session  using GE Research Pack II  acquisition software  (lasting approximately 60 minutes) . 
The MR scan should be completed within the interval 24 hours before or after the Clinical 
Neuropsychological Assessment (within 4 hours, when possible). The example listing of data 
collection to be performed at each vis it is shown in Appendix E – Data Collection by [CONTACT_61134] . 
For MR scanning, study staff should ensure that the subject meets the criteria for MR safety at 
the site immediately prior to MRI scanning. Subjects will be prov ided with clothing safe for MRI 
(such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548509]), hearing protection, and protective devices, per the site’s standard of 
care for MRI scanning. Subjects will be told how to communicate with the operator during 
scanning, and scanning may be stopped at any time if the subject reports discomfort.  
All scans will be completed using  32-channel multiband research coil, except in in cases where 
the 32 -channel  multiband  research coil cannot be used due to: (1) head size, (2) medical 
conditions, (3) deformit ies, (4) anxiety, or (5) other medical issues. Alternatively,  any 
commercially available  32-channel MR coil available at the site may be used, and its applicable 
identifiers (i.e. make, model, etc.)  will be recorded.

6.3.5.  MR Acquisition Data  (Clinical Site Procedure)  
For each  scan session, the scan operator or designee will record parameters  as described in the 
MR Data (Appendix E – Data Collection by [CONTACT_61134] ) to a Sponsor provided case report form 
(CRF) . DICOM, P -files, and auxiliary files  (collected according to the instructions provided by [CONTACT_429]) will be recorded for each visit. This data will be transferred to the Sponsor or its 
identified contract research organization (CRO) for  execution of th e GE Research Pack II  
software . 
6.3.6.  MR Acquisition Image Reads /Evaluations  (Clinical Site Procedure)  
One or more site  radiologist will read the clinically useful sequences acquired from GE Research 
Pack II . For reading, the clinically useful image set includes  both the images produced routinely 
from the clinical interface ( T1, T2 , and Flair ) and images that require reconstruction by [CONTACT_673240].  
Readers will assess the entire clinically useful image set (T1, T2, and Flair an d reconstructed SWI 
and DTI)  according to the NINDS CDE Tool: Imaging  with additional Sponsor -provided elements 
(if necessary) added for research purposes . The reader will determine whether each case is 
normal or abnormal and complete the Sponsor -provided case report form (CRF)  for each case . 
Readers are not required to be blinded to clinical care . Readers will have access to 
reconstructions necessary to  review  the full clinically useful  image set ( including conventional 
reconstructions available from the c linical interface and reconstructions of SWI and DTI  
produced by [CONTACT_673241], which are not able to be produced on the clinical 
interface due to use of the investigational multiband technology). Readers will be blinded to 
other results  of post -processing with GE Research Pack II . 
6.4. MR Data Post -Processing  (Imaging Laboratory Procedure)  
Data from Segments 1 and 2  will be transferred to an imaging laboratory (Sponsor or contracted 
CRO) independent of the clinical care facility for GE Research Pack II data post -processing. GE 
Research Pack II acquisition  data collected at clinical sites will be screened for quality and loaded 
onto a workstation for execution of the GE Research Pack II  post -processing  modules . 
Authorized study staff ( such as technician , imaging scientist,  and/or  radiologist ) will record post -
processing outcomes  as detailed in Appendix D – Detail of Post -Processing Assessment Modules . 
During the course of the study, the Sponsor may provide technical optimizations to post -
processing modules, which will be recorded in the device accountability log. The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_673195] i n post -processing 
technology using the form shown in Appendix D. Clinical site s may be asked to  resolve issues of 
data quality or missing data  identified by [CONTACT_673242] . 
6.4.1.  Incidental Findings  
MR imaging in this study is conducted usin g investigational MR sequences for research 
purposes . The  investigational research sequences are  not intended to provide diagnostic 
information ; however, GE Research Pack II  also contains components that may be useful as 
reference  for the patient’s clinica l care  (including clinically useful T1, T2, Flair, and reconstructed

SWI and DTI  MR data) . Patient management should not be based solely on data acquired from 
research sequences. The other research MR i mages and related data generated as part of study 
procedures are not intended for use in patient management decisions or to be stored in patient 
medical records . In the event that a member of the study staff identifies something  possibly 
abnormal  in a rese arch MR image that may be of medical significance, they shall notify the 
principal investigator . The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_673196], if necessary according to his/her medical judgment , communicati ng 
findings to  the patient and/or his or her regular physician, in accordance with IRB policy.   
6.5. Withdrawal and Discontinuation Criteri a 
A subject  may withdraw from study at any time, for any reason without consequence. The 
Investigator  may withdraw a subject at any time for any reason , including some clinical 
conditions concurrent enrollment in another interventional research study that could confound 
results or pose risks to the patient,  or use any medication, stimulant, or illicit substance that 
could in terfere  with safe study conduct or integrity of research data, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_160507].  In the event that a subject experiences an additional TBI injury during the 
study period or sustains other significant injury that could interfere with study participation or 
outcomes, the subject should be withdrawn when the investigator becomes aware of the 
change in the subject’s medical status. In cases where the investigator is unsure if an injury 
would disqualify the subject, the case should be  confirmed with the Sponsor’s medical monitor . 
The reasons for withdrawal and discontinuation for any subject  shall be recorded , when known . 
These will be reported to the Sponsor . The EC/IRB should be notified per their notificatio n of 
subject  withdrawal policy.  All data collected up until the time of subject  withdrawal or 
discontinuation may be used in study analyses , may be used in any and all subsequent 
subanalyses determined necessary by [CONTACT_1034],  and will be stored by [CONTACT_673243] . 
Note : For each subject’s  first visit, the subject  must complete their MR scan and neurological 
assessment per-protocol  (baseline and prior medical history data may be collected at any time 
after enrollment ). Thereafter, s ubjects  that miss a visit  or attend a visit outside of the scheduled 
window  should not be withdrawn, and may  continue in the study. Missing a visit or visit window, 
however, will be considered a protocol deviation and reported in accordance with Section 9.1. - 
Management of Protocol Deviations . 
7. TRAINING PLAN  
Training plan documents and logs of training attendance will be stored in the Sponsor’s clinical 
history file (CHF).  
7.1. Training Plan for Research Device  
The Sponsor will provide training on the research device and any device optimizations or 
versions released during the study. The Investigator may request that additional training be

9. DEVIATIONS  
9.1. Management of Protocol Deviations  
Deviations to the protocol may occur when necessary to protect the life or physical well-being  of 
a subject . Except in an emergency, prior approval by [CONTACT_673245] , or 
planned deviations from this protocol. If these changes affect the scientific soundness or the 
safety and welfare of the subject , prior  EC/IRB  approval is also required. Planned Protocol 
Deviation documentation must be filed in the Site Study Regulator y Binder.  
There are two types of unplanned protocol deviations, critical deviations and non -critical 
deviations. All deviations must be documented and reported, the criticality of the deviation wil l 
determine the reporting path.

10. COMPLAINT HANDLING AND  ADVERSE EVENT REPOR TING  
10.1. Foreseeable Adverse Events and Device Effects  
MRI does not use ionizing radiation (high -energy radiation that can potentially cause damage to 
DNA, such as those found in X -rays and CT scans).  MRI of 8.0T or less is widely considered non -
significant risk for adults and adolescents, in accordance with the limits defined in the US FDA 
document Criteria for Significant Risk Investigations of Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices 
(June 20, 2014). The safety profile of 3.0T MR scanning is well characterized,  and adverse events 
are expected to occur  at frequencies equivalent or less than conventional MRI using 
commercially -released scanners (adverse events are expected to occur in less than 1 in 100,00 0 
patients; P < 10-5). 21 Foreseeable adverse events of 3.0T MRI scanning  of the head  in this study 
may include  the following : 
• During any MRI scan, the use of strong magnet s may cause pacemakers, arti ficial limbs, 
and other implanted medical devices that contain metal to malfunction or heat up 
during the exam.  Subjects are screened against site MR safety standards to mitigate 
these risks.  
• During any MRI scan, any  loose metal object s may cause damage or  injury if it gets 
pulled toward the magnet.  Subjects are screened for ferrous metallic objects before 
entering the scan area to minimize these risks.  
• Dyes from tattoos or tattooed eyeliner can cause skin or eye irritation , and subjects may 
be asked to rem ove make -up for this reason.  
• Medication patches can cause a skin burn , and subjects may be asked to remove these 
or other attached medical devices before scanning for this reason.  
• The wire leads used to monitor an electrocardiogram (ECG) trace or respi[INVESTIGATOR_673197] a 
scan must be placed carefully to avoid causing a skin burn , and subjects may be asked to 
remove these or other attached medical devices before because of this.

Page 31 of 74 DOC1689463  (Rev. 4.0) 
         Version Date: 14/Nov/2016  
 
• Prolonged exposure to radio waves during the scan could lead to slight warming of the 
body.  Patients will be monitored for signs of discomfort throughout scanning to mitigate 
these risks.  
• Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_673198], under certain conditions, cause nerves close to 
the skin to become stimulated.  This is known as Peripheral Nerv e Stimulation (PNS).  
Patients will be monitored for signs of discomfort throughout scanning to mitigate these 
risks.  
• Transient hearing loss or tinnitus can be caused by [CONTACT_673246] [ADDRESS_909768] ion will be used during scanning to 
minimize acoustic noise levels.  
• Feelings of anxiety triggered by [CONTACT_673247].  Patients will be monitored for signs of discomfort 
throughout scanning to mitigate these risks.  
The occurrence of these risks it mitigated to levels as low as reasonably practicable  (ALARP) in 
accordance with the 2013 ACR Guidance Document on MR Safe Practices (J. Magn. Reson. 
Imaging 2013;37:501 –530), 21 within includes MR safety screening and hearing protection 
guidelines to minimize acoustic noise levels during scanning.  
Because subjects are having a neurological assessment that includes physical and cognitive 
tests, t here are some risks to subjects completing these assessments. These include physical or 
mental stress, fatigue, minor to moderate injury risk associated with physical tests (such falls or 
abrasions during balance tests, in rare cases), and confidentiality risks  due to disclosure of 
personal information (e.g. sociodemographics, health, and occupational status information) . The 
risks associated with these tests are not expected to exceed those encountered during routine 
examinations of head injury.  
10.2. Adverse Ev ent Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE) : As defined by [CONTACT_148096] [ZIP_CODE] -2011: any untoward medical occurrence, 
unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) 
in subject s, users or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) : As defined by [CONTACT_148096] [ZIP_CODE] – 2011: an adverse event that  
(a) led to death;  
(b) led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject , that either resulted in : 
(1) a life-threatening illness or injury, or 
(2) a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 
(3) in-subject  or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  
(4) medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to bod y structure or a body function;  
(c) led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
Anticipated : Any adverse event and/or reaction, the specificity or severity of which is consistent 
with the IRB approved informed cons ent, protocol, investigator brochure, or product labeling.  
Unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) : As defined by 21 CFR §812.3: means any serious 
adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or

         Version Date: 14/Nov/[ADDRESS_909769], problem, or death was not previously identified in 
nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem as sociated with 
a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subject s. 
10.3. Management of Adverse Event Reporting  
Any adverse events will be recorded in the subject s study record and the Adverse Event Case 
Report Form. Subjects will be followed for adverse events and device effects from the time they 
arrive for each study visit (immediately after providing informed consent for the first visit, and 
upon arriving to the study area for each subsequent visit, until the subje ct leaves the study area 
after each visit). The following information should be obtained:  
▪ Description of Event  
▪ Date of onset and resolution  
▪ Intensity (mild, moderate, severe)  
­ Mild : Symptom(s) barely noticeable to the subject  or does not make the subject  
uncomfortable. The AE does not influence performance or functioning. Prescription 
drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s).  
­ Moderate : Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make the subject  uncomfortable. 
Performance of daily activities is  influenced. Treatment of symptom(s) may be needed.  
­ Severe : Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to cause the subject  severe discomfort. 
Treatment for symptom(s) may be given.  
▪ Serious (yes/no)  
▪ Relationship to device ( unrelated, possibly related, probably r elated)  
­ Unrelated : The adverse event is reasonably expected to be related to (or caused by) a 
concurrent illness, effect of another device/drug or other cause, and is unlikely related 
to the investigational product  
­ Possibly related : The adverse event is re asonably expected to be related to the 
investigational product, and an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to 
the potential relationship to investigational product  
­ Probably related : There is a strong relationship to investigational prod uct, or recurs on 
re-challenge, and another etiology is unlikely, or there is no other reasonable medical 
explanation for the event.  
▪ Treatment given and/or action taken (procedure stopped, wit hdrawn from study, no action)  
▪ Anticipated (yes/no)  
Adverse event s will be reported to the local  EC/IRB  per their policy.  
10.4. Management of Serious Adverse Event and Unanticipated Adverse Device

APPENDIX F – AMENDMENT TO PROTOCO L VERSION 1.0  TO 2.0  
Purpose : This amendment document describes the changes from protocol version 1.0 to 2.0,  as follows:  
1. To remove a non -participating site (University of Michigan).  
2. To remove the MR phantom daily and monthly sub -studies. Notably, MR phantoms may still be used in 
routine training and calibration for the study, as originally described in the proto col version 1.0, to ensure 
quality; however, no systematic data collection will be performed for this data.  
3. To clarify language in Appendix E regarding description and identify of cognitive and symptoms 
assessments.  
The following amendments were made to version 1.0 to produce version 2.0. Point -by-point revisions are shown as 
additions in double -underline ( double -underline ) and deletions in strikethrough ( strikethrough ) for each change 
made in this amendment for the previous version.

Research Pack II 
Advanced MRI 
Application Suite  GE Research Pack II  is an advanced MRI application suite developed 
by [CONTACT_1034], GE Healthcare (GEHC), co nsisting of acquisition 
software executable on Discovery MR750 3.0T/Discovery MR750w 
3.0T MR scanners and a comprehensive set of post -processing 
modules (volumetry, Kurtosis, RS fMRI, RSI, and, as applicable, 
further advanced modules) executable on VolumeS hare 5 Advantage 
Workstations (AW). Acquisition includes  pulse sequences and 
corresponding interface software to define radio frequency (RF), 
gradient pulses, and associated parameters to optimally shape 
gradient waveforms when used in conjunction with hea d coils. Echo 
time as well as imaging parameters for contrast and other 
characteristics have been enhanced for optimal results in mTBI based 
on commercially available MR sequences, including a variety of 
advanced modules like functional MRI (fMRI), transit  time mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
(TT mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), enhanced arterial spin labeling (eASL), 3D -enhanced 
T2* weighted angiography (eSWAN), and fluid attenuated inversion 
recovery (FLAIR), as well as specialized T1 and T2 sequences. To 
maintain and calibrate systems and for trainin g, routine MR 
accessories such as MR imaging phantoms, may be used in this study. 
18, 19  Clarified that MR 
phantoms may still be 
used in routine 
training and 
calibration for the 
study, as originally 
described in the 
protocol version 1.0, 
to ensure quality ; 
however, no 
systematic data 
collection will be 
performed for this

Phantoms  2.1.3 MR Imaging Phantoms  
MR Quality Imaging Phantom Models (Quantitative Diffusion 
Phantom 19 and Quantitative System Phantom 20; High Precision 
Device, Inc., Boulder, CO, [LOCATION_003]) are modeled after the human head 
imaging characteristics. The Quantitative Diffusion Phantom consists 
of a sphere containing small areas of varied contrast agents designed 
for quantitative standardization, includin g recording of the apparent 
diffusion coefficient (ADC). The Quantitative System Phantom is a 
plastic sphere containing vials of varied polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone 
(PVP) aqueous solutions for standardization of isotropic diffusion in 
H2O, designed for mea suring B 1 uniformity, B 0 uniformity, geometric 
linearity, gradient amplitude, slice profile, slice positioning accuracy, 
landmark accuracy, system center frequency drift (short time 
duration), resolution, s ignal -to-noise ratio ( SNR), and 
accuracy/precision  of T1 and T2 measurements.  
 Removed reference to

Phantom Model scans ( Quantitative System Phantom  and, if 
determined necessary by [CONTACT_1034], Quantitative Diffusion 
Phantom , as described in Section 3.1.3 MR Imaging Phantoms ) at 
least once per month (at intervals of 30±5 days). Monthly phantom 
scans will be completed in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
instructions and, if necessary, additional scanning instructions 
provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
For each phantom scan performed as part of the quality procedure, 
study staff will record the DICOM output and provide results to the 
Sponsor for regular technical processing and review. Additional MR 
imaging phantom scanning may be conducted at any time during the 
study (except during a clinical scan of a human subject), at the 
discretion of the investigator. If the investigator observes any issues 
that he or she suspects could interfere with the intended function or 
performance of the device, the Sponsor should be informed.  
6.1.2 fMRI Quality Assurance (QA) Tool (daily procedure)  
fMRI is inherently sensitive to minor and expected variations in local 
systems that do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_673216]. In order to 
ensure the integrity of fMRI data, at the start of each day of study 
scanning, prior to the first scan of a human subject the fMRI Quality 
Assurance (QA) tool should be executed on each scanner used in the 
study. This procedure is conducted with no human in  the bore. 
Completion of the fMRI QA procedure should be logged in the fMRI 
QA Completion Log, as shown in Appendix B – fMRI QA Completion 
Log. Removed the

22 Section 5.1.1. Enrollment 
of non -mTBI controls  Enrollment Rate: Each si te should enroll approximately half as many 
control subjects as mTBI subjects , at a rate of approximately one 
control enrollment for each two mTBI subjects that complete at least 
two visits (1:2). Though it is prospectively expected that actual 
enrollment rates may vary, it is the investigator’s responsibility to 
maintain this approximate rate in order to minimize possible bias 
due to variance in scanner performance (“scanner drift”) and other 
possible confounders.  
 that complete two consecutive visits and thus provide two 
consecutive data points (complete either Visits 1 and 2, or Visit 3 and 
4), e.g., one control may be enrolled for every two mTBI subjects.  
Population Matching: The study aims to achieve overall ma tched 
mTBI and control populations across sites. The overall population will 
be matched for characteristics identified in order of priority in Table 
2. To enable sites to select control subjects that match the overall 
population, a report of mTBI subject e nrollment will be generated by 
[CONTACT_673221] (CRO) 
and provided to the site on a rolling monthly basis. The report will 
categorically detail the number of enrolled mTBI subjects with the 
following characteristi cs (Table 2). The clinical site, under the 
supervision of the Principal Investigator, will be ultimately 
responsible for ensuring that matched controls are selected 
according to these criteria.  
 
Case -Control Matching:  When possible, investigators are also 
encouraged to enroll individually matched mTBI and control cases of 
potential medical interest. Priority should be given, however, to 
ensuring an appropriate overall population match.  
 
Overall Population Reports : A report of mTBI subject enrollment will 
be generated by [CONTACT_673230] (CRO) and provided to the site on a monthly basis (30±7 
days). The report will categorically detail the number of mTBI 
subjects with the following characteristic characteristics (Tab le 2).

(non -mTBI controls) are required to complete their initial MRI scan 
and clinical neurological assessment within 24 hours (in either order), 
and are required to satisfy complete all parts of the visit within the 
visit window as defined in Tabl e 2 (with the exception of requests for 
medical history and other historical information, which may be 
requested and added to the subject record at any time during the 
study, as data becomes available to the investigators). Any subject 
that is not able to complete all parts of the first visit within the visit 
window should be withdrawn from study once this becomes known. 
No additional information will be collected after the time of 
withdrawal, but information collected up until this point may be used 
and di sclosed. Withdrawal due to inability to complete a visit is not 
considered a deviation if the subject is immediately removed from 
study (withdrawn) and no additional information is collected.  
 
Subsequent Visits – Missed or Incomplete Visits:  For all subseq uent 
visits, subjects may remain on study if a visit is missed or incomplete 
for any reason, at the investigator’s discretion (else the subject may 
be withdrawn). The site will note the reason for any missed or 
incomplete visits for subjects that remain on  study, and these 
incomplete data sets will not considered a deviation. It is ultimately Added clarifying

Subsequent Vi sits – Missed Visit Window (Table 2):  If a subject 
failed to complete a visit within the visit window, he/she may still be 
eligible to complete future visits as scheduled (Table 2). Except in 
exceptional circumstances, study procedures should not be 
conduc ted outside of the visit windows (Table 2). Any part of a study 
visit conducted outside of the protocol visit windows should be 
reported as a deviation.  
 
Lost to Follow -Up: If a subject is not able to be contact[CONTACT_673266] (Table 2), the subjec t will be withdrawn from study

and/or cognitive symptoms (not pre -existing) 
where recent head injury can be reasonably 
expected to play a causal role.  
6  =   Possible mTBI Diagnosis : Presents with at least 
one physical, behavioral/emotional, and/or 
cognitive symptom s (not pre -existing) where it 
is uncertain whether or not recent head injury 
plays a causal role (as in the case where 
symptoms assessment is complicated by [CONTACT_673269] -existing mTBI, 
such as mood disorders, physical disability, or 
other chronic conditions or medication use).  
information will be recorded  
. For subjects with current mTBI or prior TBI injury, prior medical 
records, neuroimaging (including CT, MRI, or other scans), and 
available baseline neuropsychological or cognitive as sessments done 
for sports or occupations purposes (such as SCAT2/3 for sports 
players) may be requested from prior care providers and collected as 
part of study data.  
Baseline will be considered the day of the first study scan for all 
subjects ., and Basel ine Data  will be inclusive of information collected 
or requested based on the first visit ( General Medical and 
demographic information , and prior mTBI information ) and 
information collected at the first visit ( Baseline Clinical Information ). 
Only Baseline Clinical Information  is required to be collected and 
reported within the visit window. Other information, such as medical 
history and prior records, may be updated in the subject record as it 
becomes available to the site.

28 Section 6.3.4. Visit 
Procedures (Clinical 
Neuropsychological 
Assessment and MR 
Scan)  Each visit will consist of a Clinical Neuropsychological Assessment of 
symptoms self -report, cognitive behavioral scales, and physical 
testing  (lasting approximately 60 minutes) and an MR scan session 
using GE Research Pack II  acquisition software (lasting approximately 
60 minutes). The MR scan should be completed within the interval 24 
hours of before or after the Clinical Neuropsychological Assessment 
(within 4 hours, when possible). The example listing of dat a 
collection to be performed at each visit is shown in Appendix E – 
Data Collection by [CONTACT_61134] . 
For MR scanning, study staff should ensure that the subject meets 
the criteria for MR safety at the site immediately prio r to MRI 
scanning. Subjects will be provided with clothing safe for MRI (such 
as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548509]), hearing protection, and protective devices, per 
the site’s standard of care for MRI scanning. Subjects will be told how 
to communicate with the operator durin g scanning, and scanning 
may be stopped at any time if the subject reports discomfort.  
All scans will be completed using 32 -channel multiband research coil, 
except in in cases where the 32 -channel  multiband  research coil 
cannot be used due to: (1) head si ze, (2) medical conditions, (3) 
deformities, (4) anxiety, or (5) other medical issues. Alternatively, 
any commercially available 32 -channel MR coil available at the site 
may be used, and its applicable identifiers (i.e. make, model, etc.) will 
be recorded.  
 Terminology updates, 
for consistency with 
prior sections.  
29 Section 6.3.5. MR 
Acquisition Data (Clinical 
Site Procedure)  For each scan session, the scan operator or designee will record 
parameters as described in the MR Data ( Appendix E – Data 
Collection by [CONTACT_61134] ) to a Sponsor provided case report form 
(CRF). DICOM, P -files, and auxiliary files (collected according to the 
instructions provided by [CONTACT_1034]) will be recorded for each visit. 
This data will be transferred to the Sponsor or its identified contract 
research organization (CRO) for execution of the GE Research Pack II  
software  (including multiband reconstruction for SWI and DTI and 
study post -processing) . 
 While SWI and DTI are 
clinically useful, this is 
removed to correct 
misinterpretation that 
these a re linked with 
multiband technology.  
30 Section 6.3.6. MR 
Acquisition Image 
Reads/Evaluations 
(Clinical Site Procedure)  One or more site radiologist will read the clinically useful sequences 
from acquired from GE Research Pack II . For reading, the clinica lly 
useful image set includes both the images produced routinely from 
the clinical interface (  (T1, T2, and Flair , ) SWAN and images that 
require reconstruction by [CONTACT_673270] (SWI and DTI ).  
Readers will assess the entir e clinically useful image set (T1, T2, and 
Flair and reconstructed SWI and DTI)  MR acquisitions  according to 
the NINDS CDE Tool: Imaging  with additional Sponsor -provided 
elements (if necessary) added for research purposes , . The reader 
will determine wheth er each case is normal or abnormal and 
complete the Sponsor -provided case report form (CRF) for each case.  Clarifies which

31 Section 6.4.1. Incidental 
Findings  MR imaging in this study is conducted using investigational MR 
sequences for research purposes. The investigational research 
sequences are not intended to provide diagnostic information; 
however, GE Research Pack II  also contains components that may be 
useful as reference for the patient’s clinical care (including clinically 
useful T1, T2, Flair, and reconstructed SWI and DTI  SWAN MR data  
conducted during research scan sessions ). Patient management 
should not be based solely on data acquired from research 
sequences. The other research MR images and related data 
generated as part of study procedures are not intended for use in 
patient management decisions or to be stored in patient medical 
records. In the event that a member of the study staff identifies 
some thing possibly abnormal in a research MR image that may be of 
medical significance, they shall notify the principal investigator. The

Foreseeable Adverse 
Events and Device Effects  Because subjects are having a neurological assessment that includes 
physical and cognitive tests, there are some risks to subjects 
completing these assessments. These include physic al or mental 
stress, fatigue, minor to moderate injury risk associated with physical 
tests (such falls or abrasions during balance tests, in rare cases), and 
confidentiality risks due to disclosure of personal information (e.g. 
sociodemographics, health, a nd occupational status information).

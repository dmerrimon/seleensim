Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  1. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
Parkinson’s disease ( PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder ; its clinical 
diagnosis is based on the presence of
 a core set of neurological symptoms including rest tremor, 
bradykinesia, rigidity, and disturbances of balance and posture. Patients also experience a 
number of nonmotor symptoms that are equally important to address. These include psychosis and behavioral disturbances, pain, sensory complaints, depression, and dementia ( Weintraub and 
Stern, 2005;  Aarsland et al., 1999). Among these, perhaps the most significant with respect to 
morbidity and quality of life, and the most difficult to treat, is psychosis. Psychotic symptoms occur in 20% to 40% of patients with PD in advanced stages of the disease ( Marsh, 2005; 
Fenelon, 2000 ). Parkinson’s disease psychosis (PDP) manifests primarily as hallucinations and 
delusions ; initial symptoms are frequently a sense of presence or passage.  
 Development of psychosis in a patient with PD i
s progressive and often devastating as it is 
prognostic of nursing home placement, poses enormous stress on caregivers, and markedly 
increases the risk of mortality in the patient population (Chou and Fernandez, 2006; Factor et al., 
2003). There is no proven safe and effective course of treatment for PDP. Dose reduction of 
dopaminergic treatment is frequently standard practice when psychoti c symptoms first present, 
but this practice does not always diminish psychosis and provides only short- term antipsychotic 
benefit. In addition, it usually results in increased motor function deficits.   There are six atypi[INVESTIGATOR_640850] i n the [LOCATION_002] ( U.S.): aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], 
clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], risperidone, and ziprasidone.  None of these agents are approved for the treatment of PDP.  Nevertheless, off- label use of these agents is sometimes 
employed.  The most commonly u sed for PDP are clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_146584]. Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_640851]. However, the prescribing community is often reluctant to employ clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_53530] a first line therapy in the PDP population because of ( 1) the risk of agranulocytosis, (2) the stringent, associated monitoring requirements, 
and (3) other potential idiosyncratic reactions such as myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_640852]. In two 
blinded and placebo-controlled trials, quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_640853] ( Ondo et al., 2005, and Rabey et al., 2006) . 
Risperidone and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_640854]. More recently, two case studies suggest that ziprasidone may be useful in treating PDP, however, the cardiovascular safety profile and potential effects on motor function may limit its use. The available data on aripi[INVESTIGATOR_640855], because it may cause mo tor worsening.  
 In addition to the risk of motor effects associated with the other atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709], sedation is a serious side effect in this population, which increases risks of falls and fractures. This patient population is already at risk given the tendency for frequent somnolence and sleep attacks to occur during the day. In addition, a black box warning was recently applied to the label of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_640856]. The Food and Drug

Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Administration (FDA) determined in 2005 that the treatment of behavioral disorders in elderly 
patients with dementia with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_640857]. Of a total of 17 placebo -controlled trials performed with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], 
risperidone, or quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_640858], 15 showed higher mortality in the drug -treated arm compared with the placebo -treated arm  (FDA Public 
Health Advisory issued 11 April 2005). Moreover, a retrospective cohort study, reported that typi[INVESTIGATOR_640859] (Wang et al., 2005), suggesting the dopamine D
2 receptor  subtype (D 2) rather 
than the serotonin 2A recep tor (5HT 2A) may be involved in the increased mortality. 
 
1.1 Investigational Drug 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256]  (pi[INVESTIGATOR_149641], or ACP -103) is the tartrate salt of the active moiety N-(4-
fluorophenylmethyl)- N-(1-methylpi[INVESTIGATOR_66808] -4-yl)- N’-(4-(2-
methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl)carbamide (2 R,3R)-dihydroxybutanedioate (2:1) and is a novel 
small molecule designed to specifically block serotoninergic neurotransmission mediated by [CONTACT_941] 5HT
2A receptor. At higher doses pi[INVESTIGATOR_640860] 5HT 2C receptors . 
 Although the etiology of PDP is unclear, both scientific and clinical observations support the use of a 5HT
2A receptor inverse agonist, such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256], in this indication (Weiner et al., 
2003). Furthermore, pi[INVESTIGATOR_640861] D [ADDRESS_857649] been 
implicated in a range of dose- limiting side effects of the existing antipsychotic drugs as well as 
an increased risk of mortality in elderly patients with dementia (Wang, et al., 2005). On the basis of its novel receptor binding profile, pim avanserin  may be effective in PDP and have an 
improved safety profile relative to other antipsychotic agents.  
1.2 Previous Clinical Experience  
 ACADIA has initiated 17  clinical  trials of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256].   Fifteen  of these studies are completed 
and 2 studies are ongoing (Stud y ACP -103-010 and Study ACP-103-015).  Of the [ADDRESS_857650] been analyzed; analy sis is ongoing for the other study (ACP-103-014).  The [ADDRESS_857651] had exposure to pi[INVESTIGATOR_640862]. Of these subjects, 447 were PD/PDP 
patients, 258 were healthy volunteers  and 177 were schizophrenic patients.   In a long- term, open-
label safety trial in PD P patients (Study ACP -103-010), [ADDRESS_857652] received pi[INVESTIGATOR_640863] > 12 months, including 13 subjects treated for ≥ 24 months and 2 subjects treated for > [ADDRESS_857653], 2010, both those subjects remain active. 
 In the other long-term, open- label safety trial in PDP subjects (ACP -103-015), [ADDRESS_857654] 
received pi[INVESTIGATOR_149647] > [ADDRESS_857655] received pi[INVESTIGATOR_149647] > [ADDRESS_857656] their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable local 
regulatory requirements.

Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.   
Across study populations (healthy volunteers as well as patients), pi[INVESTIGATOR_640864] [ADDRESS_857657] common adverse events ( AEs) were similar in healthy normal volunteers, PD 
patients, and schizophrenia patients and occurred at a similar frequency between pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] - 
and placebo -treated subjects. The majority of AEs reported in studies to date we re considered 
mild to moderate in nature.   Central nervous system and gastrointestinal disturbances were the most common AEs. Central nervous system events included headache, postural dizziness, somnolence (drowsiness), and dizziness. G astrointestinal disturbances included nausea, constipation, dyspepsia, and vomiting; 
severe nausea and vomiting occurred and were dose- limiting in a few cases. Other reported, but 
less common, AEs included psychiatric conditions such as confusion and hallucinations. Cardiac-related and cardiovascular AEs were infrequent and included ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, and vasovagal and syncopal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Other infrequent AEs included orthostatic hypotension, asthenia, fatigue, peripheral edema, and injury especially due to a fall.

once daily according to the previously described schedule (see Table 1).  The subject should 
make every attempt to take the investigational product in the morning. 
5.3 Concomi
tant Therapy  
Concomitant medications should be kept to a minimum during the study.  The Investigator  
should use such medications in accordance with accepted clinical practice and only medications essential for  subjects’ well-being while enrolled in the study should be administered at the 
Investigator’s discretion. If such medication is deemed essential, subjects should stay on their usual medication regimens at stable doses during the entire course of the study if possible. A suitable alternative may be used if the drug is on the prohibited list, based on having a consultation with the Medical Monitor prior to such a decision. 
Any trea
tment given, other than the investigational drug, is to be considered a concomitant 
medication. The dosage, time and reason for taking the concomitant medication should be noted in the eCRF and medical notes for all subjects. 
As state
d above, the Investigator should examine the acceptability of all concomitant therapy not 
explicitly prohibited in this protocol. In order to assure that appropriate concomitant therapy is administered, it is essential that subjects be instructed not to take any medication (either self -
administered non-prescription drugs or prescription therapy prescribed by [CONTACT_20427]) without prior consultation with the Investigator. Accordingly, each subject will be instructed to refrain from drinking alcoholic beverages in excess , and using illicit drugs . Use of other drugs 
including any herbal or over -the- counter preparations should be discussed with Investigator.

subjects at the Week [ADDRESS_857676] withdraws or is terminated from the 
study, at an End -of-Study visit.   
 
Blood pressure (BP), including systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), will be measured in the same arm at each visit by [CONTACT_2329] a manual or automated sphygmomanometer. The results will  
be recorded in millimeters of mercury (mmHg ) on the appropriate CRF pages. Pulse rate will be 
measured in the radial artery in the dominant arm for 30 seconds and will be recorded as beats per minute (bpm). Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR) will be measured and recorded in breaths/minute. Oral temperature will be measured using a digital thermometer.  
 Each time vital signs are measured the following procedures for orthostatic BP and pulse rate evaluation should be followed:  After the subject is supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044] [ADDRESS_857677] will then be instructed to rise to a standing position. BP and pulse rate will be again 
measured 1  minute after standing.  
 Potentially clinically significant orthostatic findings include:  
 
 SBP drop of 20 mmHg or more 
 DBP drop of 15 mmHg or more

[IP_ADDRESS]. Sample Collection and Bioanalytical Processing 
Venous blood samples for clinical laboratory tests will be collected via venipuncture into 
appropriate blood collection vacuum tubes. A central laboratory will analyz e all clinical 
laboratory test samples. Blood samples for clinical laboratory tests should be collected and processed according to the SOP of the central laboratory.  
 Blood samples for pharmacokinetic ( PK) anal
 ysis will be sent to the central laboratory fo r 
storage and will be forwarded to for PK analysis.  Detailed collection and handling 
instr
uctions will be provided in the study laboratory manual.  The date of PK blood collection 
must be recorded in the subject’s CRF. Each label will state the stu dy number, subject number, 
analyte (plasma), and study day of sample.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical
ly Important Abnormalities  
The following general procedure will be used to determine whether the investigational drug has 
clinically important effects on evaluated parameters : 
 
 Each subject with values of potential clinical importance should receive appropriate medical evaluation. To accomplish this, the Investigator and the Medical Monitor will each review every subject’s complete laboratory, vital signs and ECG data, all AE records, and any other pertinent sections of the CRF. All correspondence related to each subject will be documented. 
 

ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 29 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_857680] result reports should be signed and 
dated by [CONTACT_640902](s) for confirmation. Any significant laboratory abnormalities that are either serious or unexpected should be promptly reported to the Medical Monitor. The diagnosis associa ted with any clinically significant laboratory abnormality will be recorded as an 
AE on the CRF. If feasible, the AE should be recorded as the underlying abnormality or diagnosis (e.g., renal insufficiency) as opposed to the observed deviation in the labor atory result 
(e.g., elevated creatinine). Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology of an abnormal result, or to monitor the course of an AE, may be obtained when clinically indicated and with prior approval of the Medical Monitor. In particular, if an abnormal result is observed that is not resolved by [CONTACT_53601], repeated tests should be performed with prior approval until resolution of the abnormality.  
6.2.7. Adverse Event s 
Adverse events  will be recor ded for all subjects during the Week [ADDRESS_857681] administration of 
investigational drug in this study will be recorded as part of the Updated Medical History taken 
on Day 1 (Baseline). Once the first dose of investigational drug is taken on Day [ADDRESS_857682] to follow -up.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up 
includes any supplemental investigations necessary to elucidate as completely as practical the nature and/or causality of the AE.  This may include additionally laboratory tests or investigations histopathological examinations or consultation with other health care professionals.  Investigators are not obliged to actively seek AE information from former study participants.  However, if the investigator learns of an SAE at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study and the event may reasonably be considered related to the use of the study drug, the investigator should promptly telephone the Medical Monitor.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence or unintended change from the subject’s pre-
treatment condition, including inter-current illness, that occurs during the course of a clinical trial after treatment has started, whether considered related to study treatment or not. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.

Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
 When possible, AEs should be described by [CONTACT_149724] (e.g., “cold” or 
“seasonal allergies” instead of “runny nose”).  
 The description of each AE should use the following definitions.  
Severity  
 The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported in detail as indicated on 
the CRF:  
 
 Mild :  easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with normal 
everyday activities.  
 Moderate:  sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
 Severe:  incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities.  
 
Relationship to Investigational Drug  
 The relationship of investigational drug to each AE will be determined by [CONTACT_640903]:  
 
 Not related :  The event was clearly related to other factors, such as the subject’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
 Unlikely :  The event was most likely produced by [CONTACT_1604], such as the subject’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject; and did not follow a known response pattern to the investigational drug. 
 Possible :  The event followed a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigation al drug administration; and/or followed a known response pattern to the 
investigational drug; but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1604], such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
 Probable :  The event followed a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational drug administration; and followed a known response pattern to the investigational drug; and could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
 Highly Probable :  The event followed a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational drug administration; and followed a known response pattern to the investigational drug; and could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject; and either occurred immediately following investigational drug administration or improved on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_640886].

Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_857684]’s CRF. Please remember to provide the subject identification number, subject initials and other appropriate terminology and ensure the narrative is comprehensive and includes a chronological description and assessment of the event.  The process for reporting an SAE including those that are considered a consequence of investigational drug, of overdose, or associated with  pregnancy is as follows: 
 
• Complete an SAE form; 
• Complete the narrative which should be comprehensive and include a chronological 
description and assessment of the event; 
• Complete the fax cover sheet  and fa
 x the SAE form to  
• Ens
ure the SAE is documented in the source documents and that an AE page is created in the 
subject ’s eCRF ; 
 
For life -threatening or fatal events, the Investigator (or designee) must call the Medical 
Moni
tor immediately. All SAEs must be reported within [ADDRESS_857685] details are provided in the 
Investigator Site File/Regulatory Binder.

Protocol Amendment #6 ACP-103-015 June 30, 2010 
Confidential and 
Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. should continue to be reported within 24 hours of discovery, particularly life- threatening or fatal 
events, and the Investigator should continue to provide reports to the IRB /EC, as required. In the 
event of any SAE (other than death), the subject will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_737] (or 
designee) using the telephone number provided in the subject information sheet. All subjects experiencing an SAE will be seen by [CONTACT_387427]. 
6.2.8. Overdose of Investigational Medicinal Product 
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than 
specified in the protocol.  It must be reported irrespective of outcome even if toxic effects were not observed.  
Any events that are the consequence of investigational drug overdose and which meet the criteria 
for a SAE  (Secti on [IP_ADDRESS])  should be reported via the SAE forms. Any case of overdose must be 
treated according to the current medical practice and followed until resolution or until the subject’s condition is considered stabl e. 
6.2.9. Pregnancy  
Any subje
ct who becomes pregnant (with or without AEs) should be reported on the Clinical 
Trial Pregnancy form. This form should be sent to  (see 
contact [CONTACT_77268] [IP_ADDRESS]). Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must 
be
 withdrawn from treatment and will be followed until delivery or termination of pregnancy. 
Any events that are the consequence 
of pregnancy and which meet the criteria for serious 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) should also be reported via the SAE forms provided and according to the 
directions in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
6.2.10. Emergency Treatment  
Duri
ng and following a subject’s participation in the trial, the Investigator/institution should 
ensure that adequate medical care is provided to a subject for any AEs, including clinically 
significant laboratory values, related to the trial. The Investigator/institution shoul d inform a 
subject when medical care is needed for intercurrent illness( es) of which the Investigator 
becomes aware.  
7. CLINICAL EVALUATIONS
7.1 Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)  
This scale will be administered  to all subjects during Study Month 1 V isit 4. The SAPS 
(Andreasen, 1984) was designed to measure positive psychotic symptoms, especially in schizophrenia.  Positive symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, abnormalities in language and behavior, and disordered thought processes. Two of the SAPS subscales, Hallucinations and Delusions, will be used in this trial (see  Appendix 3) . The selection of these domains is based 

ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 35 
Protocol Amendment #6 ACP-103-015 June 30, 2010 
Confidential
 and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. principally on their relevance to the specific symptomatology of the PDP population, their utility, 
as demonstrated in a pr evious study of pi[INVESTIGATOR_640872] (ACP-103-006) for 
assessing the severity (reflective of frequency and duration) of these symptoms, and their high inter-rater reliability.  
At study sites located outside the [LOCATION_002], qualified raters will be trained and certified to adminis
ter the SAPS.  At U.S. sites, a centralized rating service, will conduct the 
SAPS
 assessment at the Month 1 Visit 4 only.  The centralized rating service is being used to 
control for possible bias in face- to-face ratings, and to obtain a “blinded” rating of subject 
symptom severity and change.  A remote blinded rater (i.e., mental health evaluator) from the centralized service will conduct the SAPS using videoconference technology.  The remote rater will be bl ind to the study design, entrance criteria, visit number, and treatment assignment.  The 
videoconferencing technology used to connect the subject with the remote rater will be Polycom videoconferencing equipment connected over an IP VPN (Virtual Private Connection). There will be no connection or access to or from any other device, including the Public Internet.  These combined technologies ensure that the remote assessment is conducted in privacy and allows the remote rater to assess all aspects of the SAP S. 
Subjects whose SAPS ratings are being conducted by [CONTACT_640905] t
o have their assessments recorded.   The recordings will be used for training and/or 
quality control purposes by   [CONTACT_640906]/or viewed 
by [CONTACT_640907], to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_2371].   Subject names or other identifying information will 
not be used in training records or publications.   A unique code number that is assigned to the 
subjects will identify their recordings.  The recordings will be maintained in a locked area with 
limited access.  The recordings will be erased no later than one (1) year after the study ends.  
Subjects can  still participate in the study even if they choose not to have their assessments 
recorded.  
7.2 Unifi
ed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)  
Motor function will be evaluated by [CONTACT_640908].  
Note:  the UPDRS assessments are to be conducted in the “on” state.  This will ensure that noise associated with a subject’s “on/off” status does not confound interpretations of the motor function data.
 
The UPDRS is a comprehensive battery of motor and behavioral indices derived from the Columbia Scale (Fahn et al., 1987;  Appendix 4) , providing explicit rating criteria that have 
undergone considerable testing for reliability.  Parts II and I II will be administered to all subjects 
at the  Week [ADDRESS_857686] withdraws or is terminated from the study, at 
an End-of-Study visit.

Protocol Amendment #6 ACP-103-015 June 30, 2010 
Confidential and 
Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. 7.3 Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The CGI allows the Investigator to determine, in  a global sense, how severely psychotic these 
subjects are in the context of other PD subjects using the CGI -S and how much improvement is 
seen using the C GI-I. This instrument is a reliable scale that allows the Investigator to ignore 
baseline dementia, personality traits, and a “reasonable” degree of anxiety that usually 
accompanies clinical motor fluctuations and other peculiar aspects of PD. The CGI scale appears in Appendix 5.  
These scales (CGI -S and CGI- I) will be administered to all subjects at the Week [ADDRESS_857687] withdraws or is terminated from the study, at an End-of-Study visit.  
7.4 Caregiver Burden Scale 
The Caregiver Burde n Scale (Appendix 2) will be administered to the subject ’s attending 
caregiver  at the  Week [ADDRESS_857688] specifically in caregivers of subjects with Alzheimer’s disease.  Nonetheless, it has been reported t o have high reliability in PD ( Aarsland 
et al., 1999).  
7.[ADDRESS_857689], there are no instruments specifically developed to capture this information in the PDP patient population.  The Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) instrument was originally developed for use in patients with dementia to capture the use of resources by [CONTACT_640909] a clinical trial (Wimo et al., 1998).  The assessment of both formal and informal resource use of the patient and primary caregiver makes it possible to calculate costs from a societal perspective.  The RUD and RUD Lite have been used in several completed and ongoing clinical trials of investigational drugs, and are the most widely used instruments for the collection of resource use data in dementia (Appendix 6).  
The RUD Lite is an a
daptation of the full RUD and is designed to decrease the time burden 
associated with completing multiple assessments during the typi[INVESTIGATOR_637546] s tudy visit.  For the 
purposes of this study, the RUD Lite instrument has been further adapted to make it compatible with the PDP patient population.  It is administered as a structured interview with the primary caregiver or other person with knowledge about the patient situation.  The validity and reliability of the RUD instrument has been investigated in the residential care setting as well as community care setting ( Wimo & Nordberg, 2007; Wimo et al., 2003a,b).  Its application in other diseases, 
including PDP, has not been studied; however, it has good face validity and is readily adaptable for use in other chronic disorders in older age-groups involving a substantial component of informal care.

8. ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACOKINETICS
Blood samples will be collected at the  Week [ADDRESS_857690] withdraws or is 
terminated from the study, at an End-of-Study visit prior to administration of investigational drug 
on those days. Details of the time of administratio n of the prior day’s dose together with the time 
of sample collection will aid the interpretation of the concentration data. Section [IP_ADDRESS] includes additional information regarding PK sample collection and bioanalytical processing.  
Pharmacokineti
c data will be summarized descriptively. If appropriate, data will be further 
stratified by [CONTACT_654], gender, and/or other demographic variables. As appropriate, graphic summaries of the PK data will be prepared.

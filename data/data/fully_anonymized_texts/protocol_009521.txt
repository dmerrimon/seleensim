Version 9 .0 Page 10  of 31  1 May  2023  1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Objective   
Our primary objective is to assess whether in arm 1, changes in quantitative tumor 
perfusion parameters 3 weeks  after start  of treatment of metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma (mRCC) patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI) plus immune 
checkpoint inhibitor  (ICI), as measured by [CONTACT_740352], can predict  initial 
objective response to therapy at [ADDRESS_1011980]- of-care Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST  
v1.1)1. 
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
Our secondary objectives are to evaluate in arm 1, if there is an optimal ultrasound 
imaging modality (power Doppler or LEAD ultrasound),  or optimal time point to 
predict initial objective response. We will assess how well 1) changes in tumor 
perfusion parameters 6 weeks after start of treatment by [CONTACT_740353] 2) 
tumor perfusion parameters at a single time point (treatment ‘baseline’ , 3 weeks , 
or 6 weeks after start of  treatment) , predict  initial objective response ( at 12 weeks ) 
per RECIST  v1.1. 
 Additional exploratory objectives in both arms are to assess the correlation of 
tumor perfusion parameters with change in overall tumor burden (defined as sum 
of the longest diameters of all measurable lesions  defined by [CONTACT_393]  v1.1) 12 
weeks after start of treatment, with change in diameter on a per -lesion basis 
(correlation between perfusion parameters of a single lesion with change in diameter of that lesion), and with 12-month progression- free survival (PFS) . 
 
 2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1011981] common cancer in the U.S. and patients with 
metastatic RCC (mRCC) have a 5 -year overall survival (OS) rate of 12%2. There 
are 17 FDA-approved drugs for mRCC , which  include TKIs of vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 , a key mediator of angiogenesis), and 
antibodies that target immune checkpoint  proteins such as programmed cell death  
protein-1 (PD-1), programmed death ligand -1 (PD-L1), or cytotoxic T -lymphocyte-
associated protein 4 (CTLA -4)3–10. 
 
In April 2019, the FDA approved the combinations of a TKI  (axitinib)  with an ICI  
(pembrolizumab or avelumab)  for first -line treatment of mRCC and additional TKI 
plus ICI combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (cabozantinib plus nivolumab, lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab) have been approved more recently11,12. TKI plus ICI has become 
the new standard- of-care first -line treatment that improves OS  for patients with 
mRCC11. 
 
Early Therapeutic Monitoring of Response to Therapy with Serial Ultrasound in Metastatic Renal Cell

Version [ADDRESS_1011982] the smaller vasculature of tumors and the potential changes in tumor vasculature becomes increasingly difficult. Hence, in addition to the commercially available power Doppler imaging mode, we will incorporate advanced power Doppler imaging techniques that improve the sensitivity to slower flow and smaller vessels in our study. Specifically, this advanced power Doppler mode utilizes long Doppler ensembles combined with short -lag angular 
coherence beamforming to achieve high sensitivity to slow flow and small vessels  
(Long Ensemble Angular -coherence Doppler [LEAD] ultrasound). The long 
Doppler ensemble increases the sensitivity to flow by [CONTACT_740354] (~300 Hz) to boost the si gnal-to-noise ratio of the blood signal
13. Moreover , 
angular coherence beamforming is utilized in LEAD ultrasound studies  to 
suppress motion/flash artifact over the long ensemble while also suppressing incoherent noise due to reverberation and thermal nois e
14,15. 
 
For the ultrasound exams at treatment ‘baseline’ and 3 and 6 weeks after initiating treatment  in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] , lesions are imaged with B -mode and power Doppler 
ultrasound  using a portable Siemens Acuson S3000 ultrasound scanner  and a 
6C1 or similar transducer (FDA -approved for clinical ultrasound exams but  used 
only for research exams for this study). Measurements are performed in the long axis and short axis planes , if possible by [CONTACT_740355] . For LEAD ultrasound 
exams,  the same views are obtained using a Verasonics Vantage 256 scanner 
with a C5 -2v or similar transducer  (research ultrasound scanner) . 
 
2.3 Clinicaltrials.gov  
The Verasonics system operates under an  abbreviated Investigational Device 
Exemption (IDE)  approved by [CONTACT_55790] . The device has non- significant 
risk. The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov under registration number

27,30,31. Hence changes in tumor vascularity may be especially important in 
RCC patients receiving TKI therapy  (alone or in combination with other drugs) . 
 We have previously found that imaging- based biomarkers (e.g. , perfusion CT, 
‘4D-CT’ scans, or novel positron emission tomography [ PET] tracers such as  F18-
FPPRGD2 that binds blood vessels) may have the capability of detecting early response to anti -angiogenic therapy in mRCC
32,33. However, due to renal 
dysfunction and often only a solitary remaining kidney after resection of the initial kidney primary lesion, patients are not always eligible for perfusion CT, which requires potentially nephrotoxic iodinated contrast. A limitation of PET imaging is that nuclear imaging does not provide measurements of blood flow. Hence, there is an important clinical need for complimentary, non- nephrotoxic imaging that can 
be serially repeated without exposure to ionizing radiation, to predict respo nse 
and resistance to TKI plus ICI and other mRCC therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 In addition, not all patients can tolerate TKI plus ICI combination therapy, so we have added an exploratory arm [ADDRESS_1011986] changes in tumor perfusion in patients who are planned to receive non-
ICI therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. These include, but are not limited to: TKI monotherapy, combination of TKI with another kinase inhibitor (e.g., mTOR inhibitor), localized tumor therapy such as radiation, radioembolization, chemoembolization. (Patients receiving 
ICI/ICI combination the rapy or ICI monotherapy are enrolled in the parallel 
ultrasound study ‘Serial Ultrasound to Detect Early Response to Immunotherapy in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma’ (RENAL0045). The choice of treatment is made by [CONTACT_740357]- of-care (e.g., comorbidities and performance status, need for immediate 
control over tumor growth versus long- lasting tumor control, response to previous 
treatments, tolerance of previous treatments). Patients are assigned to a study arm based on the treatment plan at the time of enrollment.  
 Contrast -enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been used for the identification of 
renal focal lesions and has shown some promise in preliminary studies to monitor 
changes with therapy
34,35. However, CEUS has not widely been explored as a 
methodology to monitor anti -angiogenesis or combination therapy. Furthermore, 
the use of CEUS to monitor therapeutic response may be unnecessary, as recent advances in power Doppler imaging have yielded non- contrast, high- sensitivity 
perfusion imaging  by [CONTACT_740358]

2.6 Study Design  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], single group imaging study, testing a new method of therapeutic 
response assessment, power Doppler ultrasound, in mRCC patients treated with TKI 
plus ICI  (arm 1) or non -ICI therapy ( arm 2). A total of [ADDRESS_1011988] meet all of the following general inclusion criteria:  
• 18 years of age or older  
• pathology -confirmed diagnosis of RCC  
• at least one tumor lesion greater than 1 cm in diameter, amenable to ultrasound 
imaging  
• written informed consent.  
 
In addition, patients must meet the following specific inclusion criteria for the 
respective study arm:  Arm 1: TKI plus ICI Treatment  
• planned to be treated with combination of VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI) plus immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) * 
 
* prior use of either class of drugs is not necessarily excluded, and patients may be included with 
the approval of the Protocol Director  
 Arm 2: Non- ICI Treatment  
• planned to be treated with non -ICI therapy**  
 
** including, but not limited to: TKI monotherapy, other kinase inhibitors (e.g., mTOR inhibitors) 
alone or in combination with TKIs, localized tumor therapy such as radiation, chemo- or 
radioembolization  
 Subjects may participate in the study more than once at the discretion of  the 
Protocol  Director, for example, if they receive different lines of treatment that all 
qualify for the study.  
 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Any comorbid condition* ** that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_740344], compromises the participant’s ability to participate in the study.

• the c linical ultrasound machine is set up with a research function to keep clinical 
care and research separate (not applicable to this study, as all scanners are exclusively used 
for research) . 
Performing the exam includes holding the transducer, providing patient care related 
to the exam in collaboration with the investigators, and documenting the encounter in the patient’s Stanford Healthcare medical record. Investigators with expertise in 
ultrasound are allowed to be present and provide assistance with operating the 
instrument to the licensed professional . Assistance may include image review, 
instrument operation during the scan, but not  providing any patient -related care or 
holding the transducer.

time point is missed  entirely , subsequent exams may still be performed in full within their allowed time window.  
b) Standard- of-care imaging: The baseline standard-of -care scan is generally within [ADDRESS_1011996] -Abdomen- Pelvis (CAP) scan (with or without contrast), but it may 
also be an MRI or PET/CT  or a combination of MRI and CT .  At the discretion of the treating oncologist, the standard- of-
care scan at week 12 may be performed outside of the +/ - 4-week window.  
c) Adverse event (AE) evaluation: Only AEs that are attributed to the study procedures are recorded and reported. During 
study procedures, study coordinator reminds patient to contact [CONTACT_192942], if they experience any symptoms 
during the exam or afterwards. If the participant expr esses to the coordinator that they have experienced symptoms 
during or after the exam, the coordinator will alert  the clinical care team on the same day to contact [CONTACT_740363]. During baseline through week 12, patient will continue with standard-of -care provider visits 
at or outside of Stanford (generally, every 2- 6 weeks, at the discretion of the treating clinical care team) including adverse 
event management. At week 12, a retrospective chart review will document any undisclosed study -related late adverse 
events and assure there are no ongoing study -related adverse events. If there is no adequate information in the medical 
record at week 12, patient will be contact[CONTACT_740364]. Therefore, at minimum, there is

the need for medical intervention.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting 
For this study, only Adverse Events ( AEs) attributed to ultrasound use are  
reported.  
During study procedures,  the study coordinator reminds patient to contact [CONTACT_226339], if they experience any symptoms during the exam or afterwards. If the participant expresses to the coordinator that they have experienced symptoms during or after the exam, the coordinat or will alert the 
clinical care team on the same day to contact [CONTACT_740366]. During baseline through week 12, patient will continue with standard- of-care provider visits at or outside of Stanford  (generally, every 2- 6 
weeks, at the discretion of the treating clinical care team) including adverse event management. At week 12, a retrospective chart review will document any undisclosed study -related late adverse events and assure there are no ongoing  
study -related adverse events. If there is no adequate information in the medical 
record at week 12, patient will be contact[CONTACT_740364]. Therefore, at minimum, there is one documented AE evaluation at week 12.  
 AEs are graded according to CTCAE v 5.0. Both Serious and Non- Serious study -
related AEs are clearly noted in source documentation and listed on study specific 
Case Report Forms  in RedCAP . The Protocol Director or designee assess each 
AE to determine whether it is unexpected according to the Informed Consent  or 
Protocol Document and related to the investigation. All study -related Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs) are  tracked until resolution.  AEs and SAEs  related  to 
standard- of-care procedures or medication, including the studied drug therapy  for 
RCC, are not recorded or reported.

8.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant 
information related to the study ( e.g., advertisements used to recruit participants) 
must be  reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_740367] (SRC) . Any changes made to the protocol will be submitted as a 
modification to be approved by [CONTACT_740368]. The 
Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment information to all participating investigators.  
 
8.2 Data Management Plan  
An alphanumeric study code is selected by [CONTACT_740369].  Source documents and analytic data are used to complete the 
electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) in the Stanford RedCAP database.  An  
eCRFs  needs to be completed for each enrolled patient and , at minimum, needs 
to contain the following data:  
- study code  
- age, race, ethnicity, sex, diagnosis, cancer stage, tumor histology, and drug treatment  
- identification of lesions selected for ultrasound exams and for response evaluation  
- identification of time points and modality of ultrasound exams and standard-of-care radiographic imaging  
- tumor perfusion parameters quantified from ultrasound studies  
- tumor diameter measurements quantified from standard- of-care radiographic 
imaging studies  
- primary and secondary outcomes measures.  
 
The digital ultrasound images including PHI may be stored on the ultrasound scanners for the duration for the study. Ultrasound image files that are transferred off the scanners have coded file names and the files are stored on [CONTACT_410673]’s lab 
servers  or using cloud storage services that are certified for PHI (e.g. , Stanford 
Medicine Box) . Other source documents need to be included in the regulatory 
binder . The Stanford's Data & Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will routinely 
review the source documentation (incl. the raw imaging files on [CONTACT_410673]’s lab servers) and verify the corresponding data entered in the eCRFs. All entered, changed, and final data shall be available with a validated audit trail or data extract report. The eCRFs shall be considered complete when all expected data has been entered and all discrepancies have been resolved or documented.  
 Source documents, other documents containing HIPAA identifiers, clinico -
demographic or  analytic data linked to the participants’ identity ( i.e., Protected 
Health Information, PHI), and information linking study codes to participant identities may be additionally maintained in paper form or electronically on co-
investigators’ computers or using cloud storage services that are certified for PHI

Version 9 .0 Page 20  of 31  1 May  2023  (e.g., OnCore, Stanford Medicine Box)  until study completion. All computers need 
to comply with Stanford University IT security standards. Access to files and 
folders  with PHI (paper or electronic) must be restricted to the study personnel .  
 
Upon study closure, a ll PHI  not stored in the regulatory binder  (physical and 
electronic), regulatory database (i.e., OnCore),  or eCRFs  must be destroyed , for 
example by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]- identifying the data and files in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy 
Rule. Ultrasound data must be removed from the ultrasound scanners upon study 
closure . However,  ultrasound images with PHI may be retained in the electronic 
medical record at Stanford Healthcare at the discretion of the study radiologists  
as long as they are clearly designated as research data and not associated with a formal interpretation . 
 The Protocol Directors have ultimate responsibility for collection and reporting of all clinical safety  and study data entered in the eCRFs and any other data 
collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are attributable, legible, contemporaneous (timely), original, and accurate as well as complete, consistent, and available when required.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1012000] Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC ) will 
audit study -related activities at least annually in accordance with the DSMC SOP 
to determine whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  This may include review of  regulatory binders, case report forms, 
eligibility checklists, and source documents. In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious adverse events and protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the protection of human subjects. Results of DSMC audit s will 
be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed.

analysis. Specifically, our outcome, initial objective response, will be 
regressed on the change in each of the LEAD ultrasound tumor perfusion parameters after 3 weeks of treatment and relevant demographic and clinical characteristics. T he measurement of LEAD 
ultrasound tumor perfusion parameters  and the definition of their change 
are described in more detail below. We will not use selection techniques 
to choose variables . Rather, we will include  all factors  in our model 
jointly . We will evaluate the predictive ability of our model using area 
under the curve (AUC)  and calculate a 95% confidence interval for the 
AUC. Since our sample size is to o small to allow for separate training 
and testing datasets, we will utilize cross- validation techniques for 
evaluating predictive performance. 
 
Selection of lesions for LEAD ultrasound exams : 
Before the first ultrasound exam, the treating medical oncologist, a Protocol Director, or a designated radiologist select s up to 5 lesions per 
patient  (target lesions per RECIST v1.1) . At the treatment ‘baseline’ 
LEAD ultrasound exam  (up to 28 days prior to start of treatment) , 
perfusion of these 5 lesions is  measured. Additional lesions may be 
assessed at the discretion of the investigators, so that in the end up to 5 lesions are selected for repeat ultrasound exams that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] s lend themselves to reproducible tumor perfusion 
measurements . LEAD ultrasound tumor perfusion measurements  of the 
up to 5 lesions that were selected for ultrasound studies at the treatment ‘baseline’ exam  are performed again 3 weeks (+/ - 8 days) after start of 
treatment.  
 Quantification of tumor perfusion parameters : 
The following parameters are  computed from the LEAD ultrasound 
measurements for each lesion:  
• overall tumor perfusion: the integrated power within the tumor  
• average red cell flux: the integrated power within the tumor normalized by [CONTACT_44871] 
• tumor -to-background perfusion ratio: the ratio of the integrated 
power within the tumor to the integrated power in a same sized region in nearby [CONTACT_740372].

Version 9 .0 Page 24  of 31  1 May  2023  Changes in tumor perfusion parameters after 3 weeks of treatment:  
Defined as relative change in these parameters, i.e., difference between 
time points divided by [CONTACT_740370] 1, expressed as percentage. 
For determining the relative change in several lesions of the same patient, the average of the relative changes in the up to [ADDRESS_1012009] two regression analyses: (1) using power 
Doppler  measurements and (2) using LEAD ultrasound measurements. 
AUCs between the two models will be compared using the nonparametric approach of DeLong for correlated AUC curves
43. In addition, we will compare 
AUCs between these models to the predictive model for the primary analysis.  
 To assess if there is an optimal time point for predicting initial objective 
response in arm 1, we will conduct Lasso regression models using tumor 
perfusion parameters for each time point ( treatment ‘ baseline’ , 3 weeks, 6 
weeks) separately for each imaging modality using a similar approach as outlined above.  Given the exploratory nature of these analyses, we will not 
adjust for multiple testing.  
 
For each arm, we will conduct correlation analysis for  change in perfusion 
parameters at 3 and 6 weeks and initial relative change in tumor burden 
(overall and per -lesion) , initial overall response, best overall response, and  
PFS until 12 months after initiating treatment by [CONTACT_740373] r or Spearman rank correlation, as appropriate.  PFS is  estimated 
using the Kaplan- Meier method and the Kaplan- Meier curves will be 
presented.

Version 9 .0 Page 25  of 31  1 May  2023  Selection of lesions for ultrasound exams : 
The up to 5 lesions that were selected for ultrasound studies  for the primary 
analysis  are re-assessed 6 weeks (+/ - 15 days) after start of treatment and 
each lesion is assessed with both LEAD and power Doppler ultrasound  at all 
3 time points (treatment ‘baseline’, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks after initiating 
treatment . 
 Quantification and change of tumor perfusion parameters : defined in the 
same way as for the primary analysis for both power Doppler and LEAD ultrasound. 
 10.[ADDRESS_1012010] ing a specific 
research hypothes is, the sample size for each arm  has been  chosen based on 
practical considerations and estimated feasibility. However, for the primary analysis 
(arm 1), we consider a predictive model with a true AUC of at least 0.7 promising for 
predicting initial objective response. With 20 patients and assuming that 59% of patients have an objective response to treatment, a predictive model with a true AUC of at least 0.[ADDRESS_1012011] AUC will be selected for future studies. If 
different predictive models give equivalent AUCs, we will consider additional 
analyses (for example, random forests or Classification and Regression Tree [CART ]) to evaluate these models to determine if a specific model can be selected 
for further studies.  
If any predictive  model from this  pi[INVESTIGATOR_740346] 0.7, the next step 
will be to conduct a larger follow- up study in an independent cohort to validate the 
predictive model and determine its AUC with a  smaller margin of error.  The sample 
size and operating characteristics of the follow -up study will be determined based 
on findings from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_740347]- up study. If the larger follow- up study is also deemed a success  (AUC at least 
0.7), to determine if tumor perfusion measurements by [CONTACT_740374], an adequately powered randomized clinical trial will  be required to

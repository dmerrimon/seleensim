1.0 Background 
 
1.1 Role of autologous stem cell transplantation in myeloma :  High dose therapy and stem 
cell transplantation (SCT) remain the standard of care for patients with  multiple  myeloma 
(MM) who are eligible to undergo the procedure.( Attal, Harousseau et al. 1996 ; Child, 
Morgan et al. 2003 ; Kumar 2009) It is an effective therapy, with improvement in overall 
survival and quality of life (time without symptoms and treatment) compared to 
conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. However, patients with MM undergoing SCT invariably suffer 
disease relapse after a median duration of [ADDRESS_400194]. Patients with high proliferative rates of tumor cells, those with high 
International Staging System (ISS) stage and those with adverse cytogenetic profile, such 
as presence of t(4;14) and t(14;16) are at a higher risk.( Gertz, Lacy et al. 2005) Strategies 
to improve the duration of response to SCT can contribute to improved patient wellbeing and potentially improve survival, and become an integral part of the therapeutic approach 
to MM. The high dose chemotherapy allows significant tumor control and the ability to 
overcome drug resistance.  
 
1.2 Depth of response and outcome : Several lines of evidence suggest that the depth of 
response achieved with various treatments, especially in the context of SCT, is a powerful determinant of the response duration. In multiple studies it has been noted that 
achievement of CR post SCT predicts the duration of response and in some studies the overall survival of these patients. (Rajkumar, Fonseca et al. 2000; Harousseau, Palumbo et 
al. 2010) However, in nearly half of the patients with a clinical CR residual myeloma cells can be detected using more sensitive methods such as multicolor flow cytometry or 
PCR based techniques. In the setting of MM, we know that MRD is an important 
predictor of outcome in patients undergoing aggressive therapy.   Rawstron et al used a sensitive flow cytometry assay that quantitated normal and neoplastic plasma cells (PCs) 
to mo nitor the bone marrow ( BM) of 45 patients undergoing autologous stem cell 
transplant ( ASCT ).(Rawstron, Davies et al. 2002) Among the 42% of patients in whom 
monoclonal PCs were detectable [ADDRESS_400195], the median PFS was 20 months 
compared to 35 months for those with undetectable PCs. Even among those with negative immunofixation studies, considered the hallmark of “CR”, a third had detectable PCs and 
had a poorer outcome. Bakkus et al examined the utility of detecting MRD using a 
quantitative allele -specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO -PCR) assay 
at 3–[ADDRESS_400196]-transplant in 67 patients.( Bakkus, Bouko et al. 2004 ) Using specific 
cutoffs for the quantitative PCR results, the authors identified patients with residual disease and a short time to relapse. Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_324172] ( PB) and BM samples of [ADDRESS_400197] 
and at the time of progression using ASO- qPCR( Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_61222], Cremer et al. 2001). 
Progression was detected early by [CONTACT_324197]. Galimberti  et al examined the 
prognostic value of PCR based monitoring of MRD in [ADDRESS_400198] by [CONTACT_105]-myeloablative allogeneic transplant (NMT). (Galimberti, Benedetti et al. 2005 ) After 
ASCT, only 3 patients (15%) achieved PCR -negativity, versus 12 (60%) after NMT. 76% 
of pati ents with no MRD were still alive at 2 years versus 34% of PCR positive patients.

 1.3 Maintenance strategies after autologous stem cell transplantation : The concept of 
maintenance therapy has been tested mostly in the setting of high dose therapy and 
autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients invariably relapse after initial treatment 
strategies including SCT and various trials have attempted to maintain the SCT response through maintenance approaches. Initial trials prior to the availability of the n ew drugs 
have examined steroids or interferon, and a small randomized clinical trial of interferon - 
(3 x 10
6 units/m2) subcutaneously [ADDRESS_400199] improvement in EFS.( Cunningham, Powles et al. 1998) The IFM99 -[ADDRESS_400200]- risk MM (Beta 2-microglobulin [B2M] <3, no deletion 
13), : to receive no maintenance, pamidronate, or pamidronate plus thalidomide after tandem SCT.( Attal, Harousseau et al. 2006 ) Thalidomide was associated with higher 
response rates, improved EFS (52% vs. 36% with no maintenance) and improved overall survival (4 -year estimated survival from diagnosis with thalidomide (87%) compared 
with no maintenanc e (77%). At least [ADDRESS_400201]. (Lokhorst, van der Holt et al. 2009; 
Spencer, Prince et al. 2009 ; Stewart, Trudel et al. 2010 ) A meta -analysis of these trials 
support  improved progression- free survival, but remains equivocal in terms of overall 
survival improvement. In addition a, high discontinuation rate has been noted in all these 
studies due to toxicity. In particular the Canadian study showed worsening of QoL parameters among patients get ting thalidomide maintenance.( Stewart, Trudel et al. 2010)  
   A phase 3 study from the IFM enrolled 614 patients < 65 years, with non- progressive 
disease, within 6 months after upfront ASC T.(Attal, Lauwers et al. 2010 ) Patients 
received 2 cycles of consolidation with lenalidomide 25 mg daily for 3 of 4 weeks followed by a randomization to lenalidomide 10- 15 mg/day  until relapse or to placebo 
(n=307 in each arm). Patients were stratified according to Beta-2M, del13, and VGPR to 
initial therapy. There was an improvement in the PFS with maintenance therapy, with a median PFS of 42 months for lenalidomide vs. 24 months for the placebo. The 
improvement in the PFS was seen in all the subgroups based on stratification. With the 
current follow-up, overall survival (OS) remains identical in the two groups. In a very 
similar trial, McCarthy and colleagues randomized patients [ADDRESS_400202] within one year of diagnosis, to lenalidomide (5- 15 mg/day) or placebo until 
relapse. (McCarthy, Owzar et al. 2010) Patients were stratified based on Beta-2M and use 
of thalidomide or lenalidomide therapy during induction. Patients were enrolled prior to 
the ASCT, with 19% of the [ADDRESS_400203] an improvement in the overall survival for the lenalidomide arm in 
the CALGB study. There are differences, however, between the two trials in terms of the 
design as well as duration of therapy. Patients in the IFM trial received uniform induction 
therapy unlike the CALGB trial. Patients in the IFM study received 2 cycles of consolidation with lenalidomide before starting maintenance. In addition, the IFM trial 
limited maintenance to approximately 24 months based on concerns regarding second 
malignancies and did not allow cross over. However, the CALGB trial allowed cross over 
MC128B 7  MCCC Addendum 5

from placebo arm to lenalidomide maintenance based on interim analysis and also 
allowed main tenance until progression.  
 
  So the bulk of evidence points to the importance of exploring continued treatment 
approaches in the majority of patients with myeloma post -SCT, preferable in the context 
of clinical trials. In vitro studies suggest that the ma jor obstacle to eradicating the tumor 
clone of myeloma is the result of the protective tumor microenvironment that exists in the 
marrow. Clearly novel approaches need to be examined in the context of SCT for 
eradication of residual disease. This is even mo re relevant today, with the deep responses 
we are able to obtain with new agents pre- SCT, thus enabling the use of experimental 
approaches in the context of minimal residual disease.  
 
1.4 Hedgehog signaling in myeloma : In multiple myeloma, the abnormal proliferation of 
plasma cells is very much dependent on the bone marrow microenvironment.( Podar, 
Richardson e t al. 2007 ) Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is a highly conserved pathway that 
plays an important role in development in both vertebrates and invertebrates (Ingham and 
McMahon 2001). Aberrant functioning of the Hh pathway has been reported in several tumors including prostate and lung cancers. To summarize the Hh pathway, Hh ligands 
secreted by [CONTACT_324198], namely indian (Ihh), sonic (Shh) and desert (Dhh) bind to 
their receptor, patched (PTCH) on tumor cells. This binding alleviates the inhibition of 
PTCH on its downstream target, smoothened (Smo), thereby [CONTACT_324199]. This activation 
leads to activation of the cubitus interruptus -like transcription factor involved in glioma 
formation (Gli) which promotes the transcription of its target genes leading to tumor 
development and progression ( Xie and Abbruzzese 2003). In the myeloma  setting it has 
been found that Hh pathway is essential for maintaining a subset of tumor causing stem cells. Blocking t he Hh pathway by [CONTACT_324200], an inhibitor of Smo, did minimize the clonal expansion of the subset of 
tumor causing stem cells by [CONTACT_324201] (Peacock, Wang et 
al. 2007) . When MM cell cultures were treated with cyclopamine and cell viability was 
examined, it was found that the MM cells were less viable in the presence of cyclopamine 
than in the absence of it (Dierks, Grbic et al. 2007 ). More recently , Blotta et al 
demonstrated that plasma cells from MGUS patients express higher levels of Ihh/Shh, 
Smo and Ptch1 receptors, as well as Gli1 and Gli2 transcription factors, but lower levels 
of the repressor genes Ptch2 and Gli3 compared with normal plasma cells. (Blotta, 
Jakubikova et al. 2012 ) Similarly , plasma cells from patients with MM showed up -
regulation of Ptch1, Gli1 and Gli2 and down-regulation of Ptch2 and Gli3, again 
supporting a role of this pathway in myeloma pathogenesis. In contrast, these changes were less obvious in cell lines and plasma cell leukemia likely reflecting the lack of 
microenvironment dependence in these situations. The investigators were also able to 
show activation of both ligand dependent (canonical) as well as independent (non-
canonical) mechanisms for the up regulation of Hh pathway seen in MM. Finally, these 
studies confirmed prior observations regarding the stromal cells being a major source of 
Shh that can drive prolifer ation of myeloma cells as well as afford protection against anti -
myeloma drugs.  
   1.5 LDE225: LDE225 is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable Smo antagonist. LDE225 
is a high -affinity ligand for human and mouse Smo, as shown by [CONTACT_324202], with an IC50 of 11 nM for human Smo and 12 nM for mouse 
MC128B 8  MCCC Addendum 5 
 
Protocol version date :  25Jul2018   
Smo. In multiple cell -based assays, LDE225 is a potent antagonist of Hh -dependent 
pathway activation. It inhibits Hh -mediated Gli1 acti vation in mouse TM3 and human 
HEPM cells with an IC50 of [ADDRESS_400204] shown significant efficacy 
of LDE225, particularly in combination with bortezomib.( Blotta, Jakubikova et al. 2012) 
  LDE225 was well tolerated in mice with no significant body weight loss at all doses (up 
to 160 mg/kg QD) investigated. In vivo PK/PD analysis in MB models showed a good correlation between the given dose, the measured blood and tissue levels, the effects o n 
the Hh pathway as measured by [CONTACT_324203]1 mRNA expression and the anti- tumor activity. It 
appeared that almost complete and sustained Gli1 mRNA inhibition (above 
approximately 95%) is required to yield tumor regression in the animal models studied. LDE225 was well absorbed with Tmax occurring within 0.[ADDRESS_400205] striking of these pharmacologic effects were on growing bones and teeth (growing incisors in rodents). 
The bone effects inc luded thinning or closure of the bone growth plates in the sternum 
and femur. Effects on the reproductive systems were seen in rats and dogs. GI toxicity was likely dose limiting in the animal studies. In the GLP juvenile rat study minimal to 
slight degene ration of nerve fibers was found in the sciatic nerve and, less commonly, in 
the thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], but not in the cervical or lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_324173]. 
Effects  on nerves were not seen in any of the toxicity studies on more mature rats or 
dogs. 
 
We have examined the activity of LDE in combination with lenalidomide in myeloma, 
especially in the context of bone marrow derived stroma l cells  or tumor 
microenvironment. In in vitro experiments, LDE225 treatment of myeloma cell lines resulted in a modest inhibition of cell proliferation at increasing doses ( Figure 1 ).

LDE225 and lenalidomide for 72 hours and cell viability was measured by [CONTACT_324204]. Y-axis represents the thymidine uptake as counts per min. standardized to 
the control. 
 
1.6 Clinical experience with LDE225 : LDE225 is currently undergoing evaluation in three 
Phase I clinical trials (CLDE225X2101, CLDE225X1101 and CLDE225X2104) and one Phase II trial (CLDE225A2201) to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and potential 
efficacy of continuous daily oral administration in patients with malignant solid tumors.  
As of October, 2011, data were available on [ADDRESS_400206] been 
treated with LDE225 at dose levels of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, 1500, and 3000 mg once 
daily (QD) and 250, 400 and 750 mg twice daily (BID). Based on the available data, the 
recommended phase II of LDE225 in adults is 800 mg once daily. DLTs that are 
characterized by [CONTACT_324205] 3 or 4 increases in plasma creatine phosphokinase (CK) 
observed at once daily doses ≥ 800 mg and twice daily doses ≥250 mg. The majority of the DLT events occurred during the initial 4 -6 weeks of treatment with LDE225. None of 
the patients experienced impairment of renal function as a result of this toxicity. The 
DLTs resolved following discontinuation of LDE225 therapy. Across all the doses studied, the commonly (>10%) reported CTCAE grade 1 or 2 adverse events that are 
suspected to be treatment -related include: nausea, vomiting, dysgeusia, decreased 
appetite, myalgia, muscle spasms, blood CK increased, alopecia, asthenia and fatigue.  
 
1.7 Study Rationale : These findings form the basis of evaluation of HH inhibition as a 
strategy to enhance the activity of lenalidomide in the post-transplant maintenance 
setting. The minimal residual state post SCT provides the most optimal situation for 
evaluation of a drug that is likely to work by [CONTACT_324206].

6.1 Registration Procedures 
 
 To register a patient, access the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) web page and enter 
the remote registration/randomization application. The remote registration/randomization 
application is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Back up and/or system support 
contact [CONTACT_15920]. If unable to access the Web site, call the 
MCCC Registration Office a  between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. 
Central Time (Monday through Friday).The instructions for remote registration are 
available on the MCCC web page  and detail the 
process for completing and confirming patient registration. Prior to initiation of protocol treatment, this process must be completed in its entirety and a MCCC subject ID number 
must be available as noted in the instructions. It is the responsibility of the individual registering the patient to confirm the process has been successfully completed prior to 
release of the study agent. Patient registration via the remote system can be confirmed in 
any of the following ways: 1) Contact [CONTACT_128743] . If 
the patient was fully registered, the Registration Office staff can access the information from the centralized database and confirm the registration. 2) Refer to “Instructions for Remote Registration” in section “Fi nding/Displaying Information about a registered 
subject”.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_400224] be on file  (no less than annually) 
at the Registration Office   If the necessary documentation is not 
submitted in advance of attempting patient registration, the registration will not be 
accepted and the patien t may not be enrolled in the protocol until the situation is resolved.   
 When the study has been permanently closed to patient enrollment, submission of annual 
IRB approvals to the Registration Office is no longer necessary

A new cycle of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if:  
• The ANC is ≥ 1000/μL  
• The platelet count is ≥  50,000/μ  L 
• Any other drug- related adverse event that may have occurred has resol ved to 
≤ grade [ADDRESS_400229] will be evaluated weekly and a new cycle of therapy will be held until the toxicity 
has resolved as described abov e.   
If any drug dosing was halted during the previous cycle and was restarted 
with a one -level dose reduction without requiring an interruption for the

remainder of the cycle, then that reduced dose level will be initiated on Day 1 
of the new cycle.  
If any drug  dosing was omitted for the remainder of the previous cycle or if 
the new cycle is held due to known hematologic toxicity newly encountered 
on the scheduled Day 1, then the new cycle will be started with a one- level 
dose reduction.  If a new cycle of therapy cannot be restarted within 4 weeks 
of the scheduled day 1, the patient will be removed from protocol therapy 
and will go to event monitoring.

• Omit = The current dose(s) for the specified drug(s) during a cycle is skipped. The patient does not 
make up the omitted dose(s) at a later time 
• Hold/Delay = The current dose(s) of all drugs during a cycle is delayed. The patient does make up 
the delayed dose(s) when the patient meets the protocol criteria to restart drugs.  
• Discontinue = The specified drug(s) are totally stopped.   
 
NOTE:  If the toxicity can be attributed to either lenalidomide or LDE225, both drugs must be 
omitted, and once toxicity has resolved to the level allowing restarting the drugs, lenalidomide should be reintroduced first at the same dose level and if no toxicity is observed for the rest of the 
cycle, LDE can be reintroduced at one lower dose level. If the toxicity recurs, lenalidomide stopped and restarted at one lower dose level once toxicity resolves to the required grade. In this situation, 
LDE225 can be restarted at the same level.  
 
NOTE:   If the patient experiences a significant adverse event requiring a dose reduction at the start 
of the next cycle, then the dose will remain lowered for that entire subsequent cycle.  If that cycle is 
completed with no further adverse events >Grade 2, then the dose may be increased, at the 
investigator’s discretion, one level at a time, in the following cycles.  
 
NOTE:   Adverse events requiring a dose -reduction step for any or all drugs beyond the two dose-
reduction steps (leve ls –1 and –2) will be at the discretion of the treating physician, if the decision  
is made for the pati ent to be kept on study.  These dose reductions must be clearly recorded in 
reported clinical data.

10.[ADDRESS_400244], identify and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0.  
Next, determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2 ) 
and if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see Section 10.5).  With this information, determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report (see Section 10.31).  Expedited reports are to be 
completed within the timeframes and via the mechanisms specified in Sections 10.4. All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.6 and 
18.0). 
 
10.[ADDRESS_400245] Level Term (LLT).  Grade is an essential element of the Guidelines and, in general, relates to severity  for the purposes of regulatory reporting to NCI .

as serious AE which  is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 
 10.2  Expected vs. Unexpected  Events  
 
• The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on agent- specific 
information provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol and the study specific consent form . 
 
• Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent -specific information 
provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol and the study specific consent form.

Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s).  
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s).  
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a 
medical treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event .  
 
10.31   AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial Agent(s) on 
the SAME  Arm 
 
NOTE:   When a commercial agent(s) is (are) used on the same 
treatment arm as the investigational agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, cellular product, or other 
investigational therapy under an IND), the entire combination (arm) is then considered an investigational intervention for reporting . 
 
Routine Reporting  
 
• Routine AE reporting for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies using an 
investigational agent /intervention in combination with a commercial agent 
is stated in the protocol.  See Section 10.6.  
 
• Routine AE reporting for Phase 3 clinical studies using an investigational 
agent/intervention and a commercial agent in combination must be reported as defined by [CONTACT_212263], 
Groups, Cancer Centers, or Principal Investigators.  See Section 10.6.  
 
Expedited Reporting  
 
• An AE that occurs on a combination study must be assessed in accordance with 
the guidelines for investigational agents/interventions in Section 10.4, and where 
indicated, an expedited report must be submitted. 
 
• An AE that occurs prior to administration of the investigational 
agent/intervention must be assessed as specified in the protocol. In general, 
only Grade [ADDRESS_400246] possible attribution to the commercial agent require an expedited report.  Refer to 
Section 10.4 for specific AE reporting requirements or exceptions.  
 
• Commercial agent e xpedited reports must be submitted to the FDA via 
MedWatch . 
 
• An investigational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated with a commercial agent.  Therefore, if an expected AE (for the

Protocol version date :  25Jul2018   
 
11.0 Treatment Evaluation – The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)  uniform response 
criteria (Rajkumar et al, 2011) will be used to assess response to therapy. 
11.1 Multiple Myeloma Patients  
 
   11.11  Determination of Baseline values for disease assessment  
 
• Baseline values for disease assessment : All disease response measurements 
will be based on the values obtained at the time of diagnosis if there has been 
no relapse prior to transplant. If patients had a disease relapse prior to  
transplant, the baseline values will be those obtained at the time of relapse 
immediately prior to the transplant. If patient had treatment for the relapsed 
disease prior to transplant, the values will be from prior to this therapy, ie, 
the time of relapse.  
 
Clinical relapse is defined using the definition of clinical relapse in the 
IMWG criteria.   In the IMWG criteria, clinical relapse is defined as 
requiring one or more of the following direct indicators of increasing disease and/or end -organ dysfunction that are considered related to the underlying 
plasma cell proli ferative disorder: 
1.  Development of new soft tissue plasmacytomas or bone lesions on 
skeletal survey, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging 
2.  Definite increase in the size of existing plasmacytomas or bone lesions. 
A definite increase is defined  as a 50% (and at least 1 cm) increase as 
measured serially by [CONTACT_79084]- diameters of 
the measurable lesion  
3.  Hypercalcemia (>11.5 mg/dL; >2.875mM/L) 4.  Decrease in hemoglobin of more than 2 g/dL (1.25mM) or to less than 10 
g/dL 
5.  Rise in serum creatinine by [CONTACT_117172] 2 mg/dL (≥177mM/L) 
6.  Hyperviscosity  
 NOTE:  If the patient does not meet the IMWG criteria for clinical relapse but the patient has increasing M protein leading to a change in clinical 
management, this will also be considered a relapse at the discretion of the 
treating physician. 
 
11.12  Terms and definitions 
 
• M-protein: synonyms include M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], monoclonal protein and myeloma 
protein, paraprotein, M -component. 
 
Serum M -protein level is quantitated using densitometry on SPEP except in 
cases where the SPEP is felt to be unreliable.   
• M-proteins migrating in the β-region (usually IgA M -proteins)  
  
MC128B 39  MCCC Addendum 5 
 
Protocol version date :  25Jul2018   
• Cases in which the M-protein is so large and narrow on agarose (some 
specimens >4 g/dL) that they underestimate the actual immunoglobulin level (by [CONTACT_7809] 1500 mg/dL) due to technical 
staining properties of the agarose gel.  
• Cases in which there are multiple peaks of same M-prot ein 
(aggregates or dimers)  
 If SPEP is not available or felt to be unreliable (above examples) for routine 
M-protein quantitation, then quantitative immunoglobulin levels derived 
from nephelometry or turbidometry can be accepted.  However, this must be explicitly reported at baseline, and only nephelometry can be used for that 
patient to assess response. SPEP derived M-protein values and quantitative nephelometric immunoglobulin values cannot be used interchangeably.   
 
Urine M -protein measurement is estimated using 24-h UPEP only.  Random 
or 24 h urine tests measuring kappa and lambda light chain levels are not reliable and are not recommended.  
 
FLC estimation  is currently carried out using the serum FLC assay (Freelite, 
The Binding Site Limited, [LOCATION_006]).  Patients with kappa/lambda FLC ratio <0.26 
are defined as having monoclonal lambda FLC and those with ratios >1.65 as 
having a monoclonal kappa FLC.  The monoclonal light chain isotype is 
considered the involved FLC isotype, and the opposite light chain type a s the 
uninvolved FLC type.  
 
• Response terms:  The following response terms will be used: stringent 
Complete Response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial 
response (VGPR), partial response (PR), Minimal Response (MR), stable 
disease (SD), and pro gressive disease (PD).  
 
In addition, for each response category, there will be an “unconfirmed” response category, which will be for internal use, for the purpose of guiding 
decision making and test ordering. These designations will applied at the 
time of the first measurement at  which the quantitative aspect of the response 
category has been satisfied without the confirmation step having been 
satisfied. The designation “u” will precede the standard abbreviations, and 
will include usCR, uCR, uVGPR, uPR, uMR, uPD.  
 
• Measurable disease:  Patients who have a measurable serum or urine M-
protein.  
 
o Serum M -protein ≥1 g/dl  
o Urine M -protein ≥ 200 mg/24 h 
o Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≥  10 mg/dl provided serum FLC 
ratio is abnormal  
 
  
MC128B 40  MCCC Addendum 5 
 
Protocol version date :  25Jul2018   
The serum free light chain (FLC) assay is of particular use in monitoring 
response to therapy in patients who have oligo-secretory or non- secretory disease 
and should be used in assessing response only  if the baseline serum and/or 
urine M proteins are not “measurable” as above, and the baseline level of 
the involved FLC is “measurable.”  When  using this assay, it is important to 
note that the FLC levels vary considerably with changes in renal function and in 
patients with renal insufficiency, the levels of both  the kappa and lambda may 
remain elevated, but the ratio normalizes with achievement of CR.  Thus, both the level of the involved and the uninvolved FLC isotype (i.e., the 
involved/uninvolved ratio or involved-uninvolved difference) should be considered in assessing response.  Patients included on the study on the basis of 
FLC alone (i.e., no measurable  serum/urine M -protein) should be the only 
ones who are evaluated using FLC response criteria.  The others should follow 
usual criteria and ignore FLC results with the exception of defining stringent 
complete response.  
 
• Evaluable disease : Patients who do not have a “measurable” serum M -
protein, serum free light chain, or urine M -protein. 
 
• Oligosecretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who  has NEVER 
had “measurable” serum M -protein or urine M -protein, but has had a 
detectable M-protein in his/her serum and/or urine and/or measurable serum 
free light chain.  
 
• Non-secretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER 
had a detectable M-protein in his/her serum and/or urine.

1  SPEP, UPEP, Immunofixation studies of both serum and urine , and Bone 
marrow biopsy  are required to document CR regardless of registration values, 
and in addition FLC measurement and bone marrow immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_324177].   SPEP and UPEP are required to document VGPR 
regardless of registration values.  
2  For serum measurable patients, 24 hour urine does not need to be confirmed 
(i.e. repeated after documented response) for any response category 
3  At a minimum, a bone marrow biopsy should be repeated every 3 months until 
documented response.  Bone marrow biopsy results do not need to be repeated 
after documented response.  
4    If serum M -protein is being followed by [CONTACT_324208], quantitative immunoglobulins are required .  SPEP is only required to document CR or VGPR.  
 
11.3 Confirmed response  
 
In order to be classified as a hematologic response, confirmation of serum M- 
protein, serum immunoglobulin free light chain (when primary determinant of 
response) and urine M- protein (when primary determinant of response) results 
must be made by [CONTACT_99964].   
• Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_324178], except for patients with evaluable disease only, where a bone 
marrow is required to document all response categories including 
progression. However, a second confirmatory bone marrow is not  
required to confirm response in any case. 
• Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response 
requirements; however, if radiographic studies were performed there 
should be no evidence of progressive or new bone lesions.  
 
Appropriate tests required to document and confirm response are listed in Table 
11.[ADDRESS_400253] be exercised to avoid rating progression on the basis of variation of radiologic technique alone.  Compression fracture does not exclude continued 
response and may  not indicate progression.  When progression is based on 
skeletal disease alone, it should be discussed with the Study Chair before 
removing the patient from the study.   
 11.5  Response and Progression  
 
Criteria for response and progression are listed in Table 11.5. Progressive disease for all patients as defined in Table 11.5.

11.5mg/dL) that can be attributed solely to the PC proliferative 
disorder  
Stable Disease (SD)  Not meeti ng criteria for sCR, CR, VGPR, PR , MR  or PD  
a All response categories require two consecutive assessments (sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR, PD) 
made at any time  before the institution of any new therapy; sCR, CR, VGPR,  PR, MR and SD 
categories also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response 
requirements. Bone marrow assessments need not be confirmed.  Each category, except for stable 
disease, will have a working subcategory of “unconfirmed” [prefix ‘u”] to designate first time 
point at which response category MAY have been achieved if confirmed.
 
 
b CR patient will need to progress at the same level as VGPR and PR patients to be considered a 
PD.  A positive immunofixation alone is not sufficient.  
c If more than one M protein spi[INVESTIGATOR_128716], then both 
need to be followed for response.  Otherwise, only follow t he measurable M protein spi[INVESTIGATOR_324179].   
 
d In patients in whom the only measurable disease is by [CONTACT_128758]: CR in such patients 
indicates a normal FLC ratio of 0.26-1.65 in addition to the CR criteria listed above. 
 
e Bone marrow criteria for PD are only to be used in patients without measurable disease by M 
protein and by [CONTACT_128759];  
 
f A "25% increase" refers to M protein, FLC and bone marrow results and does not refer to bone 
lesions, soft tissue plasmacytoma or hypercalcemia.  The lowest value do es not need to be a 
confirmed value.  If the lowest serum M -protein is ≥ 5 g/dL, an increase in serum M-protein of ≥ 
1 g/dL is sufficient to define disease progression. 
 
g In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (for example, a 
possible lab error), that value will not be considered when determining the lowest value.  
 
h Progressive disease should be confirmed.  However, treatment may be discontinued for 
progressive disease that is unconfirmed per physician discretion.  In this case, an objective status of PD should be entered on the measurement form and progressive disease should be reported on 
the event monitoring form. 
 
i Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the k/l ratio. An abnormal k/l ratio by 
[CONTACT_128760] a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is k/l of 4:1 or 1:2.  
 
j If a patient has already achieved a complete response prior to registration as a result of the 
induction therapy or stem cell transplant, the patient will be considered a continued complete response if they continue to meet the complete response criteria at the next assessment. 
Reconfirmation of complete response is not required.

14.4 Background and Methodology 
  
14.41 Minimal residual disease evaluation: Currently  30-40% of patients achieve a CR 
with initial therapy. In most cases, patients classified as CR in reality have 
minimal residual disease (MRD) since (i) many such patients relapse, and (ii) 
residual clonal disease is detectable in most by [CONTACT_324211]. (Sarasquete, Garcia-
Sanz et al. 2005 ; Mateo, Montalban et al. 2008 ; Paiva, Vidriales et al. 2009 ). We 
will determine minimal residual disease positivity at various stages of treatment, 
among patients achieving a conventional complete response. Bone marrow

 aspi[INVESTIGATOR_128721] a well as the ratio 
of clonal to non- clonal plasma cells after [ADDRESS_400257] detection will be done on BM samples as previously described32.  Plasma cells are identified by [CONTACT_324212]45/CD38/CD138 staining pattern with light cha in restriction and CD19/CD56 phenotype on each case. One ml 
(milliliter) of BM (bone marrow) is subjected to flow cytometry on a Cantos Flow Cytometer.  Samples are collected ungated, up to one million events per 
tube.  
 
14.42 Gene expression profiling. CD138- sorted MM tumors cells, and CD138 negative 
tumor microenvironment cell compartment, obtained from clinical bone marrow 
sampling, will  be banked before and after 12 cycles of therapy  as well as at the 
time of documented CR (CD138- only); high -resolution array -based gene 
expre ssion studies of paired (before/after) samples will be undertaken Samples 
will be analyzed using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays contain ing 
probes for 50,000 transcripts and variants including 14,500 known genes (U133 Plus 2- array; Af fymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using standard methods.
 
 
14.421  Sample Preparation, Fragmentation, Array Hy bridization, and Scanning:  
The puriﬁed cDNA is used as the template for in vitro transcription 
reaction for synthesizing biotinylated complementary RNA (cRNA) 
using an RNA transcript labeling reagent (Affymetrix). The quality of 
the frag mented biotin– labeled cRNA in each experiment is evaluated 
before hybridizing by [CONTACT_324213] (fraction of the sample) onto test -3 microarray and analyzing as a measure of 
quality control. Appropriate amounts of labeled cRNA and control 
oligonucleotide B2 are added along with control cRNA (BioB, BioC, 
BioD), herring sperm DNA, and bovine serum albumin to the 
hybridization buffer. The hybridization mixture is heated at 99°C for 5 
minutes followed by [CONTACT_324214] 45°C for 5 minutes before applying 
the sample onto the GeneChip. Hybridization is performed at 45°C for 16 hours with mixing, following which the solutions are removed, and 
arrays washed and stained with streptavidin -phycoerythrin (Molecular 
Probes, Portland, OR). After washes, probe arrays are scanned using the gene chip system confocal scanner. All samples will run individually 
with no pooling. 
 
14.422  Data Analysis and Interpretation:  The arrays will be scanned using a 
Genechip 300 scanner and GeneChip 5.0 software (Affymetrix) will used 
to quantitatively analyze the scanned image. Algorithms in the software 
use probe cell ﬂuorescence intensities to calculate an aver age intensity 
for each set of probe pairs representing a gene, which directly correlates with the amount of mRNA.  The plasma cell gene expression from different patient groups as described before will be compared using 
Genespring. The selection criteria for all genes re ported as differentially 
expressed will be as follows: (1) in absolute analysis, a detection call of present; (2) a change either increased or decreased; (3) signal of greater 
than 1,000; and (4) greater than 2-fold differences in expression in all 
MC128B 49  MCCC Addendum 5 
 
Protocol version date :  25Jul2018   
pair wise comparisons. Only genes with transcript levels that satis ﬁed all 
4 criteria will be considered as signiﬁcantly differentially expressed. 
Average differences in mean expression (as measured by ﬂuorescence 
intensity) of tran scripts that  met all of these criteria are compared across 
groups using the 2-sided Student’s t test. P values for differences 
between means of P less than .05 are consid ered statistically signiﬁcant . 
 
15.0 Drug Information  
 
15.1 Lenalidomide (Revlimid , CC-5013, CDC-501)    
 
Please consult the most current Investigator’s Brochure and package insert for 
complete drug information. 
 
15.11 Background : Lenalidomide has a wide range of effects, including the inhibition 
of hematopoietic tumor cell proliferation, the enhancement of T cells and natural 
killer (NK) cell activity, the modulation of stem cell differentiation, the inhibition 
of angiogenesis, and the inhibition of inflammation. 
 15.12 Formulation : For clinical study, lenalidomide is provided as 1.25-, 2.5-, 5-, 10-, 
15-, 20-, and 25- mg capsules for oral administration.  Each capsule contains 
lenalidomide as the active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients: anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and 
magnesium stearate.  
 
Placebo capsules for the 1.[ADDRESS_400258]. 
 
The lenalidomide and placebo capsules are supplied in push-through blister foil 
or tamper-evident, child- resistant, opaque, high -density polyethylene (HDPE) 
containers with HDPE caps.  A lenalidomide formulation for constitution to oral suspension is available for 
subjects who cannot swallow capsules and for subjects who participate in clinical 
studies; however, it is not commercially available. It is provided in an individually sealed 10 mL polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) vial with a 
chlorobutyl stopper sealed with an aluminum crimp seal and a flip-off cap. Each vial contains 80 mg of lenalidomide powder with no inactive ingredients. The 
lenalidomide powder in each vial is constituted with 8 mL of suspending vehicle 
(Flavor Blend flavored) to create a lenalidomide suspension with a final 
concentration of 10 mg/mL. 
 
15.13 Preparation and storage : Lenalidomide should be stored at room 
temperature, between 59 and 86ºF (15-30ºC).  Store drug away from direct sunlight.   
 
15.14 Administration:   Capsules are administered by [CONTACT_324215]. Patients 
should not bre ak, chew or open the capsules.  
 
MC128B 50  MCCC Addendum 5 
 
Protocol version date :  25Jul2018   
The suspension formulation is administered by [CONTACT_1966]. 
  
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : 
a) Absorption – Lenalidomide is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_324185] , with maximum plasma 
concentrations occurring between 0.[ADDRESS_400259]-dose. Co-administration 
with a high -fat and high -calorie meal in healthy subjects reduced the extent of 
absorption, resulting in an approximately 20% decrease in AUC and 50% decrease in C
max in plasma.  
 In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_324186], the drug was administered without regard to food 
intake. Thus, lenalidomide can be administered with or without food. 
 
Multiple dosing (up to 100 mg BID) did not cause marked drug accumulation.   
 
The bioavailability of the lenalidomide oral suspension (10 mg/mL, active 
pharmaceutical ingredient in Flavor Blend flavored suspending vehicle) was also evaluated in healthy subjects. The study demonstrated that the lenalidomide oral 
suspension is bioequivalent to the approved 25- mg capsule formulation at the 25 -
mg dose. A high- fat meal reduced the rate and extent of lenalidomide suspension 
absorption, resulting in an approximate 20% decrease in AUC, 57% decrease in 
Cmax, and 1.9-hour delay in tmax. 
 
 b) Distribution  – In vitro ( 14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is 
approximately 30%. 
 
c) Metabolism  – Lenalidomide undergoes limited metabolism. Unchanged 
lenalidomide is t he predominant circulating component in humans. Two 
identified metabolites are hydroxy -lenalidomide and N -acetyl -lenalidomide; each 
constitutes less than 5% of parent levels in circulation.  
 
d) Excretion – Elimination is primarily renal.  Approximately 65% to 85% 
of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through urinary excretion in 
subjects with normal renal function. The half- life of elimination is 
approximately 3 to 4 hours (2 to 3 hours in patients 5 to 21 years) at the clinically relevant doses (5 to 50 mg/day). Steady- state levels are achieved 
within 4 days.   
 
15.16 Potential Drug Interactions:  In vitro studies demonstrate that lenalidomide is 
not a substrate of CYP enzymes. In addition, lenalidomide shows little inhibitory 
or induction potential towards the CYP enzymes in vitro.  Hence, 
coadministration of CYP substrates, inhibitors, or inducers with lenalidomide is 
not likely to result in clinically relevant drug -drug interactions in humans.  
 
In vitro, lenalidomide is not a substrate of BCRP, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, OAT1, OAT3,  OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, OCTN1, or OCTN2. Thus, it is 
unlikely that substrates or  inhibitors of these transporters would affect 
lenalidomide disposition in humans. 
 
MC128B 51  MCCC Addendum 5 
 
Protocol version date :  25Jul2018   
Lenalidomide is not an inhibitor of BSEP, BCRP, MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT2. Thus, lenalidomide is not anticipated to cause 
any significant drug-drug interactions due to inhibition of these transporters. 
 Lenalidomide is not an inhibitor of UGT1A1 and is not anticipated to cause any 
significant  drug-drug interactions due to UGT1A1 inhibition. 
 
In vitro, lenalidomide is a weak substrate, but not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp). 
 
Erythropoietic agents or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives, should be used 
with caution in patients with multiple myeloma receiving lenalidomide with 
dexamethasone.  
  Periodic monitoring of digoxin plasma levels is recommended due to increased 
C
max and AUC with concomitant lenalidomide therapy.  Close monitoring of PT 
and INR is recommended in multiple myeloma patients taking concomitant warfarin.  
 
 
15.17  Known potential toxicities :   
 Pregnancy Warning: Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, caused limb 
abnormalities in a developmental monkey study simi lar to birth defects caused by 
[CONTACT_324216]. If lenalidomide is used during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out.  .  Pregnancy must be 
excluded before start of treatment. Prevent pregnancy during treatment  by [CONTACT_324217].

15.2 LDE225  Sonidegib (LDE225, Odomzo®)   
 
15.21 Background :  Sonidegib ( LDE225 ) is a potent antagonist of Hedgehog (Hh)- 
and Smoothened (Smo) -dependent signaling. Smo is a G protein-coupled 
receptor  (GPCR) -like molecule that positively regulates the Hh signal 
transduction pathway.  Hh pathway activation at or upstream of Smo is linked to 
the pathogenesis of several types of cancer .   
  In particular, activating mutations in Hh pathway genes have been identified in 
patients with medulloblastoma (MB), basal cell carcinoma (B CC), and 
rhabdomyosarcoma. Aberrant upregulation of the Hh pathway without known mutation is linked to the pathogenesis of many other cancer types including 
pancreatic breast, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, glioblastoma, ovarian, sarcoma, 
acute and chronic leukemias, multiple myeloma, lymphoma and small -cell lung 
cancer (SCLC). Antagonists of Smo are hypothesized to block the growth of 
tumors that are dependent on Hh pathway activation. Furthermore, preclinical 
and emerging clinical data suggests Hh signaling may play an important role in 
many hematological cancers, such as acute and chronic leukemia, multiple 
myeloma and lymphomas. 
    15.22 Formulation : Hard gelatin capsules contain LDE225  drug substance at dose 
strength of 200 mg,  with the following excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: crospovidone, lactose  
monohydrate, magnesium stearate, poloxamer 188, silica colloidal 
anhydrous/colloidal silicon dioxide and sodium l aurilsulfate/sodium lauryl 
sulfate. The capsule  uses a size 00    pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745] (“Swedish Orange”) opaque capsule 
shell  with either no imprint or with “NVR” imprinted in black ink on the cap and 
“SONIDEGIB 200MG” in black ink on the body. The capsule shell contains 
gelatin, red iron oxide and titanium dioxide.  
 
Immediate -release film -coated tablets contain 200 mg sonidegi b drug substance 
(based on free base content), with the following excipi[INVESTIGATOR_324187]: 
cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, hypromellose, magnesium 
stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, silicon dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodi um 
starch glycolate and talc. The film -coating contains black, red, and yellow iron 
oxides, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc and titanium dioxide. The tablets are reddish to pale red in color with an ovaloid shape, a beveled edge, and 
“CC” engr aved on one side and “NVR” on the other side. 
 
An oral suspension has been established at the dose strength of 50 mg sonidegib 
per mL (based on free base content) for adult and pediatric use in the medulloblastoma indication (refer to Study CLDE225A2114 for relative

Protocol version date :  25Jul2018   
bioavailability relative to the capsule in healthy volunteers and Study 
CLDE225C2301 for patient experience). The oral suspension is prepared in- situ 
at the clinical sites, yielding a white homogenous s uspension. The clinical sites 
are supplied with sonidegib powder for oral suspension, which is packaged in 
amber glass bottles with a white child -resistant cap. The white to practically 
white powder contains sonidegib drug substance with the following commonly 
used compendial grade excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, 
microcrystalline cellulose, sucralose (or E955) and Tutti Frutti dry flavor. 
Additionally, 80 ml of a Solvent for oral suspension (a clear solution of medium-
chain trigly cerides) is supplied packaged in amber glass bottles with a white 
child -resistant cap. (Each bottle contains a 20 ml overfill to permit the complete 
withdrawal of the 60 ml nominal volume from the bottle). Oral dosing syringes are provided to enable accurate preparation and dispensing of the reconstituted 
suspension. The packaging materials employed are commonly used in 
commercial products.  
  
15.23 Preparation and storage : The
 Capsules are packaged in high density 
polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with an induction seal and child- resistant 
closure, with desiccant. Please refer to the clinical label for the current 
shelf -life, in -use period and storage conditions.  
 
[COMPANY_001] provides a kit composed of an amber bottle with sonidegib 
powder for oral suspension, an amber glass bottle with solvent for oral 
suspension, and a dosing syringe to prepare the oral suspension.  The 
instructions for use describe reconstitution of the powder at the study site by [CONTACT_8786].  Patients receive reconstituted oral suspension in 
multiple -use bottles, and dosing syringes for daily administration.  A 
second instruction for use describes drug dosing at home.  As the shelf- life 
and storage conditions of both the sonidegib powder and the solvent for 
oral suspension will be continually assessed based on accelerated and long 
term stability data, please refer to the clinical label for current shelf -life, 
in-use and storage conditions. 
 
Sonidegib is considered a teratogenic agent. Great care must be taken 
when handling dosage forms of sonidegib, especially while pregnant. Due 
to the physical properties of sonidegib drug substance and dosage forms, 
sonidegib can neither be inhaled nor absorbed through the skin. Therefore hands should be washed thoroughly with soap and water upon direct 
exposure to sonidegib.  
   
15.24 Administration:   LDE225 capsules should be taken once daily, at approximately 
the same time each day . 
 LDE225 should be taken as follows: 
Patients should be instructed to take their once- a day dose at approximately the 
same time each day  [ADDRESS_400267] (eg. juice, toast and jam). Food 
intake should be avoided for at least 1 hour after study drug administration.  
MC128B 56  MCCC Addendum 5 
 
Protocol version date :  25Jul2018   
Patients should follow the administration instructions on the clini cal label and the 
instructions for use that accompany the sonidegib suspension.  
 
• On days where PK samples need to be collected prior to taking study drug, 
that day’s dose should be taken in the clinic (study site) 
• Each daily dose of LDE225 should be taken with a glass of water and 
consumed over as short a time as possible (e.g. 1 capsule every 2 minutes)  
• Patients should be instructed to swallow capsules whole and to not chew or open them 
• Each daily dose of LDE225 (including days which involve PK blood sampl ing) should be taken [ADDRESS_400268] (e.g., consisting of 
juice, toast and jam). If breakfast was completed at 08:00 a.m., then study 
drug administration should occur at 10:[ADDRESS_400269] 1 hour after study drug administration 
• Patients must avoid grapefruit, pomegranate, star fruit and Seville (sour) oranges during the entire study. The juices and products containing these

• If vomiting occurs during the course of the treatment, t hen no re -dosing of 
the patient is allowed before the next scheduled dose  
• If the patient forgets to take his/her daily morning dose, then he/she should 
take LDE225 within [ADDRESS_400270] passed, then that day’s dose  should be omitted and the patient should 
continue treatment with the next scheduled dose  
• Patients should inform the investigational site staff of any missed or delayed dose 
  
15.25 Pharmacokinetic information : 
     Absorption and Distribution – Median time to Tmax occurs at 2 -4 hours 
(range 1 -48 hrs).  Tmax appeared to be independent of dose.  Steady state 
for sonidegib is anticipated to be reached after [ADDRESS_400271], food consumption will continue to be restricted around the time of 
dosing for clinical studies. Sonidegib is  highly bound (>97%) to human 
plasma proteins.  
Metabolism: The metabolite profile in plasma shows unchanged sonidegib as the major circulating component (36%).  The main circulating 
metabolite (M48) is pharmacologically inactive as an inhibitor of 
Smoothened receptor. Sonidegib is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 in 
the liver.  
 Excretion – Excretion is almost exclusively through feces (88.7% of dose 
and as unchanged), with no detectable levels in the urine. The median half -life is approximately 28 days.

Protocol version date :  25Jul2018   
15.26 Potential Drug Interactions:  LDE225 is shown to potently inhibit 
CYP2B6 and CYP2C9. Because of the potential risk for drug-drug 
interactions, using concomitant medications known to be metabolized by 
[CONTACT_324219]  (CYP2B6: buproprion, 
efavirenz , cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, thiotepa, procarbazine ; 
CYP2C9: celecoxib,  diclofenac, tolbutamide, warfarin, tamoxifen, 
phenytoin) should be carefully monitored or excluded, in accordance with 
protocol-specific guidelines. 
 
Precaution should be taken when LDE225 is administered with any known 
potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers , as these have the potential to 
influence the  biotransformation and clearance of LDE225. See 3.[ADDRESS_400272] cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in vitro. 
Therefore  substrates, especially those with a narrow therapeutic range, 
should be used with caution.  BCRP substrates include zidovudine, pantoprazole, cimetidine, sulfasalazine, nitrofuratoin, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, topotecan, imatinib, and irinotecan or “statins”.  
 15.27 Known potential toxicities:   Based on its mechanism of action and the 
results of the pre- clinical toxicology studies, the  major potential toxicities 
of LDE225 in humans are anticipated to be the following: thinning or early closure of growth plates, in growing children; disruption of gametogenesis 
and impairment of the development of reproductive organs with resultant 
infertility; and gastrointestinal  irritation with potential mucosal damage. 
LDE225 is a teratogen, as are other Smo inhibitors, in view of the role of Hh signaling in embryo-fetal development. In addition, the emerging 
clinical data has revealed dose- limiting toxicities characterized by [CONTACT_324220]/or muscle spasms,  rhabdomyolysis being a serious adverse event.  
 
The following adverse reactions occur at a frequency of   ≥10%: 
 Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite, weight decreased  
 Nervous system disorder: Dysgeusia, headache, insomnia, dizziness  
 Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting  
 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Alopecia, pruritus  Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, asthenia  
 Reproductive system and breast disorders: amenorrhea  
 General disorders: Fatigue, pain, cough, UTI, lethargy, pain in extremity, 
pyrexia, dyspnea, lipase increased  
 
 The following adverse reactions occur at a frequency of 1-10%: 
 Metabolism and  nutrition disorders: Dehydration 
 Gastrointestinal disorders: Dyspepsia, constipation, gastroesophageal 
reflux disorder 
 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: Rash, abnormal hair growth  Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myopathy (muscular  
fatigue and muscular weakness)  
MC128B 58  MCCC Addendum 5 
 
Protocol version date :  25Jul2018   
  
 Other reported serious adverse reactions include febrile neutropenia, 
anemia, blood glucose increased, gastritis, myositis, myoglobin blood 
increased, hypersensitivity, and acute renal failure.  Adverse events 
occurred ba sed on lab abnormalities: hemoglobin decreased, lymphocyte 
count decreased, serum creatinine increased, serum creatine 
phosphokinase (CK) increased, blood glucose increased, lipase increased, 
alanine amino transaminase (ALT) increased, aspartate amino 
transaminase (AST) increased, amylase increased.  
  Routine safety monitoring will include physical examinations (including  
vital signs), hematology, serum chemistries, coagulation tests, urinalyses, 
cardiac monitoring, as well as bone monitoring in pediatric patients. In 
particular, the main dose- limiting toxicities  observed in the clinic relate to 
muscle toxicity that is characterized with plasma CK elevation,  increased 
plasma myoglobin, muscle spasms, myalgia and muscular weakness. 
Therefore,  close monitoring of plasma CK levels during the first 8 weeks 
of LDE225 therapy is recommended .  
 
15.28 Drug procurement:  Drug will be provided free of charge to study participants 
by [CONTACT_5343] . 
 
15.29 Nursing Implications : 
 
15.[ADDRESS_400273] exposure to LDE225 powder occurs, the hands should be washed 
thoroughly with soap and water. 
15.292 Assess patient’s concomitant medications. Care should be exercised 
when administering with agents that utilize the CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and 
CYP3A4 pathways as there is the potential for drug -to drug interactions, 
especially those with a low therapeutic index (see section 15.16). 
15.293 Given the very early investigational nature of this agent, not all side 
effects can be known at this time. Assess patients regularly and report 
side effects to the study team.  
15.294 Based on preclinical studies, there is the possible risk of infertility, warn 
patients of this possibility.

16.0  Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
 
16.1  Overview:   
 This is a Phase II study designed to assess the proportion of complete responses as well as the toxicity associated with Lenalidomide and LDE225 used as maintenance therapy 
following autologous stem cell transplantation. 
 
16.11  Primary Endpoint :  
 The primary endpoint of this trial is the rate of complete response. Throughout 
Section 16.0, complete response will be considered synonymous with “success”, 
unless specified otherwise.  All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have 
signed a conse nt form and have begun treatment will be evaluable for complete 
response, with the exception of patients who are determined to be a major 
treatment violation.  
 
16.2  Statistical Design : 
 
16.21 Decision Rule:  
 
 In a Mayo Clinic database study that captured data prospectively into a 
continuously updated database, 178 multiple myeloma patients received a stem 
cell transplant within 12 months of diagnosis.( Kumar, Lacy et al. 2011 ) The 
complete response rate to stem cell transplant was 35%.  Since patients in this 
study will receive a stem cell transplant within 12 months of diagnosis, an 
increase in complete response rate to greater than 35%  with the addition of 
maintenance therapy with lenalidomide and LDE225 would be of interest.  
 
 The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen would be 
considered ineffective in this population is 35%, and the smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient population is 55 %.  The following one -stage binomial design uses [ADDRESS_400276] 35%.   
 
  
MC128B 60  MCCC Addendum 5 
 
Protocol version date :  25Jul2018   
16.211 Final Decision Rule: If [ADDRESS_400277] 18, this will be considered evidence of promising 
activity, and the treatment may be recom mended for further testing in 
subsequent studies.  
16.212 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_128724].  Analyses involvi ng over accrued 
patients are discussed in Section 16.34. 
 
16.22  Sample Size :  
 The single stage study design to be used is fully described in section 16.21.  A maximum of 39 evaluable patients will be accrued onto this phase II study unless 
undue toxicity  is encountered.  We anticipate accruing an additional 4 patients to 
account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other reasons.  
Maximum projected accrual is 43 patients.  
 
16.23  Accrual Rate and Study Duration :  
 The anticipated  accrual rate is approximately [ADDRESS_400278] 6 months.  
  
16.24 Power and Significance Level: Assuming that the number of responses is 
binomially distributed, with a significance level of 10%, the probability of declaring that the regimen warrants further studies (i.e., statistical power) under 
various success proportions can be tabulated as a function of the true success 
proportion as shown in the table below.  
 
If the true success proportion is…  0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 
Then the probability of declaring that the regimen is 
promising and warrants further study is…  0.10 0.27 0.50 0.74 0.90 
 
16.25 Other Considerations: Toxicity, quality/duration of response, and patterns of 
treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or changes in standard care will be taken into account in any decision to terminate the study. 
 16.3 Analysis Plan:  The analysis for this trial will commence at planned timepoints (see 16.2) 
and at the time the patients have become evaluable f or the primary endpoint. Such a 
decision will be made by [CONTACT_31957], in accord with CCS Standard 
Operating Procedures, availability of data for secondary endpoints (eg, laboratory 
correlates), and the level of data maturity. It is anticipated that the earliest date in which 
the results will be made available via manuscript, abstract, or presentation format is when 
last patient has been followed for at least 6 months.

Protocol version date :  25Jul2018   
16.31  Primary Endpoint :   
 
16.311 Definition: The primary endpoint of th is trial is the rate of complete 
response. A complete response is defined as a CR noted as the objective 
status on [ADDRESS_400279] begun treatment will be evaluable for response, with the exception of patients who are determined to be a major treatment violation.  
 
16.312 Estimation:  The proportion of successes will be estimated by [CONTACT_128771]. Exact 
binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be 
calculated.  
 
16.32 Definitions and Analyses of Secondary Endpoint:  
 
16.321 Overall survival:  Survival time is defin ed as the time from SCT to death 
due to any cause.  The distribution of survival time will be estimated 
using the method of Kaplan- Meier (Kaplan and Meier, 1958).  All 
evaluable patients will be included in this analysis.   In addition, overall 
survival tim e from the time of registration will also be evaluated.  
 
16.322 Progression- free survival:  The progression- free survival time is defined 
as the time from SCT to progression or death due to any cause.  The 
distribution of progression- free survival will be estimated using the 
method of Kaplan- Meier  (Kaplan and Meier 1958) .  The progression- free 
survival rates at [ADDRESS_400280] will be assessed.   In 
addition, progression- free survival from the time of registration will also 
be evaluated.  
 
16.323 Adverse Events : The maximum grade for each type of adverse event, 
regardless of causality, will be recorded and reported for each patient, 
and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine adverse event patterns.  Adverse events will continue to be recorded and reported 
through the observation period, or up to [ADDRESS_400281] binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true MRD negative rate will be calculated.

16.34 Over Accrual:  If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patie nts will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_177062]; however, they will be included in final point 
estimates and confidence intervals.  
 
16.35 Data & Safety Monitoring  
 
16.351 Safety Analysis:  The trial will initially open  to only [ADDRESS_400282] 3 months of treatment.   
 
 Safety Analysis Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] R ule:  If 0 or 1 patients experience a DLT, the 
study will be reopened to accrual.  If 2 or more patients experience a DLT, the study team will review all adverse events and determine 
whether study will be closed or reopened with adjustments to the starting  
dose level s as outlined in Table 8.1.  
 
For this protocol, dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as an 
adverse event attributed (definitely, probably, or possibly) to the study treatment during the first 3 cycles of treatment and meeting the followi ng 
criteria:  
 Toxicity (CTCAE v 4.0) DLT Definition  
 
Toxicity  (CTCAE v3.0)  DLT Definition*  
Hematologic  Grade 4 ANC for ≥7 days  or PLT <25,000 for ≥7 
days 
Infection  Grade 4  
Febrile Neutropenia  Defined as fever ≥ 38.5oC (38 > 1 hour) with grade 
≥ 3 neutropenia  
CK elevation  >  Grade 3 CK elevation  
Other Non -hematologic  ≥ grade 3 as per NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0**.  
 
*Any toxicities that caused dose delay of > 2 weeks of the intended next dose will 
also be considered dose- limiting.  
**Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea with maximal supportive treatment(s) will 
be considered dose-limiting.  Fatigue and mouth sores that are considered Grade 3 
with an attributio n of definitely, probably, or possibly related to treatment will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_324221] (i.e. disease progression or infection) or treatment.   If it is determined that the fatigue 
or mouth sores were due to other causes they would not be considered a DLT and if they were due to treatment they would be considered a DLT.

16.352 The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the 
study at least every quarter to identify accrual, adverse event, and any 
endpoint problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clinic Cancer 
Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible 
for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twice a year, 
based on reports provided by [CONTACT_31959].  
 
16.353 Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020]: The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_324188].  We note that 
the rule may be adjusted in the event of either (1) the study re-opening to 
accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of the trial and in 
consideration of newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the treatments under investigation.  The study team may 
choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event profiles 
that have not crossed the specified rule below.  
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe 
events considered at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse event with attribute specified as “possible,” “probable,” or “definite”) that satisfy 
either of the following:  
 
• if [ADDRESS_400283] possibly related to 
treatment.  
 
• if after the first [ADDRESS_400284] been treated, 25% of all patients 
experience a grade [ADDRESS_400285] 
possibly related to treatment.  
 
We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence 
of a previously unrecognized treatment- related adverse event.  
 
 
16.4 Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov: At study activation, this study will have been 
registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
along with other required information for this study will be reported on 
Clinica lTrials.gov. For purposes of timing of the Results Reporting, the initial estimated 
completion date for the Primary Endpoint of this study is 2 years after the study opens to accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion Date” (PECD) for this study is at the time the last patient registered has been followed for at least [ADDRESS_400286].  Therefore, although the planned analysis will, as

always, look for differences in treatment effect based on racial and gender 
groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839], the sample size is not increased in order to provide additional power 
for subset analyses.  
 16.53 The geographical region served by [CONTACT_31953], has a population which includes 
approximately 3% minorities. Based on prior Mayo studies involving similar 
disease sites, we expect about 3 -5% of patients will be classified as minorities by

Prohibited concomitant medications  
 
Strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers  
No clinical studies have been performed to confirm if LDE225 is a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, hence 
concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers is not permitted. Patients receiving 
concomitant medications known to strongly inhibit and/or induce CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_400291] of drugs that are inducers, and inhi bitors of 
CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_400292]  of medications has been generated by [CONTACT_324223] (OncCP)  (DDI database document: last update August 2010) that is compi[INVESTIGATOR_324193] “draft guidance for industry, drug interaction studies, CDER 
2006”, Indiana University School of Medicine drug interaction tables at 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/DDIs/ClinicalTable, and “drug interaction from University of 
Washington. Patients should be instructed not to take grapefruit, St John Wort or Seville (sour) orange 
juice while receiving LDE225 treatment throughout the study due to potential CYP3A4/5 inhibition. The other drugs without an asterisk should be carefully used as concomitant therapy.

*- Known strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 are estimated to cause a≥ 5 fold increase in the AUC values or a 
≥80% decrease in clearance of  a CYP3A4 substrate;   
& -a moderate inhibitor is estimated to cause a ≥2-but < 5 fold increase in the AUC values or a 50 -80% decrease 
in the clearance of a sensitive substrate when the inhibitor is given at the highest approved dose.  
** -Known strong inducers of CYP3A4/5 (AUC decrease by 50 -80%)  
Medications that are CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 substrates (narrow therapeutic index) 
LDE225 is a potent inhibitor of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_324224]2B6 and CYP2C9 in vitro . 
Because of the potential risk for drug- drug interactions, using concomitant medications known to be 
metabolized by [CONTACT_324225] (see  table below ) is not permitted in the 
study. The other drugs without an  asterisk should be carefully used as concomitant therapy.

&- statins – If it is essential that the patient takes a statin to control hyperlididemia [see Section [IP_ADDRESS]], then only 
pravastatin  may be used with extra caution.  Pravastatin has the lowest potential of cause rhabdomyolysis 
compared with other statins  (3 cases/ 6 millions of prescription from 1994 to 2002)  (Evans et al. 2002) and the 
lowest risk for drug-drug interactions with LDE225, as it is primarily transformed in the liver cytosol by [CONTACT_324227], 
not by [CONTACT_097]2C9 or CYP3A4. ( Evans et al. 2002) 
  
Warfarin and coumadin derivatives  
Therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium (Coumadin®) or any other coumadin- derivative anticoagulants are 
not permitted since LDE225 is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9 based on the in vitro  data. An 
alternative, therapeutic anticoagulation may be accomplished  using low -molecular weight heparin. 
 Drugs that may increase risk of rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly with LDE225  
Selected drugs that may increase risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly with 
LDE225 should be avoided. Such drugs should be discontinued for at least [ADDRESS_400293] compi[INVESTIGATOR_324196] -drug interaction with LDE225 through inhibitory effects on 
CYP3A4  
 (enzyme metabolized  LDE225) or the inhibitory effect on CYP2C9 by [CONTACT_324228]225 of drugs that may induced rhabdomyolysis. 
• Azoles  antifungals:   Itraconazole, ketoconazole,  fluconazole,  voriconazole 
• Macrolides:   azithromycin,  clarithromycin,  erythromycin,  telitromycin 
• Fibrates: gemfibrozil  
• 3-hydroxy- 3 methyl -glutaryl (HMG) Coa reductase inhibitors ( Statins): Atovastatin, 
Fluvastatin, Fluvastatin XL, Lovastatin, Pravastatin*,  Rosuvastatin-  and Simvastatin  
• Antiretrovirals: Indonavir and ritonavir 
Others: phenobarbital, barbiturates,  phenytoin and isoniazid 
 * If it is essential that the patient stays on a statin to control hyperlididemia [see Section [IP_ADDRESS]], only 
pravastatin may be used with extra caution; CK should be monitored weekly during the first 8 weeks on 
concomitant treatment with LDE225 and then bi- weekly thereafter for 8 weeks and then every four weeks

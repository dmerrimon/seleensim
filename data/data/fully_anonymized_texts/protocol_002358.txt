Primary Objectives  1. To determine the prevalence of TGNB persons undergoing 
chest masculinization surgery who have an elevated lifetime 
risk of breast cancer development and prevalenc e of those who 
undergo genetic counseling.  
2. To determine whether those TGNB persons at  elevated risk of 
breas t cancer development choose to undergo risk -reducing 
mastectomies as part of their chest masculinization surgery . 
3. To assess and compare the self -perceived breast cancer risk 
with calculated risk . 
Primary Endpoints  1. The percentage of all participants undergoing chest 
masculinization surgery who are at elevated lifetime risk of BC development (i.e., >17% ) and those who undergo genetic 
counseling. Lifetime BC risk will be estimated utilizing the Gail and IBIS models.
 
2. The percentage of those participants  with moderate to high 
lifetime BC risk or pathogenic germline variant that  say they 
would choose to undergo a risk -reducing mastectom y. 
3. The accuracy of self -perceived BC risk, as measured by [CONTACT_534089] (VAS),  and the personalized BC risk 
assessment taken after the VAS.  
Main Eligibility Criteria  • ≥18 years old.  
• Assigned female or intersex at birth and identify as non-
cisgender.  
• Considering undergoing gender -affirming chest masculinization 
surgery . 
• Ability to communicate in English.  
• Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it.  
Study Design  Prospective, single- arm interventional pi[INVESTIGATOR_534066] a breast cancer risk assessment, genetic  testing (when 
applicable), and surgical oncologist consultation can inform those 
TGNB patients at elevated risk for breast cancer development to

The population of transgender and nonbinary persons (TGNB) in Wisconsin and the [LOCATION_002]

for cisgender women is approx imately 13% for a person who lives to be age  85 years in the United 
States.19, 20 A person’s lifetime risk of BC development may be dramatically impacted by a family 
history of BC, increased breast density, a personal  history of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_97548], lobular

Risk Evaluation Tool (also called IBIS)  that incorporate personal history ( e.g., first age at

37-43 Both models provide a 
percent estimate of a person’s lifetime risk compared to the average women (ex: 35% lifetime risk 
for a person compared to 12.5% for average risk peer).  Cisgender women with a moderate lifetime

enhanced BC screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or risk -reducing medications 
such as tamoxifen or raloxifene.45-49 Those with a high lifetime BC risk,  defined as >30%,44 can

to undergo chest masculinization surgery ± risk-reducing mastectomies.  Given that an increa sing 
number of TGNB persons are undergoing gender -affirming chest masculinization surgery and 
that no data exists on the operation’s ability to reduce the incidence of BC, a clear opportunity 
exists to perform routine personalized BC risk assessment ( ± genetic testing) prior to chest

from undergoing oncologic risk -reducing mastectomies as part of their gender -affirming chest

The Froedtert  & MCW  Inclusion Health Clinic  opened in July 2018  and is located on the 
Milwaukee Regional Medical Center  grounds  within the Sargeant Health Center. The clinic is 
focused on providing health care for LGBTQ + individuals. S ervices include primary and 
preventive care,  obstetrics and gynecology,  HIV prevention, gender -affirming care , and 
psychiatric care. The clinics are the only ones of its kind in Wisconsin and in the 2020- 2021 fiscal 
year, cared for >1,600 individual patients, of which >600 identify as tran sgender. The unique 
relation with the Inclusion Health Clinic, the Southeastern Wisconsin LGBTQ+ community, and a  
skilled Plastic Surgery team allow for a unique opportunity to conduct this investigation.  
1.2 Rationale  
The goals of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_534068] 1) determine the percent of TGNB persons undergoing chest 
masculinization surgery who have an elevated lifetime risk of BC development (>17%) or  a 
pathogenic genetic mutation that increased the risk of BC development (BRCA1/2, ATM, etc .), 2) 
measur e the percent who are at risk and say they would choose to undergo risk -reducing 
mastectomies as part of chest masculinization surgery, and 3) assess and compare self -
perceived BC risk with calculated risk. The results of this study will substantially inform TGNB 
patients and surgeons on the utility of personalized BC risk assessment prior to chest 
masculinization surgery and the accuracy of self -perceived BC risk in TGNB persons. This project  
has the potential to set a new standard of care that all TGNB pe rsons should undergo a 
personalized BC risk assessment prior to gender -affirming surgery.

6.0 STUDY DESIGN , PROCEDURES,  AND MEASUREMENTS  
6.1 Overview of the Study Design Workflow  
 
*Activities that occur after the personalized BC risk assessment are participant 
choice, standard practice, and will be collected as part of study data.  
6.2 Visit 1: Breast Cancer Risk Assessment , Risk Categorization, and Initial 
Counseling  
Participants will be scheduled within 60 days of initial screening and consent to undergo a 
personalized BC risk assessment utilizing the Gail and IBIS tools, which are both validated and widely used asses sment s.
37-43 During Visit 1 , participants will identify their self -perceived lifetime 
BC ris k on the Visual Analog Scale ( Appendix 1 ) as part of the initial study intake , which will also 
acquire identifiable patient data (name, date of birth , and medical record number)  and 
demographic information (race, ethnicity, age, sex assigned at birth, gender, etc; see Section 6.[ADDRESS_693682] of data factors to be collected). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_534072], APNP will enter 
the risk estimates from the  Gail ( https://ibis.ikonopedia.com ) and IBIS

For participants <35  years old, in which Gail is not validated, only the IBIS lifetime BC risk will be 
used, and a mean lifetime risk will not  be calculated.  
Participants with an average lifetime BC risk, defined as ≤17%,44 will be recommended to 
continue their gender -affirming operation as planned and will not be scheduled for a second visit.   
Those with a moderate  lifetime BC risk, defined as 17 -30%, will be counseled on their elevated 
risk and the option to consider risk -reducing mastectomies as part of their gender -affirming chest 
masculinization operation. This option will be provided for moderate- risk persons, given the 
unclear long- term BC risk reduction from chest masculinization surgery alone. Moderate risk 
individuals will also be counseled on standard risk -reducing strategies, including lifestyle 
modifications, risk -reducing endocrine therapy options, and increased breast cancer screening 
strategies.  
Participants with a high lifetime  BC risk, defined as >30%, will b e counseled on the potential 
benefit of undergoing risk -reducing mastectomies as part of their gender -affirming chest 
masculinization operation, an also be counseled on standard risk- reducing strategies , including 
lifestyle modifications, risk -reducing endocrine therapy options, and increased breast cancer 
screening strategies . 
Those participants with an elevated lifetime risk based on family history, or with an unknown family 
history (per NCCN guidelines) will be offered to meet with a Genetic counselor to  consider genetic 
study  (see Section 6.3 ). 
Those with a moderate or high risk and/or family history suggestive of pathogenic variant who decline further genetic testing or a [ADDRESS_693683] Cancer Genetic Testing  
Study participants with a family history suggestive of a pathogenic variant and/or with an elevated 
BC risk who meet NCCN genetic testing guidelines  (Appendix 2 )1, 2 will be referred to the Cancer 
Genetics  Clinic to undergo a formal genetic counseling session and possible germline genetic 
testing. Genetic testing will be performed  via the Ambry Genetic s® Panel, which is our current 
institution standard.  
Persons who undergo genetic testing and are found to have a pathogenic variant for BC will be offered to see the PI, Chandler Cortina, MD, to discuss the utility of risk -reducing mastectomies 
as part of their chest masculinization operation (see Visit 2). Persons who are found to have a 
pathogenic variant that infers any other risk besides BC will be referred to the appropriate care teams for further evaluation, as is the current standard practice in our Genetics clinic.

Participants considering risk -reducing mastectomies will meet directly with [CONTACT_534102]  who can 
perform the operation in tandem with the patient’s respective plastic surgeon. Patients who 
decline risk -reducing mastectomy as part of their surgery will be given the opportunity to express 
why they declined.  This procedure is  consistent with the  current clinical workflow for cisgender 
patients.  If patients undergo risk -reducing mastectomy as part of their chest masculinization 
surgery, pathological tissue examination is standard and findings will be collected during the study 
period.

8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS: DEF INITIONS, COLLECTION, AND 
REPORTING  
This study is  considered to be  of minimal risk to participants due to its design and the nature of 
the intervention being tested ( i.e., risk assessment, genetic testing, and patient education). As 
described in Section 11.5.1 , participants may experience anxiety or distress upon hearing the 
results of their personalized BC risk assessment and/or their genetic tests. 
Subjects will not undergo an investigational medical intervention for the purposes of this study. While the participants’ decision to have risk -reducing mastectomies performed in tandem with 
their gender -affirming chest masculinization procedure will be assessed, t he risk -reducing 
mastectomy procedure itself or its outcomes does not fall under this study protocol. For these 
reasons, adverse and ser ious adverse events are not expected, but will be defined, collected, and 
reported as described in this section if encountered.  
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical investigation  subject administered an 
interventional product  and which does not  necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  
This study will utilize the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
5.0, located on the CTEP web site:  
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
 
AEs may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_127205]/or in response to an open question from 
study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other diagnostic procedures . 
BC Risk Assessment  19 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 8.1.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
• Death.  Results in death.  
• Life- threatening . Is life -threatening (refers to an AE in which the participant  was at risk of 
death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ≥24 hours or prolongation of an 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Disability/incapacity. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
(Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions).  
• Pregnancy 
• Medically important  event . This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant , require 
medical or surgical i ntervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or involves 
suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.  
8.1.3  Attribution of an Adverse Event  
An assessment of the relationship between the adverse event and the medical intervention, using 
the following categories:  
• Definitely Related: The AE is clearly related to the intervention.  There is clear evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship, and othe r possible contributing factors can be ruled out.  
• Probably Related:  The AE is likely related to the intervention. There is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely.  
• Possibly Related: The AE may be related to the intervention. There is some evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after 
administration of the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors may have 
contributed to the event (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant events).  
• Unlikely:  The AE is doubtfully related to the intervention. A clinical event, including an 
abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal relationship to drug administration 
makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a 
reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in which other drugs or 
chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the subject’s 
clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
BC Risk Assessment  20 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 • Unrelated: The AE is clearly NOT related to the intervention.  The AE is completely 
independent of study drug administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is 
definitely related to another etiology.  
8.1.4  Expectedness of an Adverse Event  
Study Investigator or treating physician will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected as indicated in the protocol, informed consent form and/or drug 
information brochure. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency 
of the event is NOT consistent with the risk information previously described for the study 
intervention.  
8.2 Collection and Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Adverse and serious adverse events are not expected, but if such events occur, they will be reported per IRB guidelines. Any events reported to the IRB will be reported to the DSMC following the same manner (routine or expedited).  
For routine reporting, the events will be reported to the IRB as part of the annual continuing progress report, and the DSMC will review events entered into OnCore
™ at the time of scheduled 
monitoring.  
For expedited DSMC reporting, the study coordinator/research nurse must notify the DSMC via 
email. For AEs, include the subject ID, date of event, grade, relatedness, expectedness, and a 
short narrative. For SAEs, DSMC will review the SAE report entered into the secure Microsoft Excel spreadsheet used for the study.  
8.[ADDRESS_693686] or Other (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961])  
Unanticipated problems will be submitted to IRB of record and the DSMC, according to local 
policies and procedures. An unanticipated problem is one that is unexpected, possibly, probably, 
or definitely related to the research described in the paragraph above, and suggests the research places research participants or others at a greater risk of physical or psychological harm than was 
previously known or recognized.  
Since this is an investigator -initiated study, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_534074]. The study investigators and 
coordinators follow participants per the schedule of events outlined in the Study Calendar
 to 
ensure protocol compliance, participant safety, and quality care. Any unanticipated problems 
detected will be promptly documented by [CONTACT_534091] 5 calendar days of study staff’s knowledge. These reviews would pi[INVESTIGATOR_534075].  
8.[ADDRESS_693687] Complaints  
If a complaint is received by [CONTACT_534092], it will be discussed with the study staff and will be addressed on a case- by-case basis. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_534076]. Complaints 
will be reported to the IRB if indicated.

Medical College of Wisconsin/Froedtert Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182165] [ADDRESS_693689] in their consent. 
9.0 STATISTIC AL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Sample Size  Determination  and Accrual Estimates  
This is a  pi[INVESTIGATOR_534077] a sample size  of N=35, which would result in a 10% 
margin of error and a 90% exact confidence interval for a true population proportion of TG men 
with increased risk of breast cancer (assuming that [ADDRESS_693690] 
an elevated BC risk). In the future, enrolling 125 TG individuals would allow investigators to obtain 
a 90% confidence interval with a margin of error of 5%.  
The sample size is also in line with reaching our accrual goal within a one- year period, as it 
represents one third of the patient population currently seen by [CONTACT_534093] . 
9.2 Analysis Plan  
9.2.1  Analysis Population  
Data from all participants will be used for endpoint analyses.  Data from subjects who withdraw or 
discontinue will be not used.  
9.2.2  Endpoint Analysis  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize participant characteristics and study outcomes 
for the above study aims. Median and range will be used for summarizing continuous variables; 
counts and percentages will be used for categorical variables.  
To assess and compare the self -perceived breast cancer risk with calculated risk  for third primary 
endpoint , self-perceived risk will be compared to mean BC calculated risk using the Wilcoxon 
related sample test . Chi-squared tests will be used to assess patient factors associated with under 
and overestimating self -perceived risk.  
9.3 Missing Data  
No major missing data relevant to the primary endpoints are anticipated. Unforeseen missing 
data, if any, will be addressed in consultation with the study statistician. 
10.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN (DSMP)  
10.1 Data and Safety Management Overview  
The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and the 
MCW Institutional Review Board (IRB) will approve protocol -specific DSM plans. A local, 
investigator -initiated trial will be required to be continuously monitored by [CONTACT_458] 
[INVESTIGATOR_534078].  
The DSMP for this study will involve the following entities:  
BC Risk Assessment  22 Version No. : 1.0

The study team minimally consists of 1) the principal investigator, [CONTACT_534103], 2) a nurse 
practitioner, Anna Purdy , APNP, who is a co- investigator on the study, and 3) the study 
biostatistician. While subjects are on treatment, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_534079]. This review will include but not be limited 
to reportable SAEs and UPI[INVESTIGATOR_534080]. The appropriateness of further subject enrollment 
and the specific intervention for a next subject enrollment is addressed. All meetings including 
attendance should be documented. 
10.3 Quality Assurance  
The MCWCC Clinical Trials Office (CTO) provides ongoing quality assurance audits.  
This study has been categorized as low risk by [CONTACT_534094] (MCWCC) Scientific 
Review Committee (SRC) and will be reviewed internally by [CONTACT_534095], 6.5.[ADDRESS_693691] priority on ensuring the safety of subjects participating in clinical trials. Every cancer interventional trial conducted at MCW includes a plan for safety and data monitoring. 
More information can be found related to the MCWCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan at the 
MCWCC website ( Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
). 
This study will be reviewed by [CONTACT_534096] (MCWCC DSMC). A summary of the MCWCC DSMC activities are as follows:  
• Review the clinical trial for data integrity and safety.   
• Review all DSM reports.  
• Submit a summary of any recommendations related to study conduct.  
• Terminate the study if deemed unsafe for the subject.  
A copy of the MCWCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan and membership roster will be maintained 
in the study research file and updated as membership changes. The committee will review reports 
from the study principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_182168] (or more frequently if needed) and provide recommendations on trial continuation, suspension or termination as necessary.   
Any available DSMC letters will be submitted to the IRB of record as required.

regulatory requirements.  
11.2 Regulatory Compliance 
This study will be conducted in compliance with:  
• The protocol . 
• Federal regulations, as applicable, including 21 CFR § 50 (Protection of Human 
Subjects/Informed Consent); 21 CFR § 56 (Institutional Review Boards) and §312 
(Investigational New Drug Application; and 45 CFR § 46 Subparts A (Common Rule), B 
(Pregnant Women, H uman Fetuses and Neonates), C (Prisoners), and D (Children), 
GCP/ICH guidelines, and all applicable regulatory requirements. The IRB must comply 
with the regulations in 21 CFR §56 and applicable regulatory requirements.  
11.3 Informed Consent Process 
Informed co nsent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. D iscussion of the risks and 
possible benefits of this study  will be provided to subjects and their families. Consent forms 
describing in detail the study objectives , procedures,  and risks are given to the subject and 
documentation of informed consent is required prior to enrollment . Consent forms will include the 
MCW IRB template language and must be approved by [CONTACT_534097].  
The patient  will be asked to read and review the document. Upon reviewing the document, the 
investigator s will explain the research study to the patient  and answer any questions that may 
arise. In accordance with 46 C FR §46.111, the patient  will sign and date the informed consent 
document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  A witness should only 
sign when required, per FH/MCW IRB policy. The subjects will have the opportunity to discuss 
the s tudy with their surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The subjects may 
withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial.  
If the patient signs the consent form, t he original signed document will become part of the pat ient’s 
medical records and the patient will receive a copy of the signed document.  
11.[ADDRESS_693693] Confidentiality and Access to Source Documents/Data  
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_458] , participating 
investigators, and  any staff. This confidentiality includes the clinical information relating to 
participating subjects, as well as any genetic or biological testing.  
The study protocol, documentation, data,  and all other information generated will be held in strict 
confidence. No information concerning the study or data will be released to any unauthorized third 
party without prior written approval of the principal investigator . The conditions for maintaining 
BC Risk Assessment  24 Version No. : 1.0

The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_534082], including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and pharmacy records for the subjects in this study. 
The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
11.[ADDRESS_693694] Risks  
There is the potential for participant anxiety or distress regarding the results of their personalized 
BC risk asse ssment and/or their genetic test results. Our study team will do our best to answer 
questions and assuage concerns regarding anxiety of distress of testing results, we are also supported by [CONTACT_534098] . 
Another  risk of taking part in a research study is that more people will handle the personal health 
information collected for this study. The study team will make every effort to protect the information 
and keep it confidential  (see Section 10.1
), but it is possible that an unauthorized person might 
see it. Depending on the kind of information being collected, it might be used in a way that could 
embarrass the subject or affect his/her ability to get insurance.

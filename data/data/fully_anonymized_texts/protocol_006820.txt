    SYNOPSIS 
Name [CONTACT_791]: Allogeneic Micronized Dehydrated Human  
Amnion/Chorion Membrane (Micronized dHACM), a.k.a. AmnioFix Injectable  
Study Design: A Phase 2B, Prospective, Double -Blinded, Randomized Controlled Trial of the 
Micronized dHACM Injection as Compared to Saline Placebo Injection in the Treatment of 
Osteoarthritis of the Knee  
Indication: Knee osteoarthritis (OA)  
Objective: To determine the safety and effectiveness of micronized dHACM as compared to 
the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP placebo control for the treatment of knee 
osteoarthritis  
Sample Size: Approximately 466 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Subjects to be 
randomized 1:1 in treatment arms.  
Study Plan: The estimated enrollment period is [ADDRESS_1021378] will receive 1 
injection and be evaluated for efficacy and safety during a 12 -month observation period. A 
second injection (open-l abel access to micronized dHACM) will be offered to all subjects at 
the 180-day, 270-day, and 365-day time points, see open -label access section below ; it may 
only be used once. The study is expected to be completed within 44 months, inclusive of 
enrollment and follow -up for all subjects.  
Procedures and Assessments:  
• Treatment  (approx. 1 day): Screening, pre -procedure evaluation, injection procedure, 
baseline evaluation.  
• Clinical Follow -up (365-545 days): Routine follow -up with physical examination; 
pain, function, and quality of life measurements: Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Pain, 
VAS for Satisfaction, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) will 
be evaluated at baseline, [ADDRESS_1021379] pain diaries will be completed at predefined 
intervals.  
• Safety Follow -up (365-545 days): Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs), and Unanticipated Adverse Events will be evaluated at [ADDRESS_1021380] to receive  the open -label access treatment . 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints (VAS for Pain  and Total WOMAC ):  
The co -primary efficacy endpoints are:  
• The change in VAS score for pain between baseline and Day 90 
• The change in WOMAC osteoarthritis index total score ( Total WOMAC score) 
between baseline and Day  90 
Primary Safety Endpoint: The primary safety endpoint is t he proportion of product -related 
Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and unanticipated a dverse events 
throughout the study . 
Secondary Endpoints:  
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are: 
• Change in VAS score for pain between baseline and 180 days 
• Change in Total WOMAC score between baseline and [ADDRESS_1021381] of Micronized dHACM vs. Saline Placebo 
in Treatment of Knee OA

    Exploratory Endpoint:  
For the cohort of subjects in the main phase of the study, i.e. who did not receive or have not 
yet received an open -label injection, the following exploratory endpoints will be assessed : 
• Change in VAS score for pain between baseline and i -day (with i=30, 60, 270, and 
365 days) 
• Change in Total WOMAC score between baseline and i -day (with i=30, 60, 270, 
and 365 days) 
• Change in pain, stiffness, and phys ical function WOMAC subscale scores between 
baseline and i -day (with i=30, 60, 90, 180, 270, and 365 days) 
• Change in VAS score for satisfaction between baseline and i-day (with i=30, 60, 
90, 180, 270, and 365 days) 
• Change in KOOS scores between baseline an d i-day (with i=30, 60, 90, 180, 270, 
and 365 days)  
• Patient pain diary endpoints will be collected and summarized across applicable time points  
For the cohort of subjects in the extension phase, i.e. who received the open- label injection and 
are within the  period after the open-label injection, the following endpoints will be collected 
and summarized across applicable time points: VAS score for pain, Total WOMAC, WOMAC 
subscales for pain, stiffness and physical function, VAS score for satisfaction, KOOS, and pain 
diary entries.  
Inclusion Criteria  
All subjects enrolled must meet all the following criteria:  
1. Age ≥ 21 and ≤ [ADDRESS_1021382] has a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) defined as Grade [ADDRESS_1021383] of Micronized dHACM vs. Saline Placebo 
in Treatment of Knee OA

Document: AIOA001  Effective Date: 01/31/2020  Version Number: V2  
    Exclusion Criteria  
Any potential  subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from enrollment 
and subsequent randomization. 
1. Subject has a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) defined as Grade 4 on the Kellgren 
Lawrence grading scale  
2. BMI greater than 40 kg/m2 
3. Subject has active infection at the injection site  
4. Symptomatic OA of the contralateral knee or of either hip that is not responsive to acetaminophen (Tylenol
®) and requires other therapy. 
5. Subject has rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or have been diagnosed with any 
other disorders that is the prima ry source of their knee pain, including but not limited 
to: osteonecrosis, radiculopathy, bursitis, tendinitis, tumor, cancer 
6. Subject has documented history of gout or pseudo-gout 
7. Subject has autoimmune disease or a known history of having Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndromes (AIDS) or HIV 
8. Subject has received any of the following to the target knee:  
a.  Intra -articular hyaluronic acid (HA) injection within 12 weeks prior to screening 
b. Steroid or platelet rich plasma (PRP) injection within [ADDRESS_1021384] is currently taking anticoagulant therapy (excluding Plavix or Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) 
13. Subject is pregnant or plans to become pregnant within [ADDRESS_1021385] is a worker’s compensation patient  
16. Subject is a prisoner  
Open -Label  Access : 
All study subjects will be eligible to receive one injection of micronized dHACM  at either of 
the Day 180, Day 270, and Day 365 time points. T he investigators and subjects will remain 
blind to the initial treatment assignment at this time, and until the study is unblind ed.  
Subjects who receive the open -label access treatment  will continue to be followed for 180 days 
after this second injection, regardless of the time at which treatment was received . 
Statistical Methods:  
The change in VAS score for pain and Total WOMAC score between baseline and Day 90 
(primary endpoints ) and between baseline and Day 180 (secondary endpoints ) will be 
compared between the treatment arms using an ANOVA with treatment as a fixed effect and 
study site as the block ef fect.  
For the purposes of this protocol, we will be examining knee osteoarthritis. The hypothesis to 
be tested is to confirm that the use of micronized dHACM  offers a statistically significant 
advantage over placebo control.  
Efficacy and safety data will be submitted for evaluation following the completion of the study 
follow -up.

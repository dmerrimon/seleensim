1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMM ARY AND/OR SCHEMA 
 
This t rial is ph ase I-II study of dasatinib in combin ation with w eekly paclitaxel for patients with 
advanced and m etastatic breast carcinoma. 
 
The phase I compon ent of the study will be  open to all patients with m etastatic breast carcinoma, 
regardless of ER/PR/HER2 status and numb er and type of prior regimens. 
 
The phase II compon ent will be  open to p atients with HE R2 negative metastatic breast carcinoma, 
with 0 -2 prior chemoth erapeutic regimen for metastatic disease. Patients w ith ER/PR positive disease 
will be  allowed to enter the study. 
 
 
Dasatinib  [SPRYCEL®]  is  a  potent,  broad  spectrum  ATP-competitive  inhibitor  of  5  critical 
oncogenic tyrosine kinase/kinase families: BCR-ABL, SRC, c-KIT, PDGF receptor β (PDGFRβ), and 
ephrin (EPH) receptor kinases, each of whi ch has been linked to multiple forms of hu man 
malignancies. (1) 
 
Drug discovery and non -clinical pharmacology studies show ed that dasatinib: 
 
 Kills BCR-ABL dependent leukemic cell lines, including  a numb er that are resistant to imatinib 
due to kinase domain mutations or overexpression  of SRC family kin ases and is effec tive against 
all imatinib-resistant kin ase domain mut ations t ested to d ate, except T31 5I 
 Inhibit ed proliferation of  cancer cell lines that express activated SRC or c-KIT 
 Potently inhibits VE GF-stimulated proliferation and migration in HUVE Cs 
 Has potent bone  anti-resorptive activity 
 
 
More specifically, recent data show ed that dasatinib s electively inhibits growth of  basal-type 
/ER/PR/HER2 negative breast cancer cell lines growing in vit ro. 
 
Two ph ase II trials are currently ongoing to assess activity and safety of single agent dasatinib in 
patients with m etastatic breast carcinoma  ER/PR/HER2 negative (CA 18 0059) and ER/PR positive  or 
HER2 positive  (CA 180088 ). 
 
The combin ation of  chemoth erapy and dasatinib is currently being studied in patients with 
malignancies. This stu dy will aim at defining the maximum  tolerated dose  (MTD ), for the 
combin ation of  weekly paclitaxel and dasatinib. 
 
Once established the MTD, the  phase II portion of  the study will aim at defining efficacy and safety 
of the combin ation in p atients with HE R2 negative metastatic breast carcinoma.

benefit (CR+PR+SD > 6 months ), time to tumor  progression,  progression  free survival and duration 
of respons e. Toxicity will be evaluated in terms of a toxicity rate; the type, frequency, severity, 
timing and relationship  of each toxicity will be determined as per the NCI Common  Toxicity Criteria, 
version 3. (Common  Terminolo gy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Available at 
http:// ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pd f) 
 
 
Eligible patients must h ave pathologically confirmed breast cancer, which is known to be  metastatic 
or locally advanced. Patients must h ave at least one site of measurable disease using RECIST criteria 
(Appendix E). 
 
In the  Phase I portion of  the study, a standard three patient per cohort dose  escalation s cheme will be 
used, treating between [ADDRESS_704128], three-patient per cohort dose 
escalation s chedule.  Between 6 and 54 patients will be  required to d etermine the MTD of  dasatinib. 
There will be  no int rapatient dose  escalation. The  starting dose of dasatinib is 70 mg  DAILY, given 
continuous ly (Dose level 0). Two dose  reductions levels have been included, if necessary.  It is 
expected that the maximum of  54 patients will be  enrolled in l ess than one  year, between the  two 
centers.  All p atients wi thin a  cohort will be  observed for toxicity for 4 weeks (1 cycle) prior to 
entering patients at the next dose  level. 
 
Once the MTD  for dasatinib has been identified, addition al patients will be enrolled into the Phase II 
portion of the study to determine the efficacy and safety of dasatinib at the MTD  when administ ered 
in combin ation with weekly paclitaxel.  Efficacy will be measured in terms of response  rate assessed 
after 2 cycles of therapy.  Simon’s two-stage opt imal design will be us ed to test the null  hypothesis of 
a 15% response  rate against the alternative of a 30% response  rate.  Setting both the Type I and Type 
II errors at 10%, [ADDRESS_704129] a negative result.  If 4 or more respons es are 
observed, enrollment will be extended to 55 patients.  If > [ADDRESS_704130] a positive  result and this regimen would  be consid ered 
worthy of further testing.  For this design, the probability of early termination is 54% if the true 
response  probability is < 10%.  Upon  completion of  the study, the true response rate will be estimated 
via the observed response rate and an exact confidence interval will be  constructed. 
 
 
The maximum of  55 patients possible  for the Phase II portion of  this stu dy is estimated to t ake one 
year to accrue with an anticipated enrollment of  5 patients p er month b etween the  two centers. 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AI MS 
 
The primary objectives of this t rial are: 
 
Phase I Portion: To determine the MTD  of dasatinib when administ ered in combin ation with 
a fixed dose  of weekly paclitaxel. 
Amended: 06/15/15

Phase II Portion: To estimate efficacy (objective response  rate; ORR; complete response   
 (CR) + partial response  (PR)) of dasatinib when administ ered in combin ation with weekly paclitaxel 
at the MTD established during the phase I portion of  this t rial. 
 
The secondary objectives of this t rial are: 
 
Phase I Portion: 
 
1.   To obt ain preliminary data on the  therapeutic activity of dasatinib wh en administ ered in 
combin ation with w eekly paclitaxel. 
 
Phase II Portion: 
 
1.   To obt ain safety and tol erability of dasatinib wh en administ ered in combin ation with w eekly 
paclitaxel; 
2.   To estimate secondary efficacy endpoints of  this combin ation in cluding  clinical benefit 
(CR+PR+SD > 6 months ), time  to tumor  progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS) 
and du ration of  respons e. 
3.   To obtain exploratory tumor biomarker data: assays of p-SRC, VEGFR2 and 
Collagen Type IV in plasma, obtained at baseline and after 2 cycles of treatment (8 
weeks), will be performed by [CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent assay. 
4.   To p erform analysis of  mRNA expression on the  tumor  specimens, for a gene expression  
profiling of the respond ers versus non -respond ers, in order to identify potential predictors of 
response  to dasatinib. If differe ntially interesting candidates emerge, immunohisto chemistry 
assays including  EphA2, IGFBP2, caveolin and phospho -caveolin and ot her potential 
predictive markers and SFK subst rates as available will also be  performed.

breast cancer is generally not curable with currently available therapy. (3) To date, the five-year 
survival rate for wom en with distant metastases is only 21 %, underscoring the need for more 
efficacious therapeutic options  for the advanced stages of this disease.  When metastatic disease is 
diagnosed, the goals of treatment are multipl e, including cure (<5%), palliation of symptoms  and 
improved survival. Hormonal therapy is usually the first-line treatment of choice for those  women 
with hormone  receptor-positive  cancer but eventually nearly all patients develop hormone  refractory

disease.  For  these  women,  and  for  those  with  hormone  receptor-negative  disease,  cytotoxic  
 chemoth erapy is utili zed. 
Today there are several classes of cytotoxic treatment available to patients with m etastatic disease 
(eg, anthracyclines, taxanes, fluoropyrimidin es, vin ca alkaloids, topoisom erase inhibito rs). A 
treatment paradigm of sequential single agent therapy is practiced in this dis ease of chronicity. 
 
Newly introduced hormonal, cytotoxic and biolo gically targeted agents are hoped to imp rove upon 
the modest survival advantage with systemic therapy for these women. 
 
3.2 Dasa tinib 
 
 
Dasatinib [SPRYCEL®] is a potent, broad spectrum AT P-competitive inhibitor of 5 critical oncogenic 
tyrosine kin ase/kinase families: BCR-ABL, SRC, c-KIT, PDGF receptor β (PDGFRβ), and ephrin 
(EPH) receptor kinases, each of which has been link ed to multiple  forms of  human malignancies. (1) 
 
Drug discovery and nonclinical pharmacology  studies showed that dasatinib: (4) 
 
 Kills BCR-ABL dependent leukemic cell lines, including  a numb er that are resistant to imatinib 
due to kinase domain mutations or overexpression  of SRC family kin ases and is effec tive against 
all imatinib-resistant kin ase domain mut ations t ested to d ate, except T31 5I 
     Inhibit ed proliferation of  cancer cell lines that express activated SRC or c-KIT 
     Potently inhibits VE GF-stimulated proliferation and migration in HUVE Cs 
     Has potent bone  anti-resorptive activity 
 
3.2.1  Pre-clinical Anti-tumor Activity: In Vitro Molecular Studies 
 
Dasatinib potently inhibits:  SRC kinases, BCR-ABL, c-KIT, PDGFRβ and EPHA and was less potent 
against 16 other unrelated protein tyrosine kin ases (PTKs) and serine/threonine kin ases. Imatinib is 
less potent against several key enzymes: for example, Dasatinib was 260-, 8-, 60-, and >1000-fold 
more potent than imatinib v ersus BCR-ABL, c-KIT, PDGFR, and SRC kinases, respectively.2 
 
In  vitro,  dasatinib  was  active  in  leukemic  cell  lines  representing  variants  of  imatinib  mesylate 
sensitive  and resistant disease. dasatinib inhibit ed the growth of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 
and acute lymphobl astic leukemia (ALL) cell lines overexpressing  BCR-ABL. Under the conditions 
of the assays, dasatinib was able to overcome imatinib resistance resulting  from BCR-ABL kinase 
domain  mut ations,  activation  of  alternate signaling pathways  involving  the  SRC  family kinases 
(LYN, H CK), and multi -drug resistance gene overexpression. (1) 
 
Dasatinib inhibits the  BCR-ABL kinase with an in vitro IC50 of 3 nM, a  potency 260-fold greater than 
that of im atinib mesylate (IC50 = 790  nM). In cellular assays, dasatinib killed or inhibit ed the 
proliferation  of  all  BCR-ABL  dependent  leukemic  cell  lines  tested  to  date.  Dasatinib  also 
demonst rated undiminish ed anti-tumor  activity against several preclinically- and clinically-derived 
models of imatinib mesylate resistance. Evidence that SRC family kinase over expression  may play a 
role in clinical resistance to imatinib mesylate was demonst rated in three CML cell lines established 
Amended: 06/15/15 
- 10 - 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ca ncer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 08-122 A()  
  
from patients who failed imatinib mesylate therapy. These cells remained highly sensitive  to the 
cell-killing  effects of dasatinib. 
 
These results demonst rate that dasatinib is effective in reducing the  proliferation or survival of both 
imatinib mesylate-sensitive  and resistant cells, and its inhibitory activity is not solely dependent on 
BCR-ABL. 
 
In cells, dasatinib inhibit ed c-SRC, and oth er kinases in the  SRC kinase family (including  LCK, YES, 
FYN) at sub-nanomol ar concentrations. D asatinib inhibit ed the cellular SRC 
autophospho rylation in s everal cancer cell lines that highly express c-SRC, including  the 
human prostate carcinoma cells PC3 and MDA -PCa-2b, and the  human colon carcinoma 
cells WiDr and SW-480. 
 
The concentrations required to inhibit SRC autophospho rylation in these cells (15 - 135 nM) 
approximate those needed for inhibition of cellular proliferation (range = 17 - 845 nM, 
median = 35 nM, n = 10). 
 
Dasatinib demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity for VEGF- or bFGF-dependent 
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). An IC50 of [ADDRESS_704132] 
VEGF-stimulated growth and of 248 nM under bFGF-driven growth conditions was 
demonstrated. Dasatinib also inhibited HUVEC cell migration with IC50 of < [ADDRESS_704133] in vitro cell migration assay (Boyden chamber). 
 
SRC ki nase plays a major role in osteoclast function. In short-term in vitro studies, dasatinib 
was a potent inhibitor of bone resorption. Dasatinib also potently inhibits KIT, the receptor 
tyrosine kinase for the natural cognate ligand stem-cell factor (SCF), also known as Steel 
factor (SLF); constitutive activation of KIT is a critical oncogenic contributing factor to the 
malignant phenotype of the sarcoma known as Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST). 
In an in vitro biochemical assay, dasatinib inhibited KIT with an IC50 of 22 nM, while the IC50 
for imatinib mesylate was 169 nM, an 8-fold difference. 
 
In three small cell lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H59, H526 and H187) that are dependent on 
SCF for proliferation, dasatinib inhibited SCF-driven proliferation with IC50 in the range of 
114 - 220 nM. In the same study, the IC50 for imatinib mesylate was 1150 - 2270 nM, a 
difference in potency of about 10-fold. The concentration range of dasatinib required to 
inhibit KIT phosphorylation in cells (10 - 1000 nM) was in agreement with that needed for 
inhibiting cellular proliferation. 
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_704134] ration of dasatinib principally affected the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, 
including the  liver, the hematopoietic and lymphoid systems in rats and monk eys. Other prominent 
effects after single oral administ ration of dasatinib included renal and cardiac toxicity in rats at lethal

doses, and cutaneous h emorrhage in monk eys.  Dasatinib can also affect the immune  system and bone 
turnover. 
 
 
 
Dasatinib in vitro activity in the HERG/IKr and Purkinje-fiber assays indicated a moderate liability 
for prolong ation of cardiac ventricular repolarization (QT interval) in the clinic. How ever, there were 
no d asatinib -related changes obs erved in electrocardiograms, n ervous system function, respi[INVESTIGATOR_540207], blood  pressure, or arterial oxygen saturation in single-dose, 10-day, or 1-month  oral 
toxicity studies in monk eys. 
 
Dasatinib was found to exhibit a profile of broad-spectrum platelet inhibition  best typi[INVESTIGATOR_97085]- 
platelet agents su ch as the GPI[INVESTIGATOR_97086]/IIIa antagonists, int egrelin and abciximab. 
 
Finally, modul ation of SRC kinase activity could also affect osteoclast morpholo gy and function and 
bone remodeling. This effect could potentially result in an increase in bone mineral density and a 
phenotype analogous to  osteopetrosis.(4) 
 
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_704135] Cancer 
 
An artificial Src-driven cell line “mamSRC” was developed which is sensitive to 
dasatinib in vitro with IC50 = 3.2 nM; sensitivity in vivo was striking: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of [ADDRESS_704136] cancer cell lines, 11 were sensitive in vitro to dasatinib (defined as IC50 
< 1µM); as will be indicated in Section 3.5.1, these were predominantly those of basal-like 
subtype. Well-tolerated regimens of oral dasatinib, typi[INVESTIGATOR_540208] a 5-day

per week schedule to immunodeficient mice bearing xenograft tumors, provided growth 
inhibition of 32 - 87%, depending on the cell line. Additional studies are in progress. 
 
 
 
3.2.4  Results of Clinical Investigations 
 
Dasatinib was initially developed in patients with imatinib-resistant or –intolerant CML. A 
Phase I trial CA180002 was completed (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and identified 70 mg twice 
daily (BID) as a safe starting dose for CML patients. (5) Subsequent Phase II trials were 
performed in all phases of imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant CML to assess the 
efficacy and safety of dasatinib. (9-13) Data were submitted for regulatory 
review, leading to approval of dasatinib in the U.S. Two randomized phase III studies 
(CA180 0034 and CA1800035) were performed to compare efficacy and safety of daily vs 
BID sc hedules in all phases of CML and of total daily dose in chronic phase CML . 
Two Phase I trials are in progress in  patients with recurrent or progressive solid tumors, one 
(CA180 003) using a BID and one (CA180021) using a daily schedule. 
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_704137] been evaluated in 229 healthy subjects and in 137 patients 
with l eukemia (CML or Ph+ALL) from a Phase I clinical study (CA1800 02). (4) 
 
Maximum  plasma concentrations (Cmax) of dasatinib are observed between 0.5 and 6 hou rs (Tmax) 
following o ral administ ration. dasatinib exhibits dose  proportional increases in AUC  and linear 
elimination characteristics over the dose range of 15 mg to  240 mg/day. The overall mean terminal 
half-life of dasatinib is 3 –5 hou rs. (1) 
 
Data from a study of [ADDRESS_704138] ered a single, 100-mg dose of dasatinib 30 minut es 
following consumption  of a high-fat meal resulted in a 14% increase in the mean AUC  of dasatinib. 
The observed food effects were not clinically relevant. 
 
In patients, dasatinib has an apparent volume  of distribution  of [ADDRESS_704139] ributed in the extravascular space. Binding of dasatinib and its active metabolite  to 
human plasma proteins in vitro was approximately 96% and 93%, respectively, with no concentration 
dependence over the range of 100–500 ng/mL. (1) 
 
Dasatinib is extensively metabolized in humans, primarily by [CONTACT_35233] P450 enzyme 3A4. 
CYP3A4 was the primary enzyme responsible  for the formation of the active metabolite. Flavin- 
cotaining monoo xygenase 3 (FMO-3) and uridine diphosph ate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 
enzymes are also involv ed in the formation of dasatinib metabolites. In human liver microsom es, 
dasatinib w as a weak tim e-dependent inhibitor  of CYP3A4.  
 
The exposure of the active metabolite, which is equipot ent to dasatinib, represents approximately 5% 
of the dasatinib AUC. This indicates that the active metabolite  of dasatinib is unlikely to play a major 
role in the observed pharmacology of the drug. Dasatinib also had several other inactive oxidative 
metabolites.

Dasatinib is a time-dependent inhibitor  of CYP3A3.  At clinically relevant concentrations,  dasatinib 
does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6,  or 2E1. Dasatinib is not an inducer of human 
CYP enzymes. (1) 
Elimin ation is primarily via  the feces. Follow ing a single oral dose of [14C]-labeled dasatinib, 
approximately 4%  and 85% of the administ ered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, 
respectively, within  10 days. Unchanged dasatinib accounted for 0.1% and 19% of the adminis tered 
dose in urine and feces, respectively, with the remainder of the dose being metabolites. (1) 
 
 
3.2.6  Pharmacodynamics of Dasa tinib 
 
Src phosphorylation was studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and 
xenograft tumors (prostate cancer cell line PC3) of mice. Phospho-Src inhibition was 
> 90% both in PBMC and in tumor at doses ≥ 15 mg/kg, and correlated closely with 
tumor growth inhibition. 
 
Doses of ~200 mg provide plasma concentrations in human subjects comparable to 
15 mg/kg in mouse (Cmax ~150 - 200 ng/mL). The in vitro dose-response curve for 
phospho-Src inhibition is the same in PBMC of human and mouse. In human PBMC, 
60 - 80% inhibition of phospho-Src persisted for at least 6 - 8 hours after doses of 
≥ 70 mg; inhibition of tumor SFKs has not been measured in humans. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Somatic Mutations and Response to Dasa tinib-Paclitaxel Drug 
Combination 
 
In lung cancers models and patients, activating somatic mutations of the Discoidin Dom ain Receptor 
2 (DDR2) gene were shown to be both oncogenic and associated with high sensitivi ty to dasatinib as 
single agent (Hammerman et al, Cancer Discov 2011). DDR2 is receptor tyrosine kin ase that binds 
collagen as its endogenous ligand and is mutated in about 3% of squamous  cell lung carcinomas. A 
paralog gene, DDR1, also exists. DDR2 mutations have been shown  to be present in breast cancer at 
a frequency of 1 to 2%, according to data from T he Cancer Genome  Atlas (TCGA). 
 
Somatic  genomic  analyses,  based  on  next-generation  sequencing  (NGS)  techniqu es  applied  to 
archival breast cancer tissue s amples and/or on  plasma (circulating tumor DN A) can unravel the 
somatic mutation(s) associated with sensitivi ty to the tested treatment regimen. This approach can be 
used not only to investigate the existence of both known  (e.g. DDR2) mutations,  but also for the 
identification of  novel mut ations related to s ensitivi ty or resistance to a given therapy. 
 
3.2.7  Experience in CML 
 
Dasatinib has been administered to more than 2000 subjects, the majority with CML 
refractory or intolerant to imatinib. Dasatinib’s activity has been investigated in eight 
Phase 1 studies (CA180009, CA180016, CA180019, CA180020, CA180022, CA180032, 
CA180037, and CA180002) and five Phase 2 studies (CA180005, CA180006,

CA180013, CA180015, and CA180017) that supported the approved indication and 
dosage of dasatinib at 70 mg BID in subjects with CML or Ph+ ALL.(4) Two Phase 3 
studies (CA1800034 and CA180035) were designed to compare alternate doses and 
administration schedules in imatinib resistant or intolerant subjects with chronic, 
accelerated, or blast phase CML or Ph+ ALL. 
 
 
Four single-arm multicenter studies were conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of dasatinib 
in patients with CML or Philadelphia chromosom e-positive  acute lympho blastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) 
resistant to or intolerant of treatment with imatinib. All patients were treated with dasatinib 70 mg 
BID on a continuous b asis. The  median durations of treatment was between 2.8 - 5.6 months.  
 
The primary efficacy endpoint  in chronic phase CML w as major cytogenetic response  (MCyR), 
defined as elimination (complete cytogenetic response, CCyR) or subst antial diminution  (by [CONTACT_2669] 
65%, partial cytogenetic respons e) of Ph+ hematopoietic cells. The primary endpoint  in accelerated 
phase, myeloid blast phase, and lymphoid  blast phase CML, and Ph+ ALL was major hematologic 
response (MaHR), defined as either a complete hematologic response or no evidence of leukemia as 
defined in the  table below.

[IP_ADDRESS] Safety of Dasa tinib in Clinical Studies in CML and Ph+ ALL 
 
The d ata presented in Table [ADDRESS_704140] exposure to dasatinib in 2182 patients with leukemia in  clinical 
studies (starting dosage 100 mg o nce daily, 140 mg on ce daily, 50 mg twice daily, or 70 mg twice 
daily). The median duration of  therapy was 11 m onths (range 0.03–26 mo nths). 
 
The majority of dasatinib-treated patients experienced adverse reactions at some  time. Drug was 
discontinu ed for adverse reactions in 9% of p atients in chronic ph ase CML, 10% in  accelerated phase 
CML, 15% in myeloid blast phase CML, and 8% in lymphoid  blast phase CML or Ph+ ALL. In a 
Phase 3 dose-optimi zation study in patients with chronic phase CML, the rate of discontinu ation for 
adverse reaction was lower in patients treated with 100 mg once daily than in patients treated with 70 
mg twice daily (4% and 12%, respectively). 
 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (reported in ≥20%  of patients) included fluid retention 
events, di arrhea, headache, skin rash, nausea, hemorrhage, fatigue, and dyspnea. 
 
The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions included pleural effusion  (9%), pyrexia (3%), 
pneumonia  (3%), infection (2%), febrile neutropenia (4%), gastrointestinal bleeding (4%), dyspnea 
(3%), sepsis (1%), diarrhea (2%), congestive heart failure (2%), and pericardial effusion (1%).

Myelosupp ression  was common ly reported in all patient popul ations.  The frequency of Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia, thrombo cytopenia, and anemia was higher in patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ 
ALL than in chronic phase CML (Table 4). Myelosupp ression  was reported in patients with normal 
baseline laboratory values as well as in p atients w ith pre-existing  laboratory abnormalities. 
 
In patients who experienced severe myelosupp ression,  recovery generally occurred following  dose

3.2.8 Phase I-II experience in Solid Tumors 
 
In  a  Phase  I  study  (CA180003)  conducted  by  [CONTACT_134678]  (BMS),  dasatinib  was 
administ ered on a BID schedule to 42 subjects with refractory solid  tumo r. As of 10-Feb-2006, 33 
subjects were treated for a full 4 weeks for evaluation of dose-limiting to xicities (DLTs). This study 
explored [ADDRESS_704149] schedule assessed 5 days of 
dasatinib follow ed by 2 days off-drug each week, and the second schedule assessed continuous  daily 
dosing  that was added in Amendment #3 (7-Mar-2005). In the 5 days on/2 days off schedule, the 
following do se levels were explored: [ADDRESS_704150]. Given the 
otherwise acceptable tolerability of this dose level with toxicities that are medically manageable with 
a maximum  severity of Grade 2, further escalation to the next dose level of 120 mg BID continuous 
daily schedule is currently under investigation. No  further escalation above 160 mg BID was explored 
on this s chedule because, as per protocol, this represents the  maximum tol erated dose  (MTD). (4) 
 
The preliminary safety results from CA180003  demonst rate that no severe clinical toxicity has been 
encountered. Dasatinib did not induce significant myelosupp ression  in this patient popul ation

reported in 17 subjects (40%) and rash in 9 subjects (21%). Edema, lethargy and headache were 
uncommon,  and appear to be dose-related. Addit ionally, the incidence and severity of fluid retention 
and of pleural effusion,  in particular, appear to be less in subjects with solid tumo rs than in those w ith 
leukemia receiving comparable doses of dasatinib. There were 4 subjects with drug-related AEs 
leading to  discontinu ation; none of these events were related to myelosuppression  or fluid retention. 
(4) 
 
In another Phase I study (CA180021 ), dasatinib was administ ered on a daily schedule to 24 subjects 
with solid tumo rs in a drug-drug interaction and multi-ascending  dose (MAD)  study at doses up to 
[ADDRESS_704151] of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor  of CYP3A4, on 
the PK of dasatinib (Segment 1) and the effect of dasatinib on pharmacodynamic markers in subjects 
with advanced solid tumo rs that are refractory to standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_540210] (Segment 2). 
 
Segment 1 includes 18 subjects, of whi ch 16 subjects were treated with dasatinib as of 2-Jan-2006. 
Segment 2 includes approximately 30  addition al subjects, of which 14 subjects were treated with 
dasatinib as of 2-Jan-2006. A total of 4 deaths, all related to dis ease progression, w ere reported. Th ere 
were 4 subjects with drug-related AEs leading to discontinu ation: [ADDRESS_704152] been mild and in frequent. (4) 
 
To date, the safety profile in solid tumor  subjects has been similar to that in CP CML subjects with 
the exception of severe myelosupp ression,  which has not been observed in solid tumor  subjects and is 
consid ered related to efficacy against the leukemia as noted above, and severe bleeding which is 
secondary to thrombo cytopenia in most inst ances. (4) 
 
Two ph ase II trials are currently ongoing to assess activity and safety of single agent dasatinib in 
patients with m etastatic breast carcinoma  ER/PR/HER2 negative (CA 18 0059) and ER/PR positive  or 
HER2 positive  (CA 180088 ). Starting dose of dasatinib is 100 mg  BID with  continuous dosin g, 
which was consid ered to be safe, based on data from the  phase I experience. 
In the  ongoing  Phase II trials how ever, suboptim al tolerance was obs erved at the dose of 100 mg 
BID, in t erms of  gastro-intestinal toxi city including  nausea and vomit, and fluid retention, in cluding 
pleural and pericardial effusions, p rompting  reduction to 70 mg  BID with continuous dosing  as 
starting dose. (Bristol M yers Squibb, d ata on file). 
 
3.3 Paclitaxel 
 
Paclitaxel is a  taxane originally derived from the bark of the of the Pacific yew tree 
(Taxus br evifolia)  and is one of the most active agents against breast cancer. Paclitaxel 
binds to the dimeric tubulin preventing microtubule disassembly by [CONTACT_540239][INVESTIGATOR_540211]. This microtubule disruption halts 
mitosis, interferes with other critical interphase functions and subsequently leads to cell 
death. (6)

Taxanes (docetaxel and paclitaxel) like  many chemotherapy drugs are known to have 
anti-angiogenic activity. Paclitaxel has been shown to inhibit endothelial cell 
proliferation, migration and tubule formation at concentrations lower than required to 
induce tumor cell kill. (7) In vivo testing demonstrated that murine microvasculature 
was significantly decreased by [CONTACT_540240]. 
 
Taxanes are indicated in several cancers but the most impressive activity of the taxanes ha s 
been seen in patients with ovarian and breast cancers. In metastatic breast cancer, 
paclitaxel is often indicated after failure of anthracycline based combination chemotherapy. 
The weekly schedu le of paclitaxel has been proven to offer the best efficacy/tolerability ratio, 
when compared to the q 3-weekly schedu le in randomized trials. (8) . 
 
As monotherapy, paclitaxel showed to induce response rates ranging from 20 - 50 % in 
earlier studies in breast cancer patients. (8,9) However, more recent randomized trials have 
reported more modest response rates, in the range of 14-16%, likely due to the fact that 
nowadays patients are receiving overall more chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting, and the 
overall likelihood of response to therapy in the metastatic setting might result diminished. 
(10, 11) 
 
Neutropenia and neuropathy are the two most common significant toxicities of paclitaxel. 
The onset of neutropenia usually occurs on days 8 to 10, with recovery generally 
complete by [CONTACT_46062] 15 to 21 in every 3 week dosing regimens at doses of 175 to 200 mg/m2 
over 3 or 24 hours intravenou s infusion. More frequent administration schedules, 
particularly weekly treatment with doses of 80 to 100 mg/m2, are associated with less 
severe neutropenia and equivalent antitumor activity in a number of cancers, when 
compared to the every 3 week schedule. In the CALGB 9840 study (weekly paclitaxel 
given as 1-hour infusion v standard 3-hour infusion of paclitaxel every third week in the 
treatment of metastatic breast cancer, with trastuzumab for HER2 positive patients) the 
administration of paclitaxel in the weekly schedu le caused less grade 3 neutropenia 
compared to the every 3 week administration regimen (8% v 15%, p = 0.013), but more 
grade 3 sensory/motor neuropathy (23/8% v 12/4%, p = 0.001/0.04). (8) 
 
3.4 Study Ra tionale: Dasa tinib in Combination with Paclitaxel 
 
 
Taxanes, including  paclitaxel, are very active agents in the  treatment of breast cancer, and have 
shown clinical benefit both in the  metastatic and adjuvant setting. (8, 12)  The combin ation of  taxanes 
with biolo gic agents is p articularly appealing in the treatment of breast cancer and has shown 
significant results in  a numb er of clinical trials. (13, 14)  
 
Dasatinib h as shown to inhibit p roliferation of  numerous solid tumor  cell lines that expressed 
activated SRC or c-KIT, including  breast, prostate, lung, colon carcinoma  and rhabdomyosarcoma 
cell lines. In hum an prostate carcinoma  xenografts, the combin ation of  dasatinib and paclitaxel 
produced antitumor  effects against th at were significantly better than the  effects of either single agent 
alone (P = 0.05). (15)

More specifically, recent data show ed that dasatinib s electively inhibits growth of  basal-type 
/ER/PR/HER2 negative breast cancer cell lines growing in vit ro. (16) Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) 
has developed promising ph armacogenomic  markers of response  to dasatinib in p reclinical mod els of 
cancer. Using in vitro assays, [ADDRESS_704153] cancer cell lines were shown to be 
relatively sensitive  to dasatinib (IC50 ≤ 1 µM). It was noted that these were predomin antly those 
known to be  of ‘basal-like’ subtype. Pharmacogenomic analysis demonst rated a 161-gene subset that 
correlated with  growth i nhibition by [CONTACT_540241]. Several genes in this subs et were shown to be 
modul ated in vitro by [CONTACT_540242]. The  existence of this expression -defined gene subset was 
demonst rated in a  large number of patient samples and found to consist l argely of ‘triple-negative’ 
cancers. Similar results, i. e. identification of  the triple-negative subtype as that likely inhibit ed by 
[CONTACT_540241], w ere obtained independently and usi ng som ewhat different methodolo gies by [CONTACT_540243]. (16)

Targeted agents have shown b est results wh en combined with chemoth erapy (13, 1 4), and th erefore 
the combin ation of  dasatinib and paclitaxel is appealing.

based on d ata from the  phase I experience. However, suboptim al tolerance was obs erved at this dos e- 
level, in t erms of  gastro-intestinal toxi city including  nausea and vomit, and fluid retention, in cluding 
pleural and pericardial effusions, p rompting  reduction to 70 mg  BID with continuous dosing  as 
starting dose. (Bristol M yers Squibb, d ata on file). 
 
In large randomi zed studies in CML,  daily dosing w as better tolerated in l ong-term us e. In chronic- 
phase CML, the efficacy of daily and BID schedules is equivalent. Th eoretically, higher peak levels 
attained on  d aily could yield some  benefit, but this rationale may be disease-specific. In the  ongoing 
SWOG t rial for bone-predomin ant dis ease, 100  daily vs 70  BID dosi ng arms are being studied. 
 
The initial compon ent of  the Phase I trial with d asatinib on BID schedule in patients with solid tumo rs 
was performed with int ermittent dosin g, 5 d ays on and 2 d ays off. DLTs were observed at dasatinib 
dose of 90 and 120 mg BID given continuous ly, and (in subs equent expansion ph ase, data not  yet 
available for distribution)  at 100 BID, but  not until 160 BID on 5 days out of  7 schedule. Althou gh 5 
days out of  7 seems to be  better tolerated, it is not completely clear (due to limit ed patient numb ers) 
whether this is really due to the  'rest break' or to a lower total dose  (4). 
 
Given the  possibili ty of a combin ed treatment toxicity of dasatinib with p aclitaxel, the  data from the 
Phase I and II trials, and the fact that other trials of tyrosine  kinase inhibito rs in combin ation with 
chemoth erapy have found better tolerance when dosing  is omitt ed at the time of the chemoth erapy 
pulse, we will plan to st art the trial at a continuo us dosing  schedule of dasatinib, but th en swit ch to 
the alternate  schedule of 5 days per week if the MTD is exceeded at that particular dose-level. If 
tolerated, then dos e-escalation will resume  on the  intermittent schedule. (see Section 4.3)  
 
3.5 Correlative Studies: 
 
3.5.1  Pharmacogenomic Identification 
Validation of putative predictive markers remains a major challenge in oncology. Bristol- 
Myers Squibb (BMS) has developed promising pharmacogenomic markers of response to 
dasatinib in preclinical models of cancer. Using in vitro assays, [ADDRESS_704156] cancer cell lines were shown to be relatively sensitive to dasatinib (IC50 ≤ 1µM). It 
was noted that these were predominantly those known to be of ‘basal-like’ subtype. 
Pharmacogenomic analysis demonstrated a 161-gene subset that correlated with growth 
inhibition by [CONTACT_540241]. Several genes in this subset, including EphA2 (see Section 3.5.4) 
were shown to be modulated in vitro by [CONTACT_540242]. The existence of this 
expression-defined gene subset was demonstrated in a large number of patient samples 
and found to consist largely of ‘triple-negative’ cancers. 
Similar results, i.e. identification of the triple-negative subtype as that likely inhibited by

dasatinib, were obtained independently and using somewhat different methodologies by 
[CONTACT_540249]. (16) 
Furthermore, a 6-gene subset was identified which correlated with in vitro response, and 
was then validated as a predictor in a separate set of [ADDRESS_704157] cancer cell lines, (thus 11 of 
35 cell lines were sensitive in toto ). The receiver operating characteristics of this predictor 
set were sensitivity 75%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%,negative 
predictive value 89%. Similarly-small (and partly-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) gene subsets were also 
identified independently by [CONTACT_540250]. The ‘triple-negative’ subset 
with basal-like phenotype (cytokeratin-positive) was again identified by [CONTACT_540251]. 
 
3.5.[ADDRESS_704158] Cancer 
 
Dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of Src-family kinases, EphA2 and other tyrosine kinases 
strongly implicated in expression of the malignant phenotype. The IC50 of dasatinib for Src- 
family kinases is in  the range of 1 nM and that for EphA2 is approximately 17 nM, depending 
on experimental conditions. 
 
3.5.3  Src-family Kinases 
Src-family kinases (SFKs) are a group of closely-related non-receptor tyrosine kinases 
which participate in numerous cellular signaling pathways. SRC is a non-receptor tyrosine 
kinase that plays a critical role in cellular proliferation, and SRC family kinases have been impli cated 
in driving the development and progression of  human malignancies. The role of Src-family kinases 
in tumor progression and expression of the metastatic phenotype has been extensively 
reviewed.(17, 18 ) Evidence has been developed for multiple specific activities of Src-
family kinases, including mediation of growth factor signals, cell-cell and cell-substrate 
adhesion, functional membrane activation and motility, invasion and migration, and 
angiogenesis. As this literature is extensive, only a few representative lines of 
evidence bearing specifically on breast cancer will be summarized here. 
 
It is well established that signaling via ErbB receptors (i.e., EGFR and Her2/neu) 
involves activation of c-Src.(19, 20)  SFK activity was shown to synergize with 
anchorage-independent heregulin-mediated growth and mediate MAPK pathway 
activation. (21) A variety of mechanisms have been suggested, including pSrc stabilization 
as well as activation by [CONTACT_540252]2/neu (ErbB2), formation of a complex with STAT5b, or 
“reverse” activation of Her2/neu kinase by [CONTACT_540253]-12 chemokine via SFK activity. 
(22, 23) Growth and survival signaling can also occur through direct Src activation by 
[CONTACT_540254] (ER) or Progesterone Receptor (PgR). (24, 25) Other mitogenic 
pathways require 
activation of Src-family kinases; for example, STAT3 signaling appears to be a major 
downstream effector of Src kinase activation in breast cancers.(26) 
 
Altered structural and cell surface properties are key characteristics of the metastatic 
phenotype, and include membrane ruffling and podosome formation, loss of anoikis,

changes in cell-cell and cell-basement membrane adhesiveness, motility and 
invasiveness - all of which are “typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]” Src-related phenomena. Although less well studied 
than mitogenic pathways, the focal adhesion proteins are essential membrane 
elements implicated in tumorigenesis. (27) 
The cadherin/catenin system mediates cell-cell adhe sion, loss of which is characteristic of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_540212]. Inhibition of Src kinase activity restores E-cadherin/catenin 
expression and cell-cell adhesion in breast cancer cells, reducing metastasis.(28) In a series 
of experiments, Src activity was shown to stimulate phosphorylation of focal adhesion 
kinase (FAK) and paxillin, suppressing adhesion-dependent apoptosis and increasing 
expression of α2-integrin. (29) A variety of mechanisms have been advocated, including 
H2O2 
stimulation of Src, increased cap-dependent translation, or direct activation of STAT5 
by [CONTACT_540255]-dependent pathways. (30) 
 
Caveolins, primary structural components of caveolae (active vesicular invaginations of 
the cell membrane), are Src kinase substrates. Moreover, Caveolin-1 and -2 are two of the 
six-gene set expression of which correlates with in vitro response to dasatinib 
(Section 26.5.1). In general, caveolin acts as a tumor suppressor, but the relationship 
between caveolin activation and malignancy is complex. On one hand, mutation or 
inactivation of caveolin-[ADDRESS_704159] interaction with 
caveolin-1,even in the absence of ligand. (31) Most recently, direct stimulation of 
proliferation by [CONTACT_540256]-1.(32) Consistent with its 
tumor-suppressor role, inactivating mutations of Cav-1 gene are found in approximately 
35% of ER-positive breast cancer samples (more than half of which are the 
dominant-negative P132L mutation), but in none of the ER-negative samples.(33) On the 
other hand, an inverse relationship has been reported between caveolin-1 expression and 
ErbB-mediated signaling. (34) 
 
Finally, Src-family kinases are known to mediate VEGF-induced angiogenesis and 
vascular permeability.(35) Both VEGF production and downstream VEGF 
action appear to require Src kinase. (36, 37) Normal endothelial cell Src-family kinase 
activity (specifically Src or Yes, but not Fyn) appears to be responsible for 
VEGF-stimulated disruption of the cadherin-catenin complex leading to tumor cell invasion 
and metastasis. (38) 
 
Pharmacodynamic data with the  biomarker phospho-SRC (pSRC) was recently presented, to evaluate 
the relationship b etween dasatinib exposure and inhibition of  SRC kinase activity. (39) The level of 
pSRC in peripheral blood mononu clear cells was used in two t rials (CA 180002 and CA 180003)  as a 
surrogate biomarker of the level of kinase activity of the SRC family members. On the  BID regimen, 
pSRC inhibition w as approximately dose-dependent across the  dosing range. SRC family kinase 
activity was subst antially inhibit ed at the exposures of dasatinib achieved.

3.5.[ADDRESS_704160] characterized for 
their role in embryogenesis, cell migration and cytoskeletal organization, and more recently 
shown to be involved in malignancy.(40) Overexpression of EphA2 has been demonstrated 
in breast cancer specimens by [CONTACT_540257].(41) Direct inhibition of 
EphA2 using monoclonal antibody provided selective reversal of malignant behavior of 
breast carcinoma cells in vitro. (42, 43)  
 
3.5.5  Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) 
 
Micrometastasis w as originally a theoretical concept: CTC were presumed to exist because cancers 
spread hematogenously, but by [CONTACT_540258] d etectable by [CONTACT_540259]. 
New and emerging technologies now m ake it possible  to sensitiv ely detect CTC in peripheral blood 
and bone  marrow of  patients with cancer. Yet, the biological and clinical meanings of CTC have not 
been fully determined. 
 
In principle, CTC technologies can be applied to many aspects of cancer management, in cluding 
detection, st aging/prognosis, assessment of treatment respons e, surveillance during remission, 
validation of  novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and isol ation of  tumor  cells for molecular analysis. For example, CTC 
detection m ay be of particular value in the  initial management of breast cancer by [CONTACT_540260], thus allowing mo re judicious use  of chemoth erapy. Indeed, 
multiple  studies have now shown th at detection of CTC in marrow by [CONTACT_540261] (ICC) is 
strongly prognostic  of recurrence and death. (44-46) 
 
A numb er of studies have suggested that the presence of CTCs in p atients with m etastatic disease is 
associated with poo rer survival and dis ease burden.  (47, 48)  Recent studi es have quantified CTCs in 
late stage breast cancer to evaluate prognosis and monitor  response  to therapy. (49) These studies 
have found h igh sensitivi ty in detecting CTC using  immunom agnetic bead enrichment of  peripheral 
blood s amples.  The  threshold for detection is o ften only a few cells/ml of  peripheral blood, how ever 
many metastatic patients have > 100 CTC/ml. (50)  Using  a newly developed technolo gy for 
autom ated ICC (CellSearch System), the presence of at least [ADDRESS_704161] rated 
in the  treatment of HER2 positive  cancers with t rastuzumab. (51) Evaluating potential targets is 
particularly difficult in m etastatic disease, where novel therapeutics undergo initi al testing and 
generally meet with su ccess or failure - due in part to the  difficulty in obt aining initial and serial 
tissue  for study.  CTCs provide  a readily accessible source of tumor  cells for comparison of  markers 
pre- and post -therapy.

 Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity that persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_540214] 4 d ays in cycle #1.

new cohort of three patients will be  treated at the next higher dose level. 
 
  If one of the three patients in a cohort experiences DLT, then up to three addition al patients 
will be treated at the same dose level.  Escalation will continue  if only one of the six patients 
experiences DLT. 
 
 If two or more patients in a cohort experience DLT, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
will have been exceeded, and no further dose escalation will occur.  The previous  dose l evel

 If the MTD  is exceeded at any given dose level < 120 mg  daily, on the continuous  schedule, 
then  that  dose  will  be assessed  on  5  days  per  week  schedule,  corresponding  to  a  28%

schedule. (if > 120 mg  daily continuous  is tolerated, there will be no need to investigate the 
intermittent dose-schedule). 
 
Therefore: 
 
o If two or more patients in cohort 0 (paclitaxel 80 mg/m2  and dasatinib 70 mg  daily 
continuous ly), experience DLT, then patients will be enrolled at dose l evel -1, with 
paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly and dasatinib 70 mg  daily 5 days out of 7, omitting 
dasatinib the day prior and the day of  administration of paclitaxel. If this dosing  is 
tolerated, escalation m ay resume  on the  intermittent schedule. 
 
o Similarly, if two or more patients in cohort 1 (paclitaxel 80 mg/m2  and dasatinib 100 
mg  daily continuous ly), experience DLT, then patients will be enrolled at dose level 
+1b, with  paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly and dasatinib 100 mg  daily 5 days out of 7, 
omitting dasatinib the day prior and the day of administration of paclitaxel. If 
this dosing  is tolerated, escalation m ay resume  on the intermittent schedule. 
 
o Similarly, if two or more patients in cohort 2 (paclitaxel 80 mg/m2  and dasatinib 120 
mg  daily continuous ly), experience DLT, then patients will be enrolled at dose level 
+2b, with  paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly and dasatinib 120 mg  daily 5 days out of 7, 
omitting dasatinib the day prior and the day of administration of paclitaxel. If 
this dosing  is tolerated, escalation m ay resume  on the intermittent schedule. 
 
  If only three patients were treated at a dose level under consid eration as the MTD,  then up to 
three addition al patients will be accrued.  If no more than one of the six patients at that dose 
level experiences a DLT, then that dose level will be confirmed as the MTD.  If two or more 
patients in that cohort experience DLT, then the previous  dose level will be studied in the 
same fashion.  
 
 If the MTD  is exceeded at any given dose level on the continuous  schedule, and the previous 
dose-level had only 3 patients in the cohort, than that cohort will be expanded to 6 patients, to 
establish MTD on the  continuous s chedule. 
 
 If greater than or equal to 2 DLTs are experienced by [CONTACT_9084] -1 (with dasatinib 70 mg  daily 5 
days out of 7), then cohort –2 (with dasatinib 50 mg   daily 5 days out of 7) will be under 
consid eration for the M TD. Six patients will be accrued at this level to establish the MTD.  If 
one or less DLTs are experienced by [CONTACT_9084] –2, then this will be consid ered the MTD.  If 2 or 
more DLTs occur within  cohort –2, then the study will be terminated and the IRB will be

5.6  Paclitaxel 
 
Paclitaxel is a  taxane originally derived from the bark of the Pacific yew tree (Taxus Br evifolia ) one 
of the most active and common ly used agents for the treatment of breast carcinoma. Paclitaxel binds 
to the  dimeric tubulin p reventing microtubule  disassembly by [CONTACT_540264][INVESTIGATOR_540217]. This mi crotubule  disruption h alts mitosis,  interferes with oth er critical 
interphase functions and subsequently leads to cell death. 
 
Paclitaxel (as Taxol) is generically available and will not be supplied by [CONTACT_414]-Myers Squibb

Paclitaxel is a  clear colorless to  slightly yellow viscous solution. Paclitaxel is s upplied as a 
non-aqueous solution intended for dilution with a suitable parenteral fluid prior to 
intravenous  
infusion. Paclitaxel is available as 30 mg (5 ml) 100 mg (16.7 ml) and 300 mg (50 ml) 
multiuse vials. 
 
Each mL of sterile nonpyrogenic solution contains 6 mg paclitaxel, 527 mg of purified 
Cremophor® EL and 49.7% of v/v dehydrated alcohol. 
 
5.6.1  Packaging and Labeling - Paclitaxel 
 
Paclitaxel will be supplied as 100 mg (16.7 ml) multi-use vials. Vials will be labeled 
according to the respective country regulations and may contain information regarding 
the product strength, quantity, storage conditions and direction of use. Sites will be 
responsible for recording the label batch number/lot number of the supplies dispensed on 
drug accountability forms. Commercial supply for paclitaxel will be utilized for the study. 
 
5.6.2  Storage Requirements/Stability - Paclitaxel (Taxol)  
 
The Investigator should ensure that the investigational product is stored in accordance 
with the environmental conditions (temperature, light and humidity) as determined by [CONTACT_540265]/reference label. 
 
Unopened vials of Taxol (paclitaxel) injection are stable until the date indicated on the 
package when stored between 20 - 25°C (68 - 77°F), in the original package. Neither 
freezing nor refrigeration adversely affects the stability of the product. Upon refrigeration 
components in the paclitaxel vial may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], but will re-dissolve upon reaching 
room temperature with little or no agitation. 
 
5.6.3  Preparation and Administration - Paclitaxel 
 
Prior to infusion paclitaxel should be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection or 
5% Dextrose injection or 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride or 5% Dextrose in 
ringers lactate to a final concentration of 0.3 to 1.2 mg/mL. Paclitaxel must be prepared 
in glass, polypropylene or polyolefin containers and non-PVC containing (nitroglycerin) 
infusion sets. Prepared solutions are stable at room temperature (20 - 25°C (68 - 77°F)) 
and protected from light, up to 72 hours. In-line filtration with micropore no greater than 
0.22 micron filter is required. Chemo dispensing pin devices or similar devices with

5.6.4  Incompatibilities - Paclitaxel 
 
Data collected for the presence of the extractable plasticizer DEHP [di-(2-ethylhexyl) 
phthalate] show that levels increase with time and concentration when dilutions are 
prepared in PVC containers. Consequently, the use of plasticized PVC containers and 
administration sets is not recommended. Therefore, paclitaxel solutions should be 
prepared and stored in glass, polypropylene, or polyolefin containers. Non-PVC 
containing administration sets, such as polyethylene-lined, should be used.

dasatinib exposure. Therefore, potent inhibito rs of CYP3A4 are prohibit ed during study; for such 
medications, a  wash-out period of  ≥7 days is required prior to starting dasatinib (less pot ent 
inhibito rs, indu cers and subst rates of CYP3A4 are restricted, see section 6 .2.1.2 ). Subjects should be

setting of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. 
 
 
Medications that prolong QT  Interval: 
 
Ideally, subjects enrolled in this study should not begin taking other medications known to 
prolong the QT interval. Information on where to find a partial list of medications known to 
prolong the QT interval is found at http://www.azcert.org/medical-pros/drug-

CYP3A4 Inducers, Inhibitors a nd Substrat es 
 
Caution is warranted when administering dasatinib to subjects taking drugs that are highly 
dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism and have a narrow therapeutic index. (See Appendix 
C). 
 
 
Dasatinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity may decrease dasatinib plasma 
concentrations.  In  patients  in  whom  CYP3A4  indu cers  (eg,  dexamethasone,  ph enytoin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513],  phenobarbital)  are  indicated,  alternative  agents  with  less  enzyme 
induction pot ential shou ld be preferred. 
 
Concomitant use of dasatinib and drugs that inhibit  CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib. 
 
CYP3A4 subst rates known  to have a  narrow therapeutic ind ex such as alfentanil, astemizole, 
terfenadine, cisapride, cyclospo rine, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidin e, sirolimus, tacrolimus,  or ergot 
alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should  be administ ered with caution in patients receiving 
dasatinib. 
 
Potent CYP3A4 inhibit ors are prohibit ed (See Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Less-potent inhibito rs, inducers, and 
subst rates of CYP3A4 are restricted (see also Ap pendix C). 
 
In patients receiving treatment with dasatinib, close monito ring for toxicity and a dasatinib dose 
reduction should  be consid ered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor  cannot be 
avoided. 
 
Subjects should be  advised not to consume  subst antial quantities of grapefruit jui ce. 
 
 
 
Antacids 
 
Nonclinical data demonstrate that the solubi lity of dasatinib is pH dependent. Simultaneous 
administ ration of dasatinib with antacids should  be avoided.  If antacid therapy is needed, the antacid 
dose should  be admini stered at least 2 hours prior to  or 2 hours after the dose of dasatinib. Medicines 
that neutralize stomach acid, such as MAALOX® (aluminum  hydroxide/magnesium  hydroxide),

IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 08-122 A()  
  
TUM S® (calcium carbonate), or ROLAIDS® (calcium carbonate and magnesia) may be taken up to 
2 hou rs before or 2 hou rs after dasatinib. (1) 
  
 
H2 Blockers/Proton  Pump Inhibitors 
 
Long-term suppression  of gastric acid secretion by H 2 blockers or proton pump  inhibito rs (eg, 
famotidine  and  om eprazole) is  lik ely to  reduce  dasatinib  exposure.  The concomitant  use  of H2 
blockers or proton pump  inhibito rs with dasatinib is not recomm ended. The use of antacids should  be 
consid ered in pl ace of H2 blockers or proton pump  inhibito rs in p atients receiving dasatinib th erapy. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] O ther Restrictions and Precautions 
 
Based on pre-clinical data, dasatinib mi ght increase the likelihood of  bleeding. Hence, subjects 
undergoing surgical procedures, including dental procedures, should be  instructed to in form th eir 
doctors of this pot ential increased risk.

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
9.1 Phase I Study 
 
A treatment cycle consis ts of 28 days, according to the  following  schedule: 
 
Agent Route Treatment days Interval Notes 
Dasatinib PO Per cohort  schedule 
(either continuous ly 
or 5 days out of  7) 28 days Daily dose

IRB#: 08-122 A()  
  
 
As explained in Section 4.3, if  the MTD is  with d asatinib < 100 mg  daily given continuous ly, then 
that dose  will be  assessed on 5 d ays per week schedule, correspondi ng to a 28% reduction in tot al 
weekly dose. In that case dasatinib t ablets will be  administ ered [ADDRESS_704186] ration of  
paclitaxel. (i.e. Day 1 paclitaxel, Day 2-6 dasatinib, D ay 7 off). During the week off (4th week of 
every treatment cycle), patients will continue  with d asatinib d aily, stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_187776] d ays prior the 
administ ration of  the next dose  of paclitaxel (Day 1 of following cycle). 
 
The total daily dose of dasatinib should be  taken once daily and m ay be taken with m eals. Patients 
will be  provided with a  diary in which to record study drug intake. Dosi ng times may be adjusted if 
required. If doses are missed for toxicity, they should not be  replaced. If a dose is not t aken due  to an 
error, it m ay be taken up to 12 hou rs later. If vomiting occurs within 30 minut es of intake, that dose 
may be repeated. 
 
Both gastrointestinal tolerance and drug absorption may be improved if dasatinib is taken 
with a light meal; there is no requirement, however, to administer with food. 
Based on pre-clinical data, dasatinib may inhibit platelet aggregation and uncommon 
instances of increased bleeding risk have been observed. Dasatinib should be interrupted 
for 1 day before and 1 - 2 days after any surgical (including dental) procedure or until 
adequate hemostasis is achieved. 
 
Patients will keep a drug diary (Appendix D) to document degree of compli ance with dasatinib 
therapy. For phase I patients within  the first two cycles of treatment, the exact numb er of pi[INVESTIGATOR_540225] [ADDRESS_704187] numb er of pi[INVESTIGATOR_540226] (four weeks) of treatment will be dispensed to patients 
at one  time. 
 
Patients should be  evaluated for signs and symptoms of  underlying cardiopulmon ary disease prior to 
initiating dasatinib and during treatment.  Symptoms of  pulmon ary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
include dyspnea, fatigue, hypoxia, and edema.  Since other medical conditions m ay also cause these 
symptoms, non -invasive procedures (including echocardiogram) should be  done first to rule out mo re 
the common etiologies of these symptoms, su ch as pleural effusion, pulmon ary edema, anemia, and 
lung infiltration.  Right heart catherization can confirm the  diagnosis of  PAH.  Hypertension is “pre- 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]” and not a  consequence of left heart failure or chronic lung disease if there is normal 
pulmon ary capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469] (<15 mm Hg) but elevated pulmon ary artery pressure (mean 
pulmon ary artery pressure >25 mm Hg).  Since PAH m ay be reversible upon dis continu ation of 
dasatinib, a  diagnostic  approach of interruption of  dasatinib t reatment may be consid ered at the 
discreation of  the treating physician; ho wever, if PAH is confirmed, dasatinib should be  permanently 
discontinu ed.

Body surface area (BSA) should be calculated at the start of therapy (Day 1 of Cycle 1). In 
calculating surface areas actual heights and weights should be used; that is, there should 
be no adjustment to “ideal” weight. 
 
Paclitaxel will be administered as a [ADDRESS_704188] meets the re-treatment criteria. The initial dose will 
be 80 mg/m2. 
 
Due to the potential for allergic reactions to paclitaxel and/or the Cremophor vehicle, all 
subjects should be premedicated prior to each paclitaxel administration to prevent or 
reduce the risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions. 
 
• Pre-medicate subject 30 - 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel administration with 
Dexamethasone 10 mg IV, Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV and Cimetidine (300 mg IV) or 
other H2 receptor antagonist (e.g. Ranitidine 50 mg IV). It is also acceptable to utilize 
the investigative sites standard pre-medication regimen for paclitaxel dosing. If no allergic 
reaction occurs after the first 3 doses of paclitaxel, it is acceptable to modify the pre- 
medication regimen at the discretion of the investigator.

solely for the purpose of this research. In the event that a patient has a complete response (CR), 
confirmatory im aging (4 weeks after imaging which documented CR) is requested per RECIST 
criteria. 
 
The du ration of patient treatment will depend on individu al response and tolerance.  Patients with

investigator decision to remove p atient from study. (Definitions  of response, progressive dis ease and 
stable disease are found in Section 12.0 Criteria for Therapeutic Respons e/Outcome Assessment). 
 
All patients who receive at least one full cycle (4 weeks) of dasatinib and paclitaxel will be evaluable 
for response. 
 
9.3 Correlative Studies 
 
Correlative studies will be performed in II portion of the study and will include: 
 
1.   An alysis of  mRNA expression on the  tumor  specimens, for a gene expression profiling of the 
respond ers versus non -respond ers, in o rder to identify potential predictors of response  to 
dasatinib. If differentially interesting candidates emerge, immunohisto chemistry assays 
including  EphA2,  IGFBP2, caveolin and phospho -caveolin and oth er potential predictive 
markers and SFK subst rates as available will also be  performed. 
 
2.  Exploratory tumor biomarker data: assays of p-SRC, VEGFR2, and Collagen Type IV 
(or N-Telopeptide NTX)  in plasma, obtained at baseline and after 2 cycles of 
treatment (8 weeks), will be performed by [CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent assay. 
 
3.  Circulating tumor  cells (CTC) at baseline and after 2 cycles of treatment (8 weeks). 
 
4.   E xploratory somatic gene mutations d etection in archived tumor  samples. 
 
9.3.1  Analysis of  mRNA expression  
Total RNA will be isolated using  TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), passed over a Qiagen RNeasy 
column  (Qiagen,  Valencia,  CA),  and  doub le-stranded  cDNA  will  be  synthesized  by a  chimeric 
oligonucleotide with  an oligo-dT and a T7  RNA polymerase promot er. Reverse transcription  will be 
then carried out, follow ed by [CONTACT_540270] 250 -fold linear amplification by [CONTACT_540271]  (Enzo Biochem, [LOCATION_001], NY). From each sample, ~[ADDRESS_704191] rates as available. These data will be

 previous ly collected peripheral blood mononu clear cells (PBMC) 
 
No suppl ementary biopsy or blood  sampling will be  required for this correlative study, which will use 
previous ly collected samples from the above mentioned correlative studies. Next generation 
sequencing analyses will be performed in the Genomics Core Laboratory. Tumor  specific point 
mutations,  small insertions and deletions,  and somatic rearrangements will be detected by [CONTACT_540275]  (from tumor  tissue  and/plasma) to its paired normal DNA  (from PBMC) and using  a 
series of algorithms  to identify som atic events, as previous ly described (Shah et al, Nature 2012; 
Stephens et al, Nature 2012; Banerji et al, Nature 2012). Germline  information obtained by [CONTACT_540276]. Using comput ational algorithms,  those v ariant calls in the tumor  that are also 
present in the germline  will be removed, or “masked” from output  reports to investigators. VCF or 
other files of germline  data will not be separately analyzed in the future without  addition al informed 
consent, anonymization, and/or  human subj ects review by [CONTACT_1201]. 
 
Once the repertoire of somatic mutations and the mutation allelic frequency of each mutation in 
tumor  tissue  and/or  plasma are defined, we will seek any somatic mutation that may be associated 
with a  specific pattern of sensitivi ty to the  treatments tested in this clinical trial.

 11.0     TOXICI TIES/SIDE EFFECTS 
 
This study will use the NCI C ommon Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 3.0 for toxicity. 
 
 
11.1 Dasa tinib Toxicity 
 
Myelosuppression  
 
Treatment with dasatinib is associated with severe (NCI CTC Grade 3 or 4) thrombo cytopenia, 
neutropenia, and anemia. Their occurrence is more frequent in patients with advanced CML or 
Ph+ ALL than in chronic phase CML. Complete blood  counts  should  be performed weekly for 
the first 2 months  and then month ly thereafter, or as clinically ind icated. Myelosupp ression  was 
generally  reversible  and  usually  managed  by  [CONTACT_540277]. In a Phase 3 dose-optimi zation study in patients with chronic phase CML, Grade 3 or 
4 myelosupp ression  was reported less frequently in patients treated with 100 mg once daily than 
in patients treated with 70 mg  twice daily. (1) 
 
Bleeding Related Events 
 
In addition  to causing th rombo cytopenia in human subjects, dasatinib caused platelet dysfunction 
in vitro. In all clinical studies, severe central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhages, including 
fatalities, occurred in <1% of p atients receiving dasatinib. Severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage 
occurred in 4% of patients and generally required treatment interruptions  and transfusions.  Other 
cases of severe hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients. Most  bleeding events were associated 
with s evere thrombo cytopenia. 
 
Patients were excluded from participation in dasatinib clinical studies if they took  medications 
that inhibit  platelet function or anticoagulants. In some t rials, the use of anticoagulants, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 
and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was allowed concurrently with  dasatinib if 
the pl atelet count was >50,000.  Caution should be exercised if patients are required to take 
medications th at inhibit platelet function or  anticoagulants. (1) 
 
Fluid Retention 
 
Dasatinib is associated with fluid retention.  In all clinical studies, severe fluid retention was 
reported in 8% of patients, including pl eural and pericardial effusion  reported in 5% and 1% of 
patients, respectively. Severe ascites and generalized edema were each reported in <1% of 
patients. Severe pulmonary edema was reported in 1% of patients. Patients who develop 
symptoms  suggestive of pleural effusion  such as dyspnea or dry cough should be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_13190] X-ray. Severe pleural effusion  may require thoracentesis and oxygen therapy. Fluid 
retention events were typi[INVESTIGATOR_540230]. 
 
In the Phase 3 dose-optimi zation study in patients with chronic phase CML, fluid retention 
events were reported less frequently in patients treated with 100 mg once daily than in patients 
treated with 70 mg twice daily. (1) 
Amended: 06/15/15 
- 55 - 
IRB#: 08-122 A (17)  
 The following guidelines may be helpful: 
 
 Chest x-rays are recommended if the subject presents with symptoms  suggestive of pleural 
effusion  
     Early institution  of diuresis – eg, furosemide 20-40 mg po daily  and/or  spi[INVESTIGATOR_540231]  25- 
50 mg  po  d aily, titrate to symptoms  
     Management of symptomatic pleural effusion w ith tho racentesis 
 For   symptom atic   pleural   effusion,   study   drug   interruption   and   administ ration   of 
corticosteroids (e.g. prednison e, 40 mg/day for 3- 5 days, with taper) has been effective in 
some  patients. 
     Dose  reduction m ay be necessary if fluid retention or  pleural effusion is s evere or recurrent 
 Complaints  of  chest  discomfort  -  echocardiogram  should  be  performed  to  investigate 
possible  pericardial effusion 
 Severe or recurrent pleural effusions  – interrupt dosin g, permit recovery to Grade 0-1, and 
restart dosi ng at appropriate dose level 
 
QT Prolongation

Side-effects include alopecia, myelosuppression, fatigue, neuropathy, arthralgia, 
myalgia, 
onycholysis, taste changes, amenorrhea, teratogenesis, hypersensitivity (hypotension, 
flushing, chest pain, abdominal or extremity pain, skin reactions, pruritus, dyspnea, 
bronchospasm, and tachycardia), sinus bradycardia, complete heart block, sinus 
tachycardia,

infarction, hypotension, hypertension, dizziness, visual changes, radiation recall, 
abdominal 
pain, diarrhea, typhlitis, ischemic colitis, abnormal liver function, pancreatitis, abnormal 
triglyceride, and seizures. 
 
11.3 C hemotherapy Delay 
 
Treatment may be delayed no more than 3 weeks to allow recovery from acute toxicity. If 
toxicity requires a dosing delay/interruption  of more than three weeks, the patient will be 
withd rawn from the study for toxicity reasons.  If treatment is delayed for [ADDRESS_704203] not 
progressed, should  continue  paclitaxel until un acceptable toxicity/progression.  These patients 
should be  counted (intent to treat) towards endpoints su ch as progression -free survival. 
 
11.4 Dose  modification for paclitaxel 
 
This stu dy will use  the NCI Common To xicity Criteria (CTC) version 3.[ADDRESS_704204] 
indicated dose  reduction or delay. Dose  re-escalations are not allowed. 
 
o If on the  day that paclitaxel is du e, platelet counts are <100, 000/µL and/or  ANC  
<1,000/ µL and/or  non-hematologic toxicities (excluding  alopecia, fatigue, peripheral 
neuropathy, nausea and arthralgias, and hepatic toxicities, described below) have not 
recovered to Grade 1, treatment should be  delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 1 w eek and CBC and to xicity 
grading repeated weekly.  For hepatic toxicities (including  ALT, AST, and total bilirubin), 
if the patient develops any hepatic grade 3 or 4 toxicity thought to be  related to stu dy 
therapy, paclitaxel may be held until the  toxicity resolves, at the physician’s dis cretion.  If 
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicity have not recovered, a further delay of up to o ne 
week is allowed. If a chemoth erapy treatment delay of >3 consecutive weeks is required, 
the patient will be  removed from the  study. 
 
Other non-hematologic  toxicities: For patients who experience peripheral neuropathy, 
paclitaxel may be dose-reduced followi ng the schema presented in Section 4.3. 
 
o Hypersensitivi ty Reactions: If a hypersensitivi ty reaction occurs symptoms  such as

 interruption of  the infusion.  How ever, severe reactions, su ch as hypotension requiring 
treatment, dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, angioedema or generalized urticaria require 
immediate discontinu ation of  paclitaxel and aggressive  symptom atic therapy.  Patients who 
develop s evere hypersensitivity reactions m ay be re-challenged followi ng premedication

11.5 Dose  modification for dasatinib 
 
11.5.1 Dose  modification for dasatinib in the phase I trial: 
 
See also Section 4.3. D asatinib dose  may be withh eld for any adverse event if the 
investigator feels it is due  to dasatinib, and/or  not well-controlled by [CONTACT_6589], and/or  still 
present at the time of visit. 
 
If the dasatinib w as held for a DLT at Cycle#1, the patient will be  removed from stu dy. If, in 
subsequent cycles, a patient develops a  Grade 2 or 3 adverse event felt to be  related to 
dasatinib, and the  investigator deems the  patient is b enefiting from stu dy therapy, dasatinib 
might be  held and then resumed either at full dos e, or at the reduced dosi ng of the previous 
cohort. 
 
11.5.2 Dose  modification for dasatinib in the phase II trial: 
 
Dasatinib dosage may be adjusted so that any drug-related toxicity is adequately 
managed with outpatient therapy or deemed by [CONTACT_540278]. 
 
The dose adjustment of dasatinib in case of toxicity will follow the dosing schedu le 
schema presented for the phase I portion of the study. For example, if the phase II 
dosing of dasatinib is 120 mg  daily continuous ly, and a patient develops a toxicity related to 
dasatinib, the dosing may be modified as follows: 
 
Grade 
 
0-1 No change 
2 Not adequately managed with outpatient therapy and/or deemed to be 
clinically-unacceptable: decrease one dosing level (to 100 mg daily 
continuous ly) at the physician’s dis cretion 
3 Not adequately managed with outpatient therapy and/or deemed to be 
clinically unacceptable: decrease one dosing level (to 100 mg daily 
continuously) or two dosing levels (to 70 mg daily continuous ly) at 
physician’s dis cretion 
4 Decrease two levels or stop th erapy at the physician’s dis cretion

 12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC R ESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT 
 
All p atients who receive at least one  dose of dasatinib or  paclitaxel will be  evaluable for toxicity. 
All p atients who receive at least one  full cycle of dasatinib and paclitaxel (4 weeks) will be 
evaluable for MTD assessment and respons e. 
 
12.1 Primary Endp oint 
 
 
Phase I Portion 
 
The primary endpoint of  the phase I portion of  the trial is the  maximum to lerated dose (MTD)  of 
dasatinib wh en given in conjun ction with p aclitaxel. The  MTD is d efined as the highest dose 
studied for which the  incidence of DLT is less than 33%. The  MTD will be  determined as 
described in Section 4.[ADDRESS_704205] criteria as described in Appendix E (Response  Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumo rs (RECIST). Only measurable lesions  which have not been irradiated will 
be us ed as indicator lesions.  These must  have a minimum  size of at least one di ameter of 10  mm 
for liver, soft tissue  lesions, lun g, skin and lymph node lesions.

Clinical benefit is d efined as the sum of  the percentage of patients achieving complete 
respons e, partial response and stable disease for greater than 6 months (as defined by 
[CONTACT_13407]) 
     Time  to tumor  progression  
Time  to dis ease progression (TTP) will be  measured from the  start of treatment to the  time 
the patient is first recorded as having disease progression.  If a patient never progresses while 
being followed, the  patient will be  censored at the time he or she terminates the  study or by 
[CONTACT_530116]. Patients who die  without p rogression of  disease will be  censored at time  of 
death. 
     Duration of  response 
Duration of  response is measured from the  time measurement criteria are met for CR/PR 
(whichever is first recorded) until the  first date that recurrent or progressive  disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive  disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
 
A secondary endpoint  of the phase II trial is to assess the overall safety profile of this regimen. 
The toxicity rate will be reported. The type, frequency, severity, timing  and relationship  of each 
toxicity will be  determined as per the NCI Common To xicity Criteria, version 3.  
 
Safety & tolerability measures include but are not limited to:

14.0     BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This is a multi-center (two centers), open-label phase I/II trial with MSKCC serving as the lead 
center. The objective of the phase I portion of the trial is to determine the MTD  of dasatinib 
when given in combin ation with a fixed dose of weekly paclitaxel.  Dasatinib will be dose 
escalated to determine the MTD  using a standard, three-patient per cohort dose escalation 
schedule. The starting d ose of dasatinib is 70 mg d aily, given continuous ly (Dose  level 0).  Three 
dose escalations with 2  schedules (continuous and intermittent) from dose level 0 are possibl e.  If 
the MTD  is with dasatinib < 100 mg daily given continuous ly, then that dose  will be assessed on 
5 days per week schedule, correspondi ng to a 28% reduction in total weekly dose. If tolerated, 
escalation may resume on the intermittent schedule. One dose reduction level has been included, 
if necessary.   Between 6 and 54 patients will be required to determine the MTD  of dasatinib. 
There will be no intrapatient dose escalation.  Details of the dose escalation strategy are provided 
in section 4.3.

calculated for all secondary analyses. 
 
Once the MTD  for dasatinib h as been identified, addition al patients will be  enrolled into the 
Phase II portion of  the study to determine the efficacy and of  dasatinib at the MTD wh en 
administ ered in combin ation with w eekly paclitaxel.  Efficacy will be  measured in t erms of 
response  rate as assessed after two cycles of therapy. The target popul ation for the Phase II 
portion of  the study will be metastatic breast cancer patients who h ave had [ADDRESS_704208] shown th at 
paclitaxel as monotherapy induces response rates ranging from 20 - 50 %. (16, 17) 
However, more recent randomized trials have reported more modest response rates, in 
the range of 14-16%, likely due to the fact that more patients are receiving overall more 
chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting. (18, 19)  Based on these data, we have chosen a 15% 
as the response  rate under which the  therapy of dasatinib with p aclitaxel will not be  consid ered 
for further investigation.  We have chosen a response rate of 30% where the dasatinib with 
paclitaxel regimen will be  consid ered for further study. 
 
 
Simon’s two-stage optim al design will be us ed to test the null  hypothesis of a 15% response  rate 
against the alternative of a 30% response  rate.  Setting both  the Type I and Type II errors at 10%, 
[ADDRESS_704209] a positive  result and this regimen will 
be consid ered worthy of further testing.  For this design, the probability of early termination is 
54% if the true response  probability is < 15%.  Upon completion of the study, the true response 
rate will  be estimated via the obs erved response  rate and an exact confidence interval will be 
constructed. 
 
There are several secondary analyses planned for the Phase II portion of this study.   Selected 
non-hematologic and hematologic toxicities, as measured by [CONTACT_26277] 3.0, will 
be described by [CONTACT_114496], by [CONTACT_540281], with the maximum  grade over 
all cycles used as the summ ary measure per patient.  Clinical benefit will be estimated via the 
observed  rate  and  exact  95%  confidence  interval  while  time  to  tumor  progression  and 
progression free survival will be  estimated using  Kaplan-Meier methodolog y. 
 
For all other secondary endpoints,  such as of p-SRC, VEGFR2, Collagen Type IV, CTC and 
mRNA expression  analysis on tumor  specimens, summ ary statistics such as mean, median, 
counts  and proportions will be calculated.  If required, summ ary statistics will be calculated and 
graphed by [CONTACT_540282].  No formal statistical analysis on t he secondary 
endpoints will be  done.

17.2.1 A dverse Events 
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any unto ward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administ ered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including  an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom,  or disease temporally 
associated with the  use of dasatinib wh ether or not consid ered related to d asatinib. 
 
During clinical trials, adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- 
ended questioni ng, examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, 
subjects should  not be qu estioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more adverse 
events.) 
 
A serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 
     results in d eath, 
 is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe), 
     requires inpatient hospit alization or  causes prolongation of  existing  hospit alization, 
     results in p ersistent or significant dis ability/incapacity, 
     is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
Amended: 06/15/15 
- 65 - 
IRB#: 08-122 A (17)  
      results in the  development of  drug dependency or drug abuse, 
  is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospit alization but, based upon appropriate m edical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention (e.g., medical, 
surgical)  to  prevent  one  of  the  other  serious  outcomes  listed  in  the  d efinition  above.) 
Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive  treatment in an emergency 
room or at home  for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do not 
result in hospit alization.) For reporting purposes, also consid er the occurrences of pregnancy 
or overdose (regardless of adverse out come) as events which must be reported as important 
medical events.

descriptions  of each event will be follow ed by [CONTACT_20444]. Thus,  follow -up information which 
becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as suppo rting documentation (e.g., hospit al 
discharge summ aries and autopsy reports), should  be collected subsequently, if not available 
at the time of the initial report, and immediately sent using  the same procedure as the initial 
SAE report. 
 An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional ingestion of any dose of a product that 
is  consid ered  both  excessive  and  medically  important.    For  reporting  purposes,  BMS 
consid ers an overdose, regardless of adverse outcome, as an impo rtant m edical event. 
 AEs should  be follow ed to resolution  or stabilization, and reported as SAEs if they become 
serious. This also applies to subjects experiencing AEs  that cause interruption  or 
discontinu ation of dasatinib, or those  experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their 
participation in the study; such subjects should  receive post -treatment follow -up as 
appropriate. 
 In  BMS  suppo rted  trials,  all  SAEs  must  be  collected  which  occur  within  30 days  of 
discontinu ation of dosing or completion of the patient’s participation in the study if the last 
scheduled visit occurs at a later time.  In addition,  the Investigator should  notify BMS of any 
SAE that may occur after this time period which they believe to be certainly, probably, or 
possib ly related to dasatinib.

Tumor measurement 
 
 Measurable disease: the presence of at least one measurable lesion.  If the measurable disease 
is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should  be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3973]/histolo gy. 
 Measurable lesions:  lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension  with 
the longest diameter 2.[ADDRESS_704229] be 1.[ADDRESS_704230] 
one dimension.  
 Non-measurable lesions:  all other lesions,  including  small lesions  (longest diameter <2.0 cm 
with conventional techniqu es or <1.[ADDRESS_704231] scans) and other non-measurable 
Amended: 06/15/15

IRB#: 08-122 A (17)  
 lesions.  These include:  bone lesions; l eptom eningeal disease; ascites; pleural/pericardial 
effusion;  inflammatory breast disease; lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis;  abdomin al masses that 
are not confirmed and follow ed by [CONTACT_15218]; and cystic lesions.  
 
All measurements should  be recorded in metric notation, using  a ruler or calipers.  All baseline 
evaluations should  be performed as close as possible to  the treatment start and never more than 4 
weeks before the beginning  of the treatment. 
 
The s ame method of assessment and the same technique should  be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and du ring follow -up. 
 
Clinical lesions  will only be consid ered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodul es, 
palpable lymph nodes).   For the case of skin lesions,  documentation by [CONTACT_310988]  a ruler to estimate the size of the lesions  is recomm ended. 
 
Baseline documentation of target and non-target lesions 
 
 All measurable lesions  up to a maximum  of 10 lesions  representative of all involv ed organs 
should be  identified as target lesions and will be  recorded and m easured at baseline. 
 Target lesions  should  be selected on the basis of their size (lesions  with the longer diameter) 
and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by [CONTACT_540289]). 
 A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions  will be calculated and reported as 
the b aseline sum LD.  The baseline sum  LD will be used as reference to further characterize 
the objective tumor  response of the measurable dimension of  the disease. 
 All other lesions  (or sites of disease) should  be identified as non-target lesions  and should 
also be  recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and these lesions should be 
follow ed as “present” or “absent.” 
 
Response criteria 
 
Evaluation of  target lesions 
 
     Complete response  (CR)disappearance of all target lesions.  
 Partial response  (PR)at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the target  lesions 
taking as reference the baseline sum LD. 
 Progression  (PD)at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of the target lesions  taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one 
or more new lesions.  
 Stable disease (SD)neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum  LD sin ce the treatment started. 
 
Evaluation of  non-target lesions  
 
 Complete response  (CR)disappearance of all non-target lesions  and normalization of tumor 
marker level. 
 Non-complete  response  (non-CR)/non-progression  (non-PD)persistence  of  one  or  more 
non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor  marker level above the normal limits.

of existing  non-target lesions.   Althou gh a clear progression  of non-target  lesions  only is 
exceptional, in such circumstances, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_540237] a review panel (or study chair/primary 
investigator). 
 
Evaluation of  best overall response  
 
 The best overall response is the best response  recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/ recurrence (taking as reference for progressive  disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  In general, the patient’s best response 
assignment will d epend on the  achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

 Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without  objective evidence of dis ease progression  at that time shou ld be reported as 
“symptom atic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinu ation of  treatment. 
 In some  circumstances, it may be difficult to distin guish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of  complete response  depends upon this determination, it is 
recomm ended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before 
confirming the complete response  status.

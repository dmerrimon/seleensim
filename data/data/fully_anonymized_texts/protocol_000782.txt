Phase 1b dose-escalation: 
Subjects with non-small cell lung cancer or subjects with metas tatic melanoma who meet all of 
the eligibility criteria will be  enrolled in the dose-escalatio n portion of the study. 
There will be a maximum of [ADDRESS_629706] 
administration of APX005M and nivo lumab (first 3-week cycle). S afety and tolerability of the 
APX005M and nivolumab combination will be monitored by [CONTACT_489873] a regular basis and prior to each dose  escalation. 
Dose escalation will continue if 0 out of 3 evaluable subjects experience a DLT during the 
DLT observation period (i.e., <33% DLT-evaluable subjects in th at cohort have a DLT). If [ADDRESS_629707] in any DL cohort experiences a DLT, that cohort will be expanded to 
include additional 3 DLT-evaluable subjects (i.e., a total of 6  evaluable subjects). Dose

 escalation will continue if 1 out of  6 evaluable subjects exper ience a DLT during the DLT 
observation period (i.e., <33% DLT-evaluable subjects in that cohort have a DLT). Decision to 
open a new DL cohort will be based on the totality of the data available at that time. 
 The MTD is the maximum dose of  APX005M combined with 360 mg of nivolumab for which 
<33% of DLT-evaluable subj ects experience a DLT.  
 If the DLT rate in DL 3 exceeds 33%, or 2 or more subjects in D L 2 experience a Grade 2 
infusion reaction/cytokine release syndrome, or at the discreti on of the sponsor, the 
intermediate lower dose level 2a  will be evaluated (de-escalation). Up to [ADDRESS_629708] ed, should sponsor decide to 
discontinue dose escalation prior to reaching the MTD. 
The RP2D will be based on the overa ll safety and tolerability o f the combination of APX005M 
and nivolumab.  
 
Phase 2 dose-expansion: 
After identification of the RP2D of APX005M in combination with  nivolumab 360 mg IV 
every 21 days, study will continue with 3 cohorts.  
 Cohort 1: immunotherapy naïve NSCLC (see below) 
 Cohort 2: metastatic melanoma progressing during treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (see below) 
 Cohort 3: metastatic or locally  advanced NSCLC progressing during treatment with 
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (see below)  
o Group A: Subjects with best res ponse of progressive disease or with stable disease 
< 16 weeks 
o Group B: Subjects with tumor res ponse or with stable disease ≥ [ADDRESS_629709] . Subjects that are non-evaluabl e for tumor response will be 
replaced. An ORR (CR+PR) of at least 22% in Cohort 1 and 5% in each of Cohort 2, Cohort 3 
Group A and Cohort 3 Group B is requi red in Stage 1 for the stu dy to proceed to Stage 2. 
Enrollment may continue into Stage 2 while the planned number of subjects for Stage 1 are followed for efficacy. 
In Stage 2, an additional 21 subjects will be enrolled in Cohor t 1 and an additional 25 subjects 
will be enrolled in each of Cohort 2, Cohort 3 Group A and Coho rt 3 Group B.

Study Population 
 
Number of Subjects (planned): 
 Phase 1b: approximately 18 subjects 
 Phase 2: up to 156 subjects Number of Sites: 
 Multisite (approx. 15-20) 
Sample Size Determination:  
The sample size for the Phase 1b dose-escalation cannot be prec isely estimated but depends 
upon the observed toxicities. Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will b e treated at ea ch DL during dose 
escalation portion of the study. It is anticipated that approxi mately 18 subjects will be treated 
in this portion of the study depending on the actual rate of DL Ts. 
Sample size for Phase 2 is calculated using the Simon optimal 2 -stage design: 
 Cohort 1 (inNSCLC): Assumi ng a false positive rate ( ) of 0.1 (one-sided), a false 
negative rate ( ) of 0.1, a response probability of poor drug (P0) of 22% and a  response 
probability of good drug (P1) of 40%, first stage sample size ( n1) is 24 and the 
maximum sample size (n) is 45 response evaluable subjects. 
 Cohort 2 (PD1-MM): Assuming   of 0.1 (one-sided),   of 0.1, P0 5% and P1 of 20%, 
n1 is 12 and n is 37 response evaluable subjects. 
 Cohort 3 (PD1-NSCLC) Gr oup A and Group B: Assuming  of 0.1 (one-sided),   of 
0.1, P0 5% and P1 of 20%, n1 is 12 and n is 37 response evaluab le subjects. 
 
  
Cohort Specific Inc lusion Criteria 
Phase 1b:  Subjects that meet eligibility criteria for Phase 2 Cohorts 1 or 2 and all of the 
general eligibility criteria. Phase 2 Cohort 1:  Histologically or cytologica lly confirmed, immunotherapy naïve ,

APX005M Amendment 4.0 
Date:  October 10, [ADDRESS_629739] immu ne inhibitory molecules has 
shown c linical benefits for patients with various solid tumors such as melanoma, lun g cancer, 
bladder cancer, renal cell carcin oma [1-3]. Currently, both antagon istic monoclonal antibodies 
(mAb) against immune inhibitory molecules such  as cytoto xic T-l ymphocyte associated protein 4 
(CTLA-4) and programmed death  recept or-1 (PD-1)/ programmed d eath-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 
agonistic antibodies against immu ne costimulatory molecules such as CD40 and OX40 are under 
active development for different cancer indica tions and is believed that combination of such 
immunomodulatory agents could lead to a cure for cancer [4]. 
Apexigen has developed th e mAb APX005M, which binds and activates CD40, a costimulatory 
molecule expressed by [CONTACT_22653] (APC). As  such, APX005M is a CD40 agonistic 
antibody. The cell surface molecu
le CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor 
(TNFR) superfamily, plays an importan t role in induction of tumor apoptosis and regulation of 
immune activation, especia
lly in crosstalk between T cells and APCs [5]. CD40 is expressed by 
[CONTACT_405] (DC),  B cells, monocytes,  and some non-lymphoid  cells [6]. The natural ligand 
(CD40L) for CD40 is CD154, which is expressed on activated T cel ls and provides a major 
component of T cell
 “help” for immune response. Agonistic CD40 antibo dies can substitute for 
the function of CD154 on T cells to boost immunity. Signaling through CD40 on APCs, 
including dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, and B cells, can,  in turn, enhance th e T cell response 
via improvement in antigen processing and presentation and throu gh the release of cytokines 
from activated APCs [7, 8]. Therefore, an agonistic CD40 antibod y can activate and stimulate 
both innate and adaptive immunity.  
CD40 is also expressed on many tumor cells and can mediate a direct cytotoxic effect. In addition 
to B cell lymphoma, CD40 expression has been reported in 30−70% of primary human solid 
tumor samples including melanoma and carcinomas 
[9]. Activation  of CD40 on tumor cells 
results in tumor cell apoptosis and inhibition of tumor growth 
[10]. Due to its action  on both 
immu
ne and tumor cells, CD40 has been studied as a target for novel cancer immunotherapy; 
agonistic an
ti-CD40 antibodies have been demonstrated to be potent stimulators of tumor 
immune responses in
 both animal models and cancer subjects [11-14]. 
The p otential mechanisms of action for an agonistic anti-CD40 antibody, depending on its 
isotype, include stimu
lation of immun e response by [CONTACT_489877], recruitment of immu ne effectors such a s natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, 
and direct cytotoxic effects  on tumor cells. Thus, the desired therapeutic CD40 agonist antibody 
should have these functionalities.

1.2.1 Pharmacology 
APX005M is an IgG1 humanized mAb with the S267E mutation at the  Fc region. APX005M 
binds with high affin ity to human CD40 (K d = 1.2 × 10-10 M) and monkey CD40 (K d = 3.5 × 
10−10 M), but does not cross-react w ith mouse or rat CD40. APX005M b locks the binding of 
CD40 to CD40L. The APX005M binding epi[INVESTIGATOR_483094] [ADDRESS_629740] more potent C D40 agonistic activities than 
CD40L-non-blocki ng antibodies [15]. 
Preclinical experiments with APX 005M showed that it activates t he CD40 signaling pathway, 
leading to APC activation, as  demonstrated by [CONTACT_483140]80, CD83, and 
CD86 and by [CONTACT_483141]. As a result 
of APC activation, APX005M enhan ces T-cell proliferation to all oantigen, triggers production of 
IFN- in response to viral antigens, and enhances T-cell response to  tumor antigens. APX005M 
combined with a TLR [ADDRESS_629741] programmed  death ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
synergistically enhances T-cell responses. In comparison with other CD40-agonistic antibodies, 
such as CP-870,893, SGN-40, and ADC-[ADDRESS_629742] on  normal human DC and T-cell 
counts, but could partially reduce B cell counts in vitro. The potential for APX005M to induce 
expression of cytokines was ev aluated with peripheral blood mon onuclear cells (PBMC) 
obtained from normal humans and treatment naïve cynomolgus monk eys, including anti CD3 
antibody as a positive control. C ytokine secretion differed sig nificantly between species with 
much less secretion from monkey P BMCs compared with human PBMCs. These data suggest 
that APX005M is a strong CD40-a gonistic antibody that can activate APCs (DCs, B cells, and 
monocytes) and in turn stim ulate T-cell response. 
The direct cytotoxicity effect  and the antibody effector functi ons such as Antibody-dependent 
cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) of A PX005M were determined in CD40  positive human 
lymphoma xenograft models in m ice. In human lymphoma Ramos mode ls, APX005M was 
capable of inhibiting tumor growt h in a dose-dependent manner, and eradicated established 
tumors at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. A s ignificant anti-tumor effect  was also observed in the 
rituximab-resistant Namalwa mode l [16]. These data suggest that  APX005M, as a single agent, 
can induce potent growth inhibi tion of CD40-expressing human tu mors. 
Preliminary human data shows th at APX005M induces a dose-depend ent activation of APCs (as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_489878]54, CD70, CD80, 
CD86, HLA-DR), T cell activation and increases i n circulating levels of IL12, INF- , TNF- and 
IL6.  
1.2.2 Pharmacokinetics 
Nonclinical pharmacokinetics (PK)  of APX005M were determined in  a Good Laboratory 
Practice (G

nistration of 5 doses of APX005M was well tolerated at  0.3, 3, and 30 mg/kg. The PK
properties of APX005M are typi[INVESTIGATOR_489849] (average range of
0.401–7.27 mL/h/kg), small volume of di stribution (average rang e of 57–80.1 mL/kg), and long
terminal half-life (average >66 hours at 3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg).  Positive anti-drug antibodies
(ADA) titers were observed in all animals in the low-dose group  (0.3 mg/kg) but not in the high-
dose group (30 mg/kg) [16]. Based on these results, the no obse rved adverse effect level
(NOAEL) was considered 30 mg/kg.
There are limited human PK data  with APX005M at this time. Expo sures to APX005M at dose 
levels of 0.03 mg/kg or less were for the most part below the limit of quantitation (BLOQ). IV 
administration of APX005M at doses between 0.1 and 1 mg/kg lead  to rapid increase in serum 
concentrations, reaching a maximum just after the end of the in fusion. Levels declined rapi[INVESTIGATOR_489850] 24 and 168 h ours after the start of dosing. 
Increases in the dose of APX005M  (0.1 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg) led to approximately dose-
proportional increases in max imum serum concentration (C max) and area under the curve at the 
last measurable time point (AUC 0–t). No accumulation of APX005M was observed with every [ADDRESS_629743] i n human phase 1 dose escalation study of APX005M with 8 pre-
planned dose levels. APX005M was administered to study subjects at doses up to 1 mg/kg. At the 1 mg/kg dose level, 1 out of 6 dose limiting toxicity (DLT)-evaluable subjects experienced a DLT (grade 4 cytokine release syndrome). Two additional subject s at the 1mg/kg dose level 
experienced serious adverse events (SAE) in later cycles (Grade  3 cytokine release syndrome 
and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia). On May 2, 2016 Apexigen decided to discontinue dose 
escalation and enroll up to 6 subjects in dose level 0.6 mg/kg (originally designed as an 
intermediate de-esc alation dose level) a nd an additional 3 subj ects at the previously completed 
dose level 0.3 mg/kg to better ch aracterize the safety and phar macodynamics (PDn) of 
APX005M and to help establish the  single agent recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The RP2D 
for APX005M as a single agent every 21 days is 0.3 mg/kg body weight.  
APX005M demonstrated a dose-dependent activation of APCs (as de monstrated by [CONTACT_489879] s such as CD54, CD70, CD80, CD86 , HLA-DR), T cell 
activation and incre ases in circulating l evels of IL12, INF- , TNF- and IL6.

1.2.4 Summary of the Known and Potential Risks and Benefits 
Symptoms associated with cytokin e release syndrome (including b ut not limited to flushing, 
itchiness, chills, fever, rash, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, rigor, and myalgia) after 
administration of APX005M are  possible and have been observed i n some of the subjects 
receiving APX005M. Guidance for m onitoring and management of cytokine release syndrome 
are included in this protocol a nd in the APX005M Investigator’s  Brochure.

nase elevati ons (≤ Grade 2) have been observed in several subje cts with liver 
metastases, which were not asso ciated with a particular dose of  APX005M. Six subjects with 
liver metastases enrolled in the  study experience d a transient increase in total bilirubin. Liver 
function test abnormalities tend to resolve to baseline within [ADDRESS_629745]. Tra nsient decreases in platelet co unts were observed for some of the 
subjects receiving higher doses  of APX005M but were not associa ted with bleeding or other 
clinical manifestations.  Other symptoms might also occur,  including allergic reactions, which could be severe, 
pulmonary edema, and rarely, thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction and/or death. 
In the recently completed Pha se 1 study APX005M-001, APX005M de monstrated a dose-
dependent activation of APCs, T cell activation and increases i n circulating levels of cytokines. 
The biological effects and the ove rall tolerability of APX005M up to 1mg/kg body weight 
suggest a best in class profile  for APX005M and the possibility  of a safe and tolerable 
combination with other immunomodu latory antibodies such as nivo lumab. 
Please refer to the most recent version of the APX005M Investig ator Brochure for the most 
current summary of APX005M to date.  
1.3 Nivolumab 
PD-1 is a member of the CD28 fam ily of T-cell co-stimulatory re ceptors that also includes 
CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, and BTLA [17] . PD-1 signaling has been show n to inhibit CD-28-
mediated upregulation of IL-2, I L-10, IL-13, interferon-γ (IFN- γ) and Bcl-xL. PD-1 expression 
also been noted to inhibit T ce ll activation, and expansion of previously activated cells. Evidence 
for a negative regulatory role of PD-1 comes from studies of PD-1 deficient mice, which develop 
a variety of autoimmune phenotypes [18]. These results suggest that PD-[ADDRESS_629746] genetic factors . Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inh ibition is not accompanied by a 
universal loss of toler ance to self-antigens. 
Nivolumab (BMS-936558, MDX1106) is a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG4 kappa) that targets PD-1. In vitro, nivolum ab binds to PD-1 with high affin ity (EC50 0.39-2.62 nM), and 
inhibits the binding of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 (IC 50  1 nM). Nivolumab binds 
specifically to PD-[ADDRESS_629747] by [CONTACT_489880] a reproducible

or immune response and result in 
tumor rejection in several immunocompetent mouse tumor models ( MC38, SA1/N, and PAN02) 
[19]. 
Nivolumab is investigated both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_489851]. For study details please r efer to the nivolumab 
Investigator’s Brochure [20]. 
1.3.1 Summary of the Known and Potential Risks and Benefits 
Extensive details on the safety pr ofile of nivolumab are availa ble in the Investigator Brochure, 
and will not be repeated herei n. Overall, the safety profile of  nivolumab monotherapy is 
manageable and generally consistent across completed and ongoin g clinical trials with no 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) re ached at any dose tested up to 1 0 mg/kg. Most AEs were low-
grade (Grade 1 to 2) with relativel y few related high-grade (Gr ade 3 to 4) AEs. There was no 
pattern in the incidence, sever ity, or causality of AEs with re spect to nivolumab dose level. 
A pattern of immune-related advers e events has been defined, fo r which management algorithms 
have been developed; these are  provided in the Investigator’s B rochure. Most high-grade events 
were manageable with the use of corticosteroids or hormone repl acement therapy 
(endocrinopathies) as instructe d in these algorithms. Additiona l details on the safety profile of 
nivolumab, including results from other clinical studies, are a lso available in the nivolumab 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
Nivolumab (Opdivo) monotherapy is approved in multiple countrie s, including the US and 
members of the EU, for unresectabl e or metastatic melanoma, pre vious treated metastatic non-
small cell lung cancer and previous ly treated advanced renal cell carcinoma. It is also approved 
for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in the US. IN a ddition, nivolumab has been 
approved for use in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_489852] e melanoma in multiple 
countries, including the US. 
1.4 Rationale for APX005M in C ombination with Nivolumab  
Antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_394220]-1, P D-L1 and CTLA-4 function enh ance anti-tumor immunity, 
leading to durable clinical res ponses for a subset of patients with melanoma, lung cancer and 
other tumor types [21]. However , the majority of patients with melanoma or lung cancer 
continue to have a short respons e or no response to checkpoint blockade thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [22].  
CD40 is a member of the TNFR superfamily, which is expressed on the surface of APCs, plays a 
critical role in the control and regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity against tumors 
[23]. Although phase I studies w ith monotherapy agonistic CD40 antibodies have demonstrated 
objective tumor responses in soli d tumors [24], the greatest po tential for CD40 ac tivation lies in 
the combination with other thera peutic agents. The combination of CD40 agonists with 
chemotherapy (e.g., cell death res ulting in the release of tumo r antigens) ma
y lead to synergistic 
therapeutic effects, as indi cated by [CONTACT_489881] I clinical trials [25, 26].

ion with Fc receptors to media te antibody crosslinking. 
APX005M has demonstrated biolo gical activity in human subjects and a favorable toxicity 
profile when given IV at doses up to 1 mg/kg body weight. 
Recently, Zippelius and co-autho rs [27] showed in preclinical m odels that CD40 engagement 
with an agonistic mAb lead s to a T cell and IFN-  dependent upregulatio n of PD-L1 on tumor 
infiltrating monocytes and macr ophages, thereby [CONTACT_489882] a negative feedback loop, which 
hampers CD40 induced T-cell responses. This resistance mechanis m was successfully 
circumvented by [CONTACT_3252]-administrati on of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. 
Similarly, other groups showed in preclinical models of pancrea tic cancer that CD40 activation 
drove T-cell immunity and reversed the complete resistance of p ancreatic tumors to checkpoint 
blockade. Combining a CD40 agonis tic antibody with PD-1/PD-L1 b lockade enhanced anti-
tumor immunity and improved overall survival versus either mono therapy [28-30]. 
This clinical protocol will e xplore the safety and efficacy of APX005M in combination with 
nivolumab in: 
Subjects with histolog ically or cytologically confirmed, immuno therapy naïve, metastatic
or locally advanced non-small ce ll lung cancer (NSCLC) not amen able to curative
treatment. Subjects may be treat ment naïve or could have received one prior platinum-
based chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer for any indic ation (adjuvant, part of
combined modality therapy or for m etastatic disease) within the  past [ADDRESS_629749] a documented activ ating mutation (e.g. EGFR, ALK,  ROS) amenable to
tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, must also have received the appropriate therapy and
progressed (inNSCLC)
Subjects with histolog ically or cytological ly confirmed unresectable or metastatic
melanoma (MM) that had confirmed progressive disease during treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Subjects with BRAF wild type or unknown status must have received
only anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Subjects with BRAF activating mut ation could have also
received a BRAF inhibitor and/ or MEK inhibitor regimen prior to  anti-PD-1/PD-L1
therapy. Subjects with ocular mel anoma are excluded (PD1-MM).
Subjects with histolog ically or cytological ly confirmed, metast atic or locally advanced
NSCLC not amenable to curative treatment. Subjects must have di sease progression (PD)
on an immediately preceding PD-1/ PD-L1 containing regimen. Subj ects could have
received no more than one plati num containing regimen, or if subjects have a
documented activating mutation ( e.g. EGFR, ALK, ROS) amenable t o tyrosine kinase
inhibitor therapy, must also have
 received the appropriate ther apy and progressed before
the PD-1/PD-L1 containing regimen (PD1-NSCLC).

Phase 1b dose-escalation: 
Subjects with inNSCLC or PD1-MM  who meet all of the general eli gibility criteria will be 
enrolled in the dose-esca lation portion of the study. 
There will be a maximum of 3 e scalation dose levels (DL) and 1 de-escalation dose level in this 
study. The doses of APX005M and min imum number of subjects to b e enrolled in each dose 
level are presented in Table  2. It is expected that up to 18 DL T-evaluable subjects (see definition 
in Section 7.2) will be enrolle d in the dose-escalation portion  of the study over a 6-month period. 
All subjects that are not DLT-ev aluable will be replaced for th e purpose of establishing MTD.

The DLT observation period for  dose escalation is the [ADDRESS_629750] administration 
of APX005M and nivolumab (first 3- week cycle). Safety and toler ability of the APX005M and 
nivolumab combination will be m onitored by [CONTACT_489883] a regular basis and prior to each dose escalat ion. 
Dose escalation will continue if 0 out of 3 evaluable subjects experience a DLT during the DLT 
observation period (i.e., <33% DLT-evaluable subjects in that c ohort have a DLT). If [ADDRESS_629751] in any DL cohor t experiences a DLT, that coho rt will be expanded to include 
additional 3 DLT-evaluable subjects (i.e. a total of 6 evaluabl e subjects). Dose escalation will 
continue if 1 out of 6 evaluable s ubjects experience a DLT duri ng the DLT observation period 
(i.e., <33% DLT-evaluable subjects in that cohort have a DLT). Decision to open a new DL 
cohort will be based on the total ity of the data available at t hat time. 
The MTD is the maximum dose of  APX005M combined with 360 mg of nivolumab for which 
<33% of DLT-evaluable subj ects experience a DLT.  
If the DLT rate in DL 3 exceeds 33%, or 2 or more subjects in D L 2 experience a Grade 2 
infusion reaction/cytokine release syndrome, or at the discreti on of the sponsor, the intermediate 
lower DL 2a will be evaluated (de-escalation). Up to [ADDRESS_629752] DL tested, should sponsor decid e to discontinue dose escalation 
prior to reaching the MTD. 
The RP2D will be based on the overa ll safety and tolerability o f the combination of APX005M 
and nivolumab.  
Phase 2 dose-expansion: 
After identification of the RP2D of APX005M in combination with  nivolumab 360 mg IV every 
21 days, study will continue with 3 cohorts.

 Cohort 2: PD1-MM 
 Cohort 3: PD1-NSCLC 
o Group A

Each cohort and group of the Phase  2 dose-expansion portion of the study will follow a Simon 
optimal 2-stage design. Subjects treated at the RP2D in the dos e-escalation portion will be 
included in Stage 1 of the relevant cohort. Additional subjects will be enrolled for a total of 24

may continue into Stage 2 while the planned number of subjects for Stage 1 are followed for 
efficacy. 
In Stage 2, an additional 21 subjects will be enrolled in Cohor t 1 (inNSCLC) and an additional 
25 subjects will be enrolled in e ach of Cohort 2 (PD1-MM) and C ohort 3 (PD1-NSCLC) Group

2.2.2 APX005M Dose 
APX005M has been administered in the APX005M-001 study to subje cts with solid tumors as a 
single-agent at 7 dose le vels starting at 0.1 g/kg up to 1.0 mg/kg body weight every 21 days. At

 0.6 and 1 mg/kg dose level 1 out of 6 s ubjects experienced a DL T. The RP2D for APX005M as a 
single agent every 21 days is 0.3 mg/kg body weight.  
The proposed starting dose level  for APX005M in this study is 0 .03 mg/kg which is 
approximately [ADDRESS_629775] th e dose of APX005M escalated and received 3 infusions of 0.03 
mg/kg of APX005M. The only AE consid ered as possibl y related to APX005M for all subjects 
receiving 0.03 mg/kg of APX005M w as one event of vomiting (Grad e 1) shortly after the 
administration of APX005M. This do se level was also the lowest to show a PDn effect across 
multiple markers of APC activation measured [ADDRESS_629776] dose level of APX 005M to be tested in combination w ith nivolumab will be 0.3 
mg/kg body weight (Table 1). At a ll dose levels proposed, APX005M has been well tolerated; all 
adverse reactions have been modera te (≤ Grade 2), transient and  easily managed in outpatient 
setting. All available data  suggests that 0.03 mg/kg every 21 d ays is a safe and 
pharmacodynamically active dose of APX005M. 
2.2.3 Nivolumab Dose 
The approved dose of nivolumab i s 240 mg infused over 60 minute s every 2 weeks for NSCLC, 
unresectable or metastatic mela noma and advanced renal cell car cinoma (RCC). In this study, a 
flat dose of 360 mg nivolumab administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes and a dosing 
schedule of every 3 weeks has been selected. Nivolumab has been  shown to be safe and well 
tolerated up to a dose level of 10 mg/kg (Bristol-Myers Squibb,  internal data). Population 
pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab is linear with proportional exposure over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg; no differences in pharmacokinetics 
across ethnicities and tumor types were observed. Using the pop ulation pharmacokinetic model 
developed, the exposures follo wing administration of several dosing regimens of nivolumab 
administered as a flat dose w ere simulated, including 360 mg ad ministered every 3 weeks. The 
simulated steady state average c oncentration following administration of nivolumab 360 mg 
every 3 weeks are expected to be s imilar to those following adm inistration of nivolumab 240 mg 
every 2 weeks and 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks to subjects weighing 80  kg, the approximate median 
weight of subjects with NSCLC, unr esectable or metastatic melan oma and RCC used in the 
population pharmacokinetic analyse s. The steady state peak concentrations following nivolumab 
360 mg every 3 weeks are predicte d to be less th an those follow ing the administration of 
nivolumab 10 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_629777] used a 60 minute infusion duration 
wherein, nivolumab has been saf ely administered up to 10 mg/kg over long treatment periods. 
Infusion reactions including high-grade hypersensitivity reacti ons have been uncommon across 
nivolumab clinical program. I n CA209010, a dose association was  observed for infusion site 
reactions and hypersensitivity r eactions (1.7% at 0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 18.5% at 10

Date:  October 10, 2019 Page 33 of 81  
 mg/kg). All the events were Gr ade 1-2 and were manageable. An i nfusion duration of 30 minutes 
for nivolumab 360 mg is not expected to present any safety concerns compared to the prior 
experience at 10 mg/kg nivoluma b dose infused over a 60 minute duration. The safety of 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg administered a s a 30 minutes infusion was ass essed in subjects (n=322) with 
previously treated a dvanced NSCLC. Overall, there were no clini cally meaningful differences in 
the frequency of hypersensitivity /infusion-related reactions (of any cause or treatment-related) in 
subjects administered nivoluma b over a [ADDRESS_629778]; consented subjects w ho do not receive investigational product will be considered screen 
failures.  
The Apexigen Medical Monitor (o r designee) will review the subj ect’s information before 
enrollment. Only subjects who are  approved by [CONTACT_489885] (or  designee) will 
be allowed to enroll in the study. During normal business days,  a minimum of 24 hours will be 
required for the Apexigen Medical Monitor (or designee) to appr ove a subject for enrollment. 
Additional time may be requi red when approval is sought during a weekend or holiday.  
Subject enrollment into a DL cohort of the Phase 1b dose-escala tion or in the Phase [ADDRESS_629779] stable 
vital signs including: lack of  orthostatic hypotension (systolic blood pressure >100 mmHg, or no 
lower than 10 mm from baseli ne) without IV hydration (no hydrat ion for at least 2 hours prior to

Date:  October 10, [ADDRESS_629780], is defined as 
follows:  
A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being t ested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization 
but used or assembled (formulate d or packaged) in a different w ay than the authorized 
form, or used for an unauthorize d indication, or when used to g ain further information 
about the authorized form. 
In this protocol, the investig ational products are APX005M and nivolumab. 
The Pharmacy Manual contains d etailed information about packagi ng, labeling, storage, 
dispensing, preparation and admin istration of the infusion solu tions of APX005M and 
nivolumab. 
3.2.[ADDRESS_629781] of care for a given diagnosis, are 
considered non-investigational products. 
 
3.3 Timing of Investigational Products Administration 
Investigational pr oducts may be adminis tered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 in 
the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons not  related to study therapy (e.g., 
elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, a nd/or holidays); if retreatment 
criteria are met subjects shoul d restart treatment within [ADDRESS_629782] unless otherwise discu ssed with Apexigen (or designee). Every effort should be made to 
maintain a 21-day dosing schedule. The reason for delay will be documented in the patient's 
study record. 
3.3.1 Nivolumab 
Nivolumab is administered on Day 1 of each 3-week treatment cyc le as a dose of 360 mg using a 
30-minute IV infusion. It is not t o be administered as an IV pu sh or bolus injection. Nivolumab 
injection can be infused undilute d (10 mg/mL) or diluted with 0 .9% Sodium Chloride Injection,

APX005M  Amendment 4.0 
 
Date:  October 10, 2019 Page 35 of 81  
 USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, U SP to protein concentrations as low as 1 mg/mL. Nivolumab 
injections should be adminis tered through a 0.2-micron to 1.2-m icron pore size, low-protein 
binding in-line filter and are compatible with polyvinyl chlori de (PVC) or polyolefin containers 
and infusion sets, and glass bottles.  
Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. 
However, given the variability of  infusion pumps from site to s ite, a window between -5 minutes 
and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 25 minutes  to 40 minutes). The nivolumab 
infusion can be interrupted in t he case of inf usion reaction (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Once symptoms 
resolve, infusion should be resta rted at 50% of the initial inf usion rate (e.g., from 100 mL/hr to 
50 mL/hr). 
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the prep aration of the nivolumab 
infusion and administration of infusion solution. 
3.3.2 APX005M 
APX005M is administered on Day 1 of  each 3-week treatment cycle  approximately 30 minutes 
following nivolumab using a 60 minute IV infusion. Sites should make every effort to target 
infusion timing to be as close to 60 minutes as possible. A window between -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 55 minutes to 70 m inutes). 
 The APX005M infusion can be inter rupted in the case of infusion  reaction (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Once symptoms resolve, infusion should be restarted at 50% of the initial infusion rate (e.g., from 50 mL/hr to 25 mL/hr). A low er infusion rate may be consid ered for patients who 
experience repeated infusion reactions, after discussion with A pexigen Medical Monitor (or 
designee). 
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the prep aration of the APX005M 
infusion and administration of infusion solution.  
3.4 Concomitant Treatments 
[IP_ADDRESS] Premedication Prior to Administr ation of Investigational Produc t 
 
All subjects should be premedicated approximately [ADDRESS_629783] w ith a regimen containing: 
 Oral H1 antagonist (e .g., loratadine 10 mg) 
 Optional oral or IV H2 anta gonist (e.g., ranitidine 150−300 mg,  cimetidine 300−800 mg, 
nizatidine 150−300 mg, and famotidine 20−40 mg) 
 Oral or IV nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (may comprise ib uprofen 400 mg or 
equivalent) 
 Oral or IV acetaminophen 500-650 mg. 
 When the time between premedication and scheduled APX005M admin istration exceeds 4 hours,

APX005M  Amendment 4.0 
 
Date:  October 10, [ADDRESS_629784] experiences a Grade 2 infusion reaction to nivo lumab, subjects may receive an 
additional course of premedication prior to APX005M administrat ion.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescue Medications & Supportive Care Guidelines 
Subjects should receive appropr iate supportive care measures as  deemed necessary by [CONTACT_422515]. Suggeste d supportive care measures for t he management of AEs with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. These treatm ent guidelines are intended to be 
applied when the Investigator determines the events to be relat ed to the APX005M and 
nivolumab combination and should n ot substitute for investigational product dose delays and/or 
modifications (Section 3.7). Additional guidance for management  of AEs with potential 
immunologic etiology is provided in the APX005M and nivolumab I nvestigator’s Brochures. 
If after evaluation the event is determined by [CONTACT_489886], the Investigator 
does not need to follow the treatment guidance outlined in this  section.  
For each disorder, attempts should b e made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease, or 
bacterial/viral infect ion, which might require additional suppo rtive care. 
Steroid tapering may be necessary for prolonged exposures to co rticosteroids, or if symptoms 
worsen when the corticosteroid dose is decreased. 
 Diarrhea/Colitis  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms o f enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or  mucus in stool, with or with out fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal  signs and ileus). All subjects who experience 
diarrhea/colitis shoul d be advised to drink l iberal quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient 
oral fluid intake is not feasib le, fluid and electrolytes shoul d be substituted via IV 
infusion. For Grade 2 or higher di arrhea, consider GI consultat ion and endoscopy to 
confirm or rule out colitis. 
o Grade 1-2:  for subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_14478] 1–2 diarrhea loperamide (2 mg ev ery 2 
hours) is strongly recommended at the first onset of symptoms. For subjects with 
persistent diarrhea despi[INVESTIGATOR_489853], or Grade 2 c olitis, the use of oral 
corticosteroids is recommended. Other antidiarrheal agents (e.g . octreotide) may 
be used if necessary.  
o Grade 3-4: treat with IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_489887] 1 or  less. Add prophylactic antibioti cs for 
opportunistic infections a nd consider lower endoscopy.  
 Creatinine Elevation Due to Inflammatory Causes  
o Grade 2-3:  treat with IV or oral corticosteroids until symptoms improve t o Grade 
1 or less. Consider renal bi opsy with nephrology consult.  
o Grade 4:  treat with IV corticosteroid s followed by [CONTACT_489888] [ADDRESS_629785]. 
 Pneumonitis

 o Grade 2:  request pulmonary and infectious disease consults. Treat with IV or oral 
corticosteroids until symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less. Cons ider 
bronchoscopy, lung biopsy and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
o Grade 3-4:  request pulmonary and infectious  disease consults. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489854]. Administer additiona l anti-
inflammatory measures, as need ed. Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic 
infections. Consider bronchoscopy and lung biopsy.  
 Liver Function Tests 
o Grade 2:  monitor liver function tests mo re frequently until returned to  Grade 1 or 
less. If no improvement in 5-7 days, treat with IV or oral corticosteroids until 
symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less. 
o Grade 3 and 4:  treat with IV corticostero ids for 24-48 hours followed by [CONTACT_489889] 1 or less. If n o improvement in 
3-5 days administer additional immunosuppressive measures (e.g. mycophenolate mofetil), as needed. Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportuni stic infections. 
Consult gastroenterologist.  
 Endocrinopathy 
o Asymptomatic TSH abnormality:  monitor fT4 if TSH is <0.[ADDRESS_629786], > [ADDRESS_629787] or consistently ou t of range in two subsequent measurements. Consider 
endocrinology consult. 
o Symptomatic endocrinopathy: evaluate endocrine function and consider a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_27563]. For abnormal la boratory results/pi[INVESTIGATOR_489855] 1 or less. Initiate appr opriate hormone therapy. For norm al laboratory 
results/pi[INVESTIGATOR_489856] 1-3 weeks and pi[INVESTIGATOR_489857] 1 month. 
o Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_43822]:  rule out sepsis, adminis ter IV fluids. Consult 
endocrinologist and if adrenal c risis is ruled out , treat as for symptomatic 
endocrinopathy. Otherwise, adminis ter stress dose of IV steroids with 
mineralocorticoid activity.  
 Skin Adverse Events  
o Grade 1-2: symptomatic treatment (e.g. antih istamines, topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826]). For 
persistent (>1-2 weeks) or recurre nt symptoms consider skin bio psy and treatment 
delay.  
o Grade 3-4: consider skin biopsy and consult derm 
atologist. Treat with IV 
corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_489890] 
1 or less.   
 Infusion Reaction/Cytokine Release Syndrome 
Precautions should be observed during the administration of APX005M and nivolumab. 
Emergency agents including oxygen , oral and endotracheal airways, intubation 
equipment epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihis tamines, and corticosteroids shou ld be available and used 
if required at the Inve stigator’s discretion.

Predose blood samples can be  collected up to 72 hours in advance. 
Immune PDn testing might include but would not be limited to: 
Analysis of APC activation: non-manipulated peripheral blo od lymphocytes will be analyzed 
using flow cytometry to measure cell surface immune markers of peripheral blood B cells and 
DCs, such as, but not limited to, CD19, CD123, CD11c, CD86, maj or histocompatibility 
complex class I and II, CD70, and CD54. Dead cells are excluded  using 7-AAD and non-B cells 
or non-DC are excluded using a panel of mAb, all analyzed on a “dump” channel.  
Analysis of T-cell activation: together with complete blood count differentials, flow cytomet ry 
of peripheral blood will be used to measure both the percentage s and absolute count (cells/mm3) 
of important T cell subsets  defined by [CONTACT_137766][INVESTIGATOR_007], such as total CD3+ cells, CD3+ 
CD8+ T cells, CD3+ CD4+ T cells, and CD3+ CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. For each subset, 
differentiation status (e.g. naïv e, central memory, and effecto r memory) or activ ation status will 
be assessed using additional marker s including CD45RA, CD45RO, CCR7, CD28, CD27, CD57, 
CD25, CD69, HLA-DR, CTLA4, Eomes , granzyme B, Ki-67, CD154, and  PD-1. When possible, 
trends can be tracked in T cell subsets based on analysis of mu ltiple post-treatment samples. NK 
cell subsets can als o be assessed using CD16 and CD56, with CD6 9 as an activation marker. 
Analysis of T and/or B clonotype  changes: the clonotypic compos ition of the T and/or B cell 
repertoire will be assessed by T and/or B cell receptor sequenc ing performed on PBMCs. T 
and/or B cell clonotype evolut ion will be assessed at baseline,  one certain treatment cycles, and 
at EOT. 
5.6.4 APX005M Anti-drug Antibody 
In Phase 1b blood samples for ant i-APX005M antibodies will be c ollected before dosing on 
Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, and at the EOT visit.

cycle (e.g., Cycles 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, etc .) and at the EOT visit. 
5.6.5 Tumor Biomarkers 
Archived or fresh tumor tissue will be obtained from all subjects in this study. Submission of 
formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue sample blocks are  preferred; if submitting 
unstained slides, the slides should be freshly cut and submitte d to the testing lab oratory within [ADDRESS_629833] scheduled 
tumor assessment (during Cycle 3, at approximately 7–[ADDRESS_629834] of investigational produc t). A minimum of 24 subjects ( 6 subjects with each 
cohort/group) must consent to fresh core biopsies.  
Samples might be analyzed by [CONTACT_489899], Ma sson’s trichrome, and by 
[CONTACT_489900], but not limited to: 
 Immune markers (e.g., PD-L1, C D40, CD45, CD68, CD3, CD8, CD4, F oxp3, CD20, and 
myeloperoxidase) 
 Tumor markers (e.g., EpCAM, K i-67, and cleaved caspase 3) 
 Vascular markers (e.g., CD31) 
 Stromal markers (e.g., collagen type I) 
If sufficient material is availa ble, cell suspensions of tumor will be studied by [CONTACT_489901][INVESTIGATOR_007]. Tumor samples and peripheral blood  may also be examined for 
gene expression (e.g. Quantigene), T and B cell receptor repert oire assessment by [CONTACT_489902], and somatic tumor mutations. Data will be analyzed to examine specific hypotheses 
about whether drug response is r elated to alterations in gene r egulation. These data will also be

The AE definitions and reporting pr ocedures provi ded in this pr otocol comply with current 21 
Code of Federal Regulations P art 312.32. The Medical Monitor as signed by [CONTACT_483156] (or 
designee) must promptly review a ll information relevant to the safety of the investigational 
product received from any source . The Investigator or appropria tely qualified designee (e.g., a 
certified nurse practitioner or phys ician’s assistant properly listed on the Form FDA 1572) will 
carefully monitor each subject  throughout the study for possibl e AEs.

 6.1 Definitions 
6.1.1 Adverse Event 
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence associ ated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not c onsidered drug related. 
6.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction 
Suspected adverse reaction (SAR)  means any AE for which there i s a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the AE. For the pur poses of IND safety reporting, "reasonable possibility" means 
there is evidence to suggest a ca usal relationship between the drug and the AE. SAR implies a 
lesser degree of certainty about  causality than adverse reactio n, which means any AE caused by a 
drug. 
6.1.3 Life-threatening AE or Life-threatening SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered "lif e-threatening" if, in the view o f either the Investigator or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immedi ate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE or SAR that, had it  occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
6.1.4 Serious AE or Serious SAR 
An AE or SAR is considered "serious" (SAE or SSAR) if, in the v iew of either the Investigator 
or sponsor, it results in a ny of the following outcomes: 
 Death 
 A life-threatening AE 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64005] 
 A persistent or significant incap acity or substantial disruptio n of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120279], based upon appr opriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or s ubject and may require medical o r surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such  medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
6.1.5 Unexpected AE or Unexpected SAR 
An AE or SAR is considered "unexpected" if it is  not listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or seve rity that has been observed; o r, if an Investigator Brochure is not 
required or available, is not cons istent with the risk informat ion described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewh ere in the current application, a s amended. For example, under this 
definition, hepatic necrosis w ould be unexpected (by [CONTACT_489903]) if  the Investigator 
brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis . Similarly, cerebral 
Apexigen, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL APX005M-002 Clinical Protocol 
APX005M  Amendment 4.0 
 
Date:  October 10, 2019 Page 61 of 81  
 thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would b e unexpected (by  [CONTACT_14214]) 
if the Investigator Brochure list ed only cerebral vascular acci dents. "Unexpected," as used in this 
definition, also refers to AEs or  SARs that are mentioned in th e Investigator’s Brochure as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the phar macological properties of the drug, 
but are not specifically mentione d as occurring with the partic ular drug under investigation. 
6.1.6 Overdose 
For this trial, an overdose will be defined as APX005M >1 mg/kg body weight or nivolumab 
≥[ADDRESS_629835] be discussed with Apexigen M edical Monitor (or designee). 
 
6.2 Adverse Event Classification 
6.2.1 Relationship to Investigational Products 
The Investigator will assign a ttribution of the possible associ ation of the event with use of the 
investigational products, and this information will be entered into electronic data capture (EDC) 
system using the classifica tion system listed below:  
Related to Investigational Product  
The event is suspected to be related if: 
 There is a clinically plausible  time sequence between the AE on set and administration of 
investigational product 
 There is a biologically plausible  mechanism for the investigati onal product to cause or 
contribute to the AE 
 The event improves or diminishes upon temporary interruption of the investigational 
product without the initiation of  any specific treatment for th e event (dose delay) and/or 
recurs or worsens when resuming t reatment after criteria for re treatment are met 
 The AE cannot be reasonably attributed to concu rrent or underly ing illness, other drugs, 
or procedures 
Apexigen Medical Monitor (or de signee) will review all Investig ator-reported assessments of 
relationship and confirm.  
Unrelated to Investigational Product  
The event is not suspected to be related if: 
Apexigen, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL APX005M-002 Clinical Protocol 
APX005M  Amendment 4.0 
 
Date:  October 10, 2019 Page 62 of 81  
  The AE is more likely to be e xplained by [CONTACT_423]’s underlyi ng disease, clinical state, 
concomitant medical, or study or non-study procedure 
 The time occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related to administration of 
investigational product 
 The event is not related to the investigational product 
6.2.2 Severity 
The NCI-CTCAE v 4.03 will be used to describe the event and to assess the severity of AEs. For 
AEs not adequately addressed i n the NCI-CTCAE  version 4.03, Tab le 6 should be used. 
Table 6: Toxicity Grading for A Es Not Covered in NCI-CTCAE (Ver sion 4.03) 
Severity Description 
GRADE 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagno stic observations only; 
intervention not indicated 
GRADE 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention in dicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of ADL* 
GRADE 3 Severe; medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self-care ADL** 
GRADE 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indi cated 
GRADE 5 Death related to AE 
Abbreviations: ADL = activities of  daily living. Semi-colon ind icates “or” within the description 
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_221872], using t he telephone, managing 
money, etc. 
**Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feed ing self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden 
 
Abnormal laboratory findings shoul d be reported as AEs only if they are clinically relevant (see 
Section 6.3.6). 
AE will be reported at the highe st grade experienced. AEs which  completely resolve and then 
recur will be recorded as a new AE. 
6.[ADDRESS_629836] medical histor y; events that start  after the first 
dose of investigational product will be recorded as AEs. In add ition, the Investigator should 
report any AEs that may occur after this time period which are assessed to have a reasonable 
possibility of being associated with inves tigational products.

each AE includes event, durati on (start and end dates), start t ime (for events occurring within 48 
hours after the start of APX005M i nfusion) severity, seriousnes s, causality to i nvestigational 
product, action taken, and outcome . Whenever possible, reportin g specific diagnosis is preferred 
when reporting AEs in the AE eCRF  rather than reporting individ ual signs and symptoms except 
for infusion related reactions a nd cytokine release syndrome.  
All AEs that are considered rel ated to investigational products  must be followed to resolution, 
stabilization, until improvement is not expected, [ADDRESS_629838]’s source file. AEs continuing at [ADDRESS_629839] ensure that these sub investigators are qualified to 
perform these duties under the s upervision of the Investigator and that they are listed on the FDA 
Form 1572. 
6.3.2 Disease Progression 
Disease progression will be docum ented in an eCRF intended to c apture such information. Signs 
and symptoms related to disease progression should be reported in the appropriate eCRF as an 
AE or as a SAE if applicable. Verbatim terms such as “disease progression,” “progressive 
disease,” etc. should not be repor ted as AEs or SAEs unless the Investigator considers the 
progression to be atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], acce lerated, or caused by [CONTACT_489904]. Similarly, 
death occurring as a result of di sease progression should be reported on the eCRF intended to 
capture death information and should not be reported as an SAE.  
 
6.3.3 Serious AEs or Serious SARs 
Apexigen (or designee) must be notified of the occurrence of an y SAE/SSAR within 24 hours of 
Investigator’s knowledge of the e vent. The SAE/SSAR will be rep orted by [CONTACT_489905]/SSAR report form by: 
[INVESTIGATOR_49852]:  [EMAIL_9389]  
If only limited information is in itially available, follow-up r eports are required and must be 
submitted in a timely fashion as additional information becomes  available. The immediate and 
follow-up reports should identify subjects by [CONTACT_489906]' na mes, personal identification num bers, and/or addresses. 
The Investigator should also com ply with the applicable regulat ory requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs/SSARs to the reg ulatory authorities and the I nstitutional Review Board

 (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committ ee (IEC). The sponsor may reque st additional source 
documentation pertaining to the SAE /SSAR from the investigational site. If a subject is 
permanently withdrawn from the study due to an SAE/SSAR, this i nformation must be included 
in the initial or follow up S AE/SSAR report in the eCRF. 
The sponsor is responsible for  notifying the appropriate health  authorities of serious and 
unexpected SAR (S[LOCATION_003]R) through expe dited IND safety reports (IS R) in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations. 
6.3.4 Handling of Expedited  Safety Reports 
Apexigen (or designee) will notif y Investigators of all ISRs. U pon receiving an ISR from 
Apexigen (or designee), the Inve stigator must review and retain  the ISR with the Investigator’s 
Brochure. Where required by [CONTACT_5737] r egulations or when there is a central IRB/IEC for the study, 
Apexigen (or designee) will submit the ISR to the appropriate I RB/IEC. The Investigator and 
IRB/IEC will determine if the i nformed consent requires revisio n. The Investigator should also 
comply with the IRB/IEC proce dures for reporting any other safe ty information. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_629840]’s written  consent to participate in the 
study: AEs that occur after cons ent, but prior to the first dos e should be recorded as Medical 
History. If an ongoing AE changes in its intensity or in its pe rceived relationship to 
investigational product, a new AE entry for the event should be completed. AEs should be 
followed to resolution, stabiliz ation, a minimum of [ADDRESS_629841] values capture d as part of the study should be recorded on the a ppropriate pages 
of the eCRF. Laboratory abnormalities that meet any of the foll owing criteria will also be 
captured on the AE or SAE reportin g eCRF page as appropriate: 
 Require the subject to have any of the investigational products discontinued, delayed, or 
interrupted 
 Require the subject to receive  specific corrective therapy 
 Are clinically significant

7. Statistics 
7.1  Sample Size Determination  
This is a Phase 1b-2, study. The s ample size for the Phase 1b d ose-escalation cannot be precisely 
estimated but depends upon the obs erved toxicities. Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be treated at 
each DL during dose escalation por tion of the study. It is anti cipated that approximately 18 
subjects will be treated in t his portion of the study depending  on the actual rate of DLTs. 
Sample size for Phase 2 is calculated using the Simon optimal 2 -stage design [32]: 
 Cohort 1 (inNSCLC): Assumi ng a false positive rate ( ) of 0.1 (one-sided), a false 
negative rate ( ) of 0.1, a response probability of poor drug (P0) of 22% and a  response 
probability of good drug (P1) of 40%, first stage sample size (n1) is 24 and the maximum 
sample size (n) is [ADDRESS_629845]  stage, if there are 5 or less 
responses in 24 subjects, the en rollment in this cohort will be  stopped. Otherwise, if 6 or 
more responses are observed, 21 additional subjects will be acc rued in Stage 2 for total of 
45. Enrollment may continue into S tage 2 while the planned numb er of subjects for Stage 
1 are followed for efficacy. By [CONTACT_281818] 2, if 13 or le ss responses are observed in 
45 subjects, then no further inves tigation is warranted. If 14 or more responses are 
observed, the null hypothesis will be rejected and true RR is 4 0%. 
The sample size of 45 subjects , provides 97% power to statistic ally test the null 
hypothesis of historical 6-month PFS rate (PFSR) of 60% (estima ted for pembrolizumab 
in Keynote-024 [33]) versus the a lternative hypothesis of 6-mon th PFSR rate of 80%. 
This calculation assumes exponential PFS, 1-sided 5% type I error rate, enrollment of subjects for 8 months with 6 mont hs of follow-up prior to conducting the final analysis.

  Cohort 2 (PD1-MM): Assuming   of 0.1 (one-sided),   of 0.1, P0 5% and P1 of 20%, n1 
is [ADDRESS_629846] igation is warranted. If 4 or more responses are observed, 
the null hypothesis will be  rejected and true RR is 20%. 
The sample size of 37 subjects , provides 92% power to statistic ally test the null 
hypothesis of historical 6-month PFSR of 19% (estimated for ipi [INVESTIGATOR_489866] [34]) versus the alternative hypothe sis of 6-month PFSR 
rate of 38%. This calculation assumes exponential PFS, 1-sided 5% type I error rate, enrollment of subjects for 8 months with 6 months of follow-up prior to conducting the 
final analysis. 
 Cohort 3 (PD1-NSCLC) Gr oup A and Group B: Assuming  of 0.1 (one-sided),   of 0.1, 
P0 5% and P1 of 20%, n1 is [ADDRESS_629847] stage, if there are no responses in 12 subjects, the enrollment in that group will be stopped. Otherwise, if 1 or m ore responses are observed, 25 additional subjects will be 
accrued in Stage 2 for total of 37 per group. Enrollment may co ntinue into Stage 2 while 
the planned number of subjects fo r Stage 1 are followed for eff icacy. By [CONTACT_281818] 
2, if 3 or less responses are  observed in 37 subjects, then no further investigation is 
warranted. If 4 or more respons es are observed, the null hypoth esis will be rejected and 
true RR is 20%. 
The sample size of 37 subjects/ group, provides 94% power to sta tistically test the null 
hypothesis of historical 6-month PFSR of 22% (estimated for che motherapy regimens 
[35, 36]) versus the alternativ e hypothesis of 6-month PFSR rat e of 43%. This calculation 
assumes exponential PFS, 1-sided 5% type I error rate, enrollme nt of subjects for [ADDRESS_629848] 21 days (i.e., 
subject does not come off study f or reasons other than toxicity). 
Subjects evaluable for efficacy (tumor response) are defined as  those who meet study eligibility 
criteria and have at least one on t reatment (post baseline) tumor assessment. 
Subjects evaluable for PK are de fined as those who have adequate APX005M serum 
concentration-versus-time data  to allow proper estimation of PK  parameters.

 The MTD is maximum dose for wh ich <33% of DLT-evaluable subject s experience a DLT. 
The RP2D will be taking into account the MTD of APX005M (if applicable), as well as the 
nature, severity and causal rela tionship for all AEs. Prior to establishing the RP 2D all subjects 
enrolled in the phase [ADDRESS_629851]. ORR (and 90% 
confidence interval by [CONTACT_489908]), DOR and PFS (Kaplan -Meier estimate) will be 
estimated for each cohort/group and for each tumor assessment m ethod. Additional details will 
be provided in the Stati stical Analysis Plan. 
7.4.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Blood samples will be collected from all subjects for determina tion of serum concentrations of 
APX005M at time points specified in Section 5.6.1.  
PK parameters of APX005M will be determined using model-indepen dent methods. The 
following parameters will be cal culated whenever practical: 
 
Parameter  Description  
tmax Time from the start of dosing at which the maximum concentratio n was observed.
Cmax Maximum observed concentration.
Cmax/D Dose-normalized C max.
AUC 0–t Area under the concentration vers us time curve from the start of dose administration to 
the last quantifiable point within the dosing interval.
AUC 0– Area under the concentration vers us time curve for the dosing i nterval, using the 
trapezoidal rule.  
AUC 0–/D Dose-normalized AUC 0–.
 
When the concentration-time data permit, the slope of the terminal phase of each individual concentration versus time curve (λ
z) will be determined by [CONTACT_26500]-linear  regression for the first and  
third doses, and the following additional parameters will be es timated.  
 
Parameter  Description  
t1/2 Terminal half-life.  
AUC 0– Area under the concentration vers us time curve from the start of dose administration to 
infinity, using the trapezo idal rule (first dose only).
CL Total body clearance, calculated as D/AUC 0– (first dose only).  
Vz Terminal volume of distribution, calculated as CL/λ z (first dose only).  
 Steady-state achievement will be assessed by [CONTACT_489909]-of-infusion 
concentrations on Cycles  2, 3, and 4. Accumulation on Cycle 3 w ill be assessed by [CONTACT_489910]
0– and C max of the third and first doses and comparing predose concentrations of Cycles 3 
to the predose sample of Cycle 2. Pharmacokinetic linearity will be examined by [CONTACT_489911], Inc. CONFIDENTIAL APX005M-002 Clinical Protocol

8.[ADDRESS_629856] diaries, laboratory reports, and 
other documents. Apexigen (or de signee) will supply the eCRF, w hich will be completed in 
English. 
Data collection will involve the use of the EDC system, to whic h only authorized personnel will 
have access. The Investigator or designee must enter all results collected d uring the clinical study into eCRFs. 
Guidelines for completion of eCRFs will be reviewed with study site personnel at the site 
initiation visits. Investigators are responsible for approval o f the entered/corrected data. Detailed 
instructions may be found in the  other study-specific documents . 
All entries made on the eCRF must be verifiable against source documents. In addition to 
periodic monitoring occurring within the system by [CONTACT_489917], programmatic edit checks 
and data listings will be used to review the data for completen ess, logic, and adherence to study 
protocol. As a result of this m onitoring and these checks and q ueries may be electronically issued 
to the clinical study sites and electronically resolved by [CONTACT_120892] e sites. 
All data collected in the contex t of this study will be stored and evaluated per regulatory 
requirements and applicable guidanc e for electronic records. Al so, data will be stored and 
evaluated in such a way as to assure subject confidentiality in  accordance with the legal and 
regulatory requirements applying to protected health informatio n. Study records (e.g., copi[INVESTIGATOR_489869]) will be retained at the study s ite, along with adequate source 
documentation. The study file and all source data should be ret ained for the time period required 
by [CONTACT_489918] (or designee)  for destruction.

Investigational 
device to screen for 
FGFR2 fusions
(Substudy 1) :The FGFR2 break -apart FISH Probe Kit test will be used to detect 
gene fusions, also referred to as rearrangements, involving the 
FGFR2 gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 
formalin- fixed paraffin- embedded (FFPE) primary liver cancer 
specimens, including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) 
tissue samples to aid in identifying or confirming patients’ 
eligibility for treatment with derazantinib.
Tissue samples will be sent to ARUP laboratories, which is the 
Sponsor`s central laboratory ,for FISH testing. Tumor samples 
may be analyzed at other laboratories identified by [CONTACT_806450] (GAs) and 
molecular markers predictive of response.
Pre-screening results obtained from tests performed by [CONTACT_81564] (‘local testing ’)detailed in Section 6.8may enable treatment 
initiation prior to central confirmation of FGFR2 fusions.

Substudy 2 w ill use a Simon’s two-stage design ,with 
approximately 15 mITT -evaluable patients in Stage 1, and an 
additional 28mITT -evaluable patients if the study proceeds to 
Stage 2.
Patient eligibility may be assessed in two steps: 
1) Molecular pre -screening to confirm FGFR2 GA status (FGFR2
fusions
,or FGFR2 mutations /amplifications ; see Table 1and 
Table 2,and Appendix 8)using validated/ approved genetic 
testing devices ; and 
2) Clinical screening procedures to confirm study treatment 
eligibility once molecular eligibility is confirmed by [CONTACT_7879]’s 
FGFR2 GA status.  
Molecular pre-screening for FGFR2 fusions in Substudy 1may 
be based on local or central testing. If pre -screening is performed 
based on a local test, then a central confirmation by [CONTACT_412300]2
break -apart FISH Probe Kit test is required for Substudy 1 
(FGFR2 fusions). 
Molecular pre-screening forFGFR2 mutations/ amplifications in 
Substudy 2should be based onNGS testing (for details, see
Table 2and Appendix 8)performed or commissioned by [CONTACT_806460] .
Patients may be prescreened for the tumor’s FGFR2 GA status 
(prior to initiation of or during ongoing systemic therapy). If the 
patient is still receiving prior systemic therapy, clinical screening 
procedures will be delayed until radiographically confirmed 
disease progression or intolerance to the ongoing systemic 
therapy is documented. After the study treatment eligibility is 
confirmed, patients will be enrolled and treated with continuous 
300 mg once daily (QD) dosing of derazantinib capsules. 
Atreatment cycle is defined as [ADDRESS_1113095] cycle (Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15) and once 
every cycle thereafter (Day 1 of each cycle).  
Tumor measurements will be done at Screening (within 28days 
prior to the first dose of derazantinib), once every 8weeks 
(two cycles) from the day of the first dose for the first sixcycles, 
and once every 12 weeks (three cycles) thereafter. For patients 
with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), the 
Investig ator should perform a confirmation tumor measurement 
4to 5 weeks after the scan showing PR or CR. For patients with 
progressive disease (PD) per Investigator assessment, a central

radiology reviewer confirmation should be received prior to the 
patient’s discontinuation from the study treatment if progression 
is seen on the first or second on-treatment scan. Patients who 
discontinue study drug for a reason other than radiographic 
disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, or loss to 
follow -up should continue tumor evaluation visits if possible 
every 8–[ADDRESS_1113096] 
to follow -up.
Pharmacodynamic assessmen t will include evaluation of tumor 
marker s (CA19.9, CA125, CEA), biomarkers (FGF19, FGF21, 
FGF23), and cell-free circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid 
(ctDNA). Blood samples for PD assessments will be collected 
only from patients enrolled after completion of the interim 
analysis, and subject tothe granting of appropriate regulatory and 
IRB/IEC approval .
Archival tumor tissue samples will be obtained forall patients to 
enable additional molecular analyses with regard to the identified 
GAs and markers predictive of response at the laboratories 
selected by [CONTACT_1034] (see Section 6.8).
The PopPK parameters of derazantinib will be determined. 
Exploratory assessments of metabolites of derazantinib may also 
be investigated .All patients will be scheduled for sparse PK 
sampling. A subset of up to 20 patien ts (PK subgroup) will be 
asked to participate in rich PK sampling and/or urinary PK 
sampling (see Section 6.6 ).
HRQOL and sy mptom response will also be measured. 
Safety follow -up will be conducted at least [ADDRESS_1113097] dose of study medication.  Safety 
follow -up will include collection of adverse events (AEs) and 
changes in concomitant medication.  
Central reading of all electrocardiogram (ECG )results will be 
performed (for details, see Section 6.4 ).
Survival follow -up will continue until the study has completed or 
other discontinuation criteria are met.

agree to avoid becoming pregnant or impregnating a partner, 
respectively, during the study*, and for at least [ADDRESS_1113101] azoospermia (whether due to vasectomy 
or an underlying medical condition). Female patients are 
considered not to be of child-producing potential if they are:
postmenopausal†, or
have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, 
bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_108611]/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening, or 
have a congenital or acquire d condition that prevents 
childbearing.
Male or female patients of child- producing potential must 
agree to comply with one of the following until at least 
[ADDRESS_1113102] dose of derazantinib:
a)Abstinence from heterosexual activity‡
b)Using (or having their partner use) a highly effective 
method of contraception during heterosexual activity. 
Highly effective methods of contraception are§:
an intrauterine device (IUD)
vasectomy of a female patient’s male partner
a contraceptive rod implanted into 
the skin
combined (estrogen -and progestogen- containing) or 
progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation (oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] 
[estrogen/progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870] -only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]]
contraceptive skin patch/implant, vaginal 
contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous contraceptive 
injection)
*From the day of first study medication, or for oral contraception from [ADDRESS_1113103] study medication. 
†Postmenopausal is defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause; in women 
< 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may  be used to 
confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is n ot sufficient.
‡Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is consistently 
employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifesty le and if it is employed during the entire period of risk 
associated with the study treatment and if it is considered highly effective by [CONTACT_799454]/IRBs. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mpto -thermal, post -ovulation methods, etc.) and 
withdrawal are not highly effective methods of c ontraception.
§If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, then it does not qualify as a highly 
effecive method of contraception for subjects participating at sites in this country/region.

administration: Derazantinib will be supplied as 100 mg capsules.
A dose of 300 mg QD (three capsules of 100 mg each) of 
derazantinib will be administered by [CONTACT_1966] 1 hour before , or 
2hours a fter, a meal.
Duration of 
treatment: It is expected that most patients will receive between one and 
eight months of treatment with derazantinib capsules.
Patients will receive treatment with derazantinib capsules until 
death, radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 
until another of the specified criteria is met for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374].  
Radiographic progressive disease must be confirmed by [CONTACT_806468]- treatment scan. 
In Substudy 1, if the locally -documented FGFR2 fusion positive 
status was tested and not confirmed by [CONTACT_806469], these patients will be assessed on a case-by- case 
basis (see Section 5.7.1 ).
For patients who demonstrate continued benefit from receiving 
derazantinib at the time of study closure , the Sponsor aims to 
provide continued individual patient access to derazantinib, 
e.g.,under a rollover study protocol, or in the context of 
compassionate use / named -patient access where applicable .
Pharmacokinetic 
and 
pharmacodynamic 
variables:Blood samples for PD assessments of tumor markers (CA19.9, 
CA125, CEA), biomarkers (FGF19, FGF21, FGF23) and ctDNA 
will be collected and evaluated in batches either during, or at the 
end of, the study (see Section 6.7 ). 
Blood samples for PD assessments will be collected only from 
patients enrolled after completion of the interim analysis, and 
subject to the granting of appropriate regulatory and IRB/IEC
approval . These blood samples will be collected on Day 1 of 
Cycle 1, every 8weeks (two cycles) for the first sixcycles, once 
every 12weeks (three cycles) thereafter, and at the End of 
Treatment visit.

GAs and markers predictive of response at the laboratories 
selected by [CONTACT_1034] (see Section 6.8).
Blood samples for sparse PK sampling will be collected on Day 1 
and Day 15 of Cycle 1, and Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3 and 4, to 
determine the PopPK parameters of derazantinib. Exploratory 
assessmen ts of metabolites of derazantinib may also be 
investigated from the PK plasma samples (see Section 6.6). 
Asubset of up to 20 patients (PK subgroup) will be asked to 
participate inrich PK blood sampling and PK urine sampling to 
assess the renal excretion of derazantinib (and its metabolites) 
(see Section 6.6). Patients will be asked for a additional consent 
to participate in the blood/urinary PK assessments. 
Exploratory assessments of derazantinib (and possibly 
metabolites) will b e investigated from the PK urine samples.
Statistical methods: Substudy [ADDRESS_1113109] over placebo in ORR in this single- arm 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397], the hypothesis is specified as: 
H0: ORR = 0.10 and Ha: ORR=0.23.
The hypothesis test will be performed at a one-sided 2.5% 
significance level. A 10% response rate is chosen for the null 
hypothesis, which is much higher than the observed ORR of
7~8% in larger historical studies and publications 
(Lamarca 2014) . The 23% response rate for the alternative 
hypothesis is estimated.
Approximately 100 patient s will be enrolled for this two-stage 
group sequential study with futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  An interim analysis 
for futility will be done when 40 patient s who satisfied modified 
intent -to-treat (mITT)criteria had at least one post-baseline tumor 
evaluation. The study will be terminated for futility if four or 
fewer responses are observed among 40 evaluable patient s.*  
If 5 or more objective responses are observed and confirmed 
based on central radiology review prior to enrollment of 
40evaluable patients, the interim analysis may be performed 
based on fewer than 40 patients. 
*The interim analy sis was conducted on 8 January 2019; futility was rejected (informative p -value 0.0275).

of 43. H 0will be rejected if a PFS 3 is observed in 25 or more of 
these 43 patients. The type I error rate is 0.0481, and power 
isapproximately 0.8 when the true PFS3 rate for derazantinib is 
p1= 0.65.
All patients who receive at least one dose of derazantinib capsules

INTRODUCTION
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the most common malignant tumor of the biliary tract, 
affecting approximately 2,500 patients annually in the [LOCATION_002] (US) , with an average 
incidence of 1.67 patients per 100,000 people per year (NORD 2015). Emerging at any 
portion of the biliary tree, it includes tumor subtypes that differ in etiology, 
pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management. Depending on the anatomic 
location, CCA is classified as intrahepatic (iCCA) and 
extrahepatic (eCCA), which are 
further classified into perihilar (pCCA) or distal tumors. iCCA originates from the 
intrahepatic biliary ductal system and accounts for 10-20% of primary hepatic 
malignancies (Blechacz 2008 , NCCN 2016).
There are a number of known potential risk factors for iCCA, including primary sclerosing 
cholangiti s, hepatolithiasis, and liver fluke. However, these factors are not universally 
identified in most patients diagnosed with iCCA. Due to anatomic location, iCCA is usually 
diagnosed at a later stage than eCCA and has very limited treatment options. The iCCA
tumor biology is not well -understood; however, genomic profiling with whole -exome and 
Next -Generation Sequencing (NGS) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has 
identified multiple molecular aberrations that may contribute to its carcinogenesis 
(Chong 2016, Sia2015, Graham 2014 , Borad 2014). Recent whole genome sequencing 
efforts have identified known mutations in genes such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 
(EGFR), kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), v -raf murine sarcoma viral 
oncogene homolog (BRAF ) and tumor protein p53 ( TP53), novel mutations in isocitrate 
dehydrogenase (IDH), BRCA1 -Associated Protein 1 (BAP1) and AT-rich interactive 
domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A ), and novel fusions such as fibroblast growth 
factor receptor 2 ( FGFR2 ) and ROS proto -oncogene 1 (ROS1 ). Inhibitors of these 
pathways are currently in clinical development ( Chong 2016).
Patients diagnosed at an early stage of iCCA are candidates for curative resection or liver 
transplantation. Liver transplantation remains the treatment of choice with the best 
outcome as it intends to cure the disease, but due to the scarcity of organs it is restricted to 
very few patients (ACS 2012 ).Unfortunately, as mentioned above, iCCA is asymptomatic 
in the early stages and by [CONTACT_806470], most patients present with an advanced 
stage of the disease. Advanced disease means most patients (approximately 90%) are not 
eligible for curative surgery, leading to an overall survival of approximately 6 months. 
Non-surgical treatment options for advanced iCCA include locoregional therapy such as 
transart erial chem oembolization (TACE) and chemotherapy with or without radiation 
therapy. The current non-surgical standard of care for unresectable iCCA is combination 
chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (Okusaka 2010, Khan 2012 ).Other systemic 
chemotherapy options include capecitabine, oxaliplatin, fluoropyr imidines, or a 
combination of these agents. It should be noted that none of these drugs have been approved 
for the treatment of iCCA (ACS 2012, Eckel 2011, Kondo 2008, NCCN 2016 ).
Disappointingly, even combined multi -agent chemotherapy does not offer a durable 
response in patients with advanced iCCA, and only 5–10% of patients survive 5 years after 
diagnosis ( Anderson 2004 ).

1.3 Proposed indication and dosage
Derazantinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with FGFR2 fusion positive 
inoperable or advanced iCCA. A Phase 1/2 study (ARQ 087-101) in solid tumors with 
FGFR genetic aberrations (GAs), including iCCA with FGFR2 fusion has completed 
enrol lment , with a total of 119 patients . Derazantinib capsules will be administered by 
[CONTACT_1966] 1hour before, or 2hours after ,a meal at a dose level of 300 mg once daily (QD).
1.4 Nonclinical data
Derazantinib is a multi -kinase inhibitor with potent FGFR1, 2, and 3 activity. Supporting 
in vitro and in vivo studies are summarized below. 
1.4.1 Nonclinical pharmacology overview
[IP_ADDRESS] In vitro studies
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Biochemistry: Inhibition of FGFR kinase activity of derazantinib
FGFR kinase biochemical assays were performed. Derazantinib selectivity against all four 
FGFR isoforms was assayed. Derazantinib inhibited wild-type FGFR1 , FGFR2 , and 
FGFR3 with biochemical inhibitor concentration required for 50% inhibition (IC 50) values 
in the 1.8to 4.5 nM range and FGFR4 with somewhat lower potency (IC 50value of 
34.3 nM) (TR-087-048). Enzymatic kinetic experiments for derazantinib with both FGFR1
and FGFR2 were performed. The inhibition constant (Ki) values were determined to be 
2.7± 0.2 nM and 0.68 ± 0.07 nM, respectively, demonstrating strong affinity of 
derazantinib for FGFR1 and FGFR2 .Michaelis- Menten graphs were generated and four 
inhibition modes (competitive, uncompetitive, noncompetitive, and mixed) were evaluated 
in both Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to 
determine the best fitting model. After the analyses, the competitive model received the 
lowest AIC and BIC and the heaviest weight of AIC and BIC which indicates that 
derazantinib profiled as a competitive inhibitor for both FGFR1 and FGFR2 (data onfile).
The data which indicate that derazantinib is a competitive inhibitor for both FGFR1 and 
FGFR2 arefurther strengthened by [CONTACT_806471] α-factor approached 
infinity in both cases (data onfile).It was therefore concluded that derazantinib is an 
adenosine -triphosphate- (ATP) -competitive inhibitor for both FGFR1 and FGFR2 .
Activatio n of FGFR kinases requires autophosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues 
(Lew 2009, Furdui 2006 ) .Inhibition of this autoactivation reaction by [CONTACT_806472]1 and FGFR2 kinases in an autophosphorylation assay. Derazantinib inhibited the 
autophosphorylation of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in a dose-dependent manner. This observation 
suggests that, in addition to inhibiting the active form of the kinase, derazantinib binds to 
its unphosphorylated or inactive form, thus delaying its activation.
To understand the selectivity of derazantinib across the kinome, the compound was tested 
against a panel of 298 kinases at a concentration of 0.1 µM. Among the 298 kinases 
assayed, approximately 50 (including FGFR1 , FGFR2 , FGFR3 , and FGFR4 ) were 
inhibited by [CONTACT_7809] 50% by [CONTACT_806473] (TR-087- 049).In this subset of kinases, 
examination of IC50values revealed that 19kinases (excluding FGFR s) exhibited 
sensitivities to derazantinib within a 3
-to 10 -fold range of the IC 50value for FGFR2 .

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1113122] of derazantinib on phosphorylation of 
FGFRs was exam ined. Itwas found that derazantinib inhibited the phosphorylation of 
FGFR1 , FGFR2, and FGFR3 with half maximal effective concentration (EC 50) values of 
< 0.123 μM, 0.185 μM, and 0.463 μM, respectively. Derazantinib did not inhibit the 
phosphorylation of FGFR4 in this overexpression system (EC 50> 10 µM). The 
anti-proliferative effect of derazantinib was also examined in a panel of Ba/F3 cell lines 
that had been engineered to be dependent on individually overexpressed tyrosine protein 
kinases for survival, including cell lines dependent on individual FGFR isoforms and 
FGFR fusions. Theconcentration for 50% of maximal inhibition of cell proliferation (GI 50) 
values for Ba/F3- FGFR1 , Ba/F3 -FGFR2 , Ba/F3 -FGFR3, and Ba/F3- FGFR4 ranged 
between 232 nM and 1346 nM, with Ba/F3- FGFR2 the most sensitive cell line to 
derazantinib followed by [CONTACT_806474]/F3- FGFR1 and Ba/F3- FGFR3. FGFR fusions were also 
examined in 
the Ba/F3 system, including TEL-FGFR2 , FGFR2- AAF3, FGFR2 -BICC1, 
FGFR2 -CASP7, FGFR2- CCDC6, FGFR2 -CCDC6, and FGFR3 -BAIAP- 2L1. The GI50
values were between 39.[ADDRESS_1113123] 
sensitive cell line.
Anti- proliferative activity of derazantinib was evaluated on five cholangiocarcinoma
(CCA) cell lines (OZ, NOZ, HuCCT1, HCCC9810, and HuH28) and two adrenocortical 
cell lines (NCI -H295R and SW13). The results showed that in all cell lines cell growth 
was potently inhibited by [CONTACT_806475]50values ranging from 1.[ADDRESS_1113124] that CCA and adrenocortical carcinoma could be therapeutic indications for 
derazantinib (TR-087- 107).
[IP_ADDRESS] In vivo studies
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1113125] of derazantinib was assessed in athymic mice bearing 
Ba/F3- FGFR2, Ba/F3 -INSR, SNU -16, and NCI-H716 cell line-derived tumors. The 
Ba/F3- FGFR2 and Ba/F3 -INSR are transfected models. The SNU-16 cell line harbors 
amplified FGFR2 and contains a PDHX -FGFR2 fusion, while the NCI-H716, also 
amplified for FGFR2 , contains anFGFR2 -COL14A1 fusion. Derazantinib demo nstrated 
potent tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in the Ba/F3 -FGFR2 model, while failing to inhibit 
the growth of the Ba/F3 -INSR model. Meaningful (> 50 TGI vs. control) tumor inhibition 
was observed in both cancer cell line derived xenograft models. In the SNU-16 xenograft 
study, treatment with 75 mg/kg and 50mg/kg achieved 83% (p=0.002) and 69% (p=0.013) 
TGI, respectively. Partial and complete regressions were also observed in both dose groups. 
In the NCI-H716 human cecum model, 50 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg on a Q1Dx14 schedule 
demonstrated significant TGI of 68% (p = 0.0001) and 96% (p = 0.0001), respectively. 
Doses of 150 mg/kg of derazantinib were not well tolerated, resulting in unacceptable 
weight loss and general lethargy.

[IP_ADDRESS] In vivo pharmacodynamics
The in vivopharmacodynamic effect of derazantinib was examined in NCI-H716, SNU-16, 
and MFM -223 tumor -bearing animals. A single dose of derazantinib led to a reduction in 
phospho- FGFR, phospho- FRS2α, phospho- ERK (extracellular signal -regulated kinase), 
phospho- AKT (v-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog), and phospho- S6 in all 
three models tested, while the total FGFR2 protein was unaffected by [CONTACT_806476]. These results indicate that a single dose of derazantinib was sufficient to 
attenuate FGFR signaling in NCI-H716, SNU-16, and MFM -223 xenograft tumors
(TR-087- 040, TR- 087 -079,TR-087-080).
Evidence of derazantinib target engagement can be detected by [CONTACT_806477] n of derazantinib target receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) as well as key 
downstream signaling proteins. In nonclinical xenograft tumor models, inhibition of the 
phosphorylation of FGFR
, FRS2α, and ERK was observed using immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) staining onSNU -16 tumors at the repeated, efficacious dose of 75 mg/kg
(TR-087- 047).By [CONTACT_806478], tyrosine/threonine kinase (MEK) and ERK 
phosphorylation levels were reduced by 68% and 82%, respectively. This dose resulted in 
plasma levels of deraza ntinib of 4.9 ± 2.3 µM.
[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies
The pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of derazantinib were characterized in rats and 
dogs. The oral bioavailability of derazantinib in rats was 37%, and in dogs ranged from 
38to 46% (solution or powder filled capsule), respectively. Overall, in 28-day repeat dose 
studies (in both species), derazantinib had a half -life in plasma which ranged from 4to 
10hours and time to maximum observed concentration (Tmax) which ranged from 5to 
16hours. Dera zantinib was not consistently dose proportional and was found to accumulate 
after repeat dosing in these species.
1.4.2 Nonclinical toxicology studies
Derazantinib was well tolerated over the course of the 13 weeks in Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP) toxicity studies ,with no-observed -adverse-effect level s(NOAELs ) of 
10mg/kg/day for rats and dogs being determined. In the 28-day GLP toxicity studies ,a 
NOAEL dose of 20mg/kg/day (18 days) was determined in dogs ,and a non-severely toxic 
dose (NSTD) of 15 mg/kg/day was determined in rats. Aseverely toxic dose (STD) in rats 
was determined to be 50 mg/kg/day. 
The toxicity profile of orally administered derazantinib in rats and dogs was characterized 
principally by
[CONTACT_806479]/or body weight gain, an effect generally 
correlated to a decrease in food consumption. Trends in reversibility during the recovery 
phase were observed for decreases in body weight and/or body weight gain and decreased 
food consumption in dogs but not in rats. Target organ toxicities based on the results of the 
28-day rat and dog studies were associated with those involving gastrointestinal (rat, dog), 
hematological (rat, dog), liver (rat, dog), bone (rat) and lung (rat) functio n.
In the 28-day rat study, all control, low, and mid dose (0, 5, and 15 mg/kg) animals survived 
to 
the scheduled terminal necropsy. All high dose (50 mg/kg) animals, excluding those 
designated for recovery, were sacrificed and/or necropsied between Days 12 and 14 of the 
dosing phase. Derazantinib -
related clinical observations were limited to animals given

50mg/kg/day, which made necessary the suspension of further dosing and unscheduled 
terminal necropsy. These clinical observations, along with decreases in body weight/body 
weight gain and food consumption, included hunched appearance and swelling of the 
abdomen (noted in one female), thinness, nasal and oral discharge, fecal abnormalities 
(few and non-formed), squinting of the eyes, and pelage/skin abnorm alities. Clinical 
observations associated with thinness, decreases in body weight/body weight gain did not 
resolve following the 2 -
week recovery phase for animals given 50 mg/kg/day.
Additionally, in the 28-day rat study, derazantinib administration was as sociated with 
several effects on clinical pathology test results. The most toxicologically important effects 
included reduced erythropoiesis at >15 mg/kg/day, suspected lymphoid tissue injury at 
50mg/kg/day (females), and liver injury at >15 mg/kg/day. Specifically, reduced 
erythropoiesis was associated with decreased red cell mass and absolute reticulocyte counts 
as well as changes in erythrocytic indices. Decreased lymphocyte counts were observed in 
females given 50mg/kg/day. Increased alanine aminotran sferase (ALT) activity was first 
observed in males given 5 mg/kg/day, followed by [CONTACT_806480] 
(ALP) activity in animals given 15mg/kg/day. At dose levels of 50 mg/kg/day, increased 
ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALP, andgamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT) 
activities were observed. A few less specific derazantinib -related effects, especially 
changes in electrolyte values, were observed during the recovery phase in animals given 
50 mg/kg/day. These changes may have been assoc iated with mild dehydration. No 
macroscopic findings were attributed to derazantinib at the terminal or recovery necropsy.
In animals sacrificed in moribund condition or at the terminal sacrifice, 
derazantinib -related microscopic findings were observed inthe femur and sternum bone 
marrow, alimentary canal (tongue, esophagus, nonglandular stomach, duodenum, ileum, 
and jejunum), spleen, and lung. Most findings were limited to the 50 mg/kg/day dose level.
Exceptions were the lung and spleen, where findings w ere also observed at 15 mg/kg/day.
All derazantinib related microscopic findings observed at the terminal necropsy and in 
animals sacrificed at an unscheduled interval were reversed at the recovery necropsy, 
excluding femur and sternum physeal hypertrophy, increased splenic extramedullary 
hematopoiesis, an d lung vacuolated macrophage infiltrates. Tongue and esophageal ulcers 
observed at 50 mg/kg/day were considered severely toxic.
In the 28-day dog study, administration of derazantinib was tolerated as an oral capsule 
administration in dogs at 3 and 10 mg/k g/day for 29 days and at 20mg/kg/day for 18days; 
however, it was not tolerated at 30 mg/kg/day for 7 days. Animals given 30mg/kg/day had 
vomitus, abnormal feces, body weight loss, and/or markedly reduced food consumption 
during the first week of dosing. One male given 30 mg/kg/day was sacrificed on Day 6 of 
the dosing phase in moribund condition that included clinical observations of vomitus, 
limited use of the hind quarters, ataxia, rigid stance, hypoactivity, dilated and minimally 
responsive pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], excessive salivation, occasional tonic front limbs, and postictal and close 
to seizure threshold. The male had clinical pathology findings consistent 
with 
inflammation/stress, dehydration, and lower serum potassium and chloride that likely 
resulted from vomiting. Potentially adverse, derazantinib -related microscopic findings of 
acute inflammation and ulceration of the esophagus were also noted, and the moribund 
condition of the male is partially attributed to these microscopic findings.

All other animals sur vived to their scheduled sacrifices. Due to adverse findings observed 
at 30 mg/kg/day, dosing was suspended on Day 8 and resumed on Day 12 of the dosing 
phase at 20 mg/kg/day. Abnormal feces observed for most animals given 20 mg/kg/day 
was not considered to be an adverse reaction because it did not impact the health of the 
animals. Animals given 30/20 mg/kg/day had white discolored haircoat of the entire head 
during the dosing and recovery phases; however, this observation was not adverse, and no 
correspond ing microscopic finding was present. No derazantinib -related changes in 
electrocardiogram (ECG )parameters or ophthalmic examinations were observed.
Noderazantinib -related clinical pathology effects were observed at 3 or 10mg/kg/day.
Afew potentially derazantinib -related findings in animals given 30/20 mg/kg/day were 
minor and not considered adverse or toxicologically important. Potentially adverse, 
derazantinib -related microscopic findings of acute inflammation and ulceration of the 
esophagus occurred in one male given 30/20 mg/kg/day. Derazantinib related microscopic 
findings noted during the dosing phase were not present in recovery animals.
In rats and dogs in 28-day/4-week studies, no apparent derazantinib -related effect was 
noted following the dosing phase examination. However, of note, two male rats 
(Animal Nos. B84426 and B84424) given 5 mg/kg/day, one male given 15mg/kg/day 
(Animal No. B84442), and a female (Animal No. B84516) given 15mg/kg/day, were seen 
to have corneal dystrophy on Day 26 of the dosing phase. This finding is not considered 
derazantinib -related due to its low incidence and lack of microscopic correlation.
In 28-day rat studies, minimal to slight physeal hypertrophy was an increase in the 
thickness of the physis mostly due to enlargement and mild disorganization of the zone of 
hypertrophy. Minimal physis hypertrophy persisted in the femur of two recovery males and 
one female given 50 mg/kg/day and in the sternum of one recovery female given 
50mg/kg/day.
Transient effects on clinical chemistry such as increased glucose levels and phosphorous 
levels were observed in rats and/or dogs in shorter duration 7-day repeat dose toxicity 
studies and may be characteristic of FGFR kinase inhibitors (Cuevas -Ramos 2009,
Kharitonenkov 
2011, Brown 2005).
In 13-week toxicity studies, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day doses of derazantinib were well tolerated 
when administered daily via oral gavage to Sprague Dawley rats for 13 weeks. 
Derazantinib -related findings included minimal differences in red blood cell indices; 
minimally lower total white blood cell count, due to lower absolute lymphocyte and 
monocyte counts (females); and minimally lower albumin concentration in animals 
administered 10 mg/kg/day. Findings for animals administered ≥ 3 mg/kg/day included 
minimally higher cholesterol concentration (female) and vacuolated macrophage infiltrates 
in the alveoli of the lung; at the recovery sacrifice, these persisted in the lung of males 
administered 10 mg/kg/day and were partially reversed in females administered 
10mg/kg/day. As none of these observations were considered adverse, the NOAEL is 
10mg/kg/day via oral gavage. At the end of the dosing phase, the NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day 
corresponded to combined male and female average peak concentration (Cmax) and area 
under the concentration -time curve from [ADDRESS_1113126] dose (AUC 0-24) values of 
293ng/mL and 5660 ng·hr/mL, respectively.

In 13-week toxicity studies, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day doses of derazantinib were well tolerated 
when administered daily via capsule to beagle dogs for 13 weeks. Derazantinib -related 
findings included increased lymphocytes in the left and/or right nictitating membranes of 
animals administered ≥ 3 mg/kg/day, which were mostly reversed by [CONTACT_806481], and minimally decreased red cell mass (males and females), absolute 
reticulocyte count (females), and minimally increased AST and ALT activities (females), 
without histological correlates, in anim als administered 10 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL is 10 
mg/kg/day via capsule. At the end of the dosing phase, the NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day 
corresponded to combined male and female C maxand AUC 0-24 values of 444 ng/mL and 
6680 ng·hr/mL, respectively, for males and fem ales combined.
Derazantinib was evaluated for effects on the human ether -a-go-go-related gene (hERG) 
potassium channel using 
human embryonic kidney (HEK)[ADDRESS_1113127] 
on QT was observed in dogs in the cardiovascular study (60 mg/kg) or in the ECG in the 
28-day and 13-week toxicity stud ies(up to 30/20 mg/kg).
Derazan tinib was found to have phototoxic potential in the 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake 
Phototoxicity Test.
In genotoxicity assays, derazantinib was negative for mutagenicity in an AMES study, but 
positive via a predominantly aneugenic mode of action in an in vitro micronucleus assay. 
In a subsequent in vivo micronucleus assay in rats, evaluating both clastogenicity and 
aneugenicity, derazantinib was demonstrated to not be genotoxic.

Solid Tumors with FGFR Genetic 
Alterations, Including Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma 
with FGFR2 Gene Fusion’, was an open- label, two-part Phase 1/2, dose escalation, and 
signal finding study of derazantinib capsules administered to patient s with advanced solid 
tumors. The study was designed to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), 
pharmacodynami cs(PD) , and preliminary efficacy of derazantinib ,and to define a 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).
Further PK analyses were performed in study DZB -CS-102, entitled ‘A Phase 1, two -part, 
open- label, single -oral-dose study to investigate the absolute bioavailability and 
absorption, pharmacokinetics, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of

evaluate the safety, tolerability, PD, and PK ofderazantinib in patient swith advanced solid 
tumors. Treatment was initiated at a dose level of 25 mg every other day (QOD) under 
fasted conditions (1 hour prior to ,or 2 hours after ,the meal).
Dose escalation was done according to the standard 3+3 dose escalation schema. The 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the dose level at which no more than 
onepatient with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed among six patient s. 
Assessment of tumor response was performed according to Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors (RECIST )version 1.1 at baseline and every two cycles (a cycle was 
defined as a 28-day period). Safety assessments included physical examination, vital signs, 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status, and 
hematology/biochemistry. Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAE s) were graded 
according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.
The study was initiated with a derazantinib dose of 25 mg Q OD. Based on the drug safety 
profile and no significant difference in derazantinib PK exposure compared to higher dose 
levels (up to 425 mg QD), including the Food -
effect Cohort PK data, 300 mg QD under 
fasted conditions (1 hour prior to ,or 2 hours after ,the meal) was defined as the RP2D and 
recommended for further evaluation in Part 2 (Expanded Cohort) of the study. 
In total, [ADDRESS_1113130] one dose of derazantinib .
1.5.2 Part 2: Expanded cohort/signal confirmation
Once the RP2D was determined, patient swith advanced solid tumors with FGFR GAs, 
including iCCA with FGFR2 fusions, were enrolled in Part 2. All patient s in Part [ADDRESS_1113131] one dose of derazantinib capsules at the RP2D level of 300mg QD (1hour prior to 
or 2 hours after the meal).
As of 26 October 2018, study ARQ 087-101 had completed a total enrollment of 
119patients, none of whom were ongoing. Enrol lment into the study (Part 1 and Part 2) is 
completed ,and the clinical study r
eport for the entire study is being prepared.
1.5.3 Part 1/Part 2 safety analysis
As of 26 October 2018, enrollment in study ARQ 087-101 had been completed, with a total 
of 119 patients enrolled and evaluated for the safety and tolerability of derazantinib. 
61patients 
were enrolled in Dose Escalation /Food Effect cohorts: three were dosed at 
25mg QOD, six at 25mg QD, six at 50 mg QD, four at 100mg QD, five at 150mg QD, 
five at 200mg QD, seven at 250mg QD, six at 325mg QD, seven at 425mg QD, fiveat 
400mg QD, and an additional seven patients were dosed at 400mg QD under fed 
conditions. The RP2D was defined as 300 mg QD. 
Due to dose-dependent increases in the overall number of drug-related AEs and 
nosignificant difference in derazantinib PK exposure compared to higher dose levels (up 
to 425mg QD), the dose of 300mg QD was defined as the RP2D. There were three events 
of CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_1113132] increased that were defined to be a DLT. All these events resolved

after dose reduc tion (one patient) or treatment discontinuation (two patients). The first 
event was observed at a dose level of 250 mg QD (dose was reduced to 200 mg QD) and 
the two other events were observed at 425 mg QD. No DLTs were reported in the 12 
patients treated at the dose level of 400 mg QD with or without food. However, there was 
an increase in the number of drug-related AEs at high dose levels (400–425 mg QD) 
compared to medium dose levels (250–325 mg QD), thus the dose of 300mg QD was 
defined as RP2D. Additi
onally, at near steady state conditions (Day 22), derazantinib 
concentrations are dose proportional in the dose range of [ADDRESS_1113133] common reasons for 
discontinuing treatment were radiological disease progression (per RECIST) 
69/119 (58.0%) and clinical disease progression 24/119 (20.2%).
At least one drug-related AE was reported in 102 of 119 patient s(85.7%), with most being 
mild or moderate in severity. The five most common derazantinib -related AEs were nausea 
(42.9%), fatigue (41.2%), AST increased (26.1%), vomiting (21.8%), and diarrhea 
(21.0%). Derazantinib -related severe (≥ CTCAE grade 3) AEs were reported in 
23/119 patients (19.3%) . 
Seriou s adverse events (SAEs)were reported in 34/119 (28.6%) patients. Four patients 
(4/119, 3.4%) experienced drug
-related SAEs, including stomatitis, upper gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage, electrocardiogram QT prolongation, and abnormal ECG (each in one patient).
Eleven events (all assessed as unrelated) were reported with fatal outcome ; in six cases , the
events were reported as disease progression, two were reported as general physical health 
deterioration, and three events were reported as cardiomyopathy, cachexia, and pneumonia.
Overall, at [ADDRESS_1113134] derazantinib -related AEs beingof CTCAE Grade 1–2, and provided adequate 
exposure to ensure patient response ,along with predictable expo

reduction is necessary.
1.5.4 Phase 1 PK study (DZB- CS-102) in h ealthy subjects
Following a single oral 300 mg dose of radiolabeled [14C]-derazantinib in the Phase 1 
human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion study DZB -CS-102, 76.5% of 
the dose was recovered in feces and 6.62% in urine ,indicating that fecal excretion was the 
main route of elimination. As renal excretion was the minor route of elimination in healthy 
subjects, it is expected that renal excretion would also be the minor elimination route for 
subjects with renal impairment following oral dosing. The metabolite profiling in feces is 
ongoing.

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Overall study design and plan
This is a multi -center, open label, single arm study evaluating derazantinib in adult 
patient s with inoperable or advanced iCCA and FGFR2 GAs. 
Substudy 1 enrolls patients with FGFR2 fusions.
Substudy 2 enrolls patients with FGFR2 mutations/ amplifications (see Appendix 8
).
Asubset of up to 20 patients ( PK/biomarker subgroups) will be asked to participate in
arich PK blood sampling and PK urine sampling to assess the renal excretion of 
derazantinib (see Sec tion 6.6).
Substudy 1 is considered pi[INVESTIGATOR_806418] 100 patients to determine 
the ORR (see Section 10.7).
Substudy 2 will usea Simon ’stwo-stage design ,with approximately 15 mITT -evaluable 
patients in Stage 1, and an additional 28 mITT- evaluable patients if the study proceeds to 
Stage 2.
Patient eligibility may be assessed in two steps: 1) molecular pre-screening to confirm 
FGFR2 GA status (seeSection 5.2); clinical screening procedures to confirm study 
treatment eligibility (see Section 5.3 ). 
Molecular pre-screening for FGFR2 fusions in Substudy 1may be based on local or central 
testing (see Section 6.8.1 , Table 1). If pre-screening is performed based on a local test, then 
a central confirmati on by [CONTACT_412300]2 break -apart FISH Probe Kit test is required for 
Substudy 1 ( FGFR2 fusions) (see Section 
6.8.1 for further details) .

Molecular pre-screening forFGFR2 mutations/amplifications in Substudy 2should be 
based on NGS testing (for details see Table 2and Appendix 8) performed or commissioned 
by [CONTACT_806467].
Ifan eligible FGFR2 GA status is either known or has been established (seeAppendix 8), 
the patient may undergo clinical screening procedures. If the patient is still receiving prior 
systemic therapy, clinical screening procedures will be delayed until radiographically 
confirmed disease progression or intolerance to 
the ongoing systemic therapy is 
documented. After the study treatment eligibility is confirmed, patients will be enrolled 
and treated with continuous [ADDRESS_1113138] patient s will receive between 1and 8 months of treatment 
with derazantinib capsules . Dose delays and/or reductions will be allowed when 
derazantinib -related toxicity is observed (see Section 7.3Dose Modifications). A related 
toxicity is defined as any toxicity considered related to derazantinib , i.e., definitively, 
probably, or possibly related, or when the relationship is unknown .
During the treatment period, patient s will be evaluated every [ADDRESS_1113139] cycle 
(Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15), and once every cycle thereafter (Day 1 of each cycle).  
Tumor measurements will be done at Screening (within 28days prior to the first dose of 
derazantinib ), once every 8 weeks (twocycles) from the day of the first dose for the first 
sixcycles and once every 12 weeks (three cycles) thereafter. For patient
s with PR or CR, 
the Investigator should perform a confir mation tumor measurement 4 to 5weeks after the 
scan showing PR or CR. For patient s with PD per Investigator assessment, a central 
radiology reviewer confirmation should be received prior to the patient ’s discontinuation 
from the study treatment if progression is seen on the first or second on-treatment scan. 
Patient s who discontinue study drug for a reason other than radiographic disease

STUDY TREATMENTS
Before the start of any study required procedures, including forwarding any tissue sample 
for analysis, the Investigator or designee must obtain a signed written informed consent 
form (ICF) for the study from each prospective study participant or his/her legal 
representative. The Investigator or designee must confirm that the patient has documented 
iCCA.
In Substudy 1, the patient must test positive for FGFR2 fusion by [CONTACT_806495] ,or have documented FGFR2 fusion based on testing conducted 
at alocal or central laboratory approved by[CONTACT_15686]/ IEC, by[CONTACT_806496]. For enrollment of patients in the EU, commercially -used assays must be either 
fully CE
-marked or CE-marked for analytical performance; tests manufactured by 
[CONTACT_806497], and do not have to be CE- marked.
If a patient has documentation from the central laboratory indicating thatthey test negative 
for FGFR2 fusion, that patient may not be enrolled in the study. If FGFR2 fusion is 
identified by a laboratory other than the Sponsor’s central laboratory, then archival and/or 
recent tissue biopsy samples must be collected for further confirmatory testing by[CONTACT_806498]’s central laboratory. Tissue from patients with a negative test based on local 
testing may be submitted to central confirmatory FISH testing. If central FISH testing is 
positive, then the patient may be enrolled in the study.
In Substudy 2, the patient must test positive for FGFR2 mutations /amplifications and 
negative for any concurrent FGFR2 translocation s (see Appendix 8) by [CONTACT_806499] (see Section 6.8.2, Table 2).
Study visits will consist of a Pre-screening visit, if FGFR2 fusion and 
mutation/amplification status is unknown, and/or a Screening visit, during which the 
patien t’s eligibility for the study and baseline disease status will be evaluated. Following 
the first dose of derazantinib capsules , patient s will be evaluated every [ADDRESS_1113159] 
cycle (Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15) ,and once every 4 weeks (Day 1 of each subsequent cycle) 
thereafter. A cycle is defined as 28 days/4 weeks.

Additionally, an End of Treatment visit, 30-day Safety Follow - up v isit, and Survival 
Follow -up(s) will be performed (see Appendix 1for the Schedule of Assessments). 
Following the Screening evaluation, and a determination by [CONTACT_81920]’s Medical Monitor that the patient meets all eligibility criteri a, the patient will be 
enrolled. 
5.1 Informed c onsent
Sample ICFs with core information will be provided to each study site. Prior to study 
initiation at a given study site, each site/Investigator must obtain a written 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_806420]/IEC for the ICF and any other written 
information to be provided to patient s.All ICFs must be compliant with International 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and local 
regulations, and must be approved by [CONTACT_58427]/IEC. The 
written approval of the IRB/IEC, together with the approved patient information/ICF, must 
be maintained in the study master files.
Written informed consent must be obtained from a prospective study participant before any 
study -specific procedures are performed on that individual, including forwarding 
anytissue sample for analysis. Patient s who agree to participate in the study will sign the 
most recently approved ICF and will be provided with a copy of the fully executed 
document. The ICFcan be signed greater than 28 days prior to dosing, and does notneed 
to be re -signed prior to dosing unless specific reasons apply (e.g., a new approved consent 
version has been issued). The original, fully executed ICF will be maintained in the 
respective patient ’s clinical study file.
5.2 Pre-screening visit
After writt en informed consent is obtained, patient s will be pre-screened prior to 
enrollment in the study. The objective of the pre-screening is to assess the patient ’s FGFR2
fusion and mutation/amplification status. 
Pre-screening for FGFR2 fusions in Substudy [ADDRESS_1113160] is required for Substudy 1 (see Section
6.8.1 for further details). 
Pre-screening for FGFR2 gene mutations or amplifications in Substudy 2 will be 
performed based on NGS testing of tissue orplasma samples (see Section 6.8.2 for 
further details).
Patients with known eligible FGFR2 GA status and no requirement for central 
confirmation (Substudy 1only) may undergo clinical screening procedures after after
written informed consent is obtained.

while the patient receives study treatment , at the 30-day Safety Follow - up visit, and 
monthly until [ADDRESS_1113173] administration of study drug. Pregnancy testing 
after the End of Treatment may be performed at the patient ’s local gynecologist to 
reduce the burden related to study visits at the site, but must be communicated to the 
study investigator.
6.6 Pharmacokinetic assessments
Blood samples will be taken to determine the PopPK parameters of derazantinib .
Exploratory assessments of metabolites of derazantinib may also be investigated from the 
same samples.
Time windows are allowed for sample collection as detailed in Appendix 3.
6.6.1 Sparse PK sampling (all patients)
On Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 15, and on Cycle 3 Day 1, PK plasma samples will becollected 
pre
-dose and between 6 and 8 hours after the daily dose of derazantinib .OnDay 1 of Cycles 
2 and 4, PK plasma samples will be collected at pre-dose (seeAppendix 3). The blood 
sampling date and time and the time of derazantinib administration on the day of the PK 
blood draw and on the day prior to the PK blood draw should 
be recorded on the electronic 
case report form (eCRF). 
6.6.2 Rich PK sampling (additional consent required)
In the PK/biomarker subgroup (up to 20 patients) , on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, serial 
PK plasma samples will be collected pre-dose,and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h after the 
daily dose of derazantinib (immediately prior to the next dose) ; the 10 and 12 h time-points 
areoptional . On Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycle 3,PK plasm a samples will be 
collected pre-dose and between 6 and 8 hours after the daily dose of derazantinib. OnDay 1 
of Cycle 4, PK plasm a samples will be collected at pre-dose (seeAppendix 3). Patients will 
be asked for a
n additional consent to participate in the seassessments.
6.6.3 Urinary PK sampling (additional consent required)
Patients who undergo urinary PK sampling should also undergo rich blood PK sampling.
In the PK/biomarker subgroup (up to 20 patients), urine will be collected over a 24 h 
interval onDay 1 of Cycle 2 to determine renal excretion of derazantinib. Exploratory 
assessments of metabolites of derazantinib may also be investigated from the PK urine 
samples (seeAppendix 3).Patients will be asked for a nadditional consent to participate in

6.7 Pharmacodynamic assessments
The goal of PD assessments is to identify additional markers to allow a better prediction of 
response to derazantinib or other cancer treatments, and to evaluate the tumoral and serum -
or plasma- based PD response in patient s treated with derazantinib .
Blood samples for PD assessments will be collected for serum tumor markers (CA19.9, 
CA125, CEA), biomarkers (FGF19, FGF21, FGF23), and ctDNA prior to the first dose on 
Day 1of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of every 8 weeks (every twocycles) for the first sixcycles 
(C3D1, C5D1, C7D1), once every 12 weeks (three cycles) thereafter (C10D1, C13D1, 
etc.), and at the End of Treatment visit. Blood samples for serum tumor markers will 
becollected for all enrolled patient s.Blood samples for biomarkers and ctDNA will be 
collected only from patients enrolled after co mpletion of the interim analysis.
Archival tumor samples will be obtained for all patients to enable additional molecular 
analyses with regard to the identified GAs and markers predictive of response at the 
laboratories selected by [CONTACT_1034] (see Section 6.8). 
The planned analyses include, but are not limited to, biomarkers identifying additional 
markers to allow a better prediction of response to dera
zantinib or other cancer treatments,
biomarkers representing further MAPK (RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK), PI3K/AKT, and 
JAK/STAT pathways, biomarkers indicating PI3K, PTEN, EGFR, MET and ERB3 
signaling, and biomarkers demonstrating phosphorylation status of phospho -S6,
phosphor -STAT, phospho- AKT, phospho- MEK, phospho- ERK, and RNA -expression of 
proteins activated by [CONTACT_806504] -pathway, such as SPRY2 and DUSP6.
All collected samples will be evaluated in batches either during or after the end of the study.
All testing will be performed at a laboratory designated by [CONTACT_1034]. Samples remaining 
from PD analyses may be used to supplement diagnostic analysis batches
,and vice versa.

(Substudy 1) , ortest positive for FGFR2 mutation /amplification (Substudy 2) .
6.8.1 FISH testing
FISH testing will be the primary method to confirm FGFR2 fusions in Substudy 1.
If the FGFR2 fusion is identified by a laboratory other than the Sponsor’s central 
laboratory, then archival and/or recent tissue biopsy samples or a tissue block suitable for 
biomarker analysis must be available for confirmatory testing using the break-a part FISH 
test by [CONTACT_1034]’s central laboratory (ARUP laboratories; Salt Lake City, [LOCATION_003]). 
These samples should be sent to the central laboratory as early as possible, and no later 
than [ADDRESS_1113175] dose of derazantinib.

For Substudy 2, available liquid biopsy findings from NGS testing from contemp orary 
liquid biopsies may be used to determine the patient’s FGFR2 molecular stat us (Table 2); 
however, a tumor block or slides prepared thereof should be submitted for correlative
tissue -based NGS testing at a laboratory identified by [CONTACT_1034]. De novo NGS testing 
should be performe d on tumor tissue samples from potentially eligible patients with iCCA 
for whom no local molecular pre-screening results are available (Table 2).If possible, NGS 
testing should be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary liver 
cancer specimens; alternatively ,tissue samples of different organ origin may be used if in 
accord ance with the assay ’s specifi cations. Archived tissue specimens may be submitted 
(for minimum tissue requirements, see Table 2) if they meet the requirements outlined in 
the Laboratory Manual. Detailed instructions for collection, shipment, and testing of blood 
and tissue samples for PK and PDassessments will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.
NOTE: Samples for PK, and PDassessments will be labeled by [CONTACT_806511] s’ study ID; patient s’ identity will not be made known to 
employees from the Sponsor, additional collaborators, or other 
investigators. Samples will 
only be used for the purposes of the protocol and will only be used by [CONTACT_1034]’s
personnel or by [CONTACT_806512]. Samples will be kept until all protocol- related analyses 
are completed, for a p eriod not exceeding [ADDRESS_1113180] dose of study treatment on C1D1, then this may be 
used for Screening purposes; in such situations it is not necessary to repeat tests if the 
assessments are of sufficient diagnostic quality. 
Tumor assessments (CTor MRI scan) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be done once 
every 8 weeks (every twocycles) from the day of the first dose for the first sixcycles 
(C3D1, C5D1, 
C7D1) , and once every 12weeks (every three cycles) thereafter (C10D1, 
C13D1, etc.). The End of Treatment scan will be done if the previous scan was not done 
within four weeks (28 days) prior to the End of Treatment visit or if the previous scan did 
not show radiographic disease progression. The same imaging modality (CT or MRI) must 
be used throughout the study unless the patient develops a contraindication to the modality 
used for the Screening scan.
A bone scan (BS) , oralternatively a whole-body MRI (WBMRI) ,should be performed at 
Screening only in patients with new symptoms (e.g., new persistently -elevated ALP) to 
assess bone metastasis; screening of asymptomatic patients for clinically unapparent bone 
metastases is not supported by [CONTACT_806513] (Chen 2020 , Vogel 2018,

was obtained within [ADDRESS_1113182] version 1.1 (see Appendix 6).
6.10 Patient -
reported outcome s
HRQOL and symptom response will be measured using the EORTC QLQ- C30
QLQ -BIL21 , the EQ-5D, and the G-SET/HTI .Guidelines for completion of these 
instruments are pro vided in Appendix 7.
The EORTC QLQ -C30 measures five 
functional dimensions (physical, role, emotional, 
cognitive, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting) , 
sixsingle symptom items (dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, 
and financial impact), and global health and quality -of-life.
It will be administered in conjunction with a disease -specific quality of life questionnaire 
QLQ -BIL21 , which is the only scale focusing specifically on the HRQoL of patients with 
cholangiocarcinoma. The EORTC QLQ- BIL21 comprises five multi -item measures of 
cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer-associated s ymptom s (eating symptoms, 
jaundice, tiredness, pain symptoms, anxiety), and three single items on treatment side 
effects, difficulties with drainage bags/tubes, and concerns regarding weight loss 
(Kaupp- Roberts 2016 ).
The EQ-5Dis a standardized instrument measuring health outcomes, with five health state 
dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. 
The EQ-5D also includes a graded vertical visual analog scale (VAS) on which the patients 
rate their general state of health at the time of the assessment.

The G-SET/HTI is a single item, and will be used as an external anchor to determine the 
minimal important difference of the EQ-5D VAS, EORTC QLQ -C30, and QLQ -BIL21 
scales. It will be administered twice during the study, consistent with the protocol by [CONTACT_806514] ( Musoro 2018 ) for evaluating the minimal important 
differ ence. The G-SET/HTI will be provided after 8weeks (at Cycle 3 Day 1) and 16weeks 
(at Cycle 5 Day 1). The G-SET/HTI is a patient -rated change in health between two time 
periods using a five-point ordinal scale (1=much better now than 8weeks 
ago; 2=somewhat better now than 8weeks ago; 3=about the same as 8weeks ago; 
4=somewhat worse now than 8weeks ago; 5=much worse now than 8weeks ago) (adapted 
from Ware 2002 , Lloyd 2014). 
The QLQ -C30,QLQ -BIL21 , and EQ-
5Dquestionnaires will be provided to the patient s to 
complete before the first dose on Day [ADDRESS_1113183] cycle, every 8 weeks (two cycles) for 
the first sixcycles (C3D1, C5D1, C7D1), once every 12 weeks (three cycles) thereafter 
(C10D1, C13D1, etc.), at the End of Treatment visit, and at the 30-day Safety Follow -up 
visit. The G -SET/HTI will be provided after 8weeks (at Cycle 3 Day 1) and 16 weeks (at 
Cycle 5 Day 1)

derazantinib capsules weredispensed, the date and quantity dispensed, and balance 
remaining, if from individual patient drug units, as well as the lot number, dose, and the 
initials of the dispenser. Drug accountability is performed to the capsule level.
To avoid unnecessary waste of derazantinib capsules , in cases where treatment was 
interrupted and/or dose was reduced, the patient can continue dosing from the previously 
dispensed bottle until the next drug dispensing visit where re -supply is needed to maintain 
the protocol dosing regimen.
At the end of the study or as directed, all study drug, including unused, partially used, or 
empty containers, will be returned to the designee as instructed by [CONTACT_1034].
Derazantinib capsules will be returned only after the study monitor has completed a final 
inventory to verify the quantity to be returned. The return of derazantinib capsules must be 
documented and the documentation must be included in the shipment. Unused drug

7.1.4 Deraz antinibadministration
Derazantinib capsules will be administered once a day, by [CONTACT_1966]. All patient s will dose at 
300mg once daily (QD) unless a dose reduction is required. Derazantinib capsules must 
be administered 1hour before, or at least 2hours after,
ameal , except in the rich PK patient 
subset, who will be fasted on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (first dose), when derazantinib will be 
administered after at least [ADDRESS_1113188] CTCAE Grade ≥2, a light 
meal before subsequent derazantinib administration is allowed, to minimize the severity of 
the event.
For administrative reasons, the treatment period is defined by 4- week cycles (28 days).
For an individual patient , treatment will continue until death, disease progression (clinical 
or radiological), 
unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met.It 
isexpected that most patients will receive deraz antinib capsules for [ADDRESS_1113189] dose 
of derazant inib, the patient may be re -challenged at the Investigator’s discretion.
Only 
if a derazantinib dose is vomited within 2 hours of administration ,this should be 
considered as a missed dose and reported in eCRF.
7.3 Dose mod ifications for drug -related toxicities
7.3.1 General recommendations
In general, once the dose of derazantinib has been modified for a patient , all subsequent 
cycles should be administered to that patient at the modified dose. The modified dose will 
be considered the maxi mum dose for all subsequent cycles for that patient .
When a drug-related toxicity is observed, dose delays and/or reductions in derazantinib
administration are allowed. A drug- related toxicity is defined as any toxicity considered 
definitely , probably, orpossibly related to derazantinib , or when the relationship is

unknown. If dose reduction is indicated, a patient should be assigned to the lower dose. 
Dose re-escalation is not permitted. In the event of a dose modification, the dose change(s) 
must be captured in the EDC system. If questions or considerations regarding dose 
modification arise or a specific dose modification is needed, the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor or designee should be consulted.
In the event of nausea or vomiting (both assessed as potenti al risks for derazantinib), which 
is assessed as at least CTCAE Grade ≥ 2, a light meal before subsequent derazantinib 
administration is allowed, to minimize the severity of the event; immediate dose

7.3.2 Hyperphosphatemia
Because hyperphosphatemia is not defined by [CONTACT_3989] v. 4.03, for the purpose of this 
protocol hyperphosphatemia is defined as:
Grade 1: > ULN to < 7.0 mg/dL (< 2.26 mmol/L)
Grade 2: Non-invasive intervention required (e.g., withhold drug or modify dose) 
orbetween 7. 0 – 9.0 mg/dL(2.26 – 2.90mmol/L)
Grade 3: Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life threatening ,
or > 9.0 – 10.0 mg/dL (˃ 2.90 – 3.23 mmol/L)
Grade 4: Life-

A complete ophthalmological examination (see Section 6.3) should be performed by [CONTACT_806519], for the first four cycles (i.e., Day 1 of Cycles 2–5) , 
and at the End of Treatment visit. Further complete ophthalmological examinations only 
need to be performed if clinically indicated. Table 6provides specific guidance for the 
management of dose delays/reductions in the case of retinal adverse events possibly related 
to derazantinib.

7.3.4 Management of QTc prolongation or other significant ECG abnormalities
If significant QTc prolongation and/or significant ventricular arrythmia is observed, i.e., a 
prolonged QTc interval ≥ [ADDRESS_1113192] two separate ECGs (consistent with a 
CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 event) , derazantinib mustbe withheld, and the patient must be 
monitored by [CONTACT_806520] (triplicate) 12-lead ECG obtained until the QTc 
has returned to ≤ 470 msec. The clinical context and possible factors contributing to QTc 
prolongations such as electrolyte abnormalities (potassium, calcium or magnesium), 
concomitant medications, or other clinical factors such as cardiac ischemia must be 
carefully assessed, and anyfindings documented in the eCRF. The decision to continue 
treatment with derazant inib should be reviewed and supported by a c ardiologist.
Once QTc prolongation has resolved, and if a decision was made to continue treatment 
with derazantinib, patients may continue treatment at a lower dose with anECG monitoring
schedule defined by [CONTACT_72324] . 
Patients who experience a QTc interval ≥ [ADDRESS_1113193] two separate ECGs after 
dose reduction will be discontinued from study.
All significant QTc prolongations or other relevant ECG abnormalities, will also be 
evaluated centrally.
7.4 Treatment compliance
All doses given during the patient ’s visits with the Investigator will be administered under 
the supervision of clinical study personnel. The patient s will be instructed to return all 
unused study drug at the next visit. Compliance to the study drug regimen will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_618637].
During the treatment period, if compliance is not between 80% and 120%, inclusive, the 
patient will be counseled about the importance of adherence to the mandated regimen.
Ifthe patient continues to be noncompliant in terms of dosing, the patient may have to be 
discontinued from the study treatment.
Administration of derazantinib capsules will be recorded in the Drug Accountability Log 
and eCRF. Patient s must return empty bottles and remaining capsules. Returned capsules 
must be recorded in the Drug Accountability Log which is supplied to the site.
At each visit after the study treatment is initiated, the Investigator or designee must record 
the date, interval between visits, quantity and strengths, and any dose changes/interruptions 
of study drug dispensed/administered. To avoid unnecessary waste of derazantinib
capsules, in cases where treatment was interrupted and/or dose was reduced, the patient
can continue dosing from the previousl y dispensed bottle until the next drug dispensing 
visit where re -supply is needed to maintain the protocol dosing regimen.% compliance =# of capsules dispensed –# of capsules returned

7.7.2 Prohibited treatment /treatment to be avoided or used with caution
The following treatments are not allowed during the study:
Any concurrent anti-cancer therapy including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal, 
targeted therapy, or immunotherapy
–Palliative radiotherapy for non- hepatic local pain- control may be allowed, 
provided the patient does not meet criteria of progressive disease and treated 
lesions will not be included in the target/non- target lesion assessment 
Other investigational agents
Immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including systemic corticosteroids (except up to 
a 
25mg/day prednisone -equivalent dose or when used intermittently in an antiemetic 
regimen, for CNS metastases managem ent or as premedication for imaging studies) 
The following treatments should be avoided , if possible, or used with caution during the 
study:
Derazantinib may inhibit CYP2C8, CYP1A2 ,or CYP2D6 metabolism, hence co-
administration of derazantinib with drugs known to be substrates of CYP2C8, 
CYP1A2 ,or CYP2D6 should be avoided or used with caution (see Appendix 4)
Derazantinib may be a substrate and inhibitor of human P
-glycoprotein (P-gp), 
therefore co-administration of derazantinib with drugs known to be P-gp substrates with 
narrow therapeutic index should be avoided or used with caution (see Appendix 5)
Drugs with known liver toxicity, e.g., clotrimazole, should be avoided or used with 
caution; if such drugs 
need to be administered, LFT should be done every 4–5 days 
during the drugs’ co -administration
Drugs 
with the potential to prolong QT interval (see Appendix 9)

safety profile in nonclinical studies. In clinical trials in iCCA (Mazzaferro 2018, 
Papadopoulos 2017, Droz dit Busset 2020 ),deraza ntinib has been shown to be active with 
a manageable safety profile. It is therefore expected that patients may derive a benefit from 
derazantinib monotherapy in the current study .
Hyperphosphatemia, fatigue, ocular disorders, gastrointestinal disorders (constipation, 
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, and dry mouth), transaminase elevation, 
hypertension, creatinine increased / renal disorders, hyponatremia, nail toxicit iesand 
alopecia are the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with FGFR 
inhibitor treatments (Chae 2017, Katoh 2019, Balversa ®USPI ,Pemazyre ®USPI ), and are 
considered to be FGFR inhibitor class effects. Of these, hyperphosphatemia, fatigue, ocular 
disorders, blood creatinine increased/renal disorders, hyponatremia, and nail toxi cities are 
assessed as important potential risks for derazantinib, and increased transaminases is 
assessed as an important identified risk for derazantinib. The following events are assessed 
as potential risks for derazantinib: QT prolongation, gastrointes tinal disorders, 
hypertension, and alopecia. Gastrointestinal disorders, and hypertension can be monitored

(i.e., mean effect > 20 ms) effect of derazantinib on QTcF. There have been no serious 
events / arrhythmias reported as being consequent to QT prolongation, and the risk is 
mostly preventable with the implemented routine risk minimization measures. As the 
safety data are accumulating and remain subject to final evaluation for ongoing studies

8.1.7 Further adverse event and serious adverse event definitions
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs 
and symptoms should be identified. However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom 
is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it 
should be recorded as a separate AE.
Laboratory data are to be collected as stipulated in Section 6.5. Clinical syndromes 
associated 
with laboratory abnormalities are to be recorded as appropriate (e.g., diabetes 
mellitus instead of hyperglycemia).

Adverse events, that occur following the execution of the ICF but prior to dosing must be 
recorded in the medical history page of the eCRF; if serious, these must be reported as 
SAEs as described in Section 8.4. Adverse events ,including SAEs ,that occur after patient s

Grade 4: Life- threatening or disabling AE
Grade 5: Death
For AEs that can be described by [CONTACT_806521], the NCI CTCAE Grade 4 
(life- threatening or disabling AE) is assessed based on unique clinical descriptions of 
severity for each AE, and these criteria may be different from those used for the assessment 
of AE seriousness. An AE assessed as Grade 4 based on the NCI CTCAE grades may or 
may not be assessed as serious based on the serio usness criteria.
8.7 Assessment of caus ality
The relationship between an AE and derazantinib will be determined by [CONTACT_806522]/her clinical judgment and following definitions:

of concomitant medications
All AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
coding system and displayed in tables and data listings using system organ class (SOC) 
and preferred term (PT). Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events that are 
considered treatment -emergent, where treatment -emerge nt is defined per protocol as any 
AE or SAE with onset beginning on the day of administration of the first dose of study 
drug, throughout the treatment period until 30days after cessation of study treatment 
(oruntil the start of alternate anticancer therapy, whichever occurs earlier), or any event 
that was present at baseline but worsened in intensity or was subsequently considered drug-
related by [CONTACT_119573].
The number and percentage of patients with any TEAE, with any TEAE assessed by [CONTACT_479885] (definite, probable, or possible relationship to 
derazantinib, or the relationship is unknown ), and with any SAE will be summarized for 
all enrolled patient s. In these tabulations, each patient will contribute only once to each of 
the incidence rates in the descriptive analysis, regardless of the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].

[CONTACT_105]-compartmental analysis. The following parameter s will be determined: Cmax, tmax, 
AUC 0-24, AUC last. Of these patients, those that provide 24 h interval urine samples on Cycle 
2 will be included for the determination of urinary excretion parameters: Ae, Ae%, CLR.
Plasma concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized with descriptive statistics, 
including mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, geometric mean, 
coefficient of variation of geometric mean, minimum and maximum. 
In all other patients who receive at least onedose of study drug and have at least onePK 
sample , plasma concentrations will be summarized separately with descriptive statistics , 
including mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, geometric mean, 
coeff icient of variation of geometric mean, minimum and maximum.
A PopPK analysis will be performed with the possibility of pooling PK data from other 
clinical studies. A separate PopPK analysis report will be provided.
10.[ADDRESS_1113211]-baseline measurement, and change from 
baseline will be performed on serum tumor markers and biomarkers (e.g., CA19.9, CEA, 
CA125, FGF19, FGF21, FGF23) utilizing standard blood chemistry methodologies and 
enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)- based assays. 
To explore the association of blood concentration with clinical outcome, the above 
descriptive statistics of tumor markers and biomarkers will also be presented separately for 
each response category (CR, PR, and stable disease [SD]combined vs. PD). Logistic 
regression will also be utilized if appropriate.
10.6 Efficacy analyses
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized on the data from patients. All analyses will 
include summary statistics, including number of patients (n) and percentage (%) for 
categorical variables and number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum for continuous variables. Two-sided exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs)

ORR=0.23 at the interim and final analyses as specified:
The decision rules are specified as: 
If the interim one
-sided p-value, p1 > 0.5 (i.e., the observed ORR is less than 10%), the 
trial will stop due to futility; otherwise, the trial will continue to the secon d stage. At 
the final stage, if the p-value is ≤ to 2.5% (one-sided), or equivalently the lower limit 
of the CI is ≥ 10%, the null hypothesis will be rejected.
In the final analysis, the ITT population will be the primary analysis population.
Substudy 2
The primary efficacy endpoint will be progression
-free survival at 3 months (PFS 3) based 
on survival status or central radiology review RECIST 1.1. For Substudy 2, aSimon ’stwo-
stage design will be used,with approximately 15 patients in Stage 1,and an additional 
28patients if the study proceeds to Stage 2. H0 will be rejected if a PFS 3 isobserved in 
25 or more of these 43 patients. The type I error rate is 0.0481, and power is approximately 
0.8 when the true PFS 3 rate for derazantinib is p1 = 0.65.
The mITT population will be the primary analysis population.
10.6.2 Secondary efficacy parameters
Duration of response, PFS and OS will be presented through use of summ ary statistics 
using KM methods, to include 25th, 50th(median), and 75thpercentiles and assoc iated 
2-sided 95% CIs for the median, number of events and number of censored observations. 
PFS will be defined by [CONTACT_393] v1.1, based on the date of PD that will be used to determine 
duration. ORR is defined as the achievement of confirmed CR or PR using R ECIST v1.1, 
as assessed by [CONTACT_806523].
Changes in HRQOL and symptom response will be analyzed based on the EORTC 
QLQ -
C30, QLQ- BIL21, and the EQ-5D VAS ,prim arily using descriptive statistics. 
10.6.3 Exploratory efficacy analyses
Tumor markers (CA19.9, CA125, CEA) and biomarkers (FGF19, FGF21, FGF23) will be 
analyzed using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_806524].
Other analyses such as correlation between tumor and biomarkers, toxicity, responses, 
outcomes with derazantinib versus prior chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and PK param eters will be 
conducted and will be further described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

I error rate is 0.0481, and power is approximately 0.8 when the true PFS3 rate for 
derazantinib is p 1= 0.65.
If the required number of patients alive and without disease progression is reached before 
full enrollment to Stage 1, the decision to transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2 may be taken 
before Stage 1 is fully enrolled. 
If the required number of patients alive and without disease progression is not reached at 
the time of full enrollment to Stage 1, further enrollment will be suspended to allow for all 
patient s to be evaluated for PFS 3.
10.8 Data Monitoring Committee
The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to ensure the safety of study 
patient s and the validity of study results. The DMC composition and operation will be 
described in the DMC charter. The DMC may recommend study termination or 
continuation based on periodic review of safety and/or efficacy data in this study.

Confidential –Proprietary information of Basilea Pharmaceutica International Ltd. Page 98of [ADDRESS_1113237] guidelines, 
version 1.1. Some of these defi nitions and criteria are highlighted below.
Measurability of tumor baseline
CT with intravenous (IV) contrast and MRI are the best currently available and 
reproducible methods to measure target lesions selected for response assessment.
Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_1113238] should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous 
reconstruction algorithm.
Standard imaging studies should be performed according to the imaging manual provided 
by [CONTACT_806537].
Definitions
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
Measurable 
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
[ADDRESS_1113239] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).
10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable).
[ADDRESS_1113240] X -ray.
Measurable malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_1113241] scan (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. See also notes below on ‘Baseline documentation 
of target and non- target lesions’ for information on lymph node measurement.
Non-measurable
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions 
considered truly non
-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin (nevi) or 
lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_201782].

Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular 
comment:
Bone lesions
Bone scan, PET scan, or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions.
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that 
can be evaluated by [CONTACT_193620].
Blastic bone lesions are non- measurable.
Cystic lesions
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simpl e cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
‘Cystic lesions’ 
thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if noncystic lesions are 
present in the same patient , these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
Lesions with prior local treatment
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-
regional therapy, are not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion. 
Specifications by [CONTACT_806538] l esions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. 
All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and 
NEVER more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
Method of a ssessment
The same method of assessment andthe same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based evaluation 
should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed 
cannot be imaged bu t are assessable by [CONTACT_461].
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and ≥ 10 mm diam eter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin (nevi) nodules). For the case of 
skin (nevi) lesions, documentati on by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size 
of the lesion is suggested. As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_115199], imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also 
be reviewed at the end of the study.

17 November 2020
Confidential –Proprietary information of Basilea Pharmaceutica International Ltd. Page 100of [ADDRESS_1113242] X-ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X- ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions. However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1113243] a 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable 
lesion should be twice 
the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans). 
Tumor response evaluation
Assessment of overall tumor burden and me asurable disease
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. In this study, 
only patient s with measurable disease at baseline should be included in the study. 
Baseline documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non- target’ lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 
five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline 
(this means in instances where patient s have only one or two organ sites involved, a maximu m 
of two and four lesions respectively will be recorded). 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), 
be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves 
to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion 
which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. As noted above, pathological nodes which 
are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a 
short axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_1113244] in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for 
MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal). The smaller of these measures 
is the short axis. For example, an abdominal no de which is reported as being 20 mm ×30 mm 
has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 
mm should be recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with 
short axis ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a 
short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesio ns will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of the diameters. If lymph nodes 
are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.

The baseline sum of the diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified 
as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurement s are not required 
and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’ (more details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target 
lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g., ‘multiple 
enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’). 
Response c
riteria
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response 
for target lesions.
Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
Partial Response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more 
new lesions is also considered progression).
Stable Disease: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diam eters while on study. In this study, 
the minimum duration for SD is defined as 8 weeks (± 2 days).
Special notes on the assessment of target lesions
Lymph nodes. Lymph node s identified as target lesions should always have the actual short 
axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline 
examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph 
nodes are includ ed as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete 
response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 
mm. For PR, SD, and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in 
the sum of target lesions.
Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’ . While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-
nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each Response 
Criteria subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). However, sometimes 
lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT 
scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report 
them as being ‘too small to measure’. When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded 
on the case report form. If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_130990], the measurement should 
be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be 
present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned 
Derazantinib
Clinical Study Protocol
DZB -CS-301Protocol Version 9.0
17 November 2020

(Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a 
definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by f at such as in the 
retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too 
small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well). 
This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_1113245] slice thickness (but should not be changed 
with varying CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-
reproducible, therefore providing this default value will prevent false responses or progressions 
based upon measurement error. Toreiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an 
actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment. When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest 
diameters of the fragmented 
portion s should be added together to calculate the target lesion 
sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid 
in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have 
truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this 
instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.
Evaluation of non-target lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for 
the group of non-target lesions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, 
they need not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points 
specified in the protocol. 
Complete Response: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and norm alization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non
-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non- PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor mar ker level above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease: Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing non-
target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression).
Special notes on the assessment of progre
ssion of non- target disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires additional explanation as follows:
When the patient also has measurable disease. In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal 
progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial 
worsening in non-target disease such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, 
the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy (see 
further details below). A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is 
usually not sufficient to quality for unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall 
progression solely on the basis of change in non
-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target 
disease will therefore be extremely rare.

Missing assessments and inevaluable designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not 
evaluable (NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements is made at an 
assessment, usually the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing 
argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not 
change the assigned time point response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of 
PD. For example, if a patient had a baseline sum of [ADDRESS_1113246] overall response: all time points
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the patient areknown.
Best respons e determination in trials where confirmation of complete or partial response IS 
NOT required: Best response in these trials is defined as the best response across all time points 
(for example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessme nt, and PD on 
last assessment has a best overall response of PR). When SD is believed to be the best response, 
it must also meet the protocol specified minimum time from baseline of [ADDRESS_1113247] time point response, the patient ’s best 
response depends on the subsequent assessments. For example, a patient who has SD at the 
first assessment, PD at second the assessment, and does not meet the minimum duration for 
SD, the patient will have a best response of PD. The same patient lost to follow -up after the 
first SD assessment would be considered inevaluable.
Special notes on response assessment
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ 
size (< 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This measurement 
should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression 
should it be based on increase in the size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means that patient s 
with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the eCRF.
For patient s with PR or CR, the Investigator should make every attempt to perform the 
confirmation scan [ADDRESS_1113248]- treatment scan.
Patient s with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
‘symptomatic deterioration’. Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective response: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003]. The objective response status of 
such patient s is to be determined by [CONTACT_12157]- target disease.
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 
assessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.

Frequency of tumor re-evaluation
In this study, tumor measurement will be conducted at baseline, and once every 8 weeks (every 
twocycles) from the day of the first dose for the first 6 months and once every 12weeks (every 
three cycles) thereafter while the patient is on treatment or as clinically indicated until 
progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, or death. Tumor measurement will also be 
performed during the End ofTreatment visit if it is not done within [ADDRESS_1113249] be performed within three weeks (21days) of the first dose 
of treatment. 
All efforts must be made to ensure consistency between the baseline measurements and all 
subsequent measurements in reference to utilization of scanning methods, equipment, 
technique (including slice thickness and field of view), and the radiographic interpreter.
The radiological evaluation must include CT or MRI scanning of the chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis. Any additional suspected sites of disease should also be imaged. All evaluations must
meet the standard of care for imaging of lesions in the respective organ(s). 
All target and non -target sites are evaluated at each time point of tumor assessment. 
Conf irmatory measurement/duration of response
Confirmation
Confirmation of PR and CR is required 4–[ADDRESS_1113250] met 
for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the firstdate that recurrent or progressive disease 
is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded on study).
The duration of overall comp lete response is measured from the time measurement criteria that 
are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.
Duration of stable disease
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are 
met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is 
the reference for calculation of PD). In this study, the minimum duration for SD is defined as 
8 weeks (± 3 days).

Appendix 7Patient -reported outcomes guidelines
These guidelines assume that an appropriate person has been designated to facilitate the self-
administration of the questionnaire.
When and how should the questionnaire be administered?
The QLQ -C30,QLQ -BIL21, EQ -5D, and the G -SET/HTI should be completed by [CONTACT_806539]. Theyshould be administered 
at the start of the visit, before the patient sees the physician, and on day C1D1 prior to the first 
dose of study medication , so that any interaction between the patient and physician will not 
influence the patient ’s responses to the questionnaire. The questionnaires should also be 
administered before the patient is asked about adve rse experiences and concurrent illnesses, 
again so that any discussions of health problems do not influence the patient ’s responses. The 
QLQ -C30,QLQ -BIL21 , and EQ-5Dareto be administered on Day [ADDRESS_1113251] cycle, every 
8 weeks (twocycles) for the first sixcycles, once every 12weeks (three cycles) thereafter, and 
at the End of Treatment visit, and at the 30-day Safety Follow - up visit. The G-SET/HTI will 
be administered after 8 weeks (at Cycle 3 Day 1) and 16 weeks (at Cycle 5 Day 1).
A quiet place should be provided for the patient to complete the questionnaire. It is important 
that the patient completes the questionnaire alone, without any advice from family members 
or friends who may accompany them. On average, it takes less than [ADDRESS_1113252] basic fluency in the language of their country in order to complete the QLQ -
C30,QLQ -BIL21, and EQ-5D. If a patient is not able to speak/read the language of his/her 
country, check if the patie nthas basic fluency in any of the languages in which the 
questionnaire is currently available and which has been approved by [CONTACT_116103]/IEC. 
How should the questionnaire be introduced?
A sample script for introducing the questionnaire is given below.
‘Your doctor would like to better understand how you feel, how well you are able to do your 
usual activities, and how you rate your health. To help us better understand these things about 
you, please complete thequestionnaire sabout your health. The quest ionnaires areeasy to fill 
out. The instructions are at the beginning of each questionnaire . You should read each question 
and then circle the appropriate number that matches your answer. Remember that this is not a 
test and there are no right or wrong answers. Choose the answer that best describes the way 
you feel. I will quickly review the questionnaire when you are finished to make sure that all of 
the questions have been answered. You should answer these questions by [CONTACT_202699]. Your 
spouse or other famil y members should not help you when you answer the questionnaire. I will 
be nearby [CONTACT_240770]. Please return the questionnaire sto me 
when you have finished.’
What to do if the patient asks for clarification?
Some patients may ask the meaning of specific questions. If this happens, the staff member 
can assist the patient by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-reading the question for them verbatim. If the patient asks what 
something means, do not try to explain what the question means, but tactfully suggest tha t the 
patient use his/her own interpretation of the question. All patient s should answer the questions 
based on what they think the questions mean, or the study results may be biased.

If the questionnaire sarenot complete, point out to the patient that some of the questions were 
not answered. If the patient does not quickly volunteer to answer these items, ask him/her 
whether she had any difficulty completing the questionnaire. If the patient says that he/she had 
trouble understanding a question, ask him/her why he/she had difficulty with that item. Re-
read the question for him/her verbatim, but do not attempt to explain or reword the question, 
as explained before. If the patient is still unable to answer the question, accept the questionnaire 
as is.
Some patient s may be confused by [CONTACT_240771]. They may want to respond with 
‘Idon’t know’ or some other response choice that is not available. If this happens, try to help 
the patient choose one of the response categories by [CONTACT_240772]: ‘I know that it may 
be difficult for you to choose an answer, but which of these answers do you think comes closest 
to the way that you are thinking or feeling?’ If the patient still cannot select an answer, accept 
the questionnaire as is.
Occasionally, patient s may not report having difficulty with a question or the response choices, 
but still may hesitate or refuse to answer an item or items. If this happens, accept the 
questionnaire as is.
If a patient asks for interpretation of his/her responses or asks for his/her scores on the 
questionnaire, tell him/her that you are not trained to score or interpret the questionnaire.
Emphasize that their answers will be kept confidential.

8/28/19  1.0 Background  
 
CD36 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, heart and adipose tissue of mice 1 both o n tissue cells and in 
the endothelium of blood vessels .2, 3 Endothelial cells (EC) of large arteries have low CD36 while 
expression is high in EC from medium arteries, arterioles and capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037]. RNAseq data in huma ns show 
that aorta CD36 expression is 1/[ADDRESS_30456] in heart, muscle and adipose tissues compared to other tissues .2, 4 CD36 has a regulatory rol e in 
Fatty acids ( FA) uptake and oxidation by [CONTACT_31114] 5-7 and its expression in EC could contribute 
to this role. Our hypothesis is that EC CD36 is involved in vascular maintenance and regul ation of 
“nutrit ive blood flow”.   
Preliminary data  
Endothelial dysfunction in humans carrying the minor allele (G) of coding CD36 SNP rs3211938  
(Figs. 1 -4): We recently examined effect of treatment with sildenafil, which blocks cyclic GMP (cGMP ) 
degradation on insulin s ensitivity in pre -diabetic subjects .8 In another trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) we examined 
effect  on endothelial function of a 4 -week sildenafil treatment in 
obese African American ( AA) women with metabolic syndrome 
(MetS). Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_31108]36 single nucleoti de polymorphism 
(SNP) rs3211938 was done retrospectively at the end of the trial 
using genomic DNA extracted from blood .9, 10 Samples had 100% 
concordance rate and included validated controls for each group 
(G/G, G/ T, T/T). Endothelial function was assessed with brachial 
artery flow -mediated dilation (FMD). Linear regression was used 
to examine differences between treatment groups and effect of 
genotype.  
G-allele of coding SNP rs3211938 reduces CD36 (Fig. 1 ): The 
minor allele (G) of CD36 rs3211938 introduces a stop codon in 
exon [ADDRESS_30457] a frequency of ~9% in AA ,10, 11 
and was ~13% in our recruited AA women. Genotype frequency (% 
subjects with G -allele) was  ~25% of those screened. The G -allele 
reduces CD36 protein by ~50% in monocytes and platelets10.  
G-allele reduces cyclic GMP levels (Fig. 2 ): To test if the lower CD36 
level in G -allele carriers impacts the NO -cGM P pathway, cGMP levels 
were measured in blood. G -allele carriers (n=12) vs . non-carriers 
(n=31) had 30% less cGMP suggesting  lower NO -cGMP activity.  
G-allele reduces endothelial function  (Fig. 3 ): Endothelial dysfunction 
associates with less vasodilatory response .12-[ADDRESS_30458] of rs3211938 on FMD in GT and TT subjects matched for age 
and BMI and with no metabolic syndrome (MetS) according to ATP 
criteria15 since MetS reduces endothelial function. FMD was 40% 
lower in GT (p=0.035) vs. TT  indicating that the G -allele reduces the 
vasodilatory response to 5 min ischemia.   
G-allele impacts response to sildenafil t herapy (Fig. 4): AA women 
(n=46) with high insulin or 3 of 5 MetS traits participated in a trial 
that examined potential benefits of 4 -week treatment with sildenafil 
vs. placebo in a double blind randomized study. We confirmed 
compliance by [CONTACT_31115]. Forty women completed the study and 34 were 
genotyped for rs3211938 (6 withheld consent). We found a significant 
genotype/drug response interaction: Sildenafil improved FMD in G -

4.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
  6 
8/28/19  Recruitment and informed consent:  We will recruit from the Na shville AA community for this 
planned study. The genotype frequency of the G allele in AA is ~ 25%, we conservatively estimate that 
we need to screen around [ADDRESS_30462]. We will also use 
established Internet resources maintained by [CONTACT_31116] . We may use a screening electronic survey to determine if the volunteer qualifies for the 
study.  All subjects that we screen and genotype for this study will be offered the possibility to participate 
in a CD36 registry. We will u se e-consent to consent the subjects.  
 
5.0 Study Procedures  
 
In our preliminary data, (Fig. 4 ) we observed improvement in endothelial function after a 4 -week 
treatment with sildenafil only in G -allele carriers with  metabolic syndrome  (MetS ). It is well establi shed 
that MetS is associated with endothelial dysfunction.  
In the proposed study, we will recruit AA subjects G -allele carriers that have no evidence of MetS , but 
have  evidence of endothelial dysfunction (Fig. 3 ). We will assess the effect of the PDE5 inh ibitor on 
insulin -stimulated microvascular recruitment and insulin sensitivity after [ADDRESS_30463] to rescue endothelial function, insulin -stimulated microvascular 
recruitment, and to mitigate the deleterious effects of elevated FA on insulin sensitivity in  G-allele 
carriers.

Study Design:  
We will invite subjects to participate in the following visits:  
Pre-screening  (this visit is optional , separate consent ). We will collect  a blood sample for DNA and other 
labs. 
 
Screenin g vis it: We will perform a history and physical , routine labs , including cell blood count, 
comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid profile , single ECG,  and pregnancy test.  Labs will be repeated if 
visit 1 is scheduled more than 3 months after the screening vi sit. 
Visit 1:  If the subject s meet inclusion criteria,  this visit will occur  after overnight fasting . They will 
receive a ~6 -hour saline infusion  in conjunction with  approximately  3-hour “insulin clamp”. L -arginine 
will be infused during the last 30 m in of  the clamp ( see in fusion pro tocol ). Contrast enhanced 
ultrasonography ( CEU ) will be performed.  Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) will be monitored 
throughout the study .  
Visit 2  (will occur at least 2 weeks  after visit 1 ): This visit will occur  in the CRC . Subjects are asked to  
fast overnight . In each study day, a catheter is placed into the antecubital vein for blood sampling. A 
second one is placed in the other antecubit al vein for i nfusions (glucose, insulin, 20% Intralipid®, heparin 
and L -arginine, US contrast agent , (see in fusion protocol ). Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) will be 
monitored throughout the study. The Vanderbilt Investigational Pharmacy will be responsible for d rug 
storage  and di spensing logs.  
Visit 3  (will occur after ~ 4 -week  treatment with sildenafi l 20 mg po three times a day). The last dose of 
sildenafil 20 mg po will be provided the morning of the study and prior to initiation of the “insulin clamp”.  
 
Drug  infusion prot ocol (visits 1, 2 and 3, Fig. 5  B): In visit 1 , subjects will receive i.v. infu sion of 
saline  (45ml/h ) for 6 hour s. During visits 2 and 3 , subjects will receive i.v. 20% Intralipid® (45 ml/hr.) 
and heparin (200 units prime followed by 200 uni ts/hr) for a total  of 6 hours as previously described26. 
Heparin is given to activate endo thelial lipoprotein lipase and to facilitate the conversion of circulating 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_31109]. The “insulin clamp” will start at minute 180 min after initiating the cont inuou s infusion of  
Intralipid® + heparin and will last for 3 additional hours. During the “in sulin clamp”, plasma glucose will 
be clamped at the same basal levels (~90 -95 mg/dl) using variable infusion of IV glucose. Blood samples 
for plasma FA and insulin  will be collected  at -10, 180, 300, 315, 330, 340, 350 and 360 min. Plasma FA s 
will be colle cted with 1 mg/L of tetrahydrolipstatin to prevent in vitro lipolysis27 and measured using the 
NEFA -HR(2) Kit (Wako). We will measure microvascular 
recruitment (M BV) i n the forearm  brachioradialis muscle with 
contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CEU, Fig. 6), and 
measurements of brachial artery diameter and flow  as previously 
described, see techniques. Insulin infusion ( up to 80 mU/m2.min-1) 
will be started at time [ADDRESS_30464] 30 min, we will 
infuse i.v. L -arginine (10 mg/ kg/mi n for 30 minu tes) 24. Then, we 
will repeat ultrasound measurements at the end of the L -argin ine 
infusion to ex amine effect of L -arginine  + sildenafil or L -argin ine + 
intralipi[INVESTIGATOR_31110].

8/28/19  Endpoints: The primary endpoint is the change in MBV (ΔMBV) during insulin infusion from baseline, 
an index of insulin -stimulated micr ovasc ular recruitm ent. We will compare ΔMBV in CD36 G -allele 
carriers with and without chronic sildenafil treatment (primary analysis ) and with and without chronic 
treatment with sildenafil + L -arginine infusion. Secondary measurements are insulin sensitiv ity a s 
measured by  [CONTACT_31117] (M), insulin sensitivity index (M/I), and hemodynamics (BP and HR).  
We hypothesize that chr onic treatment with sildenafil will improve insulin -mediated increases in MBV in 
the CD36 G -allele carriers compared with p laceb o. We do not expect that sildenafil will affect insulin -
mediated increases in MBV in non -carriers. Our preliminary data showed t hat [ADDRESS_30465]. Shibao ( PI) has experience 
infusing Intralipid® and hepari n in humans (NCT02 365285) and in assessing microvascular recruitment 
(Fig.6 ) and blood flow in skeletal muscle 30. [CONTACT_31133] mrad NN has >  25-year experience in the conduct of 
the “insulin clamp” for evaluating insulin resistance and skeletal muscle upt ake31. Further, we do not 
anticipate problems with recruitment of AA volunteers or w ith compliance as we previously reported 32. 
Compliance will be monitored by [CONTACT_31118] -blinding .  
 
Standard Techn iques  
 
Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (“insulin clamp”):  The insulin infusion rate ( up to 80 mU/m2.min-
1) chose n will suppress hepatic glucose production and maximally stimulate peripheral glucose utilization 
allowing measurements of  gluco se utilizatio n and insulin sensitivity 33.   
Contrast -enhanced ultrasound (CEU): Images  will be obtained using a linear -array transducer 
connect ed to  an ultrasoun d (L9 -3 mm transducer, iU22; Phillips). This equipment allows real -time 
imaging using low (0.08) and high (1.2) mechanical index as the contrast (microbubbles; Definity; 
Bristol -Myers Squibb) is infused (1.5 ml/min) for 10 min. At steady state (~4 min) the  high mechanical 
index (1.2) used will destroy the microbubbles at the start of video recording. Switching to the low index 
(0.08) will let microbubbles resonate allowing real -time recording of vascular replenishment. Data are 
analyzed in  our lab using QLA B software34. Our preliminary data in 7 AA (Fig.  14) show baseline MBV 
of 4.0±2.1 (3.8 -4.3, SD 1.1 to 3.2).  
 
 
Optio nal procedure  
Harvesting  of endothelial cells : A 3 J -shaped vascular  guide wire will be advanced into a ntecub ital vein  
and ECs will be retrieved from the wire tips by [CONTACT_31119] (Invitrogen) at 4 C. 
Endothelial identity is verified by [CONTACT_31120] (CD31) and nuclear integrit y by [CONTACT_31121]. 
We can safely recover ~800 EC/ procedure. We will quantify protein levels of eNOS and p -eNOS by 
[CONTACT_31122]. Two -control human umbilical vein EC slides will be included. Captured Images 
will be a nalyzed using Metamorph. EC protein expressi on/HU VEC will minimize the possible confo und 
of differences in intensity of staining among different sessions (see letter of collaboration from Dr. A. 
Gamboa).  For newly conse nted subjects , this procedure  will be  perfo rmed  at the screening visit , if they 
provide  verbal consent . Patients who are already enrolled  and have completed the screening vis it may 
return at any time  to the cli nic to hav e this proc edure . 
 
6.0 Risks  
  9 
8/28/19   
Blood Draws:  Subjects may experience discomfort , bruising, and/or bleeding, or in fection at the needle 
insertion sit e after a blo od draw.  Rarely, some people faint.  Frequent blood sampling may cause anemia. 
We will exclude subjects with hematocrit <34% .  
 
12-hour fast:   Participants may experience hun ger during a [ADDRESS_30466] 
requirement by [CONTACT_31123].  
 
Ultrasound:  The ultrasound test is a safe procedure that uses low -power sound waves. There are no 
direct risks from the ultrasound test.  
 
PDE -5 inhib itors : 
Sildenafil can cause severe  hypotensio n when taken together wi th nitrates o r sGC  stimulator. We have 
included the use of this medication class as an exclusion criterion.  We will monitor BP and HR 
throughout the study. Subjects with BP<90/50 mmHg and  symptoms of  hypotension at any pr essure will  
be discontinued . 
PDE5 - inhibitors ma y cause prolonged erection (4 hours) or priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801] (painful erections > 6 hours). In 
addition, PDE -[ADDRESS_30467] been report ed to cause headaches, dyspepsia, back pain, flu shing , nasal 
congestion, and myalg ia or limb pain. In prior studies b y our group, headaches were more common  
among subjects randomized to a PDE -5 inhibitor than placebo.  
Reports of changes in color vision (an effect of PDE -5 inhibition) are observed with s ildenafil citrate.  
An association of PDE -5 inhibitor use with acute h earing loss a nd non -arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy  
(rare) has been reported. The causal relationship between PDE -[ADDRESS_30468] that we studied.  
 
Hyperinsulinemic clamp:  
There is a risk of hypoglycemia during the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps.  Glucose concentrations 
will be monitored every 5 minutes dur ing th e ins ulin clamp. We will infu se variable r ate of 20% glucose 
to prevent hypoglycemia. [CONTACT_31134] has more than 25 years’ experience  using this technique to assess 
for insulin sensitivity in humans.  A CRC nurse and a  physician will be present at all times durin g the 
insulin clamps . 
 
Intravenous Ca ther Insertion:  
Inserting a plastic catheter into the vein may cause a brief amount of pain and possibly a small bruise at 
the site, but will allow us to draw blood without repeated sticks throughout the stu dy. It is a lso possible to 
develop an infection at the location of the catheter. It is uncomfortable to have the intravenous catheter in 
place for any length of time because it causes discomfort when the patient moves thei r arm.  
 
Ultrasound contrast agent:  
There is s mall risk of arrhythmias , chest pain,  hypotension, and dyspnea with use of ultrasound contrast  
agents (microbubbles; Definity; Bristol -Myers Squibb). Subjects will be informed about this risk.  
 
Intralipid®: 
In some people, headache, dizziness, f lushing, dr owsiness, nausea, vomiti ng, or sweati ng may occur after 
taking Intralipid®. Other serious side effects include signs of infection (fever, persistent sore throat), 
pain/swelling/redness at  injection site, pain/sw elling/redness of arms/legs, bluis h skin, sud den weight 
gain, shortne ss of breath and back/chest  pain.

8/28/[ADDRESS_30469]. Shibao  (or designee) if any of 
these rare but very serious side effects occ ur: mental/mood changes, bone pain , muscle we akness, 
yellowing skin/e yes, dark uri ne, easy bruising/bleeding, severe stomach/abdominal pain, trouble  
breathing , or any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of  
the face/tongue/throat), severe  dizziness, t rouble breathing.  
 
Hepar in: 
In some p eople, heparin can cause abdominal or stomach pain or swelling, back pain or backaches, 
bleeding from the gums when brushing teeth, blood in the urine, constipation, coughing  up blood, 
dizziness, headaches, h eavy bleedi ng or oozing from cuts o r wounds, joi nt pain, stiffness, or swelling, 
unexpected or unusually heavy menstrual bleeding,  unexplained bruising or purplish areas on the skin, 
unexplained nosebleeds, or vomiting of blood or material that looks  like coffee grou nds. These side 
effects are uncommon.  
Rarely, heparin may cause blood under the skin (blood blister) at the place of injection, chest  pain, chills 
or fever, fast or irregular breathing, irritation, pain, redness , or ulcers at the place of inject ion, itchin g and 
burning feeling, e specially on  the bottom of the feet, nausea or vomiting, numbness or tingling in the 
hands or feet, pain, coldness, or blue color of the  skin on the arms or legs, peeling of the skin, puf finess or 
swelling of the eyelids or around t he eyes, shortness of  breath, skin co lor change, especially near the place 
of injection or in the fingers, toes, arms, or legs, skin rash, hives, or  itching, tearing of the eyes, tightness 
in the chest, or troub le with breathing.  
 
L-arginine :  
Due to the h ypertonicity of the solu tion, the med ication needs to be administer ed via IV infusion.  
Extravasation has resulted in burn -like reactions and skin necrosis requiring surgical intervention. 
Excessive rates of infu sion (e .g. < 30 minutes) may resul t in local irritation, flushing, na usea, or vomi ting. 
Other side effects associated with this medication are headaches, numbness.  
 
Breach of Confidentiality : 
In the event of a security breach, confidential information may be stolen. We have strong security  
procedures  in place to minimize th e possibility  of a breach.  Alt hough we cannot provide a 100% 
guarantee that the participant’s data will be safe, our procedures minimize the chance that a breach would 
take place.  
 
Ther e is no benefit of the proposed research to th e subjects per se.  AA ar e genetically  predisposed to 
endothelial dysfunction. Our  study will determine if a genetic variation in the CD36 receptor associated 
with a ~50% decreased expression is  associated with a  reduction in insulin vascular act ions and/or  
negative metabolic outc ome such as r educed  insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in the setting of 
elevated FA. Furthermore, our study will determine if  these abnormalities could be prevented with the use 
of sildenafil citrate.

to the IRB. Any untoward medical event will be classified as an adverse event, regardless of its causal 
relations hip with th e study. An AE will be c lassified as serious if it a) results in death, b) is life -
threatening, c) requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], d) results in

Neph rology at Vanderbilt University , the Data and Safety Monitoring Off icer (DSMO), and the IRB 
within 7 days of the  PI’s notification of th e event. Non -serious, unexpected adverse events will be 
reported to the IRB at the time of the annual continuing review.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan : The protocol will be reviewed an d 
approved by [CONTACT_31124]. The investigators will closely oversee the 
protocol in conjunction with the dedicated research fellow. A Data and Safety Monitoring Officer (DSMO) 
will provi de objective review of treatment r esults as t hey relate to human safe ty and data q uality. The 
officer will be [CONTACT_31135] A. Ikizler. The DSMO will meet with the investigators prior to the initiation of the 
study to review the protocol and after one-third of the subjects have been enrolled i n the study , to receive 
reports of the progress of the study. These reports will provide information regarding recruit ment , safety 
reporting and data quality. No early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31111]. The DSMO will assess safety data including 
hypoglycemia, hypotensio n, common a dverse events and other serious AEs. Interim data will be provided 
to the committee by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Yu and the PIs (Drs. Shibao and Abumrad NN).  
The DMSO will have the authority to modify the protocol or to terminate th e study if it deems such actions 
to be warran ted. The DSMO will provi de summary re ports to the IRB and the investigators.  
The DSMO will review all serious AEs. Any serious AE will be reported to the DSMO, IRB, and NIH 
(and FDA if appropriate) as soon as po ssible, but not more than seven  days from the  investigators’ 
awarenes s of the even t. Any untoward medical event will be classified as an AE, regardless of its causal 
relationship with the study. An AE will be classified as serious if it a) results in death , b) is life -
threatening, c) requi res inpatie nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31112], d) results in 
persistent or significant disability or incapacity, e) is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
Non-serious, unexpected AEs will be r eported to the IRB at the time of annual revi ew, unless we observe 
a pattern of su ch events, in which case we expect the DSMO will recommend earlier notification at the 
time of quarterly review. If warranted, appropriate changes will be made to the consent  form. AEs will be 
graded as mild (no limitat ion of usual activities) , moderate (s ome limitation), or severe (inability to carry 
out usual activities) and attributed according to the relationship to the study drug and/or procedures as Not 
related, Unlikely , Possible, Probable, or Definite.  Any instan ce of non -compliance wit h the protoco l will 
be reported at the time of annual review. Summary Reports will be submitted to the IRB at least annually 
and will contain a) The number of AEs and an explanation of ho w each event was handled, and b) T he 
number o f complaints and how eac h complaint w as handled, c) The number of subject withdrawals and 
an explanation of why the subject withdrew or was withdrawn, and d) The number of instances of non -
compliance with the pr otocol and how each was handled.  
 
8.0 Study With drawal/Discontinuation  
 
Criteria for study withdrawal/discontinuation  
 
• Drug -related toxicity  
• Requirement for prohibited concomitant medications (see exclusion criteria)  
• Pregnancy  
• Request by [CONTACT_31125]  
• Clinical reasons believe d to be life threatening by [CONTACT_31126], even if not addressed on the 
potential risk section (Section 7.0)  
 
9.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
  12 
8/28/19  Data Analysis Plan : We have chosen a sample size based on the power to detect diffe rences in our 
primary endpoint, in sulin -stimu lated MBV as measured by  [CONTACT_31127]. Our pre liminary data showed baseline 
MBV measure with a mean in the range of 3.8 to 4.3 and an SD in the range of 1.1 to 3.2 ( average 
mean±SD: 4.0±2.1, Fig.6 ). In our previou s study  (preliminary data, Fig. 4), we di d not obser ve any 
improvement in en dothelial fun ction after a 4 -week treatment with sildenafil in non -carriers whereas in 
G-allele carriers endothelial function as measured by [CONTACT_31128] 40% (mean±SD: from 4.8±2.2 to 
8.0±2.2). We assume sildenafil wil l have no e ffect on MBV among the n on-carriers a nd sildenafil will 
increase CEU conservatively by [CONTACT_2902] 30% among the G -allele carriers. A paired t -test will have 84% 
power to detect a 30% increase of CEU to 5.[ADDRESS_30472] -silde nafil treatment compared to placeb o (4.0±2.1,  
mean±SD), assuming a wi thin-subject correlation coefficient of 0.6 with a sample size of 24. The type I 
error rate is 0.05 and the study is on G carriers. We conservatively estimated 20% of dropout rate, and 
therefore we will enroll 30 subjects  in this pr otocol. For insulin sens itivity (seco ndary endp oint), as 
previously shown25 Intralipid® + heparin infusion decreased glucose infusion rate from 5.6±2.3 to 
4.5±1.7mg/kg/mi n. Our study has 81% power to dete ct a simila r difference using an SD  for the with in-
subject difference of 1.8 (calculated using the higher SD of 2.[ADDRESS_30473] correlation 
coefficient of 0.7).  
 
Data Analyses : Standard graphing and screening  techniques will be used to detect  outliers a nd to ensure 
data accura cy. We will a ssess continuous outcomes for normality. If normality is violated, we will apply 
data transformation or consider non -parametric analysis methods. Summary statistics for both continuous 
and categorical variabl es will be provided by [CONTACT_10609] ( intralipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], intr alipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]+sildenafil to describe the 
study sample.  Our analysis will use mixed effect models with a random subject effect and treatment 
(intralipi[INVESTIGATOR_31113]. intralipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]+sildenafil ), genotype (G -allele carriers vs.  non-carrie rs), and their interacti on as 
fixed e ffects.  
 
 
 
10.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
All data will be collected specifically for the proposed research project. A unique identification case 
number will be used to pro tect the confidentiality of the st udy partici pants. Only case numbers  will be 
included in spreadsheets used for the statistical analysis. PHI and access to the key for the ID numbers 
will only be viewable by [CONTACT_8362]. Member s of the res earch team will have access to 
the patient's medical record during th e screening v isit and throughout the study until the patient completes 
her participation in the study or meets any of the criteria for study withdrawal/discontinuation.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_30474] three  (3) years fr om the date the research is closed with 
the Vanderbilt University IRB. All research records will be accessible for inspection and copying by 
[CONTACT_31129], federal regulatory agency re presentativ es, and the department o r 
agency supp orting the research.  
 
All Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) -related documentation will be 
maintained for at least six (6) years from the date of th e last use or disclosure of the Pr otected Hea lth 
Information (PHI).

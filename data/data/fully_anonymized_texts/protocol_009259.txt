1. Provide a brief (less than 2500 characters) abstract of the research protocol.
(2500 characters)
This summary should include: 1)) a brief description of the purpose of the study, 2)
eligibility criteria, 3) interventions and evaluations and 4) follow-up.
BounceBack Now (BBN) is a self-help, trauma-focused mental health mobile app with
automated assessment with treatment guidance and in-app evidence-based treatment
support for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep difficulties, and
anxiety. BBN contains many of the necessary components to promote self-management of
these conditions. We will evaluate the apps feasibility and acceptability among underserved
patients (e.g., African Americans and patient with lower socioeconomic status) with trauma
histories in an integrated primary care (IPC) setting. There are two specific aims: 1) to
develop educational materials for patients and behavioral health providers for BBN in IPC,
and 2) to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_109246]. To
achieve Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups with behavioral health providers and patients to
obtain feedback about BBN and training materials. For Aim 2, a feasibility study with 15
patients will be conducted to identify and address any procedural issues and to refine the
protocol before conducting the full-scale study.
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND BACKGROUND
2. Purpose of the Study 
What are the specific scientific objectives of the research?
1. Develop educational materials for patients with trauma exposure and behavioral health
providers for BBN in IPC emphasizing needs of two health disparity populations: African
American and low-income patients.
2. Conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_109247].
3. Background and Rationale 
Describe the background of the study. Include a critical evaluation of existing
knowledge, and specifically identify the information gaps that the project is intended to
fill.
A majority of US residents (56.7%) with mental health needs do not receive care.1
Racial/ethnic minority groups face significant gaps in care, with African Americans receiving
care at 60% the rate of Whites. Within this context, primary care has become the de-facto
mental health system, treating the largest share of those with common mental health
conditions.2 Integrated Primary Care (IPC) models of mental health care appear to reduce
these disparities of access but face challenges in treating trauma-related mental health,
Version 14 - PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121129] (IRB)
IRB PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121130] majority of patients attend two or fewer sessions.3,4 Improving
equity in trauma-focused outcomes is a critical public health need, particularly with the
persistent disparities in traumatic event exposure and related mental health.5 Unfortunately,
efficacious treatments for trauma-related concerns in IPC require a minimum of eight weekly
sessions.6 Moreover, successful trauma-focused IPC interventions build on treatments that
also face challenges in maintaining fidelity in traditional psychotherapy settings7 that often
treat even less clinical diversity than IPC. We hypothesize that trauma-focused clinician
guides that can function in primary care, while also supporting patients who may be unable
to attend the suggested several sessions, may hold substantial promise for improving
outcomes and equity among racial/ethnic minority and/or low-income populations. Mobile
health tools are well-positioned to serve as both clinician guides and patient self-
management tools. Mobile in-session guides appear effective in increasing fidelity to trauma-
focused care,8,9and similar self-management apps significantly reduce depression and post-
traumatic stress disorder, even without clinician guidance.10The proposed project addresses
critical knowledge gaps: 1) Lack of training materials for patients and providers to implement
a mobile app intervention to treat trauma related disorders in integrated care settings; and 2)
Lack of clinical protocol to use the mobile app intervention to treat trauma related disorders
in integrated care settings.
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SUBJECT POPULATION
4. Accrual 
A. Is this study conducted solely at sites under the oversight of the UNMC IRB (e.g.
UNMC, Nebraska Medicine, CHMC, UNO)?
Yes
1. How many subjects will need to be consented (per group, as applicable) in order to
achieve the scientific objectives of the research?
Aim 1: Total 14 - 10 patients and 4 behavioral health providers
Aim 2: Total 45 - Patients (15), BHPs (10), Clinical staff, providers and administration (20)
2. What is the statistical or other justification for the total number of subjects described
above?
Because of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_109248], it is not anticipated that quantitative results will
achieve statistical significance. The data will primarily serve to demonstrate feasibility of our
approach and success recruitment for a larger clinical trial. We aim for the number indicated
in Section II 4 A 1, based on our ability to recruit patients at the clinic during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_109249].
5. Gender of the Subjects 
Version 14 - PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121131] (IRB)
IRB PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page 10 of 44
A. Are there any enrollment restrictions based on gender?
No
6. Age Range of Subjects 
A. Will adults be enrolled ?
Yes
1. What is the age range of the adult subjects?
19 years and older
2. What is the rationale for selecting this age range?
This study aims to explore smartphone app technology in the adult population. We have
determined in our previous work with this population that the adults being served at this
clinic location have an interest in using mobile apps.
B. Will children (18 years of age or younger) be included in this research?
No
1. What is the justification for excluding children from participating in this research?
Research is irrelevant to children (e.g. disease or condition rarely encountered in children). 
Knowledge being sought in the research is already available for children or will be obtained
from another ongoing study. 
♦ A separate study in children is warranted and preferable.
Insufficient data are available in adults to judge the potential risk in children. 
Other. Explain. 
7. Race and Ethnicity 
Are there any subject enrollment restrictions based upon race or ethnic origin?
No
8. Vulnerable Subjects 
A. Will prisoners be included in the research?
No
B. Select from the list all of the vulnerable populations that will specifically be recruited
to participate in this research.

Other. 
No vulnerable subjects will be specifically recruited 
Describe the additional safeguards to protect the rights and welfare of the
educationally disadvantaged individuals.
1. An informed consent detailing the procedure and purpose of the study will be
implemented. The researchers will ensure that participants understand that participation is
completely voluntary with option of withdrawal at any time.
2. In an effort to protect the rights and welfare of educationally disadvantaged individuals
delayed consent will be offered. In the event that the study personnel and/or the potential
participant appears to need additional time to process the information necessary to make an
informed decision additional time will be allotted to do so. The potential participant will also
be encouraged to contact a family member or significant other to assist them in making an
informed decision about whether or not to participate. The consent document will be
reviewed with the participant, the study personnel will answer their questions, ensure their
understanding of the study, give them a copy of the informed consent and ask them to think
over their potential participation.
3. For semi-structured interviews, participants will be mailed a copy of the consent form one-
week prior to their participation or handed the consent at their baseline surveys. They will be
encouraged to review the consent form, prior to the interview meeting and discuss their
participation with a member of their family or a friend. At the interview, the consent form will
be read aloud and they will have an opportunity to individually ask questions with research
personnel. Participants will also be assured that their participation (or not) will not impact
their relationship with clinic staff.

with a stigmatizing illness or condition.
1. Previously, when we conducted a focus group (approved by [CONTACT_109272]), we explained to
the patient participants ahead of time that the data will be collected in a group setting with
individuals who have a diagnosis of depression. For this study, we will use the same
approach, and highlight with the patients during the consent process that the study will be
conducted in a group setting and be comprised of individuals who have diagnosis of a
mental health condition to participate in the focus group.
2. The focus group will be conducted only by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Dinkel and student research assistants so
that other project team members will not know the identity of the patients.
3. For semi-structured interviews/focus groups participants will be mailed a copy of the
consent form one-week prior to their participation or handed the consent at their baseline
surveys. They will be encouraged to review the consent form, prior to the interview meeting
and discuss their participation with a member of their family or a friend. At the interview, the
consent form will be read aloud and they will have an opportunity to individually ask
questions with research personnel. Participants will also be assured that their participation
(or not) will not impact their relationship with clinic staff.
4. Prior to the start of the focus group/interview, all participants will be reminded the
following of the inclusion criteria and the importance of protecting one another's privacy.
Prior to the group starting the research team will instruct the participants that the members
of the group and information that is shared within the group should not be shared outside
the group to protect one another's privacy and confidentiality. We will reinforce the
importance of not putting private information into the apps during mobile app exploration.
6. Any study related materials will be locked in the cabinet of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_109250]-protected project folder in the server, which can be only accessible by [CONTACT_109273].

No
B. Describe the research plan, including all procedures, interventions, evaluations and
tests.
BounceBack Now:
BBN was developed at the Medical University of South Carolina and [CONTACT_109324]
participated in the app development. UNMC does not have anything to do with the app
development.
After consent has been completed a BHP will assist the participant in downloading BBN
onto their smartphone device for Aim 2. The current BBN structure contains a brief
assessment and multiple treatment components for disorders that are frequently associated
with traumatic event exposure. A brief assessment based on the Kessler 6 will be
completed, based on this assessment the participants are then guided to treatment
recommendations with an interactive rationale for each treatment. Education/explanations
are provided in written, spoken, and animated video formats. Given that each of these
treatments may be beneficial for patients with subsyndromal or very minor symptoms, all
patients are able to see and interact with all treatment components, but it is anticipated that
BHPs will provide recommendations for the sections that will be most beneficial. The
treatment components are each based on effective in-person interventions. These include
behavioral activation (depression), Written Exposure Therapy, and Expressive Writing
(PTSD), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Sleep, and Relaxation/Mindfulness
(stress/anxiety). The corresponding app sections are titled Activate, Write, Sleep, and
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_109251], respectively. Each of these sections contains education components and
there is a separate education component for the app overall that can be found through the
copi[INVESTIGATOR_109252]. An overview of each treatment component and its designed target is
included below in table format.
BBN  Component Function
Initial Assessment Identify symptoms, direct to appropriate intervention
Relaxation/Mindfulness Reduce mild symptoms of anxiety
Behavioral Activation Reduce depression symptoms
CBT for Sleep Increase sleep duration and efficiency
Writing Exposures Decrease trauma-related anxiety and avoidance
Psychoeducation Basic and disorder-specific mental health education

Aim 1:  Participants will be recruited in one of two ways for aim one. The first is patients who present to
their behavioral health care provider (Nathan Howland or Sarah Wolinsky), will be offered the
opportunity to participate in focus groups/one on one semi-structured interviews to review the BBN
(Bounce Back Now) trauma app. The behavioral health providers (BHPs) will discuss the study and
refer interested participants. For interested participants, the BHP will provide them with a QR code that
links directly to a Redcap survey that first presents the description of the study and initial screening
eligibility assessment. If requested, BHPs will assist participants in scanning the QR code to obtain
the link to the study. Basic information about the study will be shown first and state that we are
interested in learning about how to better use mobile apps to benefit care for trauma-related mental
health concerns (phrased to participants as emotional or mental health problems related to extremely
stressful or traumatic events). Eligible participants will be directed to a page where they can
electronically complete the IRB-approved consent form via Redcap. On this page, participants will
affirm that they have read and understood the consent form and agree to participate in order to
proceed. If they indicate that they decline to participate, they will be directed to a page that thanks
them for their time. Once they complete the consent form, the redcap survey will ask for contact
[CONTACT_109279] (IE phone call, text
message or email.)
The second way participants may volunteer for the study is through promotional materials placed
within the clinic and via clinicaltrials.gov registry or UNMC research database. These approaches help
ensure inclusive opportunities for interested participants who may have or may have previously had
experienced trauma-related mental health concerns who are not actively receiving care from a BHP, as
their perspectives on the use of the app would still help inform any future adaptations. The in-clinic
promotional materials will contain basic information about the study (i.e., that they can help us
improve mental health apps), contain the QR code that links to the Redcap information and screening
page (which asks their age and if they are receiving care from the approved Fontenelle or Midtown
locations), and contact [CONTACT_109280].
If the interested participant reaches out to a member of the research team through the clinical trials
registry or UNMC research database via email as opposed to scanning a QR code the participant will
be emailed the Redcap link which will contain the above described content in addition to resource
materials.. The QR code and link for the participants recruited via flyers and trials registry will differ
from the ones that BHPs will use to recruit. . This is done because these participants may not have an
existing relationship with a BHP and may not currently be engaged in BH services. We therefore will
present different information at the end of the screening and consent process to inform them that they
may request BH services from their clinic and we will provide a list of BH resources that they may
access if they would like to seek services for mental health. For all of the above recruitment methods,
using the QR code and screening/consent/download link in this manner, helps reduce barriers to
participation and simplifies the process of completing measures and accessing the application.
Educational materials for patients and Behavioral Health Providers (BHPs) for BBN in IPC will be
developed.
[CONTACT_109325] and her research assistants will present the educational materials and BBN in focus groups.
We will conduct one focus group for behavioral health providers and one to two focus groups for
patients or offer individual virtual meetings (in order to accommodate their schedule, we may need to
have two separate focus group for patients or individual times to participants). Upon semi-structured
interview or focus group, a member of the research team will review the consent form contained in the
Version 14 - PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121141] (IRB)
IRB PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page 17 of 44
Redcap survey and reconfirm that patient understands and wishes to proceed. The re-verification of
this information will serve as verification of consent. (Electronic Consent). These focus groups may be
conducted virtually (i.e., zoom call) or in-person. The focus group will last [ADDRESS_121142] not already done so. A basic tutorial of
the BBN and the developed educational materials will be conducted/reviewed with the participants.
After the tutorial and education has been provided the participants will be asked to try some of major
features of the app. Then, they will be asked to review the patient education materials. They will be
asked to discuss strengths and weaknesses of the materials. They will be also asked whether there is
any content missing from the education material. Finally, they will be asked to assess usability of the
material. At the completion of the focus group the research team will assist the participants in
removing BBN from their phones.
As for the provider focus group, a similar process will be used to ask about the provider educational
materials and patient educational materials. We will also collect the following information including
gender, age, job, years in practice, and years at the clinic.
Focus groups will be audio recorded and a transcript will be prepared. Information obtained from the
focus groups will be used to refine the patient and provider educational materials before we implement
Aim 2 activities.
Aim 2: Conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_109253], UNL Faculty will be the PI [INVESTIGATOR_109254], He currently
provides patient care services at these locations in addition to overseeing the work of other BHPs at
the identified Bluestem sites.
Margaret Emerson, UNMC faculty, will be the PI [INVESTIGATOR_109255].
Recruitment will take place in two ways:
1.) Baseline
Prior to engagement with the BBN application and as part of standard care at the clinic, a primary care
provider at one of the specified Fontenelle, Downtown, Midtown or Bluestem Clinic locations will do a
standard "warm handoff" referral to a behavioral health provider (BHP) if the patient is determined to
have a behavioral health issue. All participants under Aim [ADDRESS_121143] had BBN recommended to them by [CONTACT_109281] 2 research. For any
adult participants (i.e., 19+ years of age) to whom they introduce BBN, BHPs will be asked to advertise
a research study on the use, perceptions and initial effectiveness of BBN. To do so, they will use flyers
with a QR code that links to a Redcap survey. The BHP will inform the patient that participation in the
Version 14 - PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121144] (IRB)
IRB PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121145] with this link after the
session has ended, which will reduce both patient and provider burden by [CONTACT_109282]. The BHP will be trained to problem solve QR code usage with the patient to ensure they can
access the link before leaving. The Redcap survey will begin with a modified consent form (it is
modified in accordance with the prior waiver of written consent we received previously where
participant will confirm the consent electronically). If participants agree to participate in the study, they
will then complete a series of questionnaires. All questionnaires are standard in survey research and
do not contain any items that identify risk or result in significant distress. They are listed under
Research Assessment below. The measures do contain an assessment of stressful event exposure,
but prior studies indicate that such measures do not significantly increase participant distress and
more frequently report research studies involving such measure as a positive experience overall (Jaffe
et al., 2015). Further, the consent procedures will explicitly suggest that participants complete the
survey in a private setting and inform the participants that the study will contain questions about
stressful life experiences. Additionally, participants will be afforded the opportunity to complete the
study in a private setting at the clinic, though we anticipate some participants may choose to complete
the survey after. They will be advised that they should complete the consent form and survey within
two days of their appointment. At the end of the survey, they will be given information that they should
reach out to their BHP if they would like to further discuss any symptoms or topi[INVESTIGATOR_109256]. The
Redcap will also automatically redirect to a separate survey where participants can provide contact
[CONTACT_109283]-up phone surveys (see Follow-up Phone surveys below).
Participants will be able to provide contact [CONTACT_109284]-up phone surveys. Participants will also be able to indicate a preference for completing
follow-up surveys electronically and receiving the link via email or text or completing the survey over
the phone. They will be asked to provide the contact [CONTACT_109285].
The patient will continue to meet with their BHP as determined by [CONTACT_109286].
And, if deemed appropriate the BHP will highlight features contained in BBN for patient to use in
between appointments.
2.) Recruitment for the study will occur in the manner described above in addition to this advertising
opportunity to participate using Opt-in registry email which is described below.
The opt in registry will be used to identify patients who meet the inclusion criteria and who have had
an appointment with the BHP at one of the participating sites within the last three to six months. The
Opt in email will provide basic information about the study and include a link which will take the
interested participants to the same redcap survey described above which contains the informed
consent, contact [CONTACT_109287], followed by [CONTACT_109288].
Participants choosing to participate with the Opt-in format will have already an established
relationship with the BHP, documented trauma condition within the electronic health record and
expressed interest in participating by [CONTACT_109289]-in initial inquiry. Upon completion of the
initial baseline data collection from the participants, BHPs will made aware of the patients expressed
interest through the opt-in recruitment process in order to incorporate the app use into subsequent
standard of care appointments with the patient. This process will mimic the in-person appointments.
Follow-Up Phone Calls
Version 14 - PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121146] (IRB)
IRB PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page 19 of 44
The follow-up phone calls will be scheduled for 2 week and 6 weeks after the initial baseline data
collection. Participants will be notified of these surveys through the mode of communication they
indicated at baseline. If they indicated a preference for online surveys, they will be sent a link to the
surveys. If they elected to complete them by [CONTACT_648], the participant will be contact[CONTACT_426] a member of
the research team to complete follow-up surveys. Similar to the baseline data collection, they survey
may be completed online or administered by [CONTACT_109290]. The two-week
follow-up surveys will be identical to the baseline surveys.
The 6-week follow-up survey will be completed in the same fashion as the two-week survey. It will
contain the same measures as the 2-week survey including that patient usability of the app will be
assessed using the 18-item mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ). Patient acceptability will be
measured using the 20-item User Burden Scale. Additionally, participants will be invited to complete
semi-structured interviews about their use experience to be completed at a later date and will be
prompted to provide their preferred contact [CONTACT_109291].
The Use of BBN
Usage of the app is entirely self-paced. While some features do have recommended intervals for use
(e.g., weekly writing), users are able to schedule these at any interval they choose. The app will be
introduced to the participant by [CONTACT_109292] a shared decision-making
framework where providers and participants collaborate to discuss how to best use the application.
The app will only capture data pertaining to utilization, which will include initial login date, last use
date, number of logins, and number of times each component is accessed.
Focus Group and Semi-Structured Interviews for Aim [ADDRESS_121147] (Flottrop, 2013). The interviews will occur in a
private location at the clinic or via Zoom, be audio recorded, and last no longer than [ADDRESS_121148] which includes: Recommendations,
Individual and Health professional factors. Professional behaviors, Patient Factors, Professional
Interactions, Incentives and Resources, Capacity for Organizational Change, Social, Political, and
Legal Factors which relate to the feasibility and implementation efforts of mobile app integration within
the clinical setting. The interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed.
The semi-structured interviews with patients will be guided by [CONTACT_109293]. The interviews will occur in a private location
at the clinic or via Zoom, be audio recorded, and last no longer than 1 hour. Specifically, with the
patient interviews, patients will be asked about the following: 1) the overall usability of of BBN, 2) the
overall acceptability of BBN, 3) each major components of BBN, 4) the feasibility of incorporating BBN
into the clinical practice, 5) the ease of using BBN to complete the surveys, and 6) strengths and

RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
16. Potential Risks 
What are the potential risks associated with each research procedure, intervention,
evaluation and/or test? If data are available, estimate the probability that a given harm
may occur and its potential reversibility.
We anticipate the minimal risk associated with the use of BBN. BBN has been studied
extensively and found to produce no known harms to the patients. However, it is possible
that the use of some features of the app may trigger some negative psychological response.
In case, the patient experiences any negative consequences from using the app, the patient
will directed to contact [CONTACT_109301].
The potential risks to subjects associated with the study interactions are deemed to be
minimal. We do not anticipate any physical risks. The psychological, social, cultural,
financial, and legal risks are breach of confidentiality which may result in negative
psychological experience. Risks to privacy and/or confidentiality are minimal as the focus
group participants will not be asked to provide personal health information and we will
adhere to IRB privacy and confidentiality standards for each aim of the study. We will
however review all risks and ensure informed consent is completed with each participant
prior to the start of the study. In order to protect patient privacy, we will use assign unique
study IDs to the patients. The BHPs, who have ethical access to the participants, will keep
the spreadsheet that contains the participants name [CONTACT_109323].
17. Risk Classification 
What is the overall risk classification of the research?
♦ Minimal risk
Greater than minimal risk 
18. Minimization of Risk 
A. Describe how the subjects of the research will be monitored by [CONTACT_109302].
Members of the focus groups will be informed that individuals who recruited for the purpose
of the study have been Identified through their involvement with their BHP as a result of
being referred due to a mental health condition.
Participants who contact [CONTACT_109303] 14 - PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121164] (IRB)

(DSMB) provide the charter, or describe (1) the composition of the DSMB membership,
(2) the frequency of DSMB meetings and reports.
With regard to data safety issues, Health Information Technology Solutions (HITS), the
company that manages BBN on servers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC)
utilizes secure, confidential, user-friendly digital spaces. These are an n-tier architecture
with responsive multichannel capability such that participating clinical staff, which we refer to
as advocates, can access the components via a HIPAA compliant website or mobile
application on smartphone or tablet (IOS, Android, Windows, etc.). HITS has proven
software development architecture that allows for seamless delivery of content in a
consistent, customized experience regardless of device, media form, or operating system.
Respondent confidentiality will be masked by [CONTACT_109304]. Moreover, all data will be stored using resources located in the HITS
facilities in the School of Nursing at Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) until de-
identification is complete. Electronic data will be stored on secure, password-protected
computers/servers on site. De-identified use data will be transferred to investigators at UNL
via secure, cloud-base storage. These data will be linked with interview data via cross-
linking of app initiation dates and times, which will prevent even HITS staff from ever having
access to identifiable information of users. The interview data and combined interview data
will be stored at UNL facilities through secure servers at the Rural Drug Addiction Research
Center (RDAR). When processed data are ready for data analyses, those analyses will be
performed through protected storage at UNL.
C. Describe the auditing plan for research conducted. Identify who will conduct the
audits and specify the audit frequency.
Either [CONTACT_109326] or [CONTACT_109327] will audit the study at the 6-month point.
D. Describe the specific subject withdrawal criteria.
Participants will be withdrawn if he/she voluntarily withdraws his or her consent to
participate in a study at any time for any reason. Participants will also be withdrawn if any
time they are experiencing any indication of suicidality and/or experiencing difficulty, either
physically or mentally, with the study. Should this occur these events will follow the current
Version 14 - PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121166] (IRB)

E. Describe the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_109263] (e.g., the specific criteria for halting or
early termination of the study).
If for some reason the participant becomes upset during the interview, the qualitative
researcher will bring the interview to the end, thank the participant for his/her participation
and be available afterward to discuss any concerns participants may have. If [ADDRESS_121168] injury.
This research involves mobile app use and survey/interview-based primary data collection in
a safe indoor environment. There is no intervention or any other physical or medical
procedure that may pose a risk of a research-related injury to the subjects. However, if any
subject expresses distress related to questions asked or discussed, they will be referred to
their primary care provider for follow-up, either through self-referral or referral made by [CONTACT_109305].
19. Potential Benefits to the Subject 
Is there the prospect for direct benefit (eg, research on diagnosis or treatment of
disease)?
No
20. Potential Benefits to Society 
Describe the potential benefits to society that may reasonably be expected to result
from this research.
The project can potentially generate information to improve the trauma informed access to
care among vulnerable patients. While there is a minimal risk involving the breach of
information, such risk is deemed reasonable given the potential for the benefit of the

No
29. Process of Informed Consent 
A. When will the prospective subject/parent(s)/guardian(s)/LAR be approached relative
to their/the subject's actual participation in the study?
For Aim 1 participants will be recruited with 2 methods. For Aim 1,
patients who are interested as identified through clinical trial registry will
be contact[CONTACT_426] a member of the research team to review participation in
the study and determine eligibility criteria and if eligible will complete the
informed consent process for the semi-structured focus groups.
For Aim 1 only the BHPs (Nathan Howland and Sarah Wolinski) who are
listed on this IRB application with ethical access will identify any
participants that may be interested in the study.
For Aim 2, Participants will be identified using two strategies 1.) BHPs at
any of the study sites will identify participants who are interested in the
study and 2.) Participants who meet the opt in criteria will be sent an
email communication which provides brief summations of the study.
BHP will advertise the opportunity to participant in the research study
during their standard of care appointment. Any participant who wishes to
participate and meets eligibility criteria, will complete the informed
consent process with one of the study site research staff or if preferred
by [CONTACT_102], through the QR code/survey link for consent completion.
Version 14 - PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121180] (IRB)
IRB PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121181] time to ask questions.
Participants, at this time, will decide whether they wish to participate or
not. It is estimated that the provider reading the informed consent
document, answering participants' questions, and assuring
understanding of the study will take 5-10 minutes, but additional time will
be used if needed for delayed consent or discussion with family/friends if
the patient desires and/or the BHP or research investigator believes they
need more time to decide.
Approved methods pertaining to UNMC E-Consents will be used in the
instance that the participant is presenting virtually for participation.
Additionally for those who wish to participate through the use of the QR
code then consent will be presented in this format for the patient to
review and sign electronically with the research staff being available to
answer any questions. Prior to starting the focus group or interview a
member of the research team will review the interview portion of the
study to ensure that the participant clearly understands and consents to
participate in this portion of the study.
For Aim 2, the BHP will approach his/her patient during the clinic visit.
B. Where will informed consent be obtained, and how will the environment be
conducive to discussion and thoughtful consideration?
All eligible patient participants will be made aware of the study through communications
provided via approved opt-in communication or by [CONTACT_109312] a private confidential office or zoom setting or from
access to research registry related information.
If the patient is interested in hearing more about participating in the study during a standard
of care appointment the behavioral health care provider will review the informed consent
content and details if they are approved for this IRB application.
In the instance the patient wishes to hear more about the study based on clinical trial
registry a member of the research team will complete phone communication using the same
procedures. If the patient wishes to participate after understanding of the informed consent
is demonstrated the patient will be asked to sign electronic consent with an UNMC
Version 14 - PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121182] (IRB)
IRB PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121183] in a face to face format or mailed (
electronic or postal mail) the consent for patient to sign and return one. A copy of the
consent will be provided to the participant if the visit is conducted in person and mailed or
emailed to the patient for virtual visits.
In the event that the participant wishes to use the QR code to begin study then the
participant will be directed to a member of the research team to get informed consent when
present at the clinic site or contact [CONTACT_109313].
C. Who will be involved in the process of consent and what are their responsibilities?
For Aim 1, patients who are interested as identified through clinical trial registry will be
contact[CONTACT_426] a member of the research team to review participation in the study and
determine eligibility criteria and if eligible will complete the informed consent process for the
semi-structured focus groups.
In the instance where the participant is identified by [CONTACT_109314] a member of the research team will be
provided to the participant to review any questions they may have pertaining to the consent
prior to starting any survey questions.
[CONTACT_109325] will be consenting BHP's, Clinical Staff, Providers and Administration
D. How much time will be allotted to the process of consent?
The consent process is likely to take between 5-10 minutes. However, more time will be
provided if needed. We will follow up with the BHP, Clinical Staff, Providers and
Administration's manager to determine BHP, Clinical Staff, Providers and Administration
interest and invite those interested in participating to complete the informed consent. BHPs
at the participating clinic site will identify patients who meet the eligibility criteria and
determine interest in participation.
E. How will the process of consent be structured for subjects who are likely to be more
vulnerable to coercion or undue influence?
Informed consent will be completed in the office of the BHP or with UNMC research Team
member on this IRB approved who is identified via clinical trial registry or during their
standard of care appointment. Consent will be completed virtually or in written format for in
person visits, as such, it will be read aloud to participants. Participants will have additional
time, if needed, for delayed consent and encouraged to discuss their participation with
family/friends. Only Citi trained and UNMC IRB approved members of this IRB application
will be performing consent.

F. Will non-English speaking subjects be enrolled in this research?
No
Provide justification for exclusion of non-English speaking subjects
Because of limited funding, we will focus on recruiting English speaking subjects only. When
we expand the study in the future, we will translate all the materials in Spanish to recruit
Spanish-speaking subjects as well.
G. How will it be determined that the subject/parent(s)/guardian(s)/LAR understood the
information presented?
The participants will be asked about their understanding of the elements of informed
consent prior to determining if the information presented was understood. The BHP and
designated research staff will use open-ended questions to assess if participants
understand what they believe need to do to participate in the study. If they do not
communicate understanding, the study and aspects of their potential participation will be
described to them again.

Yes
B. Have scientifically appropriate preclinical studies, including studies on pregnant
animals, and clinical studies, including studies on non-pregnant women, been
conducted?
No
C. Do these studies provide data for assessing potential risks to pregnant women and
fetuses?
No
2. Risks and Benefits to the Pregnant Woman or Fetus which are Associated
with the Research [45 CFR 46.204(B)] 
A. Is there any prospect  of direct benefit for the woman or the fetus?
No
1) Describe any risks to the fetus.
Pregnant women are not being exclusively targeted for this research but they may be a
part of the data and are not being specifically excluded as they may also suffer from mental
illnesses. As the study involves the use of mobile apps in addition to surveys and
semi-structured interviews for primary data collection, there is no research-based risk to the
fetus or the woman herself.
2) Describe how the research could lead to the development of important biomedical
knowledge.
Version 14 - PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page [ADDRESS_121193] (IRB)
IRB PROTOCOL # 0178-21-EP   Page 43 of 44
Our results will directly inform how technology-based strategies may improve trauma-
focused care for underserved populations and shape procedures for a larger clinical trial
that may be conducted with the fully- developed and refined educational materials and
procedures based on analyses from these data.
3) Could the research be conducted without involvement of pregnant women?
Yes
3. Minimization of Risks to the Pregnant Woman and Fetus [45 CFR 46.204(C)]

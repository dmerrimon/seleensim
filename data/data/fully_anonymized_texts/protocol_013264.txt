[ADDRESS_606909] frequently cited danger signs of heart failure (HF) are new onset o r worsening of 
fatigue, dyspnea and edema. In previous research, patients did not recognize worsening HF, due 
to 3 primary reasons: (1) danger signs  were non -specific and misinterpreted as stress, an external 
force or another comorbidity, (2) danger signs were unrecognized due to the subtle nature of 
worsening status, or (3) when patients eliminated or minimized activities that prompted danger 
signs, they interpreted the results as improvement in status.  Lack of recognition of HF danger 
signs and lack of understanding of how to control and minimize danger signs  could lead to their 
escalation and prompt all-cause and HF -related health care resource utilization ( HCRU:   
emergency department care, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , death/ ventricular assist device /cardiac 
transplantation referral or placement, or an unscheduled/urgent office visit). During 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], patient education is delivered, but it is assumed that patients understand the 
danger  signs and simply need education in self -care behavior expectations. We hypothesize that 
patients must understand HF danger signs to have self -confidence in recognizing them and in 
taking steps to minimize or eliminate their occurrence post hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Therefore, the 
purpose s of this randomized, controlled trial are to determine  if video education in HF danger 
signs recognition and control prior to discharge and post -discharge reduce s all-cause and HF -
related [ADDRESS_606910] -discharge. The primary end -point is 30 -day HF -
related HCRU.  A total of 732 patients ( 658 + 10% attrition) with decompensated HF will be 
enrolled . Patients will be followed by [CONTACT_473692][INVESTIGATOR_059].

 INTRODUCTION     
 
Chronic h eart failure (HF) is a cost ly diagnosis ;[ADDRESS_606912].2  
 
Adherence to HF self-care maintenance (carrying out HF self -care behaviors recommended to 
patients with most etiologies of HF: limiting sodium intake per day, being active and exercising, 
managing fluids by [CONTACT_473693] , monitoring for signs and 
symptoms of worsening HF, taking medications as ordered, and receiving follow -up care early 
after discharge) and management (calling a healthcare provider for new or worsening symptoms 
or taking actions to reduce sodium or fluid inta ke) behaviors w ere associated  with improved 
clinical outcomes, including survival and fewer rehosptializations.3-5 Of note, when researchers 
studied 4 self -care behaviors in 830 patients with HF (weight monitoring, low sodium diet, fluid 
restriction and activity) at 30 days after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], only 48% were adherent . At 18 
months, all -cause mortality or HF  rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_473669] 4 behaviors versus 0 or 1, 2, or 3 behaviors.4  
 
Patients with HF may not employ self -care behavior expectations when they do not understand 
HF danger signs (specifically: dyspnea, fatigue and edema) or understand how HF self -care 
behaviors can reduce or eliminate HF danger sign s. Patients with HF may not understand that 
eliminating behaviors that lead to worsening of dyspnea and/or fatigue d oes not eliminate their 
risk of worsening HF . Rather, elimination of activities that worsened dyspnea and/or fatigue may 
simply mask worsening status, as the patient no longer experiences these symptoms. If patients 
recognize dyspnea, fatigue and edema as danger signs of worsening HF, they could employ self-
care behaviors that might minimize/reduce  worsening status and create equilibrium.  
 
Dyspnea, fatigue and edema are common  in patients with HF. In 2 reports, nearly all patients 
reported dyspnea during decompensation,6,7 and even when in ambulatory care,6 and edema  was 
present in over two -thirds of those assessed. 6,7 The symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue were often 
related to one another in previous research studies (r=0.408 and 0.43,9 respectively).  Further, 
patients’ responses to worsening symptoms were often to go to an emergency dep artment (92% 
of 87 subjects)7 rather than to “do somethi ng” actively at home. In fact, very few called their 
doctor (17%; n=14)  and of those, even fewer reached their doctor (6%, n=5). More patients 
waited for their next doctor’s appointment (30%, n=25).7 When patients were asked about self -
management, very few reduced salt intake (11%, n=9) or increased diuretic doses (10%, n=8), 
but elevating legs was more common (48%, n=40).7  Of note, patients took actions that would 
not be considered evidence -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_473670]; for example, patients drank more water 
(19%, n=16), took medications other than what was prescribed (16%, n=13) and reduced activity 
level (77%, n=64).[ADDRESS_606913] these danger signs with HF,10 
especially if they believe dyspnea, fatigue and edema are associated with external forces (stress, 
too much activity/not enough rest, pneumonia, chronic lung disease, anemia, worsening kidney 
[ADDRESS_606914] -03657459  
V2_11-07-18  
 dysfunction , peripheral vascular disease, etc. ), or if they believe there is no way to control these 
danger signs. In one report, of 571 patients who were assessed for understanding of HF signs and 
symptoms, only 38.7% had complete understanding, and of those with less than complete 
understanding, 22.1% had poor understanding.[ADDRESS_606915] common danger signs of decompensation  or 
worsening condition  (even if they believe they still feel fine),  and also to provide simple, 
practical action s to reduce danger signs and restore equilibrium  when recognized .  
 
Media Design.   In the mid -1950s, Stanford University professor Albert Bandura began to 
explore and establish the principles of behavioral modeling : that people learn to enact behavioral 
skills best by [CONTACT_473694]. Over the next 
half century, thousands of experimental and field studies in refereed journal articles and the 
medical literature have identified and supported Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory  principles 
for effecting positive behavior change.13  
 
The power of modeling for behavior change was also found to be effective via media delivery – 
film, video, even photographic stills, called symbolic modeling  – as long as the depi[INVESTIGATOR_473671] s ocial cognitive theory 
principles.14  
 
Wellflix behavioral -modeling videos  address one weak  link in the HF admission  / intervention / 
recovery process: what happens after  patients with HF have returned home and  are no longer in  a 
controlled clinical environment . The Wellflix behavioral design, informed by [CONTACT_473695],  depi[INVESTIGATOR_473672]-home self -care behaviors that  are aimed at maintaining heart health,  
such as recognizing danger signs and taking appropriate non -pharmacological actions to 
minimize them .  
 
Given that social cognitive theory principles can be successful in meeting outcomes when using 
media delivery and that new technologies enable easy accessibility to video in homes via digital 
video disc ( DVD ) player, computer and smartphone, this research endeavors to assess the 
effectiveness of symbolic modeling to promote positive heart health outcomes.  Video delivery  – 
via online and DVD – provides a 24/7 way for patients and family supporters to know how to 
recognize and respond to new or worsening dysp nea, fatigue and edema  danger signs . The 
stimulus materials, designed by [CONTACT_38788] (the Principal Investigator ) and Wellflix Inc,  are not one-
size-fits-all informational videos. Each video is tailored to an individual patient’s gender, 
ethnicity, and language – one of  the more than two dozen social cognitive theory design 
principles built into each video .  
 
It is unknown if in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473673]  (with repeat viewing post -discharge as desired) that 
uses symbolic modeling and is aimed at enhancing recognition of and HF self-care response  
action s to new or worsening dyspnea, fatigue and edema danger signs , (a) reduces all -cause and 
HF-related healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) , (b) improves perceptions of dyspnea and 
fatigue , and (c) improves self-efficacy for managing symptoms . Learning the HCRU effects of 
[ADDRESS_606916] common HF danger signs (dyspnea, 
fatigue and edema ) and provides practical actions  to reduce danger signs is important, as the 
intervention is easy to deploy , uses standard HF self -care behavior expectations,  and is practical 
to use in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473674].  
 
It is important to learn the time to the video intervention  effect  on (a) HCRU outcomes and (b) 
perceptions of fatigue, dyspnea and self -efficacy for managing HF symptoms . The  intervention 
may have an early effect (30-days)  that wanes over time, have a steady effect over a [ADDRESS_606917] may be slow to peak (i.e., 90 or 180 days) as patients may learn through a 
recognition and self -care action “ trial and error ” approach .  
 
Finally, the video intervention effect on outcomes may differ based on after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473675]/or family supporters , as repeated viewing and/or family supporter 
viewing of danger signs and HF self -care actions may facilitate earlier re cognition  of warning 
signs a nd/or earlier or more accurate adherence to HF self-care actions that lead to improved 
HCRU outcomes, lower perceptions of fatigue and dyspnea and improved self -efficacy for 
managing symptoms.     
 
Study Purposes  
The purposes of this study are to examine  the effects of HF danger signs video s (1 each on 
dyspnea, fatigue and edema) that include 2 key features: (1) recognition of each danger sign and 
(2) common, simple, practical self -are action s known to reduce  HF danger signs  ([a] fatigue: 
recognizing that it may be due to dehydration and adhering to physical activity and exercise 
expectations; [b] dyspnea and edema: adhering to a low sodium diet and fluid intake limitations; 
[c] all 3: contact[CONTACT_30697] a doctor when appro priate) . Based on Bandura’s social cognitive theory 
symbolic modeling, v ideo content is meant to increase self -efficacy for independently 
completing self -care actions when dyspnea, fatigue and/or edema are present.

Specific aims and hypotheses : 
1.   Determine the effects (and time to effects) of HF danger signs education on first occurrence , 
time to first  occurrence  and total all-cause and HF -related HCRU after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]:  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , ED visit , death , cardiac transplantation  or VAD . 
2.  Examine if functional status, dyspnea , fatigue  and self -efficacy for managing symptoms  
scores change over time and the direction of change . 
3.  Among intervention group participants, determine if post -discharge re -viewing of danger

Hypothesis 1a : 30-day post -discharge HCRU  will be lower or trend toward lower , and [ADDRESS_606926] occurrence , and total HCRU will be lower in the HF video danger education 
group compared to the usual care  group .  
 
Hypothesis 1 b: Time to first HCRU occurrence  will be longer at 30 -, 90- and 180 -days in the HF 
video danger education group compared to the usual care group . 
 
Hypothesis 1 c: Total  HCRU will be lower at 30 -, 90- and 180 -days in the HF video danger 
education group compared to the usual care group.  
 
Hypothesis 2a: Functional status scores improve at 30 -days and remain lower over time in the 
HF video danger education group compared to the usual care group.

danger education group compared to the usual care group.  
 
Hypothesis 2c: Fatigue scores improve at 30 -days and remain lower over time in the HF video 
danger education group compared to the usual care group.  
 
Hypothesis 2d: Self-efficacy for managing symptoms  scores are higher at [ADDRESS_606927] -03657459  
V2_11-07-18  
 Hypothesis 3a: Repeat viewing of  videos by [CONTACT_1962] , compared to 1 -time viewing  in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473676]/or v iewing of  videos by [CONTACT_473697] /caregivers in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/or post discharge , 
compared to viewing only by [CONTACT_473698].  
 
Hypothesis 3 b: Repeat viewing of  videos by [CONTACT_1962] , compared to 1 -time viewing  in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473676]/or v iewing of  videos by [CONTACT_473697] /caregivers in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/or post discharge , 
compared to viewing only by [CONTACT_473699]  (due to heighten ed awareness of danger signs, heighten ed 
recognition of worsening of danger signs ) 
 
Hypothesis 3 c: Repeat viewing of  videos by [CONTACT_1962] , compared to 1 -time viewing  in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473676]/or v iewing of  videos by [CONTACT_473697] /caregivers  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/or post discharge , 
compared to viewing only by [CONTACT_1962], will be associated with  higher self-efficacy for HF 
self-care actions  (due to symbolic modeling of self -care actions)  
  
METHODS  
Design:  The study will use a  2-group, randomized , placebo -controlled , single blinded,  design. 
Healthcare providers and unit nurses will be blinded to group assignment, but may learn about 
HF danger signs education if they enter the patients’ room during intervention delivery or discuss 
the intervention prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].    
 
In brief, the research intervention involves 3  novel  short video s (fatigue, dyspnea and edema)  
that will be viewed back -to-back by [CONTACT_473700] a DVD player . Wellflix, 
Inc. videos are  research -informed , use behavioral -modeling , are personally -tailored and are 
available 24/7 online . Patients will receive a handout sheet with the web address to view the 
videos after discharge and will be encouraged to view them with family members.     
 
Sample (including sample size calculation) and Setting  
A total of 732 patients will be enrolled (366 per group) and consist of adults  with chronic HF  
(diagnosis ≥ 2 months) who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473677] s. This sample size includes a 10% attrition rate. Sample size was based on power 
calculations using [ADDRESS_606928] occurrence of HF -related HCRU (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency 
department visit, mortality, cardiac transplantation or VAD). The current expected 30 -day HF -
related readmission rate is 20% among the control group. Allowing for other HCRU 
components, a control group HCRU rate of 28% is expected at 30 days. At 90 days, HCRU rate 
of 46% is expected in the control group. Sample size calculations were perform ed using SAS 
software (version 9.4; Cary, NC) and assume use of two -sided Pearson –chi square tests.  With 
329 patients in each group there will be 80% power to detect a 33% relative decrease (9.2% 
absolute decrease) in first occurrence of HF -related HCRU from a HCRU rate of 28% in the 
control group. With this sample size there would also be 85% power to detect a relative decrease 
of 25% (absolute decrease of 11.5%) from a control group event rate of 46% at 90 -days. 
Allowing for 10% loss to follow -up, we wi ll enroll 366 patients per group (732 total).

Intervention  
The fatigue and dyspnea video’s will be viewed back -to-back  and the edema video will be added 
for patients with a history of edema. There are 4 versions of each video: (1) based on  race 
(Caucasian and African -American) and sex (male and female) —to promote symbolic 
modeling — by [CONTACT_473701]  (as stated in the introduction) . Scripts for 
each video w ere developed jointly by [CONTACT_473702], PhD, Director of Media and Education for 
Wellflix, Inc. and Nancy Albert PhD, principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_473680] . 
Content includes recognition and assessment of fatigue, dyspnea and edema a nd specific actions 
to take to reduce the danger signs  or prevent wors ening (dietary sodium and/or fluid restriction , 
physical activity/exercise  and contact[CONTACT_473703] ).  
 
Overall v ideo viewing time for all 3 videos is 9:50 minutes ; the fatigue and dyspnea videos that 
all intervention patients will view are 6:50 minutes :  
• Fatigue  is 2:20 minutes + end text list=  3:00 minutes;  
[ADDRESS_606930] -03657459  
V2_11-07-18  
 • Dypsnea  is 1:40 minutes + dyspnea “yes” or “no” management  (2 options; patient selects  the 
option that matches current status) = 3.50 minutes  
• Edema  is 2:40 minutes + end text list= 3:00 minutes;  
 
During hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , videos will be loaded into an iPAD and will be viewed through the 
iPAD.  
 
Patients have an opportunity to view videos post -discharge as desired and able. Post discharge , 
video s can be in 2 ways: (1) via the Wellflix, Inc. site at www.wellflix.net/DangerSignsCC  or (2) 
by [CONTACT_473704] (DVD created by [CONTACT_473705], Inc for this research) , for patients who have DVD 
player capability and prefer this method .  
 
NOTE, at/after 180 -day follow up data are collected, usual care group  patients will be offered 
access to Wellflix, Inc. vide os used in th is research study  via mailing of a handout sheet 
developed specifically for them  (that contains the web address  and a note of encourage ment to 
view the videos .    
 
Outcomes and Measurement  
HCRU . Includes all-cause and HF -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ED visit, death , cardiac 
transplantation , or VAD  placement at 30 -, 90-, and 180 -days ± 6 days  in both groups. Data will 
be retrieved from medical records when available or via telephone call to patients.  
 
• Patients will receive a calendar to keep track of HCRU events in -between phone calls.  
• Research nurses will use a case report form to record HCRU events  
 
Functional status : The Duke Activity Status Index (DASI )15 developed in a sample of 
people undergoing cardiac exercise testing and now routinely used to assess functional status in 
patients with cardiac disease. The DASI is a 12 -item questionnaire using a Likert -like scale that 
determines a patient’s ability to pa rticipate in common, everyday activities without difficulty, 
including self -care activities (1 item), ambulation (4 items), housework (3 items), yard work (1 
item), sexual relations (1 item), and r ecreational activities (2 items).[ADDRESS_606931] the metabolic equivalent (MET) used during the activity. A total score reflects functional 
status based on responses to each item. Scores can range from 0 (most severe functional 
impairment) to 58.20 (no functional impairm ent). Several investigators have investigated the 
reliability and validity of the DASI .15-18  The internal consistency of the DASI measured by 
[CONTACT_32358]’s alpha has been found to be acceptable in HF patients.[ADDRESS_606932]  reliability also 
was examined and determined to be acceptable in patients with HF .16 The validity of DASI was 
demonstrated in subjects undergoing graded exercise testing wh o demonstrated a high 
correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient from .58 to .80 ) with peak oxygen uptake .[ADDRESS_606933] patient functional capacity in patients with cardiac disease .17 When DASI  results were 
correlated with other functional and health status measures, moderate to strong correlations were 
found: [LOCATION_001] Heart Association ( r, -64; P < 0.001); six minute walk test ( r, 44; P < 0.01);  
Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire physical limitations component ( r, 68; P < 0.001);

 metabolic equivalents calculated from peak treadmill speed and grade ( r, 46; P < 0.01).18  DASI 
will be asse ssed at enrollment and scores will be used as interval level data in analysis.  
 
Dyspnea : The Patient -Reported Outcomes  Measurement Information System ® (PROMIS ®) 
Dyspnea Functional Limitations – Short Form 10a has been used in patients with idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis19 and systemic sclerosis.[ADDRESS_606935] 
7 days. Response options use a Likert -type scale from 0, no difficulty  to 3, much difficulty  and 
there is an option for “ I did not do this in the past 7 days ”.   
 
Fatigue : Fatigue is a hallmark symptom of HF that may decrease energy and reduce the 
patient’s desire to exercise. The Fatigue Assessment Scale  is a 10 -item self -rated measure of 
fatigue with 5 answer categories; 1 = never  to 5 = always , that has been assess in patients with 
end-stage heart failure,21 as well as in patients with stroke and in working adults. In factor 
analysis, this tool correlated strongly with 4 other fatigue scales; however, this tool had the 
highest factor loading on a clear one -factor solution.22  
 
Self-efficacy for managing symptoms . Validation of the PROMIS Self -Efficacy for 
Managing Symptoms forms were completed among 1087 subjects that included patients with 
chronic neurologic conditions (epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], multiple sclerosis, neuropathy, Parkinson disease, and 
stroke) and general chronic conditions  and compared with a traditional self -efficacy measure and 
5 PROMIS short forms that measured physical and mental g lobal health, physical function, 
fatigue, depression, and anxiety.23 Researchers found strong co rrelation between all forms of the 
PROMIS and the traditional self -efficacy measure ( rhos, 0.56 to 75).[ADDRESS_606936] education, comfort living on current household income, current signs and 
symptoms of HF, comorbid conditions and billing data retrieved from Cleveland Clinic billing 
database (age, race, gender, marital statu s, discharge disposition, and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]). 
The Charlson Comorbidity Index  will be used to collect medical comorbidity history . This index 
was developed to classify comorbid conditions which might change the risk of mortality.24-29 The 
score will be categorized into 3 groups (score of 1 -2 = 1; 3 -4 = 3; 5 or more = 5). In one study 
with 33,940 patients with ischemic heart disease, the groupi[INVESTIGATOR_473681] a strong relationship 
with mortality rate.29 In 2011, the tool was reduced from 19 items to  12 items and each item was 
re-scored based on morbidity and mortality of medical conditions in the current era of medical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].30 This data will also be used to describe the sample groups for similarity in acuity.   
   
Video Watching Experiences in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137843] 30 day follow -up (intervention group  
only). A 3 -item, investigator -developed survey will assess video watching characteristics: total 
number of watching’s, caregiver/family member video watching in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , and 
[ADDRESS_606937] -03657459  
V2_11-07-18  
 caregiver/family member video watching in the post discharge  period , up to [ADDRESS_606938]-response options.  
 
Data Collection  
Medical records will be assessed for inclusion an d exclusion criteria before approaching patients.  
Research personnel will explain the study in a patient’s room ( in non -private rooms, a curtain 
will be drawn to s eparat e beds and enhance confidentiality ). After received verbal  informed 
consent, patients will complete baseline data  that includes assessment of functional status, 
dyspnea, fatigue and self -efficacy for managing symptoms immediately before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
Administration of the functional status, dyspnea and fatigue questionnaires will be randomly 
changed for each participant to allow for coun terbalancing, since the re item themes may have 
overlap/be similar . Baseline data collection should take 10 minutes or less.  
 
After completing baseline paperwork , patients will be randomly assigned to the usual care or 
usual care plus HF danger signs video education group using block r andomization ; with  blocks 
of 20, to decrease the influence of external factors that could alter outcomes.  The randomization 
assignment will be made by a QHS statistician .  
 
 
After randomization to groups : 
• Intervention group patients will receive usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473682], HF danger signs 
education via iPad by [CONTACT_2710] . Danger signs e ducation can be administered at the 
time of enrollment . There is no need to wait until day of discharge, since  HF danger sign 
messages are not individualized  and discharge is a very busy time. Immediately p rior to 
discharge, patients’ focus may be on preparing to leave the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473683], especially if patients believe that they have accurate perceptions of HF danger 
signals , even though in previous research, most subjects did not.   
• Usual care group patients will be educated  by [CONTACT_473706] (including 
nurse/other  caregivers ). Education may include Elsevier HF videos that are shown on 
Cleveland Clinic hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473684] .   
 
A research nurse will use telephone call s or mailing methodologies  to have the following 4/5 
tools (40/43 items in total  for usual care and intervention groups, respectively ) completed at 30 ± 
6 days: functional status, dyspnea, fatigue , self-efficacy for managing symptom  and video 
watching experiences . Administration of functional status, dyspnea, and fatigue  questionnaires 
will be randomly ordered (counterbalanced). The intervention -only group survey on video 
watching experiences will be administered last . It is expected that data collection will take ~ 10 
minutes or less.  
 
A research nurse will review EMRs of enrolled patients after the index (baseline) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473685] 30-, 60-, 90- and 180 -days (± 6 days ) for HCRU event s.   
• If not found  in the EMR , telephone call s will be made to gather data.  
• At baseline, research nurses will obtain  home telephone number and the telephone number of 
a close relative or friend that can provide patient contact [CONTACT_3031], as needed.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_606939] occurrence HCRU use ( all-cause and HF -related ) will be compared using 
Pearson chi -square tests. Time to first HFCU use will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier 
estimates, and compared using log -rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models.  Total 
HCRU use will be compared using Poisson regression mode ls. Linear mixed effect models will 
be used to evaluate trends in functional, dyspnea, fatigue, and self -efficacy measures over time 
and, if trends significantly differ, comparisons within time point will be performed.  Secondary 
analyses will use similar methods to compare patients in the video group, stratified by [CONTACT_473707], on the same outcomes. If appropriate, exploratory analyses will also be performed, 
comparing the above outcomes between treatment groups, adjusting for any patient 
characterist ics that dif fer between randomized groups. Analyses will be performed using SAS 
software (version 9.4; Cary, NC), and an overall significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_606940] 
patients who meet exclusion criteria due to enrollment in another research study  or non-
ambulatory NHYHA FC IV (advanced)  HF. Electronic medical record s allow for review of data 
on events that occur in all system hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473686]; 
decreasing the need to rely on patient recall of HCRU .  
 
The HF danger signs videos provide information that patients should understand, but that may 
not have been explicitly explained previously ; therefore, it may be considered an extension of 
usual care education . Ideally, n o new information is presented; as patients receive content about 
HF signs and symptoms and HF self -care actions via CC video education (in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], when 
attentive) and via the HF handbook , which is sent home and can be re -given in ambulatory care . 
Danger signs v ideo content was based on sy mbolic modeling ; and has a repeatable  format , if 
patients in the intervention group choose to utilize the on -line 24/[ADDRESS_606941]  data (at all sites) . The main campus has multiple research 
projects in place , led by [CONTACT_13922], myself and other RNs . Research  team personnel are  
accustomed to work ing with cardiology research nurses , as needed, to ensure patients are not 
approached for more than 1 research study.    
 
Instruments that will be completed at baseline may be s elf- or research nurse -administered  
(patient demographic s, HF characteristics, danger signs [dyspnea and fatigue], functional status 
and self -efficacy for managing symptoms ). The  patient demographics and HF characteristics 
instruments h ave been used many times in previous HF research and are short, simple and quick 
[ADDRESS_606942] -03657459  
V2_11-07-18  
 to complete. Patients may become fatigued when completing baseline data collection forms; 
however, all [ADDRESS_606943] on ly 71 items (in total ) and all tools ar e short (12 or less items ; each 
one should take about 3 minutes to complete ).  
• At baseline, a ll 6 tools should take and take under 20 minutes to complete. In previous 
research, patients  were NOT burden ed by [CONTACT_473708] .  
• At follow -up, telephone call s are only made when HCRU data is not available in medical 
records  at 60 -, 90- and 180 -days. Data obtained from electronic medical records is 
consistently present, minimizing the occurrence of missing data.   
• At [ADDRESS_606944] data on 4 tools  with 40 items in total, that 
will take ~ 1 0 minutes or less to complete  (usual care group) or 5 tools with 43 items in total, 
that will take ~ 10 minutes to complete (intervention group)  and include  functional status, 
dyspnea, fatigue self -efficacy , and  a 3-item video viewing experience survey  for the 
intervention group, by [CONTACT_230861]. As a secondary method, patients who are 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473687] -up period may receive tools in person by a research nurse.    
 
Limitations and Anticipated Problems  
Patients and caregivers may never view the Wellflix, Inc. HF danger sign videos after discharge, 
and/or forget content viewed during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . Patients may view/hear , but ignore, message 
content. Patients may drop out before  the 180 -day follow -up data collection . Analyses will be 
completed using “ intent to treat ” methods . In this way, we will be able to learn the effect size of 
the intervention among all patients randomized to the intervention group.   
 
No adverse effects are anticipated, as the i ntervention in this research are HF danger signs videos 
that cannot create harm to patients. Video script s provide messages that may be available in 
commercially available videos and or written materials used in usual HF care education and 
discharge instruction materials. There are no risks of adverse events from the intervention  itself .  
 
Human Subjects Protection  
Approval by [CONTACT_473709]. We believe this study is minimal risk as the intervention is composed of back -to-back 
video viewing of 3 HF danger signs (fatigue, dyspnea and edema). Video self -care messages 
delivered through demonstration, imitation and modeling are part of usual heart  failure post -
discharge care , but are delivered using principles of Bandura’s social learning theory, to enhance 
ability to complete independently after vi ewing videos .  
 
One data collection form will use a research number and CCF medical record number; as it will 
also contain names and phone number s; however, all other baseline and follow -up data collection 
forms contain only research number s. Only the research number  will be recorded in the 
electronic database. Paper forms will be kept in a locked cabinet, in a locked office of the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_473688] , after enrollment is completed . Electronic data for analysis will use a research 
number; no patient identifiers will be used. All study results will be reported in aggregate.  
 
[ADDRESS_606945] will be registered in www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Clinical trials evaluating use of pemetrexed in patients with NSCLC and a PS ≥2 are 
limited to a  study by [CONTACT_403909].  that retrospectively  examined pemetrexed  use in 56 
Korean patients with NSCLC and  PS ≥[ADDRESS_1018679] frequent adverse event (28.4%), 
followed by [CONTACT_33234] (23%). Grade 3 -4 hemat ologic toxicity occurred in 8.8% of cases. 
None of the patients required dose modifications due to toxicity.  Non-squamous cell 
carcinoma histology was significantly associated with a superior response rate (P=0.045) 
and disease control rate (P=0.008). The median survival time and the median 
progression free survival (PFS) time were 6.11 month s and 2.17 months, respectively. 
Studies considering advanced age are available, such as the  randomized phase II trial

pemetrexed/gemcitabine in patients with NSCLC and PS of 0 to 2 who were ineligible for 
platinum -based chemotherapy . This study found that  single -agent pemetrexed 
demonstrated moderate activity and was well tolerated , regardless of ad vanced age.13 
Similarly, in a single -arm phase II study of pemetrexed in elderly ( ≥70 years old) 
Japanese patients with advanced non -squamous NSCLC demonstrated favorable 
antitumor activity and mild toxicity.17  In an analysis of two randomized phase III trials

 6.2.3  Performance status  and QOL  
  
ECOG per formance status and QOL will be  assessed at the start of every 
cycle  (i.e. every 3 weeks) . QOL will be assessed by [CONTACT_20368] -
C30 and QLQ -LC13.[ADDRESS_1018697] frequently used QOL 
instrument in lung cancer clinical trials.19 The QLQ -30 is a 30 -item multi -
dimensional questionnaire designed for use in cancer populations.18 It 
contains nine multi -item scales: five functional scales (physical, role, 
cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, 
and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality -of-life scale , 
requested by [ADDRESS_1018698] been shown to be reliable 
and valid in over 60 languages,  can be self - or interviewer -administered 
and take approximately 11 minutes to complete.18, 19 
6.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care 
Guidelines  
 
Patients should receive full supportive care , including transfusions of blood and 
blood products, erythropoietin, antibiotics, antiemetics, etc., as clinically 
indicated . Medications considered necessary for the patient's well -being may be 
given at the discretion of the investigator, i.e., chronic t reatments for concomitant 
medical conditions, as well as agents required for life -threatening medical 
problems, etc. The reason(s) for treatment, dosage, and dates of treatment 
should be recorded on the flow sheets.  
 
6.4 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence  of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may 
continue until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
 Disease progression,  
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 Unacceptable adverse event(s),  including hematologic or nonhematologic 
Grade 3 or 4 toxicity after 2 dose reductions or immediately if Grade 3 or 4 
neurotoxicity is observed  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the  patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
 
A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_744691] [ADDRESS_1018699] University (CCCWFU)  
CCCWFU # [ADDRESS_1018700] . 
Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed 
until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.   
 
Patients will be followed every 6 weeks  until death for monitoring survival study 
endpoints.  
7.0 Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
 
Dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir 
hematologic counts or maximum  nonhematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of 
therapy. Treatment may be delay ed to allow sufficient time for recover y. Upon recovery, 
patients should be retreated using the guidelines in Tables [ADDRESS_1018701] treatment, i.e. a >3 week delay.  
 
Table 1: Dose reduction – Hematologic Toxicities  
Nadir ANC<500 mm3 and nadir platelets ≥50,000/mm3 75% of previous dose  
Nadir platelets <50,000/mm3 without bleeding 
regardless of nadir ANC  75% of previous dose  
Nadir platelets <50,000/mm3 with bleedinga regardless 
of nadir ANC  50% of previous dose  
aThese criteria meet the CTC version 2.0 (NCI 1998) definition of ≥CTC Grade 2 bleeding  
 
If patients develop non -hematologic toxicities (excluding neurotoxicity) ≥Grade 3, 
treatment should be withheld until  resolution to less than or equal to the patient’s pre -
therapy value. Treatment should be resumed according to guidelines in  Table 2.  Patients 
should discontinue therapy if Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity is experienced.

investigation. For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated for 
response every  6 weeks  (+/- 2 weeks) . In addition to a baseline scan, 
confirmatory scans should also be obtained 6 weeks  (+/- 2 weeks) following initial 
documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Sol id Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1.20 
8.1.1 Definitions  
   
 Evaluable for toxicity : All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the 
time of their first treatment with pemetrexed  
 Inevaluable for objective response : When no imaging/measurement is 
done at all  at a particular time point, the patient is not  evaluable (NE) at 
that time point.  
o If only a subset of lesion measurements are  made at an 
assessment, usually the case is  also considered NE at that time 
point, unless  a convincing argument can be made that the  
contribution of the individual missing lesion(s)  would not change 
the assigned time point  response. This would most likely happen 
in the case of PD.  
 Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one  dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of  measurement is to be recorded) with a  minimum size of:   
o [ADDRESS_1018704] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 
mm; when CT scans have  slice thickness >5 mm, the minimum 
size shoul d be twice the slice thickness);  
o 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_40133] (lesions which 
cannot be accurately  measured with calipers should be recorded  
as non -measurable).  
o [ADDRESS_1018705] X -ray. 
 Measurable lesions:  
o Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged  
and measurable, a lymph node must be  ≥[ADDRESS_1018706] scan (CT scan slice thickness is  
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in 
follow -up, only the short  axis will be measured and followed.  
o Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic  lesions with identifiable 
soft tissue  compon ents that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_744699]  
A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_744691] [ADDRESS_1018707] University (CCCWFU)  
CCCWFU # [ADDRESS_1018708] or  MRI can be considered 
measurable if the  soft tissue component meets the definition  of 
measurability described above.  
o ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic  metastases can b e 
considered measurable  if they meet the definition of measurability  
described above. However, if non -cystic  lesions are present in the 
same patient,  these are preferred for selection as  target lesions.  
 Non-measurable lesions : Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions,  
including small lesions (longest diameter  <10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with  10 to <15 mm short axis), as well as truly  non-measurable 
lesions. Lesions considered  truly non -measurable include: 
leptomeningeal  disease, ascites, pleura l or pericardial effusion,  
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic  involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal  masses/abdominal organomegaly identified  by [CONTACT_744700].  
o Lesions with prior local treatment, such  as those situated in a 
previously irradiated  area or in an area subjected to other  loco-
regional therapy, are usually not  considered measurable unless 
there has  been demonstrated progression in the  lesion.  
 Target lesions : All measurable le sions up to a maximum  of two lesions 
per organ and five lesions in  total, representative of all involved organs,  
should be identified as target lesions and recorded  and measured at 
baseline.  
o Target lesions should be selected on the  basis of their size 
(lesions with the longest  diameter) and be representative of all  
involved organs, as well as their suitability  for reproducible 
repeated measurements.  
o All measurements should be recorded in  metric notation using 
calipers if clinically  assessed.  
o A sum of the di ameters (longest for non -nodal  lesions, short axis 
for nodal lesions) for all  target lesions will be calculated and 
reported  as the baseline sum diameters, which will be  used as 
reference to further characterize any  objective tumor regressio n in 
the measur able dimension of the disease. If lymph nodes  are to 
be included in the sum, only the  short axis will contribute.  
o Lymph nodes identified as target lesions  should always have the 
actual short axis  measurement recorded even if the nodes  regress 
to below 10 m m on study. When  lymph nodes are included as 
target lesions,  the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even  if 
complete response criteria are met since  a normal lymph node is 
defined as having  a short axis of <10 mm.  
o Target lesions that become ‘too small to  measure’:  While on 
study, all lesions (nodal  and non -nodal) recorded at baseline 
should  have their actual measurements recorded  at each 
subsequent evaluation, even when  very small. However, 
sometimes lesions or  lymph nodes become so faint on a CT scan  
that the radiologist may not feel comfortable  assigning an exact

 measure and may report  them as being ‘too small to measure’, in  
which case a default value of 5 mm should  be assigned.  
o Lesions that  split or coalesce on treatment: When non -nodal 
lesions ‘fragme nt’, the longest diameters of the fragmented  
portions should be added together to  calculate the target lesion 
sum. Similarly,  as lesions coalesce, a plane between  them may be 
maintained that would aid in  obtaining maximal diameter 
measurements  of each indi vidual lesion. If the lesions  have truly 
coalesced such that they are  no longer separable, the v ector of 
the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal 
longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
 Non-target lesions: All lesions (or sites of d isease) not identified  as target 
lesions, including pathological lymph  nodes and all non -measurable 
lesions, should  be identified as non -target lesions and be  recorded at 
baseline. Measurements of these  lesions are not required and they 
should be  followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’ or in rare cases,  ‘unequivocal 
progression’.  
8.1.2  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
  
The same me thod of assessment and the same technique should be 
used to characterize each  identified and repo rted lesion at baseline and 
during follow -up. 
 
 CT is the best currently available and reprod ucible method to measure 
lesions selected for response assessment. MRI  is also acceptable in 
certain situations  (e.g., for body scans but not for lung).  
 Lesions on a chest X -ray may be considered  measurable lesions if they 
are clearly  defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is 
preferable.  
 Clinical lesions will only be considered  measurable when they are 
superficial and  ≥10 mm in diameter as assessed using  calipers. For the 
case of skin lesions,  documentation by [CONTACT_6775],  including a 
ruler to estimate the size of  the lesion, is recommended.  
 Ultrasound (US) should not be used to  measure tumor lesions.  
 Tumor markers alone cannot be used to  assess res ponse. If markers are 
initially  above the upper normal limit, they must  normalize for a patient to 
be considered in  complete response.  
 Cytology and histology can be used in rare  cases (e.g., for evaluation of 
residual  masses to differentiate between Partial  Response and Complete 
Response or  evaluation of new or enlarging effusions to  differentiate 
between Progressive Disease  and Response/Stable Disease).  
 Use of endoscopy and laparoscopy is not  advised. However, they can be 
used to  confirm complete pathological response.

 8.1.3  Response Criteria  
 
 Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions . Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm  
 Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% d ecrease in the sum of diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters  
 Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of 
diameters  of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study 
(this may inclu de the baseline sum). The sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD . 
8.1.4  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
 Complete Response ( CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and  
normalization  of tumor marker levels. All  lymph nodes must be non -
pathological in  size (<10 mm short axis).  
 Non-CR / Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target  lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker  levels above normal limits.  
 Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target  
lesions.  
o When  patient has measurable disease: To achieve ‘unequivocal 
progression’ on the basis of the non -target disease, there must  be an 
overal l level of substantial worsening in non -target disease such that, 
even in  presence of SD or PR in target disease,  the overall tumor 
burden has increased  sufficiently to merit discontinuation of  therapy. A 
modest ‘increase’ in the size  of one or more non -target lesions is  
usually not sufficient to qualify for  unequivocal progression status.  
o When patient has only non -measurable  disease: There is no 
measurable disease  assessment to factor into the interpretation  of an 
increase in non -measurable disease  burden. Because worsening in 
non-target  disease cannot be easily quantified, a useful  test that can 
be applied is to consider if the  increase in overall disease burden 
based  on change in non -measurable disease is  comparable in 
magnitude to the increase  that would be required to declare PD for  
measurable disease. Examples include an  increase in a pleural 
effusion from ‘trace’  to ‘large’ or an increase in lymphangitic  disease 
from localized to widespread.  
 New lesions : The appearance of new malignant lesions  denotes d isease 
progression.  
o The finding of a new lesion should be  unequivocal (i.e., not 
attributable to  differences in scanning technique, change  in imaging 
modality or findings thought  to represent something other than tumor,  
especially when the patient’s baseli ne lesions show partial or 
complete response).

(particularly  possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the  basis of 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified  according to the following 
algorithm:  
 Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET a t 
follow -up is PD based on a new lesion.  
 No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive  FDG -PET at follow -
up: 
 If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
new site of disease  confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  
 If the positiv e FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed 
as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up CT 
scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD 
will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan) . 
 If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of  disease on CT that is not 
progressing  on the basis of the anatomic  images, this 
is not PD.

8.1.6  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of over all response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first 
recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest  
measurements recorded on study).  
 
The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease 
is objectively documented.

9.3 STRC  SAE Reporting Requirements  
 
The Safety and Toxicity Reporting Committee (STRC) is responsible for reviewing SAEs 
for CCCWFU Institutional studies as outlined in Appendix B. STRC  currently requires 
that all unexpected 4 and  all grade  5 SAEs on these trials be reported to them for 
review. All CCCWFU Clinical Research Management (CRM) s taff members assisting a 
Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_380210], documenting and reporting an SAE qualifying for 
STRC  reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the STRC as well as 
the entir e committee via the email notification procedure of the occurrence of an SAE.  
9.4  WFUHS IRB AE Reporting Requirements  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and adverse events 
shall be promptly reported to the IRB , according to  institutional policy . Reporting to the 
IRB is required regardless of the funding source, study sponsor, or whether the event 
involves an investigational or marketed drug, biologic or device. Reportable events are 
not limited to physical injury, but includ e psychological, economic and social harm.  
Reportable events may arise as a result of drugs, biological agents, devices, procedures 
or other interventions, or as a result of questionnaires, surveys, observations or other 
interactions with research subjects . 
 
All members of the research team are responsible for the appropriate reporting to the 
IRB and other applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or 
others. The Principal Investigator, however, is ultimately responsible for ens uring the 
prompt reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others to the 
IRB. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_744693] t o determine 
whether the report represents a change in the risks and/or benefits to study participants, 
and whether any changes in the informed consent, protocol or other study -related 
documents are required.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to s ubjects or others occurring at a site 
where the study has been approved by [CONTACT_399338] (internal events) must be 
reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or other members 
of the study team becoming aware of the event.  
 
Any una nticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at another site 
conducting the same study that has been approved by [CONTACT_399338] (external 
events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within [ADDRESS_1018718] University (CCCWFU)

administered in this study can be found in Section  9.1. 
10.1 Pharmaceutical Accountability  
 
This drug is commercially available.  
10.2 ALIMTA (Pemetrexed)   
  
Product description :  Pemetrexed disodium heptahydrate has the chemical 
name L -Glutamic acid, N-[4-[2-(2-amino -4,7-dihydro -4-oxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3 -
d]pyrimidin -5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl] -, disodium salt, heptahydrate. It is marketed by 
[CONTACT_296580], LLC. ALIMTA is supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder for 
intravenous infusion available in single -dose vials. The product is a white to 
either light yellow or gre en-yellow lyophilized solid. Each 100 -mg or 500 -mg vial 
of ALIMTA contains pemetrexed disodium equivalent to 100 mg pemetrexed and 
106 mg mannitol or 500 mg pemetrexed and 500 mg mannitol, respectively. 
Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have be en added to adjust pH.  
 
Solution preparation : Reconstitute each 500 -mg vial with 20 mL of 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative free). Reconstitution gives a solution 
containing 25 mg/mL ALIMTA. Gently swirl each vial until the powder is 
completely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear and ranges in color from 
colorless to yellow or green -yellow without adversely affecting product quality. 
The pH of the reconstituted ALIMTA solution is between 6.[ADDRESS_1018720] be 
further diluted into a solution  of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative 
free), so that the total volume of solution is 100 ml.  Reconstitution and further 
dilution prior to intravenous infusion is only recomm ende d with 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection (preservative free). ALIMTA is physically incompatible with 
diluents containing calcium, including Lactated  Ringer’s Injection, USP and 
Ringer’s Injection, USP and therefore these should not be used. 
Coadministration o f ALIMTA  with other drugs and diluents has not been studied, 
and therefore is not recommended.  
 
Storage requirements  and Stability : Chemical and physical stability of 
reconstituted and i nfusion solutions of ALIMTA have been  demonstrated for up to  
24 hours following initial reconstitution, when stored refrigerated. When prepared 
as directed, reconstitution and infusion solutions of ALIMTA contain no 
antimicrobial preservatives. Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15 -
30°C (59 -86°F) . Discard any unus ed portion.

 Route of administration:   ALIMTA is administered as an intravenous infusion 
over [ADDRESS_1018722] polyvinyl chloride (PVC) administration sets and 
intravenous solution bags.  ALIMTA is not a vesicant. There is no specific antidote 
for extravasation of ALIMTA. To date, there have been few  reported cases of 
ALIMTA extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by [CONTACT_093]. 
ALIMTA extravasation  should be managed with local standard practice for 
extravasation as with other non -vesicants.  
 
Drug interactions:  
Non-Steroidal Anti -Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)  
Although ibuprofen (400 mg four times a day) can decrease t he clearance of 
pemetrexed, it can be administered with ALIMTA in patients with normal renal 
function (creatinine clearance ≥80 mL/min). No dose adjustment of ALIMTA is 
needed with concomitant NSAIDs in pati ents with normal renal function.  Caution 
should b e used when administering NSAIDs concurrently with ALIMTA to 
patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 
79 mL/min).  NSAIDs with short elimination half -lives (e.g., diclofenac, 
indomethacin) should be avoided for a p eriod of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 
days following administration of ALIMTA.  In the absence of data regarding 
potential interaction between ALIMTA and NSAIDs with longer half -lives (e.g.,  
meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should in terrupt dosing 
for at least [ADDRESS_1018723] ration  of 
substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g., probenecid) could potentially 
result in delayed clearance of ALIMTA.  
 
Disposal:   Unused por tions of agent should be  disposed of in accordance with 
general anticancer agent guidelines

12.0 Statistical Considerations  
12.1 Analysis of Primary Objective s 
 
There are two primary objectives in this study: 1) To evaluate the effect of single 
agent pemetrexed on tumor progression in ECOG Performance Status 3 patients 
with Stage IV non -squamous histology non -small cell lung cancer  and 2) To 
evaluate the effect of single agent pemetrexed on quality of life in ECOG 
Performance Status [ADDRESS_1018725] a worse prognosis  since their ECOG performance  status 
is 3 whereas the patients in the references had better ECOG performance status.  
Therefore, one goal of this trial is to see whether the re is evidence that the  median 
progression free survival time in this group of treated patients could be  12 weeks 
(i.e., 2.8 months) .   In order to do this we will determine whether each patient has a  
progression  (or dies)  before or after [ADDRESS_1018726] a 95% exact 
(Clopper Pearson) confidence interval around the proportion with PFS greater than 
or equal to 12 weeks .  If this confidence interval includes 50% then that would 
provide e vidence that the therapy is potentially promising.  However, if the upper 
bound of the confidence interval does not include 50% then this would indicate that 
the treatment may not be promising for patients  since we could rule out the 
possibility that the m edian PFS is [ADDRESS_1018727] a progression  (or dies)  at 12 
weeks  (30%) then the upper bound of a 2 -sided 95% confidence interval would not 
include 50%, however if 10 or more patients (out of 30)  do not  have progression  (or 
dies)  at 12 weeks  then the upper bound would include 50% suggesting that the 
treatment is promisi ng.   
 
 
A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_744691] [ADDRESS_1018728] University (CCCWFU)  
CCCWFU # [ADDRESS_1018729] a 12 week 
measure, but we will assess QOL at each treatment time (i.e. every three weeks) 
we can use a longitu dinal mixed models analysis to look at QOL over the time 
course.   This approach would handle missing data if the data is missing at random, 
which means that measured covariates can be used to predict whether missing 
data will occur.   We believe that it i s possible that patients who have worse 
baseline co -morbid conditions may be more likely to have a [ADDRESS_1018730] to s ee if the average 
change is more than 0 (worsening) versus a two-sided alternative that the 
difference is 0 or better.  
 
It should be noted that since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], there is a possibility that one of the 
two primary comparisons (confidence interval  calculation and QOL change) may 
not meet the criteria for success, however if there is evidence that the effects are 
trending in the correct direction (i..e, if the average change in 12 week QOL is 0 or 
positive (implying some improvement) ) then this woul d provide evidence that the 
treatment regimen is possibly working and could possibly warrant further studies.   
12.2 Analysis of Secondary Objective s 
 
There are three secondary objectives in this protocol 1) to evaluate the toxicities 
associated with single agent pemetrexed on tumor progression in ECOG 
Performance Status 3 patients with Stage IV non -squamous histology non -small 
cell lung cancer  (in particular we will examine neutropenia, thrombocytopenia 
and fatigue (although fatigue will also be captured as par t of quality of life 
assessment) , 2) to estimate the res ponse rate in ECOG Performance Status 3 
patients with Stage IV non -squamous histology non -small cell lung cancer 
receiving single agent pemetrexed and  3) to estimate the o verall survival in 
ECOG Perfo rmance Status [ADDRESS_1018731] University (CCCWFU)  
CCCWFU # [ADDRESS_1018732] of determ ining what proportion 
of patients are  progression -free (and alive) at 12 weeks  (yes/no).   With a total of 
30 patients, a two -sided 95% confidence interval (using the Clopper -Pearson 
exact calculation) will have a maximum width of 0.374 (i.e., +/ - 0.187).  Thus, if 
the observed proportion of patients who are progression free at 12 weeks  is 50% 
then the lower bound of this interval will rule out 31.3% (or lower).   Likewise, if 
30% or fewer patients are progression free at 12 weeks  then the upper bound of 
this confidence interval will rule out 50% and thus suggest that the median 
progression free survival for this treatment is less than [ADDRESS_1018733] a response (i..e progress by 12 weeks ) then we will stop 
the trial since the upper bound of a 2 -sided 99% exact confidence interval would 
rule out 50%.  
 
Likewise, with [ADDRESS_1018734] 80% power to detect a change in 
QOL equal to 0.[ADDRESS_1018735] with alpha=0.05 ([ADDRESS_1018736]).  
 
As stated above, since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], it is possible that we may not observe 
statistical significance for  these two aims, however if the point estimates for these 
aims are in the correct direction this will provide evidence that the therapy may 
be a promising alternative for patients and thus warrant further investigation.  If 
this were to occur, the data fro m this trial would be used to provide preliminary 
estimates of what PFS rates may be expected and what change in QOL may be 
expected in a larger efficacy study.

 Appendix C – Mandatory STRC SAE Reporting Guidelines  
 
Mandatory Safety and Toxicity Review Committee ( STRC; Previously CROC)  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Notification Procedure  
 
Mandatory STRC SAE Reporting Requirements – Revised 6/05/2012  
 
This document describes STRC reporting and use of the electronic submission form that is 
submitted for unexpected grade 4 and any grade 5 (death during protocol intervention) 
SAEs on CCCWFU Institutional interventional tri al patients . There are multiple entities that 
require reporting of SAEs. Each entity has different rules for what is reported, and how it is 
reported.  
 
Rules used by [CONTACT_485230] (Institutional Review Board (IRB), AdEERS, MedWatch, etc.) 
should NOT be u sed to evaluate whether an event should be reported to STRC. Only the rules 
for reporting described in this document should be considered.  
 
As defined in the NCI summary IV reporting guidelines, CCCWFU Institutional studies 
covered by [CONTACT_744701]: In-house, internally reviewed 
trials, including those collaborative studies conducted with industry sponsorship in 
which the center is a primary contributor to the design, implementation, and monitoring 
of the trial, or participatio n in a multi -site trial initiated by [CONTACT_485231].   Institutional trials are almost  always authored by a researcher here at 
CCCWFU. Institutional protocols are labeled NCI  Code=”I” for Institutional on the protocol 
screen in ORIS. Cooperative group protocols are not considered Institutional, but Research 
Base trials are classified as Institutional.  
 
The STRC  is responsible for reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional studies , as defined 
above. STRC currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on these trials 
be reported to them for review. All Clinical Research Management (CRM) staff members 
assisting a PI [INVESTIGATOR_744695] a clinical member of the STRC by [CONTACT_648], followed by [CONTACT_744702].  
 
THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO EVERYONE WORKING WITH CANCER 
CENTER INSTITUTIONA L PROTOCOLS.  
 
What is considered an SAE under this mandatory procedure?  
Any unexpected grade 4  event not including routinely experienced events per protocol (e.g. 
myelosuppression) and all grade 5 events  (death during protocol intervention) should be 
repor ted. The patient is considered “on -treatment” as defined in the protocol, which can extend 
days/weeks/months past the last date of actual protocol intervention.

 Table 1: Summary of STRC Reporting Requirements for Institutional Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], Phase 1, Phase [ADDRESS_1018751] be specified in the text of 
the approved protocol.  
 
STRC notification responsibilities of the person handling the reporting/documenting of the 
SAE:  
 
1. Make a phone call to the appropriate clinical member of the STRC as listed below (page if 
necessary) —see note [ADDRESS_1018752] knowledge of the event. This 
form is found at either the ORIS main menu page or by [CONTACT_399351]://ccc.wfubmc.edu/oris/strc.aspx . 
This will ensure that all persons that the event applies to will be notified; remember to file a 
copy of your confirmation. (Form instructions will walk you through the required fields, 
consult the help page for further instructions.)  
3. Ensure that you document that the appropriate persons on the STRC has been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
4. Follow up with/update the clinical member of STRC regarding any new developments or 
information obtained during the course of the SAE investigation and reporting process.  
 
Elements needed to complete the electronic STRC form:  
1. ORIS Patient I D (PID)  
2. Name [CONTACT_485238]/Date/Time/Comments.  
3. Grade of event.  
4. Is this related to protocol intervention or treatment?  
5. Is suspension of the protocol needed?  
6. Is any change to consent or protocol needed?  
7. Was the nature or severity of the event un expected?  
8. Date of the event.  
9. Brief description of the event using approved CTC version terminology.  
A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_744691] [ADDRESS_1018753] University (CCCWFU)  
CCCWFU # [ADDRESS_1018754] study dose before event.  
11. Relevant tests/labs.  
12. Most importantly make sure that the Investigator assigns attribution to the reported 
event (grade) using the appropriate CTCAE version for the protocol.  
 
The Clinical Members of STRC to Notify by [CONTACT_399352]:  
 
 Bayard Powell, MD  – Director -at-Large, CCCWFU; Chair, PRC; Section Head, 
Hematology/Oncology.  6 -7970 / 6 -2701 / Pager 806 -9308  
 Glenn L esser, MD – Hematology Oncology 6 -9527 / 6 -0256 / Pager 806 -8397  
 Kathryn Greven, MD  – Vice Chair – Radiation Oncology. 3 -3600 / Pager 806 -8314  
 Marissa Howard -McNatt, MD  – General Surgery 6 -0545 / 806 -6438  
 
Definition of Unavailable:  As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contact[CONTACT_485233] a reasonable amount of time, then initiate contact [CONTACT_744703].  Give the back -up a reasonable amount of time to respond to a phone call or page before 
contact [CONTACT_485235]. This is a general guideline.  You must use your best judgment as a 
clinical research professional given the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as 
to when it is appropriate to contact [CONTACT_380247].  If the eve nt occurs near the end of day, then 
leave messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting your STRC notification 
form.  The important criteria is that have taken reasonable steps to notify and document that you 
have initiated some type  of contact [CONTACT_672057].  
 
STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY:   It is the responsibility of the STRC clinician to review all 
reported events, evaluate the events as they are reported; and communicate a response to the 
Investigat or, event reporter and the members of STRC. The review will include but not be limited to 
the information reported; there may be times when additional information is needed in order for an 
assessment to be made further communication directly with the inves tigator may be warranted. 
STRC reserves the right to agree with the investigator’s assessment if STRC does not agree with the 
investigator STRC reserves the right to suspend the trial pending further investigation.  
 
AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS REPORTS :  If you are not able to supply all pertinent information 
with the initial submission, once the additional information is available do not submit a new report . 
Go to the original email that was received by [CONTACT_399357] “reply to all” and entitle your email 
“Amen dment for (list date of event and patient ID) this will avoid duplications of the same event. List 
the additional information which you are reporting.

Evaluation of target lesions  
 
   Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions . Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm  
 
   Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter 
(LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
 
   Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started 
or the appearance of one or more new lesions  (this may include the baseline sum). The 
sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
 
   Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qual ify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started  
 
Evaluation of non -target lesions  
 
   Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level . All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size 
(<10 mm short axis).  
 
   Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or/an d 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits . 
 
   Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions . 
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, in such 
circumstances, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13387], and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or study chair).

Evaluation of Best Overall R esponse  
 
The best ove rall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best 
response assig nment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria (see section 9.4.1).

lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm  
 
   Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter 
(LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
 
   Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started 
or the appearance of one or more new lesions  (this may include the baseline sum). The 
sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
 
   Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qual ify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started  
 
Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be cla ssified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression, even after discontinuation of treatment. In some circumstances, it may be difficult 
to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When t he evaluation of complete response 
depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine 
needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status.  
 
 
Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response  
 
Confirmation: confirmatory scans should also be obtained 6 weeks following initial 
documentation of objective response.  
 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the 
first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). The duration of overall CR is m easured from the time measurement 
criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively 
documented.  
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progressio n are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started.

Title: A Single Arm, Open Label, Phase II Study of Ruxolitinib in Sclerotic Chronic Graft -
Versus -Host Disease after Failure of Systemic Glucocortico ids 
Chronic graft -versus -host- disease ( GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic 
cell transplant that impairs quality of life, and is associated with significant morbidity and 
mortality. Management of chronic GVHD with prednisone is associated with an overall response rate of approximately 60%, and a complete response rate of approximately 30% but sclerotic features do not respond as well. Based on the biology of chronic GVHD and available preliminary evidence, we hypothesize that ruxolitini b will be effective in the management of 
sclerotic chronic GVHD.  The study is an open label, phase II multicenter trial designed to 
evaluate the efficacy of ruxolitinib as a salvage treatment for subject s with sclerotic GVHD 
(sclerosis or fasciitis). The primary objective is to determine the proportion of subject s with 
response rate ( complete and partial responses) in skin and/or joint, as determined by [ADDRESS_761123] s with chronic GVHD and skin, joint and/or fascia sclerosis, who have received systemic 
corticosteroids for >[ADDRESS_761124] s dosed ([ADDRESS_761125] s and estimated 10% dropout) will allow an α of 0.044 
and a power of 84% to test the null hypothesis response rate of 25% compared to an alt ernative 
of 45%. Subjects will receive ruxolitinib for 6 months for the treatment of sclerotic chronic GVHD. Subjects will be evaluated for GVHD status  as well as  non- relapse mortality, relapse of 
underlying malignancy and quality of life /functional status . Plasma cytokine levels and T/ NK 
cell subset in peripheral blood will be measured at various time points. The response rate will be reported as a proportion and 95% exact confidence interval. If positive, the trial results will support other ongoing studies to establish the role of ruxolitinib in chronic GVHD in general and specifically in sclerotic chronic GVHD.

Efficacy will be assessed by:  
• Determining the proportion of subject s with complete and partial responses in skin and/or 
joint, as determined by 2014 NIH Criteria (1), at [ADDRESS_761129] s with complete or partial responses overall, as determined 
by 2014 NIH Criteria (1), at 6 months of therapy. 
1.3 Exploratory Objectives  
The exploratory objectives are to assess the following: 
1. Treatment failure (treatment failure defined as: administration of additional systemic 
therapy for chronic GVHD, malignancy relapse or mortality) by 6 months from study enrollment 
2. Non-relapse mortality  by 6 months 
3. Change in patient-reported outcomes: skin subscale and summary score of the Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale, and Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire 
between enrollment and 6 months  
4. Response rate in skin/joint and overall at [ADDRESS_761130] s treated on the extension 
study  
5. Proportion who reduce prednisone (or prednisone equivalent) dose by 50% from baseline to 6 months 
1.4 Correlative Objectives  
1. Determine the association between responses at 6 months and the changes in the plasma 
levels of various proteins and cytokines (ST2, SPON1, CXCR3, CXCL10, IFN gamma, soluble IL- 2R, IL -2, IL-4, IL -5, IL-6, IL-12, TNF -α, TRAIL/ TNSFSF10/7 ; profibrotic 
cytokines such as IL- 1β and TGF -β) from baseline to 3 and 6 months.   
2. Determine the correlation between responses at 6 months and changes in the pe rcentage 
of peripheral blood T/NK-cell population (CD3 -CD56+) [Treg (FoxP3+) , effector T cell 
(CD8+T cell, CD4+ T
H1, T H2 and T H17 cells), CD3+, CD4-CD25+, Gr- 1, Ter -119, and 
Antigen presenting cells (APC) APC-CD80+] from baseline to 3 and 6 months.

UNMC IRB # 333-18, Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_761131] disease (GVHD) is a major late complication of allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) that affects up to 70% of HCT survivors. The 
syndrome is associated with major transplant-related morbidity, mortality, infectious complications, prolonged duration of immune suppression, and impaired patient-reported quality of life  (2-9). Thus, it represents a major obstacle to recovery and survival following HCT, and its 
prevention and treatment are of significant importance. The syndrome is characterized by [CONTACT_579412], but the most commonly affected organs are the skin, eyes, mouth, and liver.  
Sclerotic GVHD  is a distinctive phenotype of chronic GVHD that usually begins in superficial 
layer s of the skin and then extends to deeper layers. Sclerotic GVHD can severely affect 
patient s’ mobility and quality of life, and it is often refractory to standard and secondary 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . The presence of sclerosis after allogeneic HCT is considered diagnos tic for chronic 
GVHD (10). Progressive or poorly controlled sclerotic GVHD results in joint contractures, 
chronic skin ulcers and pulmonary restriction causing major disability. In a large study from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, the cumulative incidence of sclerosis was 20% at 3 years. Of the patients who developed sclerosis, 13% had only skin sclerosis, 33% had only joint contracture or fasciitis, and 53% had both clinical manifestations. The development of sclerosis was associated with a reduced rate of withdrawal of immunosuppressive treatment (11). These findings as well as our own experience indicate that patients with sclerotic chronic GVHD have poor quality of life, often require multiple sequential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_579391] (12 -15).  
Diagnosis and staging of chronic GVHD  
Diagnosis, classification and staging of chronic GVHD are based on the 2014 NIH Consensus 
Conference on Chronic GVHD (10). According to the historical classification, acute and chronic GVHD were distinguished by [CONTACT_579413] [ADDRESS_761132], namely classic chronic GVHD and overlap syndrome. Classic chronic GVHD is defined by [CONTACT_579414] (Appendix A ). Presence of 
both chronic and acute GVHD manifestations defines the overlap subtype of chronic GVHD (10). Chronic GVHD severity is scored according to objective criteria for each organ involved (Appendix B), which is summarized for an overall global severity score of mild, moderate, or severe (Appendix C) (10 ).  
Therapy of established chronic GVHD  
Accepted standard primary therapy for chronic GVHD includes 1 mg/kg or greater of prednisone (or prednisone equivalent) with or without a calcineurin inhibitor  (3, 16). The addition of other 
systemic immune -suppressive agents to initial therapy has not provided benefit, as evidenced by 
[CONTACT_380027], thalidomide, hydroxychloroquine or mycophenolate mofetil to initial treatment with steroids (17). Published primary chronic GVHD therapy trials demonstrate that on 
Page 7 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333-18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 average 30% will achieve complete response, and 60% will achieve overall response (complete + 
partial response) by 6- 9 months after starting initial therapy (16-21). However, sclerotic features 
do not respond as well. Consequently, most patients with chronic GVHD require salvage 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], which are frequently ineffective in sclerotic chronic GVHD (12 -15).  
Based on insufficient response to primary therapy or a fl are of chronic GVHD after tapering of 
initial therapy, many will go on to require additional immune-suppressive agents for chronic GVHD control.  
Steroid -refractory chronic GVHD  (22) is defined when: 
“Manifestations progress despi[INVESTIGATOR_201020] a regimen containing prednisone at ≥1 mg/kg/day for at least [ADDRESS_761133] without improvement despi[INVESTIGATOR_579392] ≥0.5 mg/kg/day or 1 mg/kg every other d ay for at least 4 weeks.”  
Such a definition is less relevant to eligibility criteria for trials beyond second -line treatment, 
because the decision to start second -line treatment has already been made (22).  
In addition to steroid- refractoriness, other clinical indications for additional lines of systemic 
immune suppressive therapy include steroid dependence and steroid intolerance. Patients with 
steroid -dependent chronic GVHD cannot tolerate tapering prednisone due to recurrent chronic 
GVHD manifestations. Steroid -dependent chronic GVHD  (22) is defined when: 
“Prednisone doses >0.25 mg/kg/day or >0.5 mg/kg every other day are needed to prevent recurrence or progression of manifestations as demonstrated by [CONTACT_579415] [ADDRESS_761134] 8 weeks.” 
Steroid intolerant patients have medical complications of steroid therapy (e.g., hyperglycemia, 
psychosis, osteoporosis), and thus require additional immune-suppressive agents to control GVHD and facilitate taper of prednisone. Multiple immune -suppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including 
pharmacologic agents, monoclonal antibodies, and strategies such as extracorporeal photopheresis have demonstrated moderate activity in this setting, both ameliorating objective chronic GVHD manifestations, as well as facilitating taper of systemic ster oids (reviewed in 
detail in the report of the Consensus Conference on Clinical Practice in Chronic GVHD) (23). 
Their effectiveness is suboptimal, however, and many patients will require multiple agents to achieve disease control or stabilization. For example, imatinib and rituximab are two commonly utilized therapi[INVESTIGATOR_579393]. A randomized phase II trial of imatinib versus rituximab for steroid refractory cutaneous sclerosis conducted at 11 institutions within the Chronic GVHD Consortium demonstr ated a significant clinical response rate of 26 -27% (15). 
The overall burden of chronic GVHD despi[INVESTIGATOR_380003], limited response to primary and secondary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , and the attendant morbidity and mortality all 
support the need for novel approaches in chronic GVHD treatment. 
In August 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved ibrutinib for management of 
chronic GVHD after failure of one or more treatments. Ibrutinib is the first therapy to receive FDA approval for the treatment of c hronic GVHD.  The approval was based on a multicenter 
single- arm trial of 42 patients with c hronic GVHD with inadequate response to corticosteroid  
(24). The best overall response was 67% at a median follow -up of 13.9 months. A total of 34 
Page 8 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333- 18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 patients had skin involvement, and 88% of these patients had a response. Details regarding the 
number of patients with skin sclerosis, fasciitis  or joint contractures , and responses in these 
patients are unavailable. Adverse events including infectious complications (69%, grade ≥ 3 
events 36%) were common and led to treatment discontinuation in 33% of patients. N o major 
hemorrhage event  was observe d, and grade 3 atrial fibrillation was reported in 1 patient in this 
study (24) . Nonetheless , the use of ibrutinib can be associated with a significant risk of 
complications in some patients including but not limited to those with cardiac arrhythmias, history of major bl eeding, or those requiring anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents  (25) . Hence, 
the use of ibrutinib may not be appropriate in some  patients . 
Patient -Reported Outcomes  
Chronic GVHD can severely affect patients’ quality of life (1). Progressive or poorly controlled sclerotic GVHD can also result in joint contractures, chronic  skin ulcers and pulmonary 
restriction causing major disability  (11) . Sclerotic GVHD is  difficult to assess; responses are 
slow, and potentially reversible active sclerotic manifestations are not easily distinguished from fixed, irreversible deficits. Hence, patient -reported quality of life measures can provide valuable 
insight regarding the impact of chronic GVHD, and changes in qual ity of life in response to 
therapy. Such patient -reported outcome measures can augment but not replace objective changes 
in chronic GVHD activity (1).  
Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale  (26)  (Appendix D ), recommended by [CONTACT_941] 2014 NIH 
Consensus conference (1), will be utilized as measures of patient- reported outcomes in this 
study. The Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale (26)  provides a global assessment of the burden 
of a symptom resulting from varying intensity of the symptom, its frequency, and its emotional and functional impact. Additionally, Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire  (Appendix 
E) will be used (27, 28) . There are no validated functional or quality of life measures specifically 
for patients with sclerotic GVHD. The Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire, a 
validated self -reported functional status measure in scleroderma, will therefore be utilized given 
the similarity b etween sclerotic GVHD and scleroderma.  An improvement (decrease) in the 
SHAQ score by ≥0.2 is considered clinically meaningful (15, 27, 29) . 
Biomarkers in chronic GVHD  
The 2014 NIH Biomarker Working Group Report states that the development of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers is critically necessary and  represents the areas of high priority in chronic 
GVHD (30). In this study, we will measure the percentage of peripheral blood T/NK -cell 
population and the plasma levels of various proteins and cytokines (ST2, SPON1, CXCL10, IFN gamma, soluble IL -2R, IL -2, IL -6, TNF -α; profibrotic cytokines such as IL -1β and TGF -β) at 
various time points . Such assessment s may allow identification of predictive biomarker s and 
provide insights into the biology of sclerotic chronic GVHD, and the pharmacodynamic effect of ruxolitinib in sclerotic chronic GVHD.  
In a murine model, ruxolitini b reduced proliferation of effector T cells and suppression of 
proinflammatory cytokine production (such as TNF -alpha and IL -12p70). Further, differentiation 
of CD4+T cells into IFN -gamma and IL17A -producing T -cells (implicated in GVHD) was 
impaired (31) . In patients with steroid refractory acute and chronic GVHD, responses  correlated 
with an increase in FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, as well as a reduction in the serum levels of IL-6 
and soluble IL -2 receptor (31) . Zeiser et al demonstrated a decline in CD3+HLA- DR+ cells, IL -6 
Page 9 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333- 18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 and soluble IL -2R in peripheral blood after ruxolitinib treatment (32) . In myelofibrosis, the use 
of ruxolitinib was associated with suppression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL -6, and 
TNF -alpha (33) . Henc e, the changes in T -cell subsets and cytokine levels correlate with GVHD 
activity and are associated with responses to ruxolitinib.  
Although the pathogenesis of chronic GVHD is complex and still incompletely understood, 
various T/NK -cell subsets play an im portant role in various phases of the development of chronic 
GVHD (34). T/NK- cell subsets such as CD8+T cells and NK -cells are the main effector 
populations in the adaptive immune system responsible for chronic GVHD. Regulatory populations such as Tregs  provide compensatory inhibition to limit chronic inflammation and 
tissue injury. The relative predominance of effector or regulatory cells determine whether chronic GVHD is active or absent. Other T -cell subsets such as T
H2 and T H17 cells are 
considered pro -fibrotic and may contribute to fibrosis (34) . Whereas many cytokine s are 
implicated in sclerosis and dampened by [CONTACT_579416] (31) , two -protein biomarker s (Spondin- 1, 
ST2) may correlate with longitudinal changes in scleros is (35) . CXCL10 is elevated in sclerosis, 
and level s may corr elate with  clinical worsening or responses (36). This molecular underpi[INVESTIGATOR_579394] e for the proposed test s in this trial. 
Ruxolitinib  
Detail ed information is available in the attached investigator brochure.  
Ruxolitinib (INCB018424 phosphate, INC424, ruxolitinib phosphate) represents a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of JAK1 (Janus kinase 1) (inhibition concentration 50%  
[IC50]=3.3 ± 1.2 nM) and JAK2 (IC50=2.8 ± 1.2 nM) with modest to marked selec tivity  against 
TYK2 (tyrosine kinase 2) (IC50=19 ± 3.2 nM) and JAK3 (IC50=428 ± 243 nM), respectively. Ruxolitinib interferes with the signaling of a number of cytokines and growth factors that are important for hematopoiesis and immune function. 
JAK signa ling involves recruitment of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) 
to cytokine receptors, activation, and subsequent localization of STATs to the  nucleus leading to 
modulation of gene expression. Dysregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway has been associated 
with several types of cancer and increased proliferation and survival of  malignant cells. In 
particular, this pathway may be dysregulated in the majority of patients  with Philadelphia 
chromosome -negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs, including myelofibrosis (MF) and 
polycythemia vera (PV), suggesting that JAK inhibition may be  efficacious in these diseases.  
Ruxolitinib is currently under development for the treatment of MF , PV, essential  
thrombocytopenia (ET) , GVHD and other hematologic  malignancies and has been granted 
Marketing Authorization Approval for the treatment of  MF and PV.  
Summary of clinical efficacy data  
The results from two Phase III studies in myelofibrosis (COMFORT -I, COMFORT -II) 
demonstrate the effectiveness of ruxolitinib in patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF),  post -
polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV -MF) or post -essential thrombocythemia  myelofibrosis 
(PET -MF). The results of these two studies were consistent, demonstrating st atistically 
significant (p<0.0001) improvement in rates of ≥35% spleen volume reduction compared with 
Page 10 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333- 18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 either placebo or an investigator’s selection of best available therapy (BAT). Ruxolitinib was 
associated with prolonged survival compared with placebo (C OMFORT -I) and best available 
therapy (COMFORT -II). 
Consistent with its activity in myelofibrosis, ruxolitinib demonstrated efficacy in a related  
myeloproliferative neoplasm, polycythemia vera in the RESPONSE and RESPONSE -2 studies. 
A significantly greater proportion of patients who were randomized to ruxolitinib met the primary endpoint of the RESPONSE study, which was a composite endpoint of  hematocrit 
control in the absence of phlebotomy and spleen volume reduction ≥35% when compared to patients randomize d to BAT (22.7% vs. 0.9%, p<0.0001). Of the patients  meeting the primary 
endpoint at Week 32, 88% maintained their response at Week 48, and 80% maintained their response for at least 48 weeks from initial response. The efficacy  analyses at Week 80 data 
cutoff (03 -Sept 2014) for the RESPONSE study confirmed the  durability of the responses in the 
patients randomized to ruxolitinib arm. The RESPONSE -[ADDRESS_761135] -hydroxyurea patient  population. 
Summary of clinical safety data  
In the randomized period of the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_579395], COMFORT -I and COMFORT -II 
(cut-off 01 -Mar-2011, median duration of exposure = 10.8 months) discontinuation due to 
adverse events, regardless of causality was observed in 11.3% of patients. The most  frequently 
reported adverse drug reactions were thrombocytopenia and anemia. Hematological adverse reactions (any CTCAE Grade) included anemia (82.4%), thrombocytopenia (69.8%) and neutropenia (16.6%). Anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are dose -related effects. The 
three most frequent non- hematological adverse  reactions were bruising (21.6%), dizziness 
(15.3%) and headache (14.0%). The three most  frequent non- hematological laboratory 
abnormalities were raised alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (27.2%), raised aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) (18.6%) and hypercholesterolemia  (16.9%).  
Long- term follow -up in patients with MF (inc luding 615 patients treated with ruxolitinib during 
the controlled and extension phases of studies INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 251: cut -off [ADDRESS_761136]-2012.  
COMFORT -I: 15-Oct-2015; COMFORT -II: 20 -Apr-2015) has shown that as expected, the  
numbers and proportions of AEs and SAEs  has increased. However, no new safety signals  have 
emerged (median duration of exposure for this population is 28.78 months, with 1578.45 patient -
years of exposure).  
Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 established 5 mg b.i.d. as a safe starting dose in patients with PMF , 
PPVMF, and PET -MF, with a platelet count between 50 and 100 × 109/L. 
Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]- [ADDRESS_761137] on hematologic parameters than seen in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_232610].  
Up to Week 32 of the randomized phase in the RESPONSE trial (median duration of exposure  
was 7.8 months), ruxolitinib was generally well tolerated in patients with PV and only a small  
proportion of patients discontinued ruxolitinib due to AEs (6.4%). Most of the AEs have been 
Page 11 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333- 18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 managed by [CONTACT_579417]/or supportive care. Hematological toxicities were less  frequent 
and less severe in patients with PV as compared to  those observed in patients with MF. Analysis 
of Week 80 data did not identify any new safety findings.  
The AE profile of the compound has been assessed in more than 370 healthy volunteers, subjects 
with various degrees of renal (n=32) or hepatic (n=24) i mpairment, and in patients  with RA 
(n=59) receiving ruxolitinib: AEs were, in general, mild and resolved without  interventions. 
A thorough QT study was conducted in 50 healthy subjects. There was no indication of a  
QT/QTc prolonging effect of ruxolitinib i n single doses up to a supra -therapeutic dose of [ADDRESS_761138] d isease  
A study in MHC -mismatched mouse transplan t model has demonstrated that interferon (IFN) -
gamma receptor signaling via induction of chemokine receptor CXCR3 alters alloreactive T -cell 
trafficking to GVHD target organs and reduces GVHD (37) . The same study also highlighted 
that p harmacologic inhibition of IFN -gamma receptor  signaling with ruxolitinib reduces GVHD 
and improves survival  after allogeneic HCT  (37) . Subsequent studies in murine models 
confirmed that the use of ruxolitinib mitigated GVHD (31, 38, 39)  while preserving graft -versus -
leukemia effect (38, 39) . In a murine model, ruxolitinib also reduced proliferation of eff ector T 
cells and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production ( such as TNF -alpha  and IL -
12p70) . Further, differentiation of CD4+T cells into IFN -gamma and IL17A -producing T -cells 
(implicated in GVHD) was impaired  (31) . 
Subsequent studies have provided evidence of clinical efficacy and safety of  ruxolitinib in 
patients with steroid refractory acute and chronic GVHD  including patients with cutaneous and 
musculoskeletal chronic GVHD  (31, 32, 40) . Spoerl et al. demonstrated responses in 6 patients 
with steroid refractory acute and chronic GVHD  (31). In a retrospective multicenter study (n=95)  
(32), ruxolitinib at a dose of 5–10 mg orally twice daily was studied as a salvage therapy for 
steroid refractory grade III/IV acute (n=54) or moderate or severe chronic (n=41) GVHD.  
Patients with chronic GVHD were heavily pre -treated with a median of 3 (range 1- 10) prior 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Patients were followed for a median of 22 (3–135) weeks. Ruxolitinib resulted in an 
overall response rate of 85%  with a rate of GVHD -relapse of 5.7%  in re sponding patients , and 6-
month survival of 97% . The median time from initiation of ruxolitinib to response was 3 (1 –25) 
weeks. Cytopenia and CMV reactivation was observed in 17% and 15% of patients . Cytopenias 
preceded the use of ruxolitinib in most of the  patients  (15%). CMV reactivation responded to 
antiviral therapy . Relapse of underlying malignancy was reported in 2.4% of patients  (32) . 
Additional follow -up of these patients have demonstrated a one -year survival of 92.7%. 
Approximately, 24% of patients have an ongoing response and are free of any immunosuppres sion, whereas 86% of patients (n=13) with GVHD relapse or progression 
responded to retreatment with ruxolitinib or any immunosuppressive therapy (41) . These res ults 
provide preliminary evidence of the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in chronic GVHD patients.  
Study Design and Rational e 
The study is an open label, phase II multicenter trial designed to evaluate ruxolitinib as a salvage treatment for patients with sclerotic GVHD (sclerosis or fasciitis). Previous trials (12 -15) and our 
own experiences have demonstrated that patients with sclerotic chronic GVHD have poor quality 
Page 12 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333-18, Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_761139] exhausted other treatment options. 
Preliminary evidence indicates that ruxolitinib may be effective in previously treated patients with sclerotic chronic GVHD (31, 32). In this context, the overarching goal of the study is to assess the role of ruxolitinib in the management of steroid refractory sclerotic chronic GVHD.

In the event of an after -hours potential enrollment (i.e., clinic coast time differences), or an 
immediate need for convenience for the subject, please contact [CONTACT_579423] [INVESTIGATOR_579396].   
An electronic copy of the signed and dated consent form for each subject registered from all sites  
to the protocol is uploaded to the Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS)  within [ADDRESS_761145] s with sclerotic GVHD (sclerosis or fasciitis).   
5.1 Treatment Schedule and Administration: Ruxolitinib   
Drug  Dose/Frequency  Duratio n Administration  
Ruxolitinib  [ADDRESS_761146] stable disease, mixed responses or partial/complete responses at 
the end of 6 months may continue the drug for a total of 12 months. Subjects  with chronic 
GVHD progression ( not including stable disease or mixed responses) at the end of 6 months will 
stop ruxolitinib, regardless of whether or not a new systemic therapy has been added. 
Ruxolitinib taper  prior to discontinuation 
At the end of 6 months, or 12 months for subjects  treated on extension study, ruxolitinib will be 
tapered over a month before discontinuation, for example, a dose reduction by 5 mg every 1-2 weeks. Ruxolitinib may be stopped without a taper in cases of unacceptable toxicities. If an

equivalent dose) for at least a week  to avoid rebound symptoms. While coming off ruxolitinib, 
subjects  should be carefully monitored for worsening of GVHD symptoms or any other 
withdrawal symptoms.   
5.1.[ADDRESS_761148] a partial re sponse is achieved; dose adjustment to 
achieve a desired drug level is allowed. However, subjects  on prednisone may continue to taper 
prednisone at the discretion of the treating physician. Increase in prednisone dose (or prednisone equivalent dose) to  a dose lo wer than or up to the prednisone dose at enrollment is acceptable to 
control disease symptoms, however, an increase in the dose of prednisone higher than the dose at 
enrollment will be considered a new systemic treatment and thus, therapy failure (1).  
Subjects  who start a new systemic immunosuppressive agent to control chronic GVHD (1) a re 
considered therapy failures for which ruxolitinib will be discontinued.  A short course of an immunosuppressive agent (<2 weeks) for a clearly documented non-chronic GVHD indication (e.g., stress dose steroids in someone on chronic steroids, a short pulse of steroids for an allergic reaction ) will not be considered treatment failure unless it extends longer than 2 weeks.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_81967] (including FAM or intra -oral n arrow -band UVB phototherapy ) can be initiated or 
stopped at the discretion of the treating physician  while ruxolitinib is continued and are not 
considered treatment failures . For the purpose of this study, “FAM” (fluticasone, azithromycin 
and montelukast) therapy for lung GVHD will be considered a topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588].

degree of toxicities.  As such, this trial will allow treating physicians to use discretion regarding 
dose modifications of ruxolitinib but only under certain situations as specified in this section.  
For subjects  with grade 2 or lower hematologic or non- hematologic toxicities, ruxolitinib may be 
continued at the current dose or dose reduced by 50% at the discretion of the treating physician . 
Dose reduction by 50% (i.e. reduction to 5 mg BID in subjects  receiving 10 mg BID) or 
temporary drug cessation is allowed in subjects  with certain grade ≥3 hematologic or non-
hematologic toxicities  (see table below) . Subjects  who require drug cessation will resume 
ruxolitinib at a dose no higher than [ADDRESS_761150] 2 weeks before resuming their previous 
dose. Subjects  with grade 3- 4 toxicities are required to undergo close monitoring with repeat 
testing of any abnormal laboratory or clinical parameter(s) within  2-7 days depending on specific 
circumstances .

5.2.1 Dose reduction for Concomitant Medications  
50% dose reduction should be considered when using medicinal products which are dual 
inhibitors of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes (e.g. fluconazole). Avoid the concomitant use of ruxolitinib with fluconazole doses greater than 200 mg daily. 
When administering ruxolitinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, the total daily dose should be reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 50%.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include boceprevir, clarithromycin, cobicistat, conivaptan, danoprevir/ritonavir,eltegravir/ritonavir, grapefruit juice , idelalisib, 
indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, LCL161, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, sequinavir/ritonavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, 
voriconazole, indinavir/ritonavir, tipranoavir/ritonavir, and troleandomycin.  
No dose adjustment is necessary when co- administering ruxolitinib with strong  CYP3A4 
inducers. 
No dose adjustment is necessary when co-administering ruxolitinib with CYP3A4 substrates. Ruxolitinib did not decrease the exposure of a fixed dose oral contraceptive metabolized via the 
CYP3A4 pathway, thus demonstrating lack of CYP3A4 induction potential.

 5.7 Correlative Studies  
The correlative objectives  for this trial are to:  
1. Determine the correlation between response at 6 months and change in the 
expression level of various cytokines (ST2, SPON1, , CXCR3, CXCL10, IFN 
gamma, soluble IL- 2R, IL -2, IL-4, IL -5, IL-6, IL-12, TNF -α, 
TRAIL/ TNSFSF10/7 ; profibrotic cytokines such as IL- 1β and TGF -β). 
2. Determine the correlation between response at 6 months and change in the 
percentage of peripheral blood T/NK-cell population (CD3 -CD56+) [Treg  
(FoxP3+) , effector T cell (CD8+T cell, CD4+ T H1, T H2 and T H17 cel ls), CD3+, 
CD4 -CD25+, Gr-1, Ter-119,  and Antigen presenting cells (APC) APC-CD80+] 
These studies aim to determine the correlation and to quantitate the changes of the above from 
plasma and peripheral blood samples obtained at baseline (pre- treatment), and  at 3 and 6 month 
time points.  Collection and handling instructions are provided in Study Site Manual.  For each 
time point, 2x10 mL whole blood will be collected in EDTA treated tubes for quantitation of the 
various cytokines by [CONTACT_579425].  Additionally, 8 mL blood 
will be collected in sodium heparin treated tubes and processed for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) prior to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_579400] T/NK /APC  popul ation .  If any  samples remain after analysis for this 
study, these samples will be maintained at UNMC central lab for future unspecified use. 
Please s ee study lab manual for additional information regarding processing before shippi[INVESTIGATOR_579401] c entral lab fo r isolation and analysis of samples. 
5.8  Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)  
5.8.1 Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale 
Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale (26) measures the degree of “bother” that subjects  have 
experienced due to symptoms in 7 domains. These domains potentially affected by [CONTACT_579426], eyes and mouth, breathing, eating and digestion, muscles and joints, energy, emotional distress .  This can be found in Appendix D and the Study Site Manual .  
5.8.2 Modified Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire 
The Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire is based on the Health Assessment Questionnaire, an instrument initially developed for rheumatoid arthritis patients.  Both instruments contain 20 items measuring activities of daily living on a 4 point scale (0 -3) from 
“without any difficulty” to “unable to do.” The Scleroderma modification added 5 visual analog scales specific for scleroderma disease activity (pain, Raynaud’s phenomenon, finger ulcers, intestinal problems, breathing problems, overall severity) (27, 28). T hree of these problems 
(Raynau d’s, finger ulcers and intestinal problems) are unlikely in sclerotic GVHD, and will not

6.1 Assessment of therapeutic response in chronic GVHD  
The established method for response determination in the majority of chronic GVHD therapy 
trials is clinician -determined response based on organ scoring. The Response Criteria Working 
Group Report from the 2014 NIH Consensus Conference on chronic GVHD has recommended three general categories of overall response: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and lack of response (unchanged, mixed response, progression) (1). Further details are provided in the Appendix B and G. 
The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the proportion of subjects  with complete and 
partial responses in skin and/or joint, which are defined by 2014 NIH Criteria (1) as follow:  
Complete response (CR) in skin and/or joint require s NIH skin and joint score 0, and P- ROM 
score of 25. Partial response in skin and/or joint requires decrease in NIH skin score OR joint score by 1 or 
more points, or increase in P-ROM score by 1 point for any site.

Section 8.0 Drug Formulation and Procurement  
8.1 Ruxolitinib   
Details available in the investigator brochure.   
8.1.1 Mechanism of Action  
Ruxolitinib (INCB018424 phosphate, INC424, ruxolitinib phosphate) represents a novel, potent, 
and selective inhibitor of JAK1 (Janus kinase 1) (inhibition concentration 50%[IC50]=3.3 ± 1.2 nM) and JAK2 (IC50=2.8 ± 1.2 nM) with modest to marked selectivity against TYK2 (tyrosine kinase 2) (IC50=19 ± 3.2 nM) and JAK3 (IC50=428 ± 243 nM), respectively. Ruxolitinib interferes with the signaling of a number of cytokines and growth factors that are important for hematopoiesis and immune function. 
8.1.2 Clinical Formulation  
Available for oral administration  as 5 mg tablet.  Ruxolitinib tablets are round and white to off-
white in color. 8.1.3 Drug procurement  
Open label ruxolitinib will be supplied by [CONTACT_109912].  Ruxolitinib tablets (5 mg) will be 
administered as oral d oses without regard to food in an outpatient setting.   
  
Page 27 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333- 18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 8.1.4 Packaging and Labeling 
Ruxolitinib 5 mg tablets are packaged as 60- count in high- density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles. 
The bottles will include labeling “New Drug -  Limited by [CONTACT_4496] ([LOCATION_003]) Law  to Investigational 
Use”.  
8.1.5 Storage/Stability  
The bottles of tablets should be stored at room temperature, 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). 
Stability studies will be conducted on all clinical batches to support the clinical trial.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_761179] should be  instructed in the handling of study drug as follows:  
• •To store the study drug at room temperature.  
• •To only remove from the study drug bottle/kit the number of tablets needed at the time 
of administration.  
• •Not to remove doses in advance of the next scheduled administration. 
• •To make every effort to take doses on schedule. However, doses can be taken up to 8 
hours after scheduled time . 
• •To report any missed doses. 
• •To take study drug without regard to food with a glass of water.  
• •Not to take another dose if vomiting occurs after taking study drug. 
• •To keep study drug in a safe place and out of reach of children.  
• •To bring all used and unused study drug kits to the site at each visit. 
8.1.8 Clinical Pharmacology  
Fifteen Phase I, nine Phase II and three Phase III clinical studies (two in MF,  one in PV) 
provided clinical pharmacology data on ruxolitinib in healthy volunteers and in patients with 
MF, ET, PV, subjects with renal or hepatic impairment, prostate cancer,  pancreatic cancer, 
multiple myeloma (MM)  or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral absorption  of ruxolitinib is rapid and 
nearly complete, with ≥95% absorption indicating high in vivo permeability in the human gastrointestinal tract, consistent with a Biopharmaceutical  
Classification System (BCS) Class  I compound. Mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax)  is 
achieved [ADDRESS_761180] -dose.  
• The effect of food on ruxolitinib exposure is minimal and is not expected to be clinically 
significant; as a result, the drug may be administered either with or without food. 
• Dose proportional exposure is observed between 5 and 200 mg dose range with linear  
pharmacokinetics (PK).  
Page 28 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333- 18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 • Plasma protein binding is approximately 97% ex vivo. There is moderate distribution to 
organs and tissues with no long- term retention of drug- related material in preclinical 
species and limited drug penetration into the central nervous system (CNS) or across the  
blood- brain barrier.  
• There is >95% [14C] -ruxolitinib recovery in a mass balance study with 74% and 22% of  
the dose excreted in urine and fece s of healthy subjects, respectively. Less than 1% of the  
administered dose is recovered in urine and feces as unchanged parent drug. 
• The mean terminal elimination half -life is ~3 hour with no appreciable accumulation of  
either parent or metabolites with tw ice daily dosing. 
• Metabolism is predominantly via the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP3A4 to yield oxygenated and subsequent conjugated metabolites. 
• Oxidative metabolites of ruxolitinib retain pharmacological activity albeit with one half to one fifth of the ac tivity of the parent compound. Ex vivo 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis indicates that the total of 8 active  
metabolites contribute to 18% of the overall PD activity of ruxolitinib.  
• Ruxolitinib PK in healthy volunteers was largely comparable between Japanese, Chinese 
and Western subjects and did not lead to a conclusion of meaningful ethnic differences.  
• Baseline elevations in inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL) -6, and C -reactive protein (CRP) noted in patients with MF was 
associated with constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, pruritus, and night sweats. 
Decreases were observed in these markers over the [ADDRESS_761181] ory to the effects of ruxolitinib 
treatment.  
8.1.9 Pote ntial Drug Interactions  
50% dose reduction should be considered when using medicinal products which are dual 
inhibitors of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes (e.g. fluconazole). Avoid the concomitant  use of 
ruxolitinib with fluconazole doses greater than 200 mg daily.
 
• When administering ruxolitinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, the total daily dose 
should be reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 50%.  
• No dose adjustment is necessary when co -administering ruxolitinib with str ong CYP3A4 
inducers.  
• No dose adjustment is necessary when co -administering ruxolitinib with CYP3A4 
substrates.  
• Ruxolitinib did not decrease the exposure of a fixed dose oral contraceptive metabolized via the CYP3A4 pathway, thus demonstrating lack of CYP3A4 induction potential. 
8.1.10 Drug toxicities  
The following drug toxicities were noted in trials mostly involving patients with myelofibrosis 
and polycythemia vera.  
Page 29 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333- 18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 Blood and lymphatic system disorders:  
Anemia (40.8- 82.4%), thrombocytopenia (16.8- 69.8%), neutropenia (16.6%). Also includes 
febrile neutropenia. Cytopenias are dose dependent and reversible with dose reduction/ 
interruption. 
Infections and infestations:  
Urinary tract infections (6 -12.6%) Including urosepsis, Cystitis, Kidney infection, U rinary tract 
infection bacterial, Nitrite urine present, and pyuria.  Pneumonia (8.3%)   Herpes zoster (4.0-
4.3%)   Tuberculosis (0.3%)  
Gastrointestinal disorders:  
Flatulence ( 3.3% ) and Constipation (8.7%). 
Hepatic dysfunction:  
Raised alanine aminotransferase (22.3 -27.2%) and aspartate aminotransferase (19.9- 26.1%)  
Metabolism and nutrition disorders:  
Weight gain (7.6- 12.3%) ,  Hypercholesterolemia (16.9- 20.7%) ,  Hypertriglyceridemia (9.8%)  
Nervous system disorders : 
Dizziness (12.0- 15.3%%) ,  Head ache (14.0%)  
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : 
Bruising (21.6%) including hematoma, petechiae and purpura   
Vascular disorders : 
Hypertension (6.5%)  
General disorders and administration site conditions:  
In clinical studies in myelofibrosis, fatigue, bone  pain, pyrexia, pruritus, night sweats, 
splenomegaly and weight loss noted in 60.4% after discontinuation of  ruxolitinib.  
In a retrospective study of ruxolitinib in patients with chronic GVHD, c ytopenia and CMV 
reactivation was observed in 17% and 15% of patients. Cytopenias preceded the use of 
ruxolitinib in most of the patients (15%).  
Progressive Multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported with ruxolitinib treatment. Physicians should be alert for neuropsychiatric symptoms suggestive of PML . If PML is 
suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded.  
Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), including basal cell, squamous cell, and Merkel cell  
carcinoma have been reported in patients treated with ruxolitinib. Most of these pa tients had  
histories of extended treatment with hydroxyurea and prior histories of NMSC or pre - malignant 
skin lesions. A causal relationship to ruxolitinib has not been established. Periodic  skin 
examination is recommended for patients who are at increase d risk for skin cancer.  
8.1.11    Drug Accountability  
Page 30 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333-18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 Responsibility for drug accountability at the study site rests with the investigator; however, the 
investigator may assign some of the drug accountability duties to an appropriate pharmacist or designee.  Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_147117]. 
The investigator or designee will be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially 
used containers of study medication until the end of the study.  The Investigator or designee must maintain records that document: 
• investigational product delivery to the study site 
• the inventory at the si te 
• use by [CONTACT_488308][INVESTIGATOR_4382]/unit counts from each supply dispensed 
• product returned to the investigator or designee.   
These records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers (if available), and the unique code numbers (if available) assigned to the investigational product and study subjects.   
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the protocol.  The investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the study 
medication specified.  
Completed accountability records will be archived by [CONTACT_779]. If any unused ruxolitinib bottles remain at the end of the study, they will be accounted for by [CONTACT_579427] . If a 
site is able to destroy ruxolitinib at their premises, or through a certified vendor, they may do so upon authorization by [CONTACT_456], provided their destruction policy is made available to the sponsor. 
Section 9.0 Toxicity and Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines 
This protocol will comply with monitoring and adverse event reporting requirements of the UNMC Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center Data Monitoring plan. The protocol will adhere to the institutional and FDA guidelines for the toxicity reporting.  
All subjects  will be closely followed for toxicity from the time of informed consent until [ADDRESS_761182] administration of study medication. The reporting is only for “study medication,” until 
[ADDRESS_761183] administration of study medication.  
Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed by [CONTACT_579428]/Investigator 
and by [CONTACT_31029]. Per NCI guidelines, serious adverse events (SAEs ) and AEs will 
be graded and t oxicity will be  assessed using the revised NCI CTCAE version 4.03 (Appendix 
H). Adverse event will be followed until resolution, baseline or ≤ grade 1 levels. 
Serious adverse events should be followed until resolution, baselin e or ≤ grade 1 levels , death, or 
until no further improvement is reasonably expected. Deaths occurring within 30 days of study treatment regardless of relationship will be reported to the Fre d & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center  
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) .  
9.1 Definitions  
Page 31 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333- 18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal  relationship 
with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) produc t, whether or not the event is 
considered causally related to the use of the product.  
An elective surgery or procedure that is scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered 
an adverse event if the surgery or procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and 
the surgery or procedure has been planned before study entry. However, if the pre -existing 
condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study ( e.g., the surgery is performed earlier than 
planned), then the deterioration of the c ondition for which the elective surgery or procedure is 
being done will be considered an adverse event.  
Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event. Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events if they result in 
discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, require dose modifications  and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.  
Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected advers e event is any adverse drug event that is not listed in the current 
labeling/Investigator’s Brochure. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, refers to an adverse 
drug experience that has not been previously observed (i.e., included in the labeling) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical product.  
Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is one that at any dose (including overdose) and regardless of causalit y:  
• Results in death  
• Is a serious threat to life, health, safety or welfare -fare of subject 
1  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Require s intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage  
• Results in p ersistent or significant disability or incapacity2  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is another serious  important medical event3  
• Is any medical event in an investigational drug st udy that requires treatment to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
• Seriously jeopardizes t he rights, safety, or welfare of subjects  
1“Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the serious 
adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe.  
2“Persistent or significant  disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
3Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in situations whe re none of the outcomes listed above occurred. Important medical events that 
Page 32 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333- 18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_579404] d in the definition above 
should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospit alization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. A new 
diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be considered as medically important.  
9.2 Adverse Event Reporting and Definitions Per University of Nebraska Medical 
Center, IRB and Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) and Incyte Corporation  
This protocol will adhere to all institutional guidelines for adverse event reporting. Adverse events will be evaluated using the NCI Common Term inology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTC AE) version 4.03 (Appendix H) .  
9.2.1 IRB Reporting   
All internal serious adverse events (AE) must be reported to the local IRB promptly per institutional policy and in no case later than two (2) business days follow ing PI [INVESTIGATOR_579405] A, and B, are met:  
a. The AE is unexpected, AND  
b. The AE is related to, or possibly related to, the drug, biologic, device, or other research interventi on  
 All unexpected , internal, fatal AEs must be reported promptly to the local IRB per institutional 
policy, but no later than [ADDRESS_761184] be notified by a telephone call or e -mail.  
All expected , internal, fatal AEs (i.e., due to progressive disease or which reflect a risk currently 
found in the consent form) must be reported to the local IRB per institutional policy no later than ten (10) business days following PI [INVESTIGATOR_579406].  
9.2.2 Fred  & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) Reporting  
In its initial review, the DSMC will make a recommendation for the frequency of DSMC 
monitoring based on an assessment of risk associated with study- associated therapy, per the 
DSMC policy. Reporting of the following will be done in accordance with DSMC guidelines:
 
• All Serious adverse events  (SAEs) and toxicity reporting will be reported to the DSMC.  
• All adverse events grade 3 or higher (expected or unexpected, regardless of attribution) 
will be reported to the DSMC.  
Attribution of AE: The likelihood of relationship of the AE to the study drugs will be determined 
by [CONTACT_194990]:  
Not related: The subject was not exposed to the study treatment or another cause is obvious.  
Page 33 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333-18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 Probably not related: The AE is most likely explained by [CONTACT_5748], and the time of 
occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related to the study treatment.  
Possibly relate d: Study treatment administration and AE occurrence reasonably related in time, 
and the AE is explained equally well by [CONTACT_172841], or treatment 
administration and AE occurrence are not reasonably related in time, but the AE is not obviously a result of other causes.  
Probably related: Study treatment administration and AE occurrence are reasonably related in time, and the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_172842].  
Definitely related: The occurrence and timing of the AE are clearly attributable to the study 
treatment.  
AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs the consent form and ending 30 days following the final dose of study drug. All AEs will be followed until resolution , a cause is 
identified , or until no further improvement is expected. AEs judged by [CONTACT_579429] 30 days after the final dose of study drug. 
All SAEs and AE reporting will be completed using DSMC approved forms.
  Detailed policy 
and procedures for this section may be reviewed at: 
http://www.unmc.edu/cancercenter/clinical/prms.html  
9.2.[ADDRESS_761185] safety , every Serious Adverse Event (SAE), occurring after the subject has 
consented and until at least [ADDRESS_761186] (ruxolitinib) must be report ed to Incyte  within twenty four ( 24) hours  of learning of the event.  
If a subject experiences a SAE after signing informed consent, but prior to receiving ruxolitinib, the event will NOT be collected unless the investigator feels the event may have been caused by a protocol procedure.  Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent document) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened during the course of the study. 
All SAEs  are to be captured on Incyte’s Adverse Event Report Form.  
The study sites will submit the SAEs  to Incyte via [EMAIL_11031]
. If critical or 
outstanding information is missing from the Adverse Event Report Form or additional 
clarification is needed, the Incyte representative will submit a Data Clarification Form (DCF) to the Sponsor-Investigator. The Sponsor will be required to complete all queries listed on the DCF and return the completed DCF to Incyte. 
The Sponsor-Investigator must report t o Incyte all Serious Adverse Events regardless of the 
causality assessment.  
Page 34 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333-18, Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_761187] be report ed 
to Incyte on a new or updated Adverse Event Report Form twenty four (24) hours  of becoming 
aware of the information.  
Reconciliation  
On a periodic basis (quarterly at minimum), the Sponsor-Investigator  will provide a listing of all 
Safety Information recorded for the study to Incyte for reconciliation purposes.  The Sponsor-
Investigator will forward the listing via email to [EMAIL_2919]   
Interventional Investigator Initiated Trials 
The Sponsor-Investigator reports all Suspect Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) 
to the relevant Health Authority where the Investigational New Drug (IND) was approved for the 
Sponsor-Investigator and distributes Investigator Notifications (IN) as required by [CONTACT_427].  
Incyte will submit to the relevant Health Autho rities outside of Sponsor-Investigator’s approved 
countries and distributes Investigator N otification s to other Investigators as applicable. 
• The Sponsor-Investigator will author the Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) 
and share the completed DSUR with Incyte for comment prior to submission to the health 
authority. 
Pregnancies  
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an adverse event, unless there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_579407] a contraceptive medication or 
method.  The procedures to be followed based on a confirmed pregnancy by a positive serum test result are listed below:  
• Investigator and subject must notify each other imm ediately  
• Investigator must notify the Investigator –Sponsor and Incyte immediately  
• Discontinue study medication immediately  
• Perform the required End-of- treatment visit study evaluations  
• Investigator must complete and submit the Pregnancy Initial and Follow- up report forms 
to the Sponsor 
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a subject during maternal or paternal exposures to 
study drug must be reported within [ADDRESS_761188] be reported on the SAE Report Form and needs to 
be reported to the Investigator-Sponsor and Incyte. 
9.3 Monitoring  Various methods will be implemented by [CONTACT_456] (UNMC) to exchange information with 
participating sites:  
• Site Initiation/Orientation  
Page 35 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333-18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 • Regular  Teleconferences including group wide progress within the agenda  
• Investigator meetings as feasible (remote or on an as needed basis , possibly in 
conjunction with larger meetings)  
• Email distributions/reports as needed  
9.3.[ADDRESS_761189] operating procedures (SOPs), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory requirement(s).  Monitoring is a Quality Control, continuous process during the entire trial. 
All participating sites will perform routine data monitoring for this study by [CONTACT_25733]’s 
institution according to the institution’s internal guidelines and policies.  A copy of the site’s monitoring report will be submitted to UNMC.  
9.4 Auditing  
Auditing is a systematic and independent examination of trial- related activities and documents to 
determine : 
• whether the evaluated trial -related activities wer e conducted  
•  the data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported, according to the protocol, to 
the sponsor's SOPs, GCP, and applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
Auditing is a Quality Assurance, one point process during the trial. 
The UNMC Fred & P amela Buffett Cancer Center Scientific Review Committee (SRC) will 
review this protocol on at least an annual basis.  
This study will undergo audit on at least a semi -annual  basis by [CONTACT_172848] & Pamela 
Buffett Cancer Center Audit Committee.  Detailed policy and procedures for this section may be reviewed at: 
https://www.unmc.edu/cancercenter/clinical/prms.html.  
Section 10.[ADDRESS_761190] s with sclerotic GVHD (sclerosis or fasciitis).   
If a subject  receives one dose of ruxolitinib then the subject  will be included in the safety 
analysis set .  
The full analysis set  will include all subjects  that are evaluable at 6 months as well as subjects  
who are considered a treatment failure (including deaths) prior to 6 months. Subjects  who drop 
out of the study prior to 6 months for reasons unrelated to treatment will be excluded from the full analysis set. 
Page 36 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333- 18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 The primary endpoint is complete and partial responses in skin and/or joint, as determined by 
2014 NIH Criteria (1) at 6 months from initiation of ruxolitinib without addition of any other 
systemic chronic GVHD treatment, relapse of the underlying disease, or death. The historical benchmark for ove rall response for steroid refractory sclerotic chronic GVHD is 25%  in a 
randomized phase II trial by [CONTACT_512874]., comparing imatinib and rituximab ( 15). In the trial by 
[CONTACT_512874]., a significant clinical response was defined as “[ADDRESS_761191] a 1 -point improvement in the  4-level 
P-ROM scale or a 2 -point improvement in the 7- level  scale without worsening elsewhere .” The 
Vienna Skin Score is different from the 2014 NIH criteria (1) for responses in skin and/or joint. According to the 2014 NIH guidelines (1), “b ecause the NIH 0 to 3 Skin Score is now  
recommended  for response assessment, even substantial improvement in sclerotic features will 
not be considered responses unless the  NIH Skin Score improves.” For this reason, for the 
purpose of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], responses will include complete and partial responses in skin and/or joint , at least a 2 -point improvement on 0- 10 semiquantitativ e scale for capturing 
clinician -perceived  severity of sclerosis , or clinically significant improvement (improvement by 
≥6 point)  on the skin subscale of the Lee symptom scale, consistent with the recommendations of 
the 2014 NIH Criteria (1). Additionally, improvement in percentage of BSA involved with deep 
sclerosis/fasciitis  will also be taken into consideration as a marker of responses. 
A two -stage design is planned to test the null hypothesis that the overall response rate p≤0.250 
versus the alternative that p≥0.450. T he first stage  will occur once  [ADDRESS_761192] completed 6 
months of treatment. I f only 4 or fewer out of the 18 subjects  respond at the end of  6 months of 
treatment , the trial will be stopped for futility. At stage two, an additional 24 subjects will be 
enrolled for a combined total of 42 from both stages. If  only 15 or fewer respond out of 42 
subjects at the end of stage two, then no further investigation is warranted. If 16 or more respond then further investigation is warranted. This design achieves 84% power with a significance level of 0.044. Retrospectiv e studies (31, 32, 40)  have demonstrated that ruxolitinib is well tolerate d 
and effective in patients with steroid -refractory chronic graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) in 
general and sclerotic GVHD. Therefore, the accrual will not be put on hold for interim analysis.  
To meet our statistical endpoints, a sample size of 42 is requi red; however, to account for 
dropout rate of approximately 10%, the study will dose  [ADDRESS_761193] deviation 
(SD), median and range will be reported for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages will be used to describe categorical variables.

UNMC IRB # 333- 18, Protocol Version 1.6 dated 25Jan2021 10.2.1 Efficacy Endpoints  
Primary and secondary objectives  
The pr imary objective of the study is to determine the complete and partial responses in skin 
and/or joint after  6 months of therapy. The response rate will be reported as a proportion and 
95% exact confidence interval.  This analysis will be conducted on the ful l analysis set . 
The secondary objective is to determine the overall complete and partial responses after  6 
months of therapy. The response rate will be reported as a proportion and 95% exact confidence 
interval.  
Exploratory Objectives  
Treatment failure (tr eatment failure defined as:  administration of additional systemic therapy for 
chronic GVHD, malignancy relapse or mortality) by 6 months from study enrollment.  
Time to treatment failure will be defined as study enrollment to failure event. Kaplan -Meier 
methods will be used to estimate the distribution for time to treatment failure. The failure rate at 
6 months will be estimated from the Kaplan -Meier curve, and the rate and 95% confidence 
interval will be reported.  
Time to non- relapse mortality will be computed as study enrollment to non- relapse death. 
Cumulative incidence methods will be used to estimate the distribution with relapses and relapse 
related deaths as competing events. The rate at 6 months will be estimated from the curve along with 95% confidence intervals.  
For subjects  treated on the extension study, the response rate at 12 months will be reported as a 
proportion and 95% exact confidence interval.  
For subjects  on steroids at baseline, we will explore the change in dose of steroids at [ADDRESS_761194]  along with a 95% CI. We 
will also determine the number and proportion of subjects  that had a dose reduction greater tha n 
50% as well as an exact 95% confidence interval . 
10.2.[ADDRESS_761195].  The incidence of treatment -emergent adverse 
events (new or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by [CONTACT_579430]. Listings of deaths, severe adverse events , and adverse events leading to early termination 
of study treatment or premature withdrawal from study will also be provided. 
10.2.[ADDRESS_761196] assumptions 
are met.  
Page 38 of 65 
UNMC IRB # 333-18, Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_761197]  individually as well as averages at each time point for responders and non-
responders separately. Univariate and multiple logistic regression will be used to determine i f the 
change in biomarker level from baseline to 3 and 6 months is predictive of responder status at 6 months, looking at the biomarkers individually as well as in combination. 
10.3 Accrual goal 
It is expected that 20 subjects  will be enrolled in the trial each year.  To meet the accrual goals of 
47, we require approximately 2.5 years of enrollment with 2 years of follow up.  
10.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_579408].  
The risk of treatment- related mortality is 10 -20% in patients with steroid refractory chronic 
GVHD (15, 42) . The study will have continuous mortality monitoring, and if ≥20% have 
treatment -related mortality that is possibly, probably or definitely related to the study drug, 
accrual will be halted (see stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144348]). Subjects , who are already enrolled in the study, 
and are tolerating the study drug may continue the drug at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  
Continuous monitoring (43) will be perf ormed after each subject  has received the first dose of 
ruxolitinib, beginning when the 2nd subject  has received the first dose of ruxolitinib, with K=47 
interim analyses, a null hypothesis mortality rate of 0.10, an alternative hypothesis of 0.20, and 
power of 0.80. The sample size is too small to control alpha and power simultaneously, so alpha is 0.19 to allow for 80% power (see below table for operating characteristics). The table below displays the boundaries b
k for each interim analysis k. If the observed number of treatment-
related mortality  is greater than b k, accrual will be terminated. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_579409] R package “clinfun” based on Ivanova (41), using this code: toxbdry(0.1 ,0.2, 3:47, cP0=0.1, cP1=0.8, priority="alt"). 
Continuous monitoring  boundar ies for K= 47 when the true mortali ty rate is 0.10 and the 
alternative hypothesis is 0.20 and alpha=0.05, 80% power

can enroll as early as 4 weeks after initiation of a new systemic immunosuppressant. 
Also, patients who are unable to tolerate current therapy can enroll any time after 
initiation of a new systemic immunosuppressant, as long as the “new” immunosuppressant is stopped in these cases prior to initiation of ruxolitinib. Initiation 
of any new topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588] (including FAM or intra-oral narrow-band UVB 
phototherapy) and changes in dose of existing immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, sirolimus, calcineurin inhibitors or other agents are acceptable at any 
time prior to enrollment. The use o f immunosuppressants for short term period, for 
example 7 days, for indications other than GVHD will be acceptable. ☐ ☐ ☐ 
15. Treatment with any other investigational agent, device, or procedure, within 21 days (or 
5 half- lives, whichever is greater)  ☐ ☐ ☐

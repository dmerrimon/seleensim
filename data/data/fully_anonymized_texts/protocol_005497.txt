CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Study Title  A prospective , Phase 3 , multi -center  single -arm, imaging study 
investigating the safety and diagnostic performance of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) 
PET ligand in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer  
Protocol Number  BED -PSMA -301 
Phase  3 
Sponsor  Blue Earth Diagnostic s 
Funding Organi zation  Blue Earth Diagnostics  Ltd 
Study Design  This is a Phase 3, multi -center, single -arm, diagnostic imaging study 
designed to evaluate the safety and diagnostic performance of radiohybrid 
prostate -specific membrane antigen (rhPSMA) -7.3 positron emission 
tomography (PET) ligand for the detection of N1 and M1 metastases in 
men with newly diagnosed unfavorable intermediate -, high - or very 
high -risk prostate cancer (PCa; per National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network [NCCN] Guidelines Version  1.2020 ; PROS -2). 
A number of measures have now been put in place to streamline the study 
for patient s’ safety due to  the continued impact of the Corona Virus 
Disease -19 (COVID -19) pandemic on daily life.  
Consented patients will be  screened to determine eligibility for the study 
up to 28 days  (up to 45 days due to the COVID -19 pandemic ) before 
investigational product (IP) administration . Alternatively, t his 
screening/eligibility evaluation may take  place on the day of rhPSMA -7.3 
(18F) administration  (with pre -screening via telephone) , if necessary , to 
ensure the safety of enrolled patients  (named “ Visit 1 and Visit  2 
combined ”). In addition to their  routine clinical work -up, which may 
include 99mtechnetium -biphosphonate bone scan and abdominal/pelvic 
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  and 
chest CT per local practice , and before the scheduled radical prostatectomy 
(RP)  and pelvic lymph node dissection  (PLND) , patients will receive 
8 mCi (296  MBq) ±  20% rhPSMA -7.3 (18F), delivered as an intravenous 
(IV) bolus injection, followed by [CONTACT_7816].  
For each patient, the PET imaging results will be reported to the 
responsible physician prior to the planned RP. If safe and feasible, within 
[ADDRESS_1021085]  return to the clinic for 
safety follow -up including electrocardiogram ( ECG), blood safety  
laboratory test s and  focused physical examination . Clinical review of 
imaging results and discussion of further procedures/treatments  with the 
patient should also take place at this visit  if the results are available . In 
cases  where the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET imaging results are not available at 
the safety follow -up visit, imaging results and further procedures/treatment 
plan should be discussed with  the patient within 7  days after rhPSMA -7.3 
(18F) imaging (this review may be conducted by [CONTACT_746407]’s 
discretion) . Within [ADDRESS_1021086]-IP administration, the patient will receive 
treatment as follows:  
• Standard of care s urgical treatment of PCa, including PLND ; or 
• If the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET scan detects M1 lesion(s):  
o A biopsy/sur gery and/or additional imaging to confirm  M1 
lesion(s) will be required  prior to initiation of treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  Safety will be monitored throughout the study. This will include adverse 
event ( AE) and vital signs monitoring, clinical laboratory evaluations, 
12-lead ECG and focused physical examinations performed in all patients . 
Note: due to the COVID -[ADDRESS_1021087] -IP safety follow -up 
(laboratory and ECG assessments  and focused physical examination ) may 
be co nducted within [ADDRESS_1021088] of  care treatment and follow -up procedures to confirm M1 
lesions(s)  by [CONTACT_746408] [ADDRESS_1021089] -IP administration.  
Study Rationale  The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) 
for detecting N1 and M1 disease in patients with newly diagnosed PCa 
eligible for curative intent, standard of care locoregional  therapy , who have 
elected to undergo RP with regional PLND . Accurate staging of newly 
diagnosed PCa assists in  directing appropriate treatment stra tegies. In 
patients with unfavo rable intermediate, high or very high risk PCa, the 
primary goal of imaging is to detect extra -prostatic disease. The 
identification of metastatic disease may significantly change the planned 
treatmen t regimen from locoregional to systemic therapy.  
The prostate -specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) receptor is 
over-expressed in the majority of  PCa. Although not approved in any 
country or region, PSMA PET tracers h ave been used in many center s 
around the world to image PCa patients. Initial results have demonstrated 
promising diagnostic performance. The variable production capacity of the 
radiometal 68Ga represents a practical disadvantage when considering the 
large number of patients with PCa  eligible to  undergo PSMA PET 
imaging. To overcome this shortcoming, 18F-label ed PSMA ligands, such 
as rhPSMA -7.3 (18F), have been developed. rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) inj ection is 
a PET ligand for the detection of PCa. The rhPSMA -7 (18F) isomer mixture 
and the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) stereoisomer have already been administered to 
patients at the Technical University of Munich  (TUM) . 
Evaluation of  the sensitivity and specificity of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) imaging 
by [CONTACT_746409] (BIE) for detecting  regional pelvic lymph 
node  (LN) involvement, compared to histo pathology , will be performed as 
the co-primary endpoint s.  
Primary Objective and 
Endpoint s Objective:  
To assess the sensitivity and 
specificity of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET 
in detecting N1 disease (as determined

pelvic lymphatic tissue removed 
during RP and PLND.  At least one 
positive pelvic LN on PET (N1) and 
one positive LN as determined by 
[CONTACT_26745] (pN1) on the same side 
of the pelvis ( left or right ) will be 
deemed a True Positive (TP) on a

Study Sites  This study will be conducted at up to approximately 35 sites in the United 
States  (US) and Europe . 
Investigational 
Product(s), including 
control products  IP: 8 mCi  (296 MBq ) ± 20% rhPSMA -7.3 (18F), delivered as an IV bolus 
injection with a [ADDRESS_1021090] 0.9% sodium chloride flush.  
Control:  Not applicable.  
Study and Participant 
Duration  Study Duration: The total study duration from first site activation to data 
analysis is estimated to be 15 months.  
Participant Duration : Will be approximately 90 days (assuming the longest 
possible participation). Patients will be screened for inclusion into the 
study up to 28 days  (up to 45 days due to the COVID -19 pandemic)  before 
IP administration. Each patient will have a safety visit within 1 to 3 days 
following IP administration  (due to the COVID -[ADDRESS_1021091] -IP administration).  Future study 
procedures such as surgery, biopsy or further imaging should be scheduled 
at this visit and based on the results of the PET scan  and standard of care . 
Patients will remain in the study until the results of the histology or 
confirmatory imaging are obtained in order to satisfy the Standard of Truth 
(SoT) . If confirmatory procedures for suspected M1 disease  are required, 
this should be prior to initiation of treatment . 
Study BED -PSMA -301, Protocol Version 3, 01-Jul-[ADDRESS_1021092] inclusion of 
sufficient numbers of histopathologically positive and negative N1 cases, 
an interim look will be allowed to ensure a distribution of pN1 disease as 
would be anticipated in this patient population.  
STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  The co-primary endpoint s for the study are based on the sensitivity and 
specificity of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET (as determined by [CONTACT_746411]) in 
detecting N1 disease compared to histopathology of pelvic LNs. The 
primary analysis involves a joint assessment of sensitivity and specificity 
against individual performance goals:  
H0: Sensitivity ≤ Se 0 or Specificity ≤ Sp 0 versus H1: Sensitivity >  Se0 
and Specificity > Sp 0 
Where Se 0 and Sp 0 are performance goals for sensitivity and specificity, 
respectively. Performance goals of 22.5% (Se 0) for sensitivity and 82.5% 
(Sp 0) for specificity were selected based on the low sensitivity but high 
specificity of other PSMA ligands used for LN staging. The analyses for 
sensitivity and specificity will be performed using one -sided 0.[ADDRESS_1021093] two -sided 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) will also be provided.  If the predefined sensitivity and 
specificity goals  are met by [CONTACT_746415] ( both tests reach 
statistical significance  for the same two readers) , the study will be 
considered to have successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the 
rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) in detecting N1 disease.  
Secondary and exploratory endpoints  will be summarized descriptively , 
with the exception of consistency of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) scan interpretation 
by [CONTACT_350573]. Two -sided 95% CIs will be presented, where applicable.  
Rationale for Number 
of Patients  A total sample size of approximately 375 patients is planned  in order to 
obtain 300 e valua ble patients  for analysis of the primary endpoint . 
Assuming a sensitivity of 40% of PSMA ligands for detecting N1 disease 
(based on the previous OSPREY study  [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] ), a sample size of 
75 positive cases provides 90% power to reject the performance goal of 
22.5%. Assuming a specificity of 90% for rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET, a 
sample size of 225 negative cases provides 90% power to reject the 
performance goal of 82.5%. Assuming the true prevalence rate of N1 
disease is 25% (Kleve čka, 2008; MSKCC , Nomogram; Internal Report: 
PSMA: TUM Data Report ), a sample size of [ADDRESS_1021094]  inclusion of sufficient numbers of histopathologically 
positive and negative cases, an interim look will be allowed to ensure a 
distribution of pN1 disease as would be anticipated in this patient 
population. After the inclusion of approximately 150 patients, the 
percentages of pN0 and pN1 will be monitored . If the percentage of pN1 
exceeds 35%, inclusion of very high -risk and/or high -risk patients will be 
suspended . If the percentage of pN1 is less than 15%, the inclusion of 
intermediate -risk patients will  be suspended.

It is designed to target the extracellular epi[INVESTIGATOR_350560] -specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA ) molecule and is administered as a single intravenous ( IV) bolus microdose  (i.e. the 
mass dose administered is less than 100  µg/patient).  
The molecular structure of the drug substance comprises a PSMA binding motif, a peptide 
spacer, an 18F-radiolabel ed silicon fluoride acceptor moiety and a gallium chelator complex 
(Figure  2).

1.1 Overview of Non -clinical Studies  
A non-clinical biodistribution and dosimetry stud y has been performed  (Internal Report: 
BEDPSMADEV002) , in which 100 pmol rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) (N=27) was  administered  IV to 
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) male mice . Animals were sacrificed at 10, 60, 
120, [ADDRESS_1021102] -administration , with u rine and blood samples collected 
immediately after sacrifice  and tissues h arvested and weighed for the measurement of 18F 
radioactivity. Human dosimetry was calculated by [CONTACT_746418].  The data demonstrated that for rhPSMA -7.3 (18F), the largest accumulation of 
radioactivity was in the kidney, splee n, lung, liver and heart . Clearance from the blood and 
clearance to the urine was rapid  for rhPSMA -7.3 (18F), but there was a relatively slow 
build -up of radioactivity in the kidney.  Using a 3.5 -hour bladder voiding interval, as 
recommended by [CONTACT_746419] (ICRP, 1992 ), the 
effective dose for humans extrapolated from the animal data was 21.7 µSv/MBq for 
rhPSMA -7.3 (18F). Using a 1.0 -hour bladder voiding interval, based on the time at which 
patients will be encouraged to void in the clinical setting , the effective dose for humans was 
12.8 µSv/MBq . Based on the se data, a n injection of 8 mCi (296  MBq) ± 20%  for a clini cal 
scan would result in a favo rable radiation effective dose of less than 5  mSv, assuming a 
1-hour voiding interval.

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  Consistent with the development of a radiodiagnostic agent, rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) is not 
designed to elicit pharmacological activity and an in vitro  secondary pharmacology screen 
has confirmed there is no unintended pharmacolo gical activity in a panel of 44  potential 
targets. A concentration of 5  µg/mL was used in the in vitro  pharmacology profiling which 
compares to a maximum concentration in human plasma of 0.04  µg/mL  (based on 2500  mL 
plasma and a maximum human dose of 100 µg) . In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_746404] -7.3 
at IV dosages of 0, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg, the no-observed -adverse -effect -level  was the 
maximum dose administered of 10 mg/kg (allometrically scaled h uman dose equivalent of 
1.6 mg/kg). This represents a 1000 -fold multiple of the maximum clinical microdose of 
100 µg based on a 60 kg human. No target organs of toxicity were identified. Systemic 
exposure demonstrated rat plasma concentrations above the intended maximum human actual 
dose. In vitro  protein binding in rat and human indicated moderate binding of 75 % and 82% 
in rat and human , respectively , with no concentration dependence. In vitro  human 
cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) reaction phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_746405] -7.3 is not metaboliz ed. In 
vitro  rhPSMA -7.3 does not inhibit or induce human CYP isoforms and is not a substrate or 
inhibitor of human drug transporters suggesting drug interaction with rhPSMA -7.3 is 
unlikely.  
Further details of the non -clinical studies performed with rhPSMA -7.3 or rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) 
are provided in the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) Investigator’s Brochure (IB) . 
1.2 Overview of Clinical Studies  
Although no PSMA -targeted imaging agents are licens ed as radiodiagnostic agents for use in 
either Europe or the [LOCATION_002] (US), they are widely used by [CONTACT_746420] 
(Rowe, 2018 ). This includes use of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) (single diastereoisomer ), as well as 
rhPSMA -7 (18F) (a mixture of four diastereoisomers, including rhPSMA -7.3 [18F]), at the 
Technical University of Munich (TUM) . To date, data for rhPSMA -7 (18F), administered 
under the physician’s personal responsibility, (exempt from a manufacturing authoriz ation as 
per Section 13, Subsection  2b of the German Medicinal Products Act ), have been reported . In 
a retrospective, non -interventional review of data from patients  (N=1 189) with known or 
suspected PCa who underwent a clinically indicated rhPSMA -7 (18F) PET/computed 
tomography ( CT) or PET/ magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scans at TUM , diagnostic 
performance, biodistribution and safety data for rhPSMA -7 (18F) were a nalyz ed (Internal 
Report: PSMA: TUM Data Report ). Data sources included hospi[INVESTIGATOR_746406], as well as routine follow -up data. Given the retrospective nature of the data 
collection, informed consent was not obtained from each individual patient; thus, routine 
clinical data included in the stud y database were totally anonymiz ed and only aggregated 
anonymi zed data from chart review w ere available for analysis.   
No clinical data on rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) diagnostic performance  are currently available; 
however, clinical data available for rhPSMA -7 (18F) are broadly expected to be consistent 
with that of the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) isomer alone. The single isomer product ( rhPSMA -7.3 
[18F]) is being developed as it is preferable to a diastereoisomer mix for the purposes of 
manufacturing control.  
A total of 1189  patients, with known or suspected PCa, underwent a clinically indicated 
rhPSMA -7 (18F) PET/CT or PET/MRI scan at TUM between 30  June 2017 and 30  June 2018. 
Based on the retrospective chart review , rhPSMA -7 (18F) was well -tolerated, with no safety 
concerns identified. A total of 58  consecutive patients with high risk PCa (defined by 
D’Amico , 1998 ) staged with rhPSMA -7 (18F) PET/CT or PET/MRI were analy zed. Results

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  were compared to histopathological findings (patient -based analysis; template region based 
analysis; right - versus left-based analysis). For the patient -based analysis, the sensitivity, 
specificity and accuracy of rhPSMA -7 (18F) PET were 72.2%, 92.5% and 86.2%, 
respectively. For morphological imaging, values were 50.0%, 72.5% and 65.5%, respectively. 
On receiver operating characteristic analyses, rhPSMA -7 (18F) PET performed statistically 
significantly better than morphological imaging in the patient -based analyses ( area under the 
curve  of 0.858 versus 0.649;  p=0.012). For the  template region -based and the right - versus 
left-based analysis, similar results were obtained with rhPSMA -7 (18F) PET compared to 
morphological imaging. These efficacy data demonstrated that rhPSMA -7 (18F) PET imaging 
is superior to morphological imaging for N -staging of primary high risk PC a. 
Furthermore, rhPSMA -7 (18F) PET imaging offers excellent detection rates in early 
biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy ( RP; 423/532  had positive findings 
on rhPSMA -7 (18F) PET/CT imaging , including 333/418 and 90/114 patients with and 
without pelvic lymph node dissection ( PLND ), respec tively, and 185/225 and 
238/307  patients with and without salvage external beam radiation therapy [ EBRT ], 
respectively ), as well as in early BCR after primary radiation therapy with curative intent 
(60/65 had positive findings on rhPSMA -7 (18F) PET/CT imaging).  
Further details of the clinical studies performed or planned for rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) are 
provided in the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) IB.

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  2 STUDY RATIONALE  
rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) injection  is a PET ligand for the detection of PCa. The rhPSMA -7 (18F) 
isomer mixture and the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) stereoisomer have already been administered to 
patients  at the TUM ( see Section 1.2). To date, several hundred patients with PCa have been 
imaged clinically  with rhPSMA (18F), which has informed the design of this proposed study. 
rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) is currently being  formally evaluated by [CONTACT_746421] a 
Phase  1, open label, study designed to assess the  safety, biodistribution and internal radiation 
dosimetry  of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) injection in healthy volunteers, and to assess safety and 
investigate the imaging characteristics in patients with PCa (Study  BED -PSMA -101; 
EudraCT No. 2018 -004703 -39).  
Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in men in the developed world and the third 
leading cause of death ( Jemal , 2011 ). It is most commonly diagnosed in men aged 65  years 
and over  and i n its early stages, it is largely asymptomatic, with tumors detected by 
[CONTACT_746422] -specific antigen (PSA) in peripheral blood. If 
detected early, and when the disease is organ confined, the 5 -year survival rate approaches 
100%.  
Accurate staging of newly diagnosed PCa assists in directing  appropriate treatment strategies. 
The recently updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN Guidelines 
Version  1.2020 ; PROS -2) recommend bone imaging and abdominal/pelvic imaging as the 
initial work -up in patients newly -diagnosed high - and very high -risk PCa, as well as in a 
subgroup of patients with unfavorable intermediate -risk PCa. The primary goal of such 
imaging is to detect extra -prostatic disease (M1: non -regional nodal in volvement, bone, or 
other sites  [UICC, TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours ]); the identification of which  
would likely significantly change the planned treatment regimen from locoregional to 
systemic therapy.  
Various retrospective studies have evaluated the utility of bone scans as a staging tool, with 
an incidence of bone metastases ranging from 3.5% ( Ito, 2013 ) or 6.4% ( De Nunzio , 2013 ) 
up to 20% ( Chong , 2014 ) reported in patients with intermediate - and high -risk PCa. A 
false -positive rate of these bone scans of 20%  has been reported ( Chong , 2014 ), with MRI 
proving no better at detecting  bone metastases . Specifically, a recent publi cation highlights 
the low probability of finding bone metastases on a staging MRI of the pelvis , with b one 
metastases identified in only  1.5% ( 57 of 3765 ) of cases  and only in those with 
intermediate - and high -risk PCa (Vargas , 2017 ). 
In the absence of confirmed M1 disease, PLND  at the time of RP is recommended to assess 
for nodal disease and predict patient outcome ( Moschini , 2016 ; Swanson , 2006 ). 
Furthermore, in cases where  disease  is limited to the prostate and regional lymph nodes ( LNs; 
N1 disease), removal of regional LN metastases is performed with curative intent. Similarly, 
diagnosis of M1 disease beyond the field of surgery or radiotherapy allows both the patient 
and clinician to make more informed decisions about appropriate adjuvant, often systemic, 
treatments ( Roach , 2018 ). Several methods to predict the absence or presence of M1 disease 
have been used with limited success, including nomograms, CT, MRI and PET imaging 
(Cagiannos , 2003 ; Schiavina , 2008 ; Park, 2015 ; Zarzour , 2017 ).  
With respect to the detection of N1 disease, a recent meta -analysis of [ADDRESS_1021103] 
metastases of only 56% ( Woo , 2018 ). PET using  11C-choline did not perform materially 
better, with a sensitivity of 59% for the detection of LN metastases ( Huang , 2018 ). A variety 
Study BED -PSMA -301, Protocol Version 3, 01-Jul-[ADDRESS_1021104] recently evaluated 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET or 18F-DCFPyL PSMA PET as a 
decision -making aid in the prediction of N1 disease ( Table  1). Although specificity was 
relatively high in these studies , the sensitivity compared to LN dissection and pathological 
examination was rather low, with point estimates ranging from 31 % to 71%.

The overwhelming need for improved imaging should focus on the identification of N1 and 
M1 disease, which may potentially have a meaningful impact on patient treatment and 
outcomes.  Ideally, a staging technique that detects extra -prostatic  disease should : 1) image 
the whole body, 2) not be limited to the skeleton, and 3) be both sensitive and specific for 
identifying PCa extent . 
The PSMA receptor is a 100  kD transmembrane glycoprotein that is over -expressed in the 
majority of  PCa (Israeli, 1994 ; Silver , 1997 ; Osborne , 2013 ). Peptidomimetic 
glu-ureido -based PSMA inhibitors , initially described in 2001 ( Kozikowski , 2001 ), bind to a 
carboxypeptidase active site on the extracellular motif of the PSMA receptor. Although not 
approved in any country or region, i n the last [ADDRESS_1021105] 
imaged patients using PSMA PET tracers based on this targeting technology ( Perera , 2016 ). 
Whilst these initial results have demonstrated promising diagnostic performa nce, there 
remains no licensed or approved PSMA PET imaging agents. Ongoing clinical use of these 
technologies is only through compassionate use and research protocols. The variable 
production capacity of the radiometal 68Ga represents a practical disadvantage when 
considering the large number of  patients with  PCa eligible to undergo PSMA PET imaging . 
To overcome this  shortcoming , 18F-label ed PSMA ligands have also been developed.  
This study is designed  to assess the performance of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) for detecting  N1 and 
M1 disease in patients with newly diagnosed PCa eligible  for curative intent, standard of care 
locoregional  therapy , who have elected  to undergo RP with regional PLND . Evaluation of the 
sensitivity and specificity of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) imaging  by [CONTACT_746423], compared to histopathology, will be performed as the co -primary 
endpoints . Therefore, only patients who choose to undergo RP and a PLND will be included 
in this study .

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  2.1 Risk -benefit Assessment  
2.1.1 Benefits  
As rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) represents approximately 39% of the rhPSMA -7 (18F) mixture, clinical 
data obtained to date with rhPSMA -7 (18F) are relevant to the understanding of 
rhPSMA -7.3 (18F). 
rhPSMA -7 (18F) has been shown to be an effective PET radiotracer and is considered an 
improvement over morphological imaging for staging of primary high -risk PCa in terms of 
diagnostic accuracy  (Internal Report: PSMA: TUM Data Report ). rhPSMA -7 (18F) PET also 
showed good detection rates in early BCR of PCa after RP or curative radiation therapy  
(Internal Report: PSMA: TUM Data Report ). The data compare favorably with those 
published for 68Ga-PSMA -11, the most widely used small -molecule inhibitor of PSMA used 
for PCa imaging ( Rowe, 2016 ). 
The rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET scans may provide further clinical information regarding the 
patient’s disease status that may not have been appreciated by [CONTACT_746424]. If such 
information arises, this will be reported back to the responsible clinician to help direct the 
patient’s further management. This may provide a direct benefit to the patient.  
2.1.[ADDRESS_1021106] transmission scan (when the PET 
scan is acquired on a PET/CT scanner). Intravenous injection carries a small risk of infection 
and hematoma.  
A non -clinical biodistribution and dosimetry study has been performed (see Section  1.1). 
Using a 1.0 -hour bladder voiding interval, based on the time at which patients will be 
encouraged to void in the clinical setting, the effective dose for humans extrapolated from the 
animal data was 12.8 µSv/MBq for rhPSMA -7.3 (18F). The administered activity in this study 
will be  8 mCi 296 MBq  ± 20%. Based on the results of the non -clinical study, this would 
result in an effective dose of less than 5 mSv. Full details are in the Study Imaging Manual. 
rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) is currently being formally evaluated by [CONTACT_746425] a 
Phase  1, open -label, study designed to assess the safety, biodistribution and internal radiation 
dosimetry of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) injection in healthy volunteers, and to assess safety and 
investigate the imaging characteristics in patients with PCa (Study  BED -PSMA -101; 
EudraCT No. 2018 -004703 -39). 
The maximum effective dose due to the CT transmission scan on a PET /CT scanner will vary 
from site -to-site, but as a guide a dose of [ADDRESS_1021107] acquisition will be in accordance with ALARA ( As Low As Reasonably Achievable ) 
principles. The estimated total dose of 12 mSv (PET and CT transmission scan) is in line with 
other comm on nuclear medicine procedures.  
Patients in whom  the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET shows M1 metastatic disease will be asked to 
undergo a biopsy or confirmatory imaging of the PET -positive lesion(s) to confirm the 
presence of a metastasis.  
A CT -guided biopsy may be required in these patients; mean  effective dose s of between 4. [ADDRESS_1021108]  been reported (Guberina, 2018 ) during CT -guided biopsies and is 
dependent on the organ region and CT -scanner generation.  A biopsy will cause discomfort 
and pain and may incidentally lead to complications, like prolonged bleeding at the site of the 
biopsy or infection.   
Study BED -PSMA -301, Protocol Version 3, 01-Jul-[ADDRESS_1021109] or PET (see 
Section  9.1.8 ). Examples of effective doses from such procedures are as follows: 
abdominal/pelvic CT , 6 to 8 mSv (McCollough, 2015 ); chest CT , 7 mSv  
(McCollough,  2015 ); 18F-sodium fluoride  PET, 8.9 mSv  (Beheshti, 2015 ). 
As with all imaging techniques , there is the risk t hat the PET scan may provide a False 
Positive image ( FP; giving the appearance of cancer) in sites where it is not present, due to 
other events in the body or False N egative ( FN; failing to detect a nidus of cancer). Thus , 
patients should continue to be reviewed and may require other investigations, to confirm scan 
findings.  
To date, rhPSMA -7 (18F) has been administered to over 1200 patients undergoing clinically 
indicated rhPSMA -7 (18F) PET/CT or PET/MRI scan in a single cent er (formal data available 
for 1189 patients). rhPSMA -7 (18F) was well tolerated in these patients, and adverse events 
(AEs) primarily related to the underlying tumor , with few serious adverse events ( SAEs ) and 
only three events with a possible causal association with rhPSMA -7 (18F). This is consistent 
with AE reporting for other PSMA agents in the literature (Literature Review of PSMA for 
the Detection and Management of Prostate Cancer, data on file). In addition, as of 
15 February 2 019, rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) has been administered at TUM, under the physician’s 
personal responsibility, to a total of 558 men with known or suspected PCa. Although 
35 patients had AEs or SAEs  within the 30 -day observation period, t here were  no reports of 
adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions  attributed to injection of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) 
(M Eiber , TUM ; personal communication).

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective  of the study  is to assess the  sensitivity and specificity of rhPSMA -7.3 
(18F) PET in detecting N1 disease (as determined by [CONTACT_746410]) on a patient level 
compared to the histopathology of pelvic lymphatic tissue removed during RP and PLND . At 
least one positive pelvic LN on PET (N1) and one positive LN as determined by 
[CONTACT_26745] (pN1) on the same side of the pelvis ( left or right ) will be deemed a True 
Positive  (TP) at the patient level.  In patients who have no TP regions (left or right ), the 
translation of varying combinations of F P, True Negative ( TN) and FN regions to patient 
level categorizations is described in detail in  Section  16.4. 
3.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
1. To assess the Verified Detection Rate (VDR) for M1 disease of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET

pelvic LN metastases compared to surgical pathology on a patient level in which a 
FN patient is defined as having at least one FN region ( right  or left pelvis), regardless of 
any coexisting TN findings.  
6. To assess the impact of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET BIE on a) upstaging patients planned for 
RP or b) converting planned RP to EBRT.  
7. To determine the inter - and intra -reader agreement of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) scan 
interpretation by [CONTACT_746414].  
8. To assess the safety of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) injection in patients.  
3.3 Exploratory Objectives  
The exploratory objectives of the study are:

information for the drug product. Only product for which confirmation of release has been 
received shall be used. Where the product is transported as a single patient dose, the dose will 
be measured in a radionuclide dose calibrator before administration. Where the product is 
transported in its original container the volume of injection for each patient is calculated and 
withdrawn into a shielded syringe immediately before injection. The calculation is based on the 
radioactive content, the half -life of 18F (109.8 mins), the reference date and time, the prescribed 
dose and the time of injection.  
8.4.1 Dispensing  
When the study site receives the dose and prior to administration, the activity in the syringe 
will be measured in a dose calibrator. Should the activity be less than  6.4 mCi (236 MBq) , the 
volume  required exceed 10  mL (US sites) or 6 mL (European sites) undiluted material or the 
IP be past the expi[INVESTIGATOR_267377], the scan should not be performed.  The dose can be 
diluted in the syringe to a maximum volume of 10  mL with 0.9% saline (as required).  After 
administration, residual radioactivity in the injection device shall be measured using a 
radionuclide dose calibrator.   
8.4.2 Administration Instructions  
Patients will receive a dose with an administered activity  of 8 mCi (296 MBq)  ± 20% of 
rhPSMA -7.3 (18F), delivered as an IV bolus injection with a [ADDRESS_1021124] 0.9% sodium chloride 
flush, followed by [CONTACT_7816] . Full details are provided in the Study Imaging Manual.

9.1.6 Diagnostic Imaging  
All patients will receive an IV bolus of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) injection and undergo a PET scan 
as described in the Study Imaging Manual.  
For each patient, the PET imaging results will be reported to the responsible physician prior 
to the planned RP. Within [ADDRESS_1021133] return to the 
clinic for  safety follow -up (may occur within [ADDRESS_1021134] -IP administration due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic) . Clinical review of imaging results and discussion of further 
procedures/treatments with the patient  should also take place at this visit if feasible . In cases 
where the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET imaging results are not available at the safety follow -up 
visit, imaging results and further procedures/treatment plan should be discussed with the 
patient  within 7  days after rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) imaging (this may be conducted by [CONTACT_746427]’s discretion) .  
Within [ADDRESS_1021135] -IP administration  (may be extended up to 60 days due to the COVID -19 
pandemic) , the pat ient will receive treatment:  
• Standard of care s urgical treatment of PCa, including a PLND; or 
• If the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET scan detects  M1 lesion(s):  
o A biopsy/surgery and/or additional imaging  to confirm  M1 lesion(s)  will be required  
prior to initiation of treatment.  
Image Interpretation  
Results of local rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET interpretation will be used to guide 
biopsy/confirmatory procedures , if indicated , as well as for the physician to discuss further 
procedures/treatments with the patient.  
For the evaluation of the co -primary endpoints, rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET image data will be 
appropriately blinded, randomized , and read by 3 trained, independent central PET readers.  
9.1.7 Biopsy/ Surgery  
If the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET shows M1 metastatic disease, the patient will be asked to 
undergo a biopsy or confirmatory imaging  of the PET -positive lesion(s) to confirm the 
presence of a metastasis. If a surgical intervention of this lesion  is carried out as part of the 
treatment, this may substitute for a biopsy. If the patient has proven M1 metastatic disease, 
the treatment decision may be altered, based on the responsible physician’s clinical 
judgement. This change will be documented on the eCRF.

physician believe, after obtaining the results of the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET, that EBRT would 
be a better therapeutic option than surgery , the patient may proceed to EBRT and the 
rationale for this change of management will be documented on the eCRF.  
The regional PLND must be performed by a suitably qualified surgeon and should include, at 
minimum, resection of lymphatic tissue for histological analysis from the following nodal 
groups: 1) hypogastric (internal iliac), 2) external iliac, and 3) obturator LNs. Extended LN 
dissection may be performed if clinically appropriate a nd the anatomical regions 
(e.g. pre-sacral, common iliac, peri -rectal) with left/right designations, should be recorded on 
the eCRF  (when collected, pre-sacral lymph nodes should be placed in a separate packet  from 
all other specimens  and labeled “pre -sacral”  prior to  pathology assessment ). Surgical 
procedures can be performed open, robotically, or laparoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897]. The location of the 
dissected material shall be marked in order to allow matching with  their anatomical origin 
(left and right pelvis); the left and the right side of the specimen shall be clearly marked. The 
dissected LNs will be sectioned and analyzed by a pathologist for the presence or absence of 
PCa according to standard of care at the clinical site. The anatomical origin of these pelvic 
LN samples will be correlated to rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET BIE to determine the sensitivity and 
specificity of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET for detecting pelvic LN metastases.  
At least one positive pelvic LN on PET (N1) and one positive LN as determined by 
[CONTACT_26745] (pN1) on the same side of the pelvis ( left or right ), as depi[INVESTIGATOR_583933]  2, will 
be deemed a TP on a patient level.  A detailed description of patient level categorizations for 
patients who have no TP regions ( left or right ) is provided in Section 16.4.

a. Histology of surgically removed pelvic LNs; 
b. Histology obtained by [CONTACT_158068] M1 lesion.  
2. Confirmatory Imaging  
Study BED -PSMA -301, Protocol Version 3, 01-Jul-2020  Page 40 of 66 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  a. In patients  without available histopathology, c onventional imaging is acceptable as 
proof of M1 disease in case of unequivocal findings (e.g. sclerotic bone lesions on 
CT, positive bone lesions on bone scan, evidently enlarged LNs radiologically 
considered metastases, lesions in the liver representing metastases as determined by 
[CONTACT_2207] , CT or MRI, multiple pulmonary nodules on CT ). 
b. Confirmatory imaging for proof of M1 disease will be read centrally. Three central 
reviewers will review all submitted imaging and reach consensus on the nature of 
the target lesion. Reads of the confirmatory imaging as SoT will be directed by 
[CONTACT_350596] -7.3 (18F) PET findings (for confirmation of lesion location only).  A brief 
summary of clinical information will be av ailable to the readers (e.g. 67 -year-old 
male with newly diagnosed, localized prostate cancer prior to rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) 
scan). Readers will be blinded to all other information. Further details are given in 
the study Independent Review Charter.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1021137] study visit . Duration (start and stop 
dates and times), severity/grade, outcome, treatment and relation ship to IP will be recorded 
on the eCRF.  Patients who experience an SAE (or an AE which developed within 3  days of 
IP administration and that persists at the final visit ) will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of these events is recorded.  
9.2 Clinical Laboratory Measurements  
Blood safety l aboratory tests, including hematology ( full blood count ), biochemistry (urea 
and electrolytes, liver function tests)  and coagulation , will be performed at baseline (pre -IP 
administration on the day of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) injection) and repeated at the safety follow -up 
visit within [ADDRESS_1021138]-IP administration  (may occur within [ADDRESS_1021139]-IP 
administration due to the COVID -19 pandemic) . Further details are provided in the Study 
Laboratory Manual.   
Any clinically significant changes  (as determined by [CONTACT_6962])  in clinical 
laboratory measurements should be reported as an AE.  
9.2.1 Hematology  
Blood  will be obtained and sent to a central laboratory ( Eurofins ) for a complete blood count 
(hemoglobin , hematocrit , red blood cell count, white blood cell count, white blood cell 
differential, and platelet count determinations ) for assessment of systemic evidence for 
infection and/or inflammation.   
9.2.2 Biochemistry  
Blood will be obtained and sent to central laboratory (Eurofins) for determination of serum 
sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, random glucose, blood urea nitrogen , creatinine, 
aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, 
direct bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase, albumin and lactate dehydrogenase . 
9.2.3 Coagulation  
Blood will be obtained and sent to central laboratory (Eurofins) for determination of 
prothrombin time , activa ted partial thromboplastin time and  international normalized  ratio .

Note s:  
a. in cases where the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET imaging results are not available at this 
visit,  the imaging results and further procedures/treatment plan  should be reviewed 
with the patient within  7 days after rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) imaging (this may be 
conducted by [CONTACT_746407]’s discretion) . 
b. to ensure patient safety due to the COVID -[ADDRESS_1021147] -IP safety follow -up 
(laboratory and ECG assessments and focused physical examination)  may be 
conducted within [ADDRESS_1021148] -IP administration.  
Study BED -PSMA -301, Protocol Version 3, 01-Jul-2020  Page 43 of 66 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  Patients will remain in the study until the results of the histology or confirmatory imaging are 
obtained in order to satisfy the SoT.  
10.5 Follow -up Procedures ( Within 45 Days after IP Administration])  
Within [ADDRESS_1021149] -IP administration patient should receive:  
• Standard of care s urgical treatment for PCa, including a PLND ; or 
• If the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET scan detects M1 lesion(s):  
o A biopsy/surgery  and/or additional imaging  to confirm  M1 lesion(s)  will be required  
prior to initiation of treatment.  
Note: due to the COVID -[ADDRESS_1021150] of care  
surgical treatment for PCa, biopsy/surgery and/or additional imaging to confirm M1 
lesion (s) may be extended  up to [ADDRESS_1021151]-IP administration.  
10.6 Early Withdrawal  
Patient participation in the study is entirely voluntary and patients may refuse to participate or 
withdraw from the trial, at any time, without prejudice to their future care.  
Although patients are not obliged to give a reason(s) for premature withdrawal, the 
investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting 
the patient’s rights.  
All withdrawals and dropouts of enrolled patients from the study should be reported and 
explained on the eCRF.  
Enrol lment will continue until at least [ADDRESS_1021152] 
completed all study procedures; therefore, dropouts who fail to complete all study procedures  
necessary f or the primary efficacy analysis , for reasons other than due to adverse 
reactions/AEs deemed related to IP, will be withdrawn from the study and replaced . No more 
than 15% of patients enrolled, wh o did not have M1 disease or EBRT, will be replaced (see 
Section  13.2).

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  11 IMAGING PROTOCOL  
11.1 PET Scanner  
A dedicated hybrid PET scanner (e.g. PET/CT) is mandatory. The selected PET scanner must 
be qualified by [CONTACT_289417]. Full details are in the Study Imaging Manual ( also 
referred to as the  Technical Operations Manual).  
11.2 rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) Injection Administration  
As rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) represents approximately 39% of rhPSMA -7 (18F), clinical data obtained 
with rhPSMA -7 (18F) are relevant to the understanding of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F). These clinical 
data are available from a retrospective study of 1189 patients who underwent rhPSMA -7 (18F) 
PET scans. Based on these data, it was concluded that use of moderate activities >8 to 
10 mCi (297 to 370 MBq) at an early imaging time point (50 to 70 minutes) is likely 
preferable for rhPSMA -7 (18F) in general use (see rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) IB ). 
A venous cannula will be inserted and the patient will receive an administered activity  not 
expected to exceed  8 mCi (296 MBq ) ± 20% of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) injection diluted up to 
10 mL. The administration will be injected via the cannula with arms down, as an IV bolus 
injection followed by 10 mL flush with normal saline solution. The participant will then be 
positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_55437], with the arms above the head (if possible), and will be 
scanned as described in the Study Imaging Manual.  The time from the end of injection of 
rhPSMA -7 (18F) to the start of imaging will be between 50  to 70 minutes.  
Full details are in the Study Imaging Manual.  
11.3 rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET Acquisition  
For the PET acquisition, patients will be imaged for approximately [ADDRESS_1021153] 
acquisition (if acquired on a PET/CT scanner), an unenhanced (no IV contrast) CT will be 
employed. Further details on the PET acquisition are given in the Study Imaging Manual.  
11.4 Image Transfer  
Following the completion of PET imaging at the study site, the scan data will be sent to the 
Invicro Imaging Core Lab (Invicro, LLC) using either the iPACS software or on physical 
media by [CONTACT_30367]. Full details are in the Study Imaging Manual.  
11.5 rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) Image Reads  
All local and central readers will undergo training in interpretation of rhPSMA -7 (18F) PET 
scans, and will have a training set available for reference. Primary evaluation and reporting of 
the PET scan will be based on the site -based local read (as per standard of care).  
Study BED -PSMA -301, Protocol Version 3, 01-Jul-[ADDRESS_1021154] a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable  and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with 
the administration of an IP, whether or not related to that IP. An unexpected AE is one of a 
type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) IB or of 
greater severity or frequency than expected based on the information in the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) 
IB. 
The i nvestigator will probe, via discussion with the patient , for the occurrence of AEs during 
each visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  Adverse events will be 
recorded in the patient eCRF.  Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop 
dates and times), severity /grade , outcome, treatment and relation ship to IP, or if unrelated, the 
cause.  
12.1.1  Severity  of Adverse Events  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 5 (2017) will be  used to assess and grade event severity, including laboratory 
abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The severity grading is provided below 
(Table  3).  
Table  3: CTCAE (V5) AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL *. 
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231320]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL**.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE  
ADL=activities of daily living; AE=adverse event; CTCAE=Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events . 
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managi ng money, etc.  
** Self-care ADL refer s to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.   
If the experience is not covered in the CTCAE  criteria, the guidelines shown in Table  4 
below will be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a 
measure of intensity and that a severe event is not necessarily serious.  
Study BED -PSMA -301, Protocol Version 3, 01-Jul-2020  Page 46 of 66 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  Table  4: AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention 
or therapy required. The patient  may be aware of the sign or symptom but 
tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_638437].  
Life-threatening (4)  The patient  is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it occurred. This 
does not refer to an experience that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe.  
Death (5)  Death related to AE  
AE=adverse event.  
12.1.2  Relationship of Adverse Events to IP 
The relationship of an AE to IP will be assessed using the guidelines  outlined  in Table  5. 
Table  5: Relationship of AEs to IP  
Relationship  to Drug  Comment  
Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_41833]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846].  
Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is unlikely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_11564] ’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_41847].  
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined to have no reasonable probability to have 
relationship to the IP. 
AE=adverse event ; IP=investigational product . 
12.2 Serious Adverse Event s (SAE s) 
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse experience  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869]  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Study BED -PSMA -301, Protocol Version 3, 01-Jul-2020  Page 47 of 66 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they jeopardize  the patient  or require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed  above .  
12.2.1  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to IP) on an SAE 
Report Form.  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed consent  is obtained 
and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.  
All SAEs must  be reported immediately (as soon as possible after the investigator becomes 
aware of the event but no later than 24 hours) by [CONTACT_746429]:  
For study sites in the [LOCATION_002]: [EMAIL_14259]  
For study sites in Europe: [EMAIL_14260]   
Additional and further requested information (follow -up or corrections to the original event) 
will be detailed on a new SAE Report Form and emailed to the same address.  
12.3 Urgent Safety Measures  
An urgent safety  measure is an action that the S ponsor and /or investigator may take in order 
to protect study participants against an immediate hazard to their health or safety (e.g., it is 
identified that there is a significant higher incidence of death at one investigator site and as a 
result recruitment is suspended at that site as an urgent safety measure ). 
An urgent safety measure taken by [CONTACT_746430]. For all urgent safety measures, the Institutional Review Board  (IRB)/Independent 
Ethics Committee ( IEC) and Regulatory Agency/Competent Authority will be notified in 
accordance with International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP ) and applicable regulations.  
Initial notification may be followed by [CONTACT_63664] a protocol amendment (see 
Section  18.2), notification of early termination of the trial within 15 days (if applicable) and 
notification of AEs and serious adverse reactions (if applicable).

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  13 DISCONTINUATION AND REPLACEMENT OF PATIENTS  
13.1 Discontinuation of IP 
Not applicable. rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) is administered as a single IV injection.  
13.2 Discontinuation /Withdrawal  from the Study  
Patients  are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time , for any reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without prejudice.  
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a patient  for any of the following reasons:   
• Significant non -compliance/protocol violation requiring discontinuation from the study.  
• If any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs 
such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interests of the 
patient.  
• If the patient meets any of the exclusion criteria (either newly developed or not 
previously recognized ) that precludes further study participation.  
• Lost to follow -up (see Section 13.4). 
• Sponsor request for early termination of study . 
The reason for patient  discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded  in the 
patient ’s source documents and  on the eCRF. 
Enrol lment will continue until at least [ADDRESS_1021155] 
completed all study procedures; therefore, dropouts who fail to complete all study 
procedures , for reasons other than due to adverse reactions/AEs  deemed related to IP, will be 
withdrawn and replaced. No more than 15% of patients enrolled, who did not have M1 
disease or EBRT, will be replaced.  
Note: Any patients who withdraw/are withdrawn due to adverse reactions to rhPSMA -7.3 
(18F) PET or AEs due to study procedures involved in rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET, will not be 
replaced.  
13.3 Replacement of Patient s 
Patients  who sign the informed consent form but do not receive the IP may be replaced.  
Patients  who sign the informed consent form and who receive the IP, but subsequently 
withdraw (or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study) will also be replaced except for 
patients who withdraw/are withdrawn due to adverse reactions to rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET or 
AEs due to study procedures involved in rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET  (see Section  13.2).

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  • The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_746432] a missed visit , 
and will counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, three  telephone calls 
and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s 
medical record or study file.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 
13.5 Study Discontinuation or Termination  
Patient enrolment may be temporarily halted or stopped if any of the following occur:  
• SAE of severe acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to the IP.  
• SAE of death attributed to the IP.  
• A new potential  safety signal, e.g. multiple severe AEs which are new to the current 
rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) risk profile.  
• Data from other clinical trials which greatly and negatively influence the current 
rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) benefit/risk assessment.  
Study BED -PSMA -301, Protocol Version 3, 01-Jul-[ADDRESS_1021157] to a significant degree 
the safety or physical or mental integrity of the study patients or the scientific value of the 
trial should be notified to the Sponsor within one working day.  
Protocol deviations for this study include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  (see Sections 0 and 6.2). 
• Use of a prohibited concomitant medication  (see Section 7.1). 
• IP administration but no subsequent PET scan.  
The Sponsor will determine if a protocol deviation will result in withdrawal of a patient. 
Major protocol deviations will be defined and documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan  
(SAP) , which will be written and approved before database lock .

Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed SAP will be written  and approved  
describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any modifications to the 
analysis plan described below.   
16.1 Data Sets Analyzed  
All enrolled patients:  all patients who signed the informed consent form.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS):  all patients who were  scheduled to receive  the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) 
injection by [CONTACT_350607]/exclusion  criteria.  
Full Safety Population ( FSP): all patients who received the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) injection.  
Efficacy Analysis  Population (EAP ): all patients who received rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) injection 
with a PET scan and who got through RP and PLND.  
Per Protocol Population (PP):  All evaluable patients in the EAP population .  
The primary analysis will be based on the EAP. The FSP will be used for all safety 
summaries.  
16.2 Accountability of Patients  and Imaging  
The completion status of all patients  will be summarized. Further, availability of results of 
patient  disease assessments, completion of visits, and information on image assessments 
performed will be reported.  
16.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
The following demographic variables at screening will be summarized : full/partial date of 
birth/a ge, gender, ethnicity/race, sex and height. W eight  at screening and on Day 1 will be 
summarized.  
Relevant medical history (including history of current disease, concomitant disease record, 
information regarding underlying diseases) at screening will be also be summarized . 
16.4 Analysis of Primary Endpoint (s) 
The co-primary endpoint s for the study are based on the sensitivity and specificity of 
rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET (by [CONTACT_746411]) in detecting N1 disease compared to histopathology 
of pelvic LNs. The primary analysis involves a joint assessment of sensitivity and specificity 
against individual performance goals:  
H0: Sensitivity ≤ Se 0 or Specificity ≤ Sp 0 versus H1: Sensitivity > Se 0 and Specificity 
> Sp0 
Where Se 0 and Sp 0 are performance goals for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. 
Performance goals of 22.5% (Se 0) for sensitivity and 82.5% (Sp 0) for specificity were 
selected based on the low sensitivity but high specificity of other PSMA ligands used for LN 
staging. The analyses for sensitivity and specificity will be performed using one -sided 0.[ADDRESS_1021158] two -sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
will also be provided.  If the predefined sensitivity and specificity goals  are met by [CONTACT_746433] (both tests reach statistical significance for the same two readers), the 
Study BED -PSMA -301, Protocol Version 3, 01-Jul-[ADDRESS_1021159] successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the 
rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) in detecting N1 disease.  
The TP, FP, TN and FN  region s will be categorized according to  Table  2 
(Section  9.1.7 ) using a right and left hemipelvis regional classification method . For the 
primary analysis, patients who have one TP region will be categorized as a TP patient.  
For patients  who have no TP regions,  Table  6a and Table  6b depi[INVESTIGATOR_21373] t he method for assigning 
patient level categorizations  based on by -region results  (i.e. for the different possible 
hemipelvis combinations of TN, FN and FP regions ).  
Two analyses will be performed based on the classification of patients with one TP region 
and one TN region. The primary analysis will include patients  as FN if the y only had one 
positive region by [CONTACT_746434].  Full diagnostic statistics will be 
provided for both patient level classifications.

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  Analysis of subgroups will be included in the SAP.  
16.5 Analysis of Secondary and Exploratory Endpoint (s) 
Secondary and exploratory endpoints will be summarized descriptively , with the exception of 
consistency of rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) scan interpretation by [CONTACT_746435] . Two -sided 95% CIs will be presented, where 
applicable.  
Further details will be provided in the SAP.  
16.6 Analysis of Safety Endpoint(s)  
Safety data will be summarized descriptively. For AEs and SAEs , the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) System Organ Class  and Preferred T erms will be used to 
code the reported events. The number of events, number of patients  with one or more event, 
and percentage of patients  with one or more event will be provided for all AEs, related A Es, 
SAEs, and all related SAEs.  For blood safety laboratory tests, vital signs  and [ADDRESS_1021160] 
inclusion of sufficient numbers of histologically positive and negative N1 cases  to power the 
co-primary endpoints, an interim look will be allowed to ensure a distribution of pN1 disease 
as would be anticipated in this patient population.  
16.8 Sample Size and Randomization  
A total sample size of approximately 375  patients is planned  in order to obtain 300 evaluable 
patients for analysis of the primary endpoint . Assuming a sensitivity of 40% of PSMA 
ligands for detecting N1 disease (based on the previous OSPREY  study  [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] ), a 
sample size of 75 positive cases provides 90% power to reject the performance goal of 
22.5%. Assuming a specificity of 90% for rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET, a sample size of 
225 negative cases provides 90% power to reject the performance goal of 82.5%. Assuming 
the true prevalence rate of N1 disease is 25% ( Kleve čka, 2008 ; MSKCC , Nomogram ; 
Internal Report: PSMA: TUM Data Report ), a sample size of [ADDRESS_1021161]  inclusion of sufficient numbers of histologically positive and negative cases, 
an interim look will be allowed to ensure a distribution of pN1 disease as would be 
anticipated in this patient population. After the inclusion of approximately 150 patients, the 
percentages of pN0 and pN1 will be monitored . If the percentage of pN1 exceeds 35%, 
inclusion of very  high-risk and/or high -risk patients will be suspended . If the percentage of 
pN1 is less than 15%, the inclusion of intermediate -risk patients will be suspended.  
Study BED -PSMA -301, Protocol Version 3, 01-Jul-[ADDRESS_1021162] all observations and other pertinent data on each of the site’s 
study patients. Particular care should be taken to ensure all data points are recorded in source 
documentation, especially those which are not part of standard practice. Source data should 
be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate and complete. Changes to source 
data should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry, and should be explained if 
necessary.   
Study personnel at each site will enter data from source documents corresponding to a 
patient ’s visit into the protocol -specific eCRF  when the information corresponding to that 
visit is available.   
Patients  will not be identified by [CONTACT_350609] (or designee), but will be identified by a site number, patient  
number a nd, where possible, patient initials.  Data are  pseudo -anonymized  as the patient can 
be identified and as such data remains personal data and within the scope of US, European 
and [LOCATION_006] law ( US HIPAA 1996;  European Union [ EU] General Data Protection Regulation 
[GDPR ] 2018 ; [LOCATION_006] Data  Protection Act 2018) . 
If a correction is required for an eCRF, the  time and date stamps track the person entering or 
updating eCRF data and creates an electronic audit trail.   
The i nvestigator is responsible for all information collected on patients  enrolled in this study.  
All data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed and verified for 
completeness and accuracy by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator.  A copy of the eCRF will remain at the 
investigator’s site at the completion of the study.

Sponsor ’s and designee ’s monitors and auditors, as well as the IRB/IEC and regulatory 
authorities to conduct on -site monitoring and/or auditing and provide direct access to all 
requested study -related  records . If on -site monitoring is not permitted due to restrictions 
imposed to maintain social distancing due to  the C OVID -19 pandemic , then the investigator 
will work remotely with the Sponsor and designee’s monitor to facilitate management of the 
study including review of study -related records.  
17.7 Patient  Confidentiality  
In order to maintain patient  confidentiality, only a site number, patient  number and , where 
possible , patient  initials will identify all study patients  on eCRFs and other documentation 
submitted to the Sponsor.  Additional patient  confidentiality issues (if applicable) are covered 
in the Clinical Study Agreement.  
To maintain confidentiality, all laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports and other 
records will be identified by a coded number and initials only.  All study records will be 
retained for 25 years in a locked file cabinet and code sheets linking a patient’s name [CONTACT_1639] a 
patient identification number will be stored separately in another locked file cabinet.   
Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the patient , except as

questions before  agreeing to participate.  
Patient s (and the patient ’s legally acceptable representative)  must be informed that 
participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without 
prejudice.  The rights and welfare of the patient s will be protected by [CONTACT_746438].  
Prior to the patient  undergoing any study -specific procedures, t he written informed consent 
form must be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_102] , or their legally acceptable 
representative, and by [CONTACT_28490]. The 
informed consent process will also be  documented in the source document (including the 
date/time  consent was obtained).  
If a patient  is unable to read or if a legally acceptable representative is unable to read, an 
impartial witness should be present during the entire informed consent discussion. The 
patient , or patient ’s legally acceptable representative, may orally consent to the patient ’s 
participation, if the patient , or patient ’s legally acceptable representative, is not capable of 
providing of signing and personally dating the consent form. Once the patient , or patient ’s 
legally acceptable representative, has provided consent, the witness should also sign and 
personally date the consent form. By [CONTACT_746439]/consent form /any other written information  was accurately explained to,

* Due to the COVID -[ADDRESS_1021177] baseline conventional imaging , Visit  1 and Visit 2 may be combined ( named “Visit 1 and Visit 2 combined” ) if judged by 
[CONTACT_350574] -CoV -[ADDRESS_1021178] with the patient is required prior to Day 1 to review the study eligibility criteria, obtain initial consen t (remote consent is acceptable  if permitted under local regulations 
and approvals ), to promote study visit compliance and to ensure patient understanding of the combined study visit and planned IP administration , as well as ask  about  baseline 
conventional imaging that may already have been performed or needs to be scheduled . Full written informed consent will be taken on Day 1 ( Visit 1 and Visit 2 combined).  For sites with 
on-site manufacturing, the visits may be combined if mutually agreed by [CONTACT_746441] -COVID -19 pandemic restrictions.  
Alternatively , the time from Visit 1 (initial screening ) to Visit 2 (rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET scan ) may be extended up to 45  days due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  
** Visit [ADDRESS_1021179]  return to the clinic for safety follow -up including ECG, blood safety 
laboratory tests and focused physical examination. C linical review of imaging results and discussion of further procedures/treatments with the patient should also take place at this visit, if 
feasible . In cases where the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET imaging results are not available at this visit, imaging results and further procedures/treatment plan should be discussed with the patient 
within 7  days after rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) imaging  (this may be conducted by [CONTACT_746407]’s discretion) . Patients will remain in the study until the results of the histology or 
confirmatory imaging are obtained in order to satisfy the SoT.  
Note: Due to the COVID -[ADDRESS_1021180] -IP safety follow -up (laboratory and ECG assessments and focused physical examination) may be conducted within [ADDRESS_1021181] -IP 
administration to ensure  the safety of enrolled patients . 
*** The p atient should receive treatment within 45 days (may be extended up to 60 days due to the COVID -19 pandemic)  post-IP administration, with treatment decision based on 
rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET imaging and conventional imaging  (see k below) . 
a  To include medical history and concomitant disease record, including a history of PCa, diagnosis date and prior PCa treatment s, as well as histological confirmation of  adenocarcinom a of 
the prostate . 
b  Pre-IP administration.  
c  Vital signs to be recorded pre -IP administration and post -IP administration.  
d  To be performed pre -IP administration.  
e  If not already performed  within 60 days prior to screening , conventional imaging will be performed as part of routine clinical practice, which may  include bone scan (99mTc-HDP, 
99mTc-MDP), abdominal/pelvic CT or MRI, and chest CT as per local practice).  Note: Conventional imaging that has been performed at non -participating institutions will be accepted 
provided the scans are retrievable and reviewed  by [CONTACT_30604].  Note: baseline conventional imaging performed as part of routine clinica l practice should be performed at 
least 24 hours prior to the  investigational  rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET scan.  
f  Baseline  blood safety  laboratory tests, including hematology (full blood count), biochemistry (urea and electrolytes, liver function tests) and coagulation  to be pe rformed pre -IP 
administration . 
g AEs will be monitored and recorded from the time of informed consent until the last study visit.

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP -MED -002-AD-2, Version 3  i To discuss imaging results and further procedures/treatments with the patient (all patients).  
j If rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET does not detect M1 disease , the patient will undergo the scheduled RP and PLND . In patients without M1 lesions identified  and in whom the patient and physician 
believe, after obtaining the results of the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET, that EBRT would be a better therapeutic option than RP, the patient may proceed to EBRT and the rationale for this ch ange 
of management will be documented on the eCRF.  
Patients in whom  the rhPSMA -7.3 (18F) PET shows M1 metastatic disease  will be asked to undergo a biopsy or confirmatory imaging of the PET-positive  lesion (s) to confirm the presence 
of a metastasis. If a surgical intervention of this lesion is carried out as part of the treatment, this may substitute for a biopsy. If the patient has proven M1 metastatic disease,  the treatment 
decision may be altered,  based on the responsible  physician’s clinical judgement. This change will be documented on the eCRF.  
k Any confirmatory procedure for suspected M1 disease, as described above, should be performed prior to initiation of treatment .

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common orthopedic procedures performed 1. Because the prevalence of arthritis is expected to grow substantially as the population ages [ADDRESS_841483]-operative pain management strategies can exacerbate these problems. For obese TKA patients, apnea is a real concern that systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_630656]. These are relevant concerns as the population receiving TKA are more and more likely to be elderly and/or overweight8, 9. New analgesic strategies are needed that can be used adjunctively to existing strategies with the potential to reduce reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_83269]. Several novel brain stimulation technologies including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are beginning to demonstrate promise as treatments for a variety of pain conditions [ADDRESS_841484] gastric by[CONTACT_630698]

Version 4, 05/08/2017  40% less patient-controlled opi[INVESTIGATOR_630657] 48-hour post-operative period, with lower pain ratings26, 27, 30. This series of studies was the first to demonstrate the potential of brain stimulation technology to be part of a standard post-operative pain-management strategy, however TMS is more complicated to deliver than tDCS, has more adverse events, and is more cumbersome in the post-operative setting. In two independent preliminary pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_630658]-operative PCA use by [CONTACT_45848] 46% while simultaneously reducing subjective pain ratings. Thus, a handful of preliminary studies have demonstrated the potential for brain stimulation techniques to adjunctively manage post-operative pain, but a more definitive trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy of tDCS using a more rigorous experimental design. Further more data is needed to determine optimal tDCS dosing parameters before tDCS will become a viable clinical intervention for post-operative pain across surgical specialties. Aim-1: Determine the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on post-operative pain, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) use, and post-surgical complications during the 48-hour post-operative period following total knee arthroplasty (TKA)or total hip arthroplasty (THA). Hypothesis 1: Real tDCS (over sensory/motor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices) will be associated with decreased PCA morphine-equivalent usage (primary outcome), decreased pain ratings (secondary outcome), and decreased post-operative complications compared to sham tDCS. Aim-2: Collect preliminary data regarding dose-dependent effects of tDCS on post-operative pain, PCA morphine-equivalent usage, and 6-month outcomes. Hypothesis 2a: The analgesic benefits of tDCS will be dose dependent such that one 20-minute post-operative tDCS session will be superior to sham, two sessions will be superior to one session, and four sessions will produce the largest analgesic effects in the present study. Hypothesis 2b: Patients receiving higher doses of real tDCS will evidence lower incidence (and dose) of 6-month opi[INVESTIGATOR_96185], reduced pain, and better quality of life.   B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE_________________________________________________________  Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common orthopedic procedures, and in [ADDRESS_841485]-operatively, and adequate postoperative pain control is an important factor in determining recovery time, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], and long-term surgical outcomes 4 5 6  Postoperative pain control: Opi[INVESTIGATOR_630659], however there are risks and problems associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] 31. Among the risks are the numerous potential side-effects including: respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], nausea and vomiting, addiction, cough suppression, mental clouding, sedation, itching of the skin and nose, and constipation. Many of the side-effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_630660]. Thus, new interventions that have the potential to reduce reliance on postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_630661]

Version 4, 05/08/2017  population (such as TMS and tDCS; see Preliminary Studies) need to be explored.  Recently, Alam et al32 evaluated the incidence of long- term analgesic use after low-risk surgery in adults not previously prescribed analgesics by [CONTACT_14664] a retrospective cohort study using linked, population-based data in Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 1997, through December 31, 2008. Patients were identified that were dispensed an opi[INVESTIGATOR_306610] 7 days of a short-stay, minor surgery and the risk of long-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_630662], defined as a prescription for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_306610] 60 days of the 1-year anniversary of the surgery. Among 391,139 opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-naive patients undergoing short-stay surgery, opi[INVESTIGATOR_630663] 7.1%. At 1 year from surgery, an increase in the use of oxycodone was found (from 5.4% within 7 days of surgery to 15.9% at 1 year). Patients receiving any opi[INVESTIGATOR_365857] 7 days of surgery were 44% more likely to become long-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_630664] [ADDRESS_841486]-surgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_630665] a potential contributing factor to rising incidence and risk of long-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], dependence and abuse. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps have been shown to be very effective in the management of postoperative pain. While the risk of PCA pump usage specifically and directly leading to future opi[INVESTIGATOR_630666] (1% 33), opi[INVESTIGATOR_630667] 34. In many cases, both patients and physicians worry about the potential for dependence and abuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], and this sometimes results in under-treatment of acute and chronic pain 33.   Several non-pharmacological approaches to modulating pain perception have been used successfully in postoperative populations. There is accumulating evidence that cognitive, relaxation, and hypnotic interventions can significantly reduce postoperative pain and recovery time [ADDRESS_841487]-operative pain (see preliminary studies section), it is prudent to ensure that the effect is real and to explore key basic parameters that may be related to optimizing it before expanding the procedure into managing pain from other surgical procedures. We have therefore chosen to use this study to extend and refine the technique using total knee arthroplasty (a group with which the investigative team has extensive experience), rather than to prematurely begin testing whether the effects generalize to other surgical populations. Pain and the Brain: Pain is a complex experience that has sensory-discriminatory, motivational-affective and cognitive-evaluative dimensions 45. Experimental and clinical fMRI findings suggest that parietal areas, including the primary somatosensory cortex, are mainly involved in the sensory-discriminative dimension of pain experience and frontolimbic networks are involved in the affective dimension 46 47. There is also evidence that the primary (SI) and secondary (SII) somatosensory cortices are involved in the temporal processing of pain experience. However, activation of SI tends to be limited to activation contralateral to the side of stimulation, whereas SII tends to demonstrate bilateral activation 47 48 49. When pain-relevant anxiety is manipulated experimentally, evidence emerges supporting the involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the affective dimension of pain 
  4 of  25 
Version 4, 05/08/[ADDRESS_841488] that cognitive effects on pain perception may involve genuine analgesia that is mediated by µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_630668] 59 and are associated with decreased activation of the thalamus, insula and anterior cingulate. These effects correlate with prefrontal cortex activation (where expectations, thoughts and belief-systems are believed to primarily operate in the brain 60). Thus, left prefrontal activation might result in similar analgesic effects, presumably by [CONTACT_630699]. Interestingly, there appears to be distinct laterality effects regarding dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Activation of the left DLPFC but deactivation of the right DLPFC tends to be associated with pain inhibition (as well as improvements in mood). 56, 57, 60. Minimally-invasive brain stimulation technology: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), involves the application of low-amplitude electric current to the scalp. A battery-powered current generator (capable of delivering up to 2 mA of constant current flow) is attached to two sponge electrodes. The sponge electrodes are then soaked in saline, applied to the scalp, and held in place by a non-conducting rubber montage. During tDCS, low amplitude direct currents penetrate the skull to enter the brain. Although there is substantial shunting of current at the scalp, sufficient current penetrates the brain to modify the transmembrane neuronal potential 74, [ADDRESS_841489] current does not directly induce action potentials, but rather, the current appears to modulate the spontaneous neuronal activity in a polarity-dependent fashion. Anodal tDCS applied over the cortex increases the excitability of the stimulated brain area, while cathodal tDCS applied over the same area decreases it 71 77 78. Anodal tDCS applied over the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_630669]-lasting increases in visual cortex excitability 79 80. Hence, tDCS is believed to deliver its effects by [CONTACT_630700], and while anodal stimulation generally increases excitability and cathodal stimulation generally reduces excitability, the direction of polarization depends somewhat on the orientation of axons and dendrites in the induced electrical field.  Minimally-invasive brain stimulation and pain perception: The first controlled laboratory study of motor tDCS was performed in only 8 healthy subjects who underwent quantitative sensory testing before and after cathodal, anodal, and sham tDCS sessions, performed in a random order 95. The active electrode was placed over the left M1 and the reference electrode above the right orbit. Cathodal tDCS lowered cold detection threshold, corresponding to a reduced sensitivity to A∂-fiber-mediated somatosensory inputs. No other change was observed. However, this result was not confirmed in a subsequent study with the same design but a larger series of subjects 96.   A third tDCS study was characterized by [CONTACT_2224] a unqiue tDCS design, called high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS; see preliminary studies section) 97. With this method, 4 cathodes are placed equidistant (7 cm) from each other and from the anode, which serves as the active electrode. This montage increases the spatial selectivity of the stimulation. Anodal HD-tDCS delivered to the left M1

Version 4, 05/08/[ADDRESS_841490] of anodal (but not of cathodal) tDCS in chronic pain, of either neuropathic or non-neuropathic origin 21, 79, 91. This observation could illustrate the respective influence of disease-related homeoplastic cortical plasticity and stimulation polarity on tDCS efficacy. In general, anodal tDCS tends to reproduce the main effect of high-frequency rTMS that is a decreased sensitivity to cold stimuli and a reduced susceptibility to cold pain. It is generally accepted that cortical excitability is reduced by [CONTACT_630701], respectively 78. Because high-frequency rTMS is thought to increase cortical excitability, the similarity between the effects of high-frequency rTMS and those of anodal tDCS on thermal sensation seems logical. Both methods likely activate some cortical neural circuits running through the precentral gyrus and involved in cold sensation processing. However, this simple approximation should be viewed with caution because, as mentioned above, it is difficult to take the effect on motor corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_630670] a general rule of action of a type of cortical stimulation. In addition, even if anodal stimulation is exciting and cathodal stimulation is inhibiting, the efficacy of the stimulation may depend partly on the orientation of the axons in the induced electrical field. Moreover, the site of induced biological effects is thought to locate under the active electrode because it is assumed that the other electrode is a reference. This assumption is probably wrong if we consider that in most of tDCS studies, the reference electrode is placed at the forehead or over the orbit, and thus quite close to the orbitofrontal cortex. In these cases, what is interpreted as the effect of anodal stimulation of M1 may be the effect of cathodal stimulation of orbitofrontal cortex.  Stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) may both reduce the perception of pain, but they likely do so via different mechanisms. In a recent study, pain thresholds to electrical stimulation were assessed in 20 healthy volunteers before and during anodal tDCS. Four conditions of stimulation were compared: M1, DLPFC, occipi[INVESTIGATOR_96067], and sham. Anodal tDCS of M1 increased both detection and pain thresholds, while stimulation of DLPFC increased pain thresholds only. The results suggested that 1) anodal stimulation of M1 but not DLPFC could induce analgesia by [CONTACT_630702] 2) stimulation of DLPFC could modulate the perception of pain via mechanisms independent of sensory perception 19. An adjunctive study with 22 healthy volunteers showed that anodal tDCS of the DLPFC (but not M1, occipi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or sham) could decrease the perception of unpleasantness and reduces emotional discomfort/pain while subjects viewed emotionally aversive images 20. Overall, we have accumulated considerable knowledge over the past few decades about the relationships between acute/post-surgical pain, pain management strategies, opi[INVESTIGATOR_630671], and brain responses to painful stimuli. Additionally, several new brain stimulation technologies have been introduced and tested, and when combined in a thoughtful way with our growing knowledge of pain processing in the brain, there is considerable evidence supporting their potential role in current pain management strategies. Much less attention has been paid to integrating brain stimulation technology into the post-operative setting which is unfortunate given the limits of currently available post-operative pain-management resources, the risks associated with current pain management strategies, and the sky-rocketing increase in opi[INVESTIGATOR_630672]. The present study builds on accumulating knowledge about pain processing in the brain and clinical efficacy data supporting brain stimulation for pain. This study will be the first randomized, double-blind, controlled dosing study of tDCS technology as an adjunctive pain management strategy for post-operative pain. Data from this trial will likely yield information regarding the feasibility and efficacy of tDCS as a post-operative pain-management approach. If the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_630673]-operative pain management strategy, this might change the way post-operative pain management is approached in the future. Findings from this study will be used to evaluate the 
  6 of  25 
Version 4, 05/08/2017  necessity for an even larger-scale, multi-site clinical trial of the technique, and to determine whether future investigations of tDCS across different surgical specialties might be warranted.  C. PRELIMINARY STUDIES___________________________________________________________________  Motor Cortex tDCS Laboratory Pain Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]: Twenty-four healthy, medication-free, adult volunteers (18 female; 6 male; 3 African American; 1 Asian; 20 Caucasian) with a mean age of 26.58 (SD=6.11; range 19 to 43) provided written informed consent to participate in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. Participants did not have depression, chronic pain, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], seizure-history, or implanted medical devices. Two participants were nicotine dependent smokers. Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) was conducted using the ATS thermode of the Medoc Pathway system (Medoc Advanced Medical Systems Ltd, NC, [LOCATION_003]) attached to the left volar forearm of each subject’s left arm ~[ADDRESS_841491]. The thermode heated or cooled (randomly-ordered) from 32ºC at the rate of 0.25ºC per second. Participants pressed a button to stop the thermode as soon as they detected any change in temperature (sensory threshold), when it reached the level considered to be painful (pain threshold), and when they could no longer tolerate the stimulus (pain tolerance). After [ADDRESS_841492] System was used to deliver 20 brief (0.75s) suprathreshold thermal stimuli (individual heat pain threshold plus 1.5ºC) to the left volar forearm of subjects at the rate of 1 stimulus every 1.5 seconds. During the 30-seconds of repeated stimulation, subjects continuously indicated their level of pain intensity using a dynamic computerized visual analogue scale (CVAS) controlled by [CONTACT_630703]. The CVAS recorded the position of the digital marker on the VAS each second. The mean of the pain ratings during the first 3-seconds and the last 3-seconds of the 30-second wind-up trial were examined to determine the amount of wind-up pain experienced by [CONTACT_20908].   The tDCS device was a Phoresor-II Auto (Model PM850, Iomed, Salt Lake City Utah, [LOCATION_003]). Participants were randomized to receive real or sham tDCS. For real tDCS, the device was ramped to 2 mA and maintained this current for 20 minutes. For sham tDCS, the device was ramped to 2 mA, but after 30 seconds, was ramped back down to 0 mA and stayed off for the remainder of the 20 minutes. During stimulation, participants rated the painfulness and unpleasantness of any scalp sensations using numeric rating scales (e.g., 0=no pain to 10=worst pain imaginable). Ratings were collected at stimulation onset, 5-minutes, 10-minutes, 15-minutes, and during the last 30-seconds of stimulation). Further, verbal descriptors of all scalp sensations, pain-related or otherwise, were recorded as well as all adverse events associated with the study. At the end of the study, participants were asked to guess whether they received real or sham tDCS. Further, they were asked to rate their confidence in their guess (0=completely guessing to 10=absolutely sure).  Participants rated the scalp pain associated with real tDCS as 1.98 (SD=2.02) out of 10 on average while those receiving sham tDCS rated their scalp pain as 0.18 (SD=0.27). These means are both low considering the 11-point range of the NRS, but they were significantly different (t(22)=2.94, p=.008). Participants receiving real tDCS rated the unpleasantness of the scalp sensations as 3.34 (SD=2.44) out of 10 on average whereas those receiving sham rated the unpleasantness as 0.43 (SD=0.49) on average (t(22)=3.88, p=.001). The scalp painfulness and unpleasantness ratings associated with real tDCS decreased over time during stimulation. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_630674], participants were not able to correctly guess whether they received real or sham stimulation at a rate better than chance (X2(1)=2.10, p=.21, ns). In the real stimulation group, 46% of participants guessed correctly (X2=.004, p=.94, ns) and in the sham group 18% guessed correctly (X2(1)=2.23, p=.14, ns). The average guess-confidence rating was 5.50 (SD=3.10) in the real tDCS group and 4.55 (SD=2.16) in the sham group (t(22)=0.86, p=.399, ns).

Version 4, 05/08/2017   Qualitative descriptors of the scalp sensations during tDCS included "itchiness" (21% of total sample), "tingling" (21%), "prickling" (13%), "pressure", "stinging", "uncomfortable", and "warm" (8% each). A total of [ADDRESS_841493]-stimulation side-effects.   Sensory Thresholds: There was a significant main effect for time (pre- to post- stimulation; F(1,166)=148.77, p<.0001) but no main effect for condition (real vs sham stimulation; F(1,26.4)=0.04, p=.85, ns) on heat sensory thresholds. The procedural pain covariate was not significant (F(1,21=4.16, ns). However the time X condition interaction was significant (F(1,166)=5.34, p=.02). Participants in the real stimulation group evidenced a 0.54ºC increase (estimated marginal mean after controlling for procedural painfulness) in heat sensory threshold pre- to post- stimulation, relative to the sham group. For cold sensory thresholds, there was also a significant main effect for time (F(1,165)=50.82, p<.0001) but not for condition (F(1,29)=1.64, p=.21, ns), but the time X condition interaction term was significant (F(1,165)=7.74, p=.006). The procedural pain covariate was not significant (F(1,21)=3.17, ns). Participants in the real stimulation group evidenced a 0.76ºC decrease (estimated marginal mean after controlling for procedural painfulness) in cold sensory threshold pre- to post- stimulation relative to sham.  Thermal Pain Thresholds: A main effect for time was observed on heat pain thresholds (F(1,260)=64.94, p<.0001), but no main effect was found for condition or for the time X condition interaction term (F(1,22.8)=0.48, p=.49, ns; F(1,260)=0.19, p=.66, ns). The procedural pain covariate was not significant (F(1,21)=0.21, ns). For cold pain thresholds, a significant main effect was found for time (F(259)=4.55, p=.03) but not condition (F(1,22.1)=2.82, p=.11, ns). Only a marginal effect was observed for the time X condition interaction term (F(1,259)=3.18, p=.07). The procedural pain covariate was not significant (F(1,21)=0.85, ns). Participants that received real stimulation evidenced a 0.82ºC decrease (estimated marginal mean after controlling for procedural painfulness) in cold pain threshold relative to sham.  Thermal Wind-up Pain: A significant time (pre- to post- stimulation) X condition (real versus sham stimulation) X wind-up pain slope interaction was observed (F(4,44)=5.43, p=.001). For those receiving real stimulation, the wind-up pain slope decreased by 0.25 CVAS pain-rating points-per-second (during the 30-second wind-up trial) following stimulation relative to baseline (t(21.8)=2.21, p=.036). However, in the sham stimulation group, there was no change in wind-up pain slope pre- to post- stimulation (t(30)=0.52, p=.61, ns). In our recent laboratory pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], real tDCS was associated with significantly decreased heat and cold sensory thresholds, decreased thermal wind-up pain, and a marginal analgesic effect for cold pain thresholds, all after controlling for procedural painfulness ratings. No significant effects were observed for heat pain thresholds. Similar studies using TMS suggest that stimulation of the motor cortex is associated with changes in heat and cold sensory thresholds as well as heat and cold pain thresholds 89, 98, 99. Using tDCS, Bachmann et al [ADDRESS_841494] explanation for the divergence between these findings and those from the present study, is the significant difference in the spatial profile of induced brain current flow. Craig et al found that the application of innocuous cold stimuli activates the human thermosensory cortex located in the contralateral insula 100. Painful heat and cold stimuli activated the contralateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), contralateral primary motor and sensory cortex (MI: primary motor cortex/SI: primary sensory cortex), bilateral secondary sensory cortex (SII: secondary sensory cortex)

Version 4, 05/08/[ADDRESS_841495]-Procedural Pain Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]: [ADDRESS_841496]- Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pain. Nineteen Caucasian females (mean age=37.2 StdErr=2.4) were enrolled. After ERCP, participants were randomly assigned to receive 20-minutes of tDCS with anode over the left-prefrontal cortex and cathode over the gut representation of the sensory cortex. No serious adverse events were associated with tDCS. Side-effects of tDCS were limited to tingling (42%), itching (47%) and mild stinging (11%) under the electrodes. Patients that received a single 20-minute dose of real tDCS used 22% less total hydromorphone than those that received sham at the end of the 24-hour inpatient post-procedural period (Cohen's d=.38). The slope of the cumulative PCA usage curve was significantly steeper in the sham tDCS group compared to real (t(355)=10.80, p<.0001). VAS pain scores suggested an arithmetic advantage for real tDCS compared to sham (not statistically significant likely due to limited power). Results from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_630675], well-tolerated, and may be able to reduce post-ERCP opi[INVESTIGATOR_630676].  tDCS Effects on Post-Total-Knee-Arthroplasty (TKA) Pain Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]: In a very recent preliminary pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_630677] 40 patients undergoing unilateral TKA to receive a total of 80 minutes of real (n=20) or sham tDCS (n=20) with the anode over the knee representation of the motor strip and cathode over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 20-minute tDCS treatments were delivered: 1) in the PACU, 2) 4 hours later, 3) the morning of post-operative day-1, and 4) the afternoon of post-operative day-1. VAS pain and mood ratings were collected every 4 hours following surgery provided that patients were awake. The slopes of the cumulative PCA usage curves were significantly different between groups, and those TKA in the real tDCS group used 44% less PCA dilaudid at 48-hours post-op (p=.007; Cohen’s d=1.0). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_630678], VAS ratings of pain-on-average were also significantly lower in the real tDCS group (t(37)=2.28, p=.029). No adverse events or serious adverse events were encountered. There were no cases in which tDCS needed to be discontinued due to patient discomfort or tDCS-related complications.  Overall, we have found that stimulating pain-modulating areas of the human cortex can significantly reduce post-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_630679], and in some cases, it can significantly decrease pain ratings even though patients use less opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Further, we observe large effect-sizes for 20-minutes of TMS and for 80-minutes of tDCS. The investigators have demonstrated the feasibility of, and expertise for conducting brain stimulation in the post-operative setting and these promising, preliminary findings of novel brain stimulation technologies suggest that future studies are warranted. The field of minimally-invasive brain stimulation for pain is expanding rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], but it is still in its infancy. tDCS appears to have the potential to serve as an adjunct to post-operative pain management strategies, but more studies are needed in this area employing larger-scale, well-controlled clinical trial designs to evaluate the specificity of tDCS dosing strategies and to begin to elucidate possible mechanisms of action.

Version 4, 05/08/2017  THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY (BDI) is a well-researched, brief, self-report depression screening instrument. It consists of 21-items that assess different aspects of depression (e.g., anhedonia, excessive guilt, suicidal ideation, vegetative symptoms, tearfulness). 103-108 IF ITEM #9 (SUICIDAL IDEATION) IS ENDORSED, PARTICIPANTS WILL UNDERGO A FACE-TO-FACE SELF-SAFETY SCREEN (I.E., INTERVIEW ASSESSING IDEATION, INTENT, PLAN, MEANS) AND A REFERRAL WILL BE MADE TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IF NECESSARY FOR FORMAL EVALUATION AND TREATMENT AS INDICATED. THE BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY (BAI) is a well-researched, brief self-report anxiety screening instrument. It consists of 21-items that assess different aspects of anxiety experience (e.g., physiological, cognitive, behavioral). 109  THE BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY (BPI) is a 17-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess chronic pain intensity and the impact of pain on general functioning, relationships and mood. 110, 111  THE MCGILL PAIN QUESTIONNAIRE (MPQ) is a 21-item self-report scale designed to capture the quality and intensity of the pain experience. 112, [ADDRESS_841498] a mark next to appropriate descriptors of their pain. The descriptors are assigned scores and the values load onto 4 factors: 1) Sensory, 2) Affective, 3) Evaluative, and 4) Miscellaneous.  VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) RATING SCALES anchored with "no pain" and "worst pain imaginable" will be collected twice daily during the inpatient stay to assess pain at its worst, pain at its least, pain on average, and pain 'right now'. Additionally, participants will rate pain "Unpleasantness" using VAS in order to assess the affective component of the pain experience. The same system will be used to assess changes in mood at its worst, mood at its best, mood on average and mood 'right now' but the anchors will be "extremely depressed, sad or agitated" and "extremely good mood." This VAS method of pain assessment was chosen because it can be administered numerous times each day and it is highly sensitive to changes in pain perception and mood. VAS ratings will be collected immediately prior to, during, and immediately following all physical therapy sessions (inpatient and outpatient) during the 3-month follow-up period.  DAILY PAIN DIARY: The diary will require participants to record their average pain rating, pain at its worst, pain at its least, Activity level, Mood, sleep from previous night, and the number of times prescription pain medications were taken that day. Participants will be asked to fill out this form each day at night for the first [ADDRESS_841499]-surgery. KNEE FLEXION MEASURE: A Gollehon Extendable Goniometer will be used to measure degrees of knee flexion at each post-operative physical rehabilitation visit.  POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS will be defined as any event, illness or postoperative occurrence that negatively impacts the health, well-being or functioning of the patients enrolled in the trial (including but not limited to headaches, confusion, delirium, nausea, vomiting, infections, and cardio-vascular complications). These events are tracked by [CONTACT_630705], and the information will be gathered and recorded in the research database as well as length-of-stay at the time of discharge.  PATIENT CONTROLLED ANALGESIA (PCA) PUMP [LOCATION_003]GE: After tDCS administration, patients will be started on a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. For statistical analyses of PCA pump usage, morphine-equivalent analgesic dose will be calculated (e.g., 0.2 mg of hydromorphone = 1.0 mg of morphine). Initial PCA settings will consist of hydromorphone 0.2mg/dose with a lockout interval of 10 minutes. The 4-hour maximum dose will be 4.8mgs with no continuous infusion. If a patient does not tolerate hydromorphone, the PCA medication can be changed to a different opi[INVESTIGATOR_630683]-equivalent dosing will be used. If pain is not adequately controlled, the patient will be reassessed by 
  11 of  25 
Version 4, 05/08/2017  study personnel prior to increasing the PCA dosing regimen. PCA pump usage will be downloaded from the PCA pump after discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT-FORM 36 HEALTH SURVEY (SF-36) is a 36-item measure of general health intended to capture quality of life, functional ability and well-being (mental and physical). The SF-[ADDRESS_841500] GUESS QUESTIONNAIRE will be used to determine how accurately patients, raters and tDCS operators were able to assess which treatment the patient received. This will assess our success in masking the sham treatments. Any time a guess-confidence rating is greater than 8 (on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_48105]-up with the participant and/or administrator in order to determine what factors contributed to this level confidence. If the guess is verified correct by [CONTACT_630706] (e.g., the participant or tDCS administrator reports that the he/she overheard the device-masking assistant discussing the device configuration, accidentally viewed the randomization codes, or felt/heard some unique tDCS-induced sensations that led them to correctly guess the condition), the participant will remain enrolled in the study (and no feedback will be provided to the administrator or participant regarding whether the guess was correct in order to avoid providing information that may further jeopardize the blind in later subjects). The participant's data will be dropped from analyses and steps will be taken to correct the mask procedure. Table 1.

Johnson VAMC, to be done either cemented or cementless, either computer-assisted or conventional. The anatomical approach will be decided-upon by [CONTACT_630707], but procedure type and device manufacturer information will be recorded to permit statistical control for different procedural and device implications on post-operative pain. Preoperatively, patients will receive sedation of up to 2 mg of midazolam and 100 micrograms of fentanyl for their comfort during regional anesthesia block placement. A peripheral femoral nerve block catheter will be placed utilizing sterile technique (chloroprep, sterile glove and drape) and femoral nerve stimulation (< 0.5mA) with or without under ultrasound guidance. A 20 ml bolus of  0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_630684]. The catheter will then be placed at a depth less than 5 cm passed the needle tip and secured to the skin using sterile occlussive dressings. The patient will also receive a single injection sciatic nerve block with a 20 ml bolus of 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_630685] (< 0.5 mA) with or without ultrasound guidance. Intraoperative management 
  12 of  25 
Version 4, 05/08/[ADDRESS_841501] or endotracheal intubation (isoflurane, fentanyl (up to 250 mcg) and succinylcholine or vecuronium).  Reversal of neuromuscular blockade will be performed with neostigmine and glycopyrolate as required.  Intra-articular injection of local anesthetics or opi[INVESTIGATOR_630686]. The patients will be started on the patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pump for pain. The PCA will be discontinued on post-operative day-2 at which time the patient will be transitioned to po pain medications (oxycodone). Surgery and anesthesia duration will be recorded and post-operative care will be standardized among all subjects as per standard VAMC clinical protocols. tDCS Electrode Placement: All participants will have an EEG 10-20 cap placed F3 will be marked with a non-toxic felt-tipped pen. The tDCS anode will be placed over the mark (see figure 8) and the cathode will be placed over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F4). Electrodes will be held in place with Velcro straps. tDCS Methods: tDCS will be delivered in four 20-minute-sessions (100 minutes total) and will be conducted with the Phoresor-II Auto (Model PM850, Iomed, Salt Lake City Utah, [LOCATION_003]) using 2mA current. This constant current device ramps up to the desired amplitude to minimize discomfort for participants and ramps the amplitude back to 0mA at the end of the programmed treatment duration. Electrodes will be standard small (4cm X 4cm) sponge electrodes soaked in a sterile solution of 0.9% sodium chloride insulated by a latex casing. The current density and total charge delivered by [CONTACT_589480]. A very low dose (0.125mL) of topi[INVESTIGATOR_630687] (6%) cream may be applied to the skin beneath the sponge electrodes for ~10 minutes and then removed if the participant experiences strong cutaneous sensations (patient report) during stimulation. After stimulation, a vitamin-E/Aloe cream will be applied to the skin under the electrodes following each treatment to reduce risks associated with skin drying.  tDCS Dosing: Custom-developed software will be used to generate random number sequences and save them in a file-format readable by [CONTACT_630708]. Participants will be randomized to one of four groups in order to assess the effects of total tDCS charge on post-operative pain.  Group1 will receive a total of four 20-minute sessions of active 2mA tDCS ([ADDRESS_841502]-  op day 0; and [ADDRESS_841503]-op day 1)  Group2: will receive a total of two 20-minute sessions of active 2mA tDCS ([ADDRESS_841504]-op day 0; and [ADDRESS_841505]-op day1) followed by 2 sessions of sham tDCS (both on  post-op day 1). Figure 8. Trajectory of anodal stimulation associated with the proposed tDCS electrode placement strategy 
 

  13 of  25 
Version 4, 05/08/2017   Group3: will receive a only one 20-minute session of active tDCS on post-op day 0, followed by   [CONTACT_630709] ([ADDRESS_841506]-op day 1).  Group4: will receive a total of four 20-minute sessions of sham tDCS ([ADDRESS_841507]-op day   0; and [ADDRESS_841508]-op day 1)  This dosing scheme will permit investigators to determine whether more stimulation over time is superior to less stimulation, as well as to determine the efficacy of motor tDCS in the management of perioperative pain. Blind Maintenance: To ensure blinding, specially-developed software will be utilized to switch the tDCS on and off without any intervention from the patient or experimenters. This will be controlled via a silent solid-state relay driven by [CONTACT_630710]218 (Ontario, Canada). For Sham tDCS sessions the stimulator will be turned off following 45s. The initial sham stimulation mimics the transient scalp sensation that is perceived when the stimulator is initially switched on. The order of treatment administration will be encoded in the software so that the administrator only enters a patient number and a session-number to start stimulation without knowing whether those specific numbers area associated with active or sham tDCS. The double-blind may only be broken if the clinical presentation of the patient suggests potential cognitive dysfunction, seizure activity, severe headache or extreme skin irritation under the electrodes. Procedures and Flow: After determining eligibility and interest, written informed consent will be obtained from participants in the Orthpaedic Surgery Pre-operative clinic. Participants will complete the screening questionnaires and all questions about the study procedures, risks, and benefits will be answered. On the day of surgery, the corresponding Admission questionnaires will be completed. After surgery, participants will be transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), awakened, and be hooked-up to standard clinical physiological monitors. Patients will be started on a PCA pump. Pain/mood ratings will be collected and the EEG 10-[ADDRESS_841509] with Velcro straps. The participant's study ID number and tDCS session number will be entered into the tDCS controller software, linked to the randomization file, and the stimulation session will begin (double-blind). After 20-minutes, the electrodes will be removed and pain/mood ratings will be collected again. Four hours later, the tDCS procedures will be repeated in the participants' hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223]. On post-op day-1, two tDCS sessions will be conducted separated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_841510]-surgical complications will be recorded. At all follow-up time-points, participants will complete the corresponding measures and opi[INVESTIGATOR_630688]. Statistical Analysis and Power: The orthopaedic surgeons at the Ralph H. Johnson VAMC conduct ~100 unilateral total knee arthroplasties and ~50 unilateral total hip arthroplasties each year . Thus, in order to meet the proposed n-size of the current study, 24 (out of 100) participants will need to be eligible and interested in participating in the trial each year. We will over recruit to permit for drop-outs and participants lost to follow-up. For analysis of primary outcomes associated with Aim-1, participants receiving any active tDCS (groups 1,2 & 3) will be collapsed and compared to the sham-only group. Multivariate multiple regression will be used with group-assignment entered into the model as a binary predictor. Surgery and anesthesia duration, depression & anxiety scores, sex, age, pre-tDCS pain, (ROM) Means and pre-op chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_630689]. Overall differences between real and 
  14 of  25 
Version 4, 05/08/2017  sham tDCS groups will then be examined for our primary outcomes: total post-op PCA morphine-equivalent dose, VAS pain-on-average ratings, and mean number of post-operative complications. Using the most conservative effect-size estimate from our series of pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (d=.70), with [ADDRESS_841511] (alpha=.016 (corrected for multiple DV's); 1-ß >.80; see figure 9). For Aim-2, MANCOVA will be conducted using all 4 groups and all primary dependent measures in the same model (controlling for surgery and anesthesia duration, depression & anxiety scores, pre-tDCS pain, physical rehab measures and chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_630690]). With four groups of [ADDRESS_841512] size f2(V)=.2, and alpha of .05, power is good detect significant main effects in the model (1-ß >.80). Secondary analyses will be conducted to evaluate long-term effects of tDCS on pain, functioning and quality of life (i.e., 2-wk, 4-wk, 8-wk, 3-month and 6 month-follow-up). Problems/Challenges/Potential Pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207]: The proposed tDCS device is an FDA-approved iontopohoresis device, and its use for tDCS applications is off-label. The tDCS procedure is minimal-risk and FDA-approval for tDCS applications using this device is not necessary. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_630691]-approval for conducting tDCS in the perioperative setting and thus there are limited concerns about receiving approval to conduct the proposed research at the Ralph H. Johnson VAMC. Competing Trials Locally or Nationally and Distinction: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_630692]-funded clinical trial of tDCS for post-operative pain at MUSC. However, that trial is focused on optimal cortical targets for stimulation (not dosing) and does not involve the veteran population. The proposed study will be on veterans and will focus on dose-dependent effects of tDCS on post-operative pain and post-surgical recovery. Impact on Clinical Practice and Future Studies: If positive, this high-quality clinical trial could shift the paradigm of post-operative pain management to take advantage of recent neuroscience developments. Findings from this study will be used to evaluate the necessity for a multi-site clinical trial, and to develop future cross-surgical-specialty studies. This study will be the first randomized, double-blind, controlled study of tDCS technology as an adjunctive pain management strategy for post-operative pain. Data from this trial will likely yield information regarding the feasibility and efficacy of tDCS as a post-operative pain-management approach. If the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_630673]-operative pain management strategy, this might change the way post-operative pain management is approached in the future. Findings from this study will be used to evaluate the necessity for an even larger-scale, multi-site clinical trial of the technique, and to determine whether future investigations of tDCS across different surgical specialties might be warranted.

Version 4, 05/08/2017   E. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS________________________________________________________  E.1. Risks to subjects Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics  Subjects will be 120 patients undergoing TKA and THA surgery at the Ralph H. Johnson VAMC.  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  1) Between the ages of 25 and 90 2) No implanted medical devices above the waist 3) Mentally capable of reading, writing, giving consent, and following instructions 4) Not pregnant 5) Cleared for and scheduled for TKA or THA surgery 6) No history of seizures 7) Not allergic to latex rubber  Sources of Material  Participants will be enrolled in the study during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_630682] [ADDRESS_841513]-operative pain appears to be moderate and therefore does not eliminate pain entirely. Nonetheless, if a participant experiences total analgesia via tDCS (which is believed to be an extremely unlikely occurrence as it has never been reported in any of the 1000+ participants who have received tDCS for pain control around the world), it is possible that they might not receive signals indicating over-extension or over-use of their knee(s) after surgery and might incur damage in the joint(s).  Safety in case of pregnancy:   Pregnant women will be excluded from the proposed research.  Risks regarding Confidentiality 
  16 of  25 
Version 4, 05/08/2017   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_351226]’ anonymity and confidentiality, there is always some minimal risk of people other than the study investigators gaining access to subjects’ information. Every effort will be made to ensure that subject information will be collected and stored in a manner that ensures the highest level of protection of confidentiality.   E.2. Adequacy of Procedures for Protecting and Minimizing Risk:  Recruitment and Informed Consent Patients scheduled to undergo TKA or THA surgery at the Ralph H. Johnson VAMC will be recruited during their pre-operative visit in the Orthopedic Surgery Clinic. A letter of invitation will be mailed to perspective participants whom medical staff on the study feel may be eligible to participate in the approved research. These prospective subjects that will receive letters will be identified through clinic referrals from the Ralph H. Johnson VA in Charleston, Sc. A HIPAA waiver of authorization will be on file with the IRB giving the research team permission send IRB approved generic letters of invitation to perspective participants. Written-informed consent will be obtained during this pre-op visit.  Protection against Risks There are [ADDRESS_841514] subjects from undue risk require discussion.  These include the procedures used to obtain informed consent, the procedures used to ensure confidentiality of the subjects’ data, and the procedures used to minimize possible risks associated with the laboratory procedures. Informed Consent. In the consent forms and discussions with an investigator, subjects are advised fully of the procedures to be used, the amount of time required of them, the research procedures that will be conducted, the possible risks and benefits of the procedures, their right to refuse participation in the study without prejudice, their right to terminate participation at any moment without prejudice, and the name [CONTACT_487929]. All subjects will be required to have capacity to consent. Confidentiality of Subjects’ Responses. In the informed consent form, subjects are told that the information they provide and all findings will be kept strictly confidential, with access limited to the research staff and the possible exception of state or federal regulatory personnel. No one but the project staff has access to the master list linking subjects’ names to code numbers, and all information obtained is coded.  The respective master lists are kept under strict lock and key.   Research Procedures. We have described above the potential risks of the research procedures. If the subject shows deterioration in their clinical status, we will stop him/her from proceeding in the study, and coordinate appropriate care with a physician at the Ralph H. Johnson VAMC.  Participation in the study will be treated as confidential, as will all records. We will protect the identity of our subjects by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_630693]’s locked office, to which only they have a key and by [CONTACT_630711].  Data and Safety Monitoring Board. [CONTACT_75931] will choose a group of faculty at the VAMC to monitor the data on a bi-annual basis with respect to subject safety issues throughout the award period.   E.3. Potential benefits of the proposed research to the subjects and others  Participants will receive little clinical benefit from participating in the study although if they are randomized to a real tDCS group, there is a chance that they will experience less pain than if they had been randomized to a sham group.

Version 4, 05/08/[ADDRESS_841515]-operative PCA use by [CONTACT_45848] 46% while simultaneously reducing subjective pain ratings. Thus, there appears to be potential analgesic effects of tDCS for post-procedural and post-operative pain. If it proves to be beneficial, this technique could revolutionize current methods for post-operative pain management.

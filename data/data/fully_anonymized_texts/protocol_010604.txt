Specific Aim:  
1. To define whether starting COCs in close succession (2d ays) following the administration of 
the anti -progestin, ulipristal acetate, interferes with its efficacy as an EC.   
2. To determine if differences exist between obese and normal BMI women in the 
pharmacokinetics of ulipristal acetate -based EC (pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299])  
 
Background  
 The availability of highly effective options for emergency contraception (EC) is critical for 
women wanting to avoid pregnancy following an act of unprotected intercourse.  An anti -progestin, 
ulipristal acetate (UPA; ellaTM), has emerged as one o f the most effective oral options1.  In vitro  
studies have shown that UPA binds to the genomic progesterone receptor (PGR) with high affinity2-5, 
leading to the theoretical clinical concern that using UPA in close succession with hormonal 
contraception may  adversely impact the effectiveness of either or both methods. A pharma -
sponsored trial under review for publication studied the impact of UPA on the ability of combined oral 
contraception (COC) to suppress ovulation.  Moreover, that study was not designed  to determine 
COC’s impact on UPA ( personal communication, S Cameron, 3/2015 ). This knowledge gap places 
women at further risk for unplanned pregnancy.  A woman choosing to take UPA and wanting to 
initiate a hormonal method can either (1) delay initiation of a hormonal contraception for 14 days or 
until her next menstrual cycle8,9 and continue to be at risk for pregnancy using a less effective barrier 
method or (2) immediately initiate the method and possibly decrease the effectiveness of UPA.  
Discussions during the CDC Working Group for US Selected Practice Guidelines for Contraceptive 
Use (Atlanta, GA 10/2011) as well as the recent WHO Medical Eligibility Steering committee meeting 
(2014) noted that this issue should be a priority in light of increasing U PA use.  
Our proposal has been designed to address this gap in knowledge and will focus on the impact 
of COCs on UPA’s main mechanism of action. Our hypothesis is that starting COCs  shortly after  
UPA use adversely impacts UPA’s ability to delay ovulation. Our primary aim is to  define whether 
starting COCs [ADDRESS_903117] commonly used hormonal methods.  
 Glasier et al11 demonstrates that there may be difference s in the effectiveness of UPA EC in 
women of varying BMIs. Drug therapeutics or how well a drug works is based on several key 
pharmacokinetic parameters – specifically for EC, maximum concentration and time to maximum 
concentration are considered critical.  We would like to perform a substudy within this proposal to 
obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_668621] a difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between obese 
and normal BMI women taking UPA -EC.  
 
Methods:  
Study design: Prospective cohort study. Women wil l act as their own controls.  
Study Population:  Women (total=3 4) of reproductive -age with a BMI of 18.5 -28 will be recruited from 
the Portland area. To account for screen f ails and dropouts , we plan to enroll up to 60.  Individuals 
will be recruited through  several different venues using IRB approved materials including flyers, 
internet recruiting, and the CWH website.  Individuals meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria for the

use of UPA -based EC is known current pregnancy but participants will also be exposed to COCs.  
Study inclusion and exclusion criteria include:  
 
Major inclusion criteria include:   
 Generally healthy women aged 18 to 35 with regular men ses (every 21 -35 days).  
 BMI of 18.[ADDRESS_903118] BMI >28  
 Proven ovulation with a screening serum progesterone of >3ng/mL  
 Willing to use condoms (if sexually activ e with a male partner), willing to not have sex 
with men  during the study, or  have had a tubal ligation (or have a partner who has had a 
vasectomy) or have a copper IUD.  
 
Major exclusion criteria include:   
 Known intolerance or allergy to any of the study medication  
 Known metabolic disorders including polycystic  ovarian syndrome or uncontrolled 
thyroid disorder  
 Overweight or obese BMI  (except for additional substudy group of 5 women)  
 Any CDC Medical eligibility criteria category 3 or 4 for COC use12.  
 Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or seeking pregnancy; recent (8 week ) use of hormonal 
contraception  
 Current use of drugs that interfere with metabolism of sex steroids  
 Smokers.  
 
General methods : Subjects will undergo a referent cycle (Cycle 1, UPA only), followed by a washout 
cycle (Cycle 2) and finally UPA with COC s dose d 2 days later  (Cycle 3, treatment cycle) (see Table 
1).  Due to the extensive number of visits, blood draws, and exams, the patients will be compensated 
for their time.  Subjects will either receive compensation through the Greenphire debit card system or  
as a check. During the referent and treatment cycles (Cycle 1 and 3, respectively), subjects will 
undergo every other day visits starting on cycle day 6 followed by [CONTACT_668624] 7 days once a 
dominant follicle measuring 15mm or greater in one di ameter is visualized.  At each visit, subjects will 
undergo blood sampling via a single venipuncture for P and LH levels and transvaginal 
ultrasonography (TUS).  Study medication will be dosed on the day a 15 mm follicle is visualized. 
Women will be given a single dose of 30 mg UPA orally in Cycle 1 or a single dose of 30 mg UPA 
orally followed 2 days later by a COC (0.150 mg levonorgestrel/30 μg of ethinyl estradiol) in Cycle 3. 
Prior to ingesting study medication, women will undergo urine pregnancy testing. Women can choose 
to continue the COC for the entire [ADDRESS_903119] any scheduled study visits.  Study end 
will be at the onset of menses (defined as  two consecutive days of spotting/bleeding).

Data Analysis &Sample Size:  
The primary outcome will be the difference in the proportion of women with a delay in follicular rupture 
up to 5 days (yes/no) between their referent and treatment cycles13. Follicle ruptur e will be defined as 
the disappearance or >50% reduction of size of the leading follicle.  Confirmation of ovulation will be 
supported by [CONTACT_668625] P levels. Demographics will be reported and descriptive statistics will be utilized 
to report LH and P levels [ mean (standard deviation], follicular diameter [median (range)], and cycle 
day [median (range)] on the day of UPA ingestion during the referent and treatment cycles.  
Additionally, inhibition of follicular rupture will be plotted by [CONTACT_668626] (no surge, st art of LH surge, or 
after LH peak; defined in Brache et al.13) for each cycle as well as mean LH and P levels over time 
and the time of treatment to follicular rupture.  
A sample size of 3 4 will achieve 82% power to detect a 15% difference in the proportio n of 
cycles that demonstrate at least a 5 -day delay in follicular rupture (yes/no) using a two -sided exact 
binomial test with a 5% significant level. We plan to recruit up to [ADDRESS_903120] 5 -days in 58% of cycles13. If COCs adversely impact UPA by 15% then UPA’s 
efficacy would be similar to that of a levonorgestrel -EC which would be clinically significant.   
 
Substudy: UPA  Pharmacokinetics  
Our control group (normal BMI) will be recruited from women enrolling in the main study. Up to [ADDRESS_903121] convenient for 
them.  The substudy will be performed over 1 visit but this visit will take approximately 3 hours to 
complete. During this visit, women will undergo serial blood sampling from a “single stick” 
venipu ncture or from an indwelling intravenous catheter – per the subject’s choice.  One tube (10mL) 
of venous blood will be collected at the following time intervals in conjunction with UPA ingestion (0, 
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 hours).  UPA will be ingested under f asting conditions and directly observed intake 
will occur.  Women volunteering for this substudy will be compensated for this additional time.  An 
additional [ADDRESS_903122] meet the main study’s eligibility criteria except 
for BMI and confirmed ovulatory status by P value.  Serial blood sampling will be timed to occur 
during the follicular phase of the obese participant’s menstrual cycle.

Protocol Version 2.13.2017  
 
 Page 5 of 8 Template Revised: 1.22.2014  Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics.  Reproductive -aged (18 -35 year old), ovulatory, 
healthy women with no contraindications to the study medications and not at risk for or seeking 
pregnancy will constitute the  target population for this study.  
 
Setting.  All enrollment and clinical evaluations will be performed at OHSU in Portland, Oregon.  
Serum samples will be prepared at OHSU and analyzed at the ONPRC Endocrine Core Laboratory 
under the direction of [CONTACT_668630] .  
 
Sources of Materials.  The sources of research material for the clinical portion of this proposal will be 
new specimens (blood) and ovarian ultrasound data obtained purely for this research protocol.  The 
study investigators and/or research as sistants/nurses will perform all study procedures.  
 
Potential Risks.   In regard to the UPA-based  emergency contraceptive used in this study, the only 
contraindication to this medication is current pregnancy (CDC 2013) and this is an exclusion criterion 
for study participation.  The use of EC can affect the timing and duration of a woman’s next menstrual 
period and very rarely can cause nausea  and/or headache . This information will be reviewed with 
participants and if necessary, an anti -emetic can be provide d.  For the COC utilized in the study, we 
will use a COC that is commercially available and screen women according to the CDC Medical 
eligibility for contraceptive use guidelines.  We plan to use these medications in accordance with 
FDA-labeling.   
 
Women m ay feel some pain when their blood is drawn through venipuncture or the use of an 
indwelling venous catheter but there is minimal risk involved.  There is a small chance the needle will 
cause bleeding, a bruise, or an infection.   
 
There are no known harmf ul effects of a transvaginal ultrasound.  Women may experience slight 
vaginal discomfort.  
 
Risk of pregnancy is always present in women who are sexually active.  Women who are not at risk 
for pregnancy due to the use of permanent contraception (male or fem ale), use of a copper IUD, or 
have a female partner will be eligible for the study.  Those women at potential risk of pregnancy will 
be asked to abstain or to use condoms for the duration of the study.   
 
Recruitment and Informed Consent.  Attempts to enrol l a diverse study population will be made 
through placement of IRB approved recruitment material  in the community, community outreach  such 
as receiving an emailed newsletter they have opted to receive, and through the availability of foreign 
language inter preters  and research staff . Women may also learn of the study through their routine 
visits in clinics or by [CONTACT_668627].  
 
Women will be screened for eligibility and if they meet the basic criteria and agree to participate, they 
will undergo informed w ritten consent. The protocols and consent will be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_668628].  Information we collect and create in order to conduct 
and oversee this research study will be stored in the Women’s Health Research Un it repository (IRB# 
6748) for possible future research.  
Protection Against Risk .  Confidentiality of personal health information will be maintained according to 
HIPAA requirements for research.  All subjects will receive a study number to which all subse quent 
data will refer.  Personal identifiers will not be on questionnaires, data, abstract sheets, or in the main

Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others . There are no direct benefits 
to study participants.  
 
Importance of Knowledge to be Gai ned. It is anticipated that the results from this study will determine 
whether close administration of a COC with UPA will inhibit the ability of UPA to function effectively as 
an EC. Since UPA works via its ability to serve as a PGR antagonist, the immedi ate administration of 
PGR agonists present in COCs will possibly increase the failure rate of UPA due to competing actions 
on PGR signaling. UPA effects include preventing or delaying the midcycle surge of LH that is critical 
for ovulation11 and the expres sion of progesterone (P) regulated genes in the ovulatory follicle 
necessary for its rupture2. Thus, it is necessary to establish whether the PGR agonists present in 
COCs will negate the ability of UPA to prevent the cellular processes crucial for ovulatio n and 
consequently fertilization. This information will be critical for determining when to initiate COCs in 
women seeking this form of birth control. In addition, our research team is one of only a very few 
studying molecular and associated clinical aspec ts of novel and established contraceptives  
We anticipate that the study results will provide evidence for direct clinical guidance regarding 
co-administration of COCs and UPA. We plan to disseminate the data through publication and 
presentations as well as  highlighting the results to relevant governmental entities (e.g., CDC) and 
interested parties (e.g., HRA Pharma).

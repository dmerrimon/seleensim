Donor selection 
criteria In the absence of an allele level matc hed (8/[ADDRESS_45422]) sibling 
or unrelated donor, all potential relate d haploidentical donors will be typed. 
(See algorithm in page 16). A haploidentical donor will share at least one haplotype with the patient. 
A haploidentical donor will be excluded if the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_43222]. 
Among several potential hapl oidentical donors, in orde r of priority: Matched 
CMV IgG serologic status between donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], ABO matched > 
minor ABO mismatch > major ABO mismatch, younger donor, male donor.  
Treatment plan Conditioning regimens: 
Myeloablative conditioning:  Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV daily for 4 days. Dose 
will be adjusted for estimated creatinine clearance (see SOP BMT-G-115). 
Busulfan IV dosing targeted for a daily total AUC 5300 mmol*min/L for [ADDRESS_45423]-CI of 2 or more. 
Chemotherapy may start on day -6 or -5 depending on admission day. 
Reduced intensity conditioning: Fludarab ine: 30 mg/m2 daily on days -6, -5, 
-4, -3 and -2. Dose will be adjusted for estimated creatinine clearance (see 
SOP BMT-G-115). Cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg/day on days -6, -5 and 
total body irradiation 200 cGy on day -1. 
Graft: 
Donor peripheral blood hematopoietic cells for a target yield of 5 x 10

CD34+ cells/kg, minimal accepted number is 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_43223], maximum accepted 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. 
GVHD prophylaxis: 
 Cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg IBW daily dose) will be given on days 
+3 and +[ADDRESS_45424]-transplant as an IV infusion over 1-2 hours (see BMT-

 Sirolimus (SIR) will be administered as a 9 mg oral loading dose on 
day +5, followed by [CONTACT_43249] 4 mg daily, target level 8 to 14 ng/ml. In the absence of acute GVHD, sirolimus taper will start on 
day +90 (+/- 10 days) and it is s uggested to finish by [CONTACT_4475] +180.  
 Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will st art on day +5 at a dose of 15 
mg/kg every 8 hours IV with the ma ximum daily dose not to exceed 3 
gm. MMF will be changed to PO when feasible and discontinued on day +35 (without taper) in the absence of acute GVHD. 
Growth factor support: 
G-CSF IV or SQ will start on da y +5, at 5 mcg/kg/day, until ANC > 
1,000/mm3 for 3 consecutive days. 
Supportive care: Will follow established SOP BMT G-132. Given higher fevers and potential 
risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS ) associated with the use of PBSC 
grafts, patients will be monitored fo r CRS and if present will be treated 
according to published guidelines. (Appendix B)

2. Background and rationale 
Hematopoietic cell transplantati on (HCT) from HLA identical re lated or unrelated donors or 
from umbilical cord blood units can cure ma lignant and non-malignant hematologic, immune 
and metabolic disorders. Major limitations for wi der use of HCT remain timely identification of 
suitable donors and risk of transpla nt related morbidity and mortality.  
Donor availability and race/ethnic background  The likelihood of finding an optimal donor varies with racial and ethni c background. According 
to data from the NMDP the highest probability  is among whites of European descent at 75%, 
with a much lower probability in ethnic minorities such as African Americans at 19% or 
Hispanics at 34%. Optimal cords are only found in a small proportion of patients, 17% for white Europeans, 1% for African Americans and 5% for Hispanics. By [CONTACT_43250]-blood units, a donor may be found in 90% of patients.
1 However, the use of 
suboptimal donors (mismatched adult or cord-blood units) is associated w ith a higher rate of 
complications (graft failure, graft vs. host diseas e, infection) and lower survival. Patients from 
ethnic/race minorities more frequently suffer this burden.2 In addition, once unrelated adult 
donors are identified, donor attrition decreases the number of  donors actually available and 
willing to donate. Donor attrition is more  common in donors from ethnic/race minorities.3 
We previously performed a comprehensive an alysis of unrelated donor searches (n=531) 
conducted for new HCT consult patients seen in the Moffitt BMT Program (March 2006 to 
December 2009). Among other major findings, this analysis demonstrated the following: (1) The 
likelihood of finding a suitable (7/8 or 8/8, i.e. single mismatch or full match at HLA-A, -B, -C, 
or –DRB1) unrelated donor was significantly dependent on race/ethnicity; all non-Caucasian 
groups had lower rates of successful donor identi fication. (2) Among those with a suitable donor, 
race/ethnicity remained a significant obstacle to actual HCT utilizati on. The other strongest 
factor in this domain was disease progression, which speaks to the adve rse impact of prolonged 
wait from donor search to transplant.4  
MCC Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] 
IRB # Pro00018316 
Version 6.0 
Version Date:  07/13/2018    7 These data speak to the need for prompt and successful donor identification for racial/ethnic 
minorities (hence the rationale for rapid identification of nearly universally available 
haploidentical donors), and also  support the overall feasibility of our planned trial: Non-
Caucasian groups made up 26% of our published c onsecutive series of unrelated donor searches, 
and current Moffitt BMT Program data suggests that figure has increased to 29%. With our current allogeneic HCT activity (approximately [ADDRESS_45427] pro cedures done per year, 
with approximately double that seen in initial consult – expected rate of attrition around 50% with current donor selection prac tices), 29% of these numbers w ould result in over [ADDRESS_45428] procedures per year (or > [ADDRESS_45429] consults). Our proposed 
study would be highly feasible under these terms, but would become even more feasible if the 
option of haploidentical transplant was implemented much earlier in the donor  search algorithm 
for minority groups. Importantly, increasing numbe rs of consults done in Puerto Rico are 
expected to continue to increase the proportion of minorities in our overall consultation and 
transplant populations.  
Haploidentical related donors 
HLA haplotypes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DR ) are tightly linked genes that are jointly 
inherited. A potential rela ted donor that shares one haplotype w ith the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (4/8 identical), 
usually a sibling, a parent or a ch ild is available in over 95% of patients. Haploidentical related 
donors in general, are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_43224], readily available and highly motivated to donate. Such 
donors can be selected at the time siblings are HLA typed and before an unrelated donor search 
is formally started. Furthermore, haploidenti cal related donors are av ailable for any patient 
independent of ethnic/racial background.
5 
Haploidentical Transplantation (HaploT)  The fundamental obstacle of crossing the HLA barrier in HaploT arises from the intense 
bidirectional responses from T- cells reacting to allogeneic HLA molecules resulting in 
overwhelmingly high incidence of GVHD and graft rejection.
[ADDRESS_45430] effective approach used 
to overcome these limitations was developed by [CONTACT_43251]. with the use of megadoses of 
CD34+ cells and profound T-cell depletion of the graft. Although effective at decreasing graft 
failure and facilitating engraftment, this stra tegy led to slow immune reconstitution and as a

replete HaploT emerged as an attractive option owing to the development of stronger and more 
effective GVHD-preventive strategies namely th e use of a short course of cyclophosphamide 
early after graft infusion.8,9  
George Santos demonstrated that a short c ourse of high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) soon 
after bone marrow transplantation in rodents targ eted and depleted donor and host alloreactive T-
cells.[ADDRESS_45431]. The John Hopkins and the Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Research Ce nter assessed the use of a non-myeloablative conditioning 
followed by [CONTACT_43252] (50 mg/kg days +3, +4) and mycophenolate mofetil/tacrolimus prophylaxis 
after a haploidentical marrow graft infusion in 210 patients with acute leukemia.  Engraftment was sustained at 87%; grade 2-4 aGVHD occu rred in 27% and cGVHD in 15%. Cumulative 
incidence of relapse and non-rela pse mortality (NRM) were 55% and 18% respectively. This low 
NRM was counterbalanced by a significant relapse rate in  this high risk population.
[ADDRESS_45432] been 
seen when peripheral blood stem cells are used  for transplantation (an overall observation that 
recapi[INVESTIGATOR_43225]).17-20 
A Treg-favoring GVHD prophylaxis 
Our group has previously shown that a siro limus (SIR) based GVHD prophylaxis leads to 
significantly less grade 2-[ADDRESS_45433] of care 
methotrexate/tacrolimus in adult recipi[INVESTIGATOR_43226]. The 
main benefit was in gastrointestinal GVHD. As  acute GVHD remains a signi ficant cause of early 
transplant associated morbidity and mortality, effective acute GVHD prevention is an important 
clinical goal. Furthermore, SIR-based GVHD prophylax is also led to a lower incidence of 
moderate-severe chronic GVHD.  Because ch ronic GVHD remains the main cause of late 
morbidity and mortality after HCT, this repres ents an advance on HCT. In addition, sirolimus 
treated patients had a significantly greater pr oportion of regulatory T ce lls (Treg) among the 
CD4+ cells in the peripheral blood, and isolated Treg were functional.21,22 
MCC Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] 
IRB # Pro00018316 
Version 6.0 
Version Date:  07/13/2018    9 Calcineurin-inhibitor (CNI) based GVHD prophylaxis has b een commonly used as GVHD 
prevention strategy on HaploT. However, CNI nega tively affect regulatory T-cells which appear 
to be critical to establish tole rance after HCT, in particular if using peripheral blood stem cell 
grafts. In contrast, SIR fosters post-transplantation Tr eg recovery which has been shown to be 
central in tolerance development after transplant ation. Besides its Treg promoting ability and its 
pleiotropic immunosuppressive prop erties, SIR has been shown to have an antiviral and 
antitumor activity.23 
Therefore, SIR-based GVHD proph ylaxis is a desirable approach after HaploT to further 
improve acute and chronic GVHD prevention and to facilitate tolerance. Recently, Cieri et al. 
published a clinical study on 40 patients using a sirolimus based approach, a myeloablative 
conditioning and peripheral blood stem cell grafts followed by [CONTACT_43253] y. In their hands, it was a safe 
and effective approach, with a ra pid recovery of T cell compartmen t and in particular of Tregs. 
In particular, the cumulative in cidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD in this trial was only 15%, 
while prior trials (using predominantly tacrol imus and MMF on the backbone of PTCy) have 
rather reported ≥ 40% grade II-IV acute GVHD when usi ng peripheral blood as graft source. 
This major difference in outcome forms the key rationale for our testi ng this regimen, and 
provides an estimated effect  size for powering our trial.[ADDRESS_45434] 
Clinical transplantation tolerance is broadl y defined as the absence of ongoing immunologic 
injury due to donor-recipi[INVESTIGATOR_43227] (IS). 
Clinical judgment does not accurately identify th e development of immune tolerance after HCT, 
and therefore IS taper and disc ontinuation is empi[INVESTIGATOR_43228]. In 
previous investigation, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_43221], and colleagues ex amined peripheral blood transcriptional markers 
in tolerant and non-tolerant HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_43229] # [ZIP_CODE] 
IRB # Pro00018316 
Version 6.0 
Version Date:  07/13/[ADDRESS_45435] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_43230], and 10 healthy control 
subjects. Comprehensive data on patient character istics, prior and current GVHD activity and IS 
therapy were collected. Periphera l blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from a single 
time point freshly obtained peripheral blood samp le to (1) characteri ze immune cell populations 
by [CONTACT_43254], and (2) extract RNA for micr oarray analysis using the Affymetrix Human 
U133 plus 2.[ADDRESS_45436] to sample co llection did not differ between the tolerant and 
non-tolerant groups (median 38.5 vs. 39.5 mont hs, p =0.97). There we re no significant 
differences between groups in tota l CD4+ T cells, total CD8+ T cells, αα or αβ CD8+ cells, 
memory or effector CD8+, regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+CD127low), total CD14+ 
monocytes, total CD19+ B cells, plamacytoid or monocytoid dendritic cell s, NK, or NKT cells. 
Significance analysis of microarray (SAM) was used  to identify genes differentially expressed 
between phenotypic groups. A final tolerance gene set included 281 probe sets  that distinguished 
the tolerant group from both non-to lerant and controls. A final non-tolerant gene set included 
122 probe sets that distinguished  non-tolerant patients from bot h the tolerant group and healthy 
controls. Functional Ontology Enrichment (Met aCore by [CONTACT_43255]) identified enriched process 
networks including NK cell cytotoxi city, antigen presentation, lym phocyte proliferation, and cell 
cycle and apoptosis. An accurate classifier (>90 % accuracy, correctly classifying 14/15 tolerant 
cases and 15/17 non-tolerant ca ses) was developed only utilizi ng [ADDRESS_45437], and can be used to develop a 
classifier with high degree of accura cy to identify tolerant patients.25 We now propose to use this 
technology to prospectively i nvestigate toleran ce development following PTCy/SIR/MMF 
therapy in the setting of HL A-haploidentical peripheral bl ood stem cell transplantation. 
Summary rationale:  
Racial/ethnic minorities suffer disparate access to tr ansplant, largely driven by [CONTACT_43256]. This represents a particular shortcoming of our current practices 
at Moffitt, given the diversity of our usual pa tient population seen for BMT consultation. This 
MCC Protocol # [ZIP_CODE]

Version 6.0 
Version Date:  07/13/[ADDRESS_45438], it also makes 
original investigation possible to optimize outco me of haploidentical transplantation. We will 
examine a novel GVHD prevention strategy to prevent morbidity and death associated with 
GVHD, and expand current scientific knowledge in this area through correla tive science focused 
on the immunobiology of GVHD and transplantation tolerance.

Version Date:  07/13/2018    18 b. Peripheral Blood Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 
On day 0, patients will receive a peripher al blood hematopoietic cell graft. Donor 
peripheral blood hematopoietic cells will be harvested for a target yield of 5 x 106 CD34+ 
cells/kg, maximum accepted number is 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg,  minimal accepted 
number is 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_43223]. Total amount of T-cells in the graft will 
be noted. 
c. GVHD prophylaxis 
1. Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IBW daily dose will be given on days +3 and +[ADDRESS_45446]-cyclophosphamide 
according to MCC guidelines (BMT-G-119).  
2. Sirolimus (SIR) will be administered as a 9 mg oral loading dose on day +5, 
followed by [CONTACT_43249]. SIR levels will be monitored and maintenance dosing 
adjusted as needed for a target tr ough level 8 to 14 ng/ml, per Moffitt BMT 
program standard practice (BMT SOP #103). In the absence of acute GVHD, sirolimus taper will start on day +90 (+/- 10 days) and it is suggested to  finish by 
[CONTACT_4475] +180. 
3. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will start on da y +5 at a dose of 15 mg/kg every 8 
hours IV with the maximum daily dose not  to exceed 3 gm. MMF will be changed 
to PO and discontinued on day +35 (without taper) in the absence of acute GVHD. 
d. Growth factor support 
G-CSF will be given beginning on day 5 at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day (rounding to the 
nearest vial dose), until absolute granulocyte count (ANC) is > 1,000/mm
3 for three 
consecutive days. G-CSF may be given IV or subcutaneously.

Supportive care, including management of Non- infectious fever, transfusion, infection 
prevention, and nutritional support will be ma naged according to established SOP BMT 
G-132. As the proportion of T-cells in a pe ripheral blood graft may be 5 to 10 times 
higher than in bone marrow, there is evidence suggesting that higher fever and possibly 
cytokine release syndrome (CRS)  may happen in these patients shortly (hours to a few 
days) after graft infusion.29 Patients will be monitored for CRS and may be treated with 
tocilizumab according to published guidelines. (Please see appendix B). 
 
7.  Data collection and safety monitoring 
Procedures on this trial will follow the Data & Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) adopted by [CONTACT_941] 
H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institu te. This ensures that all clinical research 
conducted or coordinated by [CONTACT_43258], responsibly 
managed, appropriately reported a nd protects the rights and welfare of human participants. The 
methods and amount of monitoring required are dictated by [CONTACT_43259]. Other entities that will assume 
responsibility for data and safety monitoring include: Principal Investigators (PI); Scientific Review Committee (SRC); Protocol Monitori ng Committee (PMC); Research Compliance 
Division (RCD) of the Cancer Center’s Corporate Compliance Office; Institutional Review Board (IRB). Full details of this DSMP are provided in Appendix A.

Version Date:  07/13/2018    23 9. Statistical considerations 
The primary objective of this single-arm phase II tr ial is to estimate the cumulative incidence of 
grade II-IV acute GVHD by [CONTACT_4475] 100 after transplanta tion. The historical benchmark for grade II-
IV acute GVHD in this setting (related haploidentical transplantation, pe ripheral blood stem cell 
graft, conventional immune s uppression prophylaxis including PTCy, tacrolimus and MMF) is ≥ 
40%. The preliminary data from Cieri and coll eagues suggests that a novel approach (above 
treatment program, but use of sirolimus and MM F) results in only 15% grade II-IV acute GVHD 
by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_45451] > 90% power 
(α = 0.1) to demonstrate a reduction from 40% to 20% in our trial. With an anticipated accrual of 
1-[ADDRESS_45452] model. 
Rates of other complications will be estim ated with allied confidence interval.  
 
10. Tolerance biomarker assessment 
Sample collection: Research blood samples will be drawn at day 21, day 90, and day [ADDRESS_45453]. These time points  are highly feasible, and chosen fo r the following reasons: (1) The day 
MCC Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] 
IRB # Pro00018316 
Version 6.0 
Version Date:  07/13/[ADDRESS_45454] time 
points. (2) The inclusion of both day 21 and da y 90 samples permits a secondary approach of 
examining change in gene expression from day 21 to 90 as a predictor of subsequent tolerant vs. 
not tolerant phenotype; we expect this will be highly informative of evolution of tolerance 
mechanisms over time. (3) These single time point  samples are also positioned for prediction of 
GVHD syndromes as major clinical  indicator of alloreactivity. Day 21 samples will predate the 
majority of acute GVHD events, and day 90 is ideal for predictive analyses for development of chronic GVHD. Finally, the day 180 sample should cap ture the majority of subjects at time of 
immune suppression discontinuation. This sample will be used as predictor at time of immune 
suppression stop for subsequent sustained tolerance vs. development of GVHD after immune 
suppression discontinuation. Sample characteristics:   10mL peripheral blood will be drawn at 
each time point. Based on expected yield of 0.5-1ug RNA/mL whole blood, total RNA isolated 
will be more than sufficient for planned mRNA  profiling. RNA will be isolated (total RNA, 
inclusive of small RNA to permit future micr oRNA studies), and RNA integrity confirmed. 
 Clinical phenotypes:  The tolerant phenotype of interest in  the primary analysis (inclusive of 
both single time-point prediction and longitudina l change) is immune tolerance as defined by 
[CONTACT_43260]. In contrast, non-tolerant is  defined by [CONTACT_5640]/both continued IS  or GVHD. As secondary objectives 
day 21 and day 90 samples will be examined for prediction of alloreactiv ity (acute and chronic 
MCC Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] 
IRB # Pro00018316 
Version 6.0 
Version Date:  07/13/2018    25 GVHD, respectively). Definitions of acute and chronic GVHD will follow standard consensus 
criteria.26,[ADDRESS_45455] (PASS software) to 
estimate the require d sample size for the initial discovery cohort. We exa mined power according to 
the proportion of differentially expressed probe sets at  an effect size of 2 wi th a false discovery rate 
of 10%. With n=15 vs. n=[ADDRESS_45456] > 90% pow er to detect 
differential expression of as low as 1% of the to tal probe sets tested. As  our prior SAM two-group 
comparison ( see preliminary data ) showed n=655 (~1% of total probes) diff erentially expressed, 
n=30 will be used for discovery.   
 
We will identify differentially expressed genes that  distinguish tolerant vs. non-tolerant patients 
using microarray (Affymetrix Human U133 plus  2.0 array). Scanned output files will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_43261]-array average analysis (RMA).
30 The Significance Analysis of 
Microarrays (SAM) technique will be employed to identify differentially expressed genes between groups,
31 using 10% FDR, and ≥ 1.5 fold difference in mean expression values. 
Functional Ontology Enrichment (MetaCore by [CONTACT_43262]) with 5% FDR filte r will be used to 
identify enriched pathways and cellular proces s networks. We will conf irm candidate markers 
identified using NanoString nCounter technology.

Version Date:  07/13/2018    26 Investigate longitudinal change in transcriptional markers for prediction of immune 
tolerance development    
Approach: We will employ linear models for microarra y data with a FDR of 10% for this 
analysis examining change in gene expression (d ay 21 to day 90) to subsequent tolerant vs. non-
tolerant phenotype.32,[ADDRESS_45457] modeling to identify genes with longitudinally different change between groups. A 
predictive model based on genes identified above  will be developed using the machine learning 
technique, including the PCA method and support vector machine. The final predictive model 
will take into account both the identified gene sign ature, and also significan t clinical variables.  
  
Examine predictive markers of acute and chronic GVHD 
 
Approach: We will study day 21 and day 90 samples for prediction of acute and chronic 
GVHD, respectively. This will provide key information for the following: (1) Differentially 
expressed genes predictive of GVHD will be compared to those segregating the ultimate tolerant and non-tolerant phenotype to addr ess the extent to which the tolerant transcri ptional program 
reflects absence of GVHD-associated determinants  vs. induction of a spec ific tolerance-inducing 
program. Shared and unique genes among these tw o gene lists will be determined, mapped to 
biologic pathways, and compared to prior data . (2) GVHD predictive biomarkers published to 
date have not been studied in this clinical context (HLA-dispa rate haploidentical transplants

Data Safety and Collection Monitoring 
a. Data collection  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_43235] (clinical research coordinator, 
research data specialist) will be responsible for maintaining all study related documents. The 
Moffitt electronic medical record (PowerChart) will serve as source document. Data collected 
will be stored in Moffitt Cancer Center’s database system, ONCORE. Identifying patient 
information will be kept confidential. Representa tives of the USF IRB will have access to patient 
information as it pertains to the study. Privacy and confidentiality of the information will be 
protected to the extent provided by [CONTACT_2371].  
 
b. Safety monitoring  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_43236] y responsibility for data safety and monitoring. 
Input will be sought from sub- investigators and other members of the BMT Program concerning 
data and safety issues. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_43237] a nd IRB. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_43238], that all data required for overs ight of monitoring are acc urately reported to a 
DSMB and/or to the PMC and IRB as required, th at adverse events are reported according to 
protocol guidelines, and that any adverse actio ns reflecting patient safety concerns are 
appropriately reported.  The investigators and members of the BMT Res earch Staff will meet regularly. The following 
data will be reviewed:  • Rate of accrual  
• Adverse events  
• Protocol deviations and/or violations.  
MCC Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] 
IRB # Pro00018316 
Version 6.0 
Version Date:  07/13/2018    31 • If necessary, corrective action and/or educat ional programs will occur to ensure subject 
safety and data integrity. Reports to the SRC,  PMC, and IRB will be submitted as required.  
c. Anticipated toxicity following allogeneic transplantation:  
There are numerous anticipated adverse consequences of transplantation, which include, but are 
not limited to conditioning regimen related toxicity such as severe mucositis, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive dis ease and death, early and late infectious 
complications, potentially severe or fatal acute or chronic graft vs. host disease, and relapse of 
primary disease and its complications. Thus, expected complications of transplantation will not be collected as adverse events on this trial.  
d. Informed consent  
The investigator must explain to each subject (or legally authorized representative) the nature of 
the study, its purpose, the proced ures involved, the expected du ration, the potential risks and 
benefits involved and any discomfort it may entail. Each subject must be informed that 
participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time 
and that withdrawal of consen t will not affect his/her subs equent medical treatment or 
relationship with the treating physician.  
 e. Adverse event collection and reporting  
Adverse Event 
An adverse event is any unexpected medical occu rrence associated with the use of a drug or 
therapy in humans, whether or not considered drug related. It  can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the use of a drug. Infection, acute and chronic GVHD will not be considered 
adverse events.

AE severity is graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to NCI CTCAE v4.03 or current version. 
Adverse events not included in the NCI CTCAE s hould be recorded and gr aded according to the 
General Grade Definition provided below: 
 
ADVERSE EVENT GENERAL GRADE DEFINITIONS 
Grade 1 Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; inte rvention not indicated

Suspected Adverse events – a subset of Adve rse Events based on causality        
 A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there is a reas onable possibility that 
the drug caused the event. Reas onable possibility means there is  evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the event.  
Unexpected  
An adverse event is considered unexpected if it is  not listed in the invest igator brochure, occurs 
in severity greater than previously  described, or - for the purpose of this protocol - if it is not in 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_43241]-transplantation toxicity.  
Serious 
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in th e view of either the inve stigator or the sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes: 1. Death 
2. A life-threatening adverse ev ent (places the subject at an  immediate risk of death) 
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43242] 
4. A persistent or significant disability or incapacitation 
5. A congenital anomaly or birth defect 
Additionally, events that jeopardize the subject a nd may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes above may also  be considered serious based on appropriate 
medical judgment.

Adverse event recording: 
Non-serious AE:  Only unexpected, grade 3-5 AE will be recorded. 
Serious AE:  All SAE will be recorded.  
Adverse event reporting:  
Non-serious AE: Unexpected, grade 3-5 AE will be  reported to the IRB in summary form on an 
annual basis. 
SAE: The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_43243], regardless attribution, 
within 24 hours of learning of the occurrence. In the event that the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_43244] (e.g.,  participant sought treatment 
elsewhere), the principal investig ator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_45459] 
include event term(s), serious criteria, and the investigator’s determination of both the intensity 
of the event(s) and the relationship of th e event(s) to study drug administration.

Management of Cytokine Release Syndrome ( CRS) after Haploidentical transplantation 
CRS is a non-antigen specific toxicity that occurs  as a result of a high level immune activation. 
This immune activation is asso ciated with modern cellular i mmunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_43245] a mediator for clinical benefit.  
It manifests when large numbers of lymphocytes  and/or myeloid cells become activated and 
release inflammatory cytokines. It has been classically associated with the infusion of 
monoclonal antibodies like anti-CD3 (OKT3), an ti-CD52 (alemtuzumab), anti-CD20 (rituximab) 
among others. It has also been re ported with the infusion of bi -specific antibodies for leukemia 
(blinatumomab), haploidentical  cells to patients with re fractory leukemia,  adoptive 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_43246] T-cells engineered to 
express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR T- cells) to treat leukemia or lymphoma.  
Symptoms usually begin shortly after cell infusion  (within 1 to a few hour s) and coincide with 
peak of cytokine release. Multiple cytokines are elevated, initially TNF α, and then IFNγ , IL-1β, 
IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10. Commonly, in seve re CRS, patients will develop progressive organ 
dysfunction and will require aggressive support in  intensive care unit. Emerging evidence has 
implicated IL-6 as a central mediator of toxicity  in CRS as the initiator of the pro-inflammatory 
cascade.  C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant produced in the liver largely in 
response to IL-6, and CRP level serve as a re liable surrogate of IL-6 activity. During CRS, it 
increases by [CONTACT_43263]. Rapid increase of CRP has been seen in patients at risk for severe 
CRS.

Version Date:  07/13/[ADDRESS_45460] allo reactive T-cells are 
activated and enter a rapid prolif eration phase. This phase is hera lded by [CONTACT_43264] +1 to +3 after graft infu sion. Fever rapi[INVESTIGATOR_43247] +4, +5.  
The bulk of the published data us ing marrow grafts suggests that this febrile period is rarely 
associated with organ dysfunction. In this protoc ol, we will use peripheral blood stem cell grafts, 
which in average, have 1 more log of T-cells co mpared to marrow. It is likely that this large 
increase in T-cells may generate a stronger T-cell activation/expansion and proportionally stronger cytokine release with a pot ential major clinical impact. Very little data is available in the 
literature on how to address this concern. As a safety measure we will incorporate an algorithm for the management of CRS that follows  the guidelines published by [CONTACT_43265].,
29 and has been 
used successfully in other settings, particularly after infusion of CAR-T cells. Table 1 
summarizes the clinical manifestations of CRS and table 2 has the algorithm for management.

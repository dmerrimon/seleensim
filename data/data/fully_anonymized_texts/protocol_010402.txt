STUDY TITLE:  Interstitial Cystitis – Examination of the Central Autonomic Network  (ICECAN)  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  A. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
To determine  whether  abnormal  Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity  in 
subjects with Interstitial Cystitis / Bladder Pain Syndrome ( IC/BPS) cause s or 
results from their  Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) state, and to elucidate underlying 
brain mechanisms . 
 B. HYPOTHESIS / SPECIFIC AIMS  
Our previous grant cycle (ICEPAC ) found that high frequency heart rate 
variability (hfHRV), a measure of parasympathetic function, and baroreflex 
sensitivity (BRS), a marker of ANS flexibility, were decreas ed in subject s with 
IC/BPS in comparison to healthy control subjects, and most significantly, in 
comparison to subjects with another type of CPP called myofascial pelvic pain 
(MPP). These findings underscore d the importance of carefully phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_544766].  We therefore believe ANS activity 
may control endogenous pain modulation and modulate the IC/BPS disease state.  
The proposed longitudinal set of studies is designed to  address this question, 
deepen our pathophysiologic understanding of CPP in general, and lead to new 
treatment insights tailored to this population.  
The findings from the last cycle, coupled with literature referenced in the 
background below, particularly related to periaqueductal gray (PAG) – prefrontal 
cortex (PFC) connections in irritable bowel sy ndrome (IBS) compared to 
ulcerative colitis (UC), and in subjects with CPP due to endometriosis, led us to hypothesize that the ventromedial (vm) PFC normally biases the ventrolateral PAG  to inhibit ascending no ciceptive pathways and urgency 
information fr om the bladder .  We believe loss of this vmPFC bias is both 
necessary and sufficient to incite an IC flare in a subject  with IC/BPS  and 
that abnormal ANS activity reflects this reset switch in the vlPAG . 
Specific Aim 1 – Do changes in HRV precede or follow  changes in IC/BPS disease activity? In a cohort of 
CPP subject s, determine if hfHRV and BRS (1a) change before or after changes in CPP disease activity 
monitored weekly; (1b) at baseline predict clinical status   at 4, 12, 16 and 24 weeks after enrollment, 
irrespective of treatment; Hypothesis and Data Interpretation : If HRV abnormalities set the stage for IC/BPS, 
HRV index changes will precede changes in the clinical and  state in IC/BPS more so than in MPP. In contrast, 
improvement in HRV/BRS following sy mptom change will suggest the opposite, and no change in HRV/BRS 
associated with clinical change or will imply an unrelated “by[CONTACT_112815]” effect.  
Specific Aim 2 – Does modulating HRV influence CPP disease activity? Determine the effect of directly modulating hfHRV using beta-blocker or placebo, in a 24-week crossover design study. Hypothesis and Data Interpretation : If improving hfHRV truly engenders a positive outcome and is not just a consequence of better 
health, increased HRV will decrease disease activit y and improve pain modulatory state in IC/BPS more so 
than in MPP. No effect will suggest that HRV changes result from, rather than produce clinical benefit.  
Specific Aim 3 – What fundamental reprogramming unde rlies changes in HRV and in clinical state?  
Mechanis tic: Determine if HRV changes parallel improved connectivity between the vmPFC and the PAG or Abbreviations

 increased PAG size with connectivity and morphometry data. Independent variables of increased PAG 
size and vmPFC -PAG connectivity will be regressed agains t HRV change, clinical improvement, and pain 
modulatory state.   
Hypothesis and Data Interpretation : If higher HRV derives from improved PFC -PAG connections, hfHRV 
rise should parallel tightened PFC- PAG connectivity and hypertrophy of the PAG. The absence of a 
relationship will suggest that improved clinical status will be the sole determinant of these brain changes.  
 C. BACKGROUND, SIGNIFICANCE, AND RATIONALE  
The European Association of Urology defines chronic pelvic pain (CPP) as pain unrelated to a str uctural 
process, perceived in structures related to the pelvis recurrent for at least 6 months and often associated with negative cognitive, behavioral, sexual, and emotional consequences [ 1].  A 1996 study [ 2] estimated that 9 
million women in the US between ages 18 and 50, some 15% of the female population at the time, suffered from CPP.  A [ADDRESS_712504] costs of CPP at nearly $1.4 billion in 2013 dollars, with 15% of women rep orting lost work revenue and 45% decreased work productivity [ 3]. 
Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) afflicts 3 to 8 million women in the US [ 4]. Symptoms 
of IC/BPS reduce quality of life, suppressing both social well-being and physical function[ 5].  The chronic pain, 
voiding dysfunction, sleep deprivation and associated co-morbid conditions interfere with relationships and employment [ 6, 7] with significant direct (doctor visits, medication, surgery) an d indirect (loss of productivity) 
economic im pact, currently exceeding $100 million per y ear [8]. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] [ADDRESS_712505] 
emerged,  and the pathophysiology remains obscure. Recent studies emphasize a key role for central processing 
networks
 [9]. In our first cycle of funding, we moved from the more common focus on central pain processing 
to study autonomic outflow.  We hypothesized that IC/BPS would feature abnormalities in autonomic function not seen in other CPP disorders such as MPP (myofascial pelvic pain) so that these changes could not simply be construed as due to CPP, since they occur in IC/BPS but not  in other types of CPP.  This hypothesis found 
support in the results of the prior cycle (see Section C, progress report).  These findings under score the critical 
importance of a careful ph enotype in CPP subject s, because the comparison of CPP subtypes would clearly 
have been impossible without it.  Since such phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_544768], 
we emphasize its significance as a novel part of our approach to CPP, and as a major theme in the current 
proposal. 
Significantly, our ICEPAC studies showed decreased ANS responsiveness (ANS- R) in subject s with 
IC/BPS; both in vagal tone, measured by [CONTACT_5019]-frequency heart rate variability (hfHRV), and in sympathetic reactivity, measured by [CONTACT_544807] (BRS), both at rest and during orthostatic challenge. While 
decreased vagal tone occurs in other chronic pain disorders like fibromyalgia [ 10, 11], chronic neck and 
shoulder pain [ 12], chronic back pain [ 13] and irritable bowel syndrome [ 14
], what is noteworthy is that two 
CPP disorders, IC/BPS and MPP differed in their overall ANS-R. Until now, low vagal tone was viewed as a 
general “marker” of chronic pain. Our findings suggest a new, disease- specific interp retation, perhaps 
reflecting ANS -R as a marker of specific cortical -brainstem networks that influence central modulation of pain 
experiences.  
This proposal aims to move the science of CPP from simple association s towards an investigation of cause 
and effect relationships.   We will determine whether the striking changes in ANS -R contribute meaningfully to 
the pathogenesis of IC/BPS through 3 aims: 
 1) Careful longitudinal repeated measures in individual subjects to determine if ANS- R changes precede  
            clinical changes;  
2) Assessing the impact of an intervention designed to change ANS-R on the clinical course of IC/BPS;  3) Evaluating changes in brain connectivity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the periaqueductal gray  
          (PAG) asso ciated with changes in ANS -R and improved disease status. 
 
In the first aim, we will also study ANS -R to a noxious stimulus, reported as deficient in subjects with 
IC/BPS [ 15]. In that report, the authors did not phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_544769]/BPS from MPP by [CONTACT_544808]; therefore some of these subjects may have also had MPP [ 15]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_419120], their 
3 
 findings support the hypothesis of an association between IC/BPS and central autonomic and perhaps pain 
dysregulation. In aim 1, we expect that changes in ANS- R will predict and precede clinical change in IC/BPS, 
and less so in MPP.   
Aim [ADDRESS_712506] therapy.  Beta-blocker treatment improves ANS- R measures. For example 
atenolol increased lfHRV by 45%, hfHRV by 84% and total power (TP) by 68% in health y adults [16], 
decreasing lf/hf power by 36%. In a large epi[INVESTIGATOR_119262] [ 17], subjects on beta- blockers increased TP by 
13%, hfHRV by 22%, and very low frequency (vlfHRV) by 25%, but with a 12% decrease in lf/hf power. In decompensated heart failure, which comes with high sympathetic stress, beta- blocker treatment resulted in 41 % 
higher hfHRV [ 18]. After acute MI, beta- blockers increase hfHRV and reduce lfHRV [ 19], and improve 
parasympathetic tone recovery, which correlates with improved outcome, and decrease morning sympathetic predominance [ 20]. Subject s randomized to propranolol had a greater increase in hfHRV power at 6- weeks and 
after [ADDRESS_712507] s [21], hfHRV power increased by 64% after 
atenolol and by 62% after metoprolol for [ADDRESS_712508] treat ment in s ubjects  with IC/BPS compared to MPP. 
 
Central sensitization, as seen in decreased pain tolerance, increased bladder sensitivity and hypervigilance, 
occurs in subject s with IC/BPS [ 22, 23 ]. These observations have not been studied by [CONTACT_544809]. The PFC –
PAG pathway is key to  pain -inhibiting circuitry [ 24], and vm PFC connects tightly to PAG [ 25], and facilitates 
disease relevant pain only, implying that cortical settings can allow or disallow ascending signals leading to  a 
pain experience [ 26].  In IBS, reduced lateral PFC influence on PAG appears to permit ascending nociceptive 
signals access to higher centers [ 27]. Consistent with this role, stimulating the lPFC -PAG pathway by 
[CONTACT_196959] [ 28] inhibits pain and the lPFC atrophies in the setting of chronic pain [ 29
]. Of 
critical interest to this application, the vmPFC is not only anatomically linked to the PAG [ 25], and critical to 
pain regulation, it is also the cortical structure that is most closely linked to the brainstem autonomic networks 
that are reflected by [CONTACT_544810] -R. 
 
Indeed, our studi es [30] suggest that higher ANS- R indicates a greater capacity for context and goals to 
modulate emotion, closely linked to the output of vmPFC. Roy et al. [ 31] conceptualize the vmPFC as a 
“system of systems” linking conceptuali zation, context, emotion and response.  Thus, its connection to the PAG 
may bias more caudal brainstem networks to specific modes that reflect particular behavior patterns and their autonomic accompaniments.  ANS-R may be the “poor man’s” marker of vmPFC outflow to the PAG.   Relevant to this proposal, vl PAG has just the right connections and functions to modulate flares and remissions 
in IC/BPS.  It (a) receives input from the PFC, (b) modulates ascending C-fiber visceral nociceptive input [ 32], 
(c) integrates autonomic and nociceptive responses [ 33], (d) increases hfHRV, an indicator of parasympathetic 
activity, in proportion to chronic pain relief produced by [CONTACT_329394] [ 34], (e) is activated during 
voiding and micturition and triggers micturition [ 35-38] and (f) takes part  in REM/non-REM switching during 
sleep, an ar ea of significant dysfunction in most of our subject s with CPP .  
 D. DESIGN AND METHODS  
This multi- site trial will recruit 3 groups of female subjects ages 18-80 years : 1) IC/BPS (n=60); 2) MPP with or 
without IC/BPS n=60); 3) 60 HCs [ only for fMRI ] (18  per group  for MRI). Recruitment will occur from the 
prior ICEPAC cohort from [CONTACT_544831]’s K award cohort at Northshore, and from specialty clinics associated with MCW and NorthShore University HealthSystem  (Chicago).  We expect to enroll 50 participants from each 
group at MCW /FMLH .
 We expect a 15% dropout over the [ADDRESS_712509] of study activities and responsibilities for each study site.

Protocol and Procedures  
All IC/BPS and MPP subjects will participate in both Aim [ADDRESS_712516] (Valsalva maneuver is only conducted at 
MCW).  See the Data Collection Schedule in Appendix 3.  
 
Aim 1  and Aim 2  – Experimental Group  
Baseline Visit : Week [ADDRESS_712517] . Tu’s K award cohort at Northshore, and from 
specialty clinics associated with MCW  and NorthShore University Medical Group (Chicago).  Up to 120 
IC/BPS and MPP subject s (60 per each group) will be recruited  study wide. We expect to enroll up to 100 
IC/BPS and MPP subjects (50 per group) from Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (FMLH) . FMLH subjects 
will be recru ited from the OB/GYN and Neurology Clinics.  A member of the research team at FMLH 
introduces subjects  to this study .  Consent is obtained by a member of the research team. Once the subject has 
had adequate time to consider participation, understands all of the risks and benefits and would like to participate,  the subject will sign informed consent and HIPAA documents.   
 Subjects will be pre-screened in person or on the phone. An in-person pre- screen takes place in the MCW 
Neurology Research Rooms at FMLH . If the subject is able to participate, subject will sign the informed 
consent form before completing a baseline evaluation. The baseline evaluation occurs either following consent or at another date convenient for them . Subjects must complete all baseline  activities within 2 weeks, or before 
their Week 4/Visit 2.  The baseline evaluation  is comprised of a general examination [39], a set of questionnaires 
(Appendix 3), background history documenting date of diagnosis, medications tried, duration of each treatment and dosing, surgeries and therapeutic and exploratory procedures performed (Appendix 3).  A pelvic examination will be performed with Chronic Pelvic Pain subjects only.  HRV/BPS (See Active Change in Posture – ACP below)  tests is  administered to the subject  (see procedures for details) . Subjects  will complete 
the uroflow measurement and Valsalva maneuver in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms with a member of the research team present.    Weekly Home Checks  will occur for 24 weeks following consent.  On ce a week,  subjects will complete a 24-
hour HR recording , voiding diary and the ACP recording using the eMotion Faros 360° portable EKG device.   
A member of the research team will contact [CONTACT_544812], text, email or skype each week to remind 
them to  complete the nighttime ACP, followed by [CONTACT_941] 24-hour HRV recording, voiding diary and the weekly 
questionnaires via the EMA App and link to RedCap (or via paper) .  This will ensure compliancy and will give 
the subject  the opportunity to ask any questions.  The researcher will contact [CONTACT_544813] ’s bedtime for the 
first few recordings until the subject is comfortable completing the recording by [CONTACT_329906] . The HR recording will 
be uploaded to MCW’s secure server  at the subject ’s next hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21186]. Throughout the study, subjects flare 
activity will be monitored via phone calls, texts or emails  and recording flares in the EMA application 
(Appendix 2) on the smartphone. This will be a Daily Flare Question in the EMA which is a set alarmed time to sound as a reminder for the duration of the subject’s participation.    The following weeks a fter each site visit and the [ADDRESS_712518] HRV analysis for steady state 
(supi[INVESTIGATOR_544772]) and time- varying HRV analysis will be performed, as descri bed above, 
extending over the 24-hr period, as we have shown [ 40]. Deidentified 24-hour HRV and ACP recordings will be 
sent to [CONTACT_544832] ’s research group  at University of [LOCATION_004]  Irvine for analysis.  
 Follow- up Visits : Weeks  4, 12, 16, 24, Visits 2-5 
Subjects  will arrive to MCW  Neurology Research Rooms to repeat the following: review of comorbidities, 
tender points exam, questionnaires, and HRV/BPS (ACP ) tests. Subjects  will complete the Valsalva maneuver 
in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms with a member of the research team present.  Chronic Pelvic Pain subjects will complete a repeat pelvic examination at Weeks 12 and 24.   
 MPP and IC/BPS subjects will be randomized to receive 8 weeks of either placebo (a pi[INVESTIGATOR_544773]), 
or metoprolol (a pi[INVESTIGATOR_544774]’s “fight or flight” circuits)  using Pi[INVESTIGATOR_37341]’s 
Randomization software [ 41
], overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_544775].  Metoprolol is in the class of 
“beta-blockers” commonly used for mild blood pressure control, and also commonly used for migraine.  Subjects  will be administered 8 weeks of metoprolol or placebo starting at their Week 4 Visit. Subjects  will 
complete a 4 -week washout period (Week 12 -16) and will be administered 8 w eeks of crossover (W eeks 16-
24).    
If for some reason it is not possible for the patient to collect the study product while on- site during a study visit, 
the study drug may be mailed to the patient if the site pharmacy agrees to ship the study medication to their study participant. This will ensure the study team is able to provide the study product to subjects if the manufacturer is unable to refill the prescription prior to the site's supply running out. The research pharmacy in Froedtert has agreed to ship the study medication to the subject(s) via FedEx. The study team will provide the research pharmacy with the FedEx Airbill and will record the tracking number on the airbill to track the date and time of the delivery to the participant(s). Participants  will then return the study medication at the next study 
visit. If for some reason the study participant(s) are unable to return the study medication to the site, they will be sent a FedEx airbill and supplies to use to return the study medication to the s ite. The study team will then 
record the tracking number of the package to track its return. The study team will also inform the participants to place the medication in the FedEx packaging, place the airbill on the packaging and drop it off at any FedEx location.  
 Optional : Blood will be drawn (~ 50 mL, a little more than 3 tablespoons) at each in-person visit at weeks 0, 4, 
12, 16, and 24 for chronic pelvic pain subjects (healthy control only at Baseline and Final visits; 2 draws total). 
We will determine (1) if immune or inflammatory factors play a role in pain cycles and (2) if energy production in cells might be impaired in chronic pelvic pain.  A portion of the blood plasma/serum will be sent to [CONTACT_544833]’s laboratory at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_544776]. The sample will be labeled by 
a number and will not contain any information that can be used to directly identify subject.  This portion of the study is critical to gather new information about pelvic pain, which is very poorly understood. We highly encourage subjects to participate in this portion of the study.  However, given how difficult it can be to obtain blood from some people with IC/BPS, we do allow subjects to opt out of the blood draw portion of this study and still participate in the other parts.   
 Urine will also be collected (~ 50ml) at each in person visit at weeks 0, 4, 12, 16 and 24 for chronic pelvic pain subjects (healthy control only at Baseline and Final visits). Samples will be sent to [CONTACT_544833]  for related 
analysis.  
 If for some unforeseen reason the physician assessment (MEDYSA) is unable to be completed during any of the study visits, the study investigator may complete this with the study participant over the phone.  
[ADDRESS_712519] long  visit they will complete  a general exam and physician evaluatio n, HRV/ BRS  (ACP) , 
Valsalva maneuver  (MCW only), and questionnaires (Appendix 3)).   
 Subjects  will complete a 24 -hour HRV/BRS recording from home once a week for [ADDRESS_712520] ’s bedtime  for the first few 
recordings until they are comfortable completing this on their own.   Subjects  will return to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 3 weeks later to complete the second long site visit procedures including a 
physician evaluation, HRV/BRS (ACP), Valsalva maneuver, and questionnaires (Appendix 3).   When subjects return to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544777] 3, at either week [ADDRESS_712521] long site visit pr ocedures including a physician evaluation, HRV/VRS (ACP), Valsalva maneuver, and questionnaires 
(Appendix 3).   Subjects will complete a 24 -hour HRV/BRS (ACP) recording from home once per week for the following [ADDRESS_712522] s will then return to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544778]/Visit [ADDRESS_712523] study  procedures including a physician evaluation, HRV/BPS (ACP), Valsalva maneuver, and 
questionnaires (Appendix 3).  
 Every subject will receive a general wellbeing follow -up phone call or email 4 weeks after their study 
completion.  
Aim 1  Observation al Al ternative Study : 
 Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will be eligible to  participate in the O bservational Alternative 
Study. Recruitment will occur from the prior ICEPAC cohort from [CONTACT_544831]’s K award cohort at Northshore, and from specialty clinics associated with MCW  and NorthShore University Medical Group (Chicago).  Up to 20 
IC/BPS and MPP subjects from Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (FMLH) will be recruited to this study from the OB/GYN and Neurology Clinics.  A member of the research team at FMLH will introduce subjects to this study.  Consent is obtained by a member of the research team. Once the subject has had adequate time to consider participation, understands all of the risks and benefits and would like to participate, she  will sign 
informed consent and HIPAA documents.    If the subject  is interested in this research study, she will first complete a pre -screen in person or on the phone to 
see if she is  able to participate. An in -person pre- screen takes place in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms at 
Froedtert H ospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (FH) , Neurology  or OBGYN clinics at Moorland Reserve Health Center  or Froedtert Main 
Campus, or at Westbrook Clinic or St. Joseph’s Health Center.

screening information shows that she  cannot be in the research, the research doctor will discuss other options 
with her  and/or refer her  back to her  regular doctor.  
 
If the subject is  able to participate, she  will complete [ADDRESS_712525] 
long-visit (baseline evaluation) may occur either t he same day s he provided consent or at another date 
convenient for her . The baseline evaluation comprises a general and pelvic examination (no speculum), 
psych ological questionnaires , detailed medical interview  and a background history questionnaire. This exam 
may take up to [ADDRESS_712526]  will complete a physician exam, a set of questionnaires, provide a 24 -hour 
voiding diary and the fol lowing tests: breathing test, heart rate test and a “uroflow measurement ,” A “uroflow 
measurement” measures the volume of urine, how long it takes to be released from the body and the speed. The subject  will also complete a repeat pelvic examination at Week 12.  
 The subject  will be asked to complete questionnaires at each long- visit including: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58900] (HADS), State- Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Thoughts About Symptoms (CSQ), 
Pennebaker Inventory of Limbic Languidness (PI[INVESTIGATOR_93601]), Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI), Female Genitourinary Pain Index (FGUPI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), PROMIS Social Roles and Activities, PROMIS Physical Function, PROMIS Fatigue, PROMISE Sleep Disturbance, the Holmes -Rahe Life Stress 
Inventory , the MAPP II Interactive Brief Pain Inventory , and the Covid- 19 Questionnaire . They  will complete 
the Childhood and Recent Trauma Events Scale (RTES) during their  first long -visit only.  
 The subject  can skip any question that they  do not feel comfortable ans wering on any of the forms. Although 
the first questionnaires will be completed in the clinic to keep their  answers private, the next will be completed 
while they  are at home. We cannot guarantee that those responses will be kept private and there is a chance that 
answers may be seen by [CONTACT_544814]. If their score is suggestive of emotional problems, 
study director   or a study Co -Investigator and/or  Psychologist will provide them  with places to help get 
treatment for these issues w ithin [ADDRESS_712527] (or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_167823]) if the subject  mention s it to the researchers or if it is 
suspected.  
 
The 24- hour voiding diary consists of tracking  how much liquid comes in and out of the subject’s  body in a [ADDRESS_712528] the time and amount of each void for the 24- hour period. A special 
measuring “hat” that fits over the toilet seat will help the subject  measure each void. The uroflow measurement 
requires the subject  to urinate on a special toilet in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms at FH. The toilet 
contains sensors that measure the speed of the urine flow and amount of urine. About one hour prior to this test the subject  will be asked to drink a quart of fluid.  
 The subject  will complete a “breathing test” (Valsalva Maneuver) in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms at 
FH. To complete this test the subject will have wrist straps secured to a table and asked to breathe in deeply and out forcefully through a tube. The subject will have a small band on their  arm to measure their  heart rate and 
blood pressure. The subject  will c omplete 4 cycles of breathing: two cycles while lying down flat and two 
cycles while leaning slightly forward.  
 The active posture change (ACP) heart rate recording (HRV) will take about [ADDRESS_712529] ed with an eMotion Faros 360° portable ECG device. It is small and lightweight, with 3- [ADDRESS_712530]’s  chest and tors o. The subject  will lie down flat on a 
bed and rest for [ADDRESS_712531]. Julian Thayer ’s research group  at 
University  of [LOCATION_004]  Irvine for analysis. The subject’s  sample will be labeled by a number and will not 
contain any information that can be used to directly identify them . 
 
Blood (optional) will be drawn and u rine will be collected (~ 50 mL, a little more than 3 tablespoons) at each 
in-person visit at weeks 0, 4, and 12. We will determine (1) if immune or inflammatory factors play a role in the 
subject’s  pain cycles and (2) if energy production in the subject’s  cells might be impaired. A portion of the 
subject’s  blood plasma/serum and uri ne will be sent to [CONTACT_544833]’s laboratory at the University of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_544779]. Both of the subject’s  samples will be labeled by a number and will not 
contain any information that can be used to directly identify them . This  portion of the study is critical for us to 
gather new information about pelvic pain, which is very poorly understood. We highly encourage the subject  to 
participate in this portion of the study. However, given how difficult it can be to obtain blood from some people 
with IC/BPS, we do allow the subject  to opt out of the blood draw portion of this study and still participate in 
the other parts.  
 
Weekly Home Checks  will occur once a week for [ADDRESS_712532]  will 
complete a 24- hour heart rate (HR) recording using the eMotion Faros 360° ECG device, the 24- hr voiding 
diary, answer a set of questions using the ICECAN mobile App installed on a preloaded smartphone, and complete questionnaires (those mentioned previously) that are  sent to the subject’s  personal e- mail account via 
a secure Internet connection. The questionnaires will be completed either electronically via REDCap or via paper. The heart rate recording will help us to study how the subject’s  heart rate changes through out the day. 
The subject  will place the patches on their  chest and torso to match the image found on the instruction sheet 
provided to them  as soon as they  get up in the morning. For the first few recordings, a member of the research 
team will contact [CONTACT_2299], either via telephone , email, skype or text , later in the evening, before the 
subject  goes to bed, to complete an additional recording. The researcher will ask the subject  to lie down flat on 
their bed for [ADDRESS_712533]’s  heart rate recording will be uploaded to a secure server by a member o f the research team. The 
researcher will ask whether the subject  has had a chance to complete the questionnaires. If in any case the 
subject is  unable to complete the questionnaires online, they  will be asked to return paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_544780] -person follow -up visit.  
 
The subject  will also complete a Daily Flare Question which asks about flare activity, management and if the 
flares are affecting them . These Flare Questions will be monitored via phone calls and recording in the EM A 
application on the smartphone.  
 After each site visit and the [ADDRESS_712534]  will repeat the  ACP recording prior to bedtime 
and the  24-hr HR recording, as described above, to compare the HRV recording done at home to the one 
performed at the matching on -site visit.  
 If the participants end up not answering some of the EMA questions, we will be asking them the following:   At 
any time during the study, did your pain affect your ability to answer any of the EMA questions?   When you 
didn't answer the EMA questions, what percentage of time was it due to pain?   These questions will be asked at 
each in -clinic visit appointment.  
 If for some unforeseen reason the physician assessment (MEDYSA) is unable to be completed during any of the study visits, the study investigator may complete this with the study participant over the phone.  
 
[ADDRESS_712535] will receive a general wellbeing follow -up phone call or email 4 weeks after their study 
completion.

Positive answers 
are followed up by [CONTACT_099] -investigator to determine 
if the subject has the disorder (ranked as definite, probable, possible, absent). Severity is quantified on an 11-point disease activity numeric rating scale (NRS) for compariso n with CPP disease activity. The PROMIS 
Sleep Disturbance will help quantify sleep effectiveness.  Chronic pelvic pain subjects will also have a 
pelvic examination completed  at time of consent, week 12 and week 24. 
 
Questionnaires 
1. The Childhood and Rece nt Trauma Events Scale (R TES) includes 7 questions and will determine the 
independence of childhood trauma from adult trauma as a factor associated with IC/BPS.  Questionnaires may  be completed under the direct or indirect (via video link) supervision of a research 
coordinator to enhance adherence.   2. Depressive symptom atology will be assessed with the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] 
(HADS) . Adults rate each of the 14 items on a four-point Likert scale indicating how frequently they 
experience each symptom.  
 3. Symptoms of anxiety will be assessed with the State- Trait  Anxiety Inventory (STAI)[ 42]. The STAI 
is a self -report measure developed to help distinguish between a person’s state anxiety and their trait 
anxiety . Subjects complete 40 items on a four-point likert scale indicating how frequent ly they 
experience each symptom.  
 4. Cognitive patterns of thinking about pain will be measured with the Thoughts About Symptoms (CSQ).  The CSQ  is a self -report measure developed for adults with chronic pain conditions to assess 
their negative thinking patterns regarding pain.  Adults will complete  [ADDRESS_712547]    X  X X X X

 7. The Female Genitourinary Pain Index (FGUPI) is a valid and reliable condition -specific instrument 
that can be used to quantify symptoms in men and women with bladder/urologic pain. This questionnaire also discriminates between subjects with IC/BPS and other diagnoses. Clemens et al . 
demonstrated that the score in the GUPI [INVESTIGATOR_544784] I ndex correlated highly [ 45]. This questionnaire consists of 9 questions 
regarding location of pain, pain associated with certain activities frequency of urination, sensation of not emptying the bladder and how the symptoms affected daily activit y [46].  This questionnaire has been 
chosen since it is currently used by [CONTACT_18121] -MAPP  group and will allow for comparison of results. 
 8. The Perceived S tress S cale ( PSS) assesses an  individual’s perception of stress  over the past month 
[47]. The [ADDRESS_712550] month ( http://www.mindgarden.com/documents/PerceivedStre ssScale.pdf

sustained sense of exhaustion that likel y decreases one’s ability to execute daily activities and function 
normally in family or social roles.   12. The Holmes- Rahe Life Stress Inventory (HRLSI) is a self -report instrument composed of [ADDRESS_712552] experienced in the previous month 
or two months.   13. The M APP II Interactive Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) will be used to conduct brief pain inventory at 
each in -person visit for pain intensity experienced by [CONTACT_124527] 7 da ys before their visit.  
 14. If the participants end up not answering some of the EMA questions, we will be asking them the following:  At any time during the study, did your pain affect your ability to answer any of the EMA 
15 
 questions?  When you didn't answer the EMA questions, what percentage of time was it due to pain?  
These quest ions will be asked at each in- clinic visit appointment if some questions were previously 
missed . 
 15.  The Covid-19 questionnaire will be administered at each in-person visit and involves how Covid-19 has affected the participant emotionally.  
 
Physiologic Studies Methodology  
During the following battery of tests ( Active Change of Posture,  and Valsalva Maneuver ), a surface 
ECG monitor (eMotion Faros 360°, Mega Electronics Ltd, F inland) and a noninvasive continuous 
hemodynamic monitoring system using the plethysmographic pulse pressure waveform from a finger cuff (Nexfin, Edwards Lifesciences Corp, Irvine, CA) will be attached to the subject . The Nexfin will 
only be used at the MCW site due to availability of equipment and expertise in the field. These devices will continuously record ECG and blood pressure waveforms and derived RR- intervals (heart rate) and 
beat-to-beat systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure [ 48, 49] . BRS parameters will be 
computed later, using both the time-domain sequence technique and the frequency-domain coherence method [ 50-52] . The HRV time - and frequency- domain parameters for steady state data such as supi[INVESTIGATOR_544785] [ 53-55] . In addition, time -frequency 
analysis (change of spectral parameters over time) will be computed for the ACP  test [ 56]. A physician 
will review the ECG for any abnormal findings  and make appropriate clinical recommendations to the 
subject’s referring site physician by [CONTACT_544818] a subject  of 
one of the Principal Investigator s.  
 Active Change o f Posture (ACP):  Subjects will have a 3  to 5- lead Faros ECG monitor placed on them in 
a private room with white noise and dim lighting (matching lux and dB levels across sites) .  Subjects 
will rest supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] 10 minutes followed by [CONTACT_20904] 5 minutes of supi[INVESTIGATOR_544786]. Subjects will then stand close to their bed within 3 seconds (or as quickly as they can)  without reclining on any furniture 
and 5 more minutes will be recorded. The research coordinator’s presence in the room throughout the entire process wil l ensure compliance with the protocol and also document if the subject  reports any 
symptoms (visits 1 -5). We will use the supi[INVESTIGATOR_544787]. The 
ACP procedure results in venous pooling. Characteristic HR change dynamics after stand up can index cardiovagal function, e.g. (R- R interval at beat 30)/(R -R interval at beat 15) [ 57-59] . The immediate 
response is a sharp decrease in BP and total systemic resistance at 5 to 10 seconds, followed by a rapid rebound and overshoot. A corresponding HR increase follows in 3 to 5 seconds and then attenuates. After 30 seconds, the hemodynamic parameters become relatively stable [ 60]. HRV and BP variability 
provide deeper insight in the time course of the autonomic response to ACP. Total and lf power are raised after standing and hf fraction is reduced [ 61]. Although complex physiological adjustments occur, 
the test is easy to administer and repeat by [CONTACT_423] s at home (see below). Time- frequency spectral 
analysis of HRV and BP data will detect changes in sympathetic and vagal function and BRS.  Coded 24-
hour HRV and ACP recordings will be sent to [CONTACT_544832] ’s research group at University of 
[LOCATION_004] Irvine  for analysis.  
 Valsalva Maneuver:  Only subjects enrolled at MCW will qu antify the cardiovagal/adrenergic 
components of ascending and descending baroreflex functions. It provides a measure of BRS beyond the spontaneous BRS analysis from ACP [ 62]. After a [ADDRESS_712553] hold intrathoracic pressure of 40 mmHg for 15 seconds and then release. A series of 4 
16 
 reproducible maneuvers will be performed, 2 while lying flat and 2 while tilted at 30°. The maneuver is 
repeated 4 times  in total, not including practice runs . The Valsalva Ratio and beat -to-beat BP response 
are co mputed. Cardiac sympathetic function is inferred from the resulting increase in HR, while 
maintenance of mean pressure during the maneuver reflects vasomotor sympathetic function, with gender and age -based norms described for both. The bradycardia that occ urs during the release phase 
represents a second, confirmatory measure of cardiac parasympathetic function [ 58, 63, 64 ]. 
 Uroflow and 24h voiding diaries  will be performed at major visits (visits 1 -5) to  evaluate the impact of  
changes  in HRV on bladder physiology. Subjects  will be asked to urinate on a special toi let in the FH  
Neurology Research Rooms  during which the speed and pattern of their  urine stream will be determined.  
Subjects  will also be asked to monitor their drink intake and output for the same 24 hours they complete 
the 24-hour EMA .  They will measur e their own output using a hat provided to them by [CONTACT_17881].  
 
Home che cks (fig ure 1 small up -arrows) will occur once each week , even on- site visit weeks . 24-hour 
HR recording will use the Faros 360 (Mega Electronics Ltd, Finland) for RR- intervals & accelerometry 
during the following assigned activities and the surrounding 24-hour periods. On each night, subjects  
will go to a bedroom with minimal distractions (i.e. no TV or radio, only communication devices to communicate with research coordinator) and with dim lighting to rest supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] [ADDRESS_712554] is comfortable with this process . An 
accelerometer built into the eMotion HRV 3D device will document position changes. Subjects  will 
complete  a weekly Ecological Momentary Assessme nt (Appendix 2) during the day of monitoring to 
assess adherence to the at -home ACP tests as well as to record any shifts in mood/affect or subjective 
pain experience. The [ADDRESS_712555]’s completed  questionnaires and the HR recording will be upload ed to a 
secure MCW server.  
 After each site visi t and the 24 hours before v isit 5, subjects will complete the bedtime ACP recording 
followed by [CONTACT_941] 24- hr ANS -R screen, as described earlier, without any questionnaire (except diary as 
before) to ensure comparability of the HRV recording at home to the one performed at the matching on-site visit. The recorded HR data will be downloaded from the monitor and standard HRV analysis for steady state (supi[INVESTIGATOR_544772]) and time- varying HRV analysis will be performed, as 
described above, extending over the 24-hr period, as we have shown [ 40].  
 
Beta-Blocker vs Placebo  
All MPP and IC/BPS subjects in the Experimental Group will participate in this aim occurring simultaneously with aim 1  and employing a 4 -8-4-8 week crossover design. A baseline of 4 weekly 
repeated measures will precede 8 weeks of placebo or beta-blocker, 4 weeks of washout, and 8 additional weeks of crossover. Subjects will be adaptively randomized across all 3 sites in blocks of 4 to either beta -blocker or placebo for ANS- R modulation, stratified by [CONTACT_544819]/BPS, 
using Pi[INVESTIGATOR_37341]’s Randomization software [ 41], overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124] . Pi[INVESTIGATOR_249341]. We chose a β
1-
adrenoceptors  cardio -selective blocker because of its more restricted effects. Metoprolol is useful in the 
17 
 treatment of arrhythmias, hypertension, angina, acute myocardial infarction and the prevention of 
migraine headaches. Based on personal communication with cardiology and psychiatry (R Josephson 
10-15-2014 and J Thayer 9-11-14), [ADDRESS_712556], and 4 weeks for washout. Thi s intervention aims at  our prior cycle finding that subjects with IC/BPS have higher 
baseline HR compared to HCs. After 4 weeks baseline, subjects will receive a bottle with capsules containing 25 mg of metoprolol tartrate or placebo distributed in a double-blind manner by [CONTACT_25733]’s investigational pharmacy.  Subjects will start at 25 mg once daily a nd increase to the goal dose of 25 mg 
2/day after one week, if HR has not decreased below [ADDRESS_712557] week.  A member of the research team will train the participant how to count her pulse. 
Chen W et al. [ 65] reported increased hfHRV and decreased lfHRV in 60 sleep-deprived young adults 
with this dose, noting a reduction in premature atrial and ventricular complexes. The subjects will then washout for 4 weeks and enter crossover in similar manner (red and green bands in fig ure 1). 
 If for some reason it is not possible for the patient to collect the study product while on- site during a 
study visit, the study drug may be mailed to the patient.

noise is minimized, using a passive acoustic barrier material that reduces acoustic transmission by [CONTACT_5554] 6 dB for enhanced patient comfort without compromising imaging performance.  
 Higher -Order Shimming. The MR750 is equipped with five higher- order shim -resistive shim coils to 
minimize  patient -induced field perturbations. In addition to the linear terms (X, Y, Z), the shim set 
includes XY, XZ, YZ, Y2, X2-Y2 compensation coils. 
 RF Amplifier. To drive the MR [ADDRESS_712559] Computing Platform, Reconstruction Engine, and Software. Version 20.x based software. The MR750 utilizes 2.6 GHz processing technology with VRE2.0 recon architecture.

 Version -20.x- based software will include all commercially available pulse sequences, spectroscopy, and 
imaging options, nominally equivalent in form and function to the MR750 (3T) platform. Dual CPU host-computer includes Linux OS, dualcore.   Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging ( DKI) scans  use the SE -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_544789]- collinear 
gradient directions and at least two b values such as 1000 and 2000, 4 reference scans will also be 
acquired in the axial orientation, aligned with the high resolution T1 weighted scans (8 minutes). Motion 
and eddy current related distortions will be corrected with FSL software ( http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/
) 
[66, 67] . DKI data will be processed using software developed in -house that generates axial, radial and 
mean kurtosis maps (Kax, Krad and MK) in addition to conventional Fractional Anisotropy and Mean Diffusivity ( FA and MD) maps. DKI measures non -Gaussianity of the diffusion signals and it has been 
shown to be a more sensitive marker of subtle changes in brain white matter compared to conventional DTI [ 68].

G. RISKS AND THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH WILL BE TAKEN TO MINIMIZE RISK 
EXPOSURE  
Overall, potential risks associate d with participation in the proposed study are similar to those  
experienced by  [CONTACT_544820].  
 
Physical. Subjects participating in the phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_544792] (Aim 1) will be 
exposed to phys ical risks associated with the standard of care for chronic pelvic pain, including but not 
limite d to pelvic  examination. The course of treatment is left to the discretion of each subject’ s urologist, 
urogynocologist or  pelvic pain specialist. In addition to the standard of care, research subjects wi ll 
undergo non- invasive testing  such as tender point evaluation, baroreflex and HRV assessment as pa rt of 
study screening, baseline  metrics, and follow -up visits.  Tender point evaluation is considered stand ard 
of care for myofascial pain  disorders such as fibromyalgia and may lead to bruising and pain at the site 
of palpation.  Procedures  used to assess baroreflex sensitivity and HRV are considered the standard of 
care for ass essing autonomic nervous system  deficiencies with minimal associated physical risks . 
Subjects may feel anxious, dizzy, nauseated or get a headache from breathing in and out as instructed during the breathing test. (HR and blood pressure monitoring during structured breathing and change of posture). Use of beta- blockers (Aim II) such as m etoprolol can lead to diarrhea, stomach crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
nausea, vomiting, rashes, blurred vision, muscle crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], fatigue,  depression, heart failure or heart  
block in subject s with heart problems (although known he art issues are  an exclusion criteria), headaches,  
dizziness, nightmares, hallucinations, shortness of breath in asthmatics, sexual  dysfunction, and may 
cause low  or high blood glucose. Physical risks associated with fMRI (Aim III) are not f ully known but 
current evidence  indicates that there is minimal risk associated with the procedure. Because the MRI 
scanner produces a very  strong magnetic field, there is some risk involved in the form of the potenti al 
for metallic objects to move  through the room creati ng projectiles that could harm individuals and/or 
damag e the scanner. Healthy controls  will be screened for the absence of pelvic pain, and other 
pain/autonom ic disorders, baseline metrics,  psychological questionnaires will be determined,  and 
subjects may partake in the HRV , baroreflex, and  fMRI portions of the study. Potential physical risks 
will be discussed with all subjects and knowledge of these  risks will be made evident through the 
consent form.  
 
Psychological. Risks associated with the psychological  questionnaires are considered minimal.  Since 
self-disclosure of personal information may produce some transient emotional discomfort, the informed 
consent  process makes clear that subjects may decline to participate in any aspect of the project, 
including completing  questionnaires.  Although not a direct risk of the study, our instruments may 
expose levels of psychopathology  that require clinical attention. Measures will be scored within [ADDRESS_712562]

K. STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_544795] -R is accompanied by a change in the connectivity 
between PFC and PAG. We will use a linear model with connectivity at 24 weeks as outcome, 
connectivity at baseline as a covariate and change in ANS -R, demographics such as age and group and 
the interactions of group with other covariate.  
 The Secondary Endpoints  are to ascertain structural changes that correlate with larger AN S-R, 1) 
changes in fiber bundles connecting PFC and PAG using DTI/DKI, and 2) changes in the size of PAG using VBM analysis.  We expect to see changes in structure at [ADDRESS_712564]?  WHO ARE ITS  
MEMBERS?  HOW OFTEN DO THEY MEET?   
A DSMB of independent investigators will be established to advise the NIDDK and the study investigators. Their responsibilities include the annual review and evaluation of the accumulated study data for 
subject  safety, study conduct and progress, and, to make recommendations to NIDDK 
concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the trial. They will monitor adverse events, evaluate data quality, completeness and timeliness, examine performance of the individual sites, review adherence to the protocol and intervention fidelity across site, and oversee factors that might affect subject safety or data confidentiality.  We will recruit national experts in CPP or autonomic function to 
be on the IC ECAN advisory board and DSMB . All key investigators and the  DSMB  will meet once per 
year.  Any severe adverse events  (SAEs) encountered that the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_544796] a nd reported to the IRB at the time of 
the occurrence.  All other SAEs and adverse events  (AEs) will be recorded and submitted annually to the 
DSMB .

PROCEDURES TO BE EMPLOYED IN ANALYZING DATA AND THE ANTICIPATED SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED STUDY 
Power: There is little prior information on which to perform a formal power analysis, so conservative assumptions determine the difference in correlations that will be detectable with 80% power at the .017% level (to allow for 3 independent tests – and more dependent ones – at the 5% level).  We assume an analysis of 102 subjects allowing for 15% dropout in which partial correlations (partialing out IC/BPS versus MPP and other relevant covariates i.e., age and treatment are analyzed. First, we use conservative assumptions to determine the difference in correlations that w ill be detectable with 80% 
power at the .017% level (to allow for 3 independent tests at the 5% level). Assuming an effective sample size of 102-3 =[ADDRESS_712565] variance 1/96 (90) and the difference between two such correlations will be twice that, conservatively assuming zero correlation between the two correlations  It then follows that, for a two-sided test, a difference in correlation of ~0.[ADDRESS_712566] a strong positive correlation between the two correlations, a much smaller difference will be detectable.  
 Analysis : Standard mixed model regression analysis will 
determine how well baseline measures predict later measures.  Since all the measures will be continuous or quasi- continuous, 
all data will be transformed, as necessary, for residuals to be approximately normally distributed.  Although both predictors of interest and possible confounding covariates can be simultaneously included in the regression models, examining the outcome variables univariately or multivariately, to examine the order of time changes , we propose correlation of 
covariate -adjusted residuals using Fisher’s variance- stabilizing 
z-transformation, appropriately allowing for the correlation 
between correlatio ns [69]. First, we will take a weighted 
average of th e covariate-adjusted ANS-R variables to minimize the standard error of the weighted 
average (subject to the sum of the squared weights equaling 1), and similarly for the pain scores. With 5 major time points there are 4- time intervals. We define a change as the (signed) difference in value of a 
variable between two time points, so that for each variable we have 10 changes (4 of length 1, 3 of length 2, 2 of length 3, and 1 of length 4 intervals). We thus have a 10x10 matrix of correlations when we pair a change in the ANS -R variable with a change in the clinical score: 11 of these correlat ions 
correspond to changes in ANS-R preceding changes in pain, and 11 to changes in pain preceding ANS-R: the other 78 correlations are ambiguous regarding the order in whi ch the changes occur (Table 3). We 
will calculate these [ADDRESS_712567] the equality of the 11 
23 
 implying pain causes ANS -R to the 11 implying the converse, performing three two-sided tests: one on 
the average correlations where all intervals are of length 1; one on the average of those where the 
interval length is 1 for one variable and 2 for the other; and one for the correlations where the interval length is 2. If one of these is significant, similar detailed analyses with finer intervals will be warranted.  
 
The Primary Endpoint of aim 1 is the determination of time sequence between changes in ANS- R and 
changes in measures of daily pain and function (MPI, Promis 8a/8b, GUPI ).  Secondarily, we will also 
assess sequence relationships between changes in ANS -R and changes in bladder function by [CONTACT_544823].  We expect ANS -R, a putative measure of the operating mode of vmPFC, to increase (both 
in total power and in HF fraction) before clinical improvement in subjects who fulfill the IC/BPS 
phenotype . Pi[INVESTIGATOR_544798] : if we do not demonstrate this specific relationship: 1) a 
different relationship may emerge, and we will explore its implications; 2) the relationship may exist in certain su bgroups, for example predicted by [CONTACT_544824]- R, or 
psychological features; 3) the relationship may exist only for major changes in clinical status as may happen during “flares” or “remissions”; 4) specific aspects of AN S-R responsiveness (such as change 
with standing ) may correlate better with clinical change than ANS -R itself in a particular state.  
 Secondary Endpoint: 1) determination of whether ANS- R at baseline predicts clinical status (MPI, 
GUPI), bladder physiology, at 4, 12, 16 and 24 weeks.   Pi[INVESTIGATOR_544798] :  if this is 
not the case, we will examine other psychological measures for a similar predictive role, and ANS -R 
stimulus responsiveness rather than ANS- R itself.   
 Technical Considerations : though this portion is not invasive and virtually without associated risks for 
the subjects, we may still struggle with poor home screen compliance. If so, we have considered sending the research coordinators to the homes (if budget allows) or change from weekly visits to every other week.    Aim 3 Analysis, Endpoints, Expected Findings , Pi[INVESTIGATOR_544799] : VBM:  Voxel based lesion -symptom mappi[INVESTIGATOR_544800] a major role in organizing and 
planning goal -directed behavior for lPFC regions, while vmPFC provides insight and harmonizes 
behavior with emotional, social and cognitive forces (see for example [ 70]).  One might speculate that 
goal-directed behavior from lPFC regions must suppress ascending signals through PAG, while 
internally attentive behavior (through vmPFC) will want to enhance these signals to attend to them, potentially explaining the opposing forces these two areas exert over PAG. We will be examining these relation ships in great detail across our subjects.  VBM will be compared between HCs, IC/BPS  and MPP 
subject s, initially; paired sampling across time will be utilized to determine the change in PAG size 
across time; the magnitude of this change will be regressed a gainst quantitation of improvement using 
mixed models as described in aim 2.  DTI/DKI:  Kax, Krad, MK, FA and MD maps will be generated 
for statistical analysis, and changes in both associated with HRV index changes in tracts that connect the PFC to PAG and  raphe will be analyzed using Tract -Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), a non -parametric 
permutation test for analysis [ 71, 72]. Statistical tests will be thresholded at p<0.[ADDRESS_712568] the hypothesis that the connecting 
bundles enlarge in those subjects whose HRV increases across the 3 time points . Connectivity:  After 
standard image pre-processing using the AFNI software packa ge [73], cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_544801] [ 74], band- pass filtering, Voxelwise multiple linear regression analysis (AFNI's 
3dDeconvolve [ 75]), we will analyz e the correlation BOLD time -course coefficient maps for each 
[ADDRESS_712569] (ROI), and convert to Z-score maps. An automated affine transformation maps Z -score 
maps to stereotaxic atlas space, with standard smoothing and calcu lation of t- statistics for each ROI. 
Significance uses magnitude and extent (cluster size) criteria with permutation testing to select a whole -
brain corrected p < 0.[ADDRESS_712570] square to account for covariates. Changes in 
functional connectivity strength between PAG and PFC associated with HRV changes will be analyzed using resting state fcMRI results. Temporal data analysis will utilize 3dREMLfit (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dREMLfit.html
). CSF pulsation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_544802]- fMRI analysis. These are recorded with MRI compatible EKG system and a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_263143].  
 
Sample size justification: For a correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_712571] 95% confidence 
interval of (0.043, .784). W e will ex amine the change over time using a mixed effects model. We expect 
that brain maps of connectivity will show such a change, present when HRV has significantly increased, and more marked in IC/BPS than in MPP. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_544798] : connectivity changes 
may occur in other areas seeding from PAG.  We will use the information to g enerate hypotheses 
regarding the underlying neurophysiology of IC/BPS.  If the changes do not correlate with ANS- R 
change, we will re- explore the analysis using clinical improvement.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_544798] : should we not see changes in subjects with better ANS- R, we may 
consider extending the fMRI and DKI portion of the grant.    
Timeline ( Table 4) and Data 
Management.  The NIH -MAPP data 
core at U Penn will mana ge all 
subject data while the UCLA imaging core will manage imaging data.  We will use REDCap onsite (Research operates within the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 128 -bit encryption Electronic Data Capture) a secure, web -based application designed for 
research data capture. Clinical data entry will occur on site and MCW will be responsible for the physiologic data entry. Sites will only see data from their site and access privileges will reflect need for and is fully in compliance with: (a) Guidance for Industry 21 CRF Part 11; Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures; Scope and Application [FDA]; (b) 21 CRF Part 820 (QSR); (c) Guidance for Industry; E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance; (d) Guidance for Industry; Computerized Systems used in Clinical Investigatio ns; (e) General Principals of Software Validation; Final Guidance 
for Industry and FDA Staff; (f) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Missing Data. We will examine the pattern of missing data using logistic reg ression. Where it seems 
reasonable to assume the data are missing at random (MAR), we will use a mixed model approach or for any items missing such as demographics, we will use multiple imputation. We will conduct a sensitivity analysis to check other assu mptions, if i t appears data are not MAR.

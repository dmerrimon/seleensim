with cerebral palsy .  In addition, this study will contribute  much needed  data to the 
clinical tria ls community on the natural history of the motor function in CP over short -
term (less than 1 year) time periods relevant to the conduct of clinical trials  and assess 
the safety of AlloCB and hCT -MSC infusion in children with cerebral palsy . 
2.[ADDRESS_145992] common – and most costly – chronic motor disorder of childhood.  The 
cornerstone of cerebral palsy treatment relies on countless hours of physical and 
occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_129359].  There is no treatment available to 
repair the brain damage that caused the disabilities.  Thus, a novel therapy that could 
promote repair of damaged brain tissue has potential to reduce societal burden and to 
greatly improve survival, function, and q uality of life for patients with cerebral palsy.   
 
Umbilical cord blood (CB) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) lessen  the clinical 
and radiographic impact of hypoxic brain injury and stroke in animal models.  In patients 
with leukodystrophies undergoin g unrelated donor CB transplantation, donor cells have 
been observed engrafted in the brain post -transplant.  In addition, we have observed 
ongoing myelination in the brains of these patients after initial demyelination caused by 
[CONTACT_54648].   The central hypothesis of our work is that CB  cells or human 
cord tissue -derived MSCs (hCT -MSC) , acting  primarily  through paracri ne mechanisms, 
could serve as vehicle s for emerging cellular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_129360].  We 
conducted safety studies and recently completed phase II, randomized, double blind, 
placebo -controlled trial of autologous CB in children with cerebral palsy.  In that study, 
children who were infused with ≥2x107 cells/kg exhibited a greater degree of motor 
improvement tha n children who received lower doses or placebo.  That study was limited 
by [CONTACT_129395] a banked 
autologous cord blood unit and by [CONTACT_129396] 1 -2 years of age for whom 
analysis of the predicted motor change score was not possible.  We also conducted a 
phase I safety study of sibling CB infusion in 15 patients with cerebral palsy, indicating 
that allogeneic partially HLA -matched CB infusion is safe in this patient population.   
 
Therefore, this study is a phase I/II trial of higher doses of allogeneic  CB or hCT-MSC  
to confirm our previous findings and eliminate the restriction of having an autologous CB 
unit.  The hypothesis of this trial is that adequately dosed allogeneic CB cells and hCT -
MSC administered intravenously will, via cellular or trophic effects, induce repair of brain 
injury in children with cerebral palsy, thereby [CONTACT_129397].  In 
addition, data from the prior study indicates that brain connectivity as measured by [CONTACT_129398] (DTI) correlates with functional status and motor 
improvement in children with cerebral palsy, and therefore may be useful as  a biomarker 
and predictor of response.  This relationship will be further explored in this clinical trial.

April 1, [ADDRESS_145993] cere bral palsy (http://ucp.org/wp -content/uploads/2013/02/cp -fact-
sheet.pdf).  While some infants at risk can be identified at birth, many cases are silent in 
the newborn and only detected when the child exhibits paresis, spasticity and 
developmental delay in the first few years of life.  Affected children have varying degrees 
of functional impairments ranging from mild limitations in advanced gross motor skills to 
severely limited self -mobility despi[INVESTIGATOR_129361].  Though cerebral 
palsy is  a motor disorder, it can be associated with cognitive and sensory deficits and 
can have a detrimental impact on global childhood development by [CONTACT_129399], communicate, learn, and achieve independence.[ADDRESS_145994] of care of $8.2 billion for 
affected children in 2002.5  Unfortunately, no curative therapy exists.  Current treatment 
modalities focus on maximizing functional abilities and quality of life through several 
approaches.  T hese include non -pharmacologic measures such as physical, 
occupational and speech therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], orthotics, optimal nutrition, constraint therapy and 
use of adaptive devices; pharmacologic interventions such as oral pharmacological 
agents, botulinum toxin inje ctions, and oral or intrathecal baclofen; and surgical options 
including dorsal rhizotomy and various orthopedic procedures.  Most children with 
cerebral palsy require lifelong supportive care, adaptive therapy and equipment, and 
special education, utilizi ng greater shares of medical and societal resources as 
compared to typi[INVESTIGATOR_6249].  
Both full -term and premature infants can develop cerebral palsy as a result of brain 
injury sustained during the prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal periods.  Most affected full -
term infants have sustained a prenatal neurologic insult, such as an in-utero  stroke, or a 
hypoxic -ischemic injury at the time of delivery.  The incidence of cerebral palsy is much 
higher in premature babies, affecting more than ten perc ent of very low birth weight 
infants (<1500g).[ADDRESS_145995] cells via  trophic and/or paracrine effects.  While the exact mechanisms 
of neural sparing and/or recovery remain the subject of preclinical investigations, several

derived cells could also potentially act as a vehicle to deliver neuroprotective and 
restorative factors or signal endogenous cells to act in a targeted way toward damaged 
brain tissue.   
 
In children with cerebral palsy, reorganization of central motor pathways has been 
demonstrated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electromyography (EMG), 
and functional MRI (fMRI).  In patients with a unilateral lesion involving the motor tracks,  
motor control of the affected limbs is primarily provided by [CONTACT_129401][INVESTIGATOR_129362], healthy hemisphere,16-[ADDRESS_145998] Blood  (CB)  
Many children who might benefit from CB therapi[INVESTIGATOR_129363]. In order to extend these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_129364] s, use of an allogeneic product 
will be necessary. Allogeneic CB has been used extensively in the field of hematopoietic 
transplantation. More recently, based on substantial preclinical data, CB has been 
investigated as a potential therapy for patients wit h brain injuries and neurological  
conditions. As most children and adults do not have access to autologous CB, allogeneic 
cells are frequently utilized in clinical trials of cellular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_129365].  
 
Allogeneic human CB as a source of cells for hematopoietic reconstitution after 
myeloablative therapy  has a proven track record of over 30 years of use in the clinic, 
with over 35,000 transplants performed.21  Allogeneic CB transplantation has been 
shown to be  safe and has not been shown to cause tumors or cellular dysregulation.  
Compared to other cell sources, CB has the following advantages:  
1. CB is an abundantly available source of stem cells that can be harvested at no risk 
to the mother or infant.  It is routinely collected, cryopreserved, and banked.  
2. Public CB donors are screened for risks of transmitting infectious agents through 
blood per CFR1271, subpart C donor screening regulations.  Important infectious 
agents, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV), are much less common in the newborn 
than adults, and are less likely to contaminate CB units.  
3. CB units, cryopreserved and banked, are a vailable on demand, and can be easily 
shipped and thawed for use when needed, eliminating delays and uncertainties that 
complicate bone marrow collection from unrelated donors.

hematopoietic stem cell sources.  
5. CB contains pluripotent stem cells that have demonstrated the ability to differentiate 
into numerous types of cells throughout the body, including in the brain.  Thus CB 
may provide a source of cells for non -hematopoietic tissue repair or regeneration.  
 
In this study, we propose to use allogeneic CB donor without the use of chemotherapy or 
other immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
2.4.2  Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  
MSCs are a heterogeneous group of undifferentiated, pluripoten t cells that can be 
isolated from several different tissues including bone marrow, adipose tissue, and birth 
tissues (umbilical cord tissue, placenta).  While MSCs can give rise to mesodermal 
tissue types including bone, cartilage, and fat, their primary m echanism of action is 
thought to result from immunomodulatory and other paracrine effects.  MSCs have 
demonstrated a multitude of immunomodulatory effects on both humoral and cell -
mediated immune responses.  These include, but are not limited to, inhibiting B -, T-, NK, 
dendritic -cell, and microglial proliferation, decreasing pro -inflammatory cytokine 
production, and blocking neutrophil recruitment.   In addition, numerous preclinical 
studies using MSCs transplantation for diseases of the central ner vous system suggest 
that MSCs can act through release of different neurotrophic, anti -inflammatory, and anti -
apoptotic factors to promote recovery the injured area and prevent further damage.22-[ADDRESS_146000], in a review of 13 human studies of 
intravenous allogeneic MSC administration, including 1,012 mostly adult patients, there 
were no reports of infusional tox icity,27 supporting the notion that MSCs are “immune -
privileged” and can avoid immunological allorecognition.  When utilized as a therapeutic 
cell, MSCs exert effects via  trophic signaling.  It is estimated that after infusion, MSC s 
survive in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_129366] 4 months.  MSC s do not engraft in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  
 
Safety of MSCs:  
MSCs manufactured from bone marrow and adipose tissue have been studied in 
hundreds of clini cal trials worldwide involving thousands of individuals and a wide variety 
of human conditions.  Their safety has been demonstrated repeatedly, and is 
summarized in a [ADDRESS_146001] reported arrhythmias, the incidence was not sta tistically 
different from control groups in meta -analysis.27  
 
Experience with MSCs in Children:  
The most well -studied MSC product given to children to date is a bone marrow -derived 
product originally manufactured by [CONTACT_129402]® and subsequently acquired by 
[CONTACT_129403] -L used to treat patients with GvHD  after a hematopoietic 
stem cell transplant.  Prochymal® was approved in Canada in [ADDRESS_146002] enrolled 241 children (median age 9.6 years) with re fractory GvHD from 2007 -
2014.29  Eight MSC doses (2x106 cells/kg/d ose) were given intravenously over a four 
week time period, with four additional weekly infusions in patients who demonstrated a 
partial or mixed response.  There were no incidences of ectopic tissue formation in [ADDRESS_146003] frequent severe adverse events were 
infections (24%) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_17744] (16%), common issues in post -transplant 
patients.  There were only 11 severe adverse events and one infusion reaction related to 
MSC treatment.  Patients with prim ary steroid -refractory GvHD who had only been 
treated with steroids demonstrated an 81% response rate to MSCs.  Overall, 65% of 
patients demonstrated an improvement in their GvHD, with higher response rates in 
patients with less severe disease.  This demon strates that repeated doses of MSCs are 
safe and well -tolerated in children, and suggests that they provide anti -inflammatory and 
immunomodulatory effects in the setting of GvHD.  
 
In a recent study, a German group pooled bone marrow cells from eight health y donors 
to create an MSC cell bank.30  They treated 26 children, ages 1 -19 years old with 
steroid -refractory GvHD, with a total of 81 do ses of MSCs from this cell bank (median 3 
doses per patient, median 2.2x106/kg MSCs IV per dose).  Treatment was well -tolerated, 
with only one reported headache and one epi[INVESTIGATOR_129367].   Six 
patients died from causes unrelated to MSC tr eatment (disease progression, GvHD, 
sepsis, thromboembolism).  Seventy -seven percent of patients responded to therapy, 
defined as a complete or partial remission of their GvHD.  
 
Others are investigating the use of MSCs in patients with other conditions.  There have 
been case reports of intracoronary administration of autologous bone marrow -derived 
MSCs in children, ages 4 months to 14 years, with severe dilated cardiomyopathy and/or 
heart failure with subsequent short - and intermediate -term improvement in clinical 
condition and B -type natriuretic peptide values.31-[ADDRESS_146004] demonstrated  both neurological and survival benefits of 
cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_129368], ischemia, and intracranial hemorrhage.37-40 These 
injuries differ in that some are focal ( i.e. stroke) and others are global ( i.e. hypoxia), but 
all are typi[INVESTIGATOR_129369] a cascade of events that lead to demyelination and necrosis 
of brain tissue.  Inflammation, apoptosis , neuronal and oligodendrocyte death, and 
astrocytosis are all operative in mediating damage resulting from these insults. 
Neuroprotection, neovascularization, and neuronal regeneration have all been 
demonstrated after cell administration in various models .15,37,41  
2.5.1  Animal Studies in Hypoxic/Ischemic Brain Injury  
Cellular  therapy has been studied in models of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). 
In a neonatal rat model that results in severe cerebral damage and contralateral spastic 
paresis after unilateral carotid artery ligation on day seven of life, intraperitoneal CB  
mononuclear cells administered one day after the hypoxic event migrate to the area of 
brain damage and persist for at least two weeks.  Although the extent of morphologic 
injury on gross pathology was not altered, animals who received CB mononuclear cells  
did not develop spastic paresis, indicating functional recovery.39  In a baby [CONTACT_129404],42 Tan demonstrated that human CB ad ministered nine 
days after the injury improved gross motor function in functional assays  (figure 1) .[ADDRESS_146005] was also observed, with less improvement detected at lower doses.

2.5.3  Animal Studies in Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH)  
Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is common in preterm babies and often results in

and colleagues developed a rabbit model of IVH by [CONTACT_129409] y to premature rabbit pups.50  In this model, IVH is followed by [CONTACT_129410].  
Intraventricular administration of human CB cells 24 and 72 hours after glycerol failed to 
prevent the hydrocephalus, but did reduce subsequent demyelination (Ballabh, personal 
communication, 2014).   In a neonatal rat model of IVH in duced by [CONTACT_129411], mice given umbilical cord tissue -derived MSCs

AlloCB and hCT -MSC in Cerebral Palsy  
 
April 1, [ADDRESS_146012] 184 patients were 
described in 2010 as a Phase I study.61  Between 3/2004 and 12/2009, [ADDRESS_146013] blood infusions at Duke (14 patients received two 
infusions based on availability of larger cell doses).  Autologous CBUs were obtained 
from [ADDRESS_146014] blood banks:  149 (81%) CBUs came from 11 private U.S. banks 
(113 from two of the larger private U.S. b anks), 13 (7%) CBUs from 11 international 
banks, and 22 (12%) CBUs from 2 public banks.  The majority of parents had elected to 
store their child’s cord blood privately when they were born.  The median volume of cord 
blood collected was 60 m L (range 5 -180 mL) and median TNC contained in the cord 
blood, as reported by [CONTACT_129413], was 4.7x108 
(range 0.3 -33.8x108) total nucleated cells and 1.8 x106 (range 0 -19.1 x106) CD34 cells.  
All infusions were administered through  a peripheral IV after premedication with oral 
Tylenol 15mg/kg, IV Benadryl 0.5mg/kg and IV Solumedrol 0.5mg/kg.  Median post thaw 
recovery of TNC was 82% (range 13 -200%), and patients were dosed with a median of 
2.0x107 TNC/kg (range 0.1 -13.3x107), 0.7x105 CD34+ cells/kg (range 0.04 -6.4x105), and 
6.5x104 CFU/kg (range 0 -315x104).   
 
Three patients (1.5%) experienced  hypersensitivity  reactions during their CB infusion 
characterized by [CONTACT_129414].  The reactions resolved after discontinuation of the infusion and 
treatment with additional IV  Benadryl and bronchodilators. The remainder of the CB cells 
were discarded for two of the infusions stopped prior to completion; one patient was  able 
to restart  and complete the CB infusion. One patient’s mother experienced an allergic 
reaction consisting of urticaria, presumably due to contact [CONTACT_129415] a CB infusion. The reactio n resolved with oral 
Benadryl. No adverse events have been reported.  Specifically, no infections, 
autoimmune diseases, tumors, or other adverse events have been observed.   
 
This series demonstrated safety and feasibility of autologous CB infusion, and an ecdotal 
reports of improved function were common.  However, there was potential for a 
considerable placebo effect as parents often endorsed dramatic benefi t even shortly 
after infusion. Therefore, a randomized, double blind, placebo -controlled trial was 
performed to evaluate objective functional outcome s. This study is described in detail 
below.  
2.6.3  CB Infusion in Babies with Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)  
In phase I trial of newborns with HIE at birth conducted at Duke, fresh, non -
cryopreserved au tologous CB processed on Sepax 1 (Biosafe, Geneva) was infused in 
1, 2, or [ADDRESS_146015] 72 hours of life in babies with moderate -to-severe 
encephalopathy qualifying for systemic hypothermia.62  These babies (n=39) were 
compared to a concomitant group of babies who were also cooled at Duke but did not 
receive CB cells (n=146).  Infusions were found to be safe in these critically ill babies, 
and babies receiving cells had increased survival rates  to discharge (100% vs. 89%, 
p=0.03).  Of the 25 cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_129370] -year outcomes, 16 (64%) survived 
with Bayley III scores ≥ 85 in all three domains, and of the 63 cooled -only infants with 
known one year outcomes, 25 (40%) survived with Bayley  III scores ≥ [ADDRESS_146016] -MSC in Cerebral Palsy

April 1, 2019   Page 19 of 61 The CP -AC study was a 
prospective, randomized, 
double blind, placebo controlled 
crossover study of a single intravenous infusion of autologous CB in children ages 1-6 
years with cerebral palsy.63 The Gross Motor Classification System (GMFCS) was 
utilized to classify the level of motor  function  at study entry and follow -up. Children were 
eligible if they were (1) GMFCS level 2 -4 or (2) GMFCS level [ADDRESS_146017] a documented precryopreservation total cell dose of 1 -5x107/kg, negative sterility 
culture, and negative maternal  infectious disease screening. Subjects were evaluated at 
baseline, one -, and tw o-years with motor evaluations and brain MRI. They were 
randomized to the order in which they received CB and placebo inf usions (given one 
year apart). The primary endpoint was change in Gross Motor Functio n Measure -66 
(GMFM -66) score one year after the in itial infusion (CB or placebo). Infusions, dosed at 
1-5x107/kg based on the precryopreservation total nucleated cell count (TNCC), were 
administered intravenously over [ADDRESS_146018] -infusion.  
 
Results:  Sixty -three patients were enrolled and randomized to an initial infusion of 
autologous CB (n=32) or placebo (n=31). Median age at initial infusion was 2.1 years.  
Etiology of CP was classified  into the following categories:  periventricular leukomalacia 
(n=17), in utero  stroke or bleed (n=27), ischemic injury (n=7), or other (n=12). One-third 
of patients had moderately severe GMFCS l evels (III -IV) at study entry. The two 
treatment groups were balanced with respect to age, gender, race, type a nd severity of 
cerebral palsy. Patient and CB charact eristics are shown in Table 1. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_129371]-cryopreservation cultures,  one CB unit grew β-hemolytic strep  at the time of thaw. 
There were no clinical infections. One subject had transient infusion reactions consisting 
of hives +/ - low-grade fever after each infusion; an additional dose of Benadryl was 
administered after the first reaction.   
 
Analysis of the 63 patients at one year showed no difference in GMFM -66 change 
scores between placebo and treated groups (6.9 vs. 7.5, p=0.72).  However, treated 
subjects who received above the median infused cell dose of 1.98x107/kg dem onstrated 
improvement in GMFM -66 change scores compared to subjects who received lower cell 
doses ( p=0.05) (Figure 3).  The infused cell dose was not correlated with age (p=0.70) or 
type ( p=0.32) or severity (p=0.46) of cerebral palsy.

66 change scores based on median cell doses (Precryopreservation doses: Low, <3 x107/kg vs. 
High, >=3 x107/kg; Infused doses: < 1.98x107/kg vs. High: >= 1.98x107/kg). Panel C: One year 
Observed -Expected GMFM -66 scores in patients >2 years of age at base line based on infused 
cell dose.  Panel D: PDMS -[ADDRESS_146020]’s baseline GMFM -66 score, GMFCS level, age, and published 
percentiles,64 we calculated the expected one -year GMFM -66 score for each patient.  
Since such percentile values are only available for children ages ≥2 years, one -year ol d 
subjects (n=25) were excluded from this analysis.  In the evaluable patients (n=38), the 
difference between the actual one -year GMFM -66 score and the expected one -year 
GMFM -66 score was then calculated.  In the entire autologous CB group, the median 
actual-expected difference in GMFM -66 scores was 1.7 (range -6.1-14.5), versus 2.2 
(range -6.2-12.6) in the placebo group.  When the CB group was analyzed by [CONTACT_129417], subjects who received above the median infused cell dose of 1.98x107/kg 
(n=9) improved a median of 4.3 points greater  than expected (p=0.05 vs placebo), 
whereas subjects who received below the median infused dose improved a median of 
1.9 points less than expected (p=0.02 vs high dose; p=0.07 vs placebo , figure 3C ). 
 
We the n used the two year data to further explore the effect of cell dose by [CONTACT_129418] -66 scores one year after CB 
infusion in all subjects who were ≥2 years old when they were treated (n=46), regardless 
of when the infusion was given (baseline or one year). In this analysis, the dose 
relationship from the primary analysis was confirmed:  subjects who received ≥2x107 
cells/kg (n=23) improved a median 3.6 points (IQR -0.4 to 4.5) greater  than expected, 
whereas subj ects who received <2x107/kg did not improve beyond expectation (median  
-1.1, IQR -3.7 to 1.3, p=0.003, figure 4A).  
 

AlloCB and hCT -MSC in Cerebral Palsy  
 
April 1, 2019   Page 21 of 61 Fifty patients were also eligible for analysis of the Peabody Developmental Motor 
Scales -2 (PDMS -2), which assesses motor skills in childre n from birth through age [ADDRESS_146021] initial treatment . The median one -year change from baseline i n the Gross 
Motor Quotient was 1 .0 in the autologous CB group and -0.5 in the placebo group 
(p=0.39 ).  When the subjects treated with autologous CB were analyzed by [CONTACT_129419] (>/< 1.98x107/kg), a significant change was detected in the G ross Motor Quotient 
both at one year post -randomization (figure 3D) and one year post -CB infusion, 
regardless of the timing of the infusion ( 3.0 vs. 0, p= 0.02 , figure 4B ).  
 
 
 
Imaging Results:  MRI data was analyzed to explore relationships between change in 
GMFM -[ADDRESS_146022] of subjects due to 
substantial morphologic brain abnormalities, leaving 23 treated patients and 15 placebo 
patients with usable connectivity data.   There were no statistically significant differ ences 
in type  of cerebral palsy , GMFCS level, or age between patients with and without 
analyzable images. As previously described,65 there was a moderate correlation 
between change in GMFM -66 score and  total connectivity at one -year in all analyzable 
subjects (n=38, Spearman r=0. 53; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.73; p<0.001 ). Total connectivity 
change was not related to baseline GMFCS level, typography of cerebral palsy , or 
gender, but was inversely correlated with age (Spearman r= -0.52; 95% CI: -0.72, -0.23; 
p=0.001).   In the two -year analysis when all evaluable subjects were examined by [CONTACT_129420], patients who received ≥2x107 TNCC/kg (n=19) demonstrated a statistically  
significant greater increase in normalized whole brain connectivity one year after 
treatment than children who received lower doses (n=19; p=0.04, figure 5).  In the 
sensorimotor network, nodes with significant increases in connectivity that correlated 
with improvement in GMFM -[ADDRESS_146023] -central gyri, basal 
ganglia, and brain stem.

autologous CB unit available, we conducted a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety 
of fully HLA -matched or h aploidentical allogeneic  sibling CB infusion in children with 
cerebral palsy  (ClinicalTrials.gov ID [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Fifteen children (9 female, 5 male), 
ages 1 -6, with spastic CP were enrolled and treated. Children were eligible if they were 
(1) GMFCS level  2-4 or (2) GMFCS level [ADDRESS_146026] a precryopreservation 
total nucl eated cell count (pTNCC) ≥2.5x107/kg, negative sterility cultures, negative

AlloCB and hCT -MSC in Cerebral Palsy  
 
April 1, 2019   Page 23 of 61 Participants were evaluated at baseline and 6 months with functional evaluations 
(GMFM, Peabody ), brain CT, and laboratory studies. On the day of infusion, sibling CB 
units were thawed and washed. After premedication with Tylenol, Benadryl and 
Solumedrol, participants received a dose of ≥2.5x107/kg cells, based on the pTNCC, 
intravenously over [ADDRESS_146027] -infusion.  
 
The median baseline age of participants was 3.7 y ears (range 1.4 -6). Sibling CB 
infusions had a median TNCC of 4.3x107/kg (range 1.8 -5.2) and median CD34 dose of 
0.6x105/kg (range 0.1 –1.8). Four CB infusions were full HLA matches, [ADDRESS_146028] (19/34) were attributed to common childhood 
infections, and none were related to the CB infusion. The only serious adverse event 
was unrelated to the infusion and occurred in a participant with a h istory of seizures who 
was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] a prolonged febrile seizure 5 months after CB infusion. Six months 
after infusion, participants improved a mean of 4.8 (SD 2.5) points on the GMFM -66 and 
1 (SD 2.9) point on the Peabody Gross Motor Quot ient. This  study confirms that p artially 
or fully -HLA matched allogenenic  sibling CB infusion is safe and feasible in young 
children with CP.  
2.6.6  Allogeneic Unrelated Donor CB  in Children with Cerebral Palsy   
A study of allogeneic CB was conducted in 105 Korean children with cerebral palsy.66  
This study had three groups:  allogeneic CB + cyclosporine + erythropoietin; 
erythropoietin alone; and a control group.  One severely affected patient died in her 
sleep 14 wee ks after CB administration, and this was determined to be unrelated to the 
CB infusion.  Eight other patients experienced serious adverse events requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (pneumonia –4, seizure –1, influenza –2, urinary tract infection –1), but the 
distributio n did not differ between groups.  Non -serious adverse events that were more 
common in the CB group were pneumonia and irritability.  At one year of follow -up, there 
were no reported prolonged or delayed serious adverse events.  The authors reported 
greater  improvements in cognitive and select motor functions in children who received 
CB and erythropoietin versus controls.  There was no CB -only group for comparison.   
  
The same group subsequently conducted a study of allogeneic CB versus placebo in [ADDRESS_146029] patients who received four or more infusions showed improvement in 
tone, motor, and/or cognitive function, but there was no control group for comparison.  In 
their series, factors that impacted treatment response included age, severity of brain 
dama ge, and number of CB infusions.  
 
AlloCB and hCT -MSC in Cerebral Palsy  
 
April 1, [ADDRESS_146030] been investigated 
in cerebral palsy in a few small studies in China.69-71  In one study, autologous bone 
marrow -MSCs were injected intrathecally  and/or into brain parenchyma of [ADDRESS_146031] tissue -derived MSCs.71  
Improvements in GMFM -88 scores were noted six months  after treatment.  Interestingly, 
the improvement within each member of the twin pair was correlated, suggesting a 
possible hereditary component to the response to therapy.    
2.6.8  Allogeneic CB in Stroke  
The CoBIS study was an IRB approved, FDA IND spons ored, prospective, open -label, 
multi -center, Phase 1 safety study of a single intravenous infusion of non -HLA matched, 
ABO matched, allogeneic  CB in 10 adults ages 18 -80 years old.  CB units were 
selected by [CONTACT_124940], blood type, and ability to supply a dose of 0.5 – 1.5 x 107 TNCC/kg.  
Eligible patients included those experiencing a recent, acute cortical, hemispheric, 
ischemic stroke in the m iddle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution as detected by [CONTACT_129424] a 
diffusion weighted abnormality and are enrolled if their National Institutes of Health 
Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is 8 -15 (right hemisphere) or 8 -18 (left hemisphere).  Participants 
who received tP A or undergo mechanical perfusion are eligible for inclusion. Participants 
were not pre -treated with immunosuppressive drugs. The primary endpoint was safety 
as assessed by [CONTACT_129425] [ADDRESS_146032] CB infusion.  Secondary outcome measures 
included Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), NIHSS, the Barthel Index (BI), and European 
Quality of Life (EQ -5D-3L), Patient Health Questionnaire Scale (PHQ8), Telephone 
Interview for Cognitive Statu s (TICS), and a self -reporting survey of rehabilitation 
therapy.  MRI was used to evaluate changes in the brain [ADDRESS_146033] (MultiStem) 
was recently conducted in 126 adult patients with stroke (65 treated, 61 placebo).73  
MSC therapy was well -tolerated.  While there was no difference between placebo and 
treated p atients in measures of stroke recovery, the treatment group had a lower rate of 
mortality and infections, associated with down regulation of inflammatory biomarkers  
including IL -6.  Patients who received MSCs earlier ([ADDRESS_146034] -stroke) demonstrated more favorable recovery than patients who received 
later treatment or placebo.     
2.6.10  Unrelated Donor Cells in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)  
At Duke, we are currently conducting a phase II randomized, double -blind, placebo  
controlled trial of autologous or allogeneic CB infusion in young children with ASD  
(DukeACT) .  Parti cipants are randomized to the order in which they receive CB and 
placebo infusions, given six months apart. Children who have an adequate autologous 
CB un it stored are assigned to receive an autologous CB infusion; those without an 
available autologous CB unit are assigned to receive an infusion of allogeneic, unrelated 
donor CB from the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank with the same donor screening and HLA 
matchi ng requirements set forth in this protocol .  
 
A blinded safety analysis was performed after the first [ADDRESS_146035] are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
CB (autologous or allogeneic) or pla cebo.  With up to [ADDRESS_146036] 2017, there were a to tal of 166 Adverse Events (AEs) reported in 100 
participants. One hundred and twenty -two events (73.5%) were Mild, 42 (25.3%) were 
Moderate, and 2 (1.2%) were Severe. Six events (3.6%) in 3 subjects (3.0% of enrolled 
patients, 4.4% of subjects reporting ev ents) were Related to study product. The six 
related events are coded as Immune System Disorders/ Allergic Reaction to Excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  
One Severe event reported as “Hypoxia, Transient” was r elated to an allergic reaction to 
the study product . The other  reported Severe event was a “Fall” Unrelated to the study 
product.   Overall, 22/ 38 subjects (57.9%) with an autologous cell source had AEs and 
40/62 (64.5%) of subjects with an allogeneic cell source had AEs , the vast majority of 
which were related to com mon childhood ailments . The most frequently occurring 
Unrelated events were: Pyrexia (16 events), Upper Respi[INVESTIGATOR_60623] (11 events), 
Otitis Media (8 events), and Aggression (8 events).  
In China, 37 autistic children, ages 3 -12 years, were enrolled i n a study utilizing 
allogeneic CB mononuclear cells (CBMNC) and/or umbilical cord -derived mesenchymal 
stem cells (UCMSC).74  The children were divided into three groups:  CBMNC (n=14), 
CBMNC+UCMSC (n=9), and control (n=14).  All children received standard rehabilitation 
therapy.  Cells were given in four doses, 5 -7 days apart, via intravenous and/or 
intrathecal administration.   In the cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], transient fever (5/23) was the only 
reported adverse event related to the therapy.  Compared to control patients at six 
months, they observed greater improvements in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale 
(CARS) in the CBMNC+UCMSC grou p and in the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI) 
in both cell groups.  This was a small, non -randomized study designed primarily to 
assess safety.  Nonetheless, the functional data suggests the potential for benefit.  
AlloCB and hCT -MSC in Cerebral Palsy  
 
April 1, [ADDRESS_146037] been conducted in patients with 
multiple sclerosis .  Of 25 patients with progressive multiple sclerosis treated with a single 
intrathecal injection of autologous bone marrow -derived MSCs, the di sease stabilized in 
half of patients over a one -year time period.75  Side effects, all transient and self -limited 
including low -grade fever, nausea/vomiting, lower limb weakness, and headache, were 
likely related to the intrathecal route of administration and were consistent with those 
reported from other small studies of  intrathecal MSC treatment in patients with multiple 
sclerosis.76,77 Another study that treated 10 patients with progressive visual deficits due 
to multiple sclerosis with a single intravenous dose of autologous bone marrow -derived 
MSCs demonstrated improvements in visual acuity, visual e voked response latency, and 
optic nerve area.78  
 
One clinical trial has been conducted in seven patients with Parkinson’s Disease who 
received a single dose of autologous bone marrow -derived MSCs transplanted to the 
subventricular zone using stereotaxic surgery.  With a follow -up of [ADDRESS_146038] Blood Bank (CCBB) is one of the largest public cord blood banks in 
the nation. Established in [ADDRESS_146039] blood, for use in transplants between unrelated donors and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. DUCOR D is 
approved for use in hematopoietic stem cell reconstitution for patients with disorders 
affecting the hematopoietic system that are inherited, acquired, or result from 
myeloablative treatment. The CCBB currently collects from 10 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129372] (8 in No rth 
Carolina, 1 in Atlanta, GA and 1 in [LOCATION_011], MA). It also accepts CB donations from 
mothers delivering in any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129373] a kit donation 
program.  
2.[ADDRESS_146040] Blood Bank, another accredited bank may be used to locate a 
matching CB unit with the following criteria listed below:      
 
The CB unit must have:  
 
1. Pre-cryopreservation total nucleated cell count (TNCC) documented and at le ast 
12 x 107/kg.  We target CB units that are at least 12  x 107/kg, however, we will 
accept units that are at least 10 x 107/kg.       
2. Pre-cryopreservation viability ≥85% of total cells and ≥70% of CD34+ cell s (if 
performed)   
3. Pre-cryopreservation sterility  culture performed and negative  
AlloCB and hCT -MSC in Cerebral Palsy  
 
April 1, 2019   Page 27 of 61 4. Maternal infectious disease screening as follows:  Testing must include negative 
results for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, HTLV, and syphilis.  Additional 
screening, which is dependent on the timing of the CB collection, ma y be 
performed based on local and national regulations. Units from mothers who have 
a positive CMV antibody screen may be used.   
5. Test sample available for identity confirmation and potency testing  
6. HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_129374] -specific parameters  
7. CD45+ viability ≥40% and CD34+ viability ≥70% on thawed test sample  
 
These same criteria will be utilized for this clinical trial and, along with procedures for CB 
administration, are detailed again in section 6.0.  
2.9 Source of MSCs  for this Study:  hCT -MSC 
hCT-MSC is a third party MSC  product manufactured from allogeneic donor digested 
umbilical cord tissue that is expanded for two passages in culture, cryopreserved, stored 
in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen, and banked.  The umbilical cord tissue is donated 
by [CONTACT_129426]  a normal pregnancy with  
written informed consent.  The cells are manufactured, cryopreserved and stored in the 
Robertson CT2 GMP laboratory (Duke  University, Durham, NC).  
 
Umbilical cord tissue is an attractive source of MSCs as it is readily available and easily 
obtained without consequence to the donor, is non -controversial, has a higher 
proliferative potential than MSCs from other postnatal sou rces.[ADDRESS_146041] (clinicaltrials.gov).

April 1, [ADDRESS_146045] size of change in motor 
function of these two cell sources  and a natural history cohort  to aid in the planning of 
future trials. The rationale for the study and for the potential benefit of cell therapy in 
cerebral palsy  is based upon the following hypotheses:  
  
 We have demonstrated safety and preliminary evidence  of potential dose -dependent 
efficacy of autologous CB infusion s in children with cerebral palsy . 
 It is possible that different cell types, e.g. cord blood mononuclear cells versus cord 
tissue MSCs, may influence brain connectivity by [CONTACT_129427].  
 Multiple doses of cells may be superior to a single dose of cells.  
 The developi[INVESTIGATOR_129376], making young children ideal 
candidates for deriving maximal therapeutic benefit from restorative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
including CB.  
 CB cells, acting through paracrine mechanisms, may facilitate endogenous repair 
mechanisms and promote formation of new neural connections the motor cortex 
result ing in significant clinical improvements.  
 Brain connectivity plays an important role in the pathophysiology, and potentially 
mechanism of repair, of brain injury in children with cerebral palsy.  Specifically, we 
hypothesize that (1) impairments in brain c onnectivity account for the motor deficits 
in children with cerebral palsy, (2) increases in brain connectivity have a direct 
impact on functional improvements, (3) children with cerebral palsy who receive CB 
infusions will exhibit greater increases in bra in connectivity than children who receive 
placebo infusions, and (4) the severity of baseline brain connectivity abnormalities 
predict the potential for benefit of CB therapy.   
2.11 Study Design  
This study is a phase I/II, prospective, randomized, open -label  trial designed to assess 
the effect size of change in GMFM -[ADDRESS_146046]  at some point 
during  the study.  Participants will be randomized to one of three arms:  (1) the “AlloCB” 
arm will receive one allogeneic CB infusion at the baseline visit; (2) the “MSC” arm will 
receive three hCT -MSC infusions, one each at baseline, three months, and six mont hs; 
(3) the “natural history” arm will not receive an infusion at baseline but will receive an 
allogeneic CB infusion at [ADDRESS_146047] an initial clinical 
evaluation to verify and classify the diagnosis of cerebral palsy and determ ine eligibility.  
They  will return for study visits an additional two (AlloCB and natural history arms) or 
three (MSC arm) times .  Outcome measures, described in detail in section 7.6, will be 
assessed at baseline , six-months,  and one -year time points.  Additional safety  endpoints  
will be  assessed  remotely for [ADDRESS_146048] 
(rash, shortness of breath, w heezing, difficulty breathing, hypotension, swelling around 
the mouth, throat or eyes, tachycardia, diaphoresis) to the product or transmission of 
infection.  Additional risks associated with infusion of allogeneic CB cells include 
hypertension, bradycardi a, anaphylaxis, hematuria, acute hemolytic reaction, rejection of 
cells, immune dysregulation (develop of HLA directed antibodies), and development of 
graft-versus -host disease.  All CB units are screened for the risk of transmitting 
infectious agents  and must meet release criteria prior to infusion, as described below.  
Participants must have normal immune function and will not receive immunosuppressive 
therapy prior to or after infusion of CB  or hCT -MSC .   
 
Potential risks associated with MSC infusion include a reaction to the product (rash, 
shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hypotension, swelling of the mouth, 
throat or eyes, tachycardia, diaphoresis), infection  transmission , and HLA sensitization.  
Theoretical risks that must be cons idered but have not been associated with MSC 
administration include the possibility of immune suppression and ectopic tissue 
formation.  CB collected with the cord tissue used to manufacture hCT -MSC is screened 
for the risk of transmitting infectious agent s, and the product must meet release criteria 
prior to infusion, as described below.  Participants  must have normal immune function 
and will not receive immunosuppressive therapy prior to or after infusion of hCT -MSC.   
 
Participants who undergo a brain MR I may  require moderate sedation or, rarely, general 
anesthesia, in order to complete the MRI and infusion.  Risks associated with anesthesia 
include nausea, vomiting, blood vessel injury, nerve injury, lung injury, heart attack, 
allergy to medications, bra in damage, respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448], hypoxia, hypotension, 
and anaphylaxis, and death.  These associated risks are described in detail in the 
consent form. Risks associated with blood draws and IVs include momentary discomfort 
or pain, bruising, infection , bleeding, clotting, and fainting.  Risks associated with genetic 
testing include medical, psychosocial, and economic risks, effects on insurability and 
employability, limits on educational options, and social stigma.      
 
Potential benefits of this inte rvention include the possibility that the cells may, via direct 
or indirect mechanisms, induce changes  in vivo  that result in motor improvement.

CB Unit Characterization  
Results of initial testing at the cord blood bank must include a pre -cryopreservation 
TNCC, viability and sterility  culture.  Pre-cryopreservation TNCC must be ≥12x107/kg 
(we will accept units that are ≥10 x 107/kg) to target administration of 10x107 cells/kg 
post thaw , sterility  cultures must have been negative , total viability must have been 
≥85%, and  CD34+ cell viability  (if performed) must have been ≥70%.  
 
A test vial or segment must be available from each CB unit for potency  testing and 
confirmatory HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  The segment will be detached from the candidate unit and 
tested for potency and identity (HLA -confirmatory typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) per S tandard Operating 
Procedures  in the CCBB at Duke .  Units will be deemed acceptable for the trial if viability 
of the CD45 cell population is  ≥40% and viability of the CD34 cell population is ≥70%.  
CFU growth , expression of aldehydehydrogenase and CD34 will be described but will 
not be a specification for study enrollment.    
 
Prior to the patients’ arrival, their designated CB unit will be transferred from the 
Carolinas Cord Blood Bank  (or other accredited bank)  to the Duke STC L, located in the 
same building , where it will be stored in a liquid nitrogen freezer until the day of infusion.  
On the infusion day, the CB will be thawed and washed in  dextran/albumin and 
resuspended in an appropriate volume based on recipi[INVESTIGATOR_129379]115 per SOP STCL -PROC -036.  At the time of thawing, 
standard studies listed (see table)  will be performed.  Only TNCC is utilized for release.

6.[ADDRESS_146060] Tissue -derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hCT -MSC)  
hCT-MSCs are a product of allogeneic cells manufactured from digested umbilical cord 
tissue that is expanded in culture, cryopreserved and banked  (complete composition and 
manufacturing details available in IND [ZIP_CODE]) .  hCT -MSCs are manufactured  in the 
Duke CT2 GMP cell manufacturing lab  from umbilical cord tissue donated to the 
Carolinas Cord Blood B ank, an FDA -licensed, FACT -accredited, public cord blood bank 
at Duke University Medical Center, after written informed consent from the donor baby’s 
mother.   Cord tissue is harvested from the placentas of male babies delivered by 
[CONTACT_129431] C -section after a normal, full -term pregnancy.    Donor screening questionnaires 
are completed by [CONTACT_129432], and maternal blood is tested for communicable 
diseases by [CONTACT_129433] -certified donor screening laboratory in Charlotte, NC.   Donors 
must be eligible for donation to a public cord blood bank for allogeneic use.   After 
delivery of the placenta and cord, the cord blood is aseptically drained from the 
placenta.   Then the cord is dried and cleaned with chloropreps,  separated from the base 
of the placenta, placed in a sterile bottle containing Plasmalyte A, and transported to the 
Robertson CT2 GMP cell processing laboratory at room temperature in  a validated 
container.   
  
In the clean room manufacturing suite, in a b iosafety cabinet, the cord tissue is removed 
from the media, placed in sterile dishes, cut into small pi[INVESTIGATOR_129380] -grade 
enzymes:   hyaluronidase, DNase, collagenase, papain.   The resultant cell suspension is 
placed in culture in Prime XV MSC Expansion XSFM (Irvine Scientific) media with 1% 
platelet lysate and grown to confluence (~7 -14 days) to establish the P0 culture.   To 
establish the master cell bank, P0 is harvested and cryopreserved in cryovials with 
Cryostor 10 media (BioLife), and stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen.   P1 and P2 
cultures are grown under similar conditions, in HYPERFlasks  or HYPERStacks  without 
platelet lysate, as needed to create the working ce ll bank and product for administration, 
respectively. Cells from P1 and P2 are removed from plastic cultureware using TrypLE 
(Gibco). The final product is derived from the P2 cultures which are harvested into

cryobags containing 50 -100 million cells in a final concentration of 10% DMSO with 
dextran (Akron Scientific).   On the day of administration, one compartment is thawed, 
diluted in [ADDRESS_146061]-MSCs/kg based on the post thaw 
count.  
 
Process and Final Formulation  
hCT-MSC  is manufactured from a single umbilical cord tissue in a series of three steps 
that generate a master cell bank, a working cell bank, and the study product.  The 
product for each step is cryopreserved in a controlled rate freezer  and stored in the 
vapor p hase of liquid nitrogen. At P2, a representative cryobag is thawed and qualified 
prior to the treatment of any patients with that lot of product. Testing for product release  
include s total nucleated cell count, viability, phenotype, functional assays, endotoxin, 
mycoplasm a, gram stain and sterility. Each lot of cells is also tested for adventitial 
viruses  prior to cryopreservation .   
 
On the day of treatment, cells are thawed per SOP  STCLAOP -028 JA2 and then  diluted 
in 10 -40 m Ls of plasmalyte  A + 5% human serum albumin ( HSA).  An aliquot is removed 
for cell count, viability, and sterility culture.  If the cells are ≥70% viable, the final product 
volume is adjusted to deliver 2x106 cells/kg to the study subject.  The cells are delivered 
to the bedside in a syringe containing plasmalyte  A, 5% HSA, and residual DMSO.  Any 
removed cell suspension is inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles for 
sterility testing. The cells have a four -hour expi[INVESTIGATOR_129381] . 
 
The hCT -MSC final product will be released conditionally for administration to the patient 
after testing a post thaw cell count and viability.  Final release will occur after the [ADDRESS_146062], the organism will be identified and antibiotic

administered.  Allogeneic CB products  will be administered intravenously over [ADDRESS_146068] supervision.  Vital signs (heart rate, blood 
pressure, temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be checked upon arrival to the clinic and as 
clinically indicated.  Pulse oximetry will be monitored continuously throughout t he 
infusion and for at least [ADDRESS_146069] infusion.   
6.6 Safety Follow -up 
On Day 1 following the infusion, the participant will be seen by [CONTACT_129435]. At ~[ADDRESS_146070] the parent or guardian via phone or email  to 
assess patient status and any adverse events. In-person safety assessments will occur 
at each study visit.  In addition, a questionnaire (see Appendix 1) will be administered at 
6, 12, and [ADDRESS_146071] baseline visit  to assess for serious adverse eve nts.  
7.0 STUDY PLAN  
7.1 Overview   
Parents/Guardians who have previously contact[CONTACT_129436] a child who 
may meet eligibility criteria for this study will be notified that this study is available. After 
initial contact, parents/guardians of potential research participants will ha ve an initial 
phone interview with study personnel to describe the study, verify basic eligibility criteria, 
and confirm their interest in participation. The participant’s eligibility will then be 
screened through review of medical records, video, laborato ry testing, and imaging 
under a separate screening protocol.  
Once all screening is complete and the patient is likely to meet study criteria , a suitable 
AlloCB and hCT -MSC in Cerebral Palsy  
April 1, [ADDRESS_146072] study infusions as determined by [CONTACT_129437] (at baseline only for AlloCB; at 12 -months only for Natural History; at 
baseline, 3 -, and 6 -months for MSCs).  Participants will be evaluated th e day after each  
infusion , and parents will be contact[CONTACT_129438] -up ~2 weeks after each 
infusion. All p articipants will return to Duke six (motor assessments) and 12 months  
(motor assessments and brain MRI)  after the baseline visit.  Part icipants on the MSC 
arm will also return at three months for an hCT -MSC infusion.  A remote safety 
assessment  will be performed via phone or email at [ADDRESS_146073] -infusion.   
7.2  Patient Screening  
Initial patient screening will be conducted with informed consent under a separate 
protocol and will include a review of medical records, videos, and initial laboratory 
testing. If no exclusion criteria are identified, informed consent will be obtained , and the 
patient  will be randomized to a treatment arm.   If indicated (AlloCB and Natural History 
arms), an unrelated donor CB unit will be identified at the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank , or 
other accredited cord blood bank .  Participants will travel to Duke for initial evaluation. 
Evaluations and treatments will be conducted in the outpatient setting. A physical exam 
and baseline GMFCS  assessment  will be conducted to confirm eligibility, and the 
participant undergo the remainde r of the study evaluations.

available HLA -matched CB unit with a pre -cryopreservation nucleated cell dose ≥1 2x107 
cells/kg will be chosen.   We target CB units that are at least 12x107 cells/k g, however, 
we will accept units that are at least 10x107 cells/k g.  When possible, at least [ADDRESS_146075] will be prepared by [CONTACT_941] S TCL and 
provided for infusion of the patient in the outpatient clinic  under the supervision of the 
study team and Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Program staff.  A peripheral IV 
will be placed by [CONTACT_45914] , anesthesia  or a member of the study tea m.  Prior to the 
study infusion, premedications ( Benadryl  and Solumedrol) will be administered.  CB cells 
will have a four -hour expi[INVESTIGATOR_129382] -thaw.  
 
Allo CB  infusion will be given over approximately 5-[ADDRESS_146076] one hour providing 
all vital signs are at their baseline and they  are awake  and asymptomatic with no  
evidence of toxicity.  P atients will be evaluated by [CONTACT_129439] -related adverse reactions or complications.  A phone call to 
parents/guardians by [CONTACT_129440] t he infusion will be conducted two 
weeks after the infusion.

postponed.  
7.5 Care During Unexpected Events  
In the event that a patient develops signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis including urticaria, 
difficulty breathing, cough, wheezing, or vomiting during their CB infusion, the infusion 
will b e terminated and appropriate medical therapy initiated.  
7.6  Motor Assessments  
Gross Motor Function Measurement -66 (GMFM -66):  The GMFM -[ADDRESS_146077] been published for children ages 2 – 12 years,64,116 allowing for the 
calculation of future expected scores based on the baseline age, GMFCS level, and 
GMFM -66 score.  The GMFM -66 consists of 66 items, divided into five categories: lying 
and rolling, sitting, crawling and kneel ing, standing, and walking, running, and jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
Each item is scored on a four -point Likert scale.  The GMFM -[ADDRESS_146078] been valida ted in children with cerebral palsy from 
5 months to 16  years of age.  A 5 -year old child without motor disabilities is able to reach 
the maximum score.117  A computer program, the Gross Motor Ability Estimator, is used 
to calculate the GMFM -66 total scores.  The primary endpoint of this study is the 
difference between a child’s actual and expected changes in GMFM -66 score 12 months 
after the initial study i nfusion.  Control (placebo) and treated patients will be compared.  
When possible, the entire GMFM -88 will be performed, and subsets may be analyzed as 
exploratory endpoints.  
 
Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (PDMS -2):  The PDMS -II is a standardized 
asse ssment of early childhood motor development that evaluates both gross and fine 
motor skills. It is designed for children from birth through 5 years of age.  The 
assessment is composed of six subtests that measure interrelated motor abilities that 
develop ea rly in life (i.e., reflexes, stationary, locomotion, object manipulation, graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
and visual -motor integration). Gross Motor Quotient, Fine Motor Quotient, and Total 
Motor Quotient composite scores are obtained.  For this study, the Gross Motor Quotient 
will be obtained and analyzed as a secondary endpoint.  
AlloCB and hCT -MSC in Cerebral Palsy  
April 1, [ADDRESS_146079] ( PEDI -CAT):  The 
PEDI -CAT measures abilities in three functional domains:  Daily Activities, Mobility, and 
Social/Cognitive.  The computerized adaptive version is intended to provide an accurate 
and precise assessment of a child’s abilities while increasing efficiency and reducing 
respondent burden by [CONTACT_129441].     
7.8 Imaging  Assessments  
Participants’ brain imaging obtained previously as standard of care will be reviewed by a 
member of the Brain Imaging Analysis Center (BIAC) team to determine if a ccurate 
anatomical image parcellation would be likely on a brain MRI.  Those participants for  
whom usable data is likely to be obtained (estimated as approximately two -thirds of 
eligible participants) will undergo brain MRI with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).  Diffusion 
weighted images will be acquired on a 3  Tesla GE scanner (Waukesha, WI). T1-
weighted images will be obtained with an inversion -prepared 3D fast spoiled -gradient -
recalled (FSPGR) pulse sequence.  These images will be analyzed to obtain measures 
of whole brain connectivit y.

April 1, 2019   Page 43 of 61 8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
8.1 Study Design  
This study is a phase I/II, prospective, randomized, open -label  trial designed to provide 
interval estimates of the [ADDRESS_146080] -MSC, provide additional da ta to the clinical trials community on the natural 
history of the motor function in CP over short -term (less than 1 year) time periods 
relevant to conduct of clinical trials, and assess the safety of repeated doses of hCT -
MSC and a single dose of AlloCB in children with cerebral palsy . 
Children ages [ADDRESS_146081]  at some point during the study.  
Participants will be randomized  (1:1:1)  to one of three arms:  (1) the “AlloCB” arm will 
receive one allogeneic CB infusion at the baseline visit; (2) the “MSC” arm will receive 
three hCT -MSC infusions, one each at  baseline, three months, and six months; the 
“natural history” arm will not receive an infusion at baseline but will receive an allogeneic 
CB infusion at [ADDRESS_146082] -randomiz ation in all participants. Motor function outcome 
measures will be assessed at baseline, six -months, and one -year time points in all 
participants.  Duration of  study participation will be 24 months from the time of the 
baseline visit.  Randomization will b e stratified by [CONTACT_129442] (I/II or III/IV)  and 
etiology of CP (Stroke vs. Other).  
8.[ADDRESS_146083]’s participation in the study will be [ADDRESS_146084] patient 39 months (3.25 years) after the study opens.  
8.4 Primary and Secondary Endpoint s 
The primary  endpoint of this study is the difference between a child’s observed  and 
expected changes in GMFM -[ADDRESS_146085] -MSC in Cerebral Palsy  
April 1, 2019   Page 44 of 61 As shown in the t able below, a sample size of 30 patients per group provides a 95.8% 
probability of detecting common adverse events that occur in 10% of infusions (with 
hCT-MSC or AlloCB). This sample size also provides a 78.5% probability of observing 
events that occur in  5% of infusions, and a 26.0% probability of observing rare events 
that occur in 1% of infusions.  
 
Probability of Observing One or More Events with Various Sample Sizes*

*Binomial probability of [ADDRESS_146086] -intervention with MSC,

using the t -distribution as follows.  
(𝑥̅−𝑡𝛼2⁄∗𝑠
√𝑛,𝑥̅+𝑡𝛼2⁄∗𝑠
√𝑛)  
 
The margin of  error E is the confidence interval half -width:  
𝐸=𝑡𝛼2⁄∗𝑠
√𝑛 
 
The margin of error for this study was selected as 2 points with a confidence level of 
95%. The following formula was solved iteratively  to obtain the sample size for each 
treatment group.  
 
𝑁=(𝑡𝛼2⁄∗𝑠
𝐸)[ADDRESS_146087] deviation, s, was estimated  using 36 participants in the CP -AC trial who 
met age and GMFCS inclusion criteria for the present study: 5.16 (95% CI: 4.18, 6. 13). 
 
Starting with a sample size of 20, and assuming a standard deviati on of 5.16, a total of 3 
iterations were required to reach a final group sample size of 28 as shown in the table 
below.  
Iteration #  Starting N  Degrees of Freedom  𝒕𝜶𝟐⁄ Ending N  
[ADDRESS_146088] -MSC in Cerebral Palsy  
April 1, 2019   Page 45 of 61  
Therefore, a group size of 28  patients allows for 9 5% confidenc e in the estimation of the 
mean  12-month observed -minus -expected GMFM -66 change score in one of the study 
arms (Natural History , MSC or AUCB) with a margin of error of no more than 2.  This 
sample size is also con cordant with what is required (N=30) for reasonable probability of 
detecting commonly occurring adverse events, as described above. Finally, i f the 
standard deviation of the secondary outcome measure is as high as that indicated by [CONTACT_129443] 9 5% confidence interval from the CP -AC study (6.13 points) then a 
sample of 126 patients allows for a margin of e rror no larger than ~2.5 points for each of 
the three interval estimates.    
 
The total sample size for this study is therefore set at 90 evaluable patients (30 per 
group).

8.6.3 Demographics, Baseline Characteristics, and Disposition  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all research 
participants and separately by [CONTACT_129444]. Characteristics to be examined 
include age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline GMFM -66 score, GMFCS level, and etiology of 
CP. The number of participants entering and completing the study will be diagrammed 
using the CONSORT guidelines.  
8.6.4 Analysis of the Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
The occurrence of adverse events in the Safety Population will be summarized 
descriptively in tables and figures for all subjects and separately by [CONTACT_82153].  
Estimates of the mean observed -minus -expected GMFM -66 change score at 12 months 
will be re ported in the Intention to Treat Population along with 95% confidence intervals 
as described above.

April 1, 2019   Page 46 of 61 9.0 SAFETY AND ADVER SE EVENT REPORTING  
9.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE) :  An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence  associated 
with the use of the investigational product regardless of whether it is considered related 
to the investigational product.   
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) :  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or  sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcomes:  death, a life threatening adverse event, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to condu ct normal life functions , or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect.   Important medical events that may not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may 
require medical or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  
 
Grade/Severity :  Grade/severity will be assessed according to CTCAE v4.0 guidelines.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction :  A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for 
which there is  a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused the 
adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the investigational product and the adverse event.  
 
Causality :  The investigator  will use the following question when assessing causality of 
an adverse event to the investigational product:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that 
the investigational product caused the event?”  An affirmative answer designates the 
event as a suspected  adverse reaction.  
9.[ADDRESS_146090] be recorded.  Information to be reported includes when the site became 
aware of the event, investigator -specified assessment of severity and relationship to 
study therapy, whether there is an alternative etiology, seriousness, as well as any 
required  treatment or evaluations, and outcome.  In general, investigators should report 
adverse events as diseases or syndromes whenever possible, instead of reporting 
individual component symptoms, signs, laboratory abnormalities, and sequelae.  
Severe adverse in fusion reactions (fatal, life -threatening or requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will 
be reported within seven calendar days of receipt of the information.   All fatal or life 
threatening SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_129445], following 
FDA guidelines.  All serious and unexpected AEs will be reported to the FDA via a 
written report within 15 days of receipt of the information (21 CFR 312.32).  If the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_129384], then the event will 
not require expedited reporting but will be included in the annual  summary report.  
The f ollowing events within [ADDRESS_146091]  infusion will be also be recorded in

Study results will be retained in the patient’s rese arch record for six years after the study 
is completed or until the  patient reaches the age of 21, whichever is longer.  Essential 
documents should be retained until at least two years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) region and 
until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at 
least two years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of 
the investigational product.  These documents should be retained for a longer period, 
however, if required by [CONTACT_1214].

April 1, 2019   Page 49 of 61 kept in a secure  storage area with limited access.  Clinical information will not be 
released without the written permission of the research participant’s guardian except as 
necessary for monitoring and auditing.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator and all empl oyees and coworkers involved 
with this study may not disclose or use for any purpose other than performance of the 
study, any data, record, or other unpublished, confidential information disclosed to those 
individuals for the purpose of the study.   
12.[ADDRESS_146098] Approval  
Federal regulations and the ICH guidelines require that approval be obtained from an 
IRB prior to participation of human research participants in research studies.  Prior to the 
study onset, the protocol, informed consent , any advertisement used to recruit study 
patients, and any other written information regarding this study to be provided to the 
research participant or the research participant’s legal guardian must be approved by [CONTACT_5040].   
All IRB approvals should be si gned by [CONTACT_129452], the clinical protocol by [CONTACT_29985]/or protocol number, and the 
date the approval and/or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_11744].  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator is respon sible for obtaining continued 
review of the clinical research at intervals not exceeding one year or otherwise specified 
by [CONTACT_1201].  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator must supply the Sponsor or its 
designee with written documentation of conti nued review of the clinical research.  
12.[ADDRESS_146099] be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_5040].   
12.4 Informed Consent  
A written informed consent in compliance with Part 50 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) and Institutional IRB shall be obtained from each research participant 
prior to entering the study or performing any unusual or non -routine procedure that 
involves risk to the research participant.   
Before enrollment, each prospective research participant and/or his/her legal guardian 
will be given a full explanation of the study and be allowed to read the approved 
informed consent form.  Once the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator is assured 
that the research participant/legal guardian understands the implications of participating 
in the study, the research participant/legal guardian will be asked to give consent to 
participate in  the study by [CONTACT_1725].  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator shall provide a signed/dated copy  of the 
signed informed consent to the research participant and/or legal guardian.   
12.[ADDRESS_146100] document and explain in 
the research participant’s source documentation any deviation from the approved 
protocol.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator may implement a deviation from, 
AlloCB and hCT -MSC in Cerebral Palsy  
April 1, [ADDRESS_146101] to study research 
participants without prior IRB approval.  As soon as possible after such an occurrence, 
the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol 
amend ment(s) should be submitted to the IRB for review and approval, to the Sponsor 
for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required.  
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes  approved by [CONTACT_129453] [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator.  Deviations usually have an impact on 
individual research participants or a small group of research participants and do not 
involve inclusion/exclusion or  primary endpoint criteria.  A protocol violation occurs when 
there is nonadherence to the protocol that results in a significant, additional risk to the 
research participant, when the research participant or Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -
Investigator has failed to adhere to significant protocol requirements (inclusion/exclusion 
criteria) and the research participant was enrolled without prior Sponsor approval, or 
when there is nonadherence to FDA regulations and/or ICH GCP guidelines.  
The IRB should be not ified of all protocol violations and deviations in a timely manner as 
required  by [CONTACT_779]’s IRB . 
12.6 Study Reporting Requirements  
By [CONTACT_6231], the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator agrees to 
submit reports of serious adverse ev ents according to the timeline and method outlined 
in the protocol.  In addition, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator agrees to 
submit annual reports to his/her IRB as appropriate.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -
Investigator also agrees to p rovide the Sponsor with an adequate report shortly after

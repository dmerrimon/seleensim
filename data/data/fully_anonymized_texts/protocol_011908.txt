Bioavailability of Dexlansoprazole Capsules Manufactured by [CONTACT_437607] a High -Fat Meal
Trial Design:
This is a phase 1, randomized, open -label, single -center, single -dose, 2 -part, 2-wa y crossover bioavailability (BA ) 
study to compare the BA of 30 or60mg dexlansoprazole capsules manufactured at [COMPANY_005] GmbH Plant Oranienburg 
(TOB ) to the corresponding 30 and or 60 mg dexlansoprazole capsules manufactured at [COMPANY_005] Pharmaceutical 
Company Ltd. ( TPC) plant in Osaka, Japan under fed conditions. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1, 
60healthy  subjects will receive dexlansoprazole 30 mg capsules manufactured by [CONTACT_437608] a crossover 
fashion. In Part 2, an additional 60healthy  subjects will receive dexlansoprazole 60 mg capsules manufactured by 
[CONTACT_437608] a crossover fashion. Due to the difference between the Granules -L used in the 30 mg (Granules -LL) 
and 60 mg (Granules -LS) capsules, the relative BA of both dosage strengths will be assessed. 
Subjects who satisfy the Screening evaluation and selection criteria may be enrolled in the study. For each part, eligible subjects will be rando mized on Day 1 of Period 1 in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 sequences, which defines the order in 
which they will receive dexlansoprazole regimens in Periods 1 and 2. The dosing between p eriods will be separated by 
a minimum 5 -day washout interval. During Periods 1 and 2, blood samples will be collected predose and over 24 hours 
postdose to measure dexlans oprazole plasma concentrations. The treatment sequences are outlined in the following

Main Criteria for Exclusion: 
The subject has a history of significant gastrointestinal (GI) disorders manifested with persistent, chronic or 
intermittent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or has a current or recent (within 6 months) GI disease that would influence 
the absorption of drugs (eg, a history of malabsorption, severe esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease or erosive 
esophagitis (EE) with frequent [more than once per week] occurrence of heartburn); or has consumed medications,certain foods, and supplements, including prescription and over -the-counter medications, within the 
protocol -specified time periods prior to Check -in (Day -1 of Period 1), or is unwilling to agree to abstain from these 
products. The subject must not have received dexlansoprazole in a previous clinical study or as a therapeutic agent 
within [ADDRESS_554456] a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of dexlansoprazole capsules or other drugs with the same mechanism of action (including lansoprazole, omeprazole, 
rabeprazole, pantoprazole, or esomeprazole), or related compounds; or any significant results from physical examination or clinical laboratory results that make the subject unsuitable for the study.
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
The primary endpoint sof the study arethe following plasma PK parameters of dexlansoprazole derived on Day 1 of 
each period:
Maximum observed concentration ( Cmax).
Area under the concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_554457] quantifiable concentration ( AUC last).
Area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC ∞).
Additional Endpoints
In addition, the following plasma PK parameters for dexlansoprazole will be calculated: time to first occurrence of C
max(tmax), 
terminal disposition phase half -life ( t1/2z), 
terminal disposition phase rate constant ( λz), 
apparent clearance after extravascular administration ( CL/F ), 
apparent volume of distribution during the terminal disposition phase after extravasc ular administration ( Vz/F).

Protocol –Amendment 1 09 January 2019
Statistical Considerations:
For each regimen of each part, dexlansoprazole plasma concentrations and PK parameter estimates will be tabulated 
and descriptive statistics computed.
For each part, analysis of variance ( ANOVA) will be performed on natural logarithms of dexlansoprazole C maxand 
area under the plasma concentration -time curve ( AUC )with factors for sequence, subject nested within sequence, 
period, and regimen. The factor of the subject nested within sequence will be the error term for testing the sequence effect. Other fact ors will be tested with the residual as the error term. For the relative BA determination, pairwise 
comparisons will be performed to assess the relative BA of dexlansoprazole via point estimates and 90% confidence intervals (CI) for the ratio of C
maxand A UC central values of the dexlansoprazole [ADDRESS_554458] regimen (dexlansoprazole capsule -TOB) and the reference regimen (dexlansoprazole 
capsule -TPC) will be reached if the 90% CIs for C maxand AUC are within the (0.80 –1.25) interval .
Statistical analyses of other plasma PK parameters will be performed, if appropriate.
Sample Size Justification:
For each part, a sample size of 60 (30 per sequence) will be used in this study. This sample size will allow for up to 
6dropouts ( 10% dropout rate) and provide 90% probability of concluding equivalence on dexlansoprazole C max
between the 2 regimens if the t rue difference between dexlansoprazole C maxcentral values from 2 regimens is no more 
than 5%. The power for concluding equivalence on dexlansoprazole AUC between 2 regimens would be over 95%. 
This sample size was based on the intrasubject variance of 0.08 84 for log(C max) and 0.0365 for log(AUC) from Part 1 
(30 mg) of the TAK -390MR -[ADDRESS_554459] variance of log(C max) was higher 
than in Part 2 (60 mg).

4.0 INTRODUCTION
Dexlansoprazole is a proton -pump inhibitor (PPI) with prolonged elevat ion of intragastric pH. 
PPIs inhibit the secretion of H+ions in the stomach by  [CONTACT_437611] (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme 
(proton pump) at the secretory  surface of the gastric parietal cell [1]. Dexl ansoprazol e is the 
R-enantio mer of the racemate lansoprazole. Lansoprazole, init ially approved in [LOCATION_009] in 1990, is 
currently marketed in over 90 countries and has a well -established safet y profile. 
[COMPANY_005] Development Center Americas, Inc. (TDC Americas) developed dexlansoprazole 
delayed -release capsules (al so referred to as dexlansoprazole modified -release capsules) as a new 
therapy  for treating acid -related di sorders inc luding symptomat ic non -erosive gastroesophageal  
reflux disease (GERD), erosive esophagi tis(EE), and maintenance of healed EE and relief o f 
heartburn. Dexlansoprazole capsules are approved for use in adults ( ≥18years of age) and 
adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) in over [ADDRESS_554467] approved for use in adults in the [LOCATION_002] (US) i n January  2009. The internat ional birth date (IBD) is [ADDRESS_554468] ive levels of drug over a l onger peri od of  time, resul ting in pro longed 
elevation of intragastri c pH. 
The pharmacokinet ic (PK), pharmacodynamic, efficacy, and safet y profiles of dexlansoprazole 
capsules fo llowing administrati on of  dexlansoprazol e 30, 60, and [ADDRESS_554469], and the maintenance of healed EE. Currently, dexlansoprazole granules (Granules -LL and 
Granules -H for 30 m g and Granules -LS and Granules -H for 60 mg) are manufactured and 
encapsulated into capsule product at [COMPANY_005] Pharmaceut ical Com pany, Ltd. (TPC) l ocated in 
Osaka, Japan.

Benefit/R isk Profile 4.2
The dose of dexlansoprazole administered in this study  is not anti cipated to induce any  potenti al 
risk or benefit to subjects participat ing in this study, as it is a single dose administered according to 
the dosing recommendations found in the full prescribing informat ion forDEXILANT
(dexlansoprazole) delayed -release capsules .
The safet y monitoring pract ices empl oyed by  [CONTACT_3181]  (ie, 12 -lead ECG, vital signs, clinical  
laboratory  tests, adverse events (AE)questioning, and physical examinat ion) are adequate to 
protect the subjects’ safety  and shoul d detect all expected treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs).
There will be no direct healt h benefit for study participants from receipt of study drug. An indirect 
healt h benefit to the healt hy sub jects enro lled in this study is the free medical tests received at

laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a drug, whether or 
not it is considered related to the drug.
An untoward finding gener ally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a preexist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnosti c procedure.
Requi re discontinuation or a change in dose of study medicatio n or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_4168].
Diagnoses v ersussigns and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG parameters maybe considered AEs if they are judged to 
be clinically  significant (i e, if som e act ion or intervent ion is required or if the investigator 
judges the change to be beyo nd the range of n ormal physi ologic fluctuati on). A l aboratory  
re-test and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value are not considered an intervention. In 
addition, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluat ion or m onitoring 
of an abnorm ality is not considered an intervention.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
A pre -exist ing condit ion (present at the time of signing of informed consent) is considered a 
concurrent medical history  condi tion and shoul d NOT be recorded as an AE. A baseline 
evaluat ion (eg, laboratory  test, ECG, X -ray, etc) sho uld NOT be recorded as an AE unless

of such a concurrent medical history  condi tion, the worsening or complication should be 
recorded appropriately as an AE (worse ning or complicat ion occurs after informed consent is 
signed). Invest igators should ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the 
condi tion (eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]), a ny occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_55723], serious, or 
severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change from Baseline in the condit ion (eg “worsenin g of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion should only be captured as an AE if occurring to a greater extent to 
that which would be expected. Again, investigators should e nsure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of an AE aft er the first administration of 
study  medicat ion or after any  change in study  medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion 
shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs:
If the subject experiences a change in the severit y of an AE that is not associated with a change 
in study  medicati on, the event shoul d be captured once with the maximum severit y recorded.
Preplanned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed 
early (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the worsening o f 
the condi tion shoul d be captured appropriately  as an AE. C omplicati ons resul ting fro m any 
planned surgery  should be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as AEs but should be documented in the subject’s source documents. 
Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.

An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of investigational 
drug, to or by  a study  subject, at a dose ab ove that which is assigned to that individual subject 
according to the study protocol. It is up to the investigator or the reporting physician to decide

Severe: An adverse event that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significant ly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention .
10.2.2 Assigning Causali ty of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing 
categori es:
Related: An AE that fo llows a reasonable temporal sequence fro m administration of a 
drug (including the course after withdrawal o f the drug), or for whi ch a causal  
relationship is at least a reasonable possibilit y, ie, the relati onship cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, 
complicat ions, conco mitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be 
respon sible.
Not Rel ated: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence fro m ad ministration 
of a drug and/or that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as 
underlying diseases, complicat ions, conco mitant medicat ionsand concurrent 
treatm ents.

10.2.5 Pattern of Adverse Event ( Frequency )
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c AEs (eg, headache) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive days are 
intermi ttent. All other events are continuous.
10.2.6 Action Taken With Study Treatment
Drug withdrawn –a study  medicat ion is stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  medicat ion.
Unknown –only to be u sed if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not applicable –a study  medicat ion was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE 
eg,the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study  medicat ion had not y et
started or dosing wit h study  medicat ion was already  stopped before the onset of the AE.
Dose reduced –the dose was reduced due to the particular AE.
Dose increased –the dose was increased due to the particular AE.
Drug interrupted –the dose was interru pted due to the particular AE.
10.2.7 Outcome 
Recovered/reso lved –subject returned to first assessment status wi th respect to the AE .
Recovering/resolving –the intensit y is lowered by  [CONTACT_45332] m ore stages: the diagnosis has or 
signs/symptom s havealmost disappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has 
not returned to the normal range or to the baseline value ; the subject died fro m a cause other 
than the particular AE with the condit ion rem aining “recovering/resolving .”
Not recovered/no t resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, signs/symptoms or laboratory  value on the l ast day  of the observed 
study peri od has beco meworse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital ano maly; the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE state remaining “Not recovered/not 
resolved .”
Recovered/ Reso lved wit h sequelae –the subject recovered from an acute AE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardi ovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis ).
Fatal  –an AE that is considered as the cause of death.
Unknown –the course of the AE cannot be fo llowed up due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_437598]’s participation in the study.

safeguard against longer-than-expected shippi [INVESTIGATOR_45294]. Use newspaper or other 
material to insulate the double-bagged samples from direct contact [CONTACT_45355]. Place the 
sample bundles into a polystyrene plastic (eg, Styrofoam) container (or other suitable 
container) and fill the excess space with dry ice slabs or ice pellets (preferably the latter). Make 
a note of the estimated weight of the dry ice used per shippi[INVESTIGATOR_7788].
9. Place the inventory paperwork (in a large self-sealing bag) on top of the dry ice in the 
polystyrene plastic container. Place the lid on the polystyrene plastic container and seal 
completely with strappi[INVESTIGATOR_45295]. Place the polystyrene plastic container in a cardboard shippi[INVESTIGATOR_437601].

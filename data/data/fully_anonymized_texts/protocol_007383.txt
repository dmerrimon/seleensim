Abstract  
The long head of the biceps can be a source of anterior shoulder pain that is primarily 
due to inflammation or instability of the long head of the biceps (LHB) tendon . 
Patients that fail non -operative management become candidates for biceps tenotomy 
and tenodesis. Currently, there is no universal protocol or gold standard for how the 
LHB tendon is tensioned. At our institution, the LHB is tensioned based on individual 
surgeon feel for the correct tensioning. The purpose of this study is to conduct a 
randomized, single -blinded prospective study comparing patients of the current 
regimen of bicep tensioning vs. utilizing a standardi zed method of anatomically 
tensioning the LHB tendon . The primary aim of assessing change in the American 
Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon ( ASES ) score s from baseline to post -surgery between 
the control and intervention groups will be assessed using a student’s t-test. In 
addition, longitudinal mixed effects models will be used to estimate changes in ASES 
scores, over all time -points using a random effect for surgeon.  Other relevant patient 
characteristics such as age, sex, and Charlson score will be included to  explore the 
adjusted relationship of the intervention and outcomes over time. A secondary aim of 
this study is to collect specific  measurements of the myotendinous junction of the 
LHB tendon to potentially establish if any characteristics predispose pati ents to 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_554995].  
 
I. Background and Significance/Preliminary Studies  
Pathology involving the long head of the biceps (LHB) tendon is an established 
source of upper extremity pain. Biceps tendon pathology is often associated wit h 
other primary shoulder pathologies including subacromial impi[INVESTIGATOR_20804], rotator cuff 
tears, or stenosis of the bicipi[INVESTIGATOR_554996]. The histological findings of the extra -
articular portion of the LHB tendon indicate that it undergoes a chronic , degenerative 
process much like other tendinopathies of the body, such as de Quervain’s 
tenosynovitis of the wrist.  
 
Management of bicipi[INVESTIGATOR_554997], such as tendonitis, is generally treated with 
conservative measures first, which consists of activity modification, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroid injections. If the patient fails these 
modalities of treatment, then surgical intervention is considered [7]. There are 
multiple ways to perform the procedure and different techniques to perform the  
tenodesis. The procedure involves performing a tenotomy (cutting) the LHB at the 
junction between the tendon and the supraglenoid tubercle  (origin of the biceps 
tendon) . Tenodesis  (or re -attachment of the tendon at a different site)  is performed at 
some l ocation within the intertubercular groove , but outside of the shoulder joint,  
using one of many forms of fixation either with an open or an arthroscopic approach. 
Post-operatively, some patients report persistent shoulder pain, biceps muscle  fatigue, 
and b icipi[INVESTIGATOR_554998]. Scores on the American Shoulder & Elbow Surgeons 
(ASES), a functional validated scale, are often used to measure these outcomes.  
 
Clinically, it may be important to consider the site of tenodesis in order to restore 
tension simi lar to that of normal physiological function. To date, there is no gold 
standard for the site and level of tenodesis [1, 3, 4, 6]. The current method for fixation 
(tenodesis) of the LHB tendon after tenotomy is based on surgeon feel for appropriate 
tension ing within the bicipi[INVESTIGATOR_554996]. We hypothesize that anatomic tensioning of 
the LHB during tenodesis will provide improved patient outcomes in the form of 
reducing anterior shoulder pain, bicipi[INVESTIGATOR_554999], bicipi[INVESTIGATOR_554998], and 
ASES scores.  
 
Additionally, there are no current population studies on the anatomy of  the LHB 
tendon and myotendinous junction. Specifically, detail regarding the myotendinous 
junction transition al zone has not been described [2, 4, 5], nor whether certain 
anatomical as pects of LHB tendon and myotendinous junction affect the rate of 
pathology of the LHB. This research project serves as a means to discover if these 
anatomical differences have clinical significance by [CONTACT_555010].  
 
II. Study Aims  
The main purpose of this study is to determine the clinical impact of restoring the 
anatomic -tension relationship of the long head of the biceps (LHB) when performing 
a biceps tenotomy and tenodesis. Specifically, we will investigate whether anatomic 
tensi oning  will improve functional outcome scores and decrease postoperative 
complications. We hypothesize that through a standardized method of anatomically 
tensioning the LHB tendon during tenodesis, patient outcomes will improve.  
 
Another purpose of this stu dy is to provide further information referencing the 
longitudinal anatomy of the LHB, specifically at the myotendinous junction transition 
zone. There are multiple measurements that are unique to each individual. The 
measurements that we will analyze are t he length from the supraglenoid tubercle to 
both the proximal and distal extents of the myotendinous junction. From these two 
measurements, we can calculate the total length of the myotendinous junction from 
beginning of muscle fibers to the end of tendino us fibers. We will also measure the 
width and circumference of the myotendinous junction.  
 
To date, these particular measurements have never been done before in an in vivo 
fashion. Our hope is that this analysis of the LHB myotendinous junction will identi fy 
any relationships with pathology at the LHB tendon.  
 
III. Administrative Organization  
a. The following sites will be utilized  for this study : Loyola Center for Health at 
Burr Ridge, Loyola Center for Health at Oakbrook Terrace,  Loyola Outpatient 
Center in Mayw ood 
i. These locations will be where [CONTACT_512125] and Garbis will have their initial 
clinical encounter with these patients. During these encounters, they will 
be approached about the research project if they are eligible based on 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
b. The surgical encounters will occur  at Loyola Ambulatory Surgery Center in 
Maywood, Russo Operating Center at Loyola Main campus, and Gottlieb 
Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555000]. Study Design  
a. Experimental Design : Patients that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
eligible for participation in the study. The design will be a single blinded format 
where the surgeon will be aware of what treatment the patient will receive 
(Control vs.  Intervention). The patient will not be informed of what arm of 
treatment they were s elected for. Block randomization will be utilized to place an 
equal number of patients into both groups.  
b. Study Population : Patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery with long 
head of the biceps tendon pathology.  
c. Sample size determination and power  analyses:  
Based on previous studies, it is assumed that the pre -ASES score for all patients 
undergoing biceps tenodesis is approximately 45.  At  [ADDRESS_728698] of care group will increase to 85 (Mean difference = 40, STD=18).  It is 
hypothesized that the treatment group with anatomical fixation will increase to 
approximately 93 (Mean difference = 48, STD=18).  
 
The necessary sample size  was calculated using 80% power of rejecting the null 
hypothesis (that there is no difference in change in ASES scores between the two 
groups of interest), when the population mean difference in ASES is ∆1 - ∆2 = 48 
- 40 = 8, with a standard deviation of 1 8, and with a significance level (alpha) of 
0.05.  This power and sample size calculation was computed using a two -sided 
two-sample equal -variance t -test. 
 
To achieve this power, at least 81 patients will need to be enrolled in each group.  
Patients will o nly be randomized once to this study.  If a patient has a repeat 
surgery, that case will not be eligible for randomization.  
 
d. Study outcomes/endpoints  
i. Study endpoint will be decided based on the power analysis that was 
calculated by [CONTACT_555011].

profession, BMI  
2. Clinical Factors : Indication for surgery, procedures performed, 
past medical history of upper extremity pathology  
3. Medical History : Myocardial inf arction, congestive heart failure, 
peripheral vascular disease, transient ischemic attack or 
cerebrovascular accident, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, connective tissue disease, peptic ulcer disease, liver 
disease, diabetes, hemiplegia, ch ronic kidney disease, solid tumor, 
leukemia, lymphoma  
4. Measurements: (in mm)

shoulder surgery  
b. Operations that occur at Loyola University Medical Center 
(Maywood, IL), Loyola Ambulatory Surgery Center 
(Maywood, IL), or Gottlieb Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
2. Exclusion criteria:  
a. Previous shoulder surgery involving the long head of the 
biceps tendon  
b. Younger than [ADDRESS_728699] is performed prior to surgery. If 
positive, the surgery will be cancelled and the 
patient will be excluded from the research study.  
ii. Recruitment procedures  
1. Where will recruitment occur?  
a. During the patient’s initial clinical visit, qualifying patients 
will be identified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Garbis or [CONTACT_512125] an d will be 
approached for voluntary study participation. At that time, 
they will be given a written document for informed 
consent. The clinician will go over the consent and the 
patient will have the opportunity to ask any questions. If 
they agree to be in the study, then informed consent will be 
obtained then. If they wish to read over the consent further 
and make a decision later, then they will be approached on 
the day of surgery by a member of the research team. If 
they decide against the research study,  then they will 
continue to receive the standard of care as per usual.  
b. If the patient wished to read the informed consent further at 
the clinical visit prior to making a decision, then they will 
be approached on the day of surgery by a member of the 
resear ch. Once again, the entirety of the research project 
will be explained to the patient. If they wish to proceed, 
then written consent will be obtained. If they decide NOT 
to participate in the study, then they will continue on to 
surgery and receive the sta ndard of care.  
 
2. Who will obtain consent?  
a. If obtained at the initial clinical visit, then it will be 
obtained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Garbis or [CONTACT_512125].  
b. If obtained on day of surgery, then a member of the 
research team will obtain the written consent.  
3. What recruitment m aterials will be provided to the potential 
participant (brochures/information sheets/video presentation)?  
a. At the patient’s initial clinical visit, they will be given a 
copy of the informed consent that details specifics of the 
research study that we are co nducting . It will be translated 
into a health comprehension level deemed appropriate by 
[CONTACT_187602]  (7th grade).  
iii. Screening procedures  
1. What procedures are required for screening?  
a. At the initial outpatient office visit, qualifying patients will 
be fur ther screened using the aforementioned 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. At that time, [CONTACT_555031] or [CONTACT_555032] will speak with the patient about the research study 
to its entirety, which will include the potential benefits, 
risks and alternatives.  
2. What is th e screening schedule (number of visits, length of visits)?  
a. Patient will be screened during their initial outpatient office 
visit.  
b. Those patients that express interest will again be 
approached on the day of surgery. On this day, a member 
of the research te am will explain to the patient, for the 
second time, the research project.  
3. Which screening tests/procedures are part of standard care and 
which are for research purposes only?  
a. A member of the research team will be at the office visit to 
obtain an ASES scor e prior to surgery and will contact 
[CONTACT_555012] [ADDRESS_728700] of Care : Aspects of the physical examination 
including range of motion, strength, neurovascular status, 
and shoulder/el bow specific testing will be recorded by [CONTACT_555013].  
i. A member of the research team will gather this 
information via chart review.  
c. Research Specific : On the day of surgery, a member of the 
research team will ask the patient a short series of questions 
in order to calculate an American Shoulder & Elbow 
Surgeon (ASES) score as their preoperative score. The 
member of the research team administering the 
questionnaire will not be blinded. A specific description of 
the ASES questionnaire is detailed later in the protocol. 
This questionnaire will again be tested at the patient’s 6 
month follow up.  
4. What happens with screen failures (including any data gathered  
during screening)?  
a. Those patients that are not eligible based on the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, will not be included in the 
study.  
b. The risk of patients incorrectly being included in the study 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_555001]/exclusion criteria is 
essent ially zero.  
i. All female patients are screened day of surgery with 
a pregnancy test.  
ii. Age of patient is obtained & confirmed at all 
clinical encounters.  
iii. History of prior surgery is obtained and verified at 
initial clinical visit.  
b. Randomization procedures  
i. Surgeon block randomization scheme will be used. This will be [ADDRESS_728701] provided by 
[CONTACT_555014]. Both surgeon schedules are 
accommodating of this because they are in the operating room on different 
days of the week.  
iii. Prior to the start of the surgery, the surgeon will be notified by a member 
of the research t eam if the patient will be part of the control group or the 
anatomic fixation group.  
c. Study Intervention  
i. Control Group : The control group patient will undergo biceps tenotomy 
and tenodesis based on surgeon feel on appropriate tensioning of the 
tendon (Curre nt practice).  
1. Of note, there is no universal method or gold standard on how the 
long head of the biceps should be tensioned during bicep tenodesis.  
ii. Intervention Group : Patients that are randomized to the intervention group 
will undergo biceps tenodesis in a standardized, step -by-step protocol as 
outlined below  
d. Surgical Procedure Overview  
i. The initial indication for tenodesis is at the surgeon’s discretion, but after 
that decision is made, then the Control vs. intervention is determined 
based on our randomiza tion scheme.  
ii. Per current surgeon protocol, a ll patients will receive a single injected pre -
operative nerve block and standard post -operative pain regimen .  
iii. As with every shoulder arthroscopy, a diagnostic scope of the shoulder 
will be performed, which will  include evaluation of the intra -articular 
portion of the long head of the biceps tendon. If there is any instability or 
tendinopathy, then the surgeon will decide if biceps tenotomy and 
tenodesis is indicated.  
iv. Surgical Steps : Biceps Tenotomy & Tenodesis  
*Bolded steps are deviation from current, standard surgeon protocol  
1. Positioning of the patient will be in the standard beach chair 
position  
2. During the diagnostic arthroscopic shoulder scope, the long head 
of the biceps is inspected for any instability or tendinopathy, which 
would be an indication to perform tenotomy at the junction of the 
supraglenoid tubercle with arthroscopic scissors  
a. If Control group: Bicep tenotomy will occur now  
3. The patient will undergo all other indicated arthroscopic portions 
of the  case (i.e. rotator cuff repair, subacromial decompression, 
rotator interval release, etc. ) 
4. At the conclusion of the arthroscopic portion of the case, the 
patient’s arm will be placed with the elbow at 90 degrees of flexion 
and neutral forearm rotation. The trochar in the anterior shoulder 
portal and the arthroscope in the posterior shoulder portal will be 
left in the glenohumeral joint  momentarily . The arthroscopic 
light will be shut off temporarily. Both will be secured to the 
shoulder using sterile ioban  to maintain a good water seal & 
ensure that both are kept in the correct  position for tenotomy 
later  
5. The standard mini -open subpectoral approach will be made along 
the anterior axillary fold  
6. Full thickness skin flaps are developed down to muscular fascia  
7. The biceps fascia is opened and the pectoralis major tendon is 
retracted superiorly  
8. The myotendinous junction of the long head of the biceps tendon 
and its location within the intertubercular groove will be marked 
using electrocautery  
9. The surgeon will then  turn back to the glenohumeral joint, 
remove the ioban, turn the arthroscope back on, then perform 
the biceps tenotomy. All instrumentation will be removed from 
the glenohumeral joint at this time  
10. The surgeon will then turn to the mini -open subpectoral inc ision 
that was previously made and the long head of the biceps tendon 
will be retrieved  
11. A ruler will be used to measure the entire length of the long 
head of biceps tendon from origin to end of tendon fibers, 
origin to beginning of tendon fibers, and width  of the tendon  
12. The arthroscopy camera will be used to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_555002] a ruler for 
scale  
a. Per standard protocol, these arthroscopic pi[INVESTIGATOR_555003]. This dat a will 
be retrospectively collected by a member of the research 
team.  
13. The tendon is tagged with a running, locking number [ADDRESS_728702]. Garbis’ notes (Complications, Range of motion, 
strength, special shoulder or elbow physical exam tests).  
2. Once the patient has completed their 6 month follow up 
appointment, all identifiable data from that patient will be deleted 
from all research records.  
ii. Description of American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score (ASES)  
The ASES form was created by [CONTACT_555015] 
a physician -rated and pa tient rated section. The total maximum score (and 
best outcome) is 100. Half of the score is weighted for pain and the other 
half for function. The final pain score is calculated by [CONTACT_555016] 10 and multiplying by 5. For the functional 
portion, each of the 10 separate questions are on a scale from 0 to 3. The 
functional portion total is then multiplied by 5/3 to make it a total of 50 
points. In summary, 50 points come from the visual analog scale and the 
other 50 come from the  functional portion, which equals a possible total of 
100.

VI. Safety Monitoring Plan  
a. Definition of adverse events, serious adverse events  
i. All surgical interventions are accompanied by a risk of blood loss, 
infection, and damage to surrounding structures.  Patients will be advised 
that post -op pain and stiffness is expected and normal.  If this surgery is 
not successful, there may be need for additional surgeries. If the patient 
undergoes rotator cuff repair in addition to biceps tenotomy and tenodesis, 
there are risks that the rotator cuff repairs may fail to heal or even retear. 
Sympto matic retears may require further operative intervention. Scar 
tissue accumulation may also require further operations. All of these risks 
are routine risks associated with arthroscopic biceps tenotomy and 

tenodesis with or without rotator cuff repair. The only known possible risk 
specific to this research study will be an additional [ADDRESS_728704] protected Loyola R: drive, then will be de -identified prior to 
data analysis.  
 
b. What procedures will be used to monitor subject safety?   
i. As with all patient interactions, safety will be prioritized by [CONTACT_555017]. Our research project does not incur any 
increased safety concerns. However, due to the nature of research, 
participants in our study will inherently receive more attention because of 
increased interactions with members of the research team. If any concerns, 
suggestions, or questions arise during our research project, they will 
immediately be brought to the attention of the principal investigators of 
the study.  
c. Who (list names) will ident ify, document, and report adverse events?  
i. Adverse event identification will be the responsibility of each member of 
the research team, specifically, [CONTACT_555033] and [CONTACT_555034]. 
These events will be reported promptly to the IRB office.  
d. What ar e the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284706]?  
i. All patients involved in the study will be allowed to withdraw at any time. 
Consent may be revoked at any time prior to completion of the study, 
which is expected to be a duration of one year. All me mbers of the 
research team will be held responsible for notifying the sponsors of the 
study ([CONTACT_512125] & [CONTACT_555031])  if patient safety is compromised.  
VII. Plan for patient identifiers and information  
a. Plan to protect patient identifiers for improper use and d isclosure  
i. All patient health information (PHI), demographics and sensitive data will 
be kept on the Loyola provided secure server in an assigned password 
protected folder located on the R: drive. All paper records, if any, will be 
kept in a locked cabinet in the offices of the principal investigator.  
b. Removal of patient identifiers and record retention  
i. Upon completion of the study, electronically stored patient identifiers will 
be deleted from the R: drive and any paper records will be disposed of 
using Loyo la Medical Center approved shred bins for such purpose.  
c. Individuals with access to protected health information  
i. Only research team members listed on the protocol will be granted access.  
d. Summary of the use of the data  
i. Data will be collected in a prospective  manner, statistically analyzed and 
formatted for presentation at regional or national surgical meetings and/or 
publication in peer reviewed surgical/medical journals.  
 
VIII.  Statistical Analysis Plan  
The primary aim of assessing change in the ASES score from baseline to po st-surgery 
between the control and intervention groups will be assessed using a student’s t -test, 
as indicated in the study design.  
 
In addition, longitudinal mixed effects models will be used to estimate changes in 
ASES scores, over all time -points using a random effect for surgeon.  Other relevant 
patient characteristics such as age, sex, and Charlson score will be included to explore  
the adjusted relationship of the intervention and outcomes over time.

1. Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?  
We are asking you to take part in this research study because y ou are having an arthroscopic 
shoulder surgery (using a scope with a camera to see the inside of your shoulder).   
 
2. Why is this research being done?  
 
There are two reasons for why this research is being done. The first reason is to better 
study the anatomy  of a tendon that we will encounter during your surgery. The second 
reason is to help develop a better step -by-step process of performing a specific portion of 
your surgery. We want to develop a more thorough surgical routine to potentially help 
patients a fter surgery so that they have less pain and weakness.  
 
3. What will happen to me during the study?  
You will undergo shoulder surgery like normal. During your surgery, we will take pi[INVESTIGATOR_555007]. In addition, you will be randomly selected (50/50 
chance) to have your surgery done in a more detailed, step -by-step process.  Neither you nor 
your doctor will be able to choose your treatment.  You will not be told which treatment you 
had. 
 
4. How long will I participate?  
Your parti cipation in this study will last one year following your surgical procedure . You 
will be asked to complete your normal clinical visits after surgery. These clinic visits are the 
standard for any patient that undergoes this procedure and are not unique to t his research 
project.  The only additional time required in participating in this study is that you will 
receive a phone call and be asked a series of 17 questions These phone calls will occur prior 
to surgery, at your 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 mon ths and one year  by a member of 
the research team, which should take less than two minutes of your time.  
 
5. Will I benefit from the study?  
We do not know if you will benefit from participating in this study.  For more information, 
please see Benefit section below.   
 
6. What are the  risks?  
If you are selected to be in the intervention group of this study, you will be under anesthesia 
for approximately [ADDRESS_728705] other options besides taking part in this study?  
Participation in research is completely voluntary. If you choose to not participate,  you will 
receive your doctor's usual t reatment for your problem.  
 
8. Will I be paid to participate?  
You will not receive any payment for taking part in this study.  
 
9. Will it cost me anything to participate?  
There is no cost to you for taking part in this study.  
 
End of Overview and Key Informatio n 
 
Please review the rest of this document for details about these topi[INVESTIGATOR_555008] a decision about whether to participate in this research.   
 
 
PURPOSE OF RESEARCH:   You are being asked to participate in this study because you are 
having arthroscopic shoulder surgery (a scope with a camera to look inside your shoulder joint)  
 
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a more thorough, step -by-step process to  
perform a portion of your surgery will result in decreased complications after surgery. In 
addition, we are studying a specific portion of your biceps tendon that has not been studied 
before.  
 
The study is being conducted [CONTACT_555033] and [CONTACT_555034] .  
 
Approximately 164 people will participate in this research.   
 
DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION OF PROCEDURES:   If you agree to participate in 
this study,  you will be asked to do the following things:   
 
All participants in the study will have pi[INVESTIGATOR_555009] a shoulder scope. Those images will be securely stored in the electronic health record, then 
studied by a member of the research team.  
 
You will be assigned by [CONTACT_555018] 1 or group 2.   
 
Group 1 : The control group. This is the group that will have no change to the surgical 
procedure. This surgery would be the same as someone who did not participate in the 
study. You would still have biceps tenotomy (cutting of the bice ps tendon) and tenodesis 
(the tendon is fixed at a different location on the bone). When placing the tendon at a 
different location on the bone, the surgeon will go by [CONTACT_555019].  
OR 
Group 2: The intervention group. This group will have a standardized, step by [CONTACT_555020] a portion of your surgery. The specific portion that will be affected is 
called biceps tenotomy and tenodesis. What this means is that the biceps will be cut 
(tenotomy), then we will place the tendon at a different location on the bone (tenodesis).  
When placing the tendon at a different location on the bone, the surgeon will use 
markings on the tendon and bone to make sure that the tendon is put back in its 
natural/anatomical location.  If chosen to be in this group, then your surgery will be 
lengthened by [CONTACT_2902] [ADDRESS_728706] (such as better treatments or the side effects of 
the treatments), your doctor will discuss this new information wit h you and will help you make a 
decision about your continuing in the research.  
 
RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:  The surgical procedure you are assigned to receive may not be as 
effective or may be associated with more problems than the other surgical procedure in this  study 
that you did not receive.  
 
While participating in this study, you may experience the following risks, side effect and/or 
discomforts:   
 
As per all surgical interventions, there is a risk of blood loss, infection, and damage to 
surrounding structure s. Post -op pain and stiffness is expected and normal. If this surgery is not 
successful, there may be need for additional surgeries. If you undergo a rotator cuff repair in 
addition to biceps tenotomy and tenodesis, there are risks that the rotator cuff re pairs may fail to 
heal or even re -tear. Symptomatic re -tears may require further operative intervention. Scar tissue 
accumulation may also require further operations. All of these risks are routine risks associated 
with arthroscopic biceps tenotomy and ten odesis with or without rotator cuff repair.  
 
There may be other side effects that we cannot predict or are currently unknown.  
 
BENEFITS:  We do not know if you will benefit from participating in this study.   The 
information we learn may help others.  
 
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS:   You do not have to participate in this research project to 
receive care and treatment at Loyola University Medical Center.  
 
Your doctor has discussed other options with you along with their risks and benef its. 
 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION:   Taking part in this study may or may not cost your insurance 
company more than the cost of getting treatment without being in this study.   Some health plan  
insurer s will not pay the costs for people taking part in st udies. Check with your health plan  
insurer  to find out what they will pay for. Depending on your health insurance  coverage , there 
may be out-of-pocket costs for you like co -payment of the standard visits, co -insurance, or 
deductibles. You will be responsib le for these expenses.   
 
RESEARCH RELATED INJURY:  
In the event that you are injured or have side effects as a result of participating in this research 
project, your doctor will take the necessary steps to treat the problem.  There are no funds 
available f rom Loyola University Medical Center, Gottlieb Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Loyola 
University Health System or Loyola University of Chicago  to pay for the cost of care of the 
problem. You will be financially responsible for the cost of care of any problems.   By [CONTACT_555021], you are not giving up any legal rights to seek to obtain compensation of injury.

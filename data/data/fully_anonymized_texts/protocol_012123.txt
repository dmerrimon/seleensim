MRI-based Prostate Radiotherapy Planning  
Protocol Version Date:  3/26/15  
 
4 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Overview  
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_112545]  15 men with adenocarcinoma of the prostate who are planned to 
undergo treatment with radiotherapy at DFCI/BWH.  For this study an MRI examination will be 
done at the time of radiation treatment planning.  In parallel to the routine CT -based plan, an  
MRI based -plan will be generated from which dose to pelvic organs will be calculated.  We will 
then compare the results between the CT - and MRI -based plans and evaluate in the setting of 
equivalent prostate coverage to what degree our normal tissue dose c onstraints are met. Based on 
the findings of this study , the feasibility of future studies involving MRI -based prostate 
radiotherapy plannin g will be d etermined, including  the use  of new  MRI  methods  for tumor 
imaging , such as diffusion weighted  imaging and  tumor hypoxia  imaging .  
 
1.[ADDRESS_125309] clinically loc alized disease, for which external beam radiotherapy is one of 
the principle treatment options. Men with low -risk prostate cancer are treated with prostate 
radiotherapy alone, while those with intermediate -risk or high -risk disease are generally receive 
hormonal therapy in addition to radiotherapy. Modern radiotherapy techniques allow high doses 
(>75 Gy) of radiation to be administered safely. Randomized controlled trials have shown that 
higher doses of radiotherapy result in superior long -term prostate can cer control for men with 
clinically localized disease. 1-2  The major acute toxicities of prostate radiotherapy are temporary 
bladder and bowel symptoms, such as urinary frequency or  obstruction and rectal urgency. 3 
Long -term side effects include erectile dysfunction and rectal bleeding. Both acute and long -term 
toxicity can be minimized by [CONTACT_112552], bladder, and penile bulb. 
Specifically, it has been shown that limiting the volume of the anterior rectal wall that receives 
70 Gy or more to less than 10 cubic centimeters, decreases the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_112546] .1 
 
1.3 Rational  
 
Radiation treatment planning for prostate cancer routinely involves delineation of pelvic organs 
on a pre -treatment computed tomography (CT) scan followed by [CONTACT_112553] (prostate and seminal vesicles) and organs at risk (e.g. rectum and 
bladder). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a distinct advantage in delineation of the 
prostate and adjacent organs due to the known superior soft tissue image quality relative to CT. 
The improv ed anatomic resolution of soft tissue on MRI is particularly important at the prostatic 
apex where up to 40% of prostate cancer is present and where the juxtaposed neurovascular 
bundles, penile bulb and anterior rectal wall are within close proximity.  
 
Several studies have shown the CT -defined prostate to be larger than the MR -defined prostate by 
a mean ratio of 1.[ADDRESS_125310] at the prostatic rectal 
MRI-based Prostate Radiotherapy Planning  
Protocol Version Date:  3/26/[ADDRESS_125311] gains in consistency 
at the p osterior api[INVESTIGATOR_112547]. 7  An additional advantage to MRI is the abili ty to identify 
dominant lesions within the prostate as well as areas of extracapsular extension or neurovascular 
bundle involvement and ensure that they are encompassed by [CONTACT_112554].  
 
For the reasons outlined above, MRI -based treatment planning has been used in several high 
volume cancer centers for the treatment of prostate cancer. The process typi[INVESTIGATOR_112548] 1) obtain both CT and MRI images 2) outline soft tissues and bony structures on MRI 3) 
co-register CT and MRI images 4) transfer  of soft tissue outlines to CT image 5) calculate dose 
to outlined structures on CT image. These steps are necessary since dose calculations depend on 
electron density data obtained from the CT image.  
 
A downside of this approach is the potential to intro duce error during the image co -registration 
process , which is based largely on bony anatomy. At our institution radio -opaque gold fiducial 
markers are implanted in the prostate for use on daily imaging during treatment to reduce 
uncertainty associated with  patient setup and prostate motion between delivered fractions of 
radiation each day. These fiducials markers are placed after radiation therapy has been chosen as 
the appropriate treatment and prior to obtaining the planning CT. The routine management of 
patients receiving radiotherapy currently does not include MR imaging after fiducials are placed. 
We have determined that the fiducials are easily identified on both CT and MRI and can be used 
for image co -registration, obviating the need to rely on struct ures outside the prostate during 
image co -registration, thereby [CONTACT_112555] -regis tration of the CT and MRI image data sets.

5.0 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
5.1 Design/Study Type  
 
With this pi[INVESTIGATOR_112550] -based treatment planning combined 
with fiducial -based image co -registration (as described below ) could enhance the thera peutic 
ratio of prostate radiotherapy by [CONTACT_112556], neurovascular bundles, penile bulb , and bladder  
without compromising target coverage.  The study will not change  patient staging or treatment.  
The maximum total accrual will be 15 participants.  
MRI-based Prostate Radiotherapy Planning  
Protocol Version Date:  3/26/[ADDRESS_125318] workflow for patients preparing to undergoing prostate radiation therapy at 
BWH/DFCI involves placement of intraprostatic fiducial markers (i.e. three gold seeds) followed 
by a non -diagnostic planning CT scan, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [ADDRESS_125319]. MRI examination will be performed no earlier than 3 
days after fiducial placement. The MRI examination will be performed prior to starting 
radiotherapy. Ideally, the MRI examination will be performed within 1 week of (either before or 
after) the radiotherapy planning CT examination.  
 
Participants  will have one prostate MRI examination for this study that  will take approximately 
[ADDRESS_125320]’s comfort. A 
radio frequency receiver coil encased in a plastic mold called a phased -array coil will be 
positioned around the subject’s pelvis . The imaging protocol will include fast spin echo (FSE) 
for T2WI and fast spoiled gradient ( FSPGR) for T1WI.  Following the MRI exam, the imaging 
data will be collected and archived. A s afety read will be performed  in a timely fashion  and the 
study PI [INVESTIGATOR_112551].  
 
5.[ADDRESS_125321] 
imaging is obtained . The target (i.e. the prostate gland and seminal vesicles) and normal tissues 
(i.e. bladder, rectum, and penile bulb) will be outlined independently on both CT and MR images 
by [CONTACT_112557].  The MRI will be co -registered with the standard planning CT scan by 
[CONTACT_112558]. MRI -based contours will be transferred to the CT scan 
and a mock radiotherapy plan will be generated from these contours. As is conventional for a 
standard CT -based plan, dose volume histogram (DVH) analyses will be done for each contoured 
structure. Using DVH data, MRI -based and CT -based plans will be normalized to produce 
MRI-based Prostate Radiotherapy Planning  
Protocol Version Date:  3/26/15  
 
9 equivalent target coverage. It will then be determined to what degree norma l tissue dose 
constraints are met.  
 
5.5 Publication Plan  
 
The end of the study is the time point at which data are sufficiently mature for analysis, as 
defined in the section on Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration. The results will be 
made public with in 12 months of reaching the end of the study. At that time a manuscript will be 
prepared for publication in a peer -reviewed journal.  
 
5.6 Compensation Plan  
 
Participants will not receive compensation for this study.  
 
 
5.7 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Study 
 
Participants will complete  MRI examination and will be included in the analysis as per protocol 
unless  one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Metastatic disease progression prior to MRI  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents MRI examination  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
 
• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with MRI 
examination  and/or documentation requirements  
 
• Participan t decide s to withdraw from the study  
 
• Gene ral or  specific changes in the participant's condition render the participan t 
unacceptable for MRI examination or ability to proceed with prostate radiation 
treatment planning  in the judgment of the treating investigator  
 
Participants  will be removed from the protocol when any of the se criteria apply.  The reason for 
removal from protocol, and the date the participan t was rem oved , will be documented in the 
medical record . 
 
5.[ADDRESS_125322] report to the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_102802] (SAE) that occurs at 
the time of MRI examination on the local institutional SAE form. Participating 
investigators will report to their local Risk Management office any  participant safety 
reports or sentinel events that require reporting according to institutional policy.

5.8.2 Anticipated Reactions  
Anxiety, claustrophobia, and other related symptoms may occur in some patients prior to 
or during MRI examination.  
 
5.8.3 Reaction  Management  
Participants will be asked about history of difficulty/ inability to tolerate MRI 
examination, panic attacks, claustrophobia, or other symptoms that would increase the 
likelihood of inability to tolerate an  MRI examination. A low dose of  lorazepam will be 
prescribed for patients who may benefit from mild sedation  during the examination . All 
participants will be encouraged to promptly report adverse  or unanticipated  reactions. 
They will be provided with contact [CONTACT_112559] e investigator and study 
nurse, as well as a [ADDRESS_125323] dose constraint metrics , specifically the rectal V70 (volume of the rectum receiving at 
least 70 Gy), penile bulb V70 an d V50, and bladder V80, V75, V70 and V65 will be calculated  
and compared between MRI -based and CT -based plans. The primary comparison is rectal V70, 
and analysis of other dose constraint metrics will use the same approach . There will be no 
adjustment for multiple testing given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_109248].  
 
The quantitative level (volume in cc)  of each metrics will be summarized as mean ( standard 
deviation, SD ) or median ( range). Change in levels from CT - to MRI -based plan  will be 
analyzed using the paired t -test (or Wilcoxon signed rank test, if appropriate).  Percent reduction  
from CT- to MRI -based plan  will be reported descriptively as  mean with two -sided 90% 
confidence interval (CI) . The proportion of participants who achieve reduction of  10% or more 
in each metrics will also be provided with the exact binomial  two-sided 90% CI.  
 
6.2 Sample Size, Accrual Rate  and Study Duration  
 
A total of 15 evaluable participants will be accrued within one year. With 15 subjects, t he 
estimated width of 90% CI on an observed mean percent decline of a dose constraint marker 
from CT to MRI  would  be +/ -8.5% and +/ -17%, assuming that the SD is 20% and 40% 
respectively. There is 80% power to detect an 0.68SD change corresponding to mean d ecline of 
14% and 27% using a one -sample paired t -test (two -sided alpha=0.10), assuming SD is 20% and 
40% respectively . The maximum width  from the exact binomial  90% CI for the proportion of 
participants  with reduction of 10% or more is 46% (+/ -23%).  
 
The study will terminate when all required imaging data from the  last participant is obtained . It is 
hoped that accrual targets will resemble the ethnic and racial composition of the U.S. population 
as closely as possible. Given the small sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], no pre -specified accrual 
targets by [CONTACT_112560].

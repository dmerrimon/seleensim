2.1 Primary Objective: ........................................................................................................................................ [ADDRESS_1226426] been well documented,3,4 and it is widely  accepted that a lack of exercise can increase an individual’s risk 
of recurrence or developi[INVESTIGATOR_877760]. Increasing attention is now being given to the role of lifestyle in cancer 
survivorship. There is a growing body of evidence for lifestyle interventions that aim to promote physical activity as having the potential to counter some of the adverse effects of cancer treatments, disease progression and other health outcomes.
5 Exercise performed 2 -3 times a week has been shown to improve physical fitness, functional performance, and 
quality of life in men with PCa;1,2,6-[ADDRESS_1226427] been used for the diagnosis 
and follow -up of PCa. PSA (prostate specific antigen) is the most common marker used, however, recently PSA 
screening has fallen un der controversy based on the high number of false positive diagnosis for PCa. Out of men that 
display elevated PSA levels in blood, only 25% are associated with PCa.

that is overexpressed in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_877761].
[ADDRESS_1226429] treatment based on its 94.5% specificity to PCa from other types of malignancy.17  Early prostate cancer 
antigen ( EPCA ) is a prostate cancer -associated nuclear structural protein displaying sensitivity and specificity for 
prostate cancer. In a recent study, EPCA was been found to be significantly elevated in localized PCa and strongly 
predicted cancer progression.18 Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA ) and its receptor ( uPAR ) have been connected 
with PCa stage and bone metastases.19 Preoperative plasma uPA was a strong predictor of biochemical recurrence.20 
Elevated levels of both preoperative uPA and uPAR were associated with aggressive biochemical recurrence including development of distant metastasis, suggesting an association with occult metastatic disease.
20 The uPA axis is 
involved in various  phases of tumor development and can be used as a biomarker to determine the effectiveness of 
exercise in modulating tumor progression.21 Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be quantified through microfiltration 
and as indicative of advanced prostate cancer and can be an alternative source for disease profiling and 
[ADDRESS_1226430] as circulating biopsy of the tumor.  
1.2 Biomarker f or Cancer -related Fatigue . Prostate cancer survivors commonly report having 1 or more cancer 
related symptom that impacts their quality of life. One common symptom associated with cancer, termed cancer -
related fatigue, is exceedingly common and treatable not only in prostate cancer patients but other cancers as 
well.23 Cancer -related fatigue is reported by 50- 90% of patients as a symptom of their cancer [4].[ADDRESS_1226431] for advancing the field with novel methods of assessing fatigue in this clinical population. Bioma rkers would provide an objective method to track a patient’s 
fatigue level during treatment, allowing clinicians to optimize treatment with respect to the patient’s fatigue level. In previous studies, our collaborators at Hyperion Biotechnology identified a salivary biomarker of physical fatigue, called the Fatigue Biomarker Index (FBI)
[ADDRESS_1226432] also identified a salivary biomarker candidate for chronic fatigue syndrome.27 Both of these 
salivary biomarkers are based on changes in levels of naturally occurring peptide fragments arising from the same family of salivary proteins, the salivary Proline –rich Proteins (PRPs). Others have also identified changes in the 
levels of similar salivary peptides in Sjogren’s syndrome, a disease associated with significant fatigue.
[ADDRESS_1226433] a fundamental physiological link between a person’s fatigue level and the composition of the ind ividual’s saliva. Investigating whether similar changes in saliva are associated with fatigue 
is justified.  
1.3 Survey measurements for quality of life. Quality of life  will be measured using the Short- Form -36 and the 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue surveys.  
Health-Related Qual ity of L ife (SF-36) is designed to assess the h ealth status of pati ents and has been used 
previously in this popula tion 29. The SF- 36 assess es eight co mponents of  qual ity of life (physic al functioning, 
role func tioning, bodily pain, g eneral hea lth, vitality, social func tioning, mental health, a nd emotional hea lth) 
that is evi dence g enerated with we ll-establi shed reliabil ity and validity to support it s use.  
 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue (FACIT -F) is a self-reporte d survey evaluating 
the im pact of fatigue in the patient populati on. The FACIT -F is a [ADDRESS_1226434] of a 
home-based exercise program that can improve prognosis, physical function and quality of life in men with PCa; 
the results of which have the potential to promote health res toration and wellness while reducing cancer 
[ADDRESS_1226435] of exercise on circulating concentrations of biomarkers reported  in the literature 
to be beneficial for the prognostication of prostate cancer and salivary biomarker for fatigue . 
 
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary Objective: To demonstrate the impact of a home based exercise program versus wait -list control 
to modulate  circulating prognostic biomarkers  PSA, PSMA, EPCA, uPA and uPAR  in men with prostate cancer 
under active surveillance .. 
 2.1.1 Hypothesis: The home based exercise program participants will have significantly lower 
concentrations of circulating biomarkers compared to their non- exercising counterparts.  
  
2.2 Secondary Objective : To determine the impact of a home based exercise program versus wait -list control 
to modulate a novel salivary biomarker for fatigue in men with prostate cancer under active surveill ance.  
 
 2.3 Other Objective: 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1226436] control in 
improving physical function (as measured by [CONTACT_941] 6 minute walk)  and body composition in men 
with prostate cancer under active surveillance.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypothesis: The exercise group will have significant improvements in the physical 
function measure and body composition compared to the wait -list control group 
 
 
 
  2.3.2 To demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a home based exercise  investigation . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypothesis: Based on the simplicity of this program, we believe that we will be able to 
achieve our desired  recruitment and retention needs to complete the objectives of this 
study.

7.4 Sample Processing  
7.4.1 Serum Processing  
Whole blood will be collected through the antecubital vein in the non-dominant arm into a red topped 
vacutainer with clot activator. After inverting 3 -5 times to ensure proper mixing, samples will be 
centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 15 minutes. Serum will be aliquot ed in .5 mL samples and stored in a -80C 
freezer until analysis.  
 
7.4.2 Saliva Processing 
Raw saliva samples (~4 ml) will be collected by [CONTACT_877770] 2mL tubes. Within [ADDRESS_1226446] completed the 12 -week and 24- week timepoints, respectively. 
The interim analysis at 12 -weeks will be for safety and efficacy of the intervention and will include a between 
group comparison of circ ulating biomarkers and a review of adverse events reported by [CONTACT_19288].  
Statistical analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS 19.0 software. A 2 group analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
will be used to compare changes in biomarkers, physical function, body composition, body density, and quality of life between the exercise group and the WLC. Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation will be used to measure associations between biomarkers in Aim 1 to body composition, body density, physical function and qual ity of 
life measured in aim 2. A value of p<0.[ADDRESS_1226447] procedures for effectiveness and efficiency. We will 
also assess feasibility by [CONTACT_877771]. 
 
 8.2 Study patient description  
We will assess the number of participants screened per month and the percentage of screen eligible participants 
that were randomized into the study. We will assess intervention adherence and participant retention. Adherence will be based on the participant ’s ability and willingness to perform the prescribed activities. Retention will be 
defined as percentage of assessments completed. The number of randomized patients will be summarized by [CONTACT_654], 
ethnicity . The number of patients either completing or permanently discontinuing the exercise routine and other 
interventions will be summarized using counts and percentages
. 
 
8.3 Clinical Trial Protocol deviations  
All the following deviations will be summarized on the all randomized patient population: • Inclusion or 
exclusion criteria not satisfied. • Deviations related to the interventional arm • NOTE: A one week 
window from the scheduled visit is allowed for all visit time periods.

A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) is required for all an indiv idual protocols conducted at CTRC. All 
protocols conducted at CTRC are covered under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_877762].    The CTRC Institutional DSMP global policies provide individual trials with:  
• institutional policies and procedures for institutional data safety and monitoring,  
• an institutional guide to follow, 
• monitoring of protocol accrual by [CONTACT_877772], 
• review of study forms and orders by [CONTACT_16666], 
• tools for monitoring safety event s, 
• monitoring of UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]’s by [CONTACT_744633], 
• determining level of risk (Priority of Audit Level Score – PALS) ,  
• oversight by [CONTACT_71333] (DSMC),  and  
• verification of protocol adherence via annual audit for all Investigator Initiated Studies by [CONTACT_877773].  
  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1226449] independent review and report any findings to the CTRC Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and the UTHSCSA IRB.  It is not anticipated that any safety issues will arise from this study because it is an low risk 
interventional exercise study.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1226450] also be reported immediately to the Director of Quality Assurance (DQA) who will promptly notify the DSMC .  
 
9.1.3 Assuring Complian ce with Protocol and Data Accuracy 
As with all studies conducted at CTRC, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_877763], data accuracy/integrity and responding to recommendations that emanate from monitoring activities. Self-audit of data 
will be performed by a member of a research team (i.e. Research Assistant) . Protocol compliance, data accuracy 
15 
 and reporting of events is further ensured by [CONTACT_865534], whose audit 
report is shared with the PI , the research team, and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_744641].  
  
9.1.4 Safety Definitions: 
 For this study, the following safety definitions will be applicable:  
 Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others Definition: Unanticipated problem i nvolving risk 
to subjects or others includes any incident, experience or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
A. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol- related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied (note: the unfounded classification of a serious adverse event as “anticipated ” constitutes serious non -compliance); 
B. definitely related or probably related to participation in the research; and  
C. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized 
 
All UPRISO’s will be reported following CTRC and UTHSCSA institutional guidelines.

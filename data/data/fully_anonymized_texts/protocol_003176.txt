The purpose of th is Statistical A nalysis Plan (SAP) is to provide detailed description s of the statistical 
methods, data derivations and data displays for study protocol RHB -105-02 “A Randomized Double 
Blind Active Comparator Controlled Phase III Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy  of RHB -105 
in the Treatment of Confirmed Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) Infection ”, Amendment 3  dated 22 Mar  
2018 for final analysis . The table of contents and templates for the Table, Figure, Listings ( TFL)s will 
be produced in a separate document.  
Any deviations from this SAP will be described and justified in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).  The 
preparation of this SAP has been based on International Conference on Harmonisation  (ICH) E9 
guidelines . 
The SAP is finalized and signed prior to any of the following: study unblinding  and database hard 
lock. For operational efficiency,  an earlier time is usually targeted. If needed, revisions to the approved 
SAP may be made prior to dat abase hard lock. Revisions will be version controlled.

Protocol Number:  RHB -105-02 Version: Final  2.0, Date: [ADDRESS_235685] been screened and found to be positive for H. pylori  
infection via 13C UBT and follow up upper endoscopy (cul ture, histology or urease test) . All subjects 
who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria and have positive  13C UBT will undergo upper endoscopy 
with three biopsies taken from each of the antrum and corpus of the stomach. One biopsy from both 
the corpus and antrum will be combined and tested for H. pylori  via a rapid urease test at the point of 
care. One biopsy from both the corpus and antrum will be combined and sent for H. pylori  testing at 
the central histology laboratory. One biopsy from both the corpus a nd antrum will be combined and 
sent to the central laboratory for H. pylori  culture with susceptibility testing assessing amoxicillin,  
clarithromyci n, metronidazole and rifabutin. Subject specific pretreatment culture susceptibility and 
resistance results will be provided to the investigator in those subjects who fail to eradicate H. pylori  
upon post treatment 13C UBT analysis. All other susceptibility data will remain blinded until  study 
completion. The active comparator arm is expected to demonstrate an approximate 70%  efficacy rate 
and RHB -105 is being investigated for superiority with an expected approximate 83% efficacy rate.  
The study will be conducted at up to 65 sites in the [LOCATION_002] of America  ([LOCATION_003] ). Once informed 
consent has been obtained and upon positive screening and enrollment into the study, eligible subjects 
will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 between active comparator arm (n=222 ) and the active 
investigational a rm (RHB -105) (n=222). Subjects will receive RHB -105 or active comparator (RHB -
105-LT) for [ADDRESS_235686] of care therapy if susceptibility results 
are not contributory or are unavailable. These subjects will also undergo repeat endoscopy to assess 
changes in susceptibility and resis tance. All information related to therapy including drugs, doses and 
duration administered will be collected, and subjects will be reassessed for eradication of H. pylori  28 
- 60 days following completion of therapy, ideally between 43 and 71 days after in itiation of therapy. 
Susceptibility data will only be provided for those subjects who fail to eradicate H. pylori . 
3.2 Randomization  and blinding  
Subjects will be assigned to treatment using permuted block randomization without additional 
stratification.

Protocol Number:  RHB -105-02 Version: Final  2.0, Date: [ADDRESS_235687] of subjects screened but  deemed ineligible will be maintained indicating reason(s) for exclusion.  
Treatment assignments will be based on a centralized computer -generated randomization scheme 
using permuted block randomiz ation without additional stratification.  
Each subject will have a randomization code assigned that corresponds to treatment assignment and a 
unique identifier for drug packaging purposes. Once a subject number and treatment have been 
assigned to a subject, the subject identification number cannot  be reused even if the subject 
discontinues the study early or withdraws prior to receiving any study medication. Subjects who 
discontinue from the study or who have previously participated in the study will not be permitted to 
re-enroll. Subjects may be r escreened if endoscopic results for H. pylori  are unavailable during the 
screening window. Subjects will be randomized to one of the following groups:

6 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
6.1 Full Analysis Set (FAS) / Safety population  
The FAS (based upon the intention -to-treat principle as described in ICH -E9) will consist of all 
subjects  who received  at least one dose of  randomized study treatment and will be identical with the 
safety population  (SAF) . In the FAS subje cts will be analyz ed as randomized, in the SAF subjects will 
be analyz ed as treated.  If after unblinding it is detected that at least one subject did not re ceive the 
randomized study treatment summaries specified for the FAS may also be repeated for the SAF.  
6.2 Modified Intent -to-treat (mITT)  population  
The mITT  population is a subset of the FAS and will consist of all subjects  who received  at least one 
dose of  randomized study treatment and undergo a 13C UBT test at Visit 5  (with the allowed exception 
for female women becoming pregnant outlined in Section 4.1). In the mITT population subjects will 
be analyzed as randomized.  
6.3 Per-Protocol population  (PP)  
The PP  population is a subset of the mITT and will consist of all subjects  who consume at least 75% 
of planned study treatment received , have no major protocol violations  leading to exclusion from the 
PP population as determined during the Population Classification meeting (see Section 6.5) and 
undergo a 13C UBT test at Visit 5  (with the allowed exception for female s becoming pregnant as 
outlined in Section 4.1). In the PP population subjects will be analyzed as randomized.  
6.4 PK Population (PKP)  
The PKP will include those subjects in t he FAS  that have demonstrable presence of any component of 
investigational drug at Visit 3.  
6.5 Protocol deviations/violations  and exclusions from analysis sets  
All violations and exclusions of subjects  from analysis sets will be identified at the Classification  
Meeting just prior to study unblinding , through clinical review input provided by [CONTACT_198087].  
Protocol deviations will be classified as major (key) or minor  (non-key) as outlined in Protocol 
Deviation Criteria Form Version 2.0, 08 December 2017 . According to the definition in this document 
a major (key) protocol deviation is any change, divergence or departure from th e study design or 
procedures  defined in the protocol that might significantly affect a subject's rights, safety or welfare  
or the completeness, accuracy and/or reliability of the study data. A major protocol  deviation in this 
sense does not necessarily lea d to exclusion from the PP population . Examples of major protocol

7.2 Handling of missing or incomplete data  
Imputation rules for missing or partial Adverse Event ( AE) start date  for the purpose of identifying 
treatment -emergent AE s (TEAE) are defined below . These imputed dates are only created for the 
purpose of identifying TEAE programmatically;  they will not be used in any data displays  
If only Day of AE start date is missing:  
If the AE start year and month are the same as that fo r the first dose date, then:  
 If the full (or partial) AE end date is NOT before the first dose date or AE end date is missing, 
then impute the AE start day as the day of first dose date; otherwise, impute the AE start day 
as 1. 
 Otherwise, impute the AE start day as 1.  
Compare the imputed AE start date with treatment exposure period to determine whether the AE is 
pre-treatment AE, TEAE or post -treatment AE.  
If Day and Month of AE start date are missing:

If AE start year  = first dose year, then:  
 If the full (or partial) AE end date is NOT before the first dose date or AE end date is missing, 
then impute the AE start Month and Day as the Month and Day of first dose date; otherwise, 
impute the AE start Month as January and the Day as 1.  
 Otherwise, i mpute the AE start Month as January and the D ay as 1. 
Compare the imputed AE start date with treatment exposure  period to determine whether the AE is 
pre-treatment AE, TEAE or post -treatment AE.  
If Year of AE start date is missing:  
If the year of AE start is missing or AE start date is completely missing then compare the full (or 
partial) AE end date to the first dose date. If the AE end date is before the first dose date then the AE 
should be considered as a pre -treatment AE. Otherwise, the AE will be cons idered as TEAE.   
Imputation rules for missing or partial medication start/stop dates  are defined below:  
Missing or partial medication start date:  
 If only D ay is missing, use the first day of the month.  
 If Day and Month are both missing  and Year is not miss ing, use the first day of the year.  
 If Day, Month and Year are all missing, use a date before the first dose date.  
Missing or partial medication stop date:  
 If only D ay is missing, use the last day of the month.  
 If Day and Month are both missing, use the last day of the year.  
 If Day, Month and year are all missing, assign ‘continuing’ status to stop date  
Date imputation will only be used for computational purposes , e.g., determination of  treatment -
emergent  status. Actua l date values as they appear in the original CRFs will be shown in the data 
listings.  
Non-date Values : 
There will be no imputation for missing data  for non -date values .

randomized treatment (i.e. last medication intake is prior to first dose of treatment date (exclusive)).  
A concomitant medication is defined as a medication with either  
 a recorded medication start date falling within the double -blind or SOC phase of the trial , or 
 a recorded medication start date prior to the first day of study medication during the 
randomized treatment period without any recorded medication stop date prior to the start of 
the randomized treatment period.  
Medications with incomplete start or stop date s will be considered concomitant medications if it is 
possible that they could have been concomitant medications.  
Concomitant medications will be coded with the World Health Organization (WHO) drug  dictionary 
(Enhanced – Format C, 03MAR201 5 or later versio n). Concomitant medications will be  summarized 
for each treatment group by [CONTACT_6977]  (ATC ) 3rd level  and preferred  name  [CONTACT_198110]  (not exclusive) : 
 concomitant medications given during the double -blind phase (ie concomitant medications 
with a start date before or during the double blind phase of the study) , and  
 concomitant medications (excluding prescribed standard of care (SOC) medications ) given 
during the SOC phase for subjects entering the SOC phase of the tri al (ie concomitant 
medications either ongoing on the first day of  SOC medication or with a start date on or 
after the first day of SOC medication).  
A data listing will be  included that shows all medications by [CONTACT_198092]. Prior 
medications  will be excluded from the summar ies but will be included in the listing.  
Prescribed SOC medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_61094] 3rd level and preferred name [CONTACT_198111].  The summary will be done by [CONTACT_198093] -blind phase and overall.

(%) will be calculated as  
100  x [(total  number  of capsules  dispensed ) – (total  number  of capsules  returned )]
[ADDRESS_235706] a resulting compliance of over 100%.  
Study drug compliance will be summarized by [CONTACT_198094] . They will 
also be summarized in categories “< =75% compliant” , “>75% – 90% compliant” , “>90% – 100% 
compliant”, and “> 100% compliant”  using frequency tables.  
Compliance with SOC treatment will not be considered.  
All exposure and compliance data will be provided in data listings.  
8.6 Efficacy  analys es 
All efficacy analyses will be conducted on the FAS  as primary analyses and repeated on the  mITT and 
PP populations as sensitivity analyses . 
8.6.1 Analysis of p rimary efficacy endpoint (s) 
The primary endpoint is this study is eradication of H. pylori  as confirmed via 13C UBT test results at 
the test of cure Visit 5 (Day 43 -71) or fecal antigen test . Subjects with negative test results will be 
considered treatment successes. Subjects who test positive for H. pylori  infection  will be considered 
treatmen t failures , those subjects with indeterminate, not assessable, or missing results from actual test 
of cure visits will undergo a repeat 13C UBT testing. Persistent indeterminate results and subjects 
without any 13C UBT test after baseline will be considere d as treatment failures  and will be included 
as additional (sub -)category in the pertaining summary tables . 
Subjects who have their test of cure visit  prior to [ADDRESS_235707] dose of study medication will

Hypotheses:  
Let p O denote the response rate under RHB -105 and p P denote the response rate under the active 
compar ator then the primary two -sided hypothesis to be tested is  
H0: pO - pP = 0  
vs the alternative  
H1: pO - pP ≠ [ADDRESS_235709] at the 5% level of significance ; in addition the e stimated treatment difference along 
with the corresponding 95% CI  will be presented.    
As s ensitivity analyses the analysis of the primary endpoint will be repeated in the mITT and PP 
populations (where those subjects lost to follow -up or not completing Visit 5 will be excluded from 
the analys is). Further, the following sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of imputation rules 
for subjects wh o did not provide a result of the 13C UBT test  at Visit 5 will be added in the FAS:  
1. Eradication rates by [CONTACT_198095] (mITT 
population), and the same eradication rates will be assumed for subjects with unobser ved 
(missing) data. For this purpose, multiple imputations will be used where for a subject 
with missing data the event of eradication/non -eradication will be randomly assigned 
according to a Bernoulli -distribution with rate as estimated from the subjects with 
observed data. The results of this multiple imputation will be combined over the iterations 
according to the method of Rubin (1987) to generate an estimator for the treatment 
difference with corresponding 95% CI and a p -value for the associated chi -square test.  
2. All active -controlled subjects with missing data will be assumed as treatment successes  
while all subjects treated with the investigational regimen will be assumed as  treatment 
failures . Thi s method is used only to give a lower  bound on the upper limit of the 
confidence interval for the difference in eradication rates because such a scenario would 
be unlikely to actually occur.  
3. All subjects  with missing data will be assumed as treatment successes.  
Sensitivity analyses   2. and 3 . will be conducted  in a similar manner to the primary analysis.

with less than [ADDRESS_235711] pooled site from the other regions.  
8.6.2 Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoint (s) 
Antibiotic Resistance and Susceptibility Subgroup Analyses  -  
The primary endpoint will be summarized within subgroups formed by [CONTACT_46917] H. pylori  
susceptibility and resistance to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole and rifabutin determined 
based upon samples obtained prior to initiating study treatmen t. 
Proportion of subjects with eradicat ion of  H. pylori will be tested between two treatment  groups  using 
the chi -square test at the 5% level of significance ; in addition estimated differences within  each 
subgroup along with 95% CIs will be presented.  
Assess the difference in antibiotic resistance : 
The difference in antibiotic resistance and susceptibility of H. pylori  after treatment with study drug 
in treatment failure subjects will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. No formal statistical tests will be  
performed for group comparison . 
8.6.3 Analysis of exploratory  endpoint (s) 
Upon study completion and unblinding of all subjects, CYP2C19 status (performed at  baseline) will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_2939]. CYP2C19 status is classified as ultra rapid  metabolizers, extensive 
metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers and poor metabolizers . A summary table of CYP2C19 status 
and H. pylori  infection eradication success will be presented, and a chi -square test will be performed 
to test if CYP2C19 status is associated with treatment success.  
Further subgroup analyse s of efficacy  will be done by [CONTACT_198097] . 
Definition of these measures will be provided after finalization of the double -blind study phase.    
Subjects who have a positive 13C UBT test at Visit [ADDRESS_235712] -of cure visit (Visit 8) . Eradicat ion rates for H. pylori  at V8 will be summarized

8.7.1 Adverse events  
A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, 
symptom, physical finding or disease, whether or not  believed to be related to the investigational 
product that arises after the first dose of study drug was administered  and not later than [ADDRESS_235714] abnormalities, should also be considered as TEAEs, ONLY 
if they result in any of the following:   
 Discontinuation of study drug  
 Require treatment or any other therapeutic intervention and/or  
 Require further diagnostic evaluation (excluding a repetition of the same procedure to confirm 
the abnormality)  
All events, TEAEs and Serious adverse events ( SAE)s, regardless of severity or causality, that occur 
between the time of first study drug administration  and within [ADDRESS_235715] dose of 
blinded study drug are to be documented on the adverse event case report form with indications of 
onset, duration, severity (mild, moderate, and severe), seriousness, relationship to study drug 
(unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, definite), remedial actions taken, and outcome.  
All SAEs occurring during the administration of standard of care (SOC) drug are to be documented as 
SAEs on serious adve rse event case report form (for SOC) with indications of onset, duration, severity 
(mild, moderate, and severe), relationship to SOC drug (unrelated, unlikely, possible, probably, 
definite), remedi al actions take n, and outcome. If the SAE is deemed to be related to any of the standard 
of care drugs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to report the event to the manufacturer of the 
related drug, through the manufacturer’s post -marketing surveillance system . Determination of 
eradication of H. Pylori  infection will be based on 13C UBT testing done between 43 and 71 days after 
initiation of blinded therapy. Due to this delay in time of 28 -60 days, any SAE s that occur during the 
SOC dosing period will NOT be considered related to the study treatment regimen of RHB -105 or 
active comparator . 
All Adverse events (AEs) will be classified by [CONTACT_198099] (SOC) and Preferred Term 
(PT) according to the  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 19.0 or higher . 
In summaries by [CONTACT_3592], adverse events will be sorted by [CONTACT_198100] . Events of the same frequency within clas sification level  are 
sorted alphabetically.  
AE summary tables will be presented for TEAEs only and will include the following:  
 All TEAEs  
 Related TEAEs (AE will be defined as related if causality is definite or probable or possible)

A serious adverse event (SAE) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:   
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening, NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to 
an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to 
an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it wer e more severe  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is considered medically significant . 
Separate data list ings and summaries will be presented for all SAEs and deaths.  
 Serious TEAEs  
 Serious related TEAEs  
Individual subject data listings will be provided for all deaths  and discontinuation of study 
medication due to TEA Es. 
8.7.3 Clinical laboratory evaluations  
Key laboratory data ( Chemistry  and hematology , see Table 2 Table 2 ) will be subjected to both a 
quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis where frequencies of normal, abnormal low, and 
abnormal high values will be computed. Additionally, abnormal results will be summarized with 
frequencies and percentages by [CONTACT_198103] l significance, panel, test,  treatment group, and time point .

9 CHANGES TO PLANNED A NALYSIS FROM STUDY 
PROTOCOL  
For the secondary endpoints the protocol states that “ The proportion of subjects with failure to 
eradicat e H. pylori  and the treatment effect (difference in the proportions) will be estimated 
within each subgroup along with 95% 2 -sided confidence intervals …” F or the primary 
endpoint the proportion of subjects with treatment success (eradication of H. pylori ) is 
evaluated, this proportion will now also be used for all  secondary endpoints  to ensure 
comparable results.

11 APPENDICES  
Appendix A - Definitions for Clinical and Laboratory Adverse Events  
  
All adverse events (clinical and laboratory) will be rated as follows:  
  
Severity (Clinical Events Only)  
  
 
Severity of clinical events are to be graded  as follows:  
 1 = Mild:  Event Is noticeable to the subject, does not interfere with the subject’s 
daily activities and usually does not require additional therapy or dose 
adjustment.  
 2 = Moderate:  Event may interfere with the subject’s daily activities and may require 
additional therapy  
 3 = Severe:  Event may severely limit the subject’s daily activities and typi[INVESTIGATOR_198081].  
  
 
Causal Relationship  
The investigators are to assess the causal relationship  of all AEs using the following five categories:  
Relationship  Causality  Description  
Not related to 
investigational 
agent  Unrelated  The AE is clearly not related to the investigational agent.  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational agent.

To investigate the primary efficacy outcome in relation to pharmacokinetic results three  sensitivity 
analyses will be performed:  
1. A sensitivity analyses performed in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) excluding patients from the 
active comparator group that have a measurable rifabutin concentration at Visit 3.  
2. A sensitivity analysis performed in the Pharmacokinetic (PK) population, defined as s ubjects 
in the FAS that have demonstrable presence of any component of investigational drug at 
Visit [ADDRESS_235721] a measurable 
rifabutin concentration at Visit 3 will be excluded from the analysis.  
 
2.2 Additional Analyses of Safety  
To investigate the comparability of tolerance and sa fety of RHB -105 over the different phenotypes 
according to CYP2C19 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_198082] -emergent adverse event s

Active Comparator - all-in-one' combination oral capsule containing [ADDRESS_235723] of cure Visit 5 (Day 43 -71) or fecal antigen test. Subjects with negative test 
results are considered as treatment successes (responder). Subjects who test positive for H. pylori infection are considered as treatment failures (non -
responder). Subjects with indeterminate, not assessa ble, or missing results from actual test of cure visits should undergo a repeat 13C UBT testing.  
Subjects with persistent indeterminate results and subjects without any 13C UBT test after baseline will be considered as treatment failures.  
95% CI for the p roportion of responder are based on Wilson’s method.

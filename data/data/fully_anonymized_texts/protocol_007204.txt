PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
A Phase 1b/2a, Multi -Center Open -Label Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Efficacy of Combination Treatment with MEDI0457 (INO -3112) and 
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Patients with Recurrent / Metastatic Human 
Papi[INVESTIGATOR_475051](s) and number of patients planned 
This will be a multi- center study with the participation of sites in the [LOCATION_002] of 
America.  Approximately eight  centers  will participate in the study.  Approximately

Study design  
This is a Phase 1b/2a, open- label, multi- center study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, 
anti-tumor  activity, and immunogenicity of MEDI0457 (also known as INO -3112)  in 
combination with durvalumab (also known as MEDI4736) .  Approximately 50 patients with 
human papi[INVESTIGATOR_475052] / metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer 
will be enrolled in this study.  Approximately three to 12 patients (Safety Analysis Run- in 
patients) will be enrolled and assessed for safety before additional patients are enrolled at a 
recommended dose and schedule for the combination.  Because this study is the first time 
MEDI0457 has been combined with durvalumab, the study will start with enrollment of a 
minimum of three patients who will receive four doses of MEDI0457 ( Limited Schedule ) in 
combination with durvalumab.  Only if the safety analysis of the initial patients who complete 
the 7 -week dose -limiting toxicity evaluation period, is deemed acceptable (i.e., none of the 
initial patients experience a dose -limiting toxicity), the vaccination schedule will switch from 
the limited four doses ( Limited Schedule ) to the Indefinite Schedule (also known as the 
Planned Dosing Schedule, i.e. vaccinations will continue until disease progression).  This  
Indefinite Schedule will be implemented for all subsequent patients following the S afety 
Analysis Run- in. Otherwise, if a third of the initial patients experience a dose -limiting 
toxicity, a minimum of three additional patients (i.e., a minimum total of six patients for the 
Safety Analysis Run- in) will be enrolled and the initial minimum six patients in the Safety 
Analysis Run- in cohort will be limited to a total of four doses of MEDI0457 ( Limited 
Schedule ) before considering a switch to the Indefinite Schedule , provided the safety data 
was supportive and if only no more than a third of t hese patients experience a dose -limiting 
toxicity during their 7- week dose -limiting toxicity evaluation period.  If at any time during the

7 (159) enrollment of these patients, more than a third of the patients experience dose -limiting 
toxicity, then this regimen has exceeded the maximum tolerated dose and the regimen will be 
modified.  The choice of modifications in the Revised Dosing Schedule  during the Safety 
Analysis Run- in include the following: (1)  decrease the dose of durvalumab to 750 mg every 
four weeks or  decrease the total number of durvalumab doses, (2) increase the interval 
between MEDI0457 doses from every [ADDRESS_608750] be evaluated using ei ther the Planned Dosing 
Schedule or Revised Dosing Schedule before study enrollment will continue with a recommended dose and schedule for the combination.  In the Planned Dosing Schedule  both 
MEDI0457 and durvalumab treatment will continue until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.  Either treatment may be stopped by [CONTACT_475091].  See flowchart and Design for Safety Analysis Run- in table below.

Rules  
• A minimum of three patients will be enrolled and if none of the initial patients 
experience a dose- limiting toxicity, then the vaccination schedule will switch 
from the limited four doses ( Limited Schedule ) to the Indefinite Schedule  
(also known as the Planned Dosing Schedule , i.e. vaccinations will continue 
until disease progression).  The Indefinite Schedule  will be implemented for 
all subsequent patients following the Safety Analysis Run- in. 
• If a third of the initial patients experience a dose- limiting toxicity, then a 
minimum of three additional patients (i.e., a minimum total of six patients) 
will be enrolled into the Safety A nalysis Run- in.  These patients will be given 
the Limited Schedule (four doses) of MEDI0457 before considering a switch to the Indefinite Schedule  provided the safety data was supportive and if no 
more than a  third of these patients experience a dose -limiting toxicity during 
their 7 -week dose -limiting toxicity evaluation period.  
• If at any time during the enrollment of these patients, more than a third of 
the  patients experience a dose- limiting toxicity, then this regimen has 
exceeded the maximum tolerated dose and the regimen will be modified:  
Revised Dosing Schedule  (per Safety Data Monitoring Committee).  
• At least a minimum of three patients with no dose -limiting toxicity and up to 
approximately six patients with no more than a third with a dose -limiting 
toxicity must be evaluated using either the Planned Dosing Schedule or 
Revised Dosing Schedule before study enrollment will continue with a 
recommended dose and schedule for the combination.

a Planned Dosing Schedule:  Minimum time between Week [ADDRESS_608751] durvalumab  dose, and the Week  7 MEDI0457 dose and the 
Week  8 durvalumab dose is 7 days.  Starting at Week 12, the administration of MEDI0457 and durvalumab treatments can be given on the same day.  Safety Analysis 
run-in patients will initially receive a total of four  doses of MEDI0457 ( Limited Schedule ) as per schedule above.  Based on the rules shown in the Design for Safety 
Analysis Run -in table, the Limited Schedule  (four doses) will be swi tched to the Indefinite Schedule (also known as the Planned Schedule ). 
b A Revised Dosing Schedule  will be evaluated in up to six patients if two or more patients during the Safety Analysis Run-in period experience a dose-limiting 
toxicity.

27 (159) 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study  
Head and neck cancer accounts for about 3% of all cancers in the [LOCATION_002].  In 2016, an 
estimated 61,760 people (45,330 men and 16,430 women) will develop head and neck cancer.  
It is estimated that 13,190 deaths (9,800 men and 3,390 women) will occur in [ADDRESS_608773], a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_475055] (HPV) infection.  
The oropharynx is uniquely susceptible to HPV, and now up to 70% of oropharyngeal cancers in the [LOCATION_002] are HPV -related.  The HP V viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, are 
predominantly responsible for oncogenesis.  E6 promotes degradation of p53, indirectly activates telomerase, and disrupts the function of the cellular phosphatase tumor suppressor PTPN13.  E7 inactivates retinoblastoma protein and activates Mi2beta.  Together, these 
oncogenic alterations result in the expression of p16, drive rapid cellular proliferation, 
suppress or down regulate key tumor suppressor proteins, and lead to cellular immortality.  In addition, E6/E7 expression is required to maintain a malignant transformed phenotype (Scheffner et al 1990 , Jabbar et al 2009).  
While the currently available prophylactic HPV vaccines are highly effective in preventing infection by [CONTACT_163535] [ADDRESS_608774], and therefore are of no 
value for patients already diagnosed with human papi[INVESTIGATOR_284833] 16 (HPV-16) or human 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_284833] 18 (HPV-18) positive head and neck cancer.   
1.1.1 Summary of clinical experience  
[IP_ADDRESS] MEDI0457 with electroporation 
MEDI0457, also known as INO-3112, is a combination of plasmids contained in the drug 
products called VGX-3100 and INO-9012.

[IP_ADDRESS] Durvalumab (investigational name [CONTACT_46054]4736) 
Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) kappa subclass 
that inhibits binding of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1).  The proposed mechanism of action for durvalumab is interference of the interaction of PD-L1, expressed on cancer cells 
and a subset of leukocytes, with the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) molecules on 
antigen -presenting cells and T-cells.  By [CONTACT_28738]-L1 on tumor cells, the mechanism of 
action of durvalumab includes stimulation of the patient’s anti-tumor immune response.

1.2.1 Rationale for t he study  
Although HPV associated head and neck cancers are generally associated with better 
prognosis than non-HPV cancer, approximately 20-25% of patients treated with curative intent for locoregional disease will have disease progression within 3 years ( Ang et al 2010).

Emerging data from anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti- PD-1) / anti-programmed 
death ligand 1 (anti- PD-L1) therapy in head and neck cancer as well as in other solid tumors 
are very promising with a subset of patients showing tumor regression and delayed progression and improvement in surviva l (Ferris et al 2016, Bauml et al 2016) .  Ho wever, a 
majority of patients do not respond to these novel treatments and thus are in need of additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including rational immunotherapy combinations.

the primary endpoints.  The secondary endpoints of immunogenicity, disease control rate 
(DCR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) will be used for deciding if 
further studies are warranted.  In this study, there will be a Safety Analysis Run-in period

combination of HPV vaccine with anti- PD-L1 antibody is expected to enhance HPV -specific 
T-lymphocyte responses, resulting in improved outcome for these patients. 
1.3 Benefit / risk and ethical assessment  
1.3.1 Potential benefits - MEDI0457 
The safety profile of MEDI0457 (INO-3112) with EP has been generally acceptable, although 
this is based on a limited number of patients who received MEDI0457 with EP.  In addition to 
the safety, other benefits that already have been observed include (1) a generation of robust antigen -specific immune responses; (2) clinical benefits in patients with hig h grade cervical 
intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601], including viral clearance and improvement in pathological grade in the lesion area including viral clearance and improvement in pathological grade in the lesion area ( Trimble  et al 2015 ). 
We expect to observe both immune response to MEDI0457 and clinical benefits in most patients in this study.

Inovio EP devices (23 studies).  Inovio EP devices have also been used to deliver DNA vaccines developed outside of Inovio in three different studies and two studies have evaluated 
the tolerability of Inovio EP devices with normal saline.  None of these studies have shown 
any safety concern related to the use of an EP device.  Electroporation indeed significantly enhances DNA transfer to host cells, resulting in robust immune responses ( Sardesai and 
Weiner 2011 ). 
1.3.4 Possible risks - MEDI0457 with electroporation 
DNA based vaccines in general are less risky based on their safety information compared to other forms of vaccines that utilize viral and bacterial vectors.  
In two companion papers by [CONTACT_475095] ( Sheets et al 2006a , Sheets et al 2006b ), potential 
toxicities (both intrinsic and immunotoxicities) and biodistribution profiles were compared for 21 different plasmid DNA constructs, in nine separate Good Laboratory Practice  
(GLP)-compliant studies.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_475056], promoters, and sequen ce inserts, toxicity and biodistribution profiles were similar for all plasmid DNA 
constructs.  With respect to the toxicity assessments, the authors reported that toxicity was 
localized to the site of the injection for all [ADDRESS_608781] been performed for 
eight additional plasmid DNA vaccine candidates developed by [CONTACT_475096].  
Intramuscular (IM) co -administration of interleukin -12 plasmid was evaluated in nonclinical 
studies to support the studies of IM interleukin -12 plasmid in humans.  INO-9012 has been 
used in combinations with other DNA vaccines, including VGX-3100 (i.e., MEDI0457
), in 
several ongoing studies ( HPV-004 Study, HPV-005 Study, HPV-006 Study, PCa -001 Study 
and TRT-001 Study).  There was no safety issue reported from these studies (for further 
details refer  to MEDI0457 Investigator’s Brochure ).

37 (159) Interleukin- [ADDRESS_608782] received a DNA vaccine treatment that contains 
INO-9012 (human interleukin- 12 DNA plasmid).  This may reflect the use of IL -12 as a local 
adjuvant in relatively low concentrations as opposed to the administration of systemic doses.  The study team will continue to vigilantly monitor patients for any possible risk of autoimmune AEs during the trial. 
The EP procedure with CELLECTRA
®5P could cause patient discomfort, such as transient 
injection site edema, swelling, or pain.  Adverse events of administration site reactions are of 
special interest to the Sponsor.  These are defined, for the purpose of this protocol, as all AEs 
occurri ng as a result of the administration of the study treatment.  Guidelines for the grading 
and management of administration site reactions are outlined in Appendix I .  In order to 
regularly monitor possible muscle damage, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) testing is scheduled 
during the study treatment.  
Although safety data are generally acceptable for clinical testing, MEDI0457 is an 
investigational agent, and the full safety profile is unknown.  Additionally, it is unknown 
about the possible risk due to the proposed changes in MEDI0457 administration re gimen in 
this study and its combination in this study with other investigational agent durvalumab.  This 
study will provide additional information on the safety profiles of these study treatments alone and in combination. 
1.3.[ADDRESS_608783] include immune -mediated reactions and their associated 
signs and symptoms, risks due to immunogenicity, and other potential risks.  
Immune -mediated reactions / immune -related AEs (irAEs) that are important risks include: 
dermatitis / rash / pruritus, ALT / AST increases / hepatitis / hepatotoxicity, endocrinopathy 
(i.e., events of hypophysitis / hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297], adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes, 
hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity  (i.e., events of 
encephalitis, peripheral motor and sensory neuropathies, Guillain- Barré, and myasthenia 
gravis), nephritis and increases in serum creatinine, pancreatitis (or laboratory tests suggestive of pancreatitis -  increased serum lipase / increase d serum amylase), myocarditis / pericarditis / 
uveitis, pneumonitis / interstitial lung disease and diarrhea / colitis.  Hypersensitivity and 
serious allergic reaction events include infusion- related reactions, anaphylaxis / serious 
allergic reactions, and  immune complex disease.  These events are managed based on 
established administration and toxicity management guidelines for this entire class of 
therapeutics (see Appendix H , Postow 2015).

38 (159) 1.3.6 Possible risks and mitigations -  MEDI0457 with electroporation + Durvalumab  
Risks observed (administration site re actions) and anticipated (CPK elevations and 
autoimmune AEs [immunogenicity]) with the administration of MEDI0457 with EP are 
described in Section 1.3.4.  Mitigations in place to reduce the adverse effects of MEDI0457 
with EP administration include: rotation of injection sites, patients are educated to promptly 
report potential skin reactions and obtain visual assessment; protocol guidelines are in pl ace 
for management and reporting of injection / administration site reactions; administration of 
MEDI0457 with EP will not occur in an extremity that contains a metal prosthesis or skin 
which is obscured with tattoos or having in the ipsilateral extremity of the chest an electronic defibrillator / pacemaker device; monitoring of possible muscle damage by [CONTACT_475097]; clinical manifestation and laboratory monitoring for immunogenicity; and 
persistent CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_608784] for > 5 days will be considered a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT).  
Clinically significant risks associated with immune oncology drugs (immune -mediated 
reactions and their associated signs / symptoms, and risks due to immunogenicity) have been briefly  discussed in Section 1.3.[ADDRESS_608785] and reduce the 
adverse effects of potential immune- mediated reactions include: eligibility criteria excluding 
certain autoimmune conditions present at baseline, baseline laboratory tests and monitoring 
per protocol; patients educat ed and instructed to notify the sites for any signs / symptoms that 
may represent an immune -mediated reaction; protocol guidelines for dose delay / withdrawal 
physical examinations at each site visit; and enlisting investigators familiar with the latest 
immune oncology toxicity management guidelines ( Appendix H , Postow 2015).  
Risks commonly associated with the administration of any foreign protein include: immune 
complex disease, infusion reactions (durvalumab), and anaphylaxis and serious allergic 
reactions.  Mitigations to monitor, detect, and trea t these potential adverse effects are: 
monitoring for the induction of anti -drug antibodies with signs / symptoms of immune 
complex disease; and monitoring of patients during and after administration of both investigational products (IPs) to detect and tre at anaphylaxis / infusion reactions.  
Management criteria are in the protocol and in the appended immune oncology toxicity 
management guidelines ( Appendix H , Postow 2015).  
1.4 Study design  
This is a Phase 1b/2a, open- label, multi- center study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, 
anti-tumor activity , and immunogenicity of MEDI0457 (also known as INO-3112)  in 
combination with durvalumab (also known as MEDI4736) .  Approximately 50 patients with 
HPV associated recurrent / metastatic SCCHN  will be enrolled in this study.  Approximately 
three to 12 patients (Safety Analysis Run- in patients) will be enrolled and assessed for safety 
before additional patients are enrolled at a recommended dose and schedule for the 
combination.  Because this study is the first time MEDI0457 has been combined with 
durvalumab, the study will start with enrollment of a minimum of three patients who will 
receive four doses of MEDI0457 ( Limited Schedule ) in combination with durvalumab.  Only

39 (159) if the safety analysis of the initial patients who complete the 7 -week DLT evaluation period, is 
deemed acceptable (i.e., none of initial patients experience a DLT), the vaccination schedule 
will switch from the limited four doses ( Limited Schedule ) to the Indefinite  Schedule  (also 
known as the Planned Dosing Schedule , i.e. vaccinations will continue until disease 
progression).  The Indefinite Schedule will be implemented for all subsequent patients following the Safety Analysis Run- in.  Otherwise, if a third of the initial patients experience a 
DLT, a minimum of three  additional patients (i.e., a minimum total of six patients for the 
Safety Analysis Run- in) will be enrolled and the initial minimum six patients in the Safety 
Analysis Run-in cohort will be limited to a total of four doses of MEDI0457 
(Limited  Schedule ) before considering a switch to the Indefinite Schedule , provided the 
safety data was supportive and if only no more than a third of these patients experience a DLT 
during their 7-week DLT evaluation period.  If at any time during the enrollment of these 
patients, more than a third of the patients experience a DLT, then this regimen has exceeded

1. Initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy including another investigational agent  
2. Confirmed PD: the initial assessment of PD by [CONTACT_44993] 1.1 (baseline PD 
assessment) will be confirmed by a repeat evaluation at the next tumor assess ment 
time point, but no sooner than 4 weeks later.  If any tumor assessment time point 
(beyond the first PD assessment) shows ≥ 20% increase in the overall tumor burden 
(the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesions), when compared to the 
baseline PD assessment (the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesions), the patient would be deemed as having confirmed PD and must be discontinued.  
Patients will need to sign an additional informed consent form (ICF) to continue 
treatment beyond the ini tial (unconfirmed) PD assessment.

55 (159) Investigator should discuss the reason for any discontinuation of study treatment with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor prior to any action or within [ADDRESS_608821] categories:  
• Death.  
• Withdrawal of Consent: The patient desired to withdraw from further participation in the study in the absence of an Investigator -determined medical need to withdraw.  
If the patient gave a reason for withdrawal, it should be recorded on CRF.  This 
reason does not allow for further data collection and should not be selected if 
follow -up data co llection of this patient is anticipated by [CONTACT_102].  
• Protocol Deviation: The patient’s findings or conduct failed to meet the protocol entry criteria or failed to adhere to the protocol requirements (e.g., treatment non-compliance, failure to return for  defined number of visits).  The violation 
should be discussed with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor prior to discontinuation of study treatments or study withdrawal.  
• Lost to Follow -up: The patient fails to attend study visits and study personnel are 
unable t o contact [CONTACT_475103].  
• Physician Decision: The patient was terminated for a reason other than those listed 
above by [CONTACT_475104].

56 (159) 3.[ADDRESS_608823] time MEDI0457 has been combined with durvalumab, the study will start with enrollment of a minimum of three patients who will receive four doses of MEDI0457 
(Limited Schedule ) in combination with durvalumab.  Only if the safety analysis of the initial 
patients, who complete the 7- week DLT evaluat ion period, is deemed acceptable (i.e., none of 
the initial patients experience a DLT), the vaccination schedule will switch from the limited four doses ( Limited Schedule ) to the  Indefinite Schedule  (also known as the Planned 
Dosing Schedule , i.e. vaccinat ions will continue until disease progression).  This Indefinite 
Schedule will be implemented for all subsequent patients following the Safety Analysis Run- in.  Otherwise, if a third of the initial patients experience a DLT, a minimum of three 
additional pa tients (i.e., a minimum total of six patients for the Safety Analysis Run -in) will 
be enrolled and the initial minimum six patients in the Safety Analysis Run -in cohort will be 
limited to a total of four doses of MEDI0457 ( Limited Schedule ) before considering a switch 
to the Indefinite Schedule , provided the safety data was supportive and if only no more than a 
third of these patients experienced a DLT during their 7-week DLT evaluation period.  If at 
any time during the enrollment of these patients, more t han a third of the patients experience a 
DLT, then this regimen has exceeded the MTD and the regimen will be modified.  The choice 
of modifications in the Revised Dosing Schedule  during the Safety Analysis Run-in include 
the following: (1) decrease the dos e of durvalumab to 750 mg Q4W or decrease the total 
number of durvalumab doses (2) increase the interval between MEDI0457 doses from every [ADDRESS_608824] be evaluated using either the Planned Dosing Schedule  or 
Revised Dosing Schedule  before study enrollment will continue with a recommended dose 
and schedule for the combination.  
In order to adequately monitor the safety of patients in Study D8860C00005, there will be two 
levels of ongoing monitoring of safety data for this study.

The RAVE Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and 
query handling.  The Investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the electronic CRFs as 
specified in the study protocol and in accordance with the instructions provided. 
The Investigator ensures the  accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and 
of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement.  The 
Investigator will sign the completed electronic CRFs.  A copy of the completed electronic 
CRFs will be archived at the study site.

68 (159) discretion of the Sponsor, an independent central review of all scans used in the assessment of 
tumors by [CONTACT_274219] 1.1 and/or irRECIST may be conducted.  Guidelines for imaging 
collection and storage will be provided in a separate document.  The management of the 
patients will be based solely upon the results of assessment conducted by [CONTACT_475106] 1.1 per protocol.  
The baseline assessment should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of 
MEDI0457 treatment and ideally as close as possible and not later than the start of the IP.  
Efficacy for all patients will be assesse d by [CONTACT_475107] 8 weeks 
(± 5 days) (relative to the date of the first MEDI0457 administration; Table 3) for [ADDRESS_608839] year on treatment, if CR / partial response (PR) / SD are achieved then disease 
status assessments can be performed every 12 weeks ( ± 7 days) until the end of treatment.  
Disease status assessments will be performed once at the end of treatment if PD is observed, otherwise at end of treatment and then at Day 90 ± 7 days, every 3 months after Day  90 up to 
Month 12 ±  7 days then every 6 months after Month 12 ±  14 days until t he death of the 
patient, withdrawal of consent or loss to follow -up.  Disease assessment will also stop if 
patient is started on subsequent anticancer therapy.  If an unscheduled assessment is performed, and the patient has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the 
subsequent assessments at their scheduled visits ( ± 14 days).   
For patients who discontinue therapy due to toxicity in the absence of confirmed objective 
progression, disease status assessments should be continued until confirm ed PD or start of 
subsequent anticancer therapy.  
Patients who discontinued from treatment for reasons other than PD will continue disease assessments until confirmed PD or start of subsequent anticancer therapy.  
Progression would be considered confirmed i f the following criterion is met: 
• Confirmed PD: the initial assessment of PD by [CONTACT_44993] 1.1 (baseline PD assessment) will be confirmed by a repeat evaluation at the next tumor assessment time point, but no sooner than 4 weeks later.  If any tumor as sessment time point 
(beyond the first PD assessment) shows ≥ 20% increase in the overall tumor burden (the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesions), when compared to the baseline PD assessment (the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesi ons), the 
patient would be deemed as having confirmed PD and must be discontinued from treatment.  Patients will need to sign an additional ICF to continue treatment beyond the initial (unconfirmed) PD assessment.  
In the absence of clinically significant d eterioration, the Investigator should continue study 
treatment until progression is confirmed.  
If progression is not confirmed, the patient should continue on study treatment and on-treatment assessments.

Date 17 March 2021 
69 (159) If a patient discontinues treatment prior to progre ssion, the patient should still continue to be 
followed until confirmed objective disease progression or until subsequent anticancer 
treatment.  
If the Investigator is in doubt as to whether progression has occurred, particularly with response to non- target  lesion or the appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to continue 
treatment until the next scheduled assessment or sooner if clinically indicated and reassess the 
patient’s status.  If repeat scans confirm progression, then the date of the initial sca n should be 
declared as the date of progression.  
Tumor assessments should include the following evaluations: physical examination (with photograph and measurement of skin lesions as applicable) and CT or MRI scan of the neck, 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis (pe lvic scan is optional unless known pelvic disease is present at 
baseline).  Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain will be performed at screening and 
also at each assessment if the patient is found to have abnormalities at baseline scan.  The 
preferred method of disease assessment is CT with contrast except for brain metastasis where an MRI with contrast is preferred.  If CT with contrast is contraindicated, CT without contrast 
is preferred over MRI.  A CT with contrast may be substituted for an MRI w ith contrast if an 
MRI is contraindicated.  The same method is preferred for all subsequent tumor assessments 
for the same patient.  Note: if a patient receives a combined positron emission tomography (
PET) / diagnostic quality CT scan at screening, a CT s can without PET later in the study is 
acceptable.  
The response to immunotherapy may differ from the typi[INVESTIGATOR_475061] ( Wolchok et al 2009, Nishino et al 2013):  
• Response to immunotherapy may be delayed.  
• Response to immunotherapy may occur a fter PD by [CONTACT_428916].  
• The appearance of new lesions may not represent PD with immunotherapy. 
• Stable disease while on immunotherapy may be durable and represent clinical benefit.  
Progression free survival measures progression by [CONTACT_475108], nodal spread metastases, death from the cancer, or death from other causes.  Progression free survival will be assessed by [CONTACT_475109] 3.  
All study evaluations for disease response must be based on RECIST version 1.1.

Based on the above -described unique response to immunotherapy and based on guidelines 
from regulatory agencies, e.g., European Medicines Agency’s “Guideline on the evaluation of 
anti-cancer medicinal products in man” (EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev.4)  for immune modulating 
anticancer compounds, the study will implement the following in addition to standard 
RECIST version  1.1: 
• RECIST  will be modified so that PD must be confirmed at the next scheduled visit, 
preferably, and no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of PD in the 
absence of clinically significant deterioration.  Treatment with MEDI0457 and 
durvalumab would continue between the initial assessment of progression and confirmation for progression.  
5.4 Safety assessments 
5.4.1 Laboratory safety assessments  
At screening, blood samples will be collected for hematology and serum chemistry.  Blood samples will also be taken for  LH and FSH (for select patients), CPK, thyroid function testing 
(if thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH] is abnormal then free triiodothyronine [T
3] and free 
thyroxine [T 4] will be required to be measured, if TSH is normal then free T 3 and free T 4 are 
not re quired to measured), coagulation tests (activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT] 
and either International Normalized Ratio [INR] or prothrombin time), hepatitis B and 
hepatitis C testing.  Testing for HIV is only required if clinically indicated and is  not 
mandatory for this study.  A urine sample will also be obtained to determine eligibility (see 
Table 2 ).  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed  for women of childbearing potential at the 
screening visit. A urine pregnancy test will be performed during the treatment period. 
A local laboratory will be used for the collection of blood and urine samples (see Laboratory 
Manual for further details).   
Blood and urine samples will be collected during the IP administration period for 
determination of hematology, serum chemistry, CPK, thyroid function testing (TSH, free T 3 
and free T 4), coagulation tests (prothrombin time, APTT and INR).  A urine pregnancy test 
will be taken at the times indicated in Table 3.  Urinalysis will be taken if clinically indicated 
as deemed by [CONTACT_737] ( Table 3 ). 
Additional baseline blood samples will be also collected in a [ADDRESS_608840] serum samples collected at baseline for future analysis which includes but is not limited to an autoimmune work- up (Table 3) (refer to the Laboratory Manual for the processing of 
this sample).

pressure and pulse will be collected from patients receiving durvalumab before, during and after each infusion at the following ti mes (based on a 60  minute infusion):  
• Prior to the beginning of the infusion (measured once from approximately 
30 minutes before up to 0 minutes [i.e., the start of the infusion]).  
• Approximately every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) after start of the infusion (ha lf way 
through the infusion). 
• At the end of the infusion (approximately 60 minutes ± 5 minutes). 
• A 1 hour (± 15 minutes) observation period is required after each infusion of 
durvalumab is administered if clinically significant infusion reactions are obser ved 
during or after the first dose and at Investigator discretion . 
If no clinically significant infusion reactions are observed during or after the first dose, the 
length of subsequent infusion observation periods can occur at the Investigator’s discretion (suggested 30 minutes after each durvalumab infusion).  If the infusion duration exceeds 
[ADDRESS_608847] clinical 
practice or as clinically indicated.

76 (159) 5.4.8 Electrocardiogram  
An ECG will be performed at screening within 28 days of Day 0 for all patients to determine 
patient eligibility and as clinically indicated throughout the study.  Three 12- lead ECG 
recordings are required in triplicate (all three ECG assessments within a 5 minute time period) at the screening visit.  
The following parameters will be recorded for each ECG: da te and time of ECG, HR 
(beats/min), PR interval (ms), RR interval (ms), QRS interval (ms), QT interval (ms), QTcF 
interval (for Fridericia’s) (ms), QTcB interval (ms), sinus rhythm (yes / no), and overall 
evaluation (normal / abnormal).  
Abnormal ECGs shoul d be interpreted as clinically significant or not clinically significant.  
In case of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including a QTcF value >  470 ms, 
two additional 12- lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (e.g., 30 minutes) to 
confirm  the finding.   
Electrocardiograms should be obtained after the patient has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] 5 minutes and recorded while the patient remains in that position.  Electrocardiograms will be 
performed in triplicate.  Electrocardiograms will be re ad and collected locally and held in 
digital format by [CONTACT_274972].  
Electrocardiograms are to be collected in triplicate (all three ECG assessments within a 5 minute time period)  within 30 minutes before dosing of MEDI0457 and 30- 60 minutes after 
dosing at Weeks 1, 3, 7 and 12 and thereafter single ECGs at pre -dose at subsequent dosing 
visits.  Triplicate (all three ECG assessments within a 5 minute time period) ECGs will be performed within 30 minutes before dosing of MEDI4736 at Week 4 and 30- 60 minu tes after 
dosing of MEDI4736 at Weeks 4 and 12.  An ECG assessment can also be performed if clinically indicated and according to the Investigator. 
5.4.9 Other safety assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of anxiety and pain due to electroporation procedure  
Patients will be of fered topi[INVESTIGATOR_475063] (e.g., EMLA [lidocaine +  prilocaine ]), to prevent 
significant discomfort from the study treatment procedure.  If EMLA (lidocaine 2.5% and 
prilocaine 2.5%) is used, an approximately 1.5 cm diameter amount will be applied with occlus ion to the site of injection ~30 minutes prior to study treatment.  
Patients may be offered a mild sedative (e.g., 0.5- 1 mg lorazepam) for anxiety related to the 
EP procedure.  Mild sedatives may be administered approximately [ADDRESS_608848] arranged transportation to depart the study 
site. 
Patients will be offered an analgesic (e.g., ibuprofen, ketorolac) after study treatment.  Note: The use of any narcotic (including Tylenol
® [acetaminophen] with codeine) for pain meets the

77 (159) definition of severe pain (Grade 3) and therefore will not be offered to the patients unless 
clinically indicated.  
Patients who are allergic t o or have contraindications to ibuprofen, ketorolac or lorazepam 
will be offered a suitable alternative.  
Medications administered to manage anxiety and pain due to the EP procedure will be captured as concomitant medications on the CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of durvalumab administration  
 
  
Note: Per Inclusion criterion 3, patients who weigh < 30 kg will recei ve durvalumab at 
20 mg/kg at every 4 weeks and if their weight increases to ≥  30 kg they can be switched to 
durvalumab at 1500 mg every 4 weeks.  If in the course of the study after the Safety Analysis 
Run-in the dose is reduced to 750 mg of durvalumab, then patients who weigh ≤ 30 kg will 
receive durvalumab at 10 mg/kg at every 4 weeks and if their weight increases to ≥ 30 kg they can be switched to durvalumab at 750 mg every 4 weeks.  
The following steps apply specifically to durvalumab.  Each dose of durvalumab should be administered using the following guidelines: 
• Investigational product must be administered at room temperature by [CONTACT_218447] a peripheral vein or central line.  Prior to the start of the infusion, ensure that the bag contents are at room temperature to avoid an infusion reaction due to the administration of the solution at low temperatures. 
• A physician must be present at the site or immediately available to respond to emergencies during all administrations of IP.  Fully functional resuscitation facilities should be available.  Investigational product must not be administered via 
IV push or bolus but as a slow IV infusion.  The entire content of each IV bag will 
be infused. 
• Lines used for infusion during dose administration will need to be equipped with 0.22- or 0.2- μm in -line filters.  
• Some IP may remain in the IV line after the infusion has completed.  A volume of IV solution equal to the priming volume of the infusion set should be used to flush 
the lines.  A separate flush bag may be used to clear the line or remaining IP.  The 
infusion rate should not be changed.  The infusion should be completed according to the institutional policy to ensure that the full dose of the IP is administered.  It will be documented if the line was not flushed.

Patients will be monitored during and after the infusion with assessment of vital signs at the 
times specified in the study protocol. 
In the event of a ≤  Grade 2 infusion- related reaction, th e infusion rate of study drug may be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event and re- initiated at 50% of the 
initial rate until completion of the infusion.  For patients with a ≤  Grade 2 infusion- related 
reaction, subsequent infusions may be administered at 50% of the initial rate.  If the patient 
tolerates subsequent infusions without reaction, the infusion rate may be increased again back 
to the initial infusion rate.  Acetaminophen and / or an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per institutional standard may be administered at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  If the infusion- related reaction is ≥  Grade [ADDRESS_608849] immediate acc ess to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition 
to the ability to admit patients to an intensive care unit if necessary.  
Note: Any infusion-related reaction is considered as an AESI.  As soon an AE is entered into the Medidata RAVE system by [CONTACT_475111], then the site must inform 
MedImmune within [ADDRESS_608850]-infusion.  If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_54571] r, the infusion-related reaction is considered to be an SAE, then the infusion- related 
reaction should be reported as an SAE. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of clinical adverse events  
Patients will be questioned by [CONTACT_475112], 
concomitant medications and new onset chronic disease during their clinic visits.  Patients will 
be reminded to contact [CONTACT_475113].  These events will be recorded on the patient’s CRF.

The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_367383].  
6.[ADDRESS_608852] medical occurrence associated with th e use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related ( Guidance for Industry and Investigators ). 
In this study, such changes will be monit ored, classified, and summarized, and as Clinical or 
Laboratory AEs, respectively.  Medical condition / diseases present before starting the 
investigational drug will be considered AEs only if they worsen after starting study treatment. 
An unexpected  AE is  one not identified in the Investigator’s Brochures ( MEDI0457 
Investigator’s Brochure  and Durvalumab Investigator ’s Brochure ) or otherwise not expected 
from the characteristics of the clinical material.  
Adverse events include the following:  
• Pre- or post -treatment complications that occur as a result o f protocol -mandated 
procedure during or after the first screening visit (before the administration of study drug).  
• Any pre -existing condition that increases in severity, or changes in nature during or 
as a consequence of the study drug phase of a human cli nical trial, will also be 
considered an AE.  
• Complications and termination of pregnancy; see Section 6.11 for additional information. 
• All AEs that oc cur from the study screening visits onwards and throughout the 
duration of the study, including the follow -up off -study treatment period should be 
recorded as an AE.

Date 17 March 2021 
86 (159) Adverse events do not include the following:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion) performed; the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE.  
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions or laboratory abnormalities present or detected 
before the screening visits that do not worsen.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], social and / or convenience admissions). 
• Overdose without clinical sequelae.  
• Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol associated procedure is not an AE.  It is considered to be pre -existing and should be 
documented on the medical history CRF. 
• Uncomplicated pregnancy (documented on a pregnancy CRF).  
• An induced elective abortion to terminate a pregnancy without medical reason 
(documented on a pregnancy CRF).  
The term AE is used to include both serious and non- serious AEs.  
6.[ADDRESS_608853] ion is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening 
AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or 
significa nt incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, 
or a congenital anomaly / birth defect.  Important medical events that may not results in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475066], they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse ( Guidance for 
Industry and Investigators ). 
Clarification of Serious Adverse Events  
• Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself.  Note: death due to disease 
progression is not considered to be an SAE (see Section 6.7.13 for further details).

87 (159) • The patient may not have been on IP at the occurrence of the event.  Administration 
may have been given as treatment cycles or interrupted temporarily before the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to the event. 
• “Life- threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred.  This does not include an event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity.  
• Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176].  If a complication prolongs the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99324] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475067], for any length of time.  This may or may not be overnight.  It 
does not include presentation and care within an emergency department.  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis  of signs, 
symptoms, and / or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and / or SAE and not the individual signs / symptoms. 
Serious adverse events that are ongoing should be followed until resolution.  The r eporting 
period for SAEs is described in Section 6.8. 
For further guidance on the definition of an SAE, see Ap pendix A  to the Clinical Study 
Protocol. 
6.3 Definition of adverse reactions  
An adverse reaction means any AE caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event 
(Guidance for Industry and Investigators ). 
6.4 Definition of suspected adverse r eactions  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE.  For the purposes of Investigational New Drug (IND) safety reporting, 
‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug ( Guidance for Industry 
and Investigators ). 
6.5 Definition of unexpected events / reactions  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure or is not liste d as the specificity or severity that has been observed; or 
if an Investigator’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as am ended.  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
88 (159) unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the Investigator’s Brochure referred only to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vascul itis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the Investigator Brochure 
listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  ‘‘Unexpected’’ as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Invest igator’s Brochure as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation ( Guid ance for Industry and Investigators ). 
6.6 Definition of life -threatening events / reactions  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’ if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death.  It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death ( Guidance for Industry and Investigators ). 
6.[ADDRESS_608854] study treatment.  Note: AEs / SAEs that occur post-signature [CONTACT_475148]- treatment -emergent AEs / SAEs.  When a 
patient is defined as a screen failure,  AE data will not be collected in the CRF.  The site will 
document AE data and keep the data in their files at the site.  
6.7.2 Methods and timing of the collection and recording of adverse events  
After study treatment: Patients will be directly observed by [CONTACT_475114] 30- 60 minutes 
after each administration of MEDI0457 IM+EP for immediate reactions.  Injection sites will 
also be assessed at the subsequent study visit.  
The occurrence and severity of any AE during this period will be recorded on the appropr iate 
CRF.  Patients will be given an oral thermometer and instructed to take and record their temperature daily (at the same time each day).  
Throughout the study: Patients will also be questioned by [CONTACT_475115], concomitant medications and new onset chronic disease 
during their clinic visits.  Patients will be reminded to contact [CONTACT_475116].  If events occur, these events wil l be recorded on the patient’s CRF.  
On study treatment visits, the assessments will be performed prior to administration.  Study patients will be queried at each clinic visit regarding the occurrence of any AEs, including 
SAEs that may have occurred since  the last visit.  They will be reminded to contact [CONTACT_475117].  
These events will be recorded on the CRFs.

89 (159) 6.7.3 Follow -up of unresolved adverse events  
During the course of the study, all AEs and SAEs should be proactively followed up for each 
patient.  Every effort should be made to obtain a resolution for all events, even if the events continue after discontinuation or study completion. 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the pati ent’s last visit in the study are followed up by [CONTACT_149798], with follow -up data recording in the CRF.  
MedImmune retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing 
AE(s) / SAE(s) at th e end of the study, if judged necessary.  
6.7.4 Variables  
The following variables will be collected for each AE:  
• Adverse event (verbatim)  
• The date and time when the AE started and stopped 
• Each CTCAE grade for a repeated AE  
• Whether the AE is serious or not  
• Investigator causality rating against the IP (yes or no)  
• Action taken with regard to IP  
• Administration of treatment for the AE  
• Whether the AE caused the patient’s withdrawal from the study (yes or no)  
• Outcome  
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: 
• Date AE met criteria for serious AE  
• Date Investigator became aware of serious AE  
• Seriousness criteria fulfilled  
• Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Date of discharge  
• Probable cause of death  
• Date of death

90 (159) • Whether an autopsy was performed  
• Causality assessment in relation to study procedure(s) and other medication(s)  
• Description of AE  
The grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE version 4.03 will be utilized for all 
events with an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, 
the recommendation in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate, and severe events 
into CTCAE grades should be used.   
It is imp ortant to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 6.2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in S ection 6.2. 
6.7.5 Severity codes for adverse events  
Study personnel will grade laboratory AEs and clinical AEs (based on discussions with study participan ts) with respect to the following levels of severity as defined in NCI CTCAE version 
4.03. 
The determination of severity for all other events not listed in the CTCAE should be made by 
[CONTACT_475118] 1 to 5 as defined below:  
• Grade 1 (mild): An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic interv ention.  The event does not generally interfere with 
usual activities of daily living (ADL).  
• Grade 2 (moderate): An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention.  The event interferes with usual ADL, causing discomfort  
but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the patient. 
• Grade 3 (severe): An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention.  The event interrupts usual ADL, or significantly affects the clinical status of the patient.  
• Grade 4 (life -threatening): An event, and / or its immediate sequelae, that is 
associated with an imminent risk of death or with physical or mental disabilities that affect or limit the ability of the patient to perform ADL (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc).  
• Grade 5 (fa tal): Death (loss of life) as a result of an event.

91 (159) 6.7.[ADDRESS_608855] a possible, probable or definite relationship to the 
administration of the IP and / or the inve stigational device.  An AE may also be assessed as 
not related to the IP and / or the investigational device.  Because the Investigator is 
knowledgeable about the patient (e.g., medical history, concomitant medications), administers 
the IP, and monitors the patient’s response to the IP, the Investigator is responsible for reporting AEs and judging the relationship between the administration of the IP and EP and a 
subsequent AE.  The Investigator is aware of the patient’s clinical state and thus may be 
sensi tive to distinctions between events due to the underlying disease process versus events 
that may be product related and may have observed the event.  The Sponsor will assess the 
overall safety of the IP delivered by [CONTACT_475119].  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the Study Patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an 
AE is considered to be related  to the IP and / or the investigational device indicating "yes" or 
"no" accordingly.  Causality should be assessed by [CONTACT_5256] “yes, related” or “no, unrelated” by [CONTACT_4868]:  
• Yes – there is a reasonable possibility that administration of the Study Treatment 
contributed to the event.  
• No – there is no reasonable possibility that administration of the Study Treatment 
contributed to the event and there are more likely causes.  
The following guidance should also be taken into consideration:  
• Temporal relationship of event to administration of IP and / or EP. 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of IP, or reintroduction of IP (where applicable).  
• Known association of the event with the IP, EP or with similar treatments.  
• Known association of the event with the disease under study. 
• Presence of risk factors in the Study Patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event.  
The Investigator is also required to provide an assessment of relationship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the SAE Report Form.  This includes non- treatment -emergent SAEs (i.e., SAEs 
that occur prior to the administration of IP) as well as treatment- emergent SAEs.  A 
protocol -related SA E may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention required during the 
study (e.g., blood collection, washout of an existing medication).  The following guidelines 
should be used by [CONTACT_95108]:  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
92 (159) Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure / intervention that was described in 
the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the patient’s medical record.  
Not protocol related: The event is related to an etiology other than t he procedure / intervention 
that was described in the protocol (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study 
patient’s medical record).  
6.7.7 Relationship to protocol procedures  
The Investigator is also required to provide an assessment of the relati onship of SAEs to 
protocol procedures on the SAE Report Form.  This includes both non- treatment- emergent 
(i.e., SAEs that occur prior to the administration of IP) and treatment -emergent SAEs.  A 
protocol -related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention required during the 
study (e.g., blood collection).  The following guidelines should be used by [CONTACT_95108]:  
• Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure or intervention that was described in the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the patient’s medical record.  
• Not protocol related: The event is related to an etiology other than the procedure or 
intervention that was described in the protocol.  The alternative etiology must be 
documented in the study patient’s medical record.  
6.7.8 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms  
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_475120]: “Have you had any healt h problems since the previous visit / you 
were last asked?” or revealed by [CONTACT_129158].  
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred, when possible, to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms.  Howe ver, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or 
symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom 
will be recorded separately.  
6.7.9 Adverse events based on examinations and tests  
The results from protocol -mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the 
Clinical Study Report.  Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated laboratory 
values and vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IP.  
If deterioration in a laboratory value / vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result 
/ vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting 
Investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anemia versus low 
hemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non- mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).

93 (159) Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE / SAE. 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnorm al medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.  
6.7.10 Abnormal laboratory value  
Laboratory abnormalities are only to be reported as AEs, if the Investigator feels they are 
clinically significant.  At the time of entry, the site physician will grade the laboratory 
abnormality that they feel is an AE.  Other laboratory abnormalities will not be graded.  In 
addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (e.g., ECG, x- rays, vital signs) that are 
associated with signs and / or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the 
definition of an AE (or SAE) as described in Sections 6.[ADDRESS_608856] the syndrome or diagnosis (e.g., anemia) not the laboratory result (e.g., decreas ed hemoglobin).  
Any laboratory abnormality that is new in onset or worsened in severity or frequency from the baseline condition and meets one of the following criteria will be recorded as an AE:  
• Requires therapeutic intervention or diagnostic tests  
• Leads to discontinuation of study treatment  
• Has accompanying or inducing symptoms or signs  
• Is judged by [CONTACT_475121].  Each CTCAE grading term in the current version is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical documentation and scientific analysis and is a single Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Lowest Level Term.  Note: the most current version of MedDRA will be used. 
Investigators are ask ed to take the CTCAE grading criteria into account when assessing if a 
laboratory abnormality qualifies as a laboratory AE.  Their clinical judgment ultimately 
determines whether the abnormality in question is “clinically significant” or “not clinically 
significant” and the severity of the event.  CTCAE grading can be used as a reference when 
making this determination.  It is the responsibility of the investigators to ensure all AEs are accurately reported and graded.

Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the IP is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and / or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of 
new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be 
considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE during the study. 
6.7.[ADDRESS_608858] be reported as follows:  
• Death clearly resulting from disease progression should be reported to the St udy 
Physician at the next monitoring visit and should be documented in the CRF.  It 
should not be reported as an SAE. 
• Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease under 
study, the AE causing the death must be reported to the St udy Physician as an SAE 
within 24 hours.  The report should contain a comment regarding the 
co-involvement of PD, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory 
causes of death.  
• Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE.  A post-mortem examination may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, 
and if performed, a copy of the post -mortem results should be forwarded to 
MedImmune Drug Safety or its representative within the usual timeframes.  
6.[ADDRESS_608859] to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the study procedure(s).  All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF. 
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform  
the appropriate MedImmune representatives within one day i.e., immediately but no later 
than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it . 
PRA works with the Investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the 
MedImmune Patient Safety Data Entry Site within 1  calendar day  of initial receipt for fatal 
and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar  days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.  
For fatal or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, ac tive 
follow -up is undertaken immediately.  Investigators or other site personnel inform 
MedImmune representatives of any follow -up information on a previously reported SAE 
within one calendar day i.e., immediately but  no later than 24 hours of when he or s he 
becomes aware of it .

submitting an IND safety report, the Sponsor needs to ensure that the event meets all three of 
the definitions ( Guidance for Industry and Investigators ): 
• Suspected adverse reaction  
• Serious  
• Unexpected  
If the AE does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an IND 
safety report.  
The timeframe for submitting an IND safety report, any serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction which is not fatal or life -threatening to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is 
no later than 15 calendar days  after the Sponsor determines that the suspected adverse 
reaction or other information qualifies for reporting. 
Unexpected fatal or life- threatening suspected adverse reactions shall be reported by [CONTACT_475122] 7 calendar days  after the Sponsor’s initial receipt of the 
information (in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32(c)(2)).  
The day of initial receipt for cases that are interpretable as single cases and the day the 
Sponsor determines that multiple cases qualify for expedited reporting are considered day zero.  
If FDA requests any additional data or information, the Sponsor shall submit it to FDA as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_608861] (in

An overdose is defined as a pa tient receiving a dose of IP(s) in excess of that specified in the 
Investigator’s Brochures ( MEDI0457 Investigator’s Brochure  and Durvalumab Investigator’s 
Brochure ), unless otherwise specified in this protocol. 
Any overdose of a study patient with IP, with or without associated AEs / SAEs, is require d to 
be reported within [ADDRESS_608862] also be recorded as an AE (see Section 6.7).  
Overdose does not automatically make an AE serious, but if the consequences of the overdose 
are serious, for example death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is serious and must be recorded and 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.8).  There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose of either MEDI0457 or durvalumab (see M EDI0457 Investigator’s Brochure  and 
Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure ).  
The Invest igator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.  
• An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis / symptoms on the relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module.  
• An overdose without associated symptoms is only report ed on the Overdose CRF 
module. 
If an overdose on a MedImmune study drug occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate MedImmune representatives immediately, or no later than [ADDRESS_608863] interfered with the eff ectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  Congenital 
abnormalities / birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.

Either treatment may be stopped by [CONTACT_475091]. 
MEDI0457 and durvalumab dose should not be modified.  
Durvalumab: For AEs that are considered at least partly due to administration of durvalumab 
the following dose adjustment guidance may be applied:  
• Treat each of the toxicities with maximum supportive care (including holding durvalumab).  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
98 (159) • If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, consideration should be 
given to continuing the same dose of durvalumab along with appropriate continuing 
supportive care.  If medically appropriate, dose modifications are permitted for 
durvalumab.  
• All dose modifications should be documented with clear medical reasoning and documentation of the approach tak en. 
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which durvalumab should be permanently 
discontinued ( Appendix H, Postow 2015).  
Following the first dose of durvalumab, subsequent administration of durvalumab can be 
modified based on toxicities observed ( Appendi x H, Postow 2015).  All toxicities will be 
graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03. 
Based on the mechanism of action of durvalumab leading to T -cell activation and 
proliferation, there is the possibility of observing irAEs during the conduct of this study.  
Potential irAEs include immune -mediated dermatitis, hepatitis / hepatotoxicity, 
endocrinopathy (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, and adrenal insufficiency), 
neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity, nephritis, pancreatiti s (elevated lipase / amylase), 
pneumonitis, and colitis.  Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs.  In 
the absence of an alternate etiology (e.g., infection or PD) signs or symptoms of dermatitis, 
hepatitis / hepatotoxicity, endocrinopathy (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, 
and adrenal insufficiency), neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity, nephritis, pancreatitis (elevated lipase / amylase), pneumonitis, and colitis should be considered to be immune -
related.  Refer to the lat est Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure  for more information. 
Dose modifications will not be required for AEs that are clearly not attributable to durvalumab (such as an accident) or for laboratory abnormalities that are not deemed to be clinically 
significant.  Administration may continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_475069].  
Acetaminophen and / or an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per institutional standard may be administered prior to infusion at the discretion of the 
Investigator for primary prophylaxis against infusion- related reactions. For more information 
on dose modification for immune -related reactions please refer to Appendix  H.  
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible.  Appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylac tic reactions must be immediately 
available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis.  The study 
site must have immediate access to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition to the ability to admit patients to a n intensive care unit if necessary.

100 ( 159) The DLT definition excludes the following conditions:  
• Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤ 7 days. 
• Grade 3 endocrine disorder (thyroid, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], and / or adrenal insufficiency) that is 
managed with or without systemic corticosteroid therapy and / or hormone 
replacement therapy and the patient is asymptomatic.  
• Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local anti- tumor response (e.g., 
inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes, etc).  
• Concurrent vitiligo or alopecia of any AE grade.  
• Grade 3 infusion- related reaction (first occurrence and in the absence of steroid 
prophylaxis) that resolves within 6 hours with appropriate clinical management. 
• Grade [ADDRESS_608869] one grade within 3 days.  Grade 3 or Grade 4 febrile neutropenia will be a DLT  regardless of duration or reversibility. 
• Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia. 
• Grade [ADDRESS_608870] one grade within 3 days. 
• Isolated Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical signs or symptoms and are reversed w ith appropriate maximal medical intervention 
within 3 days. 
Immune -related AEs are defined as AEs of immune nature (i.e., inflammatory) in the absence 
of a clear alternative etiology.  In the absence of clinical abnormality, repeat laboratory testing will be conducted to confirm significant laboratory findings prior to designation as a DLT.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Events requiring expedited reporting within 24 hours  
Overdose  
An overdose is defined as a patient receiving a dose of IP in excess of that specified in the 
Investigator’ s Brochures ( MEDI0457 Investigator’s Brochure  and Durvalumab Investigator’s 
Brochure ), unless otherwise specified in this protocol. 
Any overdose of a study patient with IP , with or without associated A Es / SAEs, is required to 
be reported within [ADDRESS_608871] also be recorded as an AE (see Section 6.7).  Overdose does not automatically make an AE s erious, but if the consequences of the overdose 
are serious, for example death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is serious and must be recorded and

101 ( 159) reported as an SAE (see Section 6.8).  There is currently no specific treatment in the event of 
an overdose of MEDI0457 or durvalumab.  
The Investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.  
Hepatic Function Abnormality 
Hepatic function abnormalit y (as defined in Section 6.12.4) in a study patient, with or without 
associated clinical manifestations, is required to be reported as “hepatic fun ction abnormal” 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to the Sponsor or designee unless a definitive 
underlying diagnosis for the abnormality (e.g., cholelithiasis or bile duct obstruction) that is 
unrelated to IP has been confirmed.  
If the definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality has been established and is unrelated 
to IP, the decision to continue administration of the study patient will be based on the clinical 
judgment of the investigator. 
If no definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality is established, administration of IP to 
the study patient must be interrupted immediately.  Follow -up investigations and inquiries 
must be initiated by [CONTACT_38238].  Each reported event of hepatic 
function abnormality will be followed by [CONTACT_475123]. 
Hy’s Law  
Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation 
and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ [ADDRESS_608872] together with TBL  ≥ [ADDRESS_608873] may need to be 
reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix D for further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law ( HL). 
Pregnancy  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the IP shoul d be discontinued 
immediately.   
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_178517] a contraceptive medication.  Congenital 
abnormalities or birth defects and spontane ous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the patient was discontinued from the study.   
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel 
should inform the Sponsor or designee within 1 day, i .e., immediately, but no later than 
24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.

103 ( 159) 6.12.[ADDRESS_608875] for MEDI0457 and durvalumab include but are not limited 
to events with a potential inflammatory or immune -mediated mechanism and which m ay 
require more frequent monitoring and / or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants 
and / or hormone replacement therapy.  These AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical 
studies with durvalumab monotherapy and combination therapy.  An irAE  is defined as an AE 
that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune -mediated mechanism 
of action and where there is no clear alternate etiology.  Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used t o support an irAE diagnosis.  
Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or 
other etiologic causes of the irAE.  If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an AE 
being an irAE, the Investigator should promptly contact [CONTACT_38234].  Identified risks 
(listed / expected reactions) for durvalumab include:  diarrhea, ALT increase, AST increase, 
pneumonitis, and colitis / enterocolitis.  
Adverse events of special interest observed with MEDI0457 and durvalumab include:  
• Diarrhea / colitis  
• Pneumonitis  
• ALT / AST increases / hepatitis / hepatotoxicity  
• Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity (i.e., events of encephalitis, peripheral motor 
and sensory neuropathies, Guillain- Barré, and myasthenia gravis)  
• Endocrinopathy (i.e., events of hypophysitis, hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297], adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism)  
• Dermatitis / rash / pruritus  
• Nephritis  
• Pancreatitis (or laboratory tests suggestive of pancreatitis -  increased seru m lipase,

Hy’s Law
 
Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ [ADDRESS_608876] together with TBL  ≥ [ADDRESS_608877] may need to be 
reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix D  for further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry and evaluation of HL .   
Colitis:  
Diarrhea, colitis, and enterocolitis are irAEs that have been reported with durvalumab.  In rare cases, colon perforation may occur that requires surgery (colectomy) or can lead to a fatal outcome if not properly managed.  Diarrhea / colitis in patients r eceiving durvalumab should 
be managed as per the guidelines for the management of diarrhea and enterocolitis (refer to 
Appendix H ). 
Pneumonitis:  
Adver se events of pneumonitis are also of interest for the Sponsor.  Initial work- up should 
include high- resolution CT scan, ruling out infection, and pulse oximetry.  Pulmonary 
consultation is highly recommended.  For guidelines for management of patients with 
pneumonitis refer to Appendix H . 
Hypersensitivity Reactions:  
Hypersensitivity reactions as well as infusion -related reactions have been reported with 
anti-PD-L1 and anti -PD-1 therapy ( Brahmer et al 2012 ).  As with the administration of any 
foreign protein and / or other biologic agents, reactions following the infusion of monoclonal 
antibodies can be caused by [CONTACT_475124] m echanisms, including acute anaphylactic 
(immunoglobulin E -mediated) and anaphylactoid reactions against the monoclonal antibodies, 
and serum sickness.  Acute allergic reactions may occur, may be severe, and may result in death.  Acute allergic reactions may include hypotension, dyspnea, cyanosis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518], urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, hypotonia, urticaria, arthralgia, bronchospasm,

unresponsiveness.  For guidelines for management of patients with hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reactions) refer to Appendix H .  
Infusion- Related Reactions:  
Adverse events of infusion reactions (also termed infusion- related reactions) are of special 
interest to the Sponsor and are defined, for the purpose of this protocol, as all AEs occurring 
from the start of the study treatment infusion up to 48 hours after t he infusion start time.  For 
all infusion reactions, the electronic CRF should be completed as instructed in Section  6.7, 
and all SAEs should be reported to MedImmune Patient Safety as described in Section 6.8.  For guidelines for management of patients with infusion- related reactions refer to 
Appendix H . 
Administration Site Reactions:  
Adverse events  of administration site reactions are of special interest to the Sponsor.  These 
are defined, for the purpose of this protocol, as all AEs occurring as a result of the 
administration of the study treatment (vaccine and / or EP).  Guidelines for the grading and management of administration site reactions are outlined in Appendix I .  
6.12.5 Unanticipated (serious) adverse device effect  
Unanticipated adverse device effect means any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of patients.  
Per the defi nition above, an unanticipated adverse device effect is a type of SAE that requires 
expedited reporting on the part of the Sponsor.  As a reminder, all SAEs regardless of 
relationship to device, drug or procedure are to be reported to Sponsor by [CONTACT_475125] 24 hours.  Sponsor will assess each device related SAE to determine if anticipated based on prior identification within the investigational plan.  
6.13 Study governance and oversight  
The safety of all MedImmune clinical studies is closely mon itored on an ongoing basis by 
[CONTACT_475126].  Issues identified will be addressed; for instance this could involve amendments to the study protocol and letters to investigators.

 Durvalumab  
Durvalumab (also known as MEDI4736) is a human IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody 
directed against human PD -L1.  Durvalumab selectively binds human PD-L1 with high 
affinity an d blocks its ability to bind to PD-1 and CD80.  The fragment crystallizable domain 
of durvalumab contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that reduces binding to the complement component C1q and the Fcγ receptors responsibl e for 
mediating antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ( Oganesyan et al 2008).  
Durvalumab will be supplied by [CONTACT_475127] a 500 mg vial solution for infusion after dilution.  The solution contains 50 mg/mL durvalumab, 26 mM  histidine /

8.4.1 Primary endpoints  
The co -primary endpoints are the assessment of saf ety (including AEs, SAEs, laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, ECG, performance status assessments, physical examinations and 
concomitant medications) and ORR by [CONTACT_44993] 1.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events  
Adverse event data will be summarized by [CONTACT_475131].  Adverse 
events (both in terms of MedDRA preferred terms and CTCAE grade) will be listed 
individually by [CONTACT_4676].   
Any AE occurring before treatment with IP will be included in the data listings but will not be 
included in the summary tables of AEs.  Any AE occurring within 90 days of discontinuation 
of IP may be included in the AE summaries, but the majority of those summaries will omit those AEs observed after a patient has received further therapy for cancer.  Further details will 
be provided in the SAP.  Any events in this period that occur after a patient has received 
further therapy for cancer (following discontinuation of IP) will be flagged in the data listings. 
A separate data listing of AEs occurring more than 90 days after discontinuation of IP will be 
produced.  These events will not be included in AE summaries. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety assessments 
For the change from baseline summaries for vital signs, laboratory data, ECGs, performance  
status, and physical examination, the baseline value will be the latest result obtained prior to 
the start of study treatment.  Concomitant medication data will be listed only.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Investigator RECIST version 1.1- based assessments 
All RECIST assessments, whet her scheduled or unscheduled, will be included in the 
calculations.  This is also regardless of whether a patient discontinues study treatment or 
receives another anticancer therapy.  
At each visit, patients will be assigned a RECIST version  1.1 visit response of CR, PR, SD, or 
PD depending on the status of their disease compared with baseline and previous assessments 
by [CONTACT_737].  Note: at the discretion of the Sponsor, an independent central review of 
all scans used in the assessment of tumors by [CONTACT_44993] 1.1 and/or irRECIST may be conducted (refer to Section 5.3 for further details).  Baseline will be assessed within the 
28 days prior  to enrollment.  If a patient has had a tumor assessment that cannot be evaluated, 
then the patient will be assigned a visit response of not evaluable (unless there is evidence of 
progression in which case the response will be assigned as PD).  
Please refer  to Appendix F  for the definitions of CR, PR, SD, and PD.

Objective Response Rate (ORR)  
Objective response rate will be assessed as a se condary endpoint in the As -treated Population 
using RECIST version 1.1.  Objective response rate will be also assessed in the Response -evaluable and As -treated populations using irRECIST ( Appendix G ). 
Progression Free Survival (PFS)  
Progression free survival measures progression by [CONTACT_475108], nodal spread metastases, death from the cancer, or death from other causes.  Progression free survival will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_475109] [ADDRESS_608891]  version  1.1 ( Appendix F ). 
Progression free survival will be defined as the time from the date of start of IP treatment until 
the documentation of disease progression according to RECIST  version 1.[ADDRESS_608892] 
version 1.1 assessment prior to two missed visits.   
The PFS time will always be derived based on scan / assessment / death dates and not visit 
dates.  
RECIST version  1.1 assessment / scans contributing towards a particular visit may be 
performed on different dates.  The following rule will be applied:  
For investigator assessments, the date of progression will be determined based on the earliest of the RECIST version 1.1 assessment / scan dat es of the component that indicates 
progression.  
When censoring a patient for PFS, the patient will be censored at the latest of the dates contributing to a particular overall visit assessment.  
Note: For target lesions, only the latest scan date is recorded  out of all scans performed at that 
assessment for the target lesions, and similarly for non- target lesions, only the latest scan date 
is recorded out of all scans performed at that assessment for the non- target lesions.  
PFS will be assessed in the Respons e-evaluable and As -treated populations.

121 (159) Disease Control Rate (DCR)  
Disease control rate is defined as N (%) patients with CR, PR, or SD by [ADDRESS_608893] 16 weeks on study.  Disease control rate will be assessed in the 
Response- evaluable and As -treated populations.  
Overall Survival (OS)  
Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of start of IP treatment until death 
(+1 day) due to any cause.  Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be 
censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive.  Overall 
survival will be assessed in the Response- evaluable and As -treated populations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics and antibodies for durvalumab   
The actual sampling times will be used in the pharmacokinetic calculations.  Durvalumab 
concentration data and summary statistics will be tabulated.  Individual and mean serum durvalumab concentration- time profiles will be generated.   
Immunogenicity results will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_475132].  The immunogenicity titer will be reported for samples confirmed positive for the presence of ADA.

Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Life-threatening  
‘Life -threatening’ means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
event (AE) as it occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would 
result in the patient’s death.  ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a 
more severe form it might have caused death (e.g., hepatitis that resolved without hepatic 
failure).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_280843] a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal edema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144] / or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. 
Important medical event or medical intervention  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the def inition of serious.  
These should usually be considered as serious.  
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical judgment must be used.

• Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_475140] N-acetylcysteine  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
• Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc) or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]

• Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the patient actually received the 
suspect drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug?  
• Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from it s pharmacological 
properties?  
• De-challenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96699]?  
• No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_169978], other drugs, other host or environmental factors. 
• Re-challenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? MedImmune would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge.  
• Laboratory tests.  A specific la boratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship . 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:  
• Is this a recognized  feature of overdose of the drug?  
• Is there a known mechanism? 
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a ‘reasonable possibility’  of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a  causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evi dence) or arguments  to suggest a causal relationship. 
The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.  
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.

International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classifies biohazardous agents into 
three categories.  For transport purposes the classification of infectious substances according to Risk Groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations in the 46
th edition 
(2005).  Infectious substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B or Exempt.  There is no direct relationship between Risk Groups and categories A and B. 
Category A  Infectious Substances  are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life -threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healt hy humans or animals.  Category A pathogens are e.g., Ebola, Lassa fever 
virus:  
• Are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instruction 602. 
Category B Infectious Substances  are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A.  Category B pathogens are e.g., Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
Human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2.  They are assigned the following UN number and proper shippi[INVESTIGATOR_72919]:

Background and Rationale  
MedImmune intends to perform genetic research in the MEDI0457 and durvalumab clinical 
development programme to explore how genetic variations may affect the clinical parameters associated with MEDI0457 and durvalumab.  Collection of DNA samples from populations 
with well described clinical characteristics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, possibly, to genetically guided treatment strategies.  
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not 
only response to MEDI0457 and durvalumab but also susceptibility to recurrent / metastatic 
head and neck cancer associated with HPV -16 and / or HPV -[ADDRESS_608901] and store DNA for future exploratory research into 
genes / genetic variation that may influence response (i.e., distribution, safety, tolerability and 
efficacy) to recurrent / metastatic head and neck cancer associated with HPV -16 and / or 
HPV- 18.  
Genetic Research Plan and Procedures  
Selection of genetic research population  
Study selection record  
All patients will be asked to participate in this genetic research.  Participation is voluntary and if a patient declines to participate there will be no penalty or loss of benefit.  The patient will not be excluded from any aspect of the main study. 
Inclusion criteria  
For inclusion in this genetic research, patients must fulfill all of the inclusion criteria 
describ ed in the main body of the 
Clinical Study Protocol  and: 
• Provide informed consent for the genetic sampling and analyses.

140 ( 159) Exclusion criteria  
Exclusion from this genetic research may be for any of the exclusion criteria specified in the 
main study or any of t he following:  
• Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant  
• Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion in 120 days of genetic sample 
collection  
Discontinuation of patients from this genetic research  
Specific reasons for discontinuing a patient from this genetic research are:  
Withdrawal of consent for genetic research:  Patients may withdraw from this genetic research at any time, independent of any decision concerning participation in other aspects of the main study.  Voluntary discontinuation will not pre judice further treatment.  Procedures for 
discontinuation are outlined in Section 3.9 of the main 
Clinical Study Protocol . 
Collection of samples for genetic research  
The blood sample for genetic research will be obtained from the patients at Week  1, Week  8, 
Week 10 and Week  16 (Table 3).  Although genotype is a stable parameter, early sample 
collection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding patients who may withdraw 
due to an adverse event (AE), such patients would be important to include in any genetic 
analysis.  If for any reaso n the sample is not drawn at a scheduled visit at Week  1, Week  8, 
Week [ADDRESS_608902] laboratory.  No personal 
details identifying the individual will be available to any person (MedImmune employee or 
contract laboratory staff working w ith the DNA.)  
The samples and data for genetic analysis in this study will be single coded.  The link between 
the patient enrollment code and the DNA number will be maintained and stored in a secure 
environment, with restricted access within the Clinical G enotypi[INVESTIGATOR_475083] C  
Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
141 ( 159) Information Management System (LIMS) at MedImmune.  The link will be used to identify 
the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlation of genotypic results with clinical data, allow regulatory audit and to trace samp les for destruction in the case of withdrawal of 
consent. 
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements  
The principles for ethical and regulatory requirements for the study, including this genetics 
research component, are outlined in Section [ADDRESS_608903] party, unless 
required to do so by [CONTACT_2371].  
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to 
the identity of the patient.  In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might 
see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a patient.  For example, in the case of a medical emergency, a MedImmune Physician or an Investigator might know a patient’s 
identity and also have access to his or her genetic data.  Also Regulatory Authorities may 
require access to the relevant files, though the patient’s medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate.  
Data management  
Any genotype data generated in this study will be stored in the MedImmune genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_475084], or other appropriate secure system within MedImmune and / or third party contracted to work with MedImmune to analyze the samples.  
The results from this genetic research may be reported in the Clinical Study Report for the main study, or in a separate report as appropriate.  
Genotype data will be transferred to the clinical data base, and merged with the clinical data 
from the main study, prior to the statistical analysis and reporting of the study.  
Statistical methods and determination of sample size  
The number of patients that will agree to participate in the genetic research is unknown.  It is 
therefore not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal 
statistical evaluation or whether only descriptive statistics will be generated.  A SAP will be 
prepared where appropriate.

142 ( 159) Appendix D Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver 
Biochemistry and Evaluation of Hy’s Law 
Introduction 
During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry.  The Investigator is respons ible for determining whether a patient meets 
potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study. 
The Investigator participates, together with MedImmune clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to  agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  Hy’s Law criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in 
liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by [CONTACT_475141] (IP).  
The Investiga tor is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL / HL cases and for 
reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes. 
Definitions  
Potential Hy’s Law  
A PHL case is defined as a study patient with an increase in serum aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) together with  
total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ [ADDRESS_608904], irrespective of an inc rease in alkaline phosphatase (ALP),  at 
any point during the study following the start of study medication.  
Hy’s Law  
A HL case is defined as a study patient with an increase in serum AST or ALT ≥  [ADDRESS_608905] 
together with TBL ≥ [ADDRESS_608906] precede or be coi ncident with (i.e., on 
the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.

143 ( 159) Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases  
In order to identify cases of PHL, it is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination:  
• ALT ≥ [ADDRESS_608907]  
• AST ≥ [ADDRESS_608908]  
• TBL ≥ [ADDRESS_608909]  
When a patient meets any of the identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, the 
central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the Investigator (also sent to MedImmune 
representative).  
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the identificatio n criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:  
• Notify the MedImmune representative.  
• Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by [CONTACT_2237].  
• Complete the appropriate unscheduled laboratory CRF module(s) with the original local laboratory test result.  
When the identification criteria are met from central or local laboratory results the Investigator will without delay: 
• Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Definitions  within this 
Appendix for definition) by [CONTACT_48886] 
(including both central and local laboratory results).Definitions within this 
Appendix for defini tion) by [CONTACT_48886]

The Investigator will without delay review each new laboratory report and if the identification criteria are met will:  
• Notify the MedImmun e representative.  
• Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Definitions  within this 
Appendix for definition) by [CONTACT_48886].  Definitions within this Appendix for definition) by [CONTACT_48886].

144 ( 159) Follow -up 
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not Met  
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will: 
• Perform follow -up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance 
provided in the Clinical Study Protocol.  
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met  
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will: 
• Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any study visit prior to starting study 
treatment (See Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Crite ria are Met Before 
and After Starting Study Treatment ). 
• Notify the MedImmune representative who will then inform the central Study 
Team.  
The Study Physician contacts the investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study patients’ follow -up and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to 
this contact [CONTACT_48887]:  
• Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate  clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated.  
• Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as discussed with the Study Physician.  
• Complete the three Liver CRF Modules a s information becomes available.  
• If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the PHL case meets serious criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures.  
Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases  
The instructions in t his Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.  
No later than 3 weeks after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, the Study 
Physician  contacts the Investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by [CONTACT_33249].  
The MedImmune  Medical Science Director and Global Safety Physician will also be involved 
in this review together with other patient matter experts as appropriate .

Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
145 ( 159) According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Investigator will follow the 
instructions below. 
If there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is a n AE will be made and subsequently 
whether the AE meets the criteria for an SAE:  
• If the alternative explanation is not  an AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF.  
• If the alternative explanation is an AE / SAE, record the AE / SAE in the CRF 
accordingly and follow the AZ standard processes. 
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL elevations other than the IP:  
• Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to MedImmune standard processes.  
− The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious criteria apply.  
− As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment  of 
‘related’ should be assigned. 
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:  
• Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and causality assessment as per above.  
• Continue follow -up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary 
supplementary informati on is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to 
determine whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the review.  
Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and After Starting Study Treatment  
This section is applicable to patients with liver metastases who meet PHL criteria on study 
treatment having previously met PHL criteria at a study visit prior to starting study treatment.  
At the first on study treatment occurrence of PHL criteria being met  the Investigator will:

146 ( 159) • Determine if there has been a significant change in the patients’ condition# 
compared with the last visit where PHL criteria were met#  
− If there is no significant change no action is required  
− If there is a significant change notify the MedImmune representative, who will 
inform the central Study Team, then follow the subsequent process described in 
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met of this Appendix  
# A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the investigator, this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.  
Actions Required for Repeat Epi[INVESTIGATOR_475085]’s Law  
This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has already met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit.  
The requirement to conduct follow -up, review and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.   
The Investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence o f PHL criteria being 
met and answer the following question:  
• Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met found to be the disease under study e.g., chronic or progressing malignant disease, severe infection or liver diseas e, or did the patient meet PHL criteria prior to 
starting study treatment and at their first on study treatment visit as described in Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and After Starting Study Treatment ?  
If No: follow the process described in Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met of this Appendix 
If Yes:  
Determine if there has been a significant change in the patient’s condition
# compared with 
when PHL criteria were previously met  
• If there is no significant change no action is required.  
• If there is a significant change follow the process referred to in Appendix H . 
# A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinical ly relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of

using RECIST version 1.1 Criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors)  
DEFINITION OF MEASURABLE, NON- MEASURABLE, TARGET AND NON-
TARGET LESIONS  
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in the study.  
Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_12155] (by [CONTACT_44993] 1.1) lesion which has not been previously irradiated.  A tumor lesion in a pre viously 
irradiated field can be assessed as measurable disease provided the lesion has been deemed to demonstrate progression. 
Measurable disease  
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest dia meter [LD] to be recorded) as ≥  20 mm with conventional techniques 
(computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], x -ray) or as ≥  [ADDRESS_608910] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal 
fractions of centi meters).  
Non-measurable lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (LD <  20 mm with conventional 
techniques or <  [ADDRESS_608911] scan), are considered non- measurable disease.  B one 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural / pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis / pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]) and cystic lesions are all non- measurable.  
Target lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the LD) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]).  A sum of the LD for all target lesions  will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_475142].  
Non-target lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions  and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Non- target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the 
maximum nu mber per organ or total of all involved organs as well as non- measurable lesions.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up.

150 ( 159) Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment . 
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiate area might or might not be considered measurable.  Lesions progressing after previous irradiation are measurable; lesions not progressing after previous irradiation are not measurable.  
The s ame method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  Imaging- based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_475143] -tumor effect of treatment.  
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI   These techniques should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_608912], abdomen, and pelvis.  Head and 
neck tumors and those of extremities usually required specific protocols.  
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) -CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction 
CT portion of a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with 
RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET- CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with intravenous and oral 
contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can 
be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accuratel y measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an Investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
Ultrasound  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size  and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measure ments will be taken from one assessment to 
the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation 
by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be 
used instead of CT in select ed instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological

following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
Tumor markers  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and prostrate -specific antigen response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have 
been published [ JNCI  96:487- 488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461- 3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  
26:1148- 1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_608913]-line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534- 1535, 2000]. 
Cytology, Histology  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).

during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or SD is mandatory 
to differentiate between response or SD (an effusion may be a side effect of  the treatment) and 
progressive disease (PD).  
Fludeoxyglucose  (FDG) -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it 
is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT 
scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on 
the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
• No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of di sease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
• FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis o r scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positiv e CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and 
biopsy resolution / sensitivity.

153 ( 159) Evaluation of best overall response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the s tart of the treatment until 
disease progression / recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on 
the achievement of both measurement and confirm ation criteria.

Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having “symptomatic deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be inves tigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] / biopsy) to confirm the CR status. 
Confirmation  
The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating the response 
rate observed.  In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it should be made clear 
when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are not confirmed. 
To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3611] [ADDRESS_608914] met.  Longer intervals as determined by [CONTACT_475144] y also be 
appropriate.

154 ( 159) In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after 
study entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6- 8 weeks) that is defined in the 
study protocol  
Duration of overall response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for 
CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is 
objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurem ents recorded since 
the treatment started.  
Duration of stable disease  
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
The clinical relevance of the duration of SD varies for different tumor types and grades.  Therefore, it is highly recommended that the protocol specify the minimal time interval required between two measurements for determination of SD.  This ti me interval should take 
into account the expected clinical benefit that such a status may bring to the population under 
study.  
Response review  
For trials where the response rate is the primary endpoint it is strongly recommended that all 
responses be revi ewed by [CONTACT_13461](s) independent of the study at the study’s completion.  
Simultaneous review of the patients’ files and radiological images is the best approach.  
Reporting of results  
All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to tre atment, even if there are 
major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one 
of the following categories: 1) CR, 2) PR, 3) SD, 4) PD, 5) early death from malignant 
disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) ear ly death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not 
assessable, insufficient data).  
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria should be included in the main analysis of the response rate.  Patients in response categories 4 -9 should be considered  as failing to 
respond to treatment (disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug 
administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise 
definitions for categories 4- [ADDRESS_608915] been identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons,

subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, 
and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly reported.   
The 95% confidence intervals should be provided.

a Common Language for Tumor Response to Immunotherapy: Immune -Related Response 
Criteria Using Unidimensional Measurements.  Clin Cancer Res; 19(14) July 15, 2013 
For the immune -response response criteria (irRC), only index and measurable new lesions are 
taken into account (in contrast to conventional World Health Organization [ WHO] criteria, 
which do not require the measurement of new lesions, nor do they include new lesion 
measurements in the characterization of evolving tumor burden).  
The longest diamet er of each target lesion will be recorded.  Measurable lesions will be 
defined as ≥  [ADDRESS_608916] as opposed to ≥5 x 5 mm2 in WHO / 
irRC.   
For unidimensional measurements, the cut -off values by [CONTACT_393] (≥  20% increase from the 
nadir for progression, ≥  30% decrease from baseline for partial response, and disappearance of 
lesions for complete remission) will be used.

157 ( 159) Appendix  H Durvalumab Dose Modification for Toxicity Management   
Guidelines for the management of immune -mediated reactions, infusion- related reactions, and 
non-immune -mediated reactions for durvalumab monotherapy are provided in the Dosing 
Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines. The most current version of t hese 
guidelines is an annex to this protocol and is also maintained within the Site Master File.  
Patients should be thoroughly evaluated, and appropriate efforts should be made to rule out 
neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic cause s of the immune -mediated AE. 
Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an immune -mediated AE diagnosis. In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, 
events should be considered potentially immune rel ated.  
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which durvalumab should be permanently discontinued (see Section 6.12.1 of this protocol and the Dosing Modifica tion and Toxicity 
Management Guidelines).  
Following the first dose of durvalumab subsequent administration of durvalumab can be modified based on toxicities observed as described in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines. These guidelines have been prepared by [CONTACT_475145]/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities. 
These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related to durvalumab monotherapy regimen by [CONTACT_72943].  
Dose reductions are not permitted. In case of doubt, the Investigator should consult with the Study Physician.

Duration  1 year    
 
3. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
There is profound heterogeneity  of subjects in clinical studies  of addictions, with patients being 
diagnosed by [CONTACT_589856].  As a result, utilizing  current DSM addictions 
classification lead s to problems with signal detection and hamper the progress of the 
development of new drugs and treatments for substance use disorders  (SUDs) . Getting beyond 
the DSM -5 based definitions is necessary to “fingerprint” addiction phenotypes  and 
endophenotypes , using machine- learning analyses of big data.  A d etailed in- depth assessment 
of addiction phenotypes (deep phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) may also include neuroimaging. .   
 
In an  effort to develop a “fingerprint” for addiction phenotypes, NIDA established a Workgroup to 
develop a phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589828] -rated psychometric scales, supplemented by 
[CONTACT_589857] . The final phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589829] - consultants  group and the NIDA  workgroup, and as such, the 
battery  requires feasibility and validation study to finalize its content . The NIDA Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589830]  (PhAB) covers six neurofunctional addiction domains :  M etacognition,  
Interoception,  Cognition/Executive Function, Reward/Incentive Salience, Emotion/Negative 
Emotionality , and Sleep/Circadian Rhythm.  The PhAB is m eant to be administered during a 
Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_488869] - an extension of a screening visit in any clinical trial addictions protocol.   In 
addition to the PhAB, the group also developed an ancillary  set of measures  to be administered 
in conjunction with the Ph AB in any addictions clinical  trial during the Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_488869] .  The 
Platform Instrument s include structured interviews, diagnostic measures (e.g., MINI), self report 
scales of symptom severity (e.g., ASRS -ADHD, VAS -Pain), trauma history ( THQ ), computer -
administered measures of intelligence (e.g., Shipley), and substance use measures (FTND, 
Timeline Follow -back), etc.  Clinical trial investigators would administer these scales and 
behavioral tasks   in addition to protocol nonspecific assessments (e.g., d emographics) and 
medical evaluations (e.g, medical history and physical exams, genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and labs)  which 
could be done at Screening.   
NIDA Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589821] 4, Date 06.12.[ADDRESS_777001] is to validate preliminary findings from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_589831] a streamlined, validated deep phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589832]. Specific aims to achieve this goal include:  
1. To finalize the PhAB battery content by [CONTACT_589855], in order to further refine the assessment battery;  
2. To confirm percentages of participants that can complete the non- MRI portion of the protocol 
within two study visits;  
3. To assess whether PhAB battery profiles and performance measures vary in meaningful 
ways across substance use conditions, taking into account critical variables such as 
concomitant substance use, and  
psychosocial factors (e.g., trauma, depression, anxiety, etc); and  
4. To compare effective (directional) brain connectivity (via resting state fMRI and structural 
scans) between OUD, other relevant populations, and control participants and the relationship 
between effective brain connectivity and behavioral assessments from the PhAB   
  
5. STUDY DESIGN  
 
The study utilizes a four -group cross  sectional cohort design.  A total of 400 participants (across 
4 cohorts) are targeted to complete the study ) to include:  Healthy Controls (n= 100), individuals 
with CocUD (n=50), individuals with OUD (n=200), and individuals wit h marijuana use disorder  
(n=50). The study is anticipated to take [ADDRESS_777002] meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the

7.[ADDRESS_777005] Recruitment and Consenting   
 
Subjects will be recruited from participants included in the CARI screening repository (VCU 
IRB# HM20000294, Keyser -Marcus (PI))  and from local advertising.  Individuals who have 
previously completed the CARI universal screening protocol (through HM20000294) and are 
determined to be eligible for an on- site screening visit, will be contact[CONTACT_589858].  Interested individuals will be scheduled for an on- site screening visit.  
 Individuals who present for the screening visit will undergo the informed consent process.  The 
consent procedure fully apprises individuals of rights and responsibilities of study participants.  Consent is conducted by [CONTACT_589859] a private office. During the consenting process, 
potential participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions throughout and have all of 
their questions answered prior to making a decision regarding whether or not to participate.  All 
consent and study procedures and materials will be approved by [CONTACT_589860].  All subjects will 
provide informed written consent prior to any data collection. During the informed consent 
process it will be made clear to all subjects that this is not a treatment study.  A community 
resource brochure will be offered  to all study participants,  regardless of group assignment.  The 
resource brochure includes information on substance abuse treatment  providers in the 
Richmond area .  
NIDA Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589821] 4, Date 06.12.[ADDRESS_777006] during the same visit as the consent/enrollment into 
the study.  It is estimate d to take between 60 and 90 minutes  for subjects to complete screening 
procedures.   
 
Screening assessment used to determine study eligibility will i nclude (may not in that 
particular order as in below) :  
A Demographics Questionnaire will be used to assess standard sociodemographic 
information, including age, racial/ethnic background, sex, educational attainment, employment 
status, occupation, and mari tal status.  
 
Participant Locator Form  The Participant Locator form collects information (e.g., name, 
address, telephone number, email) for the participant and phone numbers for up to three other 
people whom the participant states are familiar with his or her whereabouts and who might 
assist w ith contact [CONTACT_589861].  
 
The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview  V 7.0.2  (MINI ) (Sheehan et al, 1998) will 
be used to collect diagnostic information used to make eligibility determinations. DSM -5 
diagnoses (including Cocaine Use Disorder and Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2442]) will be ascertained for all subjects. Interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_589862].  
 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS).   (Posner et al., 2009) is an interview 
measure used to  assess suicidal ideation and behavior. The Baseline version is used during 
screening and collects information related to lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior. The Since 
Last Visit  version assesses suicidal ideation and behavior in the time since the last patient visit, 
and will be used at the subsequent study visit.  
 
The CARI Medical Survey  will be used to collect information regarding medical history on all 
potential subjects, and the C oncomitant Medications  form will be used to collect information 
regarding current over -the-counter and prescription medications used by [CONTACT_42148] . 
Vital signs  to be assessed include oral temperature, sitting blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], and weight. Urine specimens will be collected for pregnancy testing (females only) , as well 
as urine drug screen  for cocaine (benzoylecgonine), opi[INVESTIGATOR_414099], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
amphetamine, methamphetamine, and THC.  Breath alcohol and carbon monoxide (for recent 
tobacco use) levels will also be obtained.  
 
Upon completion of the screening assessments listed above, individuals who screen as 
ineligible will be compensated for their time and effort and informed that they are ineligible to participate in the study.  Individuals who are deemed eligible for the study will go on to complete 
a portion of the Platform Battery (listed below) assessments during this visit, if time permits.  If 
the participant has to leave prior to completing these assessments, they will be completed at the 
Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589838].   
 
 
 
MRI Eligibility Screening  
NIDA Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589821] 4, Date 06.12.19 
 12 Individuals in the Healthy Control and Opi[INVESTIGATOR_589839].  The MRI screening consists of the following:  
 
Medical and Laboratory Evaluation, which will include a physical examination (including 
neurological  exam and medical history), MRI safety screening, and a blood draw for complete 
blood count (CBC).  
 
Mock MRI scanning session: Healthy control and OUD subjects who are deemed eligible for MRI scanning, based on results of the physical exam and MRI screeni ng checklist, will also 
complete a mock MRI scanning session. During the mock session, participants are allowed to practice tasks in a MRI Simulation Device (mock MRI machine). During the computer demonstration prior to the simulator sessions, subjects are allowed up to 10 min of practice 
(with interaction permitted with the research assistant), until it is clear that the procedures are understood and that the majority of the practice responses are correct. During simulator 
sessions, tasks are projected by [CONTACT_589863] a screen that the subject views using 
mirror- prism glasses. The subject listens to a recording of MRI sounds during the simulator 
sessions.   Participants will also complete the Edinburgh Handedness inventory in order to 
determine their dominant hand across a number of tasks.  Self report of recent drug use will also be collected.  Participants will also complete the 24- hour Survey at both the  mock MRI 
scan visit and the MRI scan visit, in order to document consumption of caffeinated beverages, alcohol and tobacco use in the past [ADDRESS_777007] positive for opi[INVESTIGATOR_589840]/or MRI 
visit(s). The Opi[INVESTIGATOR_589837].  Finally, the Resting State Questionnaire will be administered following the MRI scan.   
  
Upon completion of the screening visit, CARI research staff will inform participants of their 
eligibility to complete the study. Eligible participants are then scheduled to return to the clinic to complete the study assessment visit. Individuals who are not eligible will be notified of thei r 
ineligibility, compensated $30 (non MRI candidates) or up to $70 ($70 for MRI candidates who complete the mock scanning session, or $50 for MRI candidates who do not complete the MRI 
scanning session), and thanked for their time.  
 
Note :  Individuals who have already completed the Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589841], and 
have been recontact[CONTACT_589864] a MRI screening visit, which will consist of the same MRI screening procedures listed 
above.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_777008] of the the remaining measures included in 
the Platform Instrument Battery , and all of the measures included in the Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589842].  It 
is estimated to take approximately 3.5 - 4 hours to complete both (with scheduled rest breaks 
included).  Upon arrival to the clinic, participants will first complete biological measures, which 
includes vital signs (oral temper ature, sitting blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and 
weight), urine and breath samples.  Urine specimens will be collected for pregnancy testing 
(females only), and urine drug screen for cocaine (benzoylecgonine), opi[INVESTIGATOR_414099], 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], amphetamine, methamphetamine, and THC.  Breath alcohol and carbon 
monoxide (for recent tobacco use) levels will also be obtained.

7.4.1  Assessment Measures  
 
Platform Instrument Measures.  Platform instruments will not be administered in the fixed 
sequence as in below. Efforts will be made to administer as many of the Platform Instruments 
marked with an asterisk  (*) at the time of the Screening Visit (as time permits) . Otherwise, they 
will be  administered during the Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589843] .   
 
* Computerized Shipley -2. Brief, but robust measure of cognitive functioning and impairment 
that assesses both crystallized and fluid cognitive ability (Shipley, Gruber, Martin, and Klein, 2009). Estimated time to complete [ADDRESS_777009] reliability correlations (.74 to .94) 
across a 1 -2 week delay, and good internal consistency, discriminative validity, and strong 
concurrent validity with WAIS -III, PIQ, and VIQ ( with correlations ranging from .62- .87).   
 
* Adult Self -Report Symptom (ASRA) Checklist (ADHD) . A brief self -administered inventory 
consisting of 18 questions which aids in assessing symptoms of ADHD/ADD. Estimated time to complete is 1- 5 minutes. It has demonstrated high rates of internal consistency for both self -
report and rater -administered versions (Cronbach’s alpha 0.88, 0.89, respectively) and high 
concurrent validity with the rater administered ADHD RS (Adler, Spencer, et al, 2006) 
 
* Recent Life Events Questionnaire (Adults) . (Brugha, Bebington, et al, 1985), Is a 21 -item self -
administered scale used to assess recent (past 12 months) life events, as well as their current 
impact on the respondent. 
 
* Family Tree Questionnaire (FTQ) for Substance Use. A self -report family history measure that 
assists in identifying of first - and second- degree relatives with alcohol and other substance use -
related problems (Mann, Sobell, Sobell, & Sobell, 1985).  Reliability studies have demonstrated good test -retest reliability, and validity studies have shown criterion and concurrent validity of 
the instrument.  
 
* Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ).   A 24-item self report measure of physical and sexual 
abuse (ever in lifetime), which includes items related to crime -related events and general 
disaster/trauma.  Respondents are asked to provide the frequency of the event and their age at 
the time of the event. The THQ has been found to be psychometrically sound with regard to 
both reliability and validity (Hooper, Stockton, Krupnick, & Green, 2011)  
 
* Relationship Scale Questionnaire (RSQ)  A 30-item self -report questionnaire that assesses 
attachment style. Subjects rate on a 5 point scale, the extent to which each statement describes 
them in close relationships from “Not at all like me” to “Very much like me”. (Griffin and 
Bartholomew, 1994).  Previous research has suggested that the RSQ demonstrates good test -
retest reliability and internal consistency (Guédeney,  Fermanian, & Bifulco 2010).  
 
* Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS- pain) . 100mm visual analog scale used to obtain patient 
rating for current magnitude of pain experienced, with endpoints defining extreme limits such as ‘no pain at all’ and ‘pain as bad as it could be’ (Wewers & Lowe, 1990)  
 
Timeline Follow Back for Drug, Alcohol, Tobacco use  (Sobell and Sobell, 1996).  Structured 
interview that queries quantity of daily drug,alcohol and tobacco use over a specified time 
period. Using a calendar, respondents provide retrospective estimates of their tobacco, alcohol 
NIDA Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589821] 4, Date 06.12.19 
 14 and/or drug use.  This method has demonstrated solid psychometric properties  across a variety 
of populations ( Robinson, Sobell, Sobell, & Leo, 2014).  
 
Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND)  (Heatherton et al, 1991; available in the 
Millisecond Test Library ). A widely used 6- item self-report questionnaire designed to measure 
nicotine dependence,  The items are summed to yield a total score of 0 -10, with higher scores 
indicating greater nicotine dependence.    
 
Brief Substance Craving Scale (BSCS; available in the Millisecond Test Library ). The BSCS is a 
16 item, self -report instrument assesses  craving  intensity and frequency of craving  for cocaine 
and other substances of abuse over a 24-hour period.   Items are rated on a five-p oint Likert -
type scale (Somoza, Dyrenforth, Goldsmith, Mezinskis, & Cohen, 1995).  
 
PTSD Checklist for DSM5 . (PCL5 ; available in the Millisecond Test Library ) A 20-item 
questionnaire based on DSM 5 criteria for PTSD ,with each item being assigned a severity score 
of 0-4 , yielding  a total symptom severity score ranging from  0- 80  The PCL5 has been shown to 
exhibit strong internal consistency (α = .94), and test-retest reliability (r = .82), as well as  
convergent and discriminant validity (Blevins, Weathers, Davis, Witte, & Domino, 2015).  
WHO QOL  Bref. (available in the Millisecond Test Library).  A 26-item questionnaire assessing 
quality of life in 4 domains: physical, psychological, social and environmental  (WHOQOL Group, 
1998). Reliability and validity data indicate that the WHOQOL- BREF has good to excellent 
internal consistency, item –total correlations , and discriminant validity and construct validity 
(Skevington, Lotfy, & O’Connell, 2004)  
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ( PANAS- 20; available in the Millisecond Test Library). A 
20-item measure assessing positive and negative affect, on a scale from 1 to 5  (Watson et 
al.1988).  Reliability and validity reported by [CONTACT_213303] (1988) was moderately good, with the

5-Trial Adjusting Delay Discounting task  (available in the Millisecond Test Library ; Koffarnus & 
Bickel, 2014). A brief task designed to obtain a subject ’s discount rate in less than one minute.  
Based on the premise that individuals tend to value rewards less as the amount of time increases until those rewards would be received. 
 
Emotional Go/Nogo Task (Tottenham, Hare  & Casey, 2011; will be available in the Millisecond 
Test Library ).  Task designed to assess cognitive control in the context of emotional information

 Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS)  (available in the Millisecond Test Library). A  15-item self report
 
measure of emotional distress tolerance.  Items are loaded across  4 factors:  tolerance, 
absorption, appraisal, regulation (Simons  & Gaher, 2005)  
 
PROMIS - Depression scale.  A brief ( 4-item) self-report measure which assesses four domains 
of depression: negative mood, views of self, social cognition, and decreased positive affect and engagement.  With regard to psychometric characteristics, Choi and colleagues (2010), found 
that the short form  scores were highly correlated with the longer PROMIS measures.  
 
PROMIS - Anxiety .  A brief (4-item) self-report measure which assesses anxiety symptoms (e.g., 
hyperarousal) , experienced in the past 7 days. .  Subjects rate the frequency of experiencing

questionnaire assessing sleep habits, including disruptions in sleep and influence of sleep on daily functioning during the past week . (Bu ysse et al., 1989).  
Concomitant Medication(s)  
All concomitant medications taken during the trial must be recorded with indication, daily dose, 
and start and stop dates of administration. Medications taken within [ADDRESS_777013] complete biological measures, which includes vital 
signs (oral temperature, sitting blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and weight), urine and 
breath samples.  Immedi ately prior to MRI scanning, urine from each participant  is screened for 
amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA (ecstasy), opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (methadone,  buprenorphine, morphine, codeine, heroin, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, 
levorphanol, oxycodone, and oxymorphone), phencyclidine,  propoxyphene, tricyclic 
antidepressants, and THC.  Breath alcohol and carbon monoxide (for recent tobacco use) levels 
will also be  obtained.  Self report of recent drug use will also be collected.  Particip ants will also 
complete the 24- hour Survey at both the mock MRI  scan visit and the MRI scan visit, in order to 
document consumption of caffeinated beverages, alcohol and tobacco use in the past 
24 hours.  The appropriate Drug Intoxication Scale(s) (cocaine/opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/marijuana) will also be 
completed with individuals who test positive for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], cocaine, and/or marijuana during the mock scan and/or MRI visit(s). The Opi[INVESTIGATOR_589846].  Finally, the Resting State  Questionnaire will be administered following 
the MRI scan.   
 
As an additional measure of phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589847], a subset 
of participants (OUD primary (n =50),  and HC (n=50)), will undergo an MRI scan consisting of a 
resting state fMRI and structural scans. Brain connectivity measures will be determined 
using  functional and effective connectivity analyses.  
 
The scan session will last  approximately  80 minutes 
from the time of successful position 
of while  the participant’s head is in the scanner bore , including time for  individual scan setups . 
The session consists of  each of the following scans:  1) Localizer, 2) resting- state  fMRI  scan, 
during which the participant is  asked simply to look at  a crosshair, 3) T2 FLAIR  scan for 
incidental pathology, 4) Structural T1 -weighted MP -RAGE  scan for calculation of brain 
volumes  and co- localization of brain signal across different participants, 5) Drug- word Stroop 
task (s ee description below), 6)  Two runs of the XY -GoNoGo task (see description below), 7) 
PRESS Spectroscopy sequence to assess concentrations of glutamate, choline, creatine, N -
acetyleaspartate and other metabolites in the anterior cingulate cortex  , 8) and Mega -PRESS 
spectroscopy sequence to assess concentrations of GABA  in the anterior  cingulate cortex.  MR 
spectroscopy will be performed on the ACC region and will use Point -Resolved Spectroscopic 
Sequence (PRESS).  The MRS scan is approximately 4.5 mins.  MRS  analysis for PRESS 
spectra will be performed by [CONTACT_589867]- based Magnetic R esonance User Interface 
(jMRUI) .  Specialized MRS of GABA and other  metabolites will be performed using a Mescher -
Garwood PRESS  (MEGA -PRESS) sequence.  The total time for this sequence is approximately 
[ADDRESS_777014] will experience nothing different compared to other MRI scans in the study.   Prior to each fMRI run, two EPI [INVESTIGATOR_589848] -encode directions (less than 60 s duration). From 
this scan pair, susceptibility -induced off -resonance field correction is estimated using  the 
method implemented in FSL "topup" software. In addition, peripheral pulse rate (using MRI 
compatible pulse oximeter)  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (using standard MRI respi[INVESTIGATOR_589849]) will 
be recorded during the fMRI scans for removing artifactual physiological signals 
using  
the “retroicor”  software.  
 
NIDA Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589821] 4, Date 06.12.[ADDRESS_777015] sees  a sequence of 
either the letter X or the letter Y presented in the middle of the screen once per second (i.e. 1 s 
trial; stimulus duration =  400 to 600 ms).  The remaining time of each one- second trial is 
composed of blank screen).  The s ubject is instructed to respond to each letter if it is different 
than (i.e. alternates with) the previous letter.  Periodically, the subject will see a second X or a 
second Y  presented in a row, and must  withhold his or her response.  The scan task will b e 
performed in two fMRI  runs (5 minutes each).  During task performance, an indicator LED light 
flashes in the scanner control room with each button press, thereby [CONTACT_589868] -time.  
  Drug Word Stro op Task  Participants see opi[INVESTIGATOR_589850] (OWs) and neutral words (NWs) within 
four alternated [ADDRESS_777016] color. For each participant, the mean reaction times (RTs) during the OW blocks and during the  NW blocks are computed. The effect of opi[INVESTIGATOR_589851] (ΔRT) are measured by [CONTACT_589869] t-response trials in the 
OW blocks minus the mean RT during all the correct -response trials in the NW blocks, i.e., ΔRT 
= RT (OW) minus  RT (NW). ΔRT is treated as the behavioral measure of attentional bias.

NIDA Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589821] 4, Date 06.12.[ADDRESS_777018] protection  
 
Subjects might experience psychological distress due to assessment procedures.  It is not 
anticipated that serious psychiatric problems (including suicidality) will develop while participating in the study. If such an event occurs (whether or not it 
is thought to be study -related), the study team is experienced in handling these events and will 
follow clinic guidelines and immediately contact [CONTACT_589872]/or PI [INVESTIGATOR_331010].  The participant will be referred for appropriate medic al or psychiatric care as 
needed.   It is more likely that during the clinic visits , participants may  
experience some degree of emotional discomfort or fatigue due to the screening and/or 
assessment procedures. However, the  use of these procedures has not been shown to be 
harmful to psychiatric/substance abusing patients. In an effort to minimize the risk of distress 
and/or fatigue experienced by  [CONTACT_4317], breaks will be given at regular intervals and as 
needed, and participants will be informed that they have the right to refuse to answer questions that make them uncomfortable. Additionally, research personnel are trained to assess for level 
of distress and will  be attentive to the participant’s needs.  
 
Confidentiality of patient records is maintained by [CONTACT_589873]. Research data are kept in a  
locked filing cabinet; signed consent forms and subject ID keys are kept in a separate  
location in a locked cabinet.   
 
 9.2 Adverse event monitoring and reporting  
 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant  
that may or may not have a causal relationship with study participation. Any mention of an 
untoward event will  trigger an entry onto the AE log. All adverse events (AEs) occurring during 
the course of the study will be collected, documented, and reported to the PI. The occurrence of 
AEs will be assessed at baseline.  Due to the nature of the current study, it is anticipated that a 
low number of study -related adverse events will occur. However, potential adverse events  may 
include: psychological distress due to assessment procedures . Relapse to substances requiring  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], drug overdose,  and suicidality may also occur .  A summary of AE s will be 
provided to the VCU IRB at the time of protocol continuing review , and will also be provided to 
NIDA  Program Officer ([CONTACT_589876]) and Science Officer ([CONTACT_589877]) .   
 
9.3 Serious adverse event monitoring and reporting  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any event that is fatal or life threatening, that is permanently disabling, requires or extends hospi[INVESTIGATOR_264473], is a congenital  
anomaly, or requires intervention to prevent any of the above. This could incl ude 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_589853].  
 
NIDA Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_589821] 4, Date 06.12.19 
 21 AE’s deemed to be serious (SAEs), as defined by [CONTACT_1622], will be systematically evaluated at 
each clinic visit. Study -related SAEs, will be reported to the VCU IRB, and the NIDA Program 
Office r within 24- 48 hours. A full written report to all institutions will follow as soon as possible 
but in no more than three days.  The written report will be in the format required by [CONTACT_589874], description of the SAE, severity 
rating (Grade 1 to 4), assessment of cause, whether the SAE indicates an increased risk for current or future subjects, and whether changes to the informed consent form will be necessary.   
  
9.4 Criteria  for Participant  Discontinuation from the Study  
 
The reasons for discontinuation from the study may include:  inability to comply with study 
procedures , change in study eligibility, or exhibiting potential harm to self or others.  Participants  
must continue to meet inclusion criteria in order to remain in the protocol.  If suicidal ideation is 
identified in any subjects while actively enrolled in the study, the subject will be withdrawn from 
the study. The study physician will be contact[CONTACT_589875]. If the 
participant expresses having a plan, the subject will not be left alone until a study physician has 
met with him/her. A trained study staff will remain with the subject until a study physician meets 
with him/her or until the subject has been seen by a study psychiatrist for an emergency psychiatric consultation. A physician will be available at all times to assess the situation. If the  
study physician determines that the subject’s suicidal risks are high, he/she will develop a plan 
for saf ety will the subject, including but not limited to: transferring the patient to the psychiatric 
unit of the VCU medical center.  
 In the event that a patient either withdraws from the study or the investigator decides to 
discontinue a patient due to SAE, the patient will have appropriate follow -up monitoring. 
Monitoring will continue until the problem requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104607], is clearly unrelated to study, or results in death.  
 
10.  Institutional  Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee(IEC)  
 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have IRB approval of the study protocol, protocol 
amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, eg, advertisements, if applicable, fr om the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the 
Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/IEC approvals should be forwarded to NIDA Science Officer ([CONTACT_589878]).

Study Drug :  Emapalumab, previously referred to as NI-0501 , is a fully human 
IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against human IFNγ . 
Dosing Regimen , Frequency  
of Administration  & 
Treatment Duration:  
  Emapalumab  will be administered at the initial  dose of 6 mg/kg  by 
[CONTACT_104482] . 
 Emapalumab  treatment will be continued at the dose of 3 mg/kg , 
every 3 days until SD15, and then twice -a-week  for additional 2 
weeks , i.e. until SD28 .  
 Treatment may be shortened upon achievement of complete 
clinical response (i.e. MAS remission),  however at least two 
infusions of emapalumab  at the dose of 3 mg/kg have to be 
administered (i.e. after SD6) .  
 In the absence of a trend of improvement in key MAS parameters 
(including , but not limited to  ferritin, LDH, AST/ALT and PLT 
count) suggestive of lack of response, the emapalumab regimen 
may be adapted (the frequency between infusions shortened , the 
dose increased  or the treatment prolonged beyond 4 weeks ) upon 
assessment of a favorable benefit/risk profile.  
Background Therapy & 
Concomitant Medication:   Emapalumab  will be administered on a background of at least 2 
mg/kg /day of PDN equivalent ( or at least  60 mg/day in patients of 
30 kg or more) , which can be tapered during the treatment 
depending on patient conditions . Cyclosporine A (CsA) may be 
continued if started at least 3 days prior to initiation of 
emapalumab treatment . CsA dose adjustments are allowed in order 
to maintain therapeutic levels. CsA can be withdrawn at any time 
during the study, upon judgment of the Investigator. CsA should 
not be introduced once emapalumab treatment has started.  
 Patients must  receive prophylactic treatment for Herpes Zoster  
infections starting preferably the day before  (and in any case prior 
to initiation of emapalumab  treatment ), and treatment must 
continue until serum emapalumab  levels are no longer detectable . 
 If being administered and if started (at any dose) at least 3 days 
before initiation of emapalumab treatment , anakinra may be 
continued  at a max imum dose of 4mg/kg . 
 Tocilizumab, canakinumab or TNF inhibitors  as sJIA /AOSD  
treatment  must be discontinued at  the latest before the first 
emapalumab  infusion .  
 Methotrexate may be continued if ongoing as treatment for the 
underlying disease .   
 In the case of an acute inflammatory flare of the underlying 
sJIA/AOSD  during treatment with emapalumab , anakinra may be 
introduced at a dose of 1 to 4 mg/kg (max. daily dose 100 mg). 
Such epi[INVESTIGATOR_777452] (excluding the tre ating physician , if applicable) , in order to 
ascertain their nature  (i.e. sJIA/AOSD versus MAS  flare). 
 If the patient is receiving  intrathecal  therapy (e.g.  methotrexate and 
glucocorticoids ) at the time of emapalumab  treatment initiation, 
this treatment will be continued until clinically indicated .  
 Vaccination with a live or attenuated -live (including BCG)  vaccine 
must  be avoided during the whole study  until serum  emapalumab

protocol. 
 End of the study is defined as last patient last visit . 
 All patients who have received at least one dose of emapalumab  
will be asked to enter a long-term follow -up study .  
Study Scientific Oversight/ 
Study Safety Monitoring :   A Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) composed of international 
experts in pediatric rheumatology as well as in HLH  has been 
involved in the preparation of study design and will continue to 
play an advisory role throughout the course of the study , to support 
the iDMC in the study oversight, and the S ponsor in the 
interpretation of the study results . 
 An independent  Data Monitoring Committee ( iDMC) composed of 
relevant experts (pediatric rheumatologist , hemato -oncol ogist with 
experience in HLH, pediatric immun e deficiency/infectious disease 
specialist, bio-statistician and a specialist in ethics) will oversee the 
safety management of the study , reviewing all data generated  on an 
ongoing basis  with the aim to ensure that patients are not exposed 
to unnecessary risks . 
Study Endpoints : Pharmacokinetics  and Pharmacodynamics   
 PK profile of emapalumab .  
 Levels of circulating free IFN at pre -dose, and total IFNγ (free 
IFNγ+bound to emapalumab ) after initiation of emapalumab . 
 Levels  of the main IFNγ -induced chemokines  (CXCL9, CXCL10).  
 Correlation between chemokine levels (CXCL9, CXCL10) and 
levels of free emapalumab , free IFNγ  (pre-dose) and total IFNγ

 Correlation of chemokine and total IFNγ  levels, and laboratory 
parameters of MAS severity, e.g. ferritin, platelet count, LFTs 
(exploratory analysis ). 
 Levels of other potential disease markers  (e.g. sCD25,  sCD163, IL -
10, IL-6, IL-18, TNF).  
 Levels (if any) of circulating antibodies against emapalumab  to 
determine immunogenicity (ADA ). 
In particular, based on:  
 levels of circulating emapalumab   
 levels of total IFNγ   
 levels of IFNγ –induced chemokines  (namely CXCL9  and 
CXCL10 ) 
a PK/PD modelling will be used to confirm that the proposed dose 
regimen is adequate in relation to the IFNγ  production in this patient 
population.  
 Safety  
The tolerability  and safety of emapalumab  treatment will be assessed 
as follows:  
 Incidence, severity, causality and outcomes of AEs (serious and 
non-serious), with particular attention being paid to infections . 
 Evolution of laboratory parameters, in particular CBC,  LFTs , 
inflammatory markers (ferritin and CRP)  and coagulation  
parameters.  
 Number of patients withdrawn from the study due to safety 
reasons.  
 Efficacy   
An assessment of emapalumab  efficacy in this patient population will 
be based on the following variables:  
 Number of patients achieving MAS remission by [CONTACT_10585] 8 after 
initiation of emapalumab  treatment.  
 Time to MAS remission . 
 Number of patients for whom at any time during the study  
glucocorticoids can be tapered i) to the same  (or lower)  dose being 
administered before the occurrence of MAS  (in those patients who 
are already treated for the underlying condition ) or ii) by 50% (or 
less) of the dose administered at emapalumab  treatment start (in 
those patients who present with MAS at disease  onset).   
 Time to glucocorticoids tapering (as above described).  
 Survival time.  
 Number of patients withdrawn from the study due to lack of 
efficacy.  
Statistical Analysis:   All study variables  are considered to be exploratory in this study, 
and no hierarchy of endpoints has been specified, as the objective 
of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_777453] . 
Statistical methods will therefore focus on summarizing the data 
collected using descriptive statistics  and on appropriate graphical

 For binary endpoints ( MAS remission by [CONTACT_10585] 8 , number of 
patients who taper glucocorticoids , number of patients who 
discontinu e due to lack of efficacy) , 95% confidence intervals will 
be calculated  for proportions.  
 For time to event endpoints (time to MAS remission, time to 
achievement of glucocorticoids tapering and time to death) , 
Kaplan -Meier c urves will be calculated and summary statistics, 
such as medians, proportions event -free at various time points will 
be calculated and presented , and 95% confidence intervals 
calculated where possible .   
 Data relating to safety will be listed and summarised using 
descriptive statistics .

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1 EMAPALUMAB 
1.1.1 Description and mode of action 
Emapalumab is a fully hum
an IgG1 anti-interferon gamma (IFNγ)  monoclonal antibody (mAb) which 
binds and neutralizes IFNγ. emapalumab binds to soluble and receptor (IFNγR1)-bound forms of 
IFNγ.  
Since emapalumab is a human IgG1, it retains the characteristics of this immunoglobulin isotype.  After binding to its receptor, IFNγ acts to produce a variety of physiological and cellular responses. 
Numerous studies ov er 
 the last [ADDRESS_1067771] associated IFN  with the pathogenesis and the 
maintenance of inflammatory diseases (Billiau A 1996, Schoenborn JR 2007, Zhang SY 2008) , and  
most recently, in the pathogenesis of HLH.  
1.1.2  Preclinical Data  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-clinical Pharmacology 
Emapalumab has shown simil ar
 binding affinity and blocking activity f or IFNγ from non-human 
species, including Rhesus and Cynomolgus monkeys, but not from dogs, cats, pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], rabbits, rats or 
mice.  
Due to emapalumab capacity to bind free and IFNγR1-bound IFNγ, studies were performed to 
investigate the potential of emapalumab to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activities, in the presence of target. A lack of ADCC 
activity was demonstrated and no induction of CDC activity was observed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Toxicology 
Binding and functi o
nal data demonstrated Rhesus  or Cynomolgus  monkeys to b e relevant species to 
evaluate the safety of emapalumab. No off-target toxicity was attributed to the drug when 
administered to Cynomolgus  monkeys in 13 weekly doses of up to 200 mg/kg. An enhanced 
susceptibility to infections due to the pharmacological effect of the drug was observed at all dose 
levels (10 to 200 mg/kg/week) in animals originally harboring gastrointestinal pathogens ( Shigella , 
Salmonella, Campylobacter ) prior to emapalumab administration. In a study where Cynomolgus  
monkeys were not initially found to be harboring gastrointestinal pathogens, weekly administrations 
of emapalumab for 8 consecutive weeks at doses up to 30 mg/kg were well tolerated, without the need 
for antibiotic prophylaxis.  
Results from a human tissue cross-reactivity study, involving a panel of [ADDRESS_1067772] with any of the human samples tested. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety pharmacology 
There were no ab nor
mal findings in ECGs taken periodically during treatment and recovery periods in 
the 8 week and 13 week r epe
ated dose toxicology studies in Cynomolgus  monkeys, where animals 
were exposed to doses up to 200 mg/kg of emapalumab week ly. No abnormal findings were observed 
in the histopathological investigations of the hearts and lungs in these animals compared to untreated

the periodic urinalysis readings were also normal, indicating no abnormal effects on renal function. 
There were no histopathological findings in brains in both studies. Furthermore, no abnormal behavior 
of the animals was observed throughout the study periods, suggesting no effects on CNS.  
1.1.3  Clinical Data 
Note to the reader: in ord e
r to reflect the information available at the time the study was initiated  this 
section is not being updated
. Please refer  to the most current Investig ator`s Brochure to ensure 
awareness of the data that served as basis for the approval of  emapalumab in the US for the treatment of adult and pediatric (newborn and older) patients with pHLH with refractory, recurrent or progressive disease or intolerance with conventional HLH therapy and to ensure awareness of all available clinical data. 
A Phase 1 randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled single ascending dose study in 20 healthy 
adult voluntee rs investig at
ing the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles of single 
intravenous (i.v.) administrations of emapalumab was conducted between September 2011 and April 
2012. During this study a total of 14 subjects  received increasing doses of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 3 mg/kg  
emapalumab  (3, 3, 4, and 4 subjects , respectively), while 6 subjects  received placebo.  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis of emapalumab revealed the expected profile for an IgG1 with a 
half-life of approx. 22 day
s, a slow clearance (≤ 0.007 L/h) and a low volume of distribution (< 6 L on 
average). 
All emapalumab infusions were uneventful.  
A similar incidence of commonly reported infections (e.g., upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014]) w as 
observed after administrat i
on of emapalumab and in subjects who had received placebo.  
A Herpes Zoster (HZ) infection was reported in one subject ( ), 14 days after his infusion 
of 3 mg/kg of emapalumab . 
This event was assessed as related to the emapalumab infusion and 
considered as serious (medically significant) in the context of a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers 
(HVs). Its intensity was moderate and its course normal under antiviral therapy. The subject recovered 
with no sequelae.  
An increased susceptibility to HZ infections in patients having dev el oped auto-antibodies against 
IFNγ (Browne SK 2012 ) or having receiv ed ustekinumab (a mAb which decreases  IFNγ  production  by 
[CONTACT_184041] p40 subunit of IL -12) has been described in the literature  (Failla V 2011) .  
In conclusion, the infusion  
of emapalumab was well tolerated and the effects observed during the [ADDRESS_1067773] u
g infusion did not reveal any serious or unexpected off-target safety or 
immunogenicity concerns.  
A study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of emapalumab treatment in patients with primary HLH 
(protocol NI-0501-04) has been compl
eted. The protocol allows for inclusion of patients either 
treatment-naïve (first line patients) or reactivating after initial response to conventional therapy or not 
achieving a satisfactory response or showing intolerance to conventional therapy  (second line 
patients) . Based on  preliminary efficacy and safety evidence, and on the positive benefit/risk profile 
observed so far, the study, which originated as Phase 2 trial, has been recently  amend ed to continu e as 
Phase 2/3 study with the  inclusion of the same stu dy population (i.e., first and second line pHLH 
patients ). Thirty -one patients have been enrolled  as of September  15th 2016, of whom [ADDRESS_1067774] received a median of 7 weeks of 
therapy  (range 4  days-31 weeks; continuation of emapalumab  treatment beyond 8 weeks can occur

premedication needed, and no safety concerns after emapalumab administration have emerged to date. 
Based on data gathered so far, emapalumab treatment has shown the potential to improve relevant 
clinical and laboratory features of HLH such as fever, splenomegaly, cytopenia, hyperferritinemia, 
hypofibrinogenemia, and also CNS signs and symptoms. Early tapering of glucocorticoids has been possible in the majority of patients.

1.2 HEMOPHAGO C
YTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS (HLH) 
HLH is a rare, serious and l
ife threatening disease of pathologic immune activation, characterized by 
[CONTACT_777512] (fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, 
coagulopathy), leading to the development of abnormal immune-mediated pathologies which, through 
tissue damage, ultimately may cause multi-organ failure and death ( Henter JI(a) 1991) . 
HLH comprises primary (genetic/familial) HLH and secondary HLH. 
Primary HLH is a heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder, mostly seen in infancy and early 
childhood with an estimated pr ev
alence in Europe of 1/50,000 li ve births (Henter JI(b) 1991) . The 
disease is invariably fatal with a median survival of less than 2 months after onset of symptoms , if 
untreated  (Janka GE(a) 1983) .  
The genetic defects in pr i
mary HLH affect genes involved in cytotoxic pathway of NK-cells and/or 
cytotoxic lymphocytes requi r
ed to eliminate activated macrophages, encoding proteins for perforin 
synthesis, cytolytic granule maturation, granule exocytosis and release (Filipovich A 2010) . In 
addition , some  immunodeficienc y
 syndrome s, e.g. Griscelli syndrome type 2 (GS -2) and Chediak -
Higashi syndrome (CHS), present frequently with HLH  (Janka GE(b) 2013 ). 
Secondary forms of HLH can occ
ur during the course of an infection, an autoimmune/rheumatic 
disease or in association to a m
alignancy. Secondary forms present with the same signs and symptoms 
of primary HLH and can be equally severe.  
The presence of signs and symptoms of HLH in patients suffering from a rheumatic disease, such as 
systemic Juvenile Idiopathic A
rthritis (sJIA) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), is often 
referred to by [CONTACT_184045] (MAS), as more specifically described in the following section.   
Adult-onset Still’s disease is a rare autoinflammatory disorder sharing the same clinical manifestations 
and laborat o 
ry findings of sJIA ( Jamilloux Y 2015 ). Although traditionally they have been viewed as 
separate disease entities, there is growing recognition that sJIA and AOSD represent a disease 
continuum with different ages of onset, based on a number of shared clinical, genetic and laboratory features, as well as a strikingly similar response to IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors ( Giampi[INVESTIGATOR_52468] C 2012, Feist 
E 2018, Nirmala N 2015 ). 
Importantly, clinical similarities include a clear predisposition to develop MAS in both sJIA and 
AOSD ( Ruscitti P 2017).  
In the pr
esent protocol, any reference made to MAS should be intended as referring to the secondary 
form of HLH occurring in pati en
ts with sJIA/AOSD. 
1.2.1 Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)  
MAS  is 
a severe, potentially life-threatening complication of rheumatic diseases which is caused by 
[CONTACT_777513] T lymphocytes and macrophages. The uncontrolled expansion

Study NI- 0501- 06                   Emapalumab in MAS/sHLH in sJIA/AOSD patients                           Page 20 of 76 
Protocol NI-0501- 06                           Version 2.0 US – 7 January 2020                                     CONFIDENTIAL of these immune cells results in a marked hypercytokinemia and a hyperinflammatory state associated 
with fever, cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly, liver dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities and 
hyperferritinemia, and may progress to multiple organ failure and death (Schulert GS 2015) . 
Because of its strong cli n
ical and pathological similarity to HLH, MAS is classified among the 
secondary or acquired forms of  
HLH. In fact, it has been recently demonstrated that the majority of 
patients with MAS have impaired NK and perforin functional tests and that a significant number of MAS patients show polymorphisms or heterozygous mutations in PRF1 and UNC13D (Zhang M 
2014 ). 
MAS occurs most frequentl y
 in patients with sJIA and AOSD, less often with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE), but is also d es
cribed, though more rarely, in patients with vasculitis, particularly 
with Kawasaki disease. Approximately 7–17% of patients with sJIA develop overt MAS 
(Moradinejad MH 2011, Sawhney S 2001) , some evidence suggests t hat  subclinical MAS may be seen 
in as many as one third of patients with active systemi c disease  (Behrens EM(b) 2007) . 
Because MAS is potenti a
lly fatal, a timely diagnosis and immediate therapeutic intervention are 
essential for appropriat e 
management of the disease. The reported mortality rates in MAS reach 20 -
30%, and it remains the major source of mortality in pediatric rheumatology  (Grom AA(b) 2016 ). 
Different sets of cri t
eria have been proposed for the diagnosis of MAS in patients with sJIA. The 
HLH-2004 diagnostic guidelines  (H
enter JI(c) 2007) , primarily developed for p rimary (genetic) forms 
of HLH, have sometimes  been recommended. However , they present   several limitations when  applied 
to patients with sJIA. For example , criteria such as cytopenias and hypofibrinogenemia  below the 
thresholds re quired by [CONTACT_333435] -[ADDRESS_1067775] increased white blood cell and platelet counts as well as elevated serum levels of 
fibrinogen as a part of the sJIA inflammatory response  (Schulert GS 2015) . As for primary HLH, 
hem
ophagocytosis may not be present in a significant proportion of patients with MAS at presentation  
(Minoia F 2014 ). Moreover , hemophagocytosis, NK cell  a ctivity and sCD25 are not routinely assessed 
in the context of MAS.   
An alternative approach has been proposed based on the application of preliminary diagnostic guidelines (PDG) for MAS com 
plicating sJIA, which were created through the analysis of a cohort of 
patients with MAS compared with a group of patients with a flare of sJIA ( Ravelli A(a) 2005 ).  
The HLH-2004 diagnostic guidel i
nes and the preliminary diagnostic guidelines for sJIA-associated 
MAS were compared for their c
apacity to discriminate sJIA/MAS from sJIA (in the absence of MAS) 
and systemic infection in a large patient population (Davì S 2014) . Although with some lim i tations 
due to its retrospective nature, this study suggested  that the preliminary MAS diagnostic guidelines 
may achieve a satisfactory  balance between sensitivity and specificity, as well as  concordance with the 
diagnosis made by [CONTACT_777514]/ MAS from sJIA, 
while their specificity in discriminating vs. systemic infections was < 30% . Moreo ver, it has been 
reported that the proportion of patients fulfilling each single criterion of the PDG is highly variable, 
and some clinical features (e.g. CNS dysfunction and hemorrhages) may manifest at a late stage of 
MAS, rendering their sensitivity low  in incipi[INVESTIGATOR_777457]  (Lehm berg K 2013) . The sensitivity of t h e 
adapted HLH -2004 set of 4 of 5 criteria was poor (35%), mainly explained by [CONTACT_777515].  
Very recently, an EULAR/ACR-approved set of classification criteria sets have been proposed through a multistep process com
bining expert consensus and retrospective analysis of patient data 
(Ravelli A(b) 2016). These classification criteria did not unequivocally prove to be useful for 
diagnosis in clinical practice (about 30% of patients diagnosed by [CONTACT_777516] 21 of 150
Study NI- 0501- 06                   Emapalumab in MAS/sHLH in sJIA/AOSD patients                           Page 21 of 76 
Protocol NI-0501- 06                           Version 2.0 US – 7 January 2020                                     CONFIDENTIAL classified as not having MAS), and showed important limitations to identify patients who develop ed 
MAS while receiving IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors ( De Benedetti F(b) 2015, Grom AA(a) 2016).     
The limitations of the thus far proposed criteria for MAS diagnosis render the clinical diagnosis by 
[CONTACT_777517] l
 key in the challenge to distinguish MAS from clinical conditions 
presenting with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_777458]-like syndromes. 
There are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of MAS. Likewise, no prospective studies 
have been conducted to evaluat
e the safety and efficacy of the drugs currently used for the treatment 
of MAS, and data is only available as limited case reports or as retrospective surveys.  
Usually, high-dose glucocorticoids are the first-line treatment for MAS. In patients failing to respond 
to glucocorticoids, Cyclo
sporine A (CsA) has been proposed as additional treatment (Stéphan JL 
2001) .  
Being part of the HLH- [ADDRESS_1067776] been a few reports of sJIA patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_777459] (Ramanan AV 2003, Stern A 2001, De Benedetti F(a
 ) 2012, Ruperto N 2012) , as well as of 
patients  who do not respond to these treatments,  indicating that inhibition of IL -1, IL -6R or TNFα  
does not provide full protection against MAS  development nor an efficacious treatment of the full 
blown syndrome . 
A large retrospective, multicenter survey has investigated the clinical, laboratory, and 
histopathological char ac
teristics as well as curren t practice treatment and outcome of MAS in a total 
of 362 patients (Minoia F 2014) .  
In approximately half of t
he patients, MAS occurred in the context of active sJIA in the absence of a 
specific trigger, wit h 
a median time interval between the onset of sJIA and MAS of approximately 4 
months. However, in about 25% of patients MAS occurred at sJIA onset with the diagnosis of MAS 
and sJIA being done simultaneously. In about one third of the patients, an infectious trigger was 
identified, most commonly EBV. Nearly all patients were given glucocorticoids, given the well-
established role of this treatment approach in MAS and HLH . Cyclosporine was the other most 
commonly prescribed drug (61% of patients), while intravenous immunoglobulins, biologic medications (in particular anakinra) and etoposide were given to 36%, 15% and 12% of the patients, respectively.  
The identification of effective therapeutic regimens for MAS represents an area of unmet high medical need. Approximately  30% of
 patients with sJIA and MAS do not respond to systemic glucocorticoids 
alone, or may require prolonged treatment at high doses with associated significant morbidity. When patients fail to respond to glucocorticoids, no good evidence-based data is available on the effectiveness and safety of additional treatments such as CsA or etoposide. The course of MAS may 
become rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777460] a fatal outcome, with about one third of the patients requiring 
ICU admission. Furthermore, no clinical and/or laboratory features have thus far been identified to be 
predictive of poor response to the current standard of care, hence leaving the treating physicians with 
scarce possibility to identify those patients who would rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777461].

 cytokines with overproduction of IFNγ, TNFα, IL-1 and IL-6 (Henter JI(a) 
1991, Imashuku S 1996, Put K 2015, Xu X J 
2012) . During  the last years, evidence has been 
accumulating in support of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_184002]γ  in the development of both HLH  (Jordan MB(a) 
2004, Pachlopnik Schmid J 2009, Zolle
r EE 2011 ) and MAS  (Prenci pe G(b) 2018, Behrens  EM(a) 
2011) . 
For primary
 HLH, perforin knock-out mice are considered a relevant model as these mice, once 
infected with LCMV, devel op 
all the diagnostic and many of the clinical and laboratory characteristic 
features of the human disease. The HLH-like disease that they develop is dependent on CD8+ T cells 
and IFNγ produced in response to antigen stimulation (Jordan MB(a) 2004) . It was demonstrated that 
when 
the high circulating levels of IFNγ are neutralized with the administration of an  anti-IFNγ 
antibody, not only are the clinical and laboratory abnormalities reverted, but also survival rate is 
dramatically improved. On the contrary, the ablation of many other cytokine s had no impact on 
survival  (Jordan MB(a) 2004, Pachlopnik Schmid J 2009) . Furt he r strengthening the importance of 
IFNγ in HLH are the high concentrations of circulating IFNγ  levels found in these patients  (Henter  
JI(a) 1991 , Xu XJ 2012 ).  In a se
ries of  71 patients monitored from HLH diagnosis to treatment and 
follow -up, IFNγ levels were above the upper limit of normal (17.3 pg/mL) in all patients, and in 
particular 53.5% had levels above 1000 pg/mL. It was also reported that IFNγ levels rise early and 
quickly, and can fall from > 5000 pg/mL to normal in [ADDRESS_1067777] been investigated in the context of the emapalumab development program to elucidate t 
he potential pathogenetic role of IFNγ: 
- In a murine model that mimics an infection-driven HLH, repeated administrations of CpG via activation of TLR9 tr i 
ggered a hypercytokinemia that led to clinical (e.g. body weight loss, 
splenomegaly) and laboratory (e.g. cytopenia, hyperferritinemia)  features of HLH (Behrens 
EM(a) 2011) . When IFNγ was neutr
alized by [CONTACT_777519] -IFNγ antibody, 
clinical and laboratory features of the disease were  reverted. The neutralization of IFNγ was 
shown to be complete also in relevant target tissues, such as the liver and the spleen . 
Interestingly, the administration of the anti-IFNγ antibody unveiled an amount of IFNγ [ADDRESS_1067778] the IFNγ production 
in tissues . The two IFNγ -induc ible chemokines  (CXCL9 and CXCL10 ) were upregulated after 
TLR9 stimulation both in blood and in liver, and a significantly correlation was observed 
between serum levels of IFNγ with CXCL9 and CXCL10 serum concentrations. The 
neutralizat ion of IFNγ induced a significant decrease of serum CXCL9 and CXCL10, and o f 
their mRNA levels in the liver  (Buatois V 2017) . 
- An animal model of IL-[ADDRESS_1067779] frequently 
associated with secondary forms of HLH. When triggered with Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 
ligands, increased lethality, increased inflammatory cytokine production and hyperactivation of inflammatory signaling pathways was observed. Moreover, these mice showed a drop in platelet and neutrophil counts, increased sCD25, ferritin and LDH levels, resembling many of the features typi[INVESTIGATOR_777463] (Strippoli R 2012) . In these mice, w hen 
IFNγ i
s neutralized with the administration of  an anti -IFNγ antibody, survival is markedly 
improved and laboratory parameters reverted  (Prencipe G(a) 2015) .

Protocol NI-0501- 06                           Version 2.0 US – 7 January 2020                                     CONFIDENTIAL 1.3.2 Rationale for conducting a Clinical Study in M AS in sJIA/AOSD  patients receiving 
emapalumab treatment 
Evidence of high levels of IFNγ and of IFNγ-inducible chemok ines has been  gathered in an 
observational study conducted in patients with secondary forms of HLH, either consequent  to 
infections, or of unknown origin (pHLH having been excluded by [CONTACT_777520], absence 
of mutation in known genes causing pHLH and absence of family history) or with MAS occurring in 
the context of sJIA.  
In 14 patients with secondary HLH (in 7 of whom an underlying infection was identifiable), serum 
samples were analyzed duri ng
 active full blown disease and during disease remission. Levels of IFNγ, 
CXCL9 and CXCL10 were markedly higher in the active phase compared to disease remission (IFNγ : 
34.7 vs. <3.5 pg/ml; CXCL9: [ZIP_CODE] vs. 745 pg/ml; CXCL10: 4420 vs. 132 pg/ml; median values). 
IFNγ levels significantly correlated with the levels of CXCL9 (p=0.0018) and, to a lesser extent, of CXCL10 (p=0.014). The levels of IFNγ and chemokines (in particular CXCL9) correlated 
significantly with parameters of disease severity, such as neutrophil and platelet counts, ferritin and 
ALT, further supporting the pathogenic role of IFNγ in secondary HLH and the potential use of chemokines as relevant biomarkers of the disease (Buatois V 2017 ). 
Similar findings have been shown
 in patients with MAS occurring in patients with sJIA. Serum 
concentrations of IFNγ, IFN γ
-inducible chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11) and IL-6 were 
measured in 54 patients with sJIA, of whom 20 had MAS. The levels of IL-6 were comparable in patients with full-blown MAS and those with active sJIA but without MAS at the time of sampling. On the contrary, circulating IFNγ and chemokine levels were significantly higher in MAS, particularly 
for CXCL9, whose median levels were approximately 15-fold higher compared to patients with active sJIA without MAS ([ZIP_CODE] vs. 837 pg/mL; p=0.005). Noteworthy, a significant correlation was demonstrated only in patients with MAS between CXCL9 levels and parameters typi[INVESTIGATOR_777464] (p=0.041) , neutrophil (p=0.010) and platelet (p=0.022) counts, ALT (p=0.044) and 
LDH (p=0.013). Levels of IFNγ also correlated with laboratory parameters of disease severity, with 
the exception of LDH for which statistical significance was not achieved (Bracaglia C 2017 ). 
Increased levels of CXCL [ADDRESS_1067780] also been reported in patients with AO SD (Han JH 
2017) .  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_777465] e 
2 study, as well as the twin study in Europe, is intended to assess the 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynami cs
 profile, the safety and tolerability, and the efficacy of 
emapalumab as treatment of MAS in sJIA/AOSD patients.  
Based on the evidence above described, there is a solid rationale for the neutralization of IFNγ as 
targeted therapy for 
MAS/sHLH occurring in sJIA/AOSD patient, and for investigating the benefit of 
emapalumab treatment in this patient population. 
Additionally, preliminary clinical data previously gathered in a study conducted in patients with 
primary HLH receiving e
mapalumab treatment either as first and second line ( NI-0501-04 study) , 
indicated :  
1. a favorable tolerability profile of emapalumab and absence of relevant safety concerns:  
- all infusions administered were well tolerated, confirming the observations made in 
healthy volunteers 
- emergi ng
 infections reported in the study generally resolved upon proper treatment 
and HLH contro l

[CONTACT_777521], whereas all other infections have been related to 
patients’ impaired immune status due to HLH and to previous or concomitant treatments. Of note, histoplasmosis resolved upon proper treatment 
- no death has been attributed to emapalumab administration. 
2. a favorable impact on dise as
e parameters, with appreciable onset of effects within the first 
days of treatment:

transplant .  
3. a predictable pharmacokinetic profile of emapalumab from the PK modeling and simulation 
approach, and evidence that neutr a
lization of IFNγ is achieved and maintained 
In conclusion, there is a strong rationale for neutralizing I FNγ in MAS  secondary to rhe umatic 
diseases based on pre-clinical and clinical evidence, and the preliminary data in pHLH patients 
indicates a favorable benefit/risk profile of emapalumab with a significant improvement to normalization of HLH features.  
It is therefore anticipated that emapalumab can represent an innovative and effective therapeutic 
approach in the management o 
f this severe, life-threatening complication of rheumatic diseases , 
potentially limiting side effects from long-term high dose glucocorticoid treatment.   
Please refer to the most recent Investigator Brochure to review clinical data available to date. 
The study population will be represented by [CONTACT_23270] a diagnosis of sJIA or AOSD who develop 
MAS. No diagnostic criteria are av ai
lable of sJIA. The classification criteria proposed by [CONTACT_777522] 6 weeks. While they appear to be used to classify 
patients, they cannot be used at disease presentation. In order to allow inclusion of patients presenting 
with MAS as a feature of onset of sJIA, the operational criteria designed by [CONTACT_777523] (childhood 
arthritis and rheumatology research alliance) to identify patients with sJIA early in their disease course (DeWitt EM et al. Arthritis Care Res 2012, Appendix A ) have been also considered to assess patient 
eligibility.  
The number of  p
atients meeting the ILAR classification criteria will be in any case included in the

3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
This is an open-label, single arm, international, multicenter pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] 2.  
After signature [CONTACT_43998], patients will be screened and assessed for eligibility ( Section 
3.2). 
The study will be conducted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_777467], at minimum, the day before the first 
administration of the study dr ug
 (study day minus one, SD-1) until SD15 at the earliest.   
Discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_777468]15 onwards , at the Investigator’ s  discretion if the 
patient ’s condition allows, provided that no active infections requiring i.v. antimicrobial therapy are 
present.  
For a detailed description of the study procedures, see Section 8 . 
The study flow-chart is summarized in Figure 1 .

with the agreement of both the Sponsor and the Investigator. 
Detailed information regarding the inadequate response to high dose i.v. glucocorticoids ( as required 
for patient eligibility ) and to an y other initial MAS treatments  administer ed prior to emapalumab , will 
be collected and recorded  in the CRF . 
Samples for infection screening need to be collected for analysis according to the protocol 
requirements; however avai l
ability of the results is not required prior to emapalumab initiation if the 
patient’s medical condition warrants rapid treatment, provided that there are no clinical findings 
suggestive for the presence of any of the infections which represent exclusion criteria. 
In the case of a patient having received BCG vaccination, a [COMPANY_003] test must be performed and 
combined with an IFNγ-release assay. 
A neg
ative serum pregnancy test has to be documented in female patients who are post -pubescent.  
For a detailed description of the study procedures during the screening period see Section 8 .  
3.3 TREATMENT PERIOD 
Emapalumab will be admi ni
stered i.v. at the initial dose of 6 mg/kg, and continued at the dose of 3 
mg/kg, every 3 days until SD15, and t
hen twice-a-week for additional 2 weeks, i.e. until SD28.  
Treatment may be shortened upon achievement of complete clinical response (i.e. MAS remission), 
however at least two i n
fusions of emapalumab at the dose of 3 mg/kg have to be administered (i.e. 
after SD6). In such circumstances, efficacy/safety visits have to be in any case performed every 3 days until SD15 and then twice-a-week until SD28.  
In the absence of a trend of improvement in key MAS parameters (including but not limited to ferritin, 
LDH, AST/ALT and PLT count) sug 
gestive of lack of response, the emapalumab regimen may be 
adapted (the frequency between infusions shortened, the dose increased or the  treatment prolonged beyond 4 weeks ) upon confirmation of a favorable benefit/risk profile in that individual patient.  
3.[ADDRESS_1067785] visit for a given patient under the NI-0501-06 study will normally be on SD56 (except in case 
of prolongat i
on of emapalumab treatment beyond 4 weeks, as above described). 
Afterwards all patients will be asked to enter a long-term follow-up study, NI0501-05, to allow long-
term outcome and safety survei l
lance, and to monitor emapalumab elimination profile.  
In the event that additional monitoring of emapalumab concentrations is required (e.g., emapalumab  
serum levels still mea sur
able at EoS) and cannot be performed in the context of the long-term follow-
up study, unscheduled visits will have to be performed beyond SD56, until serum emapalumab levels 
are no longer detectable. These measurements should occur not less than every two weeks.

two hours depending on the volum e 
to infuse. Treatment will be continued at the dose of 3 mg/kg 
every 3 days until SD15, and twice-a-week thereafter for a total of 4 weeks (i.e. up to SD28).  
Treatment may be shortened upon achievement of complete clinical response (i.e. MAS remission), 
however at least two i n

may be adapted (the frequency between infusions shortened, the dose increased or the treatment  prolonged beyond 4 weeks) upon assessment of a favorable benefit/risk profile in that individual 
patient. 
5.3 RATIONALE FOR DOSE SELECTION  
 The rationale for the dosi n
g strategy foreseen for this study is based on: 
‐ Data from in vitro  experiments invest i gating the binding kinetics of emapalumab to human IFNγ 
and the functional inhibition of human IFNγ by [CONTACT_653427]; 
‐ PK information from recombinant IFNγ in human; 
‐ Data from the Phase 1 N I
-0501-03 study in which emapalumab was administered to healthy 
volunteers;

The analysis of data gene r
ated from the ongoing study in which primary HLH patients have been 
treated with emapalumab has
 allowed to estimate the production rate of IFNγ through the assessment 
of the “total IFNγ” (i.e. IFNγ bound to emapalumab and free IFNγ), and consequently the 
concentration of emapalumab required to neutralize the variably high IFNγ concentrations. It has also been possible to determine that when there is a high production of IFNγ, target mediated drug disposition occurs. Importantly, the relationship between IFNγ and the IFNγ-inducible chemokines

led to the selection of the e
mapalumab doses to be administered to patients with MAS not responding 
to high dose glucocorticoid therapy are the followings:    
‐ there is a tight correlation between IFNγ and the IFNγ-related chemoki nes  CXCL9 and CXCL10 , 
as well as between disease parameters and levels of IFNγ and IFNγ-related chemokines in patients 
suffering from HLH (Buatois V 2017 , Bracaglia C 2017) ; 
‐ the hi g
her the circulating levels of the IFN -related chemokines, the h igher is the concentration of 
emapalumab (and therefore the dose of emapalumab) required to neutralize the corresponding 
levels of IFNγ (data from the NI-0501-04 study on file at Sobi AG ); 
‐ the neutralization of IFNγ has been shown to have a ther ap eutic role in primary HLH patients 
(Jordan MB(b) 2015 ); 
‐ a trend towards higher levels of circulating IFNγ-related chemokines has be en observed in 
patients with secondary forms of HLH compared to primary HLH patients (Buatois V 2017 , 
Bracaglia C 2017)  during or soon af t
er HLH conventional  therapy ( see Figure 2 ; data from the NI-
0501-04 study on file at Sobi AG);  
‐ the onse t
 of MAS is usually acute and the disease worsens rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777471]  fr
om the very beginning of treatment; 
‐ in MAS patients, differently from patients with primary HLH, the risk of reactivation is extremely 
low once HLH remission is  
achieved, and HSCT is not required. Therefore in patients with MAS, 
shorter treatment duration is anticipated compared to primary HLH patients, not requiring a maintenance phase while awaiting for HSCT.

concentrations will remain within the ones already achieved in primary HLH patients treated in the 
ongoing study. 
The PK model used to produce these simulations is a two compartment model with linear elimination 
assuming allometric scalin g
 based on body weight (BW) to which an additional non-linear (TMDD) 
elimination pathway characterized by a VMAX and a KM has been added. Parameters used in the simulations are from a population pharmacokinetic analysis of study NI-0501-03 and assuming allometric scaling. VMAX is the IFNγ concentration (0.1 nM) multiplied by [CONTACT_777524]γ 
clearance (1.2 L/h/kg) divided by [CONTACT_777525]. KM is assumed to be 
equal to KD.

initial dose of 6 mg/kg foll o
wed by 9 doses of 3 mg/kg every 3 days  
 
Note :  
Simulations are shown for sJIA MAS patients of an approximate body weight of [ADDRESS_1067799] peak and trough concentrations observed in HLH patients from study NI- 0501 -04/05 (data cut-off date of June 24, 2016). 
The proposed dosing strategy is further supported by [CONTACT_616423]: 
‐ primary HLH patients treated with emapalumab in the context of the ongoing study who were 
characterized by [CONTACT_777526]9 comparable to the ones expected in MAS all required a rapid 
and significant emapalumab dose increase;  
‐ primary  HLH patients having a high production of IFNγ, required a high  dose of emapalumab , 
demonstrating the presence of target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) , i.e. a pronounced 
increased clearance of emapalumab  due to  the high production of IFNγ. The presence of TMDD, 
while  requir ing to administer  emapalumab  at high doses and sometimes more frequently, prevent s 
emapalumab  accumulation to occur;  
‐ to date emapalumab has shown a good safety profile when administered to primary HLH patients 
up to the dose of 10 mg/kg, ac
hieving similar or even higher emapalumab exposures compared to 
the ones expected to occur in MAS patients. More than [ADDRESS_1067800] been performed in all 
patients treated (including CU) and around 20% have been performed at a dose of  6mg/kg.

Protocol NI-0501- 06  Version 2.0 US – 7 January 2020  CONFIDENTIAL In conclusion, based on a production rate of IFNγ expected to be high in sJIA/AOSD patients with 
overt MAS (Bracaglia C 2017), an initial dose of 6 mg/kg followed by [CONTACT_777527] 3 
mg/kg  is deemed  appropriate  to achieve  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777472] a fast neutralization of IFNγ activity. 
5.4 IMP HANDLING 
5.4.1  Packaging and Label
ing 
Emapalumab will be supplied t
o study sites in single-use glass vials containing a 2 or a 10 ml solution 
at a concentration of 5 mg /
ml. Labeling and packaging will be prepared to meet local regulatory 
requirements. 
5.4.[ADDRESS_1067801] will check for accurate delivery and absence of temperature deviation alarms. 
The study drug should be stored between 2 - 8°C (36 - 46°F). All vials must be stored in a secure 
locked location in a tempera t
ure-controlled refrigerator or cold room. Any deviations from the 
recommended storage conditions should be immediately reported to the Sponsor and responsible study 
clinical research associate ( CRA ). Affected vials should not be used and should be quarantined until 
the Sponsor has authorized their use, return or destruction. 
Documentation of the storage conditions of the study drug must be maintained over the timeframe the 
study drug is stored at the si t
e, until such time as it is used, disposed of, or returned to Sobi AG or 
designee. 
Regular inspections of the emapalumab vials are required, as detailed in the IMP manual i nd ications 
for the Preparation and Administration of Individual Doses of Study Drug emapalumab. 
5.4.4  IMP Preparation, Administration, Accountability and Destruction 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Preparation  
The study drug must be 
prepared only by a Pharmacist or other appropriately qualified staff member, 
specifically authorized by t he 
Investigator/Pharmacist and appropriately licensed to perform the task. 
The specific dose to be administered for an individual infusion is determined as detailed in Section 
5.2.  
Full instructions for the preparation, including dilution steps, and method for administration of 
emapalumab are available in the I MP 
Manual that will be provided to all the investigational sites.

improve patient’s comfort and ensure a reliable drug administration. However, as per previous 
experience in HLH patients in whom central venous access was not possible or not maintained, 
emapalumab infusions have been performed safely via peripheral venous access. Since no data is 
available on the compatibility of emapalumab with other intravenous substances or additives, other medications/substances should not be added to the infusion material or infused simultaneously through the same intravenous line. If the same intravenous line is used for subsequent infusions of other drugs, the line should be flushed with saline before and after infusion of emapalumab. 
The infusion of emapalumab will be administered under the direct supervision of the Investigator (or delegate). It should be preferabl y
 performed in the morning, and at the same time of the day during the 
study whenever possible.  
Details of the infusion administered must be recorded, including: 
 The date of administration 
 The time (start and end) of infusion 
 The volume administered 
 Any adverse effects or general illness experienced by [CONTACT_102]. 
 Any other event(s) judged relevant by [CONTACT_14523]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Account ability 
When the study drug  
is received at the site, the Investigator or Pharmacist (or appropriate designee) 
should acknowledge its recei p
t by [CONTACT_2960] (or initialing) and dating the documentation. 
Documentation should be returned to Sobi AG (or its designee) and a copy retained in the 
Investigator’s file. 
The dispensing of the study drug shall be carefully recorded on Drug Accountability Forms and an 
accurate accounting must be avai l
able for verification by [CONTACT_777528]. 
Drug accountability records shall include: 
 Confirmation of the study drug’s delivery to the study site 
 The inventory at the study site 
 The use of study drug by [CONTACT_6904]  
 Proper storage conditions at the study site 
 The return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of unused products. 
The records should include dat
es, quantities, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], batch number, and patient number.  
Unused study drug must not be discarded or used for any purpose not authorized by [CONTACT_653418].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Destruction, Return and Disposal  
Periodically during the st
udy and at the conclusion of participation of the study by [CONTACT_779], the CRA

parameters are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777473]. 
High dose i.v. glucocorticoids should not be lower than 2 mg/kg/day of PDN equivalent in 2 divided 
doses (or  at least 60 mg/day in pat i
ents of 30 kg or more).   
During the study, emapalumab will be initially administered on a background of at least 2 mg/kg/day 
of PDN equivalent ( or at  l
east 60 mg/day in patients of 30 kg or more ). 
Glucocorticoid tapering may be initiated as soon as the patient ’s conditions allow, accordi ng  to the 
Investigator’s assessment. The tapering scheme can be selected by [CONTACT_737], with the objective 
of reaching the same (or lower) dose being administered before the occurrence of MAS (in patients 
already on treatment for sJIA/AOSD) or decreasing by 50% (or more) the glucocorticoid dose administered at initiation of emapalumab treatment (in patients presenting with MAS as first manifestation of sJIA/AOSD).   
In the event of disease worsening after glucocorticoid tapering, a higher dose can be re-introduced and maintained until a satis f
actory response is achieved according to the Investigator.  
6.2 PROPHYLACTIC TREATME NT  
Prophylaxis for Herpes  
Zoster  (HZ) virus in fection will be administered to mitigate the potential risk 
associated to emapalumab administration (see Benefit/Risk Management, Section 10.5) . 
Patients will therefore receive the prophylactic treatment starting preferably the day before (i.e. SD-1), and in any case prior to, initi at 
ion of emapalumab treatment on SD0, and continued until serum 
emapalumab levels are no longer detectable, as follows: 
 For HZ virus prevention, according t o I nstitution/Country Guidelines/Recommendations 
(e.g. Acyclovir 200 mg four times daily for children over two years, for children under 
two years 100 mg four times daily). 
In the unlikely event that a patient, previously vaccinated for TB, shows  a Purified Protein Derivative  
([COMPANY_003])  test result ≥ 5mm and a nega tive IFNγ -release assay , the patients  will receive  TB prophylaxis  
according to Institution /Country  Guidelines/Recommendations (e.g. Isoniazid).   
In case emapalumab concentrations are still measurable after the end of the study, it is required that 
the above mentioned prophylaxis b e 
maintained, until serum emapalumab levels are no longer 
detectable. 
6.3 CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
6.3.1  Cyclosporine A, methotrexate and anakinra 
Cyclosporine A (CsA ) may be cont i
nued, if already s t arted at least 3 days prior to initiation of 
emapalumab treatment. CsA dose adjustments will be performed if required based on results of therapeutic drug monitoring, in order to maintain therapeutic levels. CsA can be withdrawn at any 
time during the study, upon judgment of the Investigator. CsA should not be introduced once 
emapalumab administration has started.  
Methotrexate may be continued if ongoing as treatment for the underlying disease.  
If ongoing and if started (at any dose) at least 3 days before initiation of emapalumab treatment, 
anakinra may be continued at a m axi

study. In the event that emapal um
ab concentrations are still measurable after the end of the study, the 
period with no vaccinations should be extended until serum emapalumab levels are no longer 
detectable.  
6.4 EMERGENCY TREATMENT 
As none of the emapalumab i nf
usions administered to healthy volunteers or patients has triggered any 
medically significant r
eaction, this is considered an unlikely event during the study. However, should 
severe allergic reactions (such as anaphylactic shock) occur, they would require prompt i.v. treatment with adrenaline and antihistamines. Oxygen shall be supplied through a face mask. Patients must have an appropriately sized i.v. line that allows rapid infusion of colloid volume substitution. Transfer to 
the intensive care unit of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_777477].  
Following the first administration of emapalumab and before leaving the study site, each patient

The main objective of the study is to confirm that the proposed dosing regimen is adequate in relation 
to the IFNγ production in patients with MAS secondary to sJIA/AOSD.  
For this purpose, a PK-PD analysis will be perfo r med based on:  
 levels of circulating emapalumab 
 levels of total IFNγ 
 levels of main IFNγ –i
nduced chemokines (namel y  CXCL9 and CXCL10). 
7.1 PHARMACOKINETICS ENDPOINTS 
Free emapalumab concentrati ons 
will be measured in serum to determine the PK profile of 
emapalumab in this patient 
population, and to confirm the adequacy of the proposed dosing regimen. 
All PK data will be summarised  using appropriate graphical and tabular presentations. Descriptive 
non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis (NCA) will be applied: C max (concentration 
corresponding to T max), T max (time of maximum observed concentration), C EOI (concentration at the 
end of infusion), C trough (concentration just before administration), AUC  (area under curve of a dosing 
interval), AUC last (area under curve f rom the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration), t½ 
(plasma half -life), Individual and mean PK parameters will be tabulated. Exploratory compartmental 
PK analysis and population PK analysis will be undertaken to investigate linear and non -linear 
(TMDD) kinetics.  
In addition, PK analysis will be done when a total of [ADDRESS_1067804] been recruited in Europe and 
North America inclusive, to  as
sess the appropriateness of the dose selection. 
7.2 PHARMACODYNAMICS ENDPOINT S  
Assessment of PD parameters will include, but will not be limited to, the followings: 
 Levels of circulating free IFN  at pre-dose, and of total  IFNγ (free IFNγ+bound to 
emapalumab) after initiation of emapalumab treatment.  
 Levels of the main IFNγ-induced chemokines (C X CL9, CXCL10). 
 Correlation between chemokine levels (CXCL9, CXCL10) and levels of free emapalumab, free IFNγ (pre-dose) and tot al 
 IFNγ ( exploratory analysis ). 
 Correlation between chemokine and total IFNγ levels, and laboratory  parameters of MAS 
severity, e.g. ferritin, platelet counts, LFTs ( exploratory analysis ). 
 Levels of other potential disease markers (e.g. sCD25, sCD163, IL-18, IL-10, IL-6, TNF,). 
 Levels (if any) of
 circulating antibodies against emapalumab to determine immunogenicity, 
i.e. the development of anti-drug
 antibodies (ADAs). 
7.3 SAFETY ENDPOINTS 
The tolerability and saf et
y of emapalumab treatment will be assessed as follows:  
 Incidence, severity, causality and outcomes of AEs (serious and non-serious), with particular attention being paid to inf e 
ctions. 
 Evolution of laboratory parameters, in particular CBC, LFTs, inflammatory markers (ferritin and CRP) and coagulation paramet er 
s. 
 Number of patients withdrawn due to safety reasons.

 Time to achievement of glucocorticoids tapering (as defined above). 
 Survival time. 
 Number of patients withdrawn from the study due to lack of efficacy. 
 MAS remission is defined as

8 OUTLINE OF STUDY PROCEDURES 
8.1 STUDY VISITS 
For a detailed description of the visit schedule and assessments, please refer to Table 1  (Schedule of 
Assessment – Screening and emapa l
umab Treatment Period ) and Table 2  (Schedule of Assessment –
Evaluation Period). 
Patients w
ill be recruited from specialized study centers in North America, in which an intensive care 
unit is available. If not alr e
ady hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], the patient will enter the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_777478]-1. 
During the emapalumab Treatment Period, Infusion Visits will occur every 3 days until SD15, and 
twice-a-week thereaft e
r until SD28, and will also serve as Efficacy/Safety visits. In case emapalumab 
treatment is shortened after SD6, Efficacy/Safety visits have to be in any case performed with the same schedule until SD28, in order to assess the evolution of MAS clinical and laboratory features, and to closely monitor safety.     
From SD28 and during the Evaluation Period, visits will occur on a weekly schedule (a  2-day 
window is allowed) for e f
ficacy and safety evaluation, and follow-up after emapalumab last infusion.

ired based on clinical judgment. 
 Broad search for pathogens during the study (beside the ones required per protocol) should be done if there is any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] i nf 
ection.  
 Chest X-ray during the study (beside the ones required per protocol) should be done more frequently in case of cli ni 
cal suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a pulmonary infection. 
 Functional tests relevant to HLH diagnosis should be performed whenever possible; however 
availability of result s 
is not required for patient inclusion in the study. 
The following situations will not be considered as protocol deviations: 
 Missing data if not occurring at [ADDRESS_1067808] be signed by [CONTACT_102] ( as required by [CONTACT_1769]) or  by [CONTACT_102]’s 
legally authorized representative prior to any study-related procedures, with the assent of patients who 
are deemed suitable to provide it, as applicable .  
Patients will be screened for eligibility prior to enrolment into the study. The Investigator must keep a log of the patients screened for  
the study and reasons for non-eligibility, if applicable. 
Screening evaluations should be completed within up to [ADDRESS_1067809] administration of the study drug (SD0). Clinical  
and laboratory assessments should be performed as close as possible to 
initiation of emapalumab  treatment, preferably o n SD -1, as described in Table 1 . 
In the event that a patient’s medical condition warrants rapid treatment initiation, and to av oid 
unnecessary repetition of recent interventions, results of tests which have been performed as part of the normal patient’s care at the site (or at the referring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) not more than [ADDRESS_1067810] emapalumab infusion, may be considered for screening purposes (inclusion/exclusion criteria checks) with the agreement of both the Sponsor and Investigator. 
The following patient information must be collected: 
 Demographic and medical history 
 Detailed information on inadequate response to high dose i.v. glucocorticoids and to other MAS treatments, including VAS of MAS activity and MAS laboratory parameters including , 
but not limited to: blood cell counts, ferritin, AST/ALT/LDH, fibrinogen, d-dimer, 
triglycerides, 
 Concomitant medication at screening.  
 Date of sJIA diagnosis/high presumption of sJIA or AOSD diagnosis. 
 sJIA/AOSD treatment previously received and ongoing at the time of screening. 
 Date and criteria of eligibility.  
 Relevant 
clinical and laboratory data in order to characterize a posteriori  the study popul ation 
according to HLH-2004 criteria.

8.3.1 Vital signs   
Vital signs include measurement of body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation . 
Body temperature will be recorded in the morning of visit days as indicated in the SoA. 
On the day of emapalumab infusion, heart rate and oxygen saturation will be recorded before and 
continuously monitored after the inf u
sion for 4 hours. 
Body temperature and blood pressure will be recorded before and at regular intervals after emapalumab 
infusion as follows: 
- at the f
irst infusion, every hour  10-min during the first  [ADDRESS_1067820]-dose, at all other infusions, 
every hour  10-min during the first [ADDRESS_1067821]-dose (if no safety concerns have emerged after 
the first infusion).  
Blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation will be measured every 15 minutes (  5-min) during 
emapalumab inf us
ion. 
8.3.2 Physical examination 
A complete physical examinat i
on will be performed at screening and at each study visit (before the 
infusion when emapalumab is admini
stered).  
Physical examination prior to each infusion may be performed in the late afternoon of the previous day 
instead of the morning of the i n
fusion (the data will be captured on the infusion day of the CRF). 
At screening height (in cm), weight (in kg) and Body Surface Area (BSA) as calculated by [CONTACT_777529]. 
Subsequent physical exam i
nations will include i) recording of body wei ght prior to infusion and every 
2 weeks during the evaluation period for patients weighing less than 10 kg for patients weighing more 
than 10 kg, weight will be measured every 2 weeks throughout the study ; ii) abdominal palpation for 
assessment of liver and spleen size (in cm from costal grill); iii) follow-up of any abnormalities 
previously recorded as well as occurrence of new signs and symptoms. 
8.3.3 MAS clinical signs and symptoms  
The I
nvestigator will be asked to provide his assessment of improvement/resolution of MAS signs and 
symptoms at the study tim epoi
nts indicated in the SoA. In addition , the Investigator will assess and 
document the clinical parameters as listed below at the visits on SD-1, SD14, SD21, SD28, SD42 and 
SD56 (and additional time-points as indicated in the SoA in case emapalumab treatment is shortened after 
SD6 due to a complete response or if study treatment is prolonged beyond SD28):  
 
‐ Fever (greater than 38.0 C°) 
‐ Skin Rash 
‐ Hemorragic manifestations

8.4 LABORATORY ASSESSMEN T
S 
Blood and urine laboratory ana
lyses are part of the routine monitoring of MAS patients, thus samples will 
be analyzed locally. Analyse s 
done on blood samples will favor as much as possible the use of micro-
sampling techniques. 
If additional safety laboratory samples are required for safety reasons, the number of samples will take 
into account the weight and healt h s
tatus of the patient. 
Laboratory assessments will be performed at each study visit and will include: 
 Hematology:  complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential count, a dedicated lymphocyte 
subset s 
count  (at screening and EoS visit ), and platelets . 
 Biochemistry: Ferritin, Triglycerides, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotr ans 
ferase (ALT), gamma Glutamyl Transferase (γGT), Alkaline 
Phosphatase (ALP), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin, glucose, electrolytes, 
albumin, creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN).  
 Coagulation tests: activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), D-dimers and 
fibrinogen. 
 Urinalysis
: glucose, blood, protein, leucocytes, ketones, pH and specific gravity. On SD0, 
urinalysis will be per f
ormed before emapalumab infusion (only if not already performed at 
screening). Urinalysis will be repeated at EoS.  
 Serum pregnancy test (if applicable) at screening and EoS. Additional pregnancy tests will be performed upon suspi[INVESTIGATOR_777479], as long as 
emapalumab serum concentrations are detectable. 
8.5 SEARCH FOR INFECTIONS 
Search for infections that r
epresent exclusion criteria include the following pathogens: 
‐ Mycobacterium Tuberculosis   
At screening, it will  
be performed via IFNγ-release assay or PP D test. In addition, a baseline via 
polymerase chain reaction [PCR] in a relevant specimen (e.g., urine or blood, if sputum is not easily obtained) has to be obtained , as this test will be used during the course of the study to 
perform regular TB monitoring .    
After initiation of emapalumab treatment, search for TB via PCR has to be performed every 2 weeks as long as emapalumab i s 
detectable in serum.  
Page 45 of 150

Protocol NI-0501- 06                              Version 2.0 US – [ADDRESS_1067822] be performed and 
combined with an IFNγ-release assay. 
‐ Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_4017] , Shigella , Salmonella , Campyl oba cter, Histoplasma Capsulatum and 
Leishmania   
Search for all these pathogens have to be performed at screening. During the study, search for 
these pathogens has to be perfo r
med if there is any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_184010]. 
A first screening for Histoplasma Capsulatum may  be performed using galactomannan assay , 
however if the test is positive, confirmation should be obtained by [CONTACT_2329] a Histoplasma 
Capsulatum specific test. The presence of Leishmania  can be ascertained by [CONTACT_777530]. 
In addition, search for the following infections is  required:  
 Herpes Simplex Vir us 
(HSV), Herpes Zoster Virus  (HZV), H epatitis B Virus  (HBV ), Hepatitis C 
Virus  (HCV ), Human Immune Deficiency Virus  (HIV) by [CONTACT_184052], a t 
screening and whenever there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_184010]. 
 EBV, CMV, Adenoviruses by [CONTACT_956], at screening and every 2 weeks as long as 
emapalumab is detectable in serum.  
A patient with a clinical assessment (including chest X-ray) not indicative of the presence of an active 
infection, provided that a
 usable specimen has been taken and the microbiological analysis is ongoing, 
can be enrolled prior to the availability of the results, if the patient’s clinical conditions require a rapid initiation of emapalumab tre atment. 
8.6 IMAGING 
8.6.1 Abdominal ultrasound 
Abdominal ultrasounds, includ i
ng spleen (longitudinal) measurements  and assessment of hepatomegaly 
presence , will be performed at screening and  every [ADDRESS_1067823] X-ray should be done more frequently in case of clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a 
pulmonary infection. 
8.6.3 Brain MRI 
Brain MRI should be perform ed 
in case of neurological symptoms occurrence, prior to emapalumab 
initiation (or at lates t
 by [CONTACT_66309]6), and repeated at the end of the study, whenever possible. 
8.7 OTHER PROCEDURES 
8.7.1 ECG  
12-lead ECG will be perf or
med and interpreted locally by [CONTACT_777531].  
At sc r
eening, triplicate ECG (three consecutive recordings) is required in order to obtain a stable 
baseline. ECG is mandatory at screening, after the first emapalumab infusion, and at the end of the study, however 
it should also be performed w
henever required based on clinical judgment.

8.8 PHARMACOKINETIC/PHARMACODYNAMIC  A SSESSMENTS  
8.8.1 Pharmacokinetics 
Serum samples for PK an al
ysis will be collected at the visits indicated i n the SoA ( Table 1  and Table 2 ). 
In case of need for prioritization of blood analysis (considering weight and health status of th e patient) , 
laboratory safety parameters (which would be done as normal disease monitoring ) may need to be 
prioritized over samples for PK assessments, that in turn will be prioritized over biomarkers exploratory 
parameters.  
On the days of infusion, PK samples should be collected before and after (between 15 and 30 minutes 
after) the infusion.   
Afte
r the first emapalumab infusion, PK samples will be also collected on SD1 (around [ADDRESS_1067824]- 
infusion) and SD2 (around [ADDRESS_1067825]-infusion). Additionally, PK samples will be collected on SD5 
(around 48 hrs. after the second emapalumab infusion).  
After completion of emapalumab infusions, samples for PK assessment will be collected until serum 
emapalumab concentration are no longer detectable (or until consent is withdrawn), as indicated in the SoA until the EoS visitIn case of CNS involvement, if lumbar puncture is performed for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes, PK analysis in CSF samples may be performed. 
Details on sample preparation and handling will be described in a separate laboratory manual.
 
8.8.2 Pharmacodynamics 
Serum samples for PD analysis will be collected at the visits indicated in the SoA ( Table 1  and Table 2 ).  
In case of need for prioritization of blood analysis (considering weight and health status of the patient ), 
laboratory safety parameters and PK assessments will be prioritized over biomarkers exploratory 
parameters.  
Pharmacodynamics assessments include the measurement of: 
 Free IFN  levels prior to emapal um ab treatment start, and total IFNγ (free IFNγ+bound to 
emapalumab) during emapalumab treatment. Samples for total IFNγ measurements will be taken 
pre-dose on infusion visits, except for the first infusion when free IFN  will be measured pre-
dose and total IFNγ post-dose.  
 Chemokines known to be induced by [CONTACT_20129]γ (CXCL9, CXCL10) and sCD25. On infusion visits, 
serum samples will be collected pre-dose only. 
 Other potential disease markers (e.g., sCD163, IL-18, IL-10, IL-6, TNF ). Serum sampl es  will 
be collected on SD0 and every 2 weeks during the course of the study.   
In case of CNS involvement, if lumbar puncture is performed for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes, 
biomarker analysis in CSF sam pl
es may be performed. 
Details on sample preparation and handling will be described in a separate laboratory manual.

Serum samples for the assessment of ADAs  will be collected on SD0 (pr i or to emapalumab infusion) and 
at the End of Study visit, and in case of PK Clearance of emapalumab is faster than expected during the 
study. Details on sample preparation and handling will be described in a separate laboratory manual. 
8.9 WITHDRAWAL VISIT 
The same procedure s
 described for the EoS Visit should be followed by [CONTACT_777532] f r
om the study, as soon as possible after the decision to withdraw is made.  
For patients who withdraw from the study as a result of their own decision or the decision of their parent/guardian, the Investi g 
ator should contact [CONTACT_102] (or parent/guardian) and ask them to attend a 
withdrawal visit as soon as possible and in any case within 30 days from termination. 
Patients who are withdrawn due to a serious adverse event (SAE) should be follow ed-up until the 
resolution of 
the event or until the outcome of the event is known and stable. 
8.10 UNPLANNED (UNSCHEDUL ED) VISITS 
Unplanned visits may occ
ur, should the patient need to be assess ed or treat ed for any cli ni cal condition 
that arises during the study. This may include the evaluation and follow-up of AEs, SAEs or laboratory 
tests. The assessments (as detailed in the SoA ) should always be performed at minimum , but additional 
evaluations may be added according to the clinical judgment of the Investigator. 
8.10.1  Unplanned Assessments 
Additional samples to as se
ss laboratory parameters and PK/PD may be required for safety reasons and/or 
for a better characteriz at
ion of the PK/PD profile.  
The number of additional samples taken will depend on the body weight and health status of the patient. 
Sampling schedule will be proposed by t he 
Sponsor and discussed with the Investigator.  
9 STUDY SCIENTIFIC OVERSIGHT  
A Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) composed of international experts in pediatric rheumatology as 
well as in HLH has been involved in the preparation of study design and protocol writing. 
The SSC is also to be consulted for t he composition of the independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(iDMC).  
The SSC will continue to play an advisory role throughout the course of the study, including the support 
to the iDMC oversight, and w i
ll perform evaluations of the data to support the Sponsor in the 
interpretation of the results of the study.  
Please refer to Appendix C  for full details of membership of the SSC.

10.1 INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE 
The iDMC, composed of relevant experts (pediatric rheumatologist, pediatric onco-hematologist with 
experience in HLH, pediatri c 
immunodeficiency/infectious disease specialist, bio-statistician and a 
specialist in ethics), will over see the study, with particular regard to the evaluation of safety parameters 
and benefit/risk profile of emapalumab, reviewing all data generated on an ongoing basis with the aim to 
ensure that patients are not exposed to unnecessary risks.  Some of the iDMC members have been already

details on the iDMC. 
10.2 DESCRIP
TION OF SAFETY PARAMETERS 
Evaluation of emapalumab toler ab
ility and safety will be based on the following parameters: 
 Adverse events (AEs), with special attention being paid to potential infusion related reactions 
(IRRs), (i.e events occ u
rring during or within [ADDRESS_1067826] infusion) and to the occurrence of 
infections, particularly with pathogens associated with lack of IFNγ biological activity (due to 
emapalumab mode of action ). 
 Laboratory parameters, as described in Section 8.4    
 Vital signs, as descr i
bed in Section 8.3.1  
 Physical examination w
ith particular attention paid to evolution of signs and symptoms present at 
baseline, and to any emerge nt
 new signs or symptoms (see Section 8.3.2  for more details).  
10.3 RECORDING AND REPORTING SAFETY PARAMETERS  
10.3.1   Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) are def
ined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during the study, 
whether or not considered rel a
ted to the IMP. All AEs reported by [CONTACT_777533]/her relatives or 
observed by [CONTACT_777534].   
Medical conditions present at screening (before ICF signature) should be recorded in the medical history 
section of the CRF. 
All AEs wil l
 be reported in the appropriate section of the CRF. 
An AE which occurs between start of screening visit (after ICF signature) and start of first IMP 
administration will be consider ed
 as a pre-treatment AE.  
Any AE that occurs after the start of the first IMP administration will be considered in the study as 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Event  (
TEAE). 
However, if a pre-existing medical condition recorded in the medical history worsens (clinically significant change in int e 
nsity or frequency), it must be recorded as an AE in the CRF and, depending on 
the time of its occurrence, will be considered as a pre-treatment AE or a TEAE. If a medical condition, recorded as a pre-treatment AE, worsens it will be recorded in the CRF as a separate TEAE. 
For each AE, the following will be assessed and recorded: intensity, relationship to the IMP, action taken 
regarding the IMP, any treatment rec ei 
ved for the event and outcome of AE to date.  
Intensity of AEs will be graded on a three-points scale (mild, moderate, severe) using the modified WHO (World Health Organiza t 
ion) toxicity scale (Grade 3 and 4 are considered to be the severe grade). If AE 
severity cannot be assessed by [CONTACT_777535], assessment by [CONTACT_777536]: 
• Mild: discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal activity, 
• Moderate: discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, 
• Severe: inability to work or perform normal daily activity.

Protocol NI-0501- 06                              Version 2.0 US – [ADDRESS_1067827] grade (on the 3 points scale 
mentioned above) reported during its course (except when the intensity of a pre-treatment AE increases 
after treatment initiation, as indicated above).  
The relationship of the AE to the IMP will be assessed by [CONTACT_12214] a “Yes/No” 
classification. A “Yes” r e
lationship infers that there is a reasonable possibility of causal relationship 
between the AE and IMP. The expression “reasonable possibility” is meant to convey that there are facts, evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. Conversely, a “No” relationship infers that there is no reasonable possibility of causal relationship between the AE and IMP. Usually it implies that other 
possible causes have been identified.  
In this study emapalumab is the only IMP. 
 Abnormal laboratory findings should be reported as AEs if requiring specific treatment. Exception to this  
is the onset of any new or w
orsened a bnormal laboratory finding s [e.g. cytopenias (all three lines), 
abnormalities denoting liver dysfunction, coagulopathy, abnormal ferritin, fibrinogen and triglyceride 
levels] indicative of an HLH/MA S reactivation or worsening: in this specific instance , the reactivation or 
worsening of HLH/MAS must be reported as the AE  and not the abnormal laboratory findings, even if 
requiring intervention .  
 If an abnormal laboratory finding leads to a new diagnosis, this diagnosis should be reported as AE (e.g. hyperglycaemia leading to di ag
nosis of diabetes mellitus).  
 
10.3.2  Serious Adverse Events 
An adverse event is considered s er
ious if it: 
 results in death (note: death is an outcome, not an event); 
 is life-threatening; (note: the term "life-threatening" refers to an event in which the patient 
was at immediate risk  
of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe); 
 requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_777481]; 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
 is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or requir e 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_400093], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
For the purposes of this study, the following will not be considered as serious adverse events: 
 Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_184016] a result of a patient’s pre-existing 
condition(s) which  
has (have) not worsened since receiving IMP. Such events should still be 
recorded as adverse events in the CRF; 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_777482]. 
Any serious adverse event (
SAE) that occurs during the course of the study, irrespective of the treatment 
received by [CONTACT_387475] d 
regardless of causality to the study drug, must be communicated by [CONTACT_777537], by [CONTACT_777538], within 24 hours of awareness.

Protocol NI-0501- 06  Version 2.0 US – [ADDRESS_1067828] informati on for SAE reporting: 
- 
E-mail: 
Relevant follow-up information on SAEs should be forwarded to Sobi AG as soon as it becomes 
available. In addition, the Investigator should answer without delay any request for follow-up information 
or questions Sobi AG team may have regarding the reported SAE. 
All SAEs must be recorded as an AE in the CRF. They should be reviewed, evaluated and followed 
through to resolution (or stabiliz
ation) by [CONTACT_737] . 
For any new SAE, the following minimum information is required in the initial report: 
Clear identification of the Investigator, with full contact [CONTACT_777539]
Subject’s identification details (study number, site number, subject’s unique study identificationnumber and date of birth),
IMP admini st
ration details (dose and dates)
Diagnosis of the event (or a brief description of signs/symptoms/clinical course, if the diagnosis
is not available) and the date of on se
t,
Seriousness criteria.
In addition causal relationship 
(Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) of the event with the IMP or with the study 
procedure (e.g. the causality ac cor
ding to the Investigator during screening) should be provided whenever 
possible in this initial report, otherwise it must be included in a follow-up report.  
The Sponsor will also conduct its own assessment on seriousness and causality of all recorded AEs 
during the study. If the Sponsor  
becomes aware of an AE, which has not been reported by [CONTACT_776377], but is assessed by [CONTACT_777540] (e.g. medically important), the Investigator  will be asked to report such AEs to the Sponsor as  an SAE, according to the timelines and 
rules described above.  
10.3.3   S[LOCATION_003]R reporting 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse r
eactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are adverse events that are both serious and 
unexpected (i.e. as per the In v
estigator’s Brochure), and are considered, by [CONTACT_223493], to have a reasonable possibility of causal relationship between the administered IMP and the 
adverse event.  
Some of the SAEs reported by [CONTACT_777541], and such need to be reported in 
an expedited manner by [CONTACT_13099] r
 to Health Authorities and Central Ethics Committees/Independent 
Ethics Committees/ Research Ethics Boards.  
Under 21 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 312.32(c), the Sponsor (directly or through a delegated third 
party) is required to notif
y the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and all participating Investigators in 
an IND safety report (i.e., 7- or 15-day expedited report) of potentially serious risks from clinical trials or any other source as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor receives the 
safety information and determines that the information qualifies for reporting.

Protocol NI-0501- 06                              Version 2.0 US – 7 January 2020         CONFIDENTIAL Investigators in the US are required to promptly report to the IRB all unanticipated problems involving 
risk to human subjects or others, including AEs that should be considered unanticipated problems (21 
CFR 312.66), such as IND safety reports. 
For Canada, the sponsor is required to inform Health Canada of any serious, unexpected adverse drug 
reaction that has occur r
ed inside or outside Canada. An adverse drug report must be filed in the cases 
where the adverse drug reaction is neither fatal nor life-threatening, within 15 days after becoming aware of the information, within 7 days where it is fatal or life-threatening, immediately where possible and, in any event, after becoming aware of the information.  
10.4  FOLLOW -UP OF SAFETY PARAMET ERS  
10.4.1   Treatment and Follow-up of Adverse Events 
Adverse events, especially  
those for which the relationship to the study drug has been assessed as ‘Yes’, 
should be followed-up until the ev
ent has returned to baseline status or has stabilised . If a clear 
explanation is established, it should be recorded on the CRF.  
All SAEs must be followed-up until the event has either resolved or reached a stable clinical outcome. 
10.4.[ADDRESS_1067829] be reported to Sobi AG within 24 
hours of awareness. This inc
ludes pregnancies occurring in partners of male enrolled patients. All 
information pertaining to the pregnancy should be reported using the Sobi AG Pregnancy form provided to the investigators. Pregnancies should be followed until conclusion to obtain outcome information. 
Occurrence of a pregnancy in a study participant will preclude any further IMP administration.  
If the patient is withdrawn from the study, the assessments presented in the Schedule of Assessments for 
EoS are to be performed (see Sec 
tion 8.9 ). 
10.5 BENEFIT/RISK MANAGEMENT 
10.5.1  Safety Surveillance Management - iDMC 
The main responsibility  
of the iDMC is to review all safety and efficacy data as they are generated to 
ensure that no patient is ex pose
d to unnecessary risk and to continuously assess the benefit/risk profile of 
emapalumab. 
The iDMC can recommend treatment discontinuation for individual patients as well as to halt the entire 
study temporarily or permanent
ly. Predefined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_777483]. For 
more details, see stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_112576] 11. 
10.5.2   General Benefit/Risk Considerations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Potential benefits 
Patients pr
esenting MAS secondary to sJIA may not respond to systemic glucocorticoids and have 
limited alternative t h
erapeutic options. These options are represented by [CONTACT_777542], and administration of CsA or chemotherapy such as etoposide, all options carrying an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. For those non-responders patients, an alternate therapy should aim to obtain remission of MAS with none or limited safety issues.   
Three elements strongly suggest that the use of emapalumab would enable MAS remission: 
Page 52 of 150
Study NI- 0501- 06 Emapalumab in MAS/sHLH in sJIA/AOSD patients Page 52 of 76 
Protocol NI-0501- 06                              Version 2.0 US – 7 January 2020         CONFIDENTIAL - In animal model mimicking MAS, administration of an anti-IFNγ enables the recovery/remission of 
the signs and symptoms associated with hypercytokinemia  
- Observational studies have shown a strong correlation between biomarkers (IFNγ as well as IFNγ- 
induced c
hemokines) and disease parameters at MAS onset and during disease evolution. 
According to the data collected to date  in pHLH patients (ongoing NI -0501 -04 study),  emapalumab  
administration has shown the potential to improve or resolve relevant clinical and laboratory 
abnormalities of HLH, including CNS signs and symptoms when present, allowing pa tients to proceed to 
HSCT .  
For more details refer to the latest Investigator’s Brochure . 
Based on these considerations, sJIA patients with MAS having inadequately responded to systemic high 
dose glucocorticoids are expect ed 
to benefit from a targeted therapy with emapalumab aiming at 
neutralizing IFN γ and achieving MAS remission.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risks analysis 
 Risks related t o 
emapalumab  
emapalumab is a fully human Ig G
1monoclonal antibody (mAb). 
Upon the administration of mAbs, which are proteins, acute infusion reactions can occur. These may happen during the infusion or  
in the subsequent hours (usually within the first 24 hours) (Kang SP 2007, 
Maggi E 2011) .  
These reactions are either IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylactic reactions), or anaphylactoid reactions not  
mediated by [CONTACT_29763]. True anaphylactic reactions usually do not occur upon 
initial infusion and require a certain sensitization. In contrast, the pathophysiology of anaphylactoid reactions appears to be secondary to the release of cytokines consequent to a mAb binding to circulating antigen-expressing cells. However, the clinical manifestations of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions overlap, and both may lead to life-threatening conditions, involving cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
central nervous, gastro-intestinal, and cutaneous systems. The management of anaphylactic and 
anaphylactoid reactions involves immediate administration of oxygen, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], vasopressors, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and/or antihistamines.  
More than [ADDRESS_1067830] been administered to HLH patients (either in the context of the NI-0501-[ADDRESS_1067831] received emapalumab in compassionate use) up to and 
including the dose of 10 mg/kg, without any serious or severe infusion related reaction reported. In less than 2% of infusions, mild or moderate transient erythematous rashes localized to the extremities (feet and/or hands) have been reported in a few patients. They occurred in most of the cases during the first infusions of emapalumab and resolved spontaneously. When administration of emapalumab has been 
performed occasionally through a peripheral venous access, infusions were all uneventful.  
In the population intended to be enrolled in the study, the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_777484]. All patients enrolled in this 
study will continue to receive glucocorticoids concomitantly, and will be monitored during and after the infusion. 
When administered to humans, most mAb therapeutics elicit some level of antibody response (anti-drug 
antibodies or ADAs) agai nst 
 the therapeutic product, as early as after the first exposure. No sign of 
immunogenicity has been reported in the emapalumab study in healthy volunteers. The presence of ADAs  will be measured during this study as per regulatory recommendations, and the analysis is planned 
to be performed at the end of the NI-0501-06 study, unless PK or safety concerns possibly related to

Protocol NI-0501- 06                              Version 2.0 US – 7 January 2020         CONFIDENTIAL immunogenicity would justify an interim analysis.  Data accumulated so far (in particular PK profiles and 
a negative ADA search performed in the first pHLH patient treated with emapalumab) have not led to 
suspect the presence of ADA. 
 Risks related to the target 
The impact on the immun
e defense  caused by [CONTACT_184067]γ is known from patien ts with 
inborn errors of the IL -12/23 -IFN-γ circuit, particularly patients with complete or partial IFNγ receptor 
(R) deficiency, and subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_184019] -IFNγ antibodies . 
Patients with IFNγ R deficiency are prone to developi[INVESTIGATOR_653400], although to a 
lesser extent, Salmonell a 
infections (Dorman SE 2000, Jouanguy E 1997) . The mean ag e of the first 
environmental mycobacterial i nfection is 3.1 and 13.4 years in patients with complete and partial 
deficiency, respectively  (Remus N 2001) . No systematic prophylaxi s has been recommended in these 
patients.  
If an infection occurs, appropriate antibiotherapy based on sensitivity of isolated species is prescribed. Individuals with anti -IFNγ auto-antibodies are also susceptible to deve lop mycobacterial infections (for 
the vast majority atypi[INVESTIGATOR_184020]), but also opportunistic infections (e.g. by [CONTACT_184068], S almonella , Herpes  Zoster  virus  infections ) (Browne SK 2012) .   
Toxicological studies  
carried out with emapalumab have shown an increased susceptibility of the 
monkeys having received em apa
lumab to enteral pathogen infections when the pathogen is present into 
the intestinal tract prior to emapalumab administration. Presence of infections due to Shigella, Salmonella 
and Campylobacter  is part of the exclusion criteria. 
A reactivation of Herpes Zoster  virus aft er  the single emapalumab infusion at 3 mg/kg, was observed in 
one healthy volunteer in the NI-0510-03 study with a non-uneventful course and full recovery.   
Preliminary data on infections collected in patients treated with emapalumab to date allow the following 
conclusions to be drawn:   
- Active inf e
ctions, in particular bacterial and viral infections (among them EBV or CMV infections, 
which are often the trig g
er of the HLH), were present at the first administration of emapalumabin 
some of them. During emapalumab administration these infections resolved with appropriate 
antimicrobial treatment and while achieving control of HLH. 
‐ Some HLH patients treated in second line after immune-chemotherapy developed infections during 
the course of emapalumab t
reatment. A long and profound generalized immune suppression caused by 
[CONTACT_777543] a higher risk for infection development. However in the presence of a satisfactory control of HLH, and upon 
appropriate anti-microbial treatment, infections have usually resolved. 
‐ Patients treated in first line or after a limited exposure to glucocorticoids or chemotherapy seem to 
develop less infections du r 
ing the course of emapalumab.  
‐ Systematic search for tuberculosis was negative and no atypi[INVESTIGATOR_184022]. Stool/bl ood 
cultures were negative for Salmonella , Shigella  or Campylobacter  in all 
patients. No Herpes Zoster  infection has been reported. 
‐ Only one infection reported (disseminated histoplasmosis in a patient with a severely compromised 
immune status and suspect ed 
to carry the pathogen prior to the administration of emapalumab) was 
reported as a serious adverse reaction as it is one of the few pathogens known to be favored by [CONTACT_20129] γ 
neutralization. However the patient recovered from it rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777485].

previous HLH treatments, seemed to contribute significantly to the development of infections. 
For more details refer to the latest Investigator’s Brochure .  
 Risk related to the study population 
Most of the patients ar e 
expected to have already received at least glucocorticoid treatments as well as 
having possibly been previously  
treated by [CONTACT_777544][INVESTIGATOR_014], some of them for a relatively long 
time depending on the duration of their underlying rheumatic disease; therefore they may carry variable 
degree of toxicities caused by [CONTACT_184069] . The data collected to date in pHLH patients who have 
been heavily pretreated by [CONTACT_44859]-chemotherapy show that administration of emapalumab does not aggravate toxicities of previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_777486], in general, a favorable impact on HLH activity.  
All information collected on disease severity and prev i
 ous treatments will be taken into account for the 
analysis of adverse events.  
Toxicities of concomitant treatments, authorized or recommended during the administration of 
emapalumab, may also potent i
ally expose the patients to adverse events; however their benefits may 
outweigh their risks. No safety concern related to the concomitant administration of emapalumab  with 
other treatments (e.g., antimicrobial agents, anti -hypertensive drugs) has been reported so far. 
Corticosteroids  have already been administered with anti-IFNγ therapy in Crohn’s Disease without any 
particular safety concerns  (Reinisch W 2010 ). Of interest, taperi ng of glucocorticoids had no impact on 
safety and tolerability of emapalumab  infusions and has shown benefit for patients with steroids -related 
hypertension and generalized immunosuppression.  
Although the risk that the emapalumab treatment will not be able to control the disease may exist, the close monitoring and the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_777487], in this event, emapalumab treatment will 
be discontinued and the patients will rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777488]. The risks of administering alternate therapy after having received 
emapalumab seems to be low, since no particular safety concerns were observed during treatment with 
emapalumab. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risk minimization measures 
In
 view of the expected benefits and previous experience gathered with patients exposed to emapalumab 
the above listed risks are cons i
dered to be manageable in this patient population, if adequate 
minimization measures are put in place. An overview of specific measures to minimize the subject’s risk 
is provided below: 
 Study designed with rheumatologists experienced in the treatment of sJIA and MAS, forming 
the SSC. 
 Patients are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] i
n specialized centers for the treatment of MAS, and therefore with 
all necessary emergency assi s
tance equipment. 
 Inclusion/exclusion criteria: patients with malformations or severely altered functions (either 
due to the disease stage or
 to a concomitant disease), as well as patients with evidence of 
patent or latent TB infections  or active mycobacteria , Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter,  
Histoplasma Capsulatum or Leishmania  infections, will not be included in the study (for 
details see Section 4.1 ).  
 Although unlikely to be observed based on preliminary results gathered from patients treated 
with emapalumab up to 10m g
/kg, Infusion Related Reactions (IRRs) will be detected and 
managed in due time through patients’ monitoring during and after drug infusions. Each of 
the specialized centers will have physicians adequately trained in IRR management.

11 STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_16442] 
11.1 AT PATIENT LEVEL 
11.1.1  Investigator’s or Patient’s  Decision to Discontinue 
An Investigator can decide at any time during the study to discontinue the treatment for an individual 
patient based on his/her o w
n medical judgment, taking into account the individual benefit risk ratio for 
his/her patient. In addition, the patient (or their legal representative) can decide at any time to withdraw from the study.  
In any case the decision to withdraw or be withdrawn will have no impact on the patient’s care and 
further treatments administ er 
ed to him/her after withdrawal.  
Patients who are withdrawn from the study will receive alternative treatments according to the standard 
of care at the site. 
 
11.1.2  Deci s
ion to Discontinue Treatment due to Safety Reason or Lack of Efficacy 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatm ent Discontinuation f or a Safety Reason 
A patient must be discontinued from study treatment if a SAE occurring after emapalumab administration 
is: 
1. considered by [CONTACT_777546] g
ator to be rel a ted to emapalumab  (with guidance from the iDMC if 
needed)  
AND  
2. is a life-threatening event. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  All other related SAEs will be judged by [CONTACT_109813] a case-by-case basis taking into account the disease e vol 
ution (such as signs of improvement in HLH) and the 
possibility of managing the S AE and ensuring that no patient is exposed to 
unnecessary risks. Treatment Discontinuation for Lack of Efficacy 
A patient should be discontinued from study treatment for lack of efficacy in the event of any of the followings:

therapeutic alternatives, t h
e iDMC can authorize it after a thorough review of the patient’s data and 
confirmation of lack of risks for the patient.  
11.1.3  Systemic and local reaction to emapalumab infusion 
In case of clinical r el
evant changes in vital signs compared to pre-infusion values, the rate of 
emapalumab infusion may be dec
reased or the infusion temporarily interrupted, if deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_737].  
A decision to definitely stop the infusion should only be taken in case of very severe systemic reactions 
and be based on the evolution of 
patient status after appropriate symptomatic measures, e.g. oxygenation, 
and upon physician’s own medical judgment.  
All changes in the infusion rate should be recorded on the Infusion Worksheet: each t i me with the rate 
modification.  
Unless related to a hypersensitivity reaction, the occurrence of local issues related to the infusion (such as 
catheter displacement, obstructi on o
r product extravasation) should be managed through the identification 
of a new venous access as soon as possible to complete the infusion. All relevant information needs to be 
recorded in the Infusion Worksheet, including the volume of IMP potentially lost (in order to calculate 
the quantity of drug infused), and the time at which the infusion was stopped and restarted.  
11.2 AT STUDY LEVEL 
11.2.1  Suspension of  Recruitment 
Recruitm ent
 may be suspended in the following situations: 
 Any occurrence of death or life-threatening SAE related to the drug  
 At the iDMC’s own request as an outcome of the i r regular study review. 
Patients already enrolled in the study should continue receiving emapalumab as per protocol unless decided otherwise by [CONTACT_777547] i 
gator. 
The suspension will allow the iDMC to analyse  the data already generated and consider a 
recommendation.  
After re-evaluation of benefit/risk profile, the iDMC may recommend any of the following:  
 To resume recruitment without any change 
 To implement minimisation  measures t hat may require protocol amendment  
 To implement conditions for study termination, e.g. next occurrence of a particular serious drug 
reaction or at the next pati
ent worsening or reactivation 
11.2.2  Study Termination 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Study Termination f or 
Safety Reason 
Occurrence of two deat h
s suggesting a reasonably possible relationship with continuous exposure to 
emapalumab and occurring in simi l
ar conditions will trigger the decision to terminate the study.

enrolled in the study will also be part of the iDMC recommendations . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Termination for Absence of a Demonstrat ed Benefit  
The decision to t er
minate the study due to absence of a demonstrated benefit will be one of the 
responsibilities of the  
iDMC, based on the ongoing review of the individual patient data and benefit/risk 
analysis. 
In case of study termination, the management of the patients already enrolled in the study will also be 
part of the iDMC recommendati
ons. 
12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN 
Full details of all planned analyses will be specified in separate documents describing PK/PD and Statistical Analyses, which will be finalized prior to the locking of the study database. This section 
contains an overview of the planned methods of analysis with regard to safety and efficacy variables. 
12.1 SAMPLE SIZE   
Approximately 12 patient s
 (a minimum of 10 sJIA patients) will be enrolled across North America and 
Europe. The sample size is based on 
pragmatic considerations, and on the experience acquired from 
primary HLH patients treated with emapalumab. 
12.2 ANALYSIS SETS   
All analysis sets wil l
 be defined prior to final database closure. In addition to the analysis sets listed 
below, further exploratory anal
yses may be performed using other subgroups of patients. 
12.2.1  Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set w i
ll include all patients who receive any part of an infusion of study drug. 
12.2.2  Intent- to-Treat Analysis Set 
The in t
ent-to-treat (ITT) analysis se t  will coincide with the Safety Analysis Set. 
12.2.[ADDRESS_1067833] 
deviation, minimum and maximu m
 values. For binary data (proportions of patients showing a defined 
variable) the numbers and percentages will be tabulated.  
All study variables are considered to be exploratory in this study, and no hierarchy of endpoints has been 
specified, as the objectiv e
 of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_777490].

splenomegaly; WBC; pl at
elet counts; liver function test (in particular ALT/AST); fibrinogen; ferritin; 
LDH.  
For binary endpoints (MAS remission by [CONTACT_10585] 8, number of patients who taper glucocorticoids, number 
of patients who discontinu e due t
o lack of efficacy), 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for 
proportions. 
For time to event endpoints (time to MAS remission, time to achievement of glucocorticoids tapering and 
time to death), Kaplan-Me
ier curves will be calculated and summary statistics, such as medians, 
proportions event-free at various time points will be calculated and presented, and 95% confidence intervals calculated where possible.  
12.3.[ADDRESS_1067835]. 
In addition, other exploratory analyses of safety data, including summaries for different subsets of 
patients, may be conducted. 
12.3.3  Pharmacodyn a
mic Data 
All PD data will be summar i
zed using appropriate graphical and tabular presentations. 
Exploratory statistical models will be fitted, and correlation analyses undertaken, to investigate the 
relationships between PD d at
a and clinical measures of response. ROC curves may be used to summarize 
any relationships that are found. 
In addition, other exploratory analyses of pharmacodynamic endpoints, including summaries for different 
subsets of patients, may be conducted. 
12.3.4  Imm
unogenicity Data 
The numbers of patients with ant
i-drug antibodies present at each assessment point will be summarized. 
12.3.5  Missing Data 
No imputations of missi ng
 data will be performed. However, the following rules will be applied to ensure 
that all patients can be incl uded i
n the final analysis:  
- patients who are withdrawn from the study prior to Week 8 because of safety concerns or 
poor efficacy will be cl
assified as non-responders from the time of their withdrawal in all

to-event analyses. For continuous endpoints in such patients, all analyses for time points 
beyond the point of withdrawal will exclude missing data for these patients. 
12.4 INTERIM ANALYSIS 
No interim analysis is planned. 
12.5 WITHDRAWAL AND REPLACEMENT   
12.5.1  P
atients 
Additional patients wil l
 be recruited into the study if patients are withdrawn from the study for reasons 
other than safety or l a
ck of efficacy to ensure a sample size of approximately 12 patients across North 
America an d Europe. 
12.5.2  For Centers 
Centers may be closed down f
or the following administrative reasons: excessively slow recruitment, poor 
protocol adherence.

Protocol NI-0501- 06                              Version 2.0 US – [ADDRESS_1067836], evaluation, and documentation of 
this study are designed to ens
ure that Sobi AG, its authori zed representative, and Investigator abide by 
[CONTACT_23663] (GCP), as described in International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles grounded  in the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The study w ill receive approval from an IRB/ IEC prior to commencement and where applicable 
by [CONTACT_772522]. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the pe rtinent regulatory authorities.  
13.2 INVESTIGATOR’S RESPON SIBILITIES 
The Investigator  
must ensure that all persons assisting with the trial are appropriately qualified and 
adequately informed about the pr
otocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study- related duties 
and functions and should ensure this is appropriately documented in the site file. The Investigator should maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has 
delegated significant study-related duties. 
The Investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all patients (or their legally authorised  
representative) who  sign an informed consent document and are screened for entry into the study. 
Patients who fail screening must have the reason(s) recorded in their source documents and the study -
screening log.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigators’ staff, must be available dur i
 ng monitoring 
visits, audits and inspections to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to patients’ records 
(e.g. medical/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study related charts) for source data and 
other type of verification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and 
queries. The Investigator must make himself/herself personally available during at least one monitoring 
visit per month, in order to address questions and to generally demonstrate his/her direct oversight of the conduct of the study. 
The Investigator must allow regular visits at the site when patients are enrolled, to be not less than one [ADDRESS_1067837] 30 days after a study day. 
13.3 CONSENT 
Before being admitted to t
he clinical study, the patient or the patient’s legally  authorized representative 
must consent to participate after the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the clinical study have 
been explained in a manner understandable to him or her. An informed consent document that includes 
both information about the study and the consent form will be prepared and given to the patient. This document will contain all ICH, GCP, and locally required regulatory elements (whichever is more 
stringent). The informed consent will be translated in a language understandable to the patient, as 
required by [CONTACT_777548], and must specify who informed the patient, and when the informed consent was obtained.  
Page 61 of 150
Study NI- 0501- 06 Emapalumab in MAS/sHLH in sJIA/AOSD patients Page 61 of 76 
Protocol NI-0501- 06                              Version 2.0 US – 7 January 2020         CONFIDENTIAL Information to patients will be split into a Patient Information Sheet that provides detailed information 
about the trial and its benefits and risks, and the Informed Consent Form that summarises  the content of 
the Patient Information Sheet and is used to obtain the dated signature [CONTACT_184101]’s agreement  to partake in the study.  
If applicable, since minors are involved in the trial, assent must be obtained from the minor and informed 
consent from at least one of the pa
rents or as mandated by [CONTACT_184074] (individual or judicial or other body 
authori zed under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective patient to the patient’s participation 
in the procedures involved in the research). The language used in the Assent Form is adapted to the 
maturity level of the minor involved in the trial. Since mino rs of different age groups are likely to be 
entered into the trial different versions of the Assent Form will be provided. The modalities for obtaining 
informed consent from the parents and Assent from the minor will be defined at the site initiation visit  
and documented at the clinical trial center. 
The Investigator, or designee, will obtain consent for participation in the study in writing . The written 
informed consent will be obtained prior to conducting any study -related procedures or tests , although 
procedures or tests that are done as a part of routine medical care and conducted before consent can be 
used for the purposes of screening . The patient’s consent (or the consent of the patient’s legally 
authori zed representative) must be confirmed at the tim e of consent by [CONTACT_777549]. A copy of the signed consent document must be given to the patient or their legally authori zed representative. The Investigator  will retain the origin al 
signed consent document.  
If an amended protocol impacts the content of the informed consent document, the consent document 
must be revised. Patients a l 
ready participating in the study when the amended protocol is implemented 
must be re-consented with the revised version of the informed consent document , if the changes impact 
the continued participation of that patient . A copy of the revised informed consent document must be 
given to the patient or their legally authorised  representative. The Investigato r will retain the original 
signed updated consent document in the study files. 
13.4 CONFIDENTIALITY AND DATA PRIVACY 
Sobi AG affirms the pati en
t's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in compliance with 
ICH and other local regul at
ions (whichever is more stringent). Sobi AG requires the Investigator to 
permit Sobi AG representatives and when necessary, representatives from regulatory authorities, to 
review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws (any copi[INVESTIGATOR_190213]’ records must be duly anonymi zed to protect patients’ confidentiality).  
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorisation  separate from the patient’s 
statement of informed consent, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in 
writing from the appropriate individual.  
13.5 PROTOCOL AMENDME NTS  
Substantial amendments will  
be submitted to the IRB/IEC for written approval and where applicable to 
National Competent Authori t
ies. Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the 
amended version occurs unless the amendment is implemented to increase safety measures for the 
patients in the study. The written signed approval from the IRB/ IEC should specifically reference the 
Principal Investigator’s name, protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is/are applicable.

Before the start of the study, the study protocol, informed consent document, and any other appropriate 
documents will be submitted t o 
the IRB/IEC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents 
submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which 
approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorities in accordance 
with local legal requirements. 
Sobi AG can only supply study drug to an Investigator after Sobi AG or their authorised  representative 
has received documentation on all ethical and legal requirements for starting the study. This 
documentation must also include a list of the members of the IRB/IEC and their occupation and 
qualifications. If the IRB/ IEC will not disclose the names of the committee members, it should be asked 
to issue a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. Formal 
approval by [CONTACT_1201]/ IEC should  preferably  mention the study title, study code, study site, and any other 
documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be officially 
signed by a committee member (chairman or secretary of the IRB/ IEC). Before the first patient is 
enrolled at a given  study  site, all ethical and legal requirements must be met.  
The IRB/IEC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol amendments 
in accordance with local legal  r
equirements. Amendments must be evaluated to determine whether formal 
approval must be sought and whether the informed consent document should also be revised. 
The Investigator must keep a record of all communication with the IRB/IEC and, if applicable, between a 
coordinating Investigator
 [INVESTIGATOR_72616]/IEC. This statement also applies to any communication between 
the Investigator (or coordinating Investigator, if applicable) and regulatory authorities. 
All documents handed over to patients or their legal representative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_777550] R
egulatory Authorities and to IRB/IEC. This includes but is not limited to 
the informed consent form, patient information sheet, assent form, advertisements, training materials, etc. 
13.7 ONGOING INFORMATION FOR IRB/IEC 
If required by [CONTACT_777551]  t
he IRB/IEC, the investigator  must submit to the IRB/ IEC: 
 Information on SAEs or S[LOCATION_003]Rs as per local applicable rules and timelines;  
 Periodic reports on the progress of the study; 
 Deviations from the protocol or anything that may involve added risk to patient s. 
13.8 CLOSURE OF THE STUDY 
Sobi AG reserves the rig ht
 to terminate this study at any time for reasonable medical or administrative 
reasons. Any premature disc ont
inuation will be appropriately documented according to local 
requirements (e.g ., IRB/IEC, Regulatory Authorities).  
In addition, the Investigator or Sobi AG has the right to discontinue a single site at any time during the 
study for medical or administrat
ive reasons such as: 
 Lack of screening or recruiting activities  
 Significant non-compliance with contractual enrolment timelines and targets 
 Persistent GCP non-compliance 
 Inaccurate, incomplete or delayed data collection 
 Persistent failure to adhere to the study protocol 
 Persistent failure to provide requested follow-up information for data queries

15.1 DOCUMENTATION OF STUDY RESULTS 
A CRF (including electronic data capture) is used in this study and a specific CRF will correspond to 
each patient.  
All required in f
ormation must be entered on the CRFs. If an item is not available or is not applicable, this 
fact should be indicated a n
d no blank spaces must be left. The data collected on the CRF will be entered 
into the study database. If the investigator authorises  other personnel to enter data into the CRF, the 
names, positions, signatures, and initials of these persons must be supplied to Sobi AG  or their authorised  
representative before these individuals start  completing CRF information.  
The CRF must be reviewed by [CONTACT_184083] a designated sub-
investigator, and final si g
nature will be required.  
15.2 USE OF COMPUTERI ZED SYS TEMS AT TH E CLINICAL TRIAL CENT ER 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computeriz ed medical record 
system
 (i.e. in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document 
if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to 
computeriz ed systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computeriz ed data collection system 
allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain 
a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_25773], and date of the change. 
The system must allow the clinical research associate, auditors or inspectors to verify source data without 
infringing privacy ri g 
hts of other patients, e.g. access must be restricted to records pertaining to the study 
patients and access to other patients must not be possible.

DEVELOPMENT OF TREATMENT PLANS (DESIGNED BY [CONTACT_777556]) 
 (DeWitt EM 2012 ) 
Patient should have:  
 1. Age [ADDRESS_1067844] 2 weeks  
 3. Arthritis2 in one or more joints (6 weeks duration not required)  
 4. At least one of the following:  
      a. Evanescent erythematous rash  
      b. Generalized lymphadenopathy  
      c. Hepatomegaly or splenomegaly  
      d. Pericarditis, pleuritis and/or peritonitis  
Patient should not have any of the following:  
 1. Infection:  including concomitant active or recurrent chronic bacterial, fungal 
or viral infection at presentation; nor underlying infection which may mimic 
initial presentation of sJIA3 
 2.  Malignancy3   
 3. Positive screening test for TB without documented past treatment  
 4. Prior treatment for SJIA other than NSAIDs or short term steroids4 
 5. Immunization with live  virus vaccines within the [ADDRESS_1067845] at some point exhibit a quotidian fever pattern, defined as fever 
that rises to ≥39°C at least once a day and returns to ≤37°C between fever peaks.  
2Swelling within a joint, or limitation in the range of joint movement with joint pain or tenderness, is 
observed by a physician, and which is not due to primarily mechanical disorders or to other identifiable 
causes.  
3 Infections, malignancy and other diagnoses which can present with similar symptoms as sJIA should be 
excluded before initiating treatment plans for new onset sJIA in order to avoid unintended adverse 
effects of the treatment plans if used for other diagno ses. 
4 Prior treatment with steroids should not exceed 2 weeks of oral steroids, and/or 3 pulses of 
methylprednisolone. Prior treatment with IVIG for possible Kawasaki Disease is allowed. Duration of 
NSAIDs is without restriction.  
 
NOTE: The above is not m eant to represent diagnostic nor classification criteria for sJIA. The 
differences between this operational case definition and the ILAR criteria are:  
‐ ILAR specifies that the duration of quotidian  fever has to be 3 days (the total duration of fever is 
two weeks in both) . 
‐ ILAR specifies six weeks’ duration of arthritis . 
‐ Psoriasis, positive RF, arthritis in HLA B27 positive male after 6 years of age, family history of 
AS, IBD with sacroiliitis, acute anterior uveitis and reactive arthritis are listed as exclusions in 
the ILAR definition .

STILL’S DISEASE  
(Yamaguchi M 1992 ) 
 
Classification of adult Still's disease requires 5 or more criteria including 2 or more major 
criteria1.  
Any disease listed under "Exclusions" should be excluded. 
 
Major criteria 
 Fever of 39°C or higher, lasting 1 week or longer 
 Arthralgia lasting 2 weeks or longer 
 Typi[INVESTIGATOR_777492]2 
 Leukocytosis (10.000/mm3 or grea t er) including 80% more of granulocytes 
 
Minor criteria 
 Sore throat 
 Lymphadenopathy and/or splenomega ly3 
 Liver dysfunction4 
 Negative RF and negative ANA5 
 Exclusions 
 Infections (especially, sepsis and infectious mononucleosis)  
 Malignancies (especially, malignant lymphoma) 
 Rheumatic diseases (especially, polyarteritis nodosa and rheumatoid vasculitis with 
extraarticular featur es
) 
 
1. All criteria are applicable only in absence of other clinical explanations.  
2. Macular or maculopapular nonpruritic salmon-pi[INVESTIGATOR_777493]. 
3. Lymphadenopathy is defined as recent development of significant lymph node swelling, and splenomegaly 
is confirmed on palpatio n
 or by [CONTACT_777557]. 
4. Liver dysfunction is defined as an abnormally elevated level of transaminases and/or lactate 
dehydrogenase, which 
is attributed to liver damage associated with this disease but not with drug 
allergy/toxicity or other causes. For the differentiation, it is recommended to see if liver function returns to 
normal upon discontinuation of hepatotoxic drug or not, before applying this criterion. 
5. RF in serum must be negative by [CONTACT_777558], and serum ANA must be 
negative by [CONTACT_777559] m
unofluorescence test. 
RF: rheumatoid factor, ANA: antinuclear antibody.

clinical condition require s it. 
 Cyclosporin e A (CsA) may be continued if started at least 3 days 
prior to initiation of NI -0501 treatment . CsA dose adjustments are 
allowed in order to maintain therapeutic  levels.  CsA can be 
withdrawn at any time during the study, upon judgment of the 
Investigator. Cs A cannot be introduced once NI -0501  treatment  
has started . 
 If the patient is receiving intrathecal  therapy (e.g.  methotrexate and 
glucocorticoids ) at the time of NI -0501 treatment initiation, this 
treatment will be continued until clinically indicated .

 Levels  of the main IFNγ -induced chemokines  (CXCL9, CXCL10).  
 Correlation between chemokine levels (CXCL9, CXCL10) and 
levels of free NI -0501, free IFNγ  (pre-dose) and total IFNγ  
(exploratory analysis ). 
 Correlation of chemokine and total IFNγ  levels, and laboratory 
parameters of MAS severity, e.g. ferritin, platelet co unt, LFTs 
(exploratory analysis ). 
 Levels of other potential disease bio markers  (e.g. sCD25,  sCD163, 
IL-10, IL-6, IL-18, TNFCXCL11 ).  
 Levels (if any) of circulating antibodies against NI -0501 to 
determine immunogenicity (ADA ). 
In particular, based on:  
 levels of circulating NI -0501  
 levels of total IFNγ   
 levels of main IFNγ –induced chemokines  (namely CXCL9  and 
CXCL10 ) 
a PK/PD modelling will be used to confirm that the proposed dose 
regimen is adequate in relation to  the IFNγ  production in this patient 
popu lation.  
 Safety  
The tolerability  and safety of NI -0501 treatment will be assessed as 
follows:  
 Incidence, severity, causality and outcomes of AEs (serious and 
non-serious), with particular attention being paid to infections . 
 Evolution of laboratory paramet ers, in particular CBC,  LFTs , 
inflammatory markers (ferritin and CRP)  and coagulation  
parameters.  
 Number of patients withdrawn from the study due to safety 
reasons.  
 Efficacy  
A preliminary assessment of NI -0501 efficacy in this patient 
population will be  based on the following variables:  
 Number of patients achieving MAS remission by [CONTACT_10585] 8 after 
initiation of NI -0501 treatment.  
 Time to MAS remission . 
 Number of patients for whom at any time during the study  
glucocorticoids can be tapered i) to the same  (or lower)  dose being 
administered before the occurrence of MAS  ((in those patients who 
are already treated for sJIA) or ii) by 50% (or less) of the dose 
administered at NI -0501 treatment start (in those patients who 
present with MAS at sJIA onset).   
 Time to glucocorticoids tapering (as above described).  
 Survival time.  
 Number of patients withdrawn from the study due to lack of 
efficacy.

Protocol NI-0501- 06                           Version 1.0 US – October 19, 2017 CONFIDENTIAL Statistical Analysis:   All study variables  are considered to be exploratory in this study, 
and no hierarchy of endpoints has been specified, as the objective 
of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_777453] . 
Statistical methods will therefore focus on summarizing the data 
collected using descripti ve statistics  and on appropriate graphical 
presentations .  
 For binary endpoints ( MAS remission by [CONTACT_10585] 8 , number of 
patients who taper glucocorticoids , number of patients who 
discontinu e due to lack of efficacy) , 95% confidence intervals will 
be calculated  for proportions.  
 For time to event endpoints (time to MAS remission, time to 
achievement of glucocorticoids tapering and time to death) , 
Kaplan -Meier curves will be calculated and summary statistics, 
such as medians, proportions event -free at various time  points will 
be calculated and presented , and 95% confidence intervals 
calculated where possible .   
 Data relating to safety will be listed and summarised using 
descriptive statistics .

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1 NI-0501 
1.1.1 Description and mode of action 
NI-0501 is a fully human IgG1 anti-interferon gamma (IFN γ ) monoclonal antibody (mAb) which binds 
and neutralizes IFNγ. NI-0501 binds to soluble and receptor (IFNγR1)-bound forms of IFNγ.  
Since NI-[ADDRESS_1067867] associated IFN  with the pathogenesis and the maintenance 
of inflammatory diseases1–3, and m ost recently, in the pathogenesis of HLH. 
1.1.2  Preclinical Data  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-clinical Pharmacology 
NI-0501 has shown similar binding affinity and blocking activity for I FNγ from non-human speci es , 
including Rhesus and Cynomolgus monkeys, but not from dogs, cats, pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], rabbits, rats or mice.  
Due to NI-0501 capacity to bind free an d IFNγR1-bound IFNγ, studies were performed to investigate the 
potential of NI-0501 to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement 
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activities, in the presence of target. A lack of ADCC activity was demonstrated and no induction of CDC activity was observed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Toxicology 
Binding and functional da t
a demonstrated Rhesus  or Cynomolgus  monkeys to be rel ev ant species to 
evaluate the safety of NI-0501. No off-target toxicity was attributed to the drug when administered to 
Cynomolgus  monkeys in 13 weekly doses of up to 200 mg/kg. An enhanced susceptibility to infections 
due to the pharmacological effect of the drug was observed at all dose levels (10 to 200 mg/kg/week) in 
animals originally harboring gastrointestinal pathogens ( Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter ) prior to 
NI-0501 administration. In a study where Cynomolgus  monkeys were not initially found to be harboring 
gastrointestinal pathogens, weekly administrations of NI-0501 for 8 consecutive weeks at doses up to 30 
mg/kg were well tolerated, without the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.  
Results from a human tissue cross-reactivity study, involving a panel of [ADDRESS_1067868] with any of the human samples tested. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety pharmacology 
There were no abnormal f i
ndings in ECGs taken periodically during treatment and recovery periods in 
the 8 week and 13 week repea t
ed dose toxicology studies in Cynomolgus  monkeys, where animals were 
exposed to doses up to 200 mg/kg of NI-0501 weekly. No abnormal findings were observed in the histopathological investigations of the hearts and lungs in these animals compared to untreated animals. Histopathological analysis of kidneys from these animals revealed no abnormal findings and the periodic 
urinalysis readings were also normal, indicating no abnormal effects on renal function. There were no 
histopathological findings in brains in both studies. Furthermore, no abnormal behavior of the animals 
was observed throughout the study periods, suggesting no effects on CNS.

Protocol NI-0501- 06                           Version 1.0 US – October 19, 2017 CONFIDENTIAL 1.1.3  Clinical Data 
A Phase 1 randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled single ascending dose study in 20 healthy adult 
volunteers investigating t
he safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles of single intravenous (i.v. ) 
administrations of NI-0501 was conducted between September 2011 and April 2012. During this study a 
total of 14 subjects  received increasing doses of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 3 mg/kg  NI-0501 ( 3, 3, 4, and 4 
subjects , respectively), while 6 subjects  received placebo.  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis of NI-0501 revealed the expected profile for an IgG1 with a half-life 
of approx. 22 days, a slow clearance (
≤ 0.007 L/h) and a low volume of distribution (< 6 L on average). 
All NI-0501 infusions were uneventful.  
A similar incidence of commonly reported infections (e.g., upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014]) w as 
observed after administrati on of
 NI-0501 and in subjects who had received placebo.  
A Herpes Zoster (HZ) infection was reported in one subject ( ), 14 days after his infusion of 
3 mg/kg of NI-0501. This event was  as
sessed as related to the NI-0501 infusion and considered as serious 
(medically significant) in the context of a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (HV s). Its intensity was 
moderate and its course normal under antiviral therapy. The subject recovered with no sequelae.  
An increased susceptibility to HZ infections in patients having  developed auto-antibodies against IFNγ4 
or having receiv ed ustekinumab ( a mAb which decreases IFNγ production by [CONTACT_184041] p40 subunit 
of IL-12) has been described in the literature5.  
In conclusion, the infusion of NI-0501 was well tolerated and the effects observed during the 8 week 
monitoring after drug in f
usion did not reveal any serious or unexpected off-target safety or 
immunogenicity concerns.  
A study is presently ongoing to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NI-0501 treatment in patients with 
primary HLH (protocol NI -
0501-04). The protocol allows for inclusion of patients either treatment-naïve 
(first line patients) or reactivating after initial response to conventional therapy or not achieving a 
satisfactory response or showing intolerance to conventional therapy  (second line patients) . Based on  
preliminary efficacy and safety evidence, and on the positi ve benefit/risk profile observed so far, the 
study, which originated as Phase 2 trial, has been recently  amend ed to continu e as Phase 2/3 study with 
the inclusion of the same study population (i.e., first and second line pHLH patients ). Thirty -one patients  
have been enrolled  as of September  15th 2016, of whom [ADDRESS_1067869] received a median of 7 weeks of thera py (range 4  days-31 weeks; continuation of NI -
0501 treatment beyond 8 weeks can occur under the long -term follow- up protocol NI -0501 -05). Infusions 
have been well tolerated with no premedication needed,  and no safety concerns  after NI -[ADDRESS_1067870] emerged to date. Based on data gathered so far, NI -0501 treatment has shown the 
potential to improv e relevant clinical and laboratory features of HLH such as fever, splenomegaly, 
cytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and also CNS signs and symptoms. Early tapering of 
glucocorticoids has been possible in the majority of patients.  
1.2 HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS (HLH) 
HLH is a rare, serious an d 
life threatening disease of pathologic immune activation, characterized by 
[CONTACT_777562] (fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, coagulopathy), 
leading to the development of abnormal immune-mediated pathologies which, through tissue damage, ultimately may cause multi-organ failure and death
6. 
HLH comprises primary (genetic/familial) HLH and secondary HLH. 
Page 95 of 150
Study NI- 0501- 06 NI-0501 in MAS/sHLH in sJIA patients Page 19 of 73 
Protocol NI-0501- 06                           Version 1.0 US – October 19, 2017 CONFIDENTIAL Primary HLH is a heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder, mostly seen in infancy and early 
childhood with an estimated prevalence in Europe of 1/50,[ADDRESS_1067871] of NK- cells and/or 
cytotoxic ly m
phocytes required to eliminate activated macrophages, encoding proteins for perforin 
synthesis, cytolytic granule maturation, granule exocytosis and release9. In addition, some 
immunodeficiency syndromes, e.g. Griscelli syndrome type 2 (GS-2) and Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), present frequently with HLH
10. 
Secondary forms of HLH can occur during the course of an infection, an autoimmune/rheumatic disease or in association to a mali g 
nancy. Secondary forms present with the same signs and symptoms of primary 
HLH and can be equally severe.  
The presence of signs and symptoms of HLH in patients suffering from a rheumatic disease, such as 
systemic Juvenile Idiopathic A r
thritis (sJIA) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), is often referred 
to by [CONTACT_184045] (MAS), as more specifically described in the 
following section.   
In the present protocol, any reference made to MAS should be intended as referring to the secondary 
form of HLH occurring in pati en
ts with sJIA. 
1.2.1 Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)  
MAS is a severe, potentia l
ly life-threatening complication of rheumatic diseases which is caused by 
[CONTACT_777563] T lymphocytes and macrophages. The uncontrolled expansion of 
these immune cells results in a marked hypercytokinemia and a hyperinflammatory state associated with fever, cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly, liver dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities and hyperferritinemia, and may progress to multiple organ failure and death
11. 
Because of its strong clinical and pathological similarity to HLH, MAS is classified among the secondary 
or acquired forms of HLH .
 In fact, it has been recently demonstrated that the majority of patients with 
MAS have impaired NK and perforin functional tests and that a significant number of MAS patients 
show polymorphisms or heterozygous mutations in PRF1 and UNC13D12. 
MAS occurs most frequently in patients with sJIA and, less often with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but is also described, t 
hough more rarely, in patients with vasculitis, particularly with Kawasaki 
disease. Approximately 7–17% of patients with sJIA develop overt MAS13,14, some evidence suggests 
that subclinical MAS may be seen in as many as one third of patients with active systemic disease15. 
Because MAS is potentially fatal, a timely diagnosis and immediate therapeutic intervention are essential for appropriate management  
of the disease. The reported mortality rates in MAS reach 20 -30%, and it 
remains the major source of mortality in pediatric rheumatology16. 
Different sets of criteria have been proposed for the diagnosis of MAS in patients with sJIA. The HLH-2004 diagnostic guidelines
17, primarily developed for primary (genetic) forms of HLH, have sometimes 
been recommended. However, they present   several limitations when applied to patients with sJIA. For example, criteria such as cytopenias and hypofibrinogenemia below the thresholds required by [CONTACT_333435]-
[ADDRESS_1067872] increased white blood 
cell and platelet counts as well as elevated serum levels of fibrinogen as a part of the sJIA inf lammatory 
response
11. As for primary HLH, hemophagocytosis may not be present in a significant proportion of 
patients with MAS at presentation18. Moreover, hemophagocytosis, NK cell activity and sCD25 are not 
routinely assessed in the context of MAS.

Protocol NI-0501- 06                           Version 1.0 US – October 19, 2017 CONFIDENTIAL An alternative approach has been proposed based on the application of preliminary diagnostic guidelines 
(PDG) for MAS complicating sJIA, which were created through the analysis of a cohort of patients with MAS compared with a group of patients with a flare of sJIA
19.  
The HLH-2004 diagnostic guidelines and the preliminary diagnostic guidelines for sJIA-associated MAS were compared for their capa c 
ity to discriminate sJIA/MAS from sJIA (in the absence of MAS) and 
systemic infection in a large patient population20. Although with some limitations due to its retrospective 
nature, this study suggested that the preliminary MAS diagnostic guidelines may achieve a satisfactory balance between sensitivity and specificity, as well as concordance with the diagnosis made by [CONTACT_777564]/MAS from sJIA, while their specificity in 
discriminating vs. systemic infections was < 30%. Moreover, it has been reported that the proportion of patients fulfilling each single criterion of the PDG is highly variable, and some clinical features (e.g. CNS 
dysfunction and hemorrhages) may manifest at a late stage of MAS, rendering their sensitivity low in 
incipi[INVESTIGATOR_777457]
21. The sensitivity of the adapted HLH-2004 set of 4 of 5 criteria was poor (35%), mainly 
explained by [CONTACT_777565]. 
Very recently, an EULAR/ACR-approved set of classification criteria sets have been proposed through a 
multistep process combini ng
 expert consensus and retrospective analysis of patient data22. These 
classification criteria did not unequivocally prove to be useful for diagnosis in clinical practice (about 
30% of patients diagnosed by [CONTACT_777566]), and showed 
important limitations to identify patients who develop ed MAS while receiving IL-[ADDRESS_1067873]-line treatment for MAS. In patients failing to respond to 
glucocorticoids, Cyclosporine A (CsA) 
has been proposed as additional treatment25.  
Being part of the HLH- [ADDRESS_1067874] been a few reports of sJIA patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_777497]
26–29, as well as of patients who do not respond to these treatments, indicating that inhibition of 
IL-1, IL-6R or TNFα does not provide full protection against MAS development nor an efficacious 
treatment of the full blown syndrome. 
A large retrospective, multicenter survey has investigated the clinical, laboratory, and histopathological 
characteristics as well as
 curren t practice treatment and outcome of MAS in a total of 362 patients18.  
In approximately half of the patients, MAS occurred in the context of active sJIA in the absence of a 
specific trigger, wit h 
a median time interval between the onset of sJIA and MAS of approximately 4 
months. However, in about 25% of patients MAS occurred at sJIA onset with the diagnosis of MAS and 
sJIA being done simultaneously. In about one third of the patients, an infectious trigger was identified, 
most commonly EBV. Nearly all patients were given glucocorticoids, given the well-established role of 
this treatment approach in MAS and HLH . Cyclosporine was the other most commonly prescribed drug

etoposide were given to 36%, 15% and 12% of the patients, respectively.  
The identification of effective therapeutic regimens for MAS represents an area of unmet high medical 
need. More than 50% of patient s w
ith sJIA and MAS do not respond to systemic glucocorticoids alone, or 
may require prolonged treatment at high doses with associated significant morbidity. When patients fail 
to respond to glucocorticoids, no good evidence-based data is available on the effectiveness and safety of additional treatments such as CsA or etoposide. The course of MAS may become rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777460] a fatal outcome, with about one third of the patients requiring ICU admission. Furthermore, n o 
clinical and/or laboratory features have thus far been identified to be predictive of poor response to the current standard of care, hence leaving the treating physicians with scarce possibility to identify those patients who would rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777461].

ined immune cell activation and an associated cytokine storm of 
proinflammatory cytokines  
with overproduction of IFNγ, TNFα, IL-1 and IL-66,30–32. During the last 
years, evidence has been accumulating in support of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_184002]γ in the development of both HLH
33–35 and MAS36,37. 
For primary HLH, perforin knock-out mice are considered a relevant model as these mice, once infected with LCMV, develop all t h 
e diagnostic and many of the clinical and laboratory characteristic features of 
the human disease. The HLH-like disease that they develop is dependent on CD8+ T cells and IFN γ 
produced in response to antigen stimulation33. It was demonstrated that when the high circulating levels 
of IFNγ are neutralized with the administration of an anti-IFNγ antibody, not only are the clinical and 
laboratory abnormalities reverted, but also survival rate is dramatically improved. On the contrary, the ablation of many other cytokines had no impact on survival
33,34. Further strengthening the importance of 
IFNγ in HLH are the high concentrations of circulating IFNγ levels found in these patients6,32.  In a series 
of 71 patients monitored from HLH diagnosis to treatment and follow-up, IFNγ levels were above the upper limit of normal (17.3 pg/mL) in all patients, and in particular 53.5% had levels above 1000 pg/mL. It was also reported that IFNγ levels rise early and quickly, and can fall from > 5000 pg/mL to normal in [ADDRESS_1067876] been investigated in the context of the NI-0501 development 
program to elucidate the poten t
ial pathogenetic role of IFNγ: 
- In a murine model that mimics an infection-driven HLH, repeated administrations of CpG via 
activation of
 TLR9 triggered a hypercytokinemia that led to clinical (e.g. body weight loss, 
splenomegaly) and laboratory (e.g. cytopenia, hyperferritinemia)  features of HLH37. When IFNγ 
was neutralized by [CONTACT_777519]-IFNγ antibody, clinical and laboratory features 
of the disease were reverted. The neutralization of IFNγ was shown to be complete also in relevant target tissues, such as the liver and the spleen. Interestingly, the administration of the anti-IFNγ antibody unveiled an amount of IFNγ 500- to 2,000-fold higher than that measured in 
blood, likely to better reflect the IFNγ production in tissues. The two IFNγ-inducible chemokines 
(CXCL9 and CXCL10) we re upregulated after TLR9 stimulation both in blood and in liver, and a 
significantly correlation was observed between serum levels of IFNγ with CXCL9 and CXCL10 
serum concentrations. The neutralization of IFNγ induced a significant decrease of serum 
CXCL9 and CXCL10, and of their mRNA levels in the liver

secondary forms of HLH. When triggered with Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) ligands, increased 
lethality, increased inflammatory cytokine production and hyperactivation of inflammatory 
signaling pathways was observed. Moreover, these mice showed a drop in platelet and neutrophil counts, increased sCD25, ferritin and LDH levels, resembling many of the features typi[INVESTIGATOR_777463]
39. In these mice, when IFNγ is neutralized with the administration 
of an anti-IFNγ antibody, survival is markedly improved and laboratory parameters reverted40.  
1.3.2 Rationale for conducting a Clinical Study in M AS/sJIA patients receiving N I -0501 
treatment 
Evidence has been recently gathered in an observational study conducted in patients with secondary forms of HLH, either conseque n 
t to infections, or of unknown origin (pHLH having been excluded by 
[CONTACT_777520], absence of mutation in known genes causing pHLH and absence of family history) or with MAS occurring in the context of sJIA.  
In 14 patients with secondary HLH (in 7 of whom an underlying infection was identifiable), serum 
samples were analyzed during  
active full blown disease and during disease remission. Levels of IFNγ, 
CXCL9 and CXCL10 were markedly higher in the active phase compared to disease remission (IFNγ : 
34.7 vs. <3.5 pg/ml; CXCL9: [ZIP_CODE] vs. 745 pg/ml; CXCL10: 4420 vs. 132 pg/ml; median values). IFNγ 
levels significantly correlated with the levels of CXCL9 (p=0.0018) and, to a lesser extent, of CXCL10 (p=0.014). The levels of IFNγ and chemokines (in particular CXCL9) correlated significantly with parameters of disease severity, such as neutrophil and platelet counts, ferritin and ALT, further 
supporting the pathogenic role of IFNγ in secondary HLH and the potential use of chemokines as relevant 
biomarkers of the disease
38. 
Similar findings have been shown in patients with MAS occurring in patients with sJIA. Serum concentrations of IFNγ, IFN γ 
-inducible chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11) and IL-6 were 
measured in 54 patients with sJIA, of whom 20 had MAS. The levels of IL-6 were comparable in patients 
with full-blown MAS and those with active sJIA but without MAS at the time of sampling. On the 
contrary, circulating IFNγ and chemokine levels were significantly higher in MAS, particularly for CXCL9, whose median levels were approximately 15-fold higher compared to patients with active sJIA without MAS ([ZIP_CODE] vs. 837 pg/mL; p=0.005). Noteworthy, a significant correlation was demonstrated 
only in patients with MAS between CXCL9 levels and parameters typi[INVESTIGATOR_777464] 
(p=0.041), neutrophil (p=0.010) and platelet (p=0.022) counts, ALT (p=0.044) and LDH (p=0.013). 
Levels of IFNγ also correlated with laboratory parameters of disease severity, with the exception of LDH 
for which statistical significance was not achieved
41. 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] 2 study, as well as the twin study in Europe, is intended to assess the 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynami cs
 profile, the safety and tolerability, and the preliminary efficacy of 
NI-0501 as treatment of MAS in sJIA patients.  
Based on the evidence above described, there is a solid rationale for the neutralization of IFNγ as targeted 
therapy for MAS

In conclusion, there is a strong rationale for neutralizing IFNγ in MAS secondary to rh eum atic diseases 
based on pre-clinical and clinical evidence, and the preliminary data in pHLH patients indicates a 
favorable benefit/risk profile of NI-[ADDRESS_1067882] 6 weeks. While they appear to be used to classify patients, they cannot be used at disease presentation. In order to allow inclusion of 
patients presenting with MAS as a feature of onset of sJIA a, the operational criteria  designed 
by [CONTACT_777523] (childhood arthritis and rheumatology research alliance) to identify patients with 
sJIA early in their disease course 
(DeWitt EM et al. Arthritis Care Res 2012  , Appendix A)  have been 
also considered to assess patient eligibility.  
The number of patients meeting the ILAR classification criteria will be in any case included in 
the description of the NI-0501-06 study results. 
Patients enrolled under these twin protocols (for a total of 10 patients, 5 in Europe and 5 in North 
America) will be analyzed jointly and data reported in a single CSR.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
This is an open-label, single arm, international, multicenter pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] 2.  
After signature [CONTACT_43998], patients will be screened and assessed for eligibility ( Section 3.2 ). 
The study will be conducted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_777467], at minimum, the day before the first 
administration of the study dr ug
 (study day minus one, SD-1) until SD15 at the earliest.   
Discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_777468]15 onwards , at the Investigator ’ s discretion if the patient ’s 
condition allows, provided that no active infections requiring i.v. antimicrobial therapy are present.  
For a detailed description of the study procedures, see Section 8 . 
The study flow-chart is summarized in Figure 1 .

confirmation of patient elig
ibility and following the signature [CONTACT_42956]. 
In the event that a patient’s medical condition warrants rapid treatment initiation, and to avoid unnecessary repetition of r 
ecent interventions, results of tests which have been performed as part of the 
normal patient’s care at the site (or at the referring hosp ital) not more than [ADDRESS_1067885] NI-0501 
infusion, can be considered for screening purposes (inclusion/exclusion criteria checks), with the agreement of both the Sponsor and the Investigator. 
Information regarding the inadequate response to high dose i.v. glucocorticoids ( as required for patient 
eligibility ), will be collected and recorded  in the CRF . 
Samples for infection screening need to be collected for analysis according to the protocol requirements; 
however availability of th
e results is not required prior to NI-0501 initiation if the patient’s medical 
condition warrants rapid treatment, provided that there are no clinical findings suggestive for the presence of any of the infections which represent exclusion criteria. 
In the case of a patient having received BCG vaccination, a [COMPANY_003] test must be performed and combined with an IFNγ-release assay.  
A 
negative serum pregnancy test has to be documented in female patients who  are post -pubescent.  
For a detailed description of the study procedures during the screening period see Section 8 .  
3.3 TREATMENT PERIOD 
NI-0501 will be administered i.v. at the initial dose of 6 mg/kg, and continued at the dose of 3 mg/kg, 
every 3 days until SD15, and then tw i
ce-a-week for additional 2 weeks, i.e. until SD28.  
Treatment may be shortened upon achievement of complete clinical response (i.e. MAS remission), however at least two infusions of  N 
I-0501 at the dose of 3 mg/kg have to be administered (i.e. after SD6). 
In such circumstances, efficacy/safety visits have to be in any case performed every 3 days until SD15 
and then twice-a-week until SD28.  
In the event that the PK profile of NI-0501 in a given patient indicates a Target Mediated Drug 
Disposition (TMDD) suggest i
ve for very high IFN  production, the planned NI-0501 regimen may be 
adapted (e.g. the dose of NI-0501 may be increased or the NI-0501 treatment may be prolonged beyond 4 
weeks) guided by [CONTACT_777567], upon confirmation of a favorable benefit/risk profile in that 
individual patient.  
3.[ADDRESS_1067886] visit for a given patient under the NI-0501-06 study will normally be on SD56 (except in case of  
pr
olongation of NI-0501 treatment beyond 4 weeks, as above described). 
Afterwards all patients will be asked to enter a long-term follow-up study, NI0501-05, to allow long-term 
outcome and safety surveillance, and 
to monitor NI -0501 elimination profile.  
In the event that additional monitoring of NI-0501 concentrations is requ i red (e.g., NI-0501 serum levels 
still measurable at EoS) and cannot be performed in the context of the long-term follow-up study ,

In case of an ongoing serious adverse event (SAE), the patient will continue to be monitored until 
resolution or until t he 
outcome of the event is known and stable, beyond the defined study end, as 
necessary.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1067888] one dose of NI-0501 in the study will be asked to participate in a 
long-term follow-up study,  
to monitor long-term outcome and safety after NI-0501 treatment, and, when 
relevant, to complete the assessment of the NI-0501 elimination profile.

5.2 DOSING REGIMEN 
NI-0501 will be administered at the initial dose of 6 mg/kg by [CONTACT_67489] a period of one to two hour s 
depending on the volume to i
nfuse. Treatment will be continued at the dose of 3 mg/kg every 3 days until 
SD15, and twice-a-week thereafter for a total of 4 weeks (i.e. up to SD28).  
Treatment may be shortened upon achievement of complete clinical response (i.e. MAS remission), 
however at least two infu si
ons of NI-0501 at the dose of 3 mg/kg have to be administered (i.e. after SD6). 
In the event that the PK profile of NI-0501 in a given patient indicates a Target Mediated Drug 
Disposition (TMDD) suggest i
ve for very high IFN  production, the planned NI-0501 regimen may be 
adapted by [CONTACT_777569]-0501 upon assessment of a favorable benefit/risk profile in that 
individual patient. NI-0501 treatment may be prolonged beyond 4 weeks guided by [CONTACT_777560]/PD 
evidence, upon confirmation of a favorable benefit/risk profile in that individual patient. 
5.3 RATIONALE FOR DOSE SELECTION  
 The rationale for the dosi n
g strategy foreseen for this study is based on: 
‐ Data from in vitro  experiments investi g ating the binding kinetics of NI-0501 to human IFNγ and the 
functional inhibition of human IFNγ by [CONTACT_183957]-0501; 
‐ PK information from recombinant IFNγ in human; 
‐ Data from the Phase 1 NI-0501 -
03 study in which NI-0501 was administered to healthy volunteers; 
‐ Data gathered so far from the ongoing NI-0501-[ADDRESS_1067896] or second line;  
‐ D
ata from an observational study in patients with MAS developi[INVESTIGATOR_54139] a background of sJIA41; 
‐ Data from an observational study in pediatric patients with secondary HLH (having excluded a 
rheumatic or neoplastic orig i
n)38.  
The analysis of data generated from the ongoing study in which primary HLH patients have been treated 
with NI-0501 has allowed to es
timate the production rate of IFNγ through the assessment of the “total 
IFNγ” (i.e. IFNγ bound to NI-0501 and free IFNγ), and consequently the concentration of NI-0501 
required to neutralize the variably high IFNγ concentrations. It has also been possible to determine that 
when there is a high production of IFNγ, target mediated drug disposition occurs. Importantly, the relationship between IFNγ and the IFNγ-inducible chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 has been 
investigated establishing the tight correlation between those chemokines measured prior to the 
Page 105 of 150
Study NI- 0501- 06 NI-0501 in MAS/sHLH in sJIA patients Page 29 of 73 
Protocol NI-0501- 06                           Version 1.0 US – October 19, 2017 CONFIDENTIAL administration of NI-0501 and “Total IFNγ” at [ADDRESS_1067897] constituted the foundation of the dosing rationale for this protocol and led 
to the selection of the N I
-0501 doses to be administered to patients with MAS not responding to high 
dose glucocorticoid therapy are the followings:    
‐ there is a tight correlation between IFNγ and the IFNγ-related chemok i nes CXCL9 and CXCL10, as 
well as between disease parameters and levels of IFNγ and IFNγ-related chemokines in patients 
suffering from HLH38,41; 
‐ the higher the circulating levels of the IFN -related chemokines, the hi gher is the concentration of 
NI-0501 (and therefore the dose of NI-0501) required to neutralize the corresponding levels of IFNγ 
(data from the NI-0501-04 study on file at Novimmune); 
‐ the neutralization of IFNγ has been shown to have a therapeu t ic role in primary HLH patients42; 
‐ a trend towards higher levels of circulating IFNγ-related chemokines has b ee n observed in patients 
with secondary forms of HLH compared to primary HLH patients38,41 during or soon after HLH 
conventional therapy ( see Figure 2; data from the NI-0501-04 study on file at Novimmune); 
‐ the onset of MAS is usually acute and the disease worsens rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777500] I FN f
rom the very beginning of treatment; 
‐ in MAS patients, differently from patients with primary HLH, the risk of reactivation is extremely 
low once HLH remission i s 
achieved, and HSCT is not required. Therefore in patients with MAS, 
shorter treatment duration is anticipated compared to primary HLH patients, not requiring a maintenance phase while awaiting for HSCT.

Simulations performed considering different IFN production rates that are anticipated to potentially 
occur in MAS patients are presented in Figure 3. The simulations clearly show that the risk of NI-[ADDRESS_1067898] peak and trough concentrations will remain 
within the ones already achieved in primary HLH patients treated in the ongoing study. 
The PK model used to produce these simulations is a two compartment model with linear elimination 
assuming allometric scalin g
 based on body weight (BW) to which an additional non-linear (TMDD) 
elimination pathway characterized by a VMAX and a KM has been added. Parameters used in the 
simulations are from a population pharmacokinetic analysis of study NI-0501-03 and assuming allometric scaling. VMAX is the IFNγ concentration (0.1 nM) multiplied by [CONTACT_777524]γ clearance 
(1.2 L/h/kg) divided by [CONTACT_777525]. KM is assumed to be equal to KD.

of 6 mg/kg followed by 9 doses of 3 mg/kg every 3 days  
 
Note :  
Simulations are shown for sJIA MAS patients of an approximate body weight of [ADDRESS_1067899] peak and trough concentrations observed in HLH patients from study NI- 0501 -04/05 (data cut-off date of June 24, 2016). 
The proposed dosing strategy is further supported by [CONTACT_616423]: 
‐ primary HLH patients treated with NI-0501 in the context of the ongoing study who were 
characterized by [CONTACT_777570] C
XCL9 comparable to the ones expected in MAS all required a rapid and 
significant NI-0501 dose increase;  
‐ primary  HLH patients having a high production of IFNγ, required a high  dose of NI -0501, 
demonstrating the presence of target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) , i.e. a pronounced increased 
clearance of NI -[ADDRESS_1067900] er NI-0501 at high doses and sometimes more frequently, prevent s NI-0501 accumulation to 
occur ; 
‐ to date NI-0501 has shown a good safety profile when administered to primary HLH patients up to 
the dose of 10 mg/kg, achi ev
ing similar or even higher NI-[ADDRESS_1067901] been performed in all patients 
treated (including CU) and around 20% have been performed at a dose of  6mg/kg. 
In conclusion, based on a production rate of IFNγ expected to be high in sJI A  patients with overt MAS41, 
an initial dose of 6 mg/kg followed by [CONTACT_777527] 3 mg/kg is deemed appropriate to 
achieve rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777501]-[ADDRESS_1067902] neutralization of IFNγ activity.

3 days from  starting high dose i.v. glucocorticoids , in case the patient’s condition and/or lab parameters  
are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777473] . 
High dose i.v. glucocorticoids should not be lower than 2 mg/kg/day of mPDN equivalent in 2 divided 
doses (to a maximum of 60 mg/day in pat i
ents of 30 kg or more).

Protocol NI-0501- 06                           Version 1.0 US – October 19, [ADDRESS_1067908] 2 mg/kg/day of 
mPDN equivalent (to a maximum of 60 mg/day in patients of 30 kg or more ). 
Glucocorticoid tapering may be initiated as soon as the patient ’s conditions allow, accordi ng  to the 
Investigator’s assessment. The tapering scheme can be selected by [CONTACT_737], with the objective of 
reaching the same (or lower) dose being administered before the occurrence of MAS (in patients already on treatment for sJIA) or decreasing by 50% (or more) the glucocorticoid dose administered at initiation of NI-0501 treatment (in patients presenting with MAS as first manifestation of sJIA).   
In the event of disease worsening after glucocorticoid tapering, a higher dose can be re-introduced and 
maintained until a satis f
actory response is achieved according to the Investigator.  
6.2 PROPHYLACTIC TREATME NT  
Prophylaxis for Herpes Zo
ster (HZ) virus i nf ection will be administered to mitigate the potential risk 
associated to NI-0501 administration (see Benefit/Risk Management, Section 10.5 ). 
Patients will therefore receive the prophylactic treatment starting preferably the day before (i.e. SD-1), 
and in any case prior to, init
iation of NI-0501 treatment on SD0, and continued until serum NI-0501 
levels are no longer detectable, as follows: 
 For HZ virus prevention, according t o I nstitution/Country Guidelines/Recommendations (e.g. 
Acyclovir 200 mg four times daily for children over two years, for children under two years 
100 mg four times daily). 
In the unlikely event that a patient, previously vaccinated for TB, shows  a Purified Protein Derivative  
([COMPANY_003])  test result ≥ 5mm and a negative IFNγ -release assay , the patients  will rec eive TB prophylaxis  
according to Institution /Country  Guidelines/Recommendations (e.g. Isoniazid).   
In case NI-[ADDRESS_1067909] 3 days prior to initiation of NI-0501 treatment. CsA 
dose adjustments will be perf
ormed if required based on results of therapeutic drug monitoring, in order 
to maintain therapeutic levels. CsA can be withdrawn at any time during the study, upon judgment of the 
Investigator. CsA cannot be introduced once NI-0501 administration has started. 
6.3.2  Intrathecal Therapy 
For patients receiving i nt
rathecal therapy (e.g. methotrexate and glucocorticoids) at the time of NI-0501 
treatment initiation, this t r
eatment will be continued until clinically indicated.  
6.3.3  Other possible concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_777475], t r
ansfusion of blood products, electrolyte and glucose infusions , i.v. parenteral 
nutriti on, 
inotropic support, antibiotics, anti-fungal and anti-viral treatment, ultrafiltration or 
hemodialysis, as well as general supportive care (e.g. gastro-protective agents, anti-hypertensive et c.) are 
permitted during the study.  
The use of any prescription or over-the-counter medication, including herbal and homeopathic 
preparations with the exception 
of multi-vitamins, needs to be notified to the Investigator.

Protocol NI-0501- 06                           Version 1.0 US – October 19, 2017 CONFIDENTIAL 6.3.4 Not allowed concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_777502]-0501 treatment as 
follows: 
- Anakinra must be discont
inued at latest before the first NI-0501 infusion; however no wash-out period 
is required due to the short hal
f-life of the drug. 
- A wash-out period of [ADDRESS_1067910] been treated 
with Tocilizumab, Canakinumab or  T
NF inhibitors. 
It is recommended background treatment of sJIA not to be re-introduced during the 8 weeks of the study, 
unless the patient’s clinical condi
tions require it . 
As long as NI-0501 is being administered, no concomitant use of etoposide, T-cell depleting agents, or 
any other biologic drug is all ow
ed, with the exception of: 
 G-CSF, in case of prolonged neutropeni a  
 Rituximab, in case of documented EBV infection. 
Vaccination with a liv e 
or attenuated-live (including BCG) vaccine must be avoided during the whole 
study. In the event that NI- 0501 
concentrations are still measurable after the end of the study, the period 
with no vaccinations should be extended until serum NI -0501 levels are no longer detectable.  
 
6.4 EMERGENCY TREATMENT 
As none of the NI-0501 inf u
sions administered to healthy volunteers or patients has triggered any 
medically significant r ea
ction, this is considered an unlikely event during the study. However, should 
severe allergic reactions (such as anaphylactic shock) occur, they would require prompt i.v. treatment 
with adrenaline and antihistamines. Oxygen shall be supplied through a face mask. Patients must have an appropriately sized i.v. line that allows rapid infusion of colloid volume substitution. Transfer to the intensive care unit of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_777477].  
Following the first administration of NI-0501 and before leaving the study site, each patient (and/or 
patient’s legal representat i
ve) will be given a card to carry at all times in case of any emergency. The card 
gives details of the name [CONTACT_18467], name [CONTACT_184100], and the address and telephone number of the study site. 
 
6.5 RESCUE THERAPY 
Patients who are withdraw n 
from the study due to a safety issue or for lack of efficacy (i.e. worsening of 
MAS/no response to NI-0501) will  
be treated according to the standard of care at the site.  
7 ENDPOINTS 
The main objective of the study is to confirm that the proposed dosing regimen is adequate in relation to 
the IFNγ production in patients with MAS secondary to sJIA.  
For this purpose, a PK-PD analysis will be perf o rmed based on:  
 levels of circulating NI-0501 
 levels of total IFNγ 
 levels of main IFNγ –i
nduced chemokines (namel y  CXCL9 and CXCL10).

Free NI-0501 concentrations will be measured in serum to determine the PK profile of NI-0501 in this 
patient population
, and to confirm the adequacy of the proposed dosing regimen. 
All PK data will be summarised  using appropriate graphical and ta bular presentations. Descriptive non -
compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis (NCA) will be applied: C max (concentration corresponding to 
Tmax), T max (time of maximum observed concentration), C EOI (concentration at the end of infusion), C trough 
(concentratio n just before administration), AUC  (area under curve of a dosing interval), AUC last (area 
under curve from the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration), λz (first order rate constant 
associated with the terminal (log -linear) portion of the cur ve, estimated via linear regression of time 
versus log concentration), t ½ (plasma half -life), CL (systemic drug clearance), Vss (volume of distribution 
at steady state). Individual and mean PK parameters will be tabulated. Exploratory compartmental PK 
analysis and population PK analysis will be undertaken to investigate linear and non -linear (TMDD) 
kinetics.  
In addition, PK analysis will be done when a total of [ADDRESS_1067911] been recruited in Europe and North 
America inclusive, to asses s t
he appropriateness of the dose selection. 
 
7.2 PHAR MACODYNAMICS ENDPOINT S  
Assessment of PD parameters will include, but will not be limited to, the followings: 
 Levels of circulating free IFN  at pre-dose, and of total  IFNγ (free IFNγ+bound to NI-0501) after 
initiation of NI-0501 treatment.  
 Levels of the main IFNγ-induced chemokines (C X CL9, CXCL10). 
 Correlation between chemokine levels (CXCL9, CXCL10) and levels of free NI-0501, free IFNγ 
(pre-dose) and total IFN
γ (exploratory analysis ). 
 Correlation between chemokine and total IFNγ levels, and laboratory  parameters of MAS 
severity, e.g. ferritin, platelet counts, LFTs ( exploratory analysis ). 
 Levels of other potential disease biomarkers (e.g. sCD25, sCD163, IL-18, IL-10, IL-6, TNF, 
CXCL11 ). 
 Levels (if a
ny) of circulating antibodies against NI-0501 to determine immunogenicity, i.e. the 
development of anti-drug antibodi es
 (ADAs). 
 
7.3 SAFETY ENDPOINTS 
The tolerability and saf et
y of NI-0501 treatment will be assess ed a s follows:  
 Incidence, severity, causality and outcomes of AEs (serious and non-serious), with particular attention being paid to in f 
ections. 
 Evolution of laboratory parameters, in particular CBC,  LFTs, inflammatory m arkers (ferritin and 
CRP) and coagulation parameters. 
 Number of patients withdrawn due to safety reasons. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_1067912] features of cy t
openias, liver function and coagulopathy. 
In particular the following variables will be preliminarily assessed:

Protocol NI-0501- 06                           Version 1.0 US – October 19, 2017 CONFIDENTIAL  Number of patients achieving MAS remission by [CONTACT_10585] 8 after initiation of NI-0501 treatment.  
 Time to MAS remission. 
 Number of patients for whom at any time during the study glucocorticoids can be tapered i) to the 
same (or lower) dose be i
ng administered before the occurrence of MAS (in those patients who are 
already treated for sJIA) or ii) by 50% (or less) of the dose administered at NI-0501 treatment 
start (in those patients who present with MAS at sJIA onset).  
 Time to achievement of glucocorticoids tapering (as defined above). 
 Survi v
al time. 
 Number of patients withdrawn from the study due to lack of efficacy. 
 
MAS remission is defined as 
 Resol u
tion of clinical signs and symptoms according to the Investigator  
and 
 Normalization of labora
tory parameters relevant to MAS, as follows:  
- WBC and platelet count above LLN  
- LDH bel ow
 1.[ADDRESS_1067913] 
- ALT/AST below 1.[ADDRESS_1067914] 
- fibrinogen higher than 100 mg/dL 
- ferritin levels decreased by [CONTACT_2669] 80% from values at screening or baseline (whichever is 
higher) or below 2000 ng/ml, w hi
chever is lower.  
8 OUTLINE OF STUDY PROCEDURES 
8.1 STUDY VISITS 
For a detailed description of the visit schedule and assessments, please refer to Table 1  (Schedule of 
Assessment – Screening and NI-0501 T r
eatment Period ) and Table 2  (Schedule of Assessment –
Evaluation Period). 
Patients wi l
l be recruited from specialized study centers in North America, in which an intensive care unit 
is available. If not already  h
ospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], the patient will enter the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_777478]-1. 
During the NI-0501 Treatment Period, Infusion Visits will occur every 3 days until SD15, and twice-a-
week thereafter until SD
28, and will also serve as Efficacy/Safety visits. In case NI-0501 treatment is 
shortened after SD6, Efficacy/Safety visits have to be in any case performed with the same schedule until SD28, in order to assess the evolution of MAS clinical and laboratory features, and to closely monitor 
safety.     
From SD28 and during the Evaluation Period, visits will occur on a weekly schedule (a  2-day window 
is allowed) for  
efficacy and safety evaluation, and follow-up after NI-[ADDRESS_1067915] infusion. 
Discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_184005]15. After SD15, in case the patient condition allows, 
the patient can be discharg ed, 
at the Investigator’s discretion, provided that no active infections requiring 
i.v. antimicrobial therapy are present.  
Some procedures are not mandatory or do not need to be done systematically but only when applicable 
according to the following spe
cifications:  
 ECG is mandatory at screening, after first infusion, and at the end of the study, however it should 
also be performed whenever req ui
red based on clinical judgment.

Protocol NI-0501- 06                           Version 1.0 US – October 19, 2017 CONFIDENTIAL  Broad search for pathogens during the study (beside the ones required per protocol) should be 
done if there is any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_184010].  
 Chest X-ray during the study (beside the ones required per protocol) should be done more frequently in case of cli ni 
cal suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a pulmonary infection. 
 Functional tests relevant to HLH diagnosis should be performed whenever possible; however 
availability of result s 
is not required for patient inclusion in the study. 
The following situations will not be considered as protocol deviations: 
 Missing data if not occurring at 2 consecutive time-points.  
 A  5-min difference in the timing of vital sign measurements during NI-0501 infusion. 
 A  10-min difference in the timing of vital sign measurements after NI-[ADDRESS_1067916] be signed by [CONTACT_102] ( as required by [CONTACT_1769]) or  by [CONTACT_102]’s 
legally authorized representative prior to any study-related procedures, with the assent of patients who are deemed suitable to provide it, as applicable.  
Patients will be screened for eligibility prior to enrolment into the study. The Investigator must keep a log 
of the patients screened for the s
tudy and reasons for non-eligibility, if applicable. 
Screening evaluations should be completed within up to [ADDRESS_1067917] administration of the study drug (SD0). Clinica l 
 and laboratory assessments should be performed as close as possible to 
initiation of NI -0501 treatment, preferably on SD -1, as described in Table 1 .  
In the event that a patient’s medical condition warrants rapid t reatment initiation, and to avoid 
unnecessary repetition of recent interventions, results of tests which have been performed as part of the normal patient’s care at the site (or at the referring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) not more than [ADDRESS_1067918] NI-0501 infusion, may be considered for screening purposes (inclusion/exclusion criteria checks) with the 
agreement of both the Sponsor and Investigator. 
The following patient information must be collected: 
 Demographic and medical history 
 Detailed information on inadequate response to high dose i.v. glucocorticoids. 
 Concomitant medication at screening.  
 Date of sJIA diagnosis. 
 sJIA treatment previously received and ongoing at the time of screening. 
 Date and criteria of eligibility.  
 Relev ant
 clinical and laboratory  data in order to characterize a posteriori  the study population 
according to HLH-[ADDRESS_1067919] to be 
collected and send to a centralized la bor
atory only if the patient has given consent for genetic testing. 
A panel of genes already known to be involved in primary HLH (PRF1, UNC13D, STX11, STXBP2, 
LYST, RAB27A, SH2D1A, XIAP) will be t es
ted.  
Given the evolving knowledge and new findings within the scientific community with regard to potential 
modifying genes for HLH e.g. 
AP3B1, HPS1, IRF5, ITK, KIR2DL1, MyD88, SLC7A7, TNFRSF7/

8.3.1 Vital signs   
Vital signs include measurement of body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation . 
Body temperature will be recorded in the morning of visit days as indicated in the SoA. 
On the day of NI-0501 infusion, heart rate and oxygen saturation will be recorded before and 
continuously monitored after  
the infusion (for 24 hours if the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], and for 4 hours if 
patient is an outpatient).  
Body temperature and blood pressure will be recorded before and at regular intervals after NI-0501 
infusion as follows:  
- at 
the first infusion, every hour during the first [ADDRESS_1067928]-dose (if no safety concerns have 
emerged after the first i
nfusion).  
Blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation will be measured every 15 minutes during NI-0501 
infusion. 
8.3.2 Physical examinati
on 
A complete physical exami nat
ion will be performed at screening and at each study visit (before the 
infusion when NI-0501 is administe r
ed).  
Physical examination prior to each infusion may be performed in the late afternoon of the previous day 
instead of the morning of th e i
nfusion (the data will be captured on the infusion day of the CRF). 
At screening height (in cm), weight (in kg) and Body Surface Area (BSA) as calculated by [CONTACT_777571]. 
Subsequent physical exam i
nations will include i) recording of body we i ght prior to infusion and every 
2 weeks during the evaluation period for patients weighing less than 10 kg for patients weighing more 
than 10 kg, weight will be measured every 2 weeks throughout the study ; ii) abdominal palpation for 
assessment of liver and spleen size (in cm from costal grill) ; iii) follow-up of any abnormalities 
previously recorded as well as occurrence of new signs and symptoms. 
8.3.3 MAS clinical signs and symptoms  
The Investigator will  
be asked to provide his assessment of improvement/resolution of MAS signs and 
symptoms at the study timepoint s i
ndicated in the SoA. 
 
8.4 LABORATORY ASSESSMENTS 
Blood and urine laboratory ana
lyses are part of the routine monitoring of MAS patients, thus samples will 
be analyzed locally. Analyse s 
done on blood samples will favor as much as possible the use of micro-
sampling techniques. 
If additional safety laboratory samples are required for safety reasons, the number of samples will take 
into account the weight and healt h s
tatus of the patient. 
Laboratory assessments will be performed at each study visit and will include: 
 Hematology:  complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential count, a dedicated lymphocyte 
subset s 
count  (at screening and EoS visit ), and platelets .

(AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), gamma Glutamyl Transferase (γGT), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin, glucose, electrolytes, 
albumin, creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN).  
 Coagulation tests: activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), D-dimers and 
fibrinogen. 
 Urinalysi s
: glucose, blood, protein, leucocytes, ketones, pH and specific gravity. On SD0, 
urinalysis will be perf o
rmed before NI-0501 infusion (only if not already performed at 
screening). Urinalysis will be repeated at EoS.  
 Serum pregnancy test (if applicable) at screening and EoS. Additional pregnancy tests will be 
performed upon suspi[INVESTIGATOR_777503]
y or as mandated by [CONTACT_427], as long as NI-0501 
serum concentrations are detectable. 
8.5 SEARCH FOR INFECTIONS 
Search for infections that r
epresent exclusion criteria include the following pathogens: 
 Mycobacterium Tuberculosis   
At screening, it will  
be performed via IFNγ-release assay or PP D test. In addition, a baseline via 
polymerase chain reaction [PCR] in a relevant specimen (e.g., urine or blood, if sputum is not 
easily obtained) has to be obtained , as this test will be used during the course of the study to 
perform regular TB monitoring .    
After initiation of NI-[ADDRESS_1067929] be performed and 
combined with an IFNγ-release assay. 
 Atyp
ical mycobacteria , Shigella , Salmonella , Campyloba ct er, Histoplasma Capsulatum and 
Leishmania   
Search for all these pathogens have to be performed at screening. During the study, search for 
these pathogens has to be perfo r
med if there is any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_184010]. 
A first screening for Histoplasma Capsulatum may  be performed using galactomannan assay , 
however if the test is positive, confirmation should be obtained by [CONTACT_2329] a Histoplasma 
Capsulatum specific test. The presence of Leishmania  can be ascertained by [CONTACT_777530]. 
In addition, search for the following infections is  required:  
 Herpes Simplex Vi rus 
(HSV), Herpes Zoster Viru s (HZV), Hepatitis B Virus  (HBV ), Hepatitis C 
Virus  (HCV ), Human Immune Deficiency Virus  (HIV) by [CONTACT_184052], a t 
screening and whenever there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_184010]. 
 EBV, CMV, Adenoviruses by [CONTACT_956], at  screening and every 2 weeks as long as NI-
0501 is detectable in serum. 
A patient with a clinical assessment (including chest X-ray) not indicative of the presence of an active 
infection, provided that a
 usable specimen has been taken and the microbiological analysis is ongoing, 
can be enrolled prior to the availability of the results, if the patient’s clinical conditions require a rapid 
initiation of NI-0501 treatment.

8.6.1 Abdominal ultrasound 
Abdominal ultrasounds, includ i
ng liver and spleen (longitudinal) measurements, will be performed at 
screening and  every [ADDRESS_1067930] X-ray should be done more frequently in case of clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a 
pulmonary infection. 
8.6.3 Brain MRI 
Brain MRI should be performed i
n case of neurological symptoms occurrence, prior to NI-0501 initiation 
(or at latest by [CONTACT_66309]6), and re pea
ted at the end of the study, whenever possible. 
 
8.7 OTHER PROCEDURES 
8.7.1 ECG  
12-lead ECG will be perf or
med and interpreted locally by [CONTACT_777531].  
At sc r
eening, triplicate ECG (three consecutive recordings) is required in order to obtain a stable 
baseline. ECG is mandatory at screening, after the first NI-0501 infusion, and at the end of 
 the study, however it 
should also be performed whenever required based on clinical judgment. 
As part of the regulatory requirements for the overall assessment of NI-0501 safety profile, ECGs will be 
sent for evaluation to a c e
ntral laboratory designated by [CONTACT_777568], and results fully described in the 
Clinical Study Report. 
8.7.2 Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_777504] y
sis should be done in case of neurological symptoms occurrence , 
whenever possible and if c oag
ulation parameters allow, prior to NI-0501 initiation, during the course of 
the study and at the end of the study, as clinically indicated.  
 
8.8 PHAR MACOKINETIC/PHARMACODYNAMIC  A SSESSMENTS  
8.8.1 Pharmacokinetics 
Serum samples for PK an al
ysis will be collected at the visits indicated i n the SoA ( Table 1  and Table 2 ). 
In case of need for prioritization of blood analysis (considering weight and health status of the patient) , 
laboratory safety parameters (which would be done as normal disease monitoring ) may ne ed to be 
prioritized over samples for PK assessments, that in turn will be prioritized over biomarkers exploratory 
parameters.  
On the days of infusion, PK samples should be collected before and after (between 15 and 30 minutes 
after) the infusion.

and SD2 (around [ADDRESS_1067933]-infusion). Additionally, PK samples will be collected on SD5 (around 48 hrs. after the second NI-0501 infusion).
 
After completion of NI-0501 infusions, samples for PK assessment will be collected until serum NI-0501 
concentration are no longer detectable (or until consent is withdrawn), as indicated in the SoA until the EoS visit, and subsequently as described in Section 3.4 . 
In case of CNS involvement, if lumbar puncture is performed for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes, PK analysis in CSF samples may  be pe
rformed. 
Details on sample preparation and handling will be described in a separate laboratory manual.  
8.8.2 Pharmacodynamics 
Serum samples for PD analysis will be collected at the visits indicated in the SoA ( Table 1  and Table 2 ).  
In case of need for prioritization of blood analysis (considering weight and health status of the patient ), 
laboratory safety parameters and PK assessments will be prioritized over biomarkers exploratory parameters.  
Pharmacodynamics assessments include the measurement of: 
 Free IFN levels prior to NI- 0501 
 treatment start, and total IFNγ (free IFNγ+bound to NI-0501) 
during NI-[ADDRESS_1067934] infusion when free IFN  will be measured pre-dose and total 
IFNγ post-dose.  
 Chemokines known to be induced by [CONTACT_20129]γ (CXCL9, CXCL10). On infusion visits, serum 
samples will be collected pre-dose only. 
 Other potential disease biomarkers (e.g. sCD25, sCD163, IL-18, IL-10, IL-6, TNFCXCL11) . 
Serum sam pl
es will be collected on SD0 and every 2 weeks during the course of the study.   
In case of CNS involvement, if lumbar puncture is performed for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes, 
biomarker analysis in CSF sam pl
es may be performed. 
Details on sample preparation and handling will be described in a separate laboratory manual. 
8.8.3 Immunogenicity  
Serum samples for the assess m
ent of ADAs  will be collected on SD0 (pr i or to NI-0501 infusion) and at 
the End of Study visit, and in case of suspected loss of activity of NI-0501 during the study. Details on sample preparation and handling will be described in a separate laboratory manual. 
 
 
8.9 WITHDRAWAL VISIT 
The same procedures described for the EoS Visit should be followed by [CONTACT_777532] f r
om the study, as soon as possible after the decision to withdraw is made.  
For patients who withdraw from the study as a result of their own decision or the decision of their parent/guardian, the Investi g 
ator should contact [CONTACT_102] (or parent/guardian) and ask them to attend a 
withdrawal visit as soon as possible and in any case within 30 days from termination. 
Patients who are withdrawn due to a serious adverse event (SAE) should be follow ed-up until the 
resolution of  
the event or until the outcome of the event is known and stable.

Protocol NI-0501- 06  Version 1.0 US – October 19 , 2017        CONFIDENTIAL 8.10 UNPLANNED (UNSCHEDUL ED) VISITS 
Unplanned visits may occur, should the patient need to be assess ed or treat ed for any clini cal condition 
that arises during the study. This may include the evaluation and follow-up of AEs, SAEs or laboratory 
tests. The assessments (as detailed in the SoA ) should always be performed at minimum , but additional 
evaluations may be added according to the clinical judgment of the Investigator. 
8.10.1  Unplanned Assessments 
Additional samples to as se
ss laboratory parameters and PK/PD may be required for safety reasons and/or 
for a better characteriz at
ion of the PK/PD profile.  
The number of additional samples taken will depend on the body weight and health status of the patient. Sampling schedule will be proposed by  t 
he Sponsor and discussed with the Investigator.  
9 STUDY SCIENTIFIC OVERSIGHT 
A Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) composed of international experts in pediatric rheumatology as 
well as in HLH has been involved in the preparation of study design and protocol writing. The SSC is also to be consulted for t he 
 composition of the independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(iDMC).  
The SSC will continue to play an advisory role throughout the course of the study, including the support 
to the iDMC oversight, and w i
ll perform evaluations of the data to support the Sponsor in the 
interpretation of the results of the study.  
Please refer to Appendix C for full details of membershi p of  the SSC. 
10 SAFETY MONITORING 
10.1 INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE 
The iDMC, composed of relevant experts (pediatric rheumatologist, pediatric onco-hematologist with 
experience in HLH, pediatri c 
immunodeficiency/infectious disease specialist, bio-statistician and a 
specialist in ethics), will over see the study, with particular regard to the evaluation of safety parameters 
and benefit/risk profile of NI-0501, reviewing all data generated on an ongoing basis with the aim to 
ensure that patients are not exposed to unnecessary risks.  Some of the iDMC members have been already 
involved in the oversight of the ongoing NI-0501 studies.  Please refer to Section 10.5.1  for further 
details on the iDMC. 
10.2 DESCRIPTION OF SAFETY PARAMETERS 
Evaluation of NI-0501 tolerability and safety will be based on the following parameters: 
Adverse events (AEs), with special attention being paid to events temporally related to theinfusion of NI-0501 (occur r 
ing during the infusions and within [ADDRESS_1067935] infusion) and to the
occurrence of infections
Laboratory parameters, as described in Section 8.4
Vital signs, as described in Section 8.3.1

baseline, and to any emergent new signs or symptoms (see Section 8.3.2  for more details).  
 
10.3 RECORDING AND REPORTING SAFETY PARAMETERS  
10.3.1   Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) are def
ined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during the study, 
whether or not considered r
elated to the IMP. All AEs reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_777533]/her 
relatives or observed by [CONTACT_777534].   
Medical conditions present at screening (before ICF signature) should be recorded in the medical history 
section of the CRF. 
All AEs wil l
 be reported in the appropriate section of the CRF. 
An AE which occurs between start of screening visit (after ICF signature) and start of first IMP 
administration will be consider ed
 as a pre-treatment AE.  
Any AE that occurs after the start of the first IMP administration will be considered in the study as 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Event  (
TEAE). 
However, if a pre-existing medical condition recorded in the medical history worsens (clinically 
significant change in int e
nsity or frequency), it must be recorded as an AE in the CRF and, depending on 
the time of its occurrence, will be considered as a pre-treatment AE or a TEAE. If a medical condition, 
recorded as a pre-treatment AE, worsens it will be recorded in the CRF as a separate TEAE. 
For each AE, the following will be assessed and recorded: intensity, relationship to the IMP, action taken 
regarding the IMP, any treatment recei
ved for the event and outcome of AE to date.  
Intensity of AEs will be graded on a three-points scale (mild, moderate, severe) using the modified WHO (World Health Organiza t 
ion) toxicity scale (Grade 3 and 4 are considered to be the severe grade). If AE 
severity cannot be assessed by [CONTACT_777535], assessment by [CONTACT_777536]: 
• Mild: discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal activity, 
• Moderate: discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, • Severe: inability to work or perform normal daily activity. 
For a given AE, the asses sm
ent of its intensity should reflect the highest grade (on the 3 points scale 
mentioned above) reported during  
its course (except when the intensity of a pre-treatment AE increases 
after treatment initiation, as indicated above).  
The relationship of the AE to the IMP will be assessed by [CONTACT_12214] a “Yes/No” 
classification. A “Yes” rel
ationship infers that there is a reasonable possibility of causal relationship 
between the AE and IMP. The expression “reasonable possibility” is meant to convey that there are facts, 
evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. Conversely, a “No” relationship infers that there 
is no reasonable possibility of causal relationship between the AE and IMP. Usually it implies that other possible causes have been identified.  
In this study NI-0501 is the only IMP.

Protocol NI-0501- 06  Version 1.0 US – October 19 , 2017        CONFIDENTIAL 10.3.2  Serious Adverse Events 
An adverse event is considered serious if it: 
results in death (note: death is an outcome, not an event);
is life-threatening; (note: the term "life-threatening" refers to an event in which the patient
was at immediate risk of  
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which
could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe);
requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928];
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or requirehospi [INVESTIGATOR_777505] i 
dered serious when, based upon appropriate medical
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events includeallergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blooddyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of
drug dependency or drug abuse.
For the purposes of this study, the following will not be considered as serious adverse events: 
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_184016] a result of a patient’s pre-existi ng
condi
tion(s) which has (have) not worsened since receiving IMP. Such events should still be
recorded as adverse events in the eCRF;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_184017]-0501infusion and study visits.
Any serious adverse event (SA E) 
that occurs during the course of the study, irrespective of the treatment 
received by [CONTACT_3184] r eg
ardless of causality to the study drug, must be communicated by [CONTACT_184065], by [CONTACT_777538], within [ADDRESS_1067936] informati on for SAE reporting: 
Fax:  
E-mail:
Relevant follow-up information on SAEs should be forwarded to Novimmune as soon as it becomes 
available. In addition, the Investigator should answer without delay any request for follow-up information 
or questions Novimmune team may have regarding the reported SAE. 
All SAEs must be recorded as an AE in the CRF. They should be reviewed, evaluated and followed 
through to resolution (or stabiliz
ation) by [CONTACT_737] . 
For any new SAE, the following minimum information is required in the initial report: 
Clear identification of the Investigator, with full contact [CONTACT_777539]
Subject’s identification details (study number, site number, subject’s unique study identification
number and date of birth),
IMP administ r
ation details (dose and dates)

is not available) and the date of onset,  
 Seriousness criteria. 
In addition causal relationshi
p (Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) of the event with the IMP or with the study 
procedure (e.g. the causality according  t
o the Investigator during screening) should be provided whenever 
possible in this initial report, otherwise it must be included in a follow-up report.  
The Sponsor will also conduct its own assessment on seriousness and causality of all recorded AEs 
during the study. If the Sponsor
 becomes aware of an AE, which has not been reported by [CONTACT_776377], but is assessed by [CONTACT_777540] (e.g. medically important), the 
Investigator  will be asked to report such AEs to the Sponsor as  an SAE, according to the timelines and 
rules described above.  
10.3.3   S[LOCATION_003]R reporting 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse  
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are adverse events that are both serious and 
unexpected (i.e. as per the I n
vestigator’s Brochure), and are considered, by [CONTACT_223493], to have a reasonable possibility of causal relationship between the administered IMP and the 
adverse event.  
Some of the SAEs reported by [CONTACT_777541], and such need to be reported in 
an expedited manner by [CONTACT_13099]
r to Health Authorities and Central Ethics Committees/Independent 
Ethics Committees/ Research Ethics Boards.  
Under 21 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 312.32(c), the Sponsor (directly or through a delegated third 
party) is required to not i
fy the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and all participating Investigators in 
an IND safety report (i.e., 7- or 15-day expedited report) of potentially serious risks from clinical trials or any other source as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor receives the safety information and determines that the information qualifies for reporting. 
Investigators in the US are required to promptly report to the IRB all unanticipated problems involving 
risk to human subjects or ot
hers, including AEs that should be considered unanticipated problems (21 
CFR 312.66), such as IND safety reports. 
For Canada, the sponsor is required to inform Health Canada of any serious, unexpected adverse drug 
reaction that has occurr
ed inside or outside Canada. An adverse drug report must be filed in the cases 
where the adverse drug reaction is neither fatal nor life-threatening, within [ADDRESS_1067937] values should not be reported as AEs unless specific treatment is given for the 
abnormality (e.g. a blood transfusi o
n is given for a low haemoglobin ) or a laboratory abnormality leads to 
furth er investigation and the diagnosis of a new clinical event (e.g. a high white blood cell count is found 
to be due to incidental leukaemia ). In this latter event , the clinical diagnosis should be reported on the AE 
form, not the laboratory abnormality leadi ng to the diagnosis . Clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
test value can be qualified as important medical events ( see Section 10.3.2 ) and should then follow the 
process described in this se ct
ion.

10.4 FOLLOW-UP OF SAFETY PA R AMET ERS  
10.4.1   Treatment and Follow-up of Adverse Events 
Adverse events, especially  
those for which the relationship to the study drug has been assessed as ‘Yes’, 
should be followed-up until the ev
ent has returned to baseline status or has stabil ised. If a clear 
explanation is established, it should be recorded on the CRF.  
All SAEs must be followed-up until the event has either resolved or reached a stable clinical outcome. 
10.4.[ADDRESS_1067938] returned to within normal range and/or an 
adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. If a clear explanation is establ ished, it should be 
recorded on the eCRF . 
10.4.[ADDRESS_1067939] be reported to Novimmune within 24 
hours of awareness. This i nc
ludes pregnancies occurring in partners of male enrolled patients. All 
information pertaining to the pregnancy should be reported using the Novimmune Pregnancy form 
provided to the investigators. Pregnancies should be followed until conclusion to obtain outcome information. 
Occurrence of a pregnancy in a study participant will preclude any further IMP administration.  
If the patient is withdrawn from the study, the assessments presented in the Schedule of Assessments for 
EoS are to be performed (see Sec 
tion 8.9 ). 
10.5 BENEFIT/RISK MANAGEMENT 
10.5.1  Safety Surveillance Management 
The main responsibility of
 the DMC is to review all safety and efficacy data as they are generated to 
ensure that no patient is ex pose
d to unnecessary risk and to continuously assess the benefit/risk profile of 
NI-0501.  
The DMC can recommend treatment discontinuation for individual patients as well as to halt the entire 
study temporarily or permane nt
ly. Predefined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_184018]. For 
more details, see stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_112576] 11. 
10.5.2   General Benefit/Risk Considerations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Poten tial benefits 
Patients p r
esenting MAS secondary to sJIA may not respond to systemic glucocorticoids and have 
limited alternative t h
erapeutic options. These options are represented by [CONTACT_777542], and administration of CsA or chemotherapy such as etoposide, all options carrying an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. For those non-responders patients, an alternate therapy 
should aim to obtain remission of MAS with none or limited safety issues.   
Three elements strongly suggest that the use of NI-0501 would enable MAS remission: 
Page 128 of 150
Study NI- 0501- 06 NI-0501 in MAS/sHLH in sJIA patients Page 52 of 73 
Protocol NI-0501- 06                              Version 1.0 US – October 19 , 2017        CONFIDENTIAL - In animal model mimicking MAS, administration of an anti-IFNγ enables the recovery/remission of 
the signs and symptoms associated with hypercytokinemia  
- Observational studies have shown a strong correlation between biomarkers (IFNγ as well as IFNγ- 
induc ed c
hemokines) and disease parameters at MAS onset and during disease evolution. 
According to the data collected to date  in pHLH patients (ongoing NI -0501 -04 study),  NI-[ADDRESS_1067940] Investigator’s Brochure . 
Based on these considerations, sJIA patients with MAS having inadequately responded to systemic high 
dose glucocorticoids are ex pec
ted to benefit from a targeted therapy with NI-0501 aiming at neutralizing 
IFNγ and achieving MAS remission.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risks analysis 
 Risks related t o N
I-0501  
NI-0501 is a fully human IgG1monoclonal antibody (mAb). 
Upon the administration o f
 mAbs, which are proteins, acute infusion reactions can occur. These may 
happen during the infusion or in the  sub
sequent hours (usually within the first 24 hours)43,44.  
These reactions are either IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylactic reactions), or 
anaphylactoid reactions not  
mediated by [CONTACT_29763]. True anaphylactic reactions usually do not occur upon 
initial infusion and require a certain sensitization. In contrast, the pathophysiology of anaphylactoid 
reactions appears to be secondary to the release of cytokines consequent to a mAb binding to circulating 
antigen-expressing cells. However, the clinical manifestations of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions overlap, and both may lead to life-threatening conditions, involving cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], central nervous, gastro-intestinal, and cutaneous systems. The management of anaphylactic and 
anaphylactoid reactions involves immediate administration of oxygen, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], vasopressors, 
bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and/or antihistamin es.  
More than [ADDRESS_1067941] been administered to HLH patients (either in the context of the NI-0501-[ADDRESS_1067942] received NI-0501 in compassionate use) up to and 
including the dose of 10 mg/kg, without any serious or severe infusion related reaction reported. In less 
than 2% of infusions, mild or moderate transient erythematous rashes localized to the extremities (feet 
and/or hands) have been reported in a few patients. They occurred in most of the cases during the first 
infusions of NI-[ADDRESS_1067943] mAb therapeutics elicit some level of antibody response (anti-drug 
antibodies or ADAs) against  
the therapeutic product, as early as after the first exposure. No sign of 
immunogenicity has been reported in the NI-0501 study in healthy volunteers. The presence of ADAs  
will be measured during this study as per regulatory recommendations, and the analysis is planned to be 
performed at the end of the NI-0501-06 study, unless PK or safety concerns possibly related to 
immunogenicity would justify an interim analysis.  Data accumulated so far (in particular PK profiles and

The impact on the imm un
e defense  caused by [CONTACT_184067]γ is known from patien ts with 
inborn errors of the IL -12/23 -IFN-γ circuit, particularly patients with complete or partial IFNγ receptor 
(R) deficiency, and subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_184019]-IFNγ antibodies . 
Patients with IFNγ R deficiency are prone to developi[INVESTIGATOR_653400], although to a 
lesser extent, Salmonell a 
infections45,46. The mean age of the first environmental mycobacterial infection 
is 3.1 and 13.4 years in patients with complete and partial deficiency, respectively47. No systematic 
prophylaxis has been recommended in these patients. 
If an infection occurs, appropriate antibiotherapy based on sensitivity of isolated species is prescribed. 
Individuals with anti -IFNγ auto-antibodies are also susceptible to develop mycobacterial infections (for 
the vast majority atypi[INVESTIGATOR_184020]), but also opportunistic infections (e.g. by 
[CONTACT_184068], S almonella , Herpes  Zoster  virus  infections )4.   
Toxicological studies carried out with NI-[ADDRESS_1067945] prior to NI-0501 administration. Presence of infections due to Shigella, Salmonella and 
Campylobacter  is part of the exclusion criteria. 
A reactivation of Herpes Zoster  virus afte r  the single NI-0501 infusion at 3 mg/kg, was observed in one 
healthy volunteer in the NI-0510-03 study with a non-uneventful course and full recovery.   
Preliminary data on infections collected in patients treated with NI-0501 to date allow the f o llowing 
conclusions to be drawn:   
- Active infections, in particular bacterial and viral infections (among them EBV or CMV infections, 
which are often the trigg er
 of the HLH), were present at the first administration of NI-0501in some of 
them. During NI-[ADDRESS_1067946] line or after a limited exposure to glucocorticoids or chemotherapy seem to 
develop less infections du r
ing the course of NI-0501.  
- Systematic search for tuberculosis was negative and no atypi[INVESTIGATOR_777506]. Stool/b l 
ood cultures were negative for Salmonella , Shigella  or Campylobacter  in all 
patients. No Herpes Zoster  infection has been reported. 
- Only one infection reported (disseminated histoplasmosis in a patient with a severely compromised immune status and suspected t 
o carry the pathogen prior to the administration of NI-0501) was 
reported as a serious adverse reaction as it is one of the few pathogens known to be favored by [CONTACT_20129] γ 
neutralization. However the patient recovered from it rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777507]. 
- The severity and duration of neutropenia, a hallmark of HLH as well as a potential consequence of 
previous HLH treatments, see m
ed to contribute significantly to the development of infections.

 Risk related to the study population 
Most of the patients ar e 
expected to have already received at least glucocorticoid treatments as well as 
having possibly been previously  
treated by [CONTACT_777544][INVESTIGATOR_014], some of them for a relatively long 
time depending on the duration of their underlying rheumatic disease; therefore they may carry variable 
degree of toxicities caused by [CONTACT_184069] . The data collected to date in pHLH patients who have 
been heavily pretreated by [CONTACT_44859]-chemotherapy show that administration of NI-[ADDRESS_1067948] on HLH activity.  
All information collected on disease severity and prev i ous treatments will be taken into account for the 
analysis of adverse events.  
Toxicities of concomitant treatments, authorized or recommended during the administration of NI-0501, 
may also potentially expos e 
the patients to adverse events; however their benefits may outweigh their 
risks. No safety concern related to the concomitant administration of NI -0501 with other treatments (e.g., 
antimicrobial agents, anti -hypertensive drugs) has been reported so far. Corticosteroids  have already been 
administered with anti-IFNγ therapy in Crohn’s Disease without any particular safety concerns48. Of 
interest, tapering of glucocorticoids had no impact on safety and tolerability of NI -[ADDRESS_1067949] clinical 
practice at the participating sites. The risks of administering alternate therapy after having received NI-
0501 seems to be low, since no particular safety concerns were observed during treatment with NI-0501. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risk minimization measures 
In
 view of the expected benefits and previous experience gathered with patients exposed to NI-[ADDRESS_1067950]’s risk is provided 
below: 
 Study designed with rheumatologists experienced in the treatment of sJIA and MAS, forming the SSC. 
 Patients are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] i
n specialized centers for the treatment of MAS, and therefore with 
all necessary emergency assi s
tance equipment. 
 Inclusion/exclusion criteria: patients with malformations or severely altered functions (either due to the disease stage or  
to a concomitant disease), as well as patients with evidence of 
patent or latent TB infections  or active mycobacteria , Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter,  
Histoplasma Capsulatum or Leishmania  infections, will not be included in the study (for 
details see Section 4.1 ).  
 Although unlikely to be observed based on preliminary results gathered from patients treated 
with NI-0501 up to 10mg/kg , 
Infusion Related Reactions (IRRs) will be detected and 
managed in due time through patients’ monitoring during and after drug infusions. Each of 
the specialized centers will have physicians adequately trained in IRR management. 
 Recommendations on prophylaxis for Herpes Zoster virus for all patients and Tuberculosis 
for a defined subpopulation (
see Section 6.2 ) in the protocol to avoid occurrence of these 
infections.

continue after NI-0501 discontinuation as long as serum NI-0501 levels are detectable. 
 Close monitoring of potential infections through careful physical examination, laboratory 
parameters, active search fo r
 EBV, CMV, Adenoviruses, detection of tuberculosis  
 Study safety surveillance by [CONTACT_777545], identify signals for early detection of safety 
concerns and propose mitigat i
ng actions. It will be part of the study documentation shared with

11 STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_16442] 
11.1 AT PATIENT LEVEL 
11.1.1  Investigator’s or Patient’s  Decision to Discontinue 
An Investigator can decide at any time during the study to discontinue the treatment for an individual 
patient based on his/her ow
n medical judgment, taking into account the individual benefit risk ratio for 
his/her patient. In addition, the patient (or their legal representative) can decide at any time to withdraw 
from the study.  
In any case the decision to withdraw or be withdr a wn will have no impact on the patient’s care and 
further treatments administered to him/her after withdrawal.  Patients who are withdrawn from the study will receive alternative treatments according to the standard 
of care at the site. 
 
11.1.2  Deci
sion to Discontinue Treatment due to Safety Reason or Lack of Efficacy 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatm ent Discontinuation f or a Safety Reason 
A patient must be discontinued from study treatment if a SAE occurring after NI-0501 administration is: 
1. considered by [CONTACT_777572] t o N I-0501 (with guidance from the iDMC if needed)  
AND  
2. is a life-threatening event. 
All other AEs will be j
udged by [CONTACT_105271] a case- by-case basis taking into ac coun t the disease 
evolution (such as signs of improvement in HLH) and the possibility of managing the AE and ensuring 
that no patient is exposed to unnecessary risks. 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Treatment Discontinuation f or La ck of Efficacy 
A patient should be discontinued from study treatment for lack of efficacy in the event of any of the 
followings: 
- Rapid worseni ng
 of MAS representing immediate risk for the patient and requiring the use 
of a salvage therapy.   
- No Response t o
 NI-0501, provided that there is evidence of IFNg neutralization.

alternatives, the iDMC can authorize it after a thorough review of the patient’s data and confirmation of 
lack of risks for the patient.  
 
11.1.3  Systemic and local reaction to NI-0501 infusion 
In case of clinical r
elevant changes in vital signs compared to pre-infusion values, the rate of NI-0501 
infusion may be decreased or 
the infusion temporarily interrupted, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_3786].  
A decision to definitely stop the infusion should only be taken in case of very severe systemic reactions 
and be based on the evolution of pa
tient status after appropriate symptomatic measures, e.g. oxygenation, 
and upon physician’s own medical judgment.  
All changes in the infusion rate should be recorded on the Infusion Worksheet: each t i me with the rate 
modification.  
Unless related to a hypersensitivity reaction, the occurrence of local issues related to the infusion (such as 
catheter displacement, obstructi on o
r product extravasation) should be managed through the identification 
of a new venous access as soon as possible to complete the infusion. All relevant information needs to be recorded in the Infusion Worksheet, including the volume of IMP potentially lost (in order to calculate the quantity of drug infused), and the time at which the infusion was stopped and restarted.  
 
11.2 AT STUDY LEVEL 
11.2.1  Suspension of  Recruitment 
Recruitm ent
 may be suspended in the following situations: 
 Any occurrence of death or life-threatening SAE related to the drug  
 At the iD MC’s own request as an outcome of the i r regular study review. 
Patients already enrolled in the study should continue receiving NI-0501 as per protocol unless decided 
otherwise by [CONTACT_737] .
 
The suspension will allow the iDMC to analyse  the data already generated and consi der a 
recommendation.  
After re-evaluation of benefit/risk profile, the iDMC may recommend any of the following:  
 To resume recruitment without any change 
 To implement minimisation  measures t hat may require protocol amendment  
 To implement conditions for study termination, e.g. next occurrence of a particular serious drug reaction or at the next pati
ent worsening or reactivation 
11.2.2  Study Termination 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Study Termination for 
Safety Reason 
Occurrence of two dea t
hs suggesting a reasonably possible relationship with continuous exposure to NI-
0501 and occurring in similar condi t
ions will trigger the decision to terminate the study. 
This process will involve both the DMC and the Investigator . The management of patients already 
enrolled in the study will also be part of t he DMC recommendations .

The decision to terminate the study due to absence of a demonstrated benefit will be one of the 
responsibilities of the  
iDMC, based on the ongoing review of the individual patient data and benefit/risk 
analysis. 
In case of study termination, the management of the patients already enrolled in the study will also be 
part of the iDMC recommendati
ons. 
12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN 
Full details of all planned analyses will be specified in separate documents describing PK/PD and 
Statistical Analyses, which will be finalized prior to the locking of the study database. This section 
contains an overview of the planned methods of analysis with regard to safety and efficacy variables. 
12.1 SAMPLE SIZE   
The sample size of 5 pa t
ients is based on pragmatic considerations, and on the experience acquired from 
primary HLH patients treated wit
h NI-0501. 
12.2 ANALYSIS SETS   
All analysis sets wil l
 be defined prior to final database closure. In addition to the analysis sets listed 
below, further exploratory anal
yses may be performed using other subgroups of patients. 
12.2.1  Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set w i
ll include all patients who receive any part of an infusion of study drug. 
12.2.2  Intent- to-Treat Analysis Set 
The in t
ent-to-treat (ITT) analysis se t  will coincide with the Safety Analysis Set. 
12.2.[ADDRESS_1067952] 
deviation, minimum and maximu m
 values. For binary data (proportions of patients showing a defined 
variable) the numbers and percentages will be tabulated.  
All study variables are considered to be exploratory in this study, and no hierarchy of endpoints has been 
specified, as the objective
 of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_777490]. 
Analysis will focus on descriptive statistics and confidence intervals. As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], statistical 
methods will focus on summari
zing the data collected using descriptive statistics and on appropriate 
graphical presentations.

Protocol NI-0501- 06                              Version 1.0 US – October [ADDRESS_1067953] features, e.g. fever; 
splenomegaly; WBC; plat
elet counts; liver function test (in particular ALT/AST); fibrinogen; ferritin; 
LDH.  
For binary endpoints (MAS remission by [CONTACT_10585] 8, number of patients who taper glucocorticoids, number 
of patients who discontinu e due t
o lack of efficacy), 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for 
proportions. 
For time to event endpoints (time to MAS remission, time to achievement of glucocorticoids tapering and 
time to death), Kaplan- Me
ier curves will be calculated and summary statistics, such as medians, 
proportions event-free at various time points will be calculated and presented, and 95% confidence 
intervals calculated where possible.  
12.3.[ADDRESS_1067954]. 
In addition, other exploratory analyses of safety data, including summaries for different subsets of 
patients, may be conducted. 
12.3.3  Pharmacodynam i
c Data 
All PD data will be summari
zed using appropriate graphical and tabular presentations. 
Exploratory statistical models will be fitted, and correlation analyses undertaken, to investigate the 
relationships between PD d at
a and clinical measures of response. ROC curves may be used to summarize 
any relationships that are found. 
In addition, other exploratory analyses of pharmacodynamic endpoints, including summaries for different 
subsets of patients, may be conducted. 
12.3.4  Imm
unogenicity Data 
The numbers of patients with ant i
-drug antibodies present at each assessment point will be summarized. 
12.3.5  Missing Data 
No imputations of missi ng
 data will be performed. However, the following rules will be applied to ensure 
that all patients can be incl uded i
n the final analysis:  
- patients who are withdrawn from the study prior to Week 8 because of safety concerns or 
poor efficacy will be cl
assified as non-responders from the time of their withdrawal in all 
analyses of response status, and their data will be censored at time of withdrawal in all time-
to-event analyses. For continuous endpoints in such patients, all analyses for time points 
beyond the point of withdrawal will exclude missing data for these patients.

this study are designed t o
 ensure that Novimmune, its authori zed representative, and Inve stigator abide 
by [CONTACT_23663] (GCP), as described in International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles grounded  in the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The study will receive approval from an IRB/ IEC prior to commencement and where applicable 
by [CONTACT_772522]. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study 
in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory author ities.  
13.2 INVESTIGATOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Investigator  
must ensure that all persons assisting with the trial are appropriately qualified and 
adequately informed about the pr
otocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties 
and functions and should ensure this is appropriately documented in the site file. The Investigator should maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study-related duties. 
The Investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all patients (or their legally authorised  
representative) who sign an informed consent document and are screened for entry into the study. 
Patients who fail screening must have the reason(s) recorded in their source documents and the study -
screening log.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigators’ staff, must be available during monitoring 
visits, audits and inspect i
ons to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to patients’ records 
(e.g. medical/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study related charts) for source data and 
other type of verification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and 
queries. The Investigator must make himself/herself personally available during at least one monitoring visit per month, in order to address questions and to generally demonstrate his/her direct oversight of the conduct of the study. 
The Investigator must allow regular visits at the site when patients are enrolled, to be not less than one 
 [ADDRESS_1067957] 30 days after a study day. 
13.3 CONSENT 
Before being admitted to t
he clinical study, the patient or the patient’s legally  authorized representative 
must consent to participate after the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the clinical study have been explained in a manner understandable to him or her. An informed consent document that includes 
both information about the study and the consent form will be prepared and given to the patient. This 
document will contain all ICH, GCP, and locally required regulatory elements (whichever is more stringent). The informed consent will be translated in a language understandable to the patient, as required by [CONTACT_777548], and must specify who informed the patient, and when the 
informed consent was obtained.

Protocol NI-0501- 06                              Version 1.0 US – October 19 , 2017        CONFIDENTIAL Information to patients will be split into a Patient Information Sheet that provides detailed information 
about the trial and its benefits and risks, and the Informed Consent Form that summarises  the content of 
the Patient Information Sheet and is used to o btain the dated signature [CONTACT_184101]’s agreement to partake in the study.  
If applicable, since minors are involved in the trial, assent must be obtained from the minor and informed consent from at least one of t he pa 
rents or as mandated by [CONTACT_184074] (individual or judicial or other body 
authori zed under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective patient to the patient’s participation 
in the procedures involved in the research). The language used in the Assent For m is adapted to the 
maturity level of the minor involved in the trial. Since minors of different age groups are likely to be entered into the trial different versions of the Assent Form will be provided. The modalities for obtaining informed consent from t he parents and Assent from the minor will be defined at the site initiation visit 
and documented at the clinical trial center. 
The Investigator, or designee, will obtain consent for participation in the study in writing . The written 
informed consent will b e obtained prior to conducting any study -related procedures or tests , although 
procedures or tests that are done as a part of routine medical care and conducted before consent can be used for the purposes of screening . The patient’s consent (or the consent  of the patient’s legally 
authori zed representative) must be confirmed at the time of consent by [CONTACT_777549]. A copy of the signed consent document must be given to the patient or  their legally authori zed representative. The Investigator  will retain the original 
signed consent document.  
If an amended protocol impacts the content of the informed consent document, the consent document 
must be revised. Patients a l
ready participating in the study when the amended protocol is implemented 
must be re-consented with the revised version of the informed consent document , if the changes impact 
the continued participation of that patient . A copy of the revised informed consent document must be  
given to the patient or their legally authorised  representative. The Investigator will retain the original 
signed updated consent document in the study files. 
13.4 CONFIDENTIALITY AND DATA PRIVACY 
Novimmune affirms the pa
tient's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in compliance 
with ICH and other local  
regulations (whichever is more stringent). Novimmune requires the Investigator 
to permit Novimmune representatives and when necessary, representatives from regulatory authorities, to 
review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws (any copi[INVESTIGATOR_190213]’ records must be duly anonymi zed to protect patients’ confidentiality).  
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorisation  separate from the patient’s 
statement of informed consent, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the appropriate individual.  
13.5 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS 
Substantial amendments will  
be submitted to the IRB/IEC for written approval and where applicable to 
National Competent Authori t
ies. Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the 
amended version occurs unless the amendment is implemented to increase safety measures for the patients in the study. The written signed approval from the IRB/ IEC should specifically reference the 
Principal Investigator’s name, protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is/are 
applicable.

Before the start of the study, the study protocol, informed consent document, and any other appropriate 
documents will be submitted to 
the IRB/IEC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents 
submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorities in accordance with local legal requirements. 
Novimmune can only supply study drug to an Investigator after Novimmune or their authorise d 
representative has received documentation on all ethical and legal requirements for starting the study. 
This documentation must also include a list of the members of the IRB/ IEC and their occupation and 
qualifications. If the IRB/ IEC will not disclose th e names of the committee members, it should be asked 
to issue a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. Formal 
approval by [CONTACT_1201]/ IEC should  preferably  mention the study title, study code, study site, and any other 
documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be officially 
signed by a committee member (chairman or secretary of the IRB/ IEC). Before the first patient is 
enrolled at a given  study  site, all ethical and legal requirements must be met.  
The IRB/IEC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol amendments in accordance with local legal  r
equirements. Amendments must be evaluated to determine whether formal 
approval must be sought and whether the informed consent document should also be revised. 
The Investigator must keep a record of all communication with the IRB/IEC and, if applicable, between a 
coordinating Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_72616]/IEC. This statement also applies to any communication between 
the Investigator (or coordinating Investigator, if applicable) and regulatory authorities. 
All documents handed over to patients or their legal representative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_777574] R eg
ulatory Authorities and to IRB/IEC. This includes but is not limited to 
the informed consent form, patient information sheet, assent form, advertisements, training materials, etc. 
13.7 ONGOING INFORMATION FOR IRB/IEC 
If required by [CONTACT_777551]  t
he IRB/IEC, the investigat or must submit to the IRB/ IEC: 
 Information on SAEs or S[LOCATION_003]Rs as per local applicable rules and timelines;  
 Periodic reports on the progress of the study; 
 Deviations from the protocol or anything that may involve added risk to patient s. 
13.8 CLOSURE OF THE STUDY 
Novimmune reserves the ri g
ht to terminate this study at any time for reasonable medical or administrative 
reasons. Any premature disc ont
inuation will be appropriately documented according to local 
requirements (e.g ., IRB/IEC, Regulatory Authorities).  
In addition, the Investigator or Novimmune has the right to discontinue a single site at any time during the study for medical or admi ni 
strative reasons such as: 
 Lack of screening or recruiting activities  
 Significant non-compliance with contractual enrolment timelines and targets 
 Persistent GCP non-compliance 
 Inaccurate, incomplete or delayed data collection 
 Persistent failure to adhere to the study protocol 
 Persistent failure to provide requested follow-up information for data queries

14 MONITORING AND AUDITING 
All aspects of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_777576] 
(Novimmune authorised  representative), for compliance with applicable government regulations with 
respect to current GCP and standard operating procedures. Direct access to the on -site study 
documentation and medical records must be ensured.  
14.[ADDRESS_1067960] available for monitoring, adequate case records (accurate source documents and 
CRFs) for the patients treated under this prot ocol. In addition, the investigator  agrees to maintain all 
administrative documents (e.g. IEC correspondence, investigational product and supplies shipment 
manifests, monitoring logs, or correspondence with Nov immune and with any of its representative for 
this study).  
14.2 ON-SITE AUDITS 
Investigators and insti t
utions involved in the study will permit trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC 
review, and domestic or forei g
n regulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_184081], 
CRFs, and all other study documentation. 
The Investigator should promptly notify Novimmune of any inspections scheduled by [CONTACT_777577] d 
to Novimmune copi[INVESTIGATOR_183053]. 
14.3 SERIOUS GCP BREACHES 
Novimmune is required to r
eport a serious GCP Breach within 7 days to applicable health authorities. 
Therefore, should an Investi g
ator become aware of a possible serious GCP breach, e.g. a protocol

15.1 DOCUMENTATION OF STUDY RESULTS 
A CRF (including electronic data capture) is used in this study and a specific CRF will correspond to 
each patie nt.  
All required infor m
ation must be entered on the CRFs. If an item is not available or is not applicable, this 
fact should be indicated a n
d no blank spaces must be left. The data collected on the CRF will be entered 
into the study database. If the inves tigator authorises  other personnel to enter data into the CRF, the 
names, positions, signatures, and initials of these persons must be supplied to Nov immune or their 
authorised  representative before these individuals start completing CRF information.  
The CRF must be reviewed by [CONTACT_184083] a designated sub-investigator, and final si g 
nature will be required.  
15.2 USE OF COMPUTERI ZED SYS TEMS AT T H E CLINICAL TRIAL CENT ER 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’ s computeriz ed medical record 
system (i.e. in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document 
if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to 
computeriz ed systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computeriz ed data collection system 
allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_33508], and date of the change. 
The system must allow the clinical research associate, auditors or inspectors to verify source data without 
infringing privacy ri g 
hts of other patients, e.g. access must be restricted to records pertaining to the study 
patients and access to other patients must not be possible.

 1. Infection:  including concomitant active or recurrent chronic bacterial, fungal 
or viral infection at presentation; nor underlying infection which may mimic 
initial presentation of sJIA3 
 2.  Malignancy3   
 3. Positive screening  test for TB without documented past treatment  
 4. Prior treatment for SJIA other than NSAIDs or short term steroids4 
 5. Immunization with live virus vaccines within the [ADDRESS_1067964] at some point e xhibit a quotidia n fever pattern, defined as fever 
that rises to ≥39°C at least once a day and returns to ≤37°C between fever peaks.  
2Swelling within a joint, or limitation in the range of joint movement with joint pain or tenderness, is 
observed by a physician, and which  is not due to primarily mechanical disorders or to other identifiable 
causes.  
3 Infections, malignancy and other diagnoses which can present with similar symptoms as sJIA should be 
excluded before initiating treatment plans for new onset sJIA in order to  avoid unintended adverse 
effects of the treatment plans if used for other diagnoses.  
4 Prior treatment with steroids should not exceed 2 weeks of oral steroids, and/or 3 pulses of 
methylprednisolone. Prior treatment with IVIG for possible Kawasaki Disease  is allowed. Duration of 
NSAIDs is without restriction.  
 
NOTE: The above is not meant to represent diagnostic nor classification criteria for sJIA. The 
differences between this operational case definition and the ILAR criteria are:  
1. ILAR specifies that the duration of quotidian  fever has to be 3 days (the total duration of fever is 
two weeks in both) . 
2. ILAR specifies six weeks’ duration of arthritis . 
3. Psoriasis, positive RF, arthritis in HLA B27 positive male after 6 years of age, family history of 
AS, IBD wit h sacroiliitis, acute anterior uveitis and reactive arthritis are listed as exclusions in 
the ILAR definition .

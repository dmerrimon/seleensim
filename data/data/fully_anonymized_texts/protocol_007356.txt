 Study Design  / Methods / Procedures  
 
This study is an open -label, single site, crossover trial comparing Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_557966], comfort, and preference. The 
proposed sample size is 42 subjects allowing for 10% dropout during patient s creening.  
 
2 Visits: Screening visit and Study visit  
 
Screening visit  (approx. 30 min ) 
1. Obtain Informed Consent  
2. Obtain Patient demographics  
3. Verify  Inclusion and Exclusion criteria  
4. Schedule for Study visit  
5. Randomize in a 1:1 ratio to receive bilateral treatment initially with either Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_557967]  (approx. 100 min)  
1. Perform slit lamp evaluation to verify no abnormal clinical findings  prior to treatment  
2. Perform either bilateral Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_557968] g visit randomization   
3. Patient fills out 5 Point Likert Scale questionnaire about treatment received  
4. Perform slit lamp evaluation to verify no abnormal clinical findings prior to treatment  
5. Perform the other bilateral Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_557969]  ≥ 1-hour after first  
6. Patient fills out [ADDRESS_732632] one (1) hour apart.  
 
1. Eye makeup shall be removed.  
2. The device shall be prepared for use in accordance with the Instructions per User Manual for 
the device to which the subject is randomized.  
3. Proparacaine  eye drops will be instilled in both eyes.  
4. Therapy will be delivered in accordance with the User Manual for the device to which the 
subject is randomized.  
5. Throughout the treatment visit, subjects will be assessed for any adverse events.  
 
Safety monitoring  
1. Asses s and record any adverse events that are observed or reported by [CONTACT_423]  
2. Assess and record any treatment device deficiency  
 
 
Randomization:  
An envelope with 42 identical slips of paper with 21 labeled Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_557970] 21 labeled iLux will be 
prepared prior  to initiating the study for a 1:[ADDRESS_732633] . 
 
Statistical  Analysi s Plan   
Descriptive statistics will be provi ded to summarize each treatment questionnaire response: N, 
mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median. Categorical or binary endpoints 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_48361].  Other statistical tests of correlation, variance, or 
regression t o be recommended by [CONTACT_557975].  
 
Storage of Data  
All study data will be stored at Phoenix Eye Care in a locked  secure location with restricted  
access.  
 
Data Confidentiality  
Subjects will be assigned Subject numbers, which will only be identifiable by [CONTACT_557976].  
 
Risk / Benefit assessment  
 
Risks  
1- Eyelid irritation , redness,  or inflammation  
2- Ocular irritation , redness,  or inflammation  
3- Ocular symptoms – tearing, itching, redness, temporary visual blur  
 
Prevention of Risks  
All Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_557971]’s representatives.  Both instruments have the curren t firmware available 
as of September 2019.  
 
Adverse events  
After each treatment and the subject ha ving had an opportunity to spontaneously mention any 
problems, the Investigator should inquire about adverse events.  All adverse events will be 
recorded on a separate adverse events form.

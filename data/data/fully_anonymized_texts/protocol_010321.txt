Objectives  
 
Primary Mechanistic Objective:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS 
(continuous theta -burst stimulation -cTBS) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L -
DLPFC) on modulating the neural network that underlies hypnotizability  and hypnosis .  
Relevant Clinical  Objective:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over 
L-DLPFC on enhancing hypnotic analgesia (HA) as measured by [CONTACT_156460].  
 
Secondary Objective A:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC  
on modulating the neural network that underlies hypnotic intensity.  
Secondary Objective B:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on enhancing hypnotizability (as measured by [CONTACT_156461] -HIP and Stroop 
Task) and hypnotic intensity (as measured by [CONTACT_156462] -HIS).  
Secondary Objective C:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on the neural network underlying the conflict regulation system as a surrogate of ef fective 
modulation of the neural circuitry that underl ies hypnotizability.  
Secondary Objective D:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on the neural network that underl ies the post -hypnotic Stroop Effect.  
Secondary Objective E:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on modulating the neural network that underlies hypnotic analgesia (HA).  
 
Design and Outcomes   
 
Study Design:  This study is a double blind , placebo -controlled, mechanistic  trial assessing rTMS 
as a strategy for the modulation of the neural circuitry underlying hypnotizability  and hypnotic 
analgesia in participants with a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS).  
 
Schedule and Type of Evaluations:  There are four visits for t his. The first visit is a screening 
visit where the participant will be consented to be screened for the study. The participant will then 
be screen ed to determine inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the participant meets criteria, the 
participant will be consented for the imaging  and rTMS portions of the study. The participant will 
be assigned their  randomization code and their counterbalanced imaging days. Up to three  
separate imaging visits will be conducted  including  a baseline MRI for TMS target identification 
(Visit #2)  and two separate MRI-TMS sessions consisting of a hypnotic analgesia  and hypnotic 
stroop procedures (Visits #3 -4). Visit #2 and #[ADDRESS_181231] Guidelines and Considerations  10 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 MRI visits which include  thermal pain and stroop MRI  sessions, t he participant  will receive either 
sham or active rTMS (depending on randomization ) in a non -crossover design .  
Study Overview D iagram:  
 
 
All participants will undergo the Hypnotic Stroop  Scan Session  Day. All participants  will receive 
the identical  pre-rTMS scan session. One-half (n=50)  will receive active  rTMS and one -half (n=50)  
will receive sham  rTMS  (two arm, double -blind, sham -controlled) . All participants will receive the 
identical  post-rTMS scan session.  Changes  in resting  state  functional connectivity  between L -
DLPFC and dACC in the active rTMS versus the sham rTMS conditions  will be assessed . This 
primary endpoint is a between -group comparison. We will also measure the difference in brain 
activation  during  the hypno tic induction , and Stroop task  (after post -hypnotic suggestion)  between 
the active and sham rTMS. This will also be a between -groups comparison. Using the Hypnotic 
Induction Profile (HIP)  and Hypnotic Intensity  Scale  (HIS) , we will compare the change in 
hypnotizability  and hypnotic intensity  score between the active and sham rTMS groups.  
 
All participants will undergo the Hypnotic Analgesia Scan Session  Day. All participants will 
complete identical pre - and post - rTMS scan session. One-half will receive active  rTMS  and one -
half will receive sham  rTMS.  Changes in resting state functional connectivity  between L -DLPFC 
and dACC in the active rTMS versus the sham rTMS conditions will be assessed. This primary 
endpoint is a between -group comparison. This scan -session also addresses a secondary aim of 
determining the difference in functional connectivity within the hypnotic analgesia network 
between the active and the sham rTMS groups. This will be  a between -groups comparison. We 
will also compare the activation within the hypnotic analgesia network between the active and 
sham rTMS groups. This will be a between -groups comparison.  We will also utilize a perturbation 
technique to probe the hypnotic induction in an alternative way.  Finally, we will compare the 
difference in pa in thresholds between the active and sham rTMS groups.

Sample Size and Population  
 
The target population is 18-[ADDRESS_181233]  no contraindications to MRI 
or rTMS.  We will enroll 100 pain medication -free (not taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_156403] -depressants  on the 
day of rTMS ) participants and employ a two -arm design with 50 subjects per arm. 
1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Mechanistic and Relevant Clinical Objective s 
 
Primary Mechanistic Objective:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS 
(continuous theta -burst stimulation -cTBS ) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L -
DLPFC) on modulating the neural network that underlies hypnotizability  and hypnosis . In 
other words, the Primary Outcome Measure  is the change in functional connectivity 
between the L -DLPFC  and the dACC in acti ve versus sham rTMS  and the effect of rTMS 
inhibition of activity in the DLPFC on activity in the dACC .  
 
Primary Mechanistic Hypothesis:  Active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will 
modulate the neural network that underlies hypnotizability by [CONTACT_156463] L -DLPFC and dACC as compared to sham rTMS (sham 
cTBS). We hypothesize that active, inhibitory rTMS (continuous theta -burst stimulation) 
will produce increases in functional connectivity between the L -DLPFC and the dACC , 
producing a transient phenotyp e appearing on neuroimaging like a high hypnotizabl e.  
This increase in functional connectivity, coupled with inhibition of activity in the DLPFC, 
would be hypothesized to reduce activity in the dACC as wel l, which is what we have shown to 
be associated with entry into the hypnotic state.  Thus rTMS -induced increase in functional 
connectivity should increase hypnotizability and, coupled with inhibited activity, enhance hypnotic 
intensity as well.  
 
Relevant  Clinical Objective:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over 
L-DLPFC on enhancing the efficacy of hypnotic analgesia (HA)  as measured by [CONTACT_156464].

 1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
Secondary Objective A:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on modulating the neural network that underlies hypnotic intensity.  
 
Secondary Hypothesis A:  Active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will modulate the neural 
network that underlies hypnotic intensity by [CONTACT_156465] L -DLPFC and dACC as 
compared to sham rTMS (sham cTBS) as me asured by [CONTACT_156466] -MRI. 
 
Secondary Objective B:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on enhancing hypnotizability (as measured by [CONTACT_156461] -HIP and Stroop 
Task) and hypnotic intens ity (as measured by [CONTACT_156462] -HIS).  
 
Secondary Hypothesis B:  Active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will increase the HIP 
and HIS scores as well as hypnotic reduction of the Stroop Effect as compared to sham rTMS 
(sham cTBS).  
 
Secondary Objective C:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on the neural network underlying the conflict regulation system as a surrogate of effective 
modulation of the neural circuitry that underlies hypnotizability.  
 
Secondary Hypothesis C:  Active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will modulate the neural 
network that underlies conflict regulation by [CONTACT_156467] (rIFG) and the defaul t mode network (DMN) as compared 
to sham rTMS (sham cTBS).  
 
Secondary Objective D: To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on the neural network that underlies the post-hypnotic Stroop Effect.  
 
Secondary Hypothesis D: Post-hypnotic instruction of word blindness after active, inhibitory 
rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will reduce dACC activity during the Stroop task (similar to high 
hypnotizables) as compared to sham rTMS (sham cTBS).  
 
Secondary Objective E: To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on modulating the neural network that underlies hypnotic analgesia (HA).  
 
Secondary Hypothesis E: Active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will modulate the neural 
network that under lies HA by [CONTACT_133239] a decrease in activity and an increase functional 
connectivity among the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral, insular, and somatosensory cortices 
(hypnotic analgesia network) as compared to sham rTMS (sham cTBS).

 2. BACKGROUND AND RATION ALE 
 
 
2.1 Background on Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS)  
 
 
Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a poorly understood disor der characterized clinically as  
widespread pain lasting three months or more which is not explainable by [CONTACT_156468]/disorder (1). Traditional treatments have limited benefit (2), and long -term use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_156404] (2) due to demonstrated reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_156405]  (3). Hypnotherapy as an intervention has been demonstrated to be quite 
successful in the treatment of FMS  (4). It appears that the type of suggestion utilized is of primary 
importance to the efficacy of the hypnotherapy intervention  for FMS  (5). Hypnotic analgesia for 
FMS has been demonstrated to have effects on the orbitofrontal, cingulate cortices,  and thalamus  
(6, 7) . There have been numerous studies looking at rTMS for the modulation  of pain syndromes  
(8, 9)  as well as for the assessment of anti -nociception properties of rTMS through experimentally 
induced  pain in  normal healthy controls  (10). L-DLPFC rTMS both have demonstrated efficacy in 
modulating the pain experienced in  fibromyalgia  (8, 11) .  
 
 
2.2 Study Rationale  
 
 
Neural Circuitry Underlying Regulation of Cognition:  Theories of cognitive regulation suggest 
that there is a central neural network with two necessary components, which regulate cognition 
and control conflict in the human brain. The first component is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC), which initi ates and implements a cascade of control  (12). The second, the dorsal 
anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), monitors performance and signals w hen adjustments in control 
are needed (12, 13) . The DLPFC and dACC predictably interact together during conflict tasks such 
as the Stroop task (13) and the flanker task (14). 
 
 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: A Technique for Probing and Manipulating Neural 
Networks:  Tools that selectively manipulate cognitive brain circuitry can effectively drive cognitive 
processes  (15). Trans cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) noninvasively activates neuronal 
elements. In TMS,  high-intensity magnetic field is produced by [CONTACT_15728] a brief electric current 
through a magnetic coil. The scalp and skull are crossed unimpeded, and a transient electric  field 
is induced in underlying excitable neuronal tissue. Repetitive TMS produces periods of lasting 
activation or inhibition that persist after stimulation  (16). In particular, inhibition generally results 
from stimulation at or below [ADDRESS_181234] Stimulation:  In 2005, a new rTMS approach, termed theta -burst stimulation  (TBS) , 
was developed  (17). This TBS approach was modeled from earlier work in animal models of 
hippocampal slice  physiology and LTP induction (18, 19) . This approach is not only more efficient 
than traditional rTMS (20), but also much safer  (21-24) and the after-effects  of TBS  have a much 
longer  duration  of effects then traditional rTMS (25). This is important because the currently 
utilize d traditional rTMS  approaches have very limited duration of effect in comparison (20, 26) . 
While single applications of theta -burst have greater  duration of effect  than traditional rTMS, these 
single stimulations  have a limited duration of effect  in comparison to multiple, spaced stimulation 
sessions (20, 27) . In order to produce a prolonged after-effect of stimulation  that is  capable of 
maintaining the after -effect s for the entire duration of the planned  scanner session s, the 
application of two theta -burst stimulation s with spacing of 10 -20 min is necessary (27-30).  
 
 
The Neural Circuitry of Hypnotizability and Manipulated by [CONTACT_156469]:  
Hypnotizability is a measurable behavioral phenotype capable of reflecting differences in 
functional connectivity between the L-DLPFC and the dACC (31, 32) , the two central brain regions 
that process conflict (13, 14) . Consistent with this is the functional neuro imaging finding of  
reduced dACC activity upon entering the hypnotic state  (33, 34) . On functional neuroimaging, it 
has been observed that there is increased connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex (L-DLPFC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC ) in high hypnotizab les compared 
with lows during rest (31). During conflict tasks, specific post -hypnotic instruction -induced changes 
in response latency correlate with changes on functional imaging in the dACC (32, 35, 36) . There 
is also  evidence of less dACC activity among highs than lows during a flanker task  (32). During 
hypnosis and only among high hypnotizables there is reduced activity in the dorsal anterior 
cingulate cortex increased functional connectivity between the L-DLPFC  (a node in the Central 
Executive  Network -CEN ) and the insular cortex ( a node in the Salience Network -SN), and 
reduced connectivity between the L-DLPFC  (CEN ), medial frontal and posterior cingulate cortices 
(a node in the default mode network -DMN)   (33, 34) . 
 
Hypnotic Analgesia Neural Network:  Hypnotic analgesia (HA) involves a neural network 
including the prefrontal cortex ( L-DLPFC), the anterior cingulate cortex  (ACC) , the insular cortex, 
and the somatosensory cortex (37). A proposed mechanism for hypnotic analgesia involves 
activity  that links L-DLPFC with dACC and insula,  thereby  [CONTACT_156470] S2 and dorsal 
posterior insula. Other studies have indicated involvement of dACC  and the insular cortex (IC) in 
hypnotic analgesia (7, 37 -40). These an d other brain regions have been identified in mixed effects 
analysis of pain -reducing properties of leading analgesic drugs during pain versus placebo 
stimulation as measured by [CONTACT_156471] (41, 42) . Other  brain regions are involved 
in hypnotic analgesia including the sensory cortex (S1) (38, 39, 43) , and periaqueductal grey  (39). 
 
 
 
Hypnotic Analgesia Tool for the Modulation  of Pain : Hypnotic analgesia utilizes targeted 
verbal instruction to affect a specific , targeted  neural network(s) involved in the pain perception 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  16 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 system within the human brain (38, 44) . The specific hypnotic instruction modulates  the neural 
network  involved with that instruction . The degree of pain experienced under the hypnotic 
suggestion of induced pain is positively correlated with L-DLPFC, dACC, and insular activity (45). 
Hypnotic analgesia reduce s activity in the dACC (44).  
 
The Neural Circuitry Modulated by [CONTACT_156472]:  Like hypnosis, rTMS delivered over the L-
DLPFC is correlated with a reciproca l interaction of the L-DLPFC with the ACC. This reciprocal 
interaction is seen in normal healthy controls performing conflict tasks (15) as wel l as in individuals 
with depression (46). Over L-DLPFC, rTMS  has been demonstrated to exert frequency dependent 
changes  where  inhibitory rTMS modulates  the network in one direction and excitatory rTMS 
modulates the network  in the opposite direction (47). This infers that changes in the  targeted  
network occur predictably depending on the frequency selected (47). 
 
Hypnosis and rTMS as Tools for Modulating  Brain Activity and Connectivity:  Manipulations 
of brain circuitry can be measured through imaging techniques (47-49). BOLD fMRI is a technique 
that measures changes in blood flow are accompanied by [CONTACT_156473] (50). Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) is a neuroimaging technique that measures 
conne ctivity between functionally connected brain regions (51). This technique captures both the 
brain processes at work in a variety of cognitive states (52) as well as the manipulation of these 
networks through targeted perturbations such as with rTMS (47) or hypnosis (31, 48) . rTMS 
modulation  of brain activity has behavioral outcomes that are correlated with change in functional 
connectivity (46). fcMRI and rTMS can be combined to image the resulting rTMS brain connectivity 
manipulations (53). One could consider rTMS as a tool for driving functional connectivity in a given 
direction for a predictable period of time. fcMRI has not only been demonstrated to underlie the 
propensity to experience hypnosis (31), but additionally to measure the effects of hypnosis as 
compared to the baseline scan (48). Therefore, fcMRI can measure  the effect of rTMS -augmented 
hypnotherapy, as it has been demonstrated to have the sensitivity to capture the effects of each 
of these interventions in isolation (31, 48) . 
 
Change in Functional Connectivity and Activity Modulated by [CONTACT_112016] (Primary Outcome 
Measure):   rTMS  has been demonstrated to reliably change functional connectivity in a frequency 
dependent manner (54). There are numerous studies demonstrating rTMS -modulated increases 
in functional connect ivity(46, 47, 53 -58), suggesting that the rTMS modulation of L -DLPFC rTMS 
will cause a predictable increase in functional connectivity to the dACC (47). 
Hypnosis/hypnotizability will be increased with rTMS as has been demonstrated previously (26, 
59) which we believe will have a beneficial effect on the treatment outcome as has been previously 
demonstrated on attention measures (60, 61)  and clinical populations (62).   This increase in 
functional connectivity, coupled with inhibition of activity in the L-DLPFC, would be 
hypothesized to reduce activity in the dACC as well, which is what we have shown to be 
associated with entry into the hypnotic state. Thus rTMS induced increase in functio nal 
connectivity should increase hypnotizability and, coupled with inhibited activity, enhance hypnotic 
intensity as well.  
Neural Networks Affected By [CONTACT_156474] : In 
addition to abnormalities in pain processing, there is aberrant processing of non -painful 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  17 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 somatosensory information in FMS, especially when somatic signals arise from the body within 
an aversive stimulus context (63). At the neural network le vel, FMS can be understood as a 
disorder involving a reduction in descending control, including suppression of descending 
inhibitory pathways and/or enhancement of descending facilitative pathways (64). Central 
mechanisms of pain processing in the fr ontal cortex and cingulate cortex appear to play an 
important role in pain pathophysiology in FMS (65). Hypnotic analgesi a specifically for FMS has 
been demonstrated to have increased cerebral blood -flow in bilateral orbitofrontal and subcallosal 
cingulate cortices, the right thalamus, and the left inferior parietal cortex, and decreased bilaterally 
in the cingulate cortex (6).  
 
The Effects of DLPFC rTMS for Pain and the Neural Network Involved in FMS:  There have 
been numerous studies looking at rTMS for the modulation  of pain syndromes (8, 9)  as well as for 
the assessment of anti -nociception properties of rTMS through experimentally induced  pain in 
healthy controls (10). L-DLPFC rTMS has demonstrated efficacy in treating fibromyalgia (66). 
When compared to sham, active  L-DLPFC rTMS reduces hot pain and hot allodynia (8). This 
analgesia has been associated with elevated blood oxygenation -level dependent (BOLD) signal 
in the L-DLPFC and diminished BOLD signal in the anterior cingulate, thalamus, midbrain, and 
medulla. Pretreatment with naloxone, a mu -opi[INVESTIGATOR_9727], abolishes the analgesic effects of 
real rTMS. In addition, naloxone reduces the rTMS -induced attenuation of BOL D signal response 
to painful stimuli throughout pain processing regions (67) (68). 
 
Functional Brain Basis of Differences in Hypnotizability:  fMRI has been utilized to examine 
the role of three major resting state networks – the central executive ( CEN), salience (SN) and 
default mode (DMN) networks - in the trait ability to experience hypnosis and the hypnotic 
state (33, 34, 69) . There are  identified differences in fMRI functional connectivity between 
individuals who are high and low in hypnotizability involving increased connectivity of the left 
anterior aspects of the DLPFC and the dACC in high hy pnotizables compared with lows during 
rest (49). The degree of pain experienced during hypnotic suggestion is positively correlated with 
L-DLPFC, dACC, and ins ular activation (45). Conversely, hypnotic analgesia specifically directed 
at pain affect ( ‘the pain will not bother you ’) associated with reduced activity in the dACC (44). 
These findings also suggest that dACC dea ctivation during hypnosis is task dependent, with 
decrements in activation related to decreased salience of negative affect. Hypnotizability has 
been correlated with performance on conflict tasks (70) along with neural strategies of response 
to those tasks (32). 
 
Brain Activity and Functional Connectivity Associated with the Hypnotic State:  During 
hypnosis  and only in among high hypnotizables , there is reduced activity in the dorsal anterior 
cingulate cortex  as well as increased functional connectivity between the L-DLPFC  (CEN ) and 
the insular cortex (SN), and reduced connectivity between the L-DLPFC  (CEN ) and medial frontal 
and posterior cingulate cortices (DMN). These changes in neural activity underlie the focused 
attention and enhanced somatic control  that characterizes hypnosis.  
Clinical Efficacy of Hy pnotic Analgesia:   In a randomized trial among [ADDRESS_181235] Guidelines and Considerations  18 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 of hypnosis u tilized  less medication, reported less pain and anxiety, experienced fewer procedural 
complications, and were able to complete their procedures in an average of 17 minutes less time  
(71-73). Hypnosis made their experience less unc omfortable, less anxiety provoking , and shorter. 
A similar randomized clinical trial  has been conducted  to evaluate whether hypnotic relaxation, 
when compared to routine care, could decrease children’s distress and the ease and duration of 
performing a voi ding cystourethrogram (VCUG) (74). In that study, forty -four children scheduled 
for an upcoming VCUG were randomized to receive hypnosis ( n = 21) or routine care ( n = 23) 
while undergoing the procedure. In 4 of 5 outcomes (parent repo rt, observational rating of the 
child, medical staff rating of the procedure, and total procedure time), effect sizes were moderate 
to large (.56 -.86). Hypnosis is effective in reducing chronic cancer pain (75, 76) .  A combination 
of weekly group psychotherapy and training in self -hypnosis reduced pain by 50% with the same 
low amount of analgesic medication among 86 women  (75).  
 
Role of Endogenous Opi[INVESTIGATOR_156406]:  The mechanism of  
hypnotic analgesia  has been demonstrated to be independent  from the endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_156407]. In this study, all [ADDRESS_181236] determined to be able to achieve hypnotic pain 
reduction . Then  in double blind fashion , these participants were  injected with either saline or 10 
milligrams  of naloxone. There was no difference in the extent of analgesia between the conditions, 
demon strating  that blockage of endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_156408] (77). Conversely, excitatory L-DLPFC rTMS exerts its anti -nociceptio n effects through 
endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_156409] . Administration of naloxone pretreatment has been 
demonstrated to abolish the efficacy of rTMS anti -nociception  (67). Neuroimaging has been 
utilized to confirm that the administration of  naloxone does in fact block the neural elements 
involved in the anti -nociception properties of active, excitatory L -DLPFC rTMS  (68). 
 
Modulation of Pain in Fibromyalgia with rTMS at dACC and DLPFC : Several groups have  
investigated the analgesic effect rTMS  in FMS related pain (11). In a recent study, s ixteen FMS 
patients received 20 rTMS sessions over a 4 -week period. The primary outcome measure was 
the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) item 5 rating (“average pain rating in the last 24 hours” expressed 
on a 11 -point numeric rating scale with “0” being “no pain” and “10” being “worst pain imaginable”) 
measured [ADDRESS_181237] modulation  session. It was demonstrated that there  was up to an 
84% decrease in pain ratings (average decrease 31%) after active TMS when stimulating at 10 
Hz compared to a control group which was stimulated with 1 Hz. L-DLPFC rTMS can be utilized 
in the modulation  of fibromyalgia (78) with improvements in measures of pain (66). In th ese 
studies, the stimulation parameters were 10 Hz with a pulse train duration (on time) 5 s econds, 
power  (intensity) level 120% of resting motor threshold, and an inter -train interval (off time) 10 
seconds (15 second cycle time). The primary outcome measure for this study was also the Brief 
Pain Inventory (BPI) item 5 rating. Excitatory L -DLPFC rTMS was shown to demonstrate a mean 
29% (statistically significant) reduction in pain symptoms in comparison to the FMS patient’s 
baseline pain. Sham rTMS participants had a 4% non -significant change in daily pain from their 
baseline pain (66).  Inhibitory rTMS over the dACC was demonstrated to not exert a clinically 
meaningful effect on pain, suggesting that outside of hypnosis, inhibitory rTMS alone  should not 
exert an independent effect on pain (11). 
Intervention Regimen:  We will employ a spaced continuous theta -burst technique that is capable 
of provid ing a change in neural activity, which  will last for the entirety of each of the participant’s  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_181238]-rTMS scann er session s(27-30, 79) .  
 
Name [CONTACT_156540]:  This study will u tilize two applications of [ADDRESS_181239] stimulation at 80% of the resting motor threshold as this has been demonstrated effective 
in producing a prolonged  change in cortical excitability (30) as well as  safe(17). The %rMT will be 
adjust based off of sk ull to cortex distance as previously reported.  The spaced application of theta -
burst stimulation (TBS)  was chosen as the stimulation strategy  because this study will require 
more than an hour of change in the targeted neural network node of interest  and th e spaced 
approach has been demonstrated to have a much longer duration of effect than a single 800 pulse  
cTBS stimulation session (27, 28, 30, 79) . The fifteen minute spacing is essential as it has been 
demonstrated that prolonged stimulation approaches without spacing in between can cause a 
reversal of intended effect (80). The spacing has been utilized in animal models of LTP /LTD  
induction (19). 
 
Route:  The spaced TBS approach will be applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L -
DLPFC) in the region of the L -DLPFC that has the highest functional connectivity with the dorsal 
anterior cingulate (dACC). This  sub-region of the L -DLPFC  will be identified  by [CONTACT_156475] -edge rTMS targeting  
methodology (81).  
 
Dosage:  80% of the resting motor threshold  adjusted to target depth will be utilized as the dose 
of cTBS  because  this dose has been demonstrated effective in modulating the  desired cortical  
target across several studies  (27, 30) . [ADDRESS_181240] with 30 Hz  bursts at 
6 Hz  will be utilized as this  is the optimal approach for producing inhibition (82). This study 
approach will utilize  two stimulation trains of [ADDRESS_181241] as has been previously described (27, 30) . This  stimulation 
approach  will be applied in between the pre - and post - rTMS  scanner sessions for both scanner 
session days (total of two stimulation sessions for each participant).  
 
Known and Potential Risks:  There is no known risk of seizure with the currently stated 
parameters (17, 24) . In order to have a seizure from rTMS or theta -burst stimulation, one must 
receive stimulation that is at or greater than 100% of the participant’s motor threshold  (24). The 
motor threshold is reflective of stimulation output necessary to cause a neuronal depola rization  
(83). Without neuronal depolarization, seizure from rTMS has not be en demonstrated to occur. 
The traditional rTMS parameters have resulted in seizure because these require 120% of the 
motor threshold  (84). Theta -burst stimulation has been demonstrated to mod ulate the brain with 
less than 100% motor threshold  (17). Only one case of theta -burst stimulation has resulted in 
seizure and this case was related to using 100% resting motor threshold  (24, 85) . Theta -burst 
stimulation has been utilized safely in children with no incidence of seizure  (21, 22)  and has been 
suggested to be similar risk  to single and paired pulse TMS  (21), which has been rat ed as minimal 
risk for children  (23). 
3. STUDY DESIGN  
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  20 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 This study is a double -blind, placebo -controlled , mechanistic trial  assessing active rTMS as a 
strategy for the modulation of the neural circuitry underlying  hypnotizability  and hypnotic analgesia  
in participants with FMS  (31). We will utilize the  gold standard for blinded rTMS studies which 
utilizes a double -sided active/ sham rTMS coil that allows for double blinding of the treater and the 
participant  (Magventure Cool-B65 A/P Butterfly Coil )(86). All 100 participants will be randomized 
to one of the two stimulation arms  (sham or active rTMS)  and will go through both of the  hypnotic 
stroop  and hypnotic analgesia scan -sessio n days . The only difference between these two groups 
is the application of active versus sham rTMS. Otherwise, all hypnosis interventions and MRI 
scans include the same structural and functional acquisitions .  
 
Figure 2 : This is a double blind , sham -controlled, counterbalanced, mechanistic trial. There will 
be 100 participants with a confirmed diagnosis of FMS  recruited, enrolled , and randomize d to one 
of the two arms (active or sham rTMS ). The scan sessions will be counterbalanced to control for 
order effects.  
 
Primary Mechanistic Objective:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (continuous 
theta -burst stimulation -cTBS) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L -DLPFC) on m odulating the 
neural network that underlies hypnotizability  and hypnosis . In other words, t he Primary 
Mechanistic Outcome Measure  is the change in functional connectivity between the L -DLPFC 
and the dACC in active versus sham rTMS  (cTBS) , and the associate d effect of inhibition of 
activity in the L -DLPFC on activity in the dACC .  
 
Primary Mechanistic Hypothesis:  Active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will modulate 
the neural network that underlies hypnotizability  by [CONTACT_156476] L -DLPFC and dACC as compared to sham rTMS (sham cTBS).  We 
hypothesize that active, inhibitory rTMS (continuous theta -burst stimulation) will produce 
increases in functional connectivity bet ween the L -DLPFC and the dACC (47), producing a 
transient neural phenotype (30) which appear s on neuroimaging like a high hypnotizable (31).  
This increase in functional connec tivity, coupled with inhibition of activity in the L-DLPFC, 
would be hypothesized to reduce activity in the dACC as well, which is what we have shown to 
be associated with entry into the hypnotic state.  Thus rTMS induced increase in functional

network that underlies hypnotic intensity by [CONTACT_156477] , increased 
functional connectivity between the L-DLPFC (CEN ) and the insula (SN), and reduced 
connectivity between the L-DLPFC (CEN)  and the posterior cingulate cortex (DMN)  as compared

on the neural network underlying the conflict regulation system as a reflection of effective 
modulation of the neural circuitry underlying hypnotizability.

  14 MAR 2018  
 1. Central Laboratory -The Center on Stress and Health:  The center  provides the  office space 
and infrastructure for  the personnel and effort necessary for this trial . The Department of 
Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences has seminar and conference room space that w ill be utilized 
for the grant -related meetings, training, and consultations.  The lab has desktop computers 
equipped with cloud backup and security access control. A laptop computer and a portable LCD 
projector will be made  available for presentations and training purposes. The computers are also 
equipped with licensed software packages inc luding SPSS, Antivirus, and Microsoft Office . 
2. The Stanford Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging : The Stanford Center for 
Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging (CNI) has been designed to reflect experimental needs in 
the social sciences disciplines. The core instrumentation provided by [CONTACT_156480] a research -
dedicated 3T MRI scanner, a GE Discovery MR750 that will be used with a Nova Medical 32 -
channel head coil. Improvements in fMRI technology are implemented from time to time at major 
academic research environments. Fidelity to sequences used at the beginning of the study will be 
maintained to ensure that changes in signal -to-noise ratio (SNR) do not take place d uring the 
course of the study.  
 
Duration of Enrollment Period and Follow -up: Given that this is a mechanistic trial, there is no 
follow -up period beyond the two scan sessions. The period of enrollment will be dependent upon 
the availability of the partici pant and the facility scheduling availability to complete the screening 
visits and the scan sessions . The entire trial is estimated to take approximately 3 years of data 
collection with an additional year of analysis.  
 
TMS  System : The Magventure MagPro Sy stem  is a computerized electromechanical instrument 
that produces and delivers brief duration, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_68236] (pulsed) magnetic fields to induce 
electrical currents in localized regions of the cerebral cortex. The Magventure MagPro System  
has been FDA -cleared for use in adult subjects. There is a clinical research option for the 
Magventure MagPro System  that provides features necessary to conduct randomized sham -
controlled trials and other TMS research.  
 
The Magventure MagPro System  consists of the following equipment and software:  
 
 System Software  
 TMS Data Management System software  
 Stimulation Coils included is a coil with two sides:  
o A blinded sham side ( acoustically matched to pro tect the integrity of the blind)  
o A blinded active side. 
 
TMS Administration:  The TMS stimulator (MagPro, Medtronic Functional Diag nostics, 
Skovlunde, Denmark) will be  used to generate repetitive biphasic magnetic pulses. Both 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  24 of 99 Version 1. 3

 stimulation groups  (active and sham rTMS ) will receive simulation from a specially designed coil, 
the Cool -B65 AP Butterfly coil (Magventure Magpro; Farum, Denmark) , which is capable of 
delivering stimulation is a double -blind fashion . A manual of rTMS administration procedures is 
included with t his protocol and is titled Appendix 2 and 3.  
 
Motor Threshold (MT) Elicitation:  Given that accurate elicitation of the motor threshold is cr ucial 
in establishing a safe and accurate dose of TBS stimulation, the MT will be elicited by [CONTACT_156481]. Each operator will stimulat e the hand representation within the left motor cortex 
with single pulses to determine the individual motor threshold by [CONTACT_156482]’s relaxed abductor pollicis brevis (APB) . We will utilize the PEST procedure for this 
part of the MT assessment  (90). The lower of the two elicited MT numbers will be chosen as the 
MT for that participant. The first MT elicitation will be performed prior to the pre -TMS  scan session 
and the second will be performed after the pre -TMS scan session and before the rTMS (cTBS) 
application. There will be a separate TMS operator for each of these elicitations. We will utilize an 
electromyography (EMG) instrument for the first M T elicitation and visual inspection for the 
second elicitation. These methods have been demonstrated to be very closely correlated with  
each other  (91). The MT will be elic ited using the same coil (C -B60 But terfly Coil) for both 
measurements. Th e C-B60 coil is designed with the exact same windings as the TBS stimulation 
coil (Cool B70 A/P Butterfly coil).  
 
Continuous TBS Session:  The continuous TBS will be applied using the Cool -B65 A/P coil  which 
has a built in sham system. The Cool -B65 A/P coil is capable of delivering either active or sham 
rTMS in a manner  that is randomized by [CONTACT_156483]. The 
sham setting on this coil looks and sounds similar to the active s etting, but has a hidden aluminum 
plate blocking actual stimulation. The Magventure device holds a blinded key code that is kept by 
[CONTACT_156484] . The operator is instructed to flip the coil to correspond with the key code, but 
does not know the  stimul ation group  (active versus sham) . 
 
Stimulation Dose:  This study utilizes  two applications of 800 pulses of continuous TBS at 80% of 
the resting motor threshold as this has been demonstrated effective in producing a prolonged 
change in cortical excitability  (30) as well as being d emonstrated as  safe(17). We will adjust the 
dose based off of the difference between motor cortex to skull and prefrontal cortex to skull 
measurements as has been previously reported (92). The spaced application of theta -burst 
stimulation (TBS)  approach was chosen  because this study will re quire more than an hour of  
modulation of the target in order to complete the scan sessions.  The spaced approach has been 
demonstrated to have a much longer duration of effect than a single 800-pulse  cTBS stimulation 
session (27, 28, 30, 79) . The fifteen minute spacing  between the two 800-pulse cTBS applications  
is essential because it has been demonstrated that prolonged stimulation approaches without 
spacing in between can cause a reversal of intended effect (80). 
 
Stimulation Site:  The spaced  cTBS approach utilized for this study will be applied to the left 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L -DLPFC) in the sub-region that has the highest functional 
connectivity with the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC ). This will be done through the use of 
neuronavigation hardware coupled with the latest in cutting edge targeting (81). This study will  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_181243] connectivity with the dACC. It 
has been demonstrated previously that such an approach can be applied  within the L -DLPFC (58). 
Once the pre -TMS scan session is complete, the images will be exported to the Localite 
Neuronavigation System  (93) so that while the participant is undergoing their motor threshold 
(MT) elicitation and the neuronavigation targeting is o ccurring such that the participant’s target 
and dose will be completed in time for the rTMS (c TBS) session.  
 
Stimulation Parameters:  80% of the resting motor threshold  (rMT)  was chosen as the dose of 
cTBS as this dose has been demonstrated  to be optimal in suppressing the MEP . We will adjust 
the skull -prefrontal cortex distance to account for any differences in differential volume loss.  We 
will u tilize [ADDRESS_181244]  (cTBS)  with 30 Hz  bursts at 6Hz as this has been 
demonstrated to be optimal in suppressing the MEP (82). We will apply two stimulation trains of 
800 pulses with a 15 -minute space in between each train of cTBS  as has been previously 
described (27, 30) . This  stimulation session  will be performed in betw een the pre - and post - TMS 
scanner sessions for both scanner session days (total of two stimulation sessions for each 
participant). The participant will receive cTBS stimulation in the manner described in the manual 
that is attached to the appendix of this  protocol . The handle of the coil will be pointed backwards 
(45° angle to the sagittal line) and will be fixated in an arm . In order to preserve the blind, the 
participant will be randomized to the same rTMS  (cTBS)  condition for both scanner days (86). 
 
Hypnosis Intervention:  Hypnosi s will be induced while the subject is in the scanner though the 
use of headphones and a pre -recorded induction script. Hypnotic instructions will be standardized, 
and will involve a simple induction instruction that has been used in prior research on the brain 
signature [CONTACT_156541] (48) as well as  in clinical care (94). The instruction includes being 
asked to:  “Look up and close your eyes, take a deep breath, let the breath out, let your eyes 
relax, and let your body float, as though you were in a bath, a lake, a hot tub, or floating in space. 
With your eyes closed and remaining in this state of concentration, e njoy this state of floating 
relaxation and allow yourself to feel it more and more intensely.” The ability to enter and maintain 
the hypnotic state through such an induction mechanism in the fMRI environment has been 
previously demonstrated in by [CONTACT_156485], w ho compared induction using these means in the MRI 
environment with hypnotic induction “off -line” (95). An extended description of the hypnosis 
protocol is attached i n Appendix 4 (describing hypnotic induction, Hypnotic Induction Profile (HIP), 
and hypnotic analgesia script).  
 
Randomization and Blinding:  Both active and sham rTMS  groups  will receive simulation from 
a specially designed coil  called  the Cool -B65 AP Butterfly coil (Magventure Magpro; Farum, 
Denmark). This coil is capable of delivering either active or sham rTMS  (cTBS)  in a manner that 
is randomized by [CONTACT_156486]. The sham setting on this 
coil looks and sounds similar to the active setting, but has a hidden aluminum plate blocking actual 
stimulation. The Magventure  TMS  device holds a blinded key code that is kept by [CONTACT_156487]. During the rTMS setup, t he operator is instructed to flip the coil to correspond 
with the key code, but is unclear as to the active  versus sham  stimulation  group.

 Centralization:  Evaluations will be centralized in the Center on Stress and Health , which is 
directed by [CONTACT_156488][INVESTIGATOR_16614], MD . The Center on Stress and Health has sufficient office space and 
infrastructure with in the  Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences  to house the study

 5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
 
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration   
 
The transcranial magnetic stimula tion ( TMS ) device (MagPro, Medtronic Functional Diag nostics, 
Skovlunde, Denmark) utilized  is a computerized electromechanical instrument that produces and 
delivers brief duration, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_68236] (pulsed) magnetic fields to induce electrical currents in 
localized regions of the cerebral cortex. Since the TMS device  produces a time varying magnetic 
field, its intended effect derives fundamentally from Faraday’s Law, which asserts that a time -
varying magnetic field produces an electrical current in an adjacent conductive substance. During 
TMS  application , the conductive substance of interest is the brain, in particular the region of the 
cortex that lies beneath the stimulation  coil. 
 
The electric current induced in th e targeted  region of the cortex travels in a path orthogonal to the 
direction of the alternating magnetic field with the point of maximum field strength and greatest 
current located directly beneath the center of the coil, which is the component that rests against 
the patient’s head and transmits magnetic pulses to the patient’s brain. The induced current is 
tangential to the scalp at the cortical surface, and diminishes in magnitude with increasing depth.  
In the area of the motor cortex  targeted for motor threshold acquisition , where field strength 
achieves the stimulation threshold, it is postulated that neuronal depolarization occurs. The peak 
magnetic field strength achieved with each pulse is approximately 0.[ADDRESS_181249] neuronal modulation . It is thought that these 
actions may cause various physiologic changes in the brain . TMS  is a technique capable of 
modulating targeted cognitive processes  (108, 109) . TMS has previously been demonstrated to 
enhance hypnotizability  (26). Traditional rTMS has limited duration of  after-effect s (26, 110) . A 
new stimulation approach termed  continuous  theta -burst stimulation  (17) has been demonstrated 
to have  an extended duration of after-effects, particularly if administered  in a patterned, spaced 
paradigm (27-30, 79) .  
 
Admin istration:  The TMS stimulator (MagPro, Medtronic Functional Diag nostics, Skovlunde, 
Denmark) will be  used to generate repetitive biphasic magnetic pulses. Magnetic pulses w ill be 
delivered with a figure -eight -coil (Cool -B65 A/PCoil).  The L-DLPFC  will be localized according to 
previously described procedures  where combined fu nctional and structural imagin g is utilized  to 
find the area of greatest connectivity with dACC  (81). The participant will receive stimulation over  
the left motor cortex with single pulses in order to determine th at individual ’s motor threshold 
through measurement of the  corresponding muscle twitching of the subject’s relaxed abductor 
pollicis brevis  as measured by [CONTACT_42623] (EMG)  once and visual inspection once  (91). 
The PEST procedure  will be utilized  during the  MT acquisition portions of the study (90). Once 
the MT has been determined , the coil will be moved to the neuronavigated L -DLPFC  target (81). 
The handle of the coil will be pointed backwards (45° angle to the sagittal line)  and will be fixed 
to the stimulation arm  (30).  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  32 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 Dosing Schedule:  A spaced theta -burst technique  will be employed  that will modulate the neural 
network node  in targeted neural network  for the entirety of the scanning session  (27-30, 79) . Theta 
burst TMS will be applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  (L-DLPFC) . Two applications 
of [ADDRESS_181250] stimulation at 80% of the resting motor threshold  will be 
utilized  as this has been demonstrated effective in producing several hours of change in cortical 
excitability  (30) and safe  (17). The decision to choose a 15 -minute  interval is based on the results 
of the several human experiments using this spaced approach (29, 30)  and on long-term 
depression  (LTD) protocols used in animals, where it has been demonstrated  that cTBS trains 
spaced  in the order of 10 -15 minute  intervals generate more persistent LT D (111) . 
 
Potential Adverse Events:  Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation  (rTMS)  is generally 
regarded as safe and without any serious or lasting adverse effects  (99, 112) . A newer form of 
rTMS, termed continuous theta -burst stimulation  (cTBS) , is an even safer intervention  and is  
suggested to be  minimal risk in children  (21-23). Inadvertent induction of a seizure is the most 
medically significant , potential safety concern . Seizure  has only been observed once with cTBS 
and only in exceedingly high stimulation settings  (24, 85) . Furthermore, w ith the adoption and 
widespread use of recommendations delineating a safe margin for TMS dosing parameters as 
disseminated in t he 1998 TMS consensus safety guideline from the National Institute of 
Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the risk for seizures during rTMS  in general  is 
significantly mitigated. This study will comply with NINDS guideline standards for transcranial  
magnetic stimulation (TMS)  (99, 112) . It is important to note that there is no evidence in the 
literature to indicate that a single seizure during TMS makes subsequent seizures more likely in 
an otherwise non -seizure -prone individual. There are potential consequ ences of a seizure, 
regarding employment or insurability in the future. If a subject does experience a seizure related 
to this investigation, a letter from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_156414], and there is no reason  to expect  another seizure in the future.   
 
There is no known risk of seizure with the currently stated parameters  (17, 24) . In order to have 
a seizure from inhibitory rTMS (cTBS), one must receive stimulation that is at or greater than 
100% of the participant’s motor threshold  (MT) (24). The MT is reflective of stimulation output 
necessary to cause a neuronal depolarization  (83). Without neuronal depolarization, seizure from 
rTMS has not been demons trated to occur. The traditional rTMS parameters have resulted in 
seizure because these require 120% of the MT (84). cTBS has been demonstrated to modulate 
the brain with less than 100% motor  threshold  (17). Only one case  of cTBS has resulted in seizure 
and this case was related to using 100% MT (24, 85) . cTBS has been utilized safely in children 
with no incidence of seizure  (21, 22)  and has been suggested to be similar risk  to single and 
paired pulse TMS  (21), which has been rat ed as minimal risk for children  (23). Inhibitory rTMS 
(cTBS) will be administered in the Stanford Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging  and 
outside the scanner . Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_156415]. Because of the fixed nature of the 
stimulation dose, there will be no modification to the stimulation parameters. The dose of inhibitory 
rTMS (c TBS) is personalized for each participant through the use of resting motor threshold 
acquisition  (90). 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  33 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 Hearing Risk:  There is the potential risk of alteration in auditory threshold  secondary to expo sure 
to rTMS . As a result of the rapid changes in the magnetic field during rTMS  administration, the 
coil produces an audible, high -energy clicking sound, which may be associated with temporary 
increases in auditory threshold. During previous studies with the rTMS approaches , all subjects 
were required to use hearing protection at a p rotection rating of ≥30 db. No change in hearing 
was found with air conduction threshold testing in the two randomized clinical studies when this 
method of ear protection was used. All participants will be asked to use earplugs  for this study.  
 
Other side effects of TMS:  Prophylactic use of acetaminophen or ibuprofen will be allowed for 
subjects reporting sensations at or near the stimulation site , which are uncomfortable or painful. 
Participants reporting headaches during or following study stimulation ses sion will be encouraged 
to take acetaminophen or ibuprofen prior to the stimulation session . All subjects will be monitored, 
and appropriate treatment will be recommended including the possibility of discontinuing the next 
scanner day . Any other potential side effects will be managed symptomatically with treatment(s) 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_156493]. All symptomatic interventions will be 
recorded in the subject’s case file and, if applicable, adverse event CRF.

Zaleplon, zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], or zopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123] (1 dose) as needed for significant  insomnia  during the night prior 
to the scanner sessions  or lorazepam (up to 2 mg) for significant anxiety during the day and night 
prior to the scanner sessions. These medic ations  may be administered up to  the night prior to the 
stimulation session (until 8:00 PM ), but not during the morning of the sessions  or at any time 
during the scanning day  (100) . The use of alternative hypnotics or anxiolytic compounds requires 
prior approval from the PIs. Hormonal contraceptives are allowed if the subject has been on a 
stable dose  for at least [ADDRESS_181253] from the study.  
 
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
 
Because this is a mechanistic trial involving a screening visit and three mandatory scanner visits, 
adherence will be determined by [CONTACT_156494]/her scanner 
sessions.  We will make every effort that every participant completes this protocol and given the 
limited time commitment, it is likely we will have good study adherence.

6.2.1  Screening Evaluation  
 
Consenting Procedure  
 
Consenting Processes : There will be  three consent processes: one online screening process 
for absolute contraindications,  one consent process  for in-person screening , and the other for 
study procedures.  For the first in-person consent process, the clinical research coordinator  (CRC)  
will screen the participant ’s eligibility for participation in the study . [CONTACT_156544][INVESTIGATOR_156416]. Nolan 
Williams will consent the participa nts for the second in-person phase of the consenting process , 
which involves discussing the risk of the rTMS procedure and MRI scanning.  The participant will 
be consented in the sequence that has been defined b y the NCCIH.  
 
Education and Informed Consent Process:  The consent process will start with an introductory 
paragraph that describes the study. This statement will be followed by a description of the purpose 
of the research. Next, the procedures will be desc ribed and the time duration of the procedures 
and study. The participant will be notified of the discomforts and risks along with the potential 
benefits. The participant will receive a Statement of Confidentiality . The participant will be notified 
as to the costs for participation  (none)  as well as the compensation for participation. The 
participant will be made aware of the research funding  source . The participant will be given 
information regarding the fact that their participation is voluntary. The par ticipant will  then be given 
the contact [CONTACT_156491]. Finally, the participant will be asked for their 
signature [CONTACT_156543].  
 
Plan for Review of Consent Document:  The signed  consent document will be confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_156417]. Williams and will be rechecked by [CONTACT_156495] .  
 
Documentation of Signed Consent:  The NCCIH Site Screening and Enrollment Log  will be 
utilized to record the consent and screening of all subjects and the outcome of each screening. 
This log will provide a comprehensive list of all subjects who were screened for eligibility and this  
information will be  maintained electronically  in REDCAP . Subjects  will be recorded  as they are 
consented  in order  to ensure completeness and accuracy of the data. All subjects who were 
consented and screened  will be included in this long,  including screen failures. This log will not 
contain identifying information. Subjec ts will be tracked separately on logs in a coded list with a 
key. Each page will be numbered and maintained in this log in the Essential Documents Binder ,

Screening  Visit  
 
During screening, participants will be screened using  the following:  
 
Hypnotic Induction Profile (HIP):  This is a clinician -administered instrument. Will allow for 
assessment of level of hypnotizability (113) . Those individuals with a score of 0 -8 (low-moderately 
hypnotizable)  on the HIP will be selected in order to prevent a potential ceiling effect (26). HIP will 
be assessed twice during the in -person screening visit.  
 
2010 Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Criteria:  This is a clinician -administered instrument. Participants 
must fulfill diagnostic criteria for FMS (1). This gold -standard assessment  will be utilized  to 
ascertain that the participant does in fact meet standardized criteria for FMS. It is important to 
establish the formal FMS diagn osis to have a homogenous group of participants.  
 
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH) Antidepre ssant Treatment Response Qu estionnaire 
(ATRQ) : This is a clinician -administered instrument. Participants taking SSRIs will be asked if 
they are willing to discontinue (114) . Participants actively taking antidepressant s will be offered a 
wash -out or excluded  for theoretical seizure risk (102) . This form is an established tool that allows 
for the assessment of past and current antidepressant use in depression and pain (114) . 
 
The Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I):  The MINI is a short structured 
diagnostic interview, developed jointly by [CONTACT_156496] -IV (DSM -IV) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10th 
revision psychiatric disorders. The M.I.N.I.  was designed to meet the need for a short but accurate 
structured  psychiatric interview for multicenter clinical trials and epi[INVESTIGATOR_156418] a first step in outcome tracking in non -research clinical settings (115) .  
 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Adult Safety Screen (TASS):  This is a participant self -report  
instrument. Parti cipants will fill out a TASS questionnaire to determine risk of seizure related to 
rTMS (88). Any identified seizure risk will disqualify the participant. This assessment  is utilized in 
order  to minimize the risk of seizure induction with rTMS.  
 
MRI Safety Screening Form : This is a participant self-report  instrument. Participant will fill out a 
MRI Safety Screening Form to determine if the participant is safe to receive an MRI. We will utilize 
this screening tool to make sure that the participant has no contraindications for MRI that would 
exclu de the participant from participatin g(89). 
 
Edinburg h Handedness Inventory:  This is a clinician -administered instrument. Participants must 
be right -handed to participate in this study (96). It is standard to restrict rTMS studies to right -
handed  individuals only due to variability in hemispheric dominance  of left -handed individuals .  
 
The Opi[INVESTIGATOR_27310] (ORT):  This is a brief, self -report screening tool designed  for use with adult 
patients in primary care settings to assess risk for opi[INVESTIGATOR_156419] e among individuals prescribed 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_156420].  Patients categorized as high -risk are at increased likelihood 
of future  abusive drug -related behavior  (103) . 
 
The Brief Pain Inventory:  The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_156421] (sensory dimension) and 
interference of pain in the patient's life (reactive dimension). It also queries the patient about pain

  14 MAR 2018  
 relief, pain quality, and patient perception of the cause of pain (116) . The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_156422] (117) . 
 
Short -Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF -MPQ): The SF -MPQ is a shortened version of of  the 
MPQ providing information pertaining to the sensory, affective, and evaluative dimensions of the 
pain experience . 
 
Ishihara Color Vision Test: The Ishihara color vision test will be administered during the screening 
visit to ensure normal color vision  per inclusion criteria.  
 
Sense of Agency Rating Scale (SOARS): This scale is administered in conjuction with the HIP to 
assess the subjective experience of the participant during the HIP.  
 
Tellegens Abso rption Scale (TAS): This scale is administered durin g the screening visit to assess 
the absorption experiences participants have throughout their lives. This scale is shown to be 
correlated with hypnotizability.  
 
Pain Numeric Rating Scale (PNRS): This scale is administered to assess subjective intensity of 
pain.  
 
Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES): This scale is administered to assess dissociative 
experiences participants have throughout their lives.  
 
Screening Complete Form: This checklist includes a  list of all of the obtained screening 
questionnaires t o verify participant eligibility and ensure the completion of all required 
documentation.

Baseline MRI Session for TMS Targeting  
 
TMS Target  Baseline Scan Session:  This scan session includes all  of the  scans 
necessary to identify the r -TMS target for subsequent hypnotic pain and hypnotic 
stroop experimental sessions . 
 MRI Acquisition   
o Structural Acquisition  (T1):  This structural scan is necessary for several 
reasons: demonstration that the participant’s brain is structurally 
normal, imaging analysis, and rTMS targeting  (81).  
o BOLD fMRI Acquisitions  
 Resting State  : Task independent BOLD fMRI will be acquired 
while the participant eyes are open. Individuals with high 
hypnotizability have been demonstrated to have higher 
functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex (DLPFC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate  (dACC)  (31). 
Clusters in t he L -DLPFC identified to have the greatest 
correlation with the dACC will be used for r -TMS targeting.

  14 MAR 2018  
  Thumb Tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] : Alternating right and left thumb tappi[INVESTIGATOR_156423] r -TMS intensity adjustments.  
 Spectroscopy:  Non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(MRS) will be used to quantitatively measure brain metabolites , 
including both inhibitory and excitatory neurotrans mitters  as 
well as markers of inflammation.  
Pre-rTMS Stroop  Assessment  
 
Hypnotic Stroop and Non -Hypnotic Stroop  Pre-rTMS  Scan Session:  This session 
includes all of the pre-rTMS questionnaires, behavioral evaluations and scans 
necessary to compare to the post-rTMS . 
 Medication Washout, Drug Screen, Pregnancy Test Form : This form will be 
administered at the beginning of each pre -rTMS assessment to ensure 
medication washout compliancy (if applicable), document drug screen results, 
and screen for pregnancy (if  applicable).  
 Hypnotic Induction Profile:  This administration of the HIP will serve as the 
baseline measure for comparison after the rTMS stimulation session (87). HIP 
will be measured  on three separate occasions throughout  the stroop 
assessment  visit - 1) immediately following the pre -rTMS stroop MRI session, 
2) immediately following rTMS, and, 3) immediately following the post -rTMS 
stroop MRI session.  
 Stroop Task : This administration of the Stroop task will serve as the baseline 
measure for com parison to the post -rTMS session (32, 118) . 
 Pre-TMS Hypnotizability Scan Session  (1 hour duration)  
o Structural Acquisition  (T1):  This structural scan is necessary for several  
reasons: demonstration  that the participant’s brain is structurally 
normal, imaging analysis, and  rTMS targeting (81).  
o BOLD fMRI Acquisitions  
 Resting State : This is the baseline scan required for the primary 
endpoint. Individuals with high hypnotizability have been 
demonstrated to have higher functional connectivity between 
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the dorsal anterior 
cingulate cor tex (31).  
 
 Stroop Task:  Brain activity while performing conflict tasks has 
been demonstrated to be differen t depending on a subject’s 
level of hypnotizability. This baseline would demonstrate the 
subject’s normal functional brain response to the Stroop Tas k 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  41 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 (32). Functional brain response  to the stroop task will be 
measured following  hypnosis (Hypnotic Stroop) and non-
hypnosis (Non -Hypnotic Stroop) audio instructions. These 
acquisitions will be randomized to prevent order effects. Highly 
hypnotizable individuals can have a loss of the Stroop Effect 
with specif ic post -hypnoitc instruction (119, 120) which 
correlates with the reduction in neural activity during conflict 
(35). 
 
Pre-rTMS Analgesia Assessment  
 
Pre-rTMS Analgesia Session : This hour -long scan session includes all of the pre-rTMS 
questionnaires, behavioral  evaluations , and scans necessary to compare to the post -rTMS . 
 
 Medication Washout, Drug Screen, Pregnancy Test Form : This form will be administered 
at the beginning of each pre -rTMS  assessment to ensure medication washout compliancy 
(if applicable), document drug screen results, and screen for pregnancy (if applicable).  
 
 Pain Thresholds : Baseline heat -pain thresholds  and supra -pain thresholds  will be 
determined  for each  volunteer  based  on responses  to computer -controlled  thermal  stimuli  
delivered  to the left forearm  with a 30 x 30 mm advanced  thermal  stimulator  (ATS)  
thermode  (Medoc  Pathway  Model  ATS). Thresholds  will be measured  using  a standard  
method  of limits  protocol.  Specific ally, thermal  pain threshold  and tolerance  values  will be 
assessed  outside  the MRI scanner  to identify  a moderate  pain intensity  value  that will be 
applied  during  the hypnotic  and non-hypnotic  analgesia  MRI scans . The moderate  pain 
intensity  value  will be used  for both pre- and post-rTMS  analgesia  MRI sessions.  
 
 Hypnotic Induction Profile:  This administration of the HIP will serve as the baseline 
measure for comparison after the rTMS stimulation session (87). HIP will be measured on 
three separate occasions throughout the stroop assessment  visit - 1) immediately 
following the pre -rTMS analgesia MRI session, 2) immediately following rTMS, and, 3) 
immediately following the post -rTMS analgesia MRI session.  
 
 
 Pre-TMS Scans  
o Structural Acquisition  (T1): This structural scan is necessary for several reasons: 
demonstration that the participant’s brain is structurally normal, imaging analysis, 
and rTMS targeting  (81). 
o BOLD fMRI Acquisitions  
 Resting State : This is the baseline scan required for the primary endpoint. 
Individuals with higher hynotizability have been demonstrated to have 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  42 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 higher functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (31).  
 Pain Induction: Functional brain responses to acute, thermally, induced 
pain, will be measured using the moderate pain intensity value following 
hypnosis (Hypnotic Analgesia) and non -hypnosis (Non -Hypnotic 
Analgesia) audio instructions. These acquisitions wi ll be randomized to 
prevent order effects. Hypnotic analgesia during pain induction has been 
demonstrated to be instruction specific (38, 44) and produce alterations in 
functional connectivity (123).  
 
Randomization  
 
The randomization occurs at the time immediately preceding the stimulation session.  The 
stimulation session  will be initiated immediately after randomization.  We will perform 
randomization using permuted block to ensure balancing between arms . The operator is 
instructed to flip the coil to co rrespond with the key code, but is unclear as to the treatment group.   
 
 
6.2.3  Blinding  
 
Blinding and Unblinding methods:  For stimulation sessions , this study utilizes  the Cool -B65 
A/P coil , which has a built -in position sensor used to ensure that the correct (active or sham) side 
of the coil faces towards the patient's head. If the coil position is wrong the operator will get a "Flip 
Coil" prompt on the MagPro screen. To ensure best possible  blinding of patients , the current 
stimulation  pads  (provided with the Cool -B65 A/P coil ) should be used to stimulate the patient's 
skin and simulate the sensation of active rTMS . When a stimulation session  is completed, the 
session  data is stored on both the Patient Key  and the Operator Key . [CONTACT_156544][INVESTIGATOR_156424]. 
Nolan Williams are authorized to break the blind.  
 
Circumstances for Breaking the Blind:  While the safety of the subject always comes first, it is 
important to seriously consider if unblindin g the study randomization assignment is necessary to 
ensure a subject’s safety. In the event of a serious adverse device effect, the PIs will carefully 
assess whether breaking the blind will critically affect how a subject is treated in response to the 
adverse effect and whether this knowledge outweighs the implications to the scientific soundness 
of the study. In the case of most serious a dverse effects, the study  would be discontinued and 
symptoms treated symptomatically irrespective of the knowledge of whether the stimulation  
received was active or sham in nature. In these instances, having this information would not 
significantly alter t he treatment of the adverse effect(s).  As an additional safeguard against bias, 
the Independent Monitoring Committee (IMC)  has been charged with making the final 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_181255]’s source document.  If the decision to break the bl ind is made 
immediately upon learning of the adverse event, this information will be reported to the NCCIH  
and reviewing IRB at the time of initial adverse event reporting. If the unblinding occurs after the 
initial reporting, the NCCIH  will be notified of  the action within ten working days from the time of 
breaking the blind. The reviewing IRB will be notified according to their reporting guidelines if the 
decision is made to break the study blind after the initial reporting.  
Procedure for Breaking the Blind at Study Completion:  To minimize any source of bias, 
unblinding of the study will not be done until all subjects have completed all study phases. 
However, unblinding will occur if the Independent Monitoring Committee , consistent with their 
assigned c harter and associated stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], determines that it necessary to do so.  At the end 
of the study Patient Keys  are returned to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_156425]. The MagPro  
double -blinded research system ensures efficacy, accuracy and consistency.  The system comes 
with a MagLink  software program specifically developed for data collection in double -blinded 
studies. The program is used to define the stimulation  protocol for ea ch patient (real or sham 
stimulation ).

Post -rTMS Stroop Assessment  
 
Hypnotic Stroop and Non -Hypnotic Stroop  Pre-rTMS  Scan Session:  This session 
includes all of the post-rTMS  behavioral evaluations and scans necessary to compare 
to the pre-rTMS . 
 Hypnotic Induction Profile:  This administration of the HIP will serve as the post-
rTMS  measure for comparison to the pre -rTMS stimulation session.  
 Post-TMS Hypnotizability Scan Session (1 hour dur ation)  
o Structural Acquisition  (T1):  This structural scan is necessary for several 
reasons: demonstration that the participant’s brain is structurally 
normal, imaging analysis, and rTMS targeting (81).  
o BOLD fMRI Acquisitions  
 Resting State : This is the scan required for evaluation of the 
primary endpoint. Individuals with high hypnotizability h ave 
been demonstrated to have higher functional connectivity 
between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the dorsal 
anterior cingulate cortex (31).  
 
 Stroop Task:  Brain activity while performing conflict tasks has 
been demonstrated to be different depend ing on a subject’ s 
level of hypnotizability. These  scans will  demonstrate the 
subject’s functional brain response to the Stroop Task  post-
rTMS . Functional brain response to the stroop  task will be 
measured following hypnosis (Hypnotic Stroop) and non -
hypnosis (Non -Hypnotic Stroop) audio instructions. 
Randomization of hypnosis and non -hypnosis scan order for 
each participant will be kept consistent between both pre - and 
post-rTMS scans . Highly hypnotizable individuals can have a 
loss of the Stroop Effect with specific post -hypnoitc instruction 
(119, 120) which correlates with the reduction in neural activity

Post -rTMS Analgesia Assessment  
 
Post-rTMS Analgesia Session:  This hour -long scan session includes all of the post-rTMS 
behavioral  evaluations and scans necessary to compare to the pre-rTMS . 
 Hypnotic Induction Profile:  This administration of the HIP will serve as the baseline 
measure for comparison after the rTMS stimulation session (87). 
 Pre-TMS Scans

 Resting State : This is the baseline scan required for the primary endpoint. 
Individuals with higher hynotizability have b een demonstrated to have 
higher functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (31).  
 Pain Induction: Using the same moderate thermal pain values identified 
above, f unctional brain responses  to ac ute pain, will be measured following 
hypnosis (Hypnotic Analgesia) and non -hypnosis (Non -Hypnotic 
Analgesia) audio instructions. Randomization of hypnosis and non -
hypnosis scan order for each participant will be kept consistent between 
both pre - and post -rTMS scans.  Hypnotic analgesia during pain induction 
has been demonstrated to be instruction specific (38, 44) and produce 
alterations in functional connectivity (123).  
 
MR Spectroscopy Assessment  (Optional)  
 
 Imaging Procedure  
o Structural Acquisition  (T1/T2/DWI ): A structural scan will be acquired for imaging 
analysis.  
o 1H-MRS Spectroscropy: MEGA -PRESS (GABA /Glx) and NFL -PRESS  (Broad 
spectra) spectroscopy sequences will be acquired bilaterally within the left and 
right DLPFC using a cutting -edge automated voxel placement procedure that 
precisely targets the identified connectivity coordinates.  
o Resting State fMRI: A BOLD fMRI acquisition will be acquired while the participant 
is at rest to assess functional connectivity between the insula and DLPFC 
(bilatera lly) 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_181260] Screening:  The Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Adult Safety Screen (TASS)  will be 
utilized to confirm that the potential participant does not have any conditions or devices that would 
contraindicate rTMS (TBS) administration  (101) . We will use the  MRI screening form to assure 
that there are no  contraindications to MRI scanning  (89). 
 
MRI Practices:  The CRCs will be trained to ensure that  the participant does not enter into the MRI 
room with any ferromagnetic objects (89). 
 
Motor Threshold Acquisition : The participant’s motor threshold  will be determined to be  accurate 
through the use  of a combination of PEST software  (90), visualization,  EMG monitoring  (91), and 
neuroimaging of the cortical target of the hand representation.  The MT will be attained twice in 
order to assure accuracy.  Each MT acquisition will be performed by a separate TMS operator and 
the lower of the two MT acquisition trials will be utilized.  
 
Dose Calculation : The dose ( 80% of the  rMT) will be assured to be  calculated correctly. Two 
separate calculations will be done to assure that the dose was correctly calculated.  
 
 
7.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety 
Parameters  
 
 
Monitoring of Mental Status  during rTMS : All personnel will be familiar with the procedures for 
subject screening for risk factors prior to treatment, individual risks and potential benefits for 
specific subjects, appropriate discussion of the risks and potential benefits of study participation 
as outlined in the informed consent document, the stimulation parameters to be used in this study, 
monitoring subjects for the potential development of seizures by [CONTACT_156499] (especially the more subtle signs and symptoms of 
frontal lobe seizures), and first responder manag ement in the event of a seizure  (99). All TMS 
treaters will be certified in basic life support training (99).

 7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
 
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, 
symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiological observations occurring in a person who has 
received stimulation  with a  TMS  device  or an MRI scan . The event need not be causally related 
to the TMS  device  or the MRI scan .  
 
 
An AE includes, but is not limited to:  
 
 Any clinically significant worsening of a pre -existing condition;  
 An AE occurring from overdose (i.e., a dose higher than that described in the protocol) of 
a TMS  device, whether accidental or intentional;  
 An AE occurring from abuse (e.g., use for non -study  reasons) of a TMS  device;  
 An AE that has been associated with a preexisting condition is a clinical condition 
(including a condition being treated) that is diag nosed before an informed consent form is 
signed and is documented as part of the subject’s medical history.  
 
 
The questions concerning whether the condition existed before the start of the active phase of 
the study and whether it has increased in severity and/or frequency will be used to determine 
whether an event is a n intervention -emergent AE ( IEAE).  
 
An AE is considered to be intervention -emergent if [1] it was not present when the active phase 
of the study began and is not a chronic condition that is part of the subject’s medical history, or 
[2] it was present at the start of the active phase of the study or as part of the subject’s medical 
history, but the severity or frequency increased during the active phase.  The stimulation  phase of 
the study begins at the time o f the first administration of the TMS stimulation  (active or sham).  
 
For this study, the treatment follow -up period for adverse events is d efined as [ADDRESS_181261] Guidelines and Considerations  48 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 A serious adverse event (SAE)  is defined as an AE that:  
 
 Results in death:  
 Is life threatening (see below)  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]  (see below)  
 Results in a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions, i.e., 
the adverse event resulted in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, 
damage or disruption in the patient's body function/structure, physical activities and/or 
quality of life  
 Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude such impairment  
 Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered SAEs, based upon appropriate medical judgment.   
 
Life threatening  refers to immediate risk of death as the event occurred or use or continued use 
of the  device or other medical product might have resulted in the death per the reporter. A life -
threatening event does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death, but as it actually occurred, did not create an imme diate risk of death.   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_156426]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17128].   
 
Note : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_156427], for a preex isting condition that has 
not worsened, do not constitute an SAE (e.g., elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a total knee replacement 
due to a preexisting condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened during the study).   
 
An adverse event of specia l interest is a device -specific adverse event  designated by [CONTACT_978]  
[INVESTIGATOR_156428], even if it does not meet serious reporting 
criteria. For this protocol, seizure should be reported as an adverse event of special interest .  
 
If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes an SAE, the information should be treated 
as an SAE for the purpose of this study.  
 
 
Timing for Reporting of Serious Adverse Events:  Any SAE, regardless of causal relationship, 
must be reported immediately to the Independent Monitoring Committee (within one business 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  49 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 day) by [CONTACT_29658] a completed serious adverse event form to  the chair of the committee, [CONTACT_156545] . Compliance with this time requirement is essential so that the Sponsor may comply 
with its regulatory obligations.  Follow -up information relating to an SAE will be reported to the 
Independent Monitoring Committee  and the NCCIH within one business day after the information  
is sent to  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_156429] a completed serious adverse event form to  the chair of the committee, 
[CONTACT_156546] . The subject should be observed and monitored carefully until the condition 
resolves or stabilizes or its cause is identified.  Any emerge ncy will be reported to NCCIH and the 
Independent Monitoring Committee  immediately (within one business day) by [CONTACT_156500]. 
Alan Schatzberg . 
 
Data Collected to Assess Safety  During rTMS : Treat ers will be monitoring subjects for the 
potential development of seizures by [CONTACT_156501] (especially the more subtle signs and symptoms of frontal lobe seizures), and 
first responder management in the even t of a seizure. The study personnel  have immediate (i.e., 
within minutes) availability of more sophisticated medical support, including access to an 
emergency room, in the event that a seizure is not a self -limited event, access to antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_24568] s, and to life support equipment including oxygen, suction, blood pressure monitoring 
and cardiopulmonary (CPR) equipment.  
 
Seizure and t he following are AE’s that will be reported at solicited events:  
 
Table 2: Adverse events with an incidence in a ctive rTMS at a rate of > 5% and at least 2x sham 
in the safety exposure study p opulation .  These symptoms have occurred only during and not 
after rTMS administration . 
7.[ADDRESS_181262] Guidelines and Considerations  50 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 Research staff will be trained to attend to signs of adverse events (AE) and to report any potential 
AE immediately to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_156430]. If adverse events occur, appropriate medical and/or psychiatric care will be 
offered immediately to the research participant, and an official written report will be completed 
using the Stanford University Human Subjects Adverse Event form and submitted to the 
Institutional Review Board at Stanford University and NIH within 7 days. The N CCIH Pro gram  
Officer will be informed of any actions taken by [CONTACT_3016] a result of any adverse events within  
7 days of notification by [CONTACT_1201] (e.g. study modifications imposed by [CONTACT_1201]).  
 
Adverse events will be monitored continuously by [CONTACT_156502] [INVESTIGATOR_156431], including adverse 
events, are reported to the IRB in compliance with their requirements for reporting serious and 
unexpected adverse events. Reporting wil l be conducted in compliance with guidelines specified 
by [CONTACT_156503] . All subjects will have telephone and 
email contact [CONTACT_156504] [INVESTIGATOR_156432]. [CONTACT_156547][INVESTIGATOR_156433] [ADDRESS_181263]’s last study visit regardless of relationship to the protocol or TMS device. This 
includes events t hat emerge during the pre -study screening phase. All AEs and SAEs will be 
recorded on source documents and recorded on the subject’s case report forms ( CRFs ). All AEs 
and SAEs that occur after the pre -study screening period will be recorded on the subject’s CRFs, 
which will be provided to the NCCIH . The Independent Monitoring Committee (IMC)  will instruct 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_156434], SAEs, and other reportable events until the event has  
subsided or values have returned to baseline, or in case of permanent impairment, until the 
condition stabilizes.  The Investigator will provide all relevant documentation pertaining to an SAE 
(e.g., additional laboratory tests, consultation reports, disch arge summaries, postmortem reports, 
etc.) to the IMC and NC CIH in a timely manner. Reports relative to the subject’s subsequent 
course will be submitted to the IMC and NCCIH  until the event has subsided or, in case of 
permanent impairment, until the condit ion stabilizes.  Other information reportable to the IMC and 
NCCIH , while not meeting the definition of an AE, is reportable to NCCIH and the IMC with the 
timeliness of an SAE.  
 
This includes:  
 Seizure  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  51 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
  Pregnancy occurring during the study period in which th e subject was exposed to the TMS 
device;  
 Overdose (e.g., a dose higher than that prescribed by a healthcare professional for clinical 
reasons) with or without AEs;  
 Abuse (e.g., use for non -clinical reasons) with or without an AE;  
 Inadvertent or accidental exposure with or without an AE;  
 Device malfunction that would likely result in death, serious injury or other significant 
adverse event.  
 
At each required study visit, all AEs that have occurred since the previous visit will be recorded in 
the adverse event record of the subject’s CRF. The information recorded should be based on the 
signs or symptoms detected during the physical examination and clinical evaluation of the subject.  
 
In addition to the information obtained from those sources, the subject should be asked the 
following nonspecific question: "How have you been feeling since your last visit?" Signs and 
symptoms will be recorded using standard medical terminology.  
 
The following AE information must be included (when applicable): the specific condition or event 
and direction of change; whether the condition was preexisting (i.e., an acute condition present 
at the start of the study  or history of a chronic condition) and, if so, whether it has worsened (e.g., 
in severity and/or frequency); the dates and times of occurrence; severity; causal relationship to 
the TMS device; action taken; and outcome.  
 
Causal relationship options and de finitions are as follows:  
 
 Definitely related:  Event can be fully attributable to administration of the TMS  stimulation  
or the MRI device . 
 Probably related:  Event is most likely to be explained by [CONTACT_156505] , rather than  the subject’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 Possibly related:  Event is as likely explained by [CONTACT_156506] , as by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 Probably not related:  Event is most likely to be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or 
other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], rather than the TMS  stimulation  or MRI device . 
 Definitely not related:  Event can be fully explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other 
agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], rather than the TMS  stimulation  or MRI device . 
 
When assessing the relationship between an investigational product/protocol and an AE, the 
following parameters are considered:  
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  52 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
  Temporal relationship between the TMS device/protocol and the AE  
 Biologic plaus ibility of relationship  
 Subjects’ underlying clinical state or concomitant agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
 Where applicable, whether the AE abates on discontinuation of the TMS device or MRI 
device (de-challenge)  
 Where applicable, whether the AE reappears on repeat expos ure to the TMS device or 
MRI device (re-challenge)  
 
Sensations of pain (needle -like sensation, hurting) during the ~45 second TMS sessions will be 
an expected AE.  
SAEs that are not TMS/MRI  device -related may nevertheless be considered by [CONTACT_11097] [INVESTIGATOR_156435], i.e., to a subject's participation 
in the study.

it is in the best interest of the subject to be withdrawn .  
 
 
Discontinuation information [e.g., date and the reason(s) for discontinuation] must be recorded in 
the subject’s CRF  (i.e., Study Completion Form).  
 
 
Subjects withdrawn from the study due to an AE will be followed up for [ADDRESS_181266]’s CRF.  
 
 
Subjects will be encouraged to remain compliant with all expected study visits. Non -adherence to 
expected study visits will be documented and may result in removal from the study. This will be 
clearly discussed during the consent/assent process and reinforced throughout the study through 
regular screening for issues with compliance.

 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 
9.1 General Design Issues   
 
 
Statistical Hypotheses:  In the Primary Mechanistic Hypothesis  (previously functional 
connectivity portion of H ypothesis 1a -in grant ), we will examine the effect of active rTMS on the 
functional connectivity between L-DLPFC and dACC.  In the Relevant  Clinical Hypothesis  
(previously Hypothesis 2b), we will examine the effect of active rTMS on hypnotic analgesia .  In 
Secondary Hypothesis  B (previously Hypothesis 1b -in grant) , we will examine the effect of rTMS 
on hypnotizability and hypnotic intensity using the same analytical strategy. In  Secondary 
Hypotheses E (previously Hypotheses 2a in grant) , we will repeat our investigation with various 
secondary outcomes including activation and connectivity among anterior cingulate, dorsolateral, 
insular, and somatosensory cortices. Finally, we will explore w hether the effect of rTMS on 
hypnotizability is mediated by [CONTACT_156507].  
 
Rationale for  Study Design:  The randomized, double -blind, counterbalanced, mechanistic 
clinical trial design allows for the most definitive  assessment of the feasibility of modulating the 
neural circuitry  underlying hypnotizability  with rTMS  along with the measu ring the effects  of this 
neuro modulation  strategy  on the underlying neural circuitry . The same subjects are utilized for 
both scan session days , that is, for the hypnotic stroop  scan session (to address the hypnosis  
stroop interference  aims ) and for the hypnotic analgesia scan session (to address hypnotic 
analgesia aims ). The rationale  for using the same sample twice is to achieve sufficient statistical 
power with the moderate sample size. The order will be counterbalanced  and the two groups 
(rTMS versus  sham) will be cross -sectionally compared  treating  the contrast (baseline vs post 
rTMS) as one univariate outcome , which is customary  in imaging studies.  
 
Washout Period:  Due to risk of seizure  (97), we will implement a  washout period  for all 
psychoactive medications  (99, 102)  that will be implemented prior to the first scan session and 
continued through to the second scan session day.  For all antidepressant  medications  other than 
fluoxetine, there will be a 2 -week washout. For fluoxetine, there will be a 5 -week washout 
period (102) . The reason for 2 weeks for all antidepressants except fluoxetine (5 weeks) has to do 
with the half-life of the antidepressants (102) . We will only washout those individuals who are 
taking antidepressants for pain. We will not wash out antidepressant prescribed for depression 
due to the risk of exacerbating  depression. If participants find this portion of the study intolerable 
from a mood/pain standpoint, we will exclude the participant prior to the scanner portion of the 
study  and this participant will be considered a screen failure and replaced.  
 
The safety monitoring protocol for the  medication wash -out has been successfully employed in 
two former randomized controlled trials for suicide prevention in which the Chair of the 
Independent Monitoring Committee was a mentor (DOD/MSRC [W81XWH -10-2-0178] and NIH 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  56 of 99 Version 1. 3

 [K23MH093490]). All procedure s will be closely supervised by [CONTACT_9154] s and on -site 
Independent Monitoring Committee, [CONTACT_156548] (Mood Disorders Expert). Suicide risk 
assessment will be conducted using empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -established risk categorizations (minimal, mild, 
moderate, sever e, imminent) to routinize clinical decision -making and emergency referral 
procedures for suicidal behaviors. This study will utilize a comprehensive, in -built infrastructure 
and set of standard operating procedures that support safe conduct of the current trial. Based on 
evidence -based best practices in standardized risk assessment and management, subjects at 
imminent risk will be referred for immediate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Proposed procedures have been used 
in previous IRB -approved proposals consistent with DS MP protocols employed by [CONTACT_6283]. 
Schatzberg.  
 
Best practices in suicide risk assessment and management procedures will be reviewed at the 
outset of the anti -depressant washout with all individuals requiring this intervention, as a central 
component to the in formed consent process. Notification of next of kin procedures, and 
permission to contact [CONTACT_156508] a no -show or elevation in risk, will be reviewed 
prior to study enrollment, in addition to all confidential and non -confidential refer ral resources 
available to the participant in the event of an elevation in symptoms. Participants will be referred 
to a supervising clinician if a participant experiences distress at any point during the medication 
wash -out. This will prompt standardized s uicide risk assessment according to established 
frameworks. All safety and risk assessment interactions will be closely supervised by a licensed 
clinician, and thoroughly documented. [ADDRESS_181267] thro ughout the wash out period. The PIs will oversee on -call (via pager) [ADDRESS_181268] in evaluating suicide risk and need for mental health services using an

The SSI -C will be administered on the phone weekly as well as if the individual calls in with 
distress. A score > [ADDRESS_181269] and Suicide Assessment Decisi on Tree (See Below).

 Primary Mechanistic Objective  and Relevant Clinical Objective  
 
Primary Mechanistic Objective:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (continuous 
theta -burst stimulation -cTBS) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L -DLPFC) on modulating the 
neural network that underlies hypnotizability  and hypnosis . In other words, t he Primary  
Mechanistic  Outcome Measure  is the change in functional connectivity between the L -DLPFC 
and the dACC  and associated reduction in activity in the L -DLPFC and dACC  in active versus 
sham rTM S.  
 
Primary Mechanistic Hypothesis:  Active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will modulate 
the neural network that underlies hypnotizability  and hypnosis  by [CONTACT_156509] L -DLPFC and dACC  as compared to sham rTMS (sham cTBS).  
We hypothesize that active, inhibitory rTMS (continuous theta -burst stimulation) will produce 
increases in functional connectivity between the L -DLPFC and the dACC  (47), producing a 
transient phenotype  (30) appearing on neuroimaging like a high hypnotizable  (31).  This increase 
in functional connectivity, coupled with inhibition of activity in the DLPFC, would be 
hypothesized to reduce activity in the dACC as well, which is what we have shown to be 
associated with entry into the hypnotic state.  Thus rTMS induced increase in functional 
connectivity should increase hypnotizability and, coupled with inhibited activity, enhance hypnotic 
intensity as well.  
 
Validity of the A pproach:  Resting -state fMRI has survived the (appropriate) initial skepticism 
with which it was met (134)  and has been buttressed by [CONTACT_156510] (135-137) 
supporting a neural origin of these BOLD signal fluctuations.  Ad vances in artifact reduction (138-
140) and analysis (141)  have proceeded apace and the reproducibility of this method has been 
established (142) .  Resting -state fMRI has emerged as among the most rapi[INVESTIGATOR_156438] -fields 
of functional imaging.  Functional connectivity MRI has been proposed to be the optimal method 
for tracking rTMS -induced changes in the human brain  (53). 
 
Reliability of the A pproach:  It has been demonstrated across multiple studies that both 
traditional rTMS as well as theta -burst stimulation  (56, 57)  is capable of modulating functional 
connectivity (54). This approach has been assessed not only in the motor system, but also across 
numerous cortical nodes, including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  (46, 47, 143) . 
 
Relevant  Clinical  Objective:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -
DLPFC on enhancing HA -related reduction in nociception.  
Relevant  Clinical Hypothesis : Active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will enhance HA 
as compared to sham rTMS (sham cTBS).  
Validity of the A pproach:  HA has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing subjective pain 
sensation in both normal controls (144)  as well as participants with FMS (7).  Thermal  pain has 
been demonstrated to be fiber specific (145) .  
Reliability of the A pproach:  Thermal pain as an experimental pain paradigm is a highly validated 
approach for activating pain fibers and the neural structures that are connected to these pain 
fibers (146-149). Hypnotic analgesia has been demonstrated to be a physiological phenomenon 
that is reliable in highly hypnotizable individuals (150, 151) .

 Secondary Objectives  
 
Secondary Objective A:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on modulating the neural network that underlies hypnotic intensity.  
Secondary Hypothesis A:  Active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS ) over L -DLPFC will modulate the neural 
network that underlies hypnotic intensity by [CONTACT_156465] L -DLPFC and dACC as 
compared to sham rTMS (sham cTBS) as measured by [CONTACT_156511] -BOLD.  
Validity of the A pproach:  Hypnotic intensity is strongly correlated with measured hypnotizability  
(133) . rTMS has been demonstrated to affect hypnotizability and it is suspected that rTMS  (TBS) 
(26) will therefore affect the neural networks that underlie hypnotic intensity  (133) .  
Reliability of the A pproach:  It has been demonstrated that both the BOLD and functional 
connectivity measures are statistically, significantly different in the hypnotic state as in comparison 
to the resting, waking state  (133, 152) . 
 
Secondary Objective B:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on enhancing hypnotizability  (as measured by [CONTACT_156461] -HIP and Stroop 
Task) and hypnotic intensity (as measured by [CONTACT_156462] -HIS).  
Secondary Hypothesis B:  Active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will increase the HIP 
and HIS scores as well as Stroop Effect as compared to sham rTMS (sham cTBS).  
Validity of the A pproach:  It has been previously demonstrated that inhibitory rTMS over the L -
DLPFC can modulate the level of hypnotizability of the subject  (26). Because rTMS has been 
demonstrated to affect hypnotizability and it is suspected that rTMS  (26) will therefore affect 
hypnotic intensity  (133) . It has been demonstrated that rTMS can manipulate the Stroop effect bi -
directionally, in a frequency -dependent manner  (118, 153, 154) . It has also been demonstrated 
that performance on conflict tasks such as  the Stroop task and the flanker task are correlated with 
hypnotizability  (32).  
Reliability of the A pproach:  It has been demonstrated across numerous studies that rTMS is 
capable of modulating cognitive tasks in a frequency -dependent manner  (155-157). 
 
Secondary Objective C:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS  (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on the neural network underlying the conflict regulation system as a reflection of effective 
modulation of the neural circuitry underlying hypnotizability.  
Secondary Hypothesis C : Active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will modul ate the neural 
network that underlies conflict regulation system  by [CONTACT_156512] (rIFG)  and the connectivity of the rIFG to the default mode network (DMN).  
Validity of the A pproach:  Difference in hypnotizability  has been correlated with difference in 
neural strategy for conflict tasks such as the Stroop task and the flanker task  (32). 
Reliability of the A pproach:  It has been demon strated that both the BOLD and functional 
connectivity measures are reliable across numerous studies  (51). 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  59 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 Secondary Objective D: To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on the neural network underlying pos t-hypnotic Stroop Effect.  
Secondary Hypothesis D: Post-hypnotic instruction of word blindness after active, inhibitory 
rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will reduce dACC activity during the Stroop task (similar to high 
hypnotizables) as compared to sham rTMS (sham cTBS).  
Validity of the A pproach:  It has been demonstrated that a post -hypnotic instruction of word 
blindness  will produce a loss of the Stroop Effect in highly hypnotizable individuals  (119, 120) . It 
has also been demonstrated that the loss of the Stroop Effect is correlated with reduction in 
conflict signaling in the dorsal anterior cingulate  (35). 
Reliability of the A pproach:  It has been demonstrated across numerous studies that the post -
hypnotic instruction of word blindness is capable of eliminating the neural response to the Stroop 
task (35, 36) . 
 
Secondary Objective E: To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on modulating the neural network that und erlies hypnotic analgesia (HA).  
Secondary Hypothesis E: Active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS ) over L -DLPFC will modulate the neural 
network that underlies HA by [CONTACT_133239] a decrease in activity and an increase functional 
connectivity among the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral, insular, and somatosensory cortices 
(hypnotic analgesia network) as co mpared to sham rTMS (sham cTBS).  
Validity of the A pproach:  It has been demonstrated that high hypnotizables have reduced 
activation of the pain system  when thermal pain  is applied and these subjects are under hypnotic 
analgesia (144) . It has been demonstrated that there is a differential brain response between high 
and low hypnotizable individuals with FMS  (7). 
Reliability of the A pproach:  Thermal  pain has been demonstrated to be effective in eliciting 
fiber-specific pain and therefore particular brain activation across numerous studies  (146-149). It 
has been demonstrated that there are circuit -specific changes that can be observed with hypnotic 
analgesia is high hypnotizables  (144) . 
 
Secondary Objective F: To determine the association between metabolic concentrations and 
clinical pain measures.  
Secondary Hypothesis F: L-DLPFC GABA levels will be negatively associated with clinical pain  
measures in participants with FMS.  
Validity of the A pproach  No study has utilized a functional connectivity defined approach  to 
investigate L -DLPFC neurochemistry – a hub for pain modulation and a potential target to 
increase  hypnotizability. To overcome arbitrary MRS voxel placement, especially challenging for 
DLPFC spectroscopy,  we will first identify the L -DLPFC cluster coordinates representing the 
greatest resting state functional  connectivity to the dACC and then use a novel automated 
coordinate -based voxel placement strategy.  
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  60 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 Reliability of the A pproach:  In FMS, changes in MRS signatures and functional connectivity 
have been identified in separate populations [ 175], however,  an association between MRS 
metrics and functional connectivity has not been reported, but could illuminate  mechanisms of 
central network dysfunction.  
 
Secondary Objective G: Determine the relationship between the metabolic alterations pre and 
post-TMS and the association with hypnotic analgesia.  
Secondary Hypothesis F: cTBS neuromodulation of L -DLPFC -dACC  connectivity is mediated 
by [CONTACT_156513] -neuronal cortical pathways measured by [CONTACT_156514] L -DLPFC. 
Neuromodulation  induced by [CONTACT_156515] L -DLPFC -dACC connectivity, but 
the neurochemistry underlying  these changes is unknown.  
Validity of the A pproach : MRS has been used to characterize associations between these 
neurotransmitters in regions of altered functional connectivity in response to acupuncture, 
intermittent TMS (excitatory), or cTBS (inhibitory) 175, 176, 177].  
Reliability of the A pproach:  Implementation of novel image -guided -approach for MRS ensures 
the reliability of voxel placement that is superior to manual voxel placement.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_181270]. This 
study will recruit 100 individuals assuming about 20% missing data due to unusable imaging data 
and dropouts. In the Primary Mechanistic Hypothesis (formerly connectivity portion of Hypothesis 
1a), power  was estimated by [CONTACT_156516]. According to one prior study (47), the change in c onnectivity 
between DLPFC and dACC from pre to post rTMS is change in the quite large (d=0.69). We have 
augmented this one finding with numerous findings from other rTMS connectivity and functional 
activity studies, which demonstrated quite large effect si zes (see table 3 and table 4 below). 
Therefore, a somewhat conservative effect size of d=0.[ADDRESS_181271] -stimulation will be negligible in the sham rTMS group. Given this 
scenario, with the usable samp le of 80 (40 rTMS, 40 sham), the estimated power is 0.8 
(alpha=.05, two -sided). For the Relevant Clinical Hypothesis (formerly Hypothesis 2b) and 
Secondary Hypotheses E (formerly Hypothesis 2a) as well as Secondary Hypotheses A, C, and 
D, both effect sizes  and p -values will be monitored, with more emphasis on gathering information 
on effect sizes.

As our study is a randomized controlled study, in line with the intention to treat principle, our 
primary analysis will be a straightforward comparison of the active versus sham groups using a 
linear model. Following the convention in imaging studies, we will conduct our primary analyses 
treating the contrast (baseline vs post) as one univariate outcome.  The univariate model 
described below can be estimated either using linear regression or analysis of variance 
procedures.  
 
A continuous outcome Y for individual i (i=1,2,3…., N) can be expressed as  
Yi = α + γ Z i + ε i, where α is the mean of the sham group, Z i is the randomized t reatment 
assignment status (0=sham, 1=active), γ is the treatment effect, and ε i ~ N(0, σ2). According to 
random assignment, the estimate of γ will be interpreted as causal effect of treatment assignment.  
 
We do not expect much variation across our narrow ly defined subjects, although some variation 
is still possible. As a way of sensitivity analysis, we will also analyze the data in the linear mixed 
effects modeling framework allowing for random intercepts, although this is not customary in 
imaging studies .  The linear mixed effects model described below will be estimated using the 
maximum likelihood estimation method implemented in SPSS or in Mplus.  
  
 
The outcome Y for individual i at time point t (t = 1,[ADDRESS_181274]) is now expressed as  
 
Yit  = η 0i + η liWt + εit,  (2) 
η0i = η 0  + γ 0Zi   + ζ0i    (3) 
ηli  = η l   + γ lZi    + ζLi    (4)

 where η 0i is the initial status and η li is the linear growth. The set of time scores W t reflects the 
linear growth (0,1) for the pre and post assessments. The residual ε it is allowed to vary across 
time, and is assumed to be normally distributed in out parametric estimation approach. The 
intercepts in (3) -(4) can be interpreted as the main in itial status (η l) and linear growth (η 2) for the 
sham group. The random effect residual ζ 0i is assumed to be normally distributed, whereas ζ Li is 
fixed at zero as we only have two time point data. The effect of treatment on initial status (γ 0) will 
be fixe d at zero in line with the random assignment. The estimate of γ l will be interpreted as causal 
effect of treatment assignment on the pre and post change in the outcome.

 9.3 Stimulation Group Assignment Procedures  
 
Stimulation Group  Assignment Procedures:  Random assignment is a procedure used in 
experiments to create study groups with similar characteristics so that the groups are equivalent 
at the beginning of the study.  We perform randomization using permuted block to ensure 
balancing between arms . 
 
Randomization Rationale and Procedure:  The MagLink  software program is used by [CONTACT_28824] [INVESTIGATOR_156440]. This 
includes defining whether a given patient is to receive real or sham stimulation . When the protocol 
has been defined it is downloaded to a Patient Key (USB memory device) . 
 
Maintenance of Randomization Codes:  In order to use Active/Placebo (A/P) for different 
groups, an Excel spreadsheet with  number series for operators and subjects (active stimulation  
as well as placebo  stimulation ) is stored by a separate clinical research coordinator who is trained 
to maintain the blind . Subjects codes (Randomization Stimulation  Numbers) are followed by 0 or  
1, wher e “0” is placebo stimulation and “ 1” is real stimulation.  
 
Maintaining Appropriate Masking:  All site personnel will be masked to the stimulation group  
assignment  (active versus sham)  for each subject. Specific aspects of the trial design are inten ded 
to optimize the integrity of the masking and all staff will be trained to the procedures for masking 
during the site initiation visit. In addition to those procedures, the treater  will be provided with 
individually sealed and numbered envelopes, corresponding to subject randomization numbers.  
 
Procedures for Planned and Unplanned Breaking of Randomization Codes:  In the case of 
an emergency, an envelope may be opened to identify th e TMS stimulation group  assignment for 
a particular subject. In all circumstances, the Principal Investigator (PI) will notify NCCIH prior to 
unmasking the TMS stimulation group assignment  for any subject, if possible. In the event that 
the emergency circu mstances preclude first notifying NCCIH immediately, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_156441](s) for unmasking and date of opening of 
the envelope must be documented in the subject’s files. The unmasking must also be documen ted 
on the Adverse Event page of the CRF, and in the subject’s source documents. Additionally, the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_879] a written explanation describing the unmasking within 5 working days to NCCIH.  
 
Blinding and Unblinding methods:  For stimulation sessions , MagLink  will require use of the 
Cool-B65 A/P coil that has a built -in position sensor  used to ensure that the correct (active or 
sham) side of the coil faces towards the patient's head. If the coil position is wrong the operator 
will get a "Flip Coil" prom pt on the MagPro screen. To ensure best possible blinding of patients 
the current stimulation provided with the Cool -B65 A/P coil should be used to stimulate the 
patient's skin. When a stimulation session  is completed, the session  data are stored on both t he 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_181275]. Nolan Williams are authorized to 
break the blind.  
 
Circumstances for Breaking the Blind:  In the event of a serious adverse device effect, the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_156442] a 
subject is treated in response to the adverse effect and whether this knowledge outweighs the 
implications to the scientific soundness of the study. In the case of m ost serious adverse effects, 
the study  would be discontinued and symptoms treated symptomatically irrespective of the 
knowledge of whether the stimulation  received was active or sham in nature. In these instances, 
having this information would not signific antly alter the treatment of the adverse effect(s).  As an 
additional safeguard against bias, the IMC has been charged with making the final 
recommendations for breaking the study blind. If the IMC recommends unmasking the study, the 
key to active or sham stimulation  will be obtained  from the unblended CRC . Notation regarding 
the nature of the type of stimulation that  the subject had been receiving will be documented in the 
subject’s source document.  If the decision to break the blind is made immediately up on learning 
of the adverse event, this information will be reported to the NCCIH  and reviewing IRB at the time 
of initial adverse event reporting. If the unblinding occurs after the initial reporting, the NCCIH  will 
be notified of the action within ten wor king days from the time of breaking the blind. The reviewing 
IRB will be notified according to their reporting guidelines if the decision is made to break the 
study blind after the initial reporting.  
 
Procedure for Breaking the Blind at Study Completion:  To minimize any source of bias, 
unblinding of the study will not be done until all subjects have completed all study phases. 
However, unblinding will occur if the Independent Monitoring Committee , consistent with their 
assigned charter and associated stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_004], determines that it necessary to do so.  At the end 
of the study Patient Keys are returned to the principal i nvestigator for data analysis. The MagPro 
double -blinded research system ensures efficacy, accuracy and consistency.  The system comes 
with a MagLink  software program specifically developed for data collection in double -blinded 
studies. The program is used to define the stimulation  protocol for each patient (real or sham 
stimulation ). 
 
9.4  Definition of Populations  
 
We will compare individuals assigned to the active rTMS condition and individuals assigned to 
the sham condition as randomized in line with the ITT principle. Noncompliance with rTMS (or 
sham) is not expected, although in that case, we will compare groups as randomized regardless 
of the compliance status in line with ITT. Missing assessment due to unusable imaging data or 
dropout will be handled as missing at random conditional on observed information.  
  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_181276] every six months. Serious adverse events will be reviewed 
on a monthly basis, unless a more urgent review is requested. Only under ex treme circumstances 
or if it were determined that a high level of side effects was due to TMS  and/or MRI , would the 
IMC be charged with breaking the study mask.  This study will be stopped prior to its completion 
if: [1] the intervention is associated with adverse effects that call into question the safety of the 
intervention; [2] difficulty in study recruitment or retention will significantly impact the ability to 
evaluate the study endpoints; [3] any new information becomes available during the trial that 
necessitates stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098] ; or [4] other situations occur that might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_90348] . 
 
 
9.6 Outcomes  
 
 
9.6.1 Primary Outcome s  
 
 
Primary  Mechanistic  Outcome Measure : To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS  
(cTBS)  over L-DLPFC on modulating the connectivity of the neural network that underlies 
hypnotizability . 
 
This study will  test an augmentation approach where one modality  (rTMS)  (30) is being used to 
modulate  the neural circuitry underlying another technique (hypnotizability)  in an effort that this 
combinatory approach may transiently produce  the high hypnotizable phenotype on formal 
testing (31). It will be determined if modulation of the neural circuitry that underl ies hypnotizability  
with rTMS can potentially produce  a brain conn ectivity pattern that resembles a high ly 
hypnotizabl e individual (31). This study  propose s to measure the change in hypnotizability by 
[CONTACT_156517] L -DLPFC and dACC  at pre- and post-rTMS 
for both rTMS  conditions (active versus  sham cTBS ) (31).

 fMRI Preprocessing and Analysis : All fMRI data will be preprocessed and analyzed using FSL 
(FMRIB Software Library, version 5.0) (88). Physiological signals will first be removed using 
RETROICOR and RVHRCOR (97, 98). The first [ADDRESS_181277] preprocessing steps will then be applied: motion correction 
using least square minimization (99), removal of non -brain tissues (100), resampling to 2 x 2 x 2 
mm3 voxels, spatial smoothing with a 6 mm full -width at half -maximum (FWHM ) Gaussian kernel 
to improve functional alignment between participants, and mean -based intensity normalization of 
all volumes by [CONTACT_156518] a Gaussian -weighted least -
squares straight line fitting, and linear regis tration using the FMRIB’s Linear Registration Tool 
(FLIRT, 6 degrees of freedom (DOF)) to T1 -weighted anatomical images and Montreal 
Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space.  
 
For each run, a first -level general linear model (GLM) will be conducted usin g FMRIB’s improved 
linear model prewhitening convolved using a boxcar regressor model (101) . Across runs and for 
each contrast, a within -subject fixed effects analysis will be performed. For group analysis, 
FMRIB’s local analysis of mixed effects will be used within a mask of our a priori ROIs dACC and 
L-DLPFC, thresholded using family -wise error (FWE) corrected Z>2.3; cluster p<0.05. Average 
contrast of parameter estimate values will be extracted from our ROIs and Spearman’s 
correlations will be calculated between these values and differences in  active versus sham rTMS . 
 
Primary Mechanistic Hypoth esis: Active, inhibitory rTMS  (cTBS)  over L-DLPFC will modulate 
the neural network that underlies hypnotizability by [CONTACT_156519] L -DLPFC and dACC . 
 
Connectivity between L -DLPFC and dACC will be assessed  with resting state functional 
connectivity MRI (31, 51)  at the baseline time-point  and as well as at the post-rTMS  time-point  for 
both rTMS  conditions  (active and sham ). It is hypothesize d that inhibitory rTMS  (cTBS)  to DLPFC 
will result in increased fc between the DLPFC and dACC.  Analyses  will be  restricted  to the dACC  
and L-DLPFC for th e Primary Outcome Measure . To determine if the active rTMS condition is 
specifically associated with change in dACC and D LPFC functional connectivity , a mask restricted 
to dACC and DLPFC  will be utilized  to extract the fMRI connectivity  data. It is expect ed that  the 
correlation in active rTMS  group  over L-DLPFC to be stronger than the correlation obtained in the 
sham rTMS  group. Regression analysis will be used to investigate whether greater connectivity 
will be present between L-DLPFC and dACC for active versus sham rTMS  (cTBS) .  Activity in 
both regions will be measured using  the fractional amplitude of low -frequency fluctuation (fALFF) 
of the fMRI signal to measure the amplitude of regional spontaneous activity throughout the brain . 
(164)  It is a ratio of the power spectrum of low -frequency (0.01 -0.08 Hz) to that of the entire 
frequency range, thereby [CONTACT_156520].

This aim explores if active  rTMS  + HA  will have produce greater anti -nociceptive effects on  pain 
thresholds than sham rTMS. I nhibitory rTMS  (cTBS) will be applied  to L-DLPFC and  it is expect ed 
that the stimulation -induced augmentation of hypnotic analgesia will be greater in the active rTMS 
condition over the sham rTMS  condition . It is expect ed that the strength of this correlat ion will be 
greater than in the active rTMS + HA condition versus sham rTMS + HA given that the hypothesi s 
is that the rTMS will increase fc between L-DLPFC and dACC which is believed to  transiently 
modulate  these participants to have similar response  to hypnotic analgesia as do high 
hypnotizables (31) given the 0.6 correlation between measured hypnotizability and the ability to 
achieve hypnotic analgesia.  HA network activation/connectivity to painful thermal stimulation will 
be assessed at baseline , during pre-rTMS  hypnotic analgesia , after rTMS , and during post -rTMS 
HA. Changes in mean pain ratings between baseline pain and active rTMS  + HA (TBS)  and sham 
rTMS  + HA  conditions will be compared using ANOVA. It is expect ed that there will b e a 
significantly greater mean decrease in pain ratings with the active rTMS  + HA  than the sham rTMS  
+ HA  condition at the p<0.05, level.  
 
Relevant  Clinical Hypothesis : Active, inhibitory rTMS over DLPFC will enhance hypnotic 
analgesia as compared to sham rTMS.  
 
It is hypothesize d that the rTMS modulation  in hypnotizability (26) will result in greater hypnotic 
analgesia  than sham rTMS . It is expect ed that  a significantly greater mean increase across 
measures active rTMS than with the sham rTMS conditi on at the p<0.05, level. This hypothesis 
will be tested with linear mixed modeling. It is hypothesize d that the rTMS modulation will result 
in greater analgesia than sham rTMS. This study  will measure the response to thermal pain stimuli 
at baseline and af ter active rTMS versus sham rTMS. In particular, it is hypothesize d that the 
temperature necessary to produce threshold level heat pain  during the pre -TMS period  will not 
produce pain following active rTMS  + HA . The temperature  for evoking threshold and mo derate 
pain will be assessed prior to and at 5 -minute intervals for 30 min utes following the application of 
rTMS  + HA .  It is expect ed that the active rTMS stimulation + HA  will temporarily eliminate pain 
following thermal  stimulation at an intensity, which produced threshold level pain prior to rTMS  + 
HA.  It is also hypothesize d that temperatures that  produced moderate pain prior to rTMS will be 
significantly reduced following active rTMS versus sham. This hypothesis will be tested with linear 
mixed modeling and changes p<.[ADDRESS_181278] Guidelines and Considerations  68 of 99 Version 1. 3

9.6.2 Secondary Outcomes   
 
Secondary Outcome Measure A : To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS  (cTBS)  over 
L-DLPFC on modulating the activity and connectivity of the neural network that underlies the 
hypno tic state .  
 
This study is designed  to measure the change in hypno tic intensity  by [CONTACT_156521] (133) , TMS -BOLD activity (130) , and functional connectivity (133)  between the L -DLPFC 
and dACC  at pre- and post -rTMS  time-points  for both rTMS  conditions (active L-DLPFC rTMS 
(cTBS)  and sham L-DLPFC rTMS  (cTBS) )(31).  
 
Hypno sis Scan s for Secondary  Outcome Measure  A: All participants will receive the same 
identical pre -rTMS resting state scan (31, 51) . After randomization (to either active DLPFC rTMS 
or sham rTMS ) where one half (n=45) will receive active DLPFC rTMS  (spaced cTBS) , and one -
half sham  DLPFC  rTMS  (spaced cTBS)  (n=45) (30), all participant s have their hypnotizability post -
rTMS  scan session (31, 51) .  
 
fMRI Preprocessing and Analysis : All fMRI data will be preprocessed and analyzed using FSL 
(FMRIB Software Library, version 5.0) (88) and in the manner described in the Primary Outcome . 
For group analysis, FMRIB’s local analysis of mixed effects will be used within a mask of our a 
priori ROIs ACC and DLPFC, thresholded using family -wise error (FWE) corrected Z>2.3; cluster 
p<0.05. Average contrast of parameter estimate values will be extracted from our ROIs and 
Spearman’s correlations will be calculated between these values and differences  in active versus 
sham rTMS . 
Secondary  Hypothesi s A: Active, inhibitory rTMS  (cTBS)  over L-DLPFC will modulate the neural 
network that underlies hypnosis  by [CONTACT_156522] L-DLPFC and dACC.  
 
Connectivity between L -DLPFC and dACC will be assessed  with resting state functional 
connectivity MRI (31, 51)  at the baseline time-point  and as well as at the post -rTMS time -point for 
both rTMS  conditions  (active and sham  cTBS ). Analyses  will be restricted  to the dACC  and L-
DLPFC for th is Secondary  Outcome Measure . To determine if rTMS condition  during the hypnotic 
state  is specifically associated with change in dACC and DLPFC activity and functional 
connectivity , a mask restricted to dACC and DLPFC  will be  utilized  to extract the fMRI activity and 
connectivity  data. It is expect ed that  the correlation in active rTMS  group  over L-DLPFC to be 
stronger than the correlation obtained in the sham rTMS  group . Regression analysis will 
determine the strength of the relationship between the reductions of fMRI activity between dACC 
and L-DLPFC during the active versus sham rTMS conditions. Regression analysis will be used 
to investigate whether greater connectivity will be present between L-DLPFC and dACC for active 
rTMS versus sham rTMS.

Secondary Outcome Measure B : To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over 
L-DLPFC on enhancing hypnotizability  (as measured by [CONTACT_156461] -HIP and 
Stroop Task) and hypnotic intensity (as measured by [CONTACT_156462] -HIS).   
 
Augmenting hypnosis with active rTMS may potentially produce an intervention that works better 
(i.e. deeper hyp notic state) and/or extends to a larger part of the population (makes more of the 
population hypnotizable) (26).  
 
Hypnosis Related Measures:  All participants will receive a baseline  Stroop task,  HIP, and HIS. 
After randomization (to either active DLPFC rTMS or sham rTMS ) where one half (n=45) will 
receive active rTMS  (cTBS) , and one -half sham  rTMS  (cTBS)  (n=45) (30), participant will be 
placed back in scanner and their HIS will be reassessed. After the post -rTMS scans,  all 
participant s will be reassessed with the Stroop task and the HIP.  
 
Analysi s of Measures:  Changes in HIP, Stroop Effect, and HIS  between active DLPFC rTMS and 
sham rTMS conditions will be compared using ANOVA. It is expect ed that there will be  a 
significantly greater mean in crease in HIP, HIS, and Stroop Effect  with active rTMS  condition  than 
with the sham rTMS condition at the p<0.05, level.  
 
Secondary Hypothesis B : Active, inhibitory rTMS over DLPFC will increase hypnotizability and 
hypnotic intensity as compared to sham rTMS.  
 
There are four decades of research on the effects of psychopharmacology on hypnotizability 
suggesting that while hypnotizability is a trait, it can be modified for the duration of the 
intervention(70). It is hypothesize d that inhibitory left DLPFC rTMS  (cTBS) will increase 
hypnotizability. It is expect ed that there will be a significant change in the pre -rTMS to post -rTMS 
HIP scores. It is hypothesize d that the change in hypnotic depth (pre -rTMS to post -rTMS) 
achieved will be greater for the active rTMS gro up over the sham rTMS group given the early pi[INVESTIGATOR_156443] (26). It is expect ed that there will be  a significantly greater 
mean increase in hypnotizability ratings with active rTMS than with the sham rTMS condition at 
the p<0.05, level.  
 
Secondary Objective C:  To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC 
on the neural network underlying the conflict regulation system as a reflection of effective 
modulation of the neural circuitry underlying hypnotizability.   
 
It has been demonstrated that h igh hypnotizables recruit the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) 
during conflict tasks while lows recruit the attentional network (32). Inhibitory rTMS has been 
demonstrated to not o nly modulate the hypnosis circuitry, but also change the manner in which 
the brain attends to stimuli (61).

 Hypnosis Scans for Secondary Outcome Measure C:  All participants will receive the same 
identical pre -rTMS Stroop task scan (32). After randomization (to either active DLPFC rTMS or 
sham rTMS ) where one half (n=45) will receive active DLPFC rTMS  (cTBS) , and one -half sham  
DLPFC  rTMS  (cTBS)  (n=45) (30), all participant s have their  post-rTMS  Stroop task scan 
session (32).  
 
fMRI Preprocessing and Analysis : All fMRI data will be preprocessed and analyzed using FSL 
(FMRIB Software Library, version 5.0) (88 ) and in the manner described in the Primary Outcome 
Measure. For group analysis , FMRIB’s local analysis of mixed effects will be used within a mask 
of our a priori ROIs  rIFG, DMN nodes, and attentional network nodes , thresholded  using family -
wise error (FWE) corrected Z>2.3; cluster p<0.05. Average contrast of parameter estimate values 
will be extracted from our ROIs and Spearman’s correlations will be calculated between these 
values and differences in  active versus sham rTMS . 
 
Secondary  Hypothesis  C: Active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will modulate the neural 
network that underlies conflict regulation  by [CONTACT_156523] ( rIFG) and the default mode 
network  (DMN ) as compared to sham rTMS (sham cTBS).  
 
Connectivity between rIFG and DMN  will be assessed  with BOLD and resting state functional 
connectivity MRI  at the baseline time-point  and as well as at the post -rTMS  time-point for both 
rTMS  conditions  (active and sham )(32). It is expect ed that the stimulation -induced fu nctional 
connectivity between these the rIFG and the DMN  would be increased compared to change in 
the connectivity in those receiving sham rTMS. It is hypothesize d that inhibitory rTMS  (cTBS)  to 
L-DLPFC will result in increased fc between the rIFG and the DMN  as well as increased activity 
in rIFG (32). 
Analyses  will be restricted  to the rIFG and the nodes of the DMN  for th is Secondary Outcome 
Measure (32). To determine if rTMS condition  during the hypnotic state  is specifically associated 
with change in rIFG and DMN  activity and functional connectivity , a mask restricted to rIFG and 
DMN  will be utilized  to extract the fMRI activity and connectivity  data(32). It is expect ed that  the 
correlation in active rTMS  group  over L-DLPFC to be stronger than the correlation obtained in the 
sham rTMS  group . Regression analysis will determine the strength of the relationship between 
the reductions of fMRI activity between dACC and L-DLPFC during the active versus sham rTMS 
conditions. Regression analysis will be used to investigate whether greater connectivity will be 
present between rIFG and DMN  for active rTMS versus sham rTMS.  
 
Secondary Objective D : To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS (cTBS) over L-DLPFC 
on the neural network underlying the post -hypnotic  suggestion  Stroop Effect.  
 
Post-hypnotic suggestion of word -blindness eliminates the Stroop effect in high 
hypnotizables (119) . High hypnotizables demonstrate reduced conflict signaling during the Stroop 
task after the post-hypnotic suggestion of word -blindness (35).

Hypnosis Scans for Secondary Outcome Measure D : All participants will receive the same 
identical pre -rTMS post-hypnotic suggestion Stroop task scan(35). After randomization  (to either 
active DLPFC rTMS or sham rTMS ) where one half (n=45) will receive active DLPFC rTMS  
(cTBS) , and one -half sham  DLPFC  rTMS  (cTBS)  (n=45) (30), all participant s have their  post-rTMS  
post-hypnotic suggestion Stroop task scan sessio n(35).  
 
fMRI Preprocessing and Analysis : All fMRI data will be preprocessed and analyzed using FSL 
(FMRIB Software Library, version 5.0)  and in the manner described in the Primary Outcome 
Measure.  For group analysis, FMRIB’s local analysis of mixed effects will be used  within a mask 
of our a priori ROIs ACC and DLPFC, thresholded using family -wise error (FWE) corrected Z>2.3; 
cluster p<0.05. Average contrast of parameter estimate values will be extracted from the ROIs 
and Spearman’s correlations will be calculated between these values and differences in  active 
versus sham rTMS . 
 
Secondary Hyp othesis D : Post-hypnotic instruction of word blindness after active, inhibitory 
rTMS (cTBS) over L -DLPFC will reduce dACC activity during the Stroop task (similar to high 
hypnot izables) as compared to sham rTMS (sham cTBS).  
 
Activity in  dACC will be assessed  with fMRI(35) at the baseline time-point  and as well as at the 
post-rTMS time -point for both rTMS  conditions  (active and sham ). Long -lasting (~1 hour) 
inhibitory rTMS  (spaced continuous theta -burst stimulation approach (30)) will be applied  to L-
DLPFC and expect that the stimulation -induced functional connectivity between these two nodes 
would be increased as a surrogate of increased hypnotizability and therefore increased post -
hypnotic Stroop Effect.  
 
Analyses will be restricted to the dACC  and DLPFC  for th is Secondary Outcome Measur e. To 
determine if rTMS condition  during the hypnotic state  is specifically associated with change in 
dACC and DLPFC activity , a mask restricted to dACC and DLPFC  will be utilized  to extract the 
fMRI activity . The correlation in active rTMS  group  over L-DLPFC is expected to be stronger than 
the correlation obtained in the sham rTMS  group . Regression analysis will determine the strength 
of the relationship between the reductions of fMRI activity between dACC and L-DLPFC with 
active versus sham rTMS  conditions.  
 
Secondary Outcome E : To determine the effect of active, inhibitory rTMS over DLPFC on  
modulating the neural network that underlies hypnotic analgesia.  
 
This aim explores if L-DLPFC rTMS  modulated increase in hypnotizability  will have downstream 
effects on the hypnotic analgesia modulation of  the rest of the hypnotic analgesia network (ACC, 
insula and/or the somatosensory cortex) by [CONTACT_156524]/deactivations induced 
by [CONTACT_156525].

Hypnosis Scans for Secondary Outcome Measure D:  The participants will have a baseline scan 
with baseline pain induction in the scanner. For this scanning session, task fMRI data  will be  
collected while pa rticipants  are randomized to receive and rate painful thermal  stimulations after 
either active rTMS  (cTBS) + hypnotic analgesia (HA)  or sham rTMS  + hypnotic analgesia . The 
differences in pain ratings and regional brain activity of the networks related to hypnotic analgesia 
(restricted to masks of the insula, somatosensory, L-DLPFC, and anterior cingulate cortices)  as 
well as analyzing the functional connectivity changes betw een dACC and the L-DLPFC , insula , 
somatosensory cortices as well as between L-DLPFC and the dACC , insula , and somatosensory 
cortices  will be analyzed . Given the relative mechanistic independence of these two putative 
interventions (rTMS and HA) (37, 68) , it is possible that  active rTMS would also directly affect  
analgesia , although unlikely given stimulation frequency . Certainly the downstream neural 
network effects of both interventions have overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_156444] -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_156445] (37, 68) . rTMS, however, has been demonstrated to reach what were 
previously thought to be non -connected regions of a given neural network in  a given condition or 
state (46). It is possible that rTMS alone may activate certain network nodes  in one state, but in a 
different mental state activate other network nodes (125) . This study strives  to determine if rTMS  
modulation of hypnotizability  can produce the downstream effect of  increas ing functional 
connectivity and decreas ing activation of anterior cingulate,  insular, and somatosensory cortices,  
which are  areas involved in  the HA network (37).  
 
fMRI Preprocessing and Analysis:  All fMRI data will be preprocessed and analyzed using FSL 
(FMRIB Software Library, version 5.0)  and in the manner described in the analysis description for 
the Primary Outcome Measure.  For group analysis, FMRIB’s local analysis of mixed effects will 
be used within a mask of our a priori ROIs  (L-DLPFC, dACC, insula, and somatosensory cortices ), 
thresholded using family -wise error (FWE) corrected Z>2.3; cluster p<0.05. Average contrast of 
parameter estimate values will be extracted from our ROIs an d Spearman’s correlations will be 
calculated between these values and differences in  active versus sham rTMS . 
 
Secondary Hypothesis E : Active, inhibitory rTMS  over DLPFC will modulate the neural network 
that underlies hypnotic analgesia by [CONTACT_133239] a decrease in activity and an increase functional 
connectivity among the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral, insular, and somatosensory cortices 
(hypnotic analgesia n etwork) as compared to sham rTMS.  
 
The neural network involved with HA (anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, insular, and 
somatosensory cortices) will be assessed at baseline (after pre -TMS hypnotic analgesia 
instruction)  hypnosis and after rTMS (again after hypnotic analgesia  instruction) . 
Activation/deactivation as well as connectivity between baseline and post-TMS  will be contrasted 
to determine if only the active rTMS condition results in greater reductions of activity within the 
network involve d in hypnotic analgesia (6, 37)  in comparison to sham rTMS . Changes in activity 
and connectivity between baseline scan and HA + active DLPFC rTMS and HA + sham rTMS 
conditions will be compared using ANOVA.  We expect a significantly greater mean decrease in 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  73 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 activity and increase in connectivity with the HA + active rTMS  conditions than the HA + sham  
rTMS  condition at the p<0.05, level.  
 
Analyses  will be restricted  to the anterior cingulate, L-DLPFC, insular, and somatosensory 
cortices. The correlation in the active  rTMS  + HA  condition  is expected  to be stronger than the 
correlation obtained in the sham rTMS  + HA . To determine if a given rTMS condition is specifically 
associated with HA induced change in that stimulated L-DLPFC activity, a mask restricted to 
dACC, DLPFC, insula and somatosensory cortex  will be utilized  to extract the fMRI activity data. 
Regression analysis will determine the strength of the relationship between the reductions of fMRI 
activity within the hypnotic analgesia network(4, 19) during the active versus sham rTMS 
conditions. Regression analysis will be used to investigate whether greater activity and 
connectivity will be present in the HA network (anterior cingulate, L-DLPFC, insular, and 
somatosensory cortices) for active rTMS -augmented hypnotic analgesia versus hypnotic 
analgesia alone (sham rTMS).  
 
Secondary Outcome Measure  F:   
 
F.1.To evaluate cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, 1H -MRS will be acquired to 
determine the concentrations of GABA and glutamate/glutamine (Glx).  
 
F.2. We will evaluate the associations between neurotransmitter levels and functional connectivity 
as well as behavioral measures of clinical pain level and duration.  
 
F.3. As an exploratory aim, we will acquire a broad spectra MRS scan to determine 
dysregulation in other neurometabolites, particularly myo -inositol - a marker of 
neuroinflammation linked to glial reactivity.  
Secondary Hypothesis F: L-DLPFC GABA levels will be negatively associated with clinical pain 
measures in participants with FMS.  
MRS  Analysis:  
GABA and Glx Spectra Analysis GABA and Glx  MRS will be analyzed using Gannet software 
implemented within MATLAB. Analysis will be conducted in two principal stages: 1) processing 
of raw time -domain data from the scanner into GABA -edited frequency -domain difference 
(DIFF) spectra with the following  steps – line broadening, zerofill, fast Fourier transform, and 
extraction of water frequency; 2) Spectra fitting to quantify the edited GABA signals. To perform 
GABA J -difference editing two acquisitions will be acquired differing in the manipulation of t he 
GABA spin system. Subsequent subtraction of the manipulated acquisitions will reveal GABA 
signals under the more prominent creatine (Cr) signal at [ADDRESS_181279] Guidelines and Considerations  74 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 to water in ins titutional units (i.u.). Glx ratio will be derived from LCModel version 6.3 -1 software 
using a simulated basis set, the jMRUI Amares algorim in a similar method descried by 
O’Gorman and colleagues [ 178]. Integration of the co -edited Glx signal at 3.75 ppm will carried 
out using a linear fit to the baseline and the sum of two Lorentzians to fit the doublet peak. A 
regression and/or correlation analysis will be used to determine the relationship between 
changes in connectivity, MRS and behavioral metrics (cli nical pain measures and 
hypnotizability). We will include regressors of non -interest for time between study visits, sex, 
and age.  
 
Secondary Outcome Measure  G:   
 
G.1. Using MRS, we will evaluate the L -DLPFC GABA concentrations before and after cTBS in 
a double -blinded sham -controlled design. The cartesian coordinate of the L -DLPFC cTBS target 
will be used for MRS voxel placement. As an internal control, right DLPFC MRS will be acquired 
for each subject to distinguish the laterality of the hypnosis effect.  
 
Aim G.2. We will test whether changes in functional connectivity and behavioral measures of 
hypnotizability and hypnotic analgesia are associated with alterations in GABA MRS 
concentration.  
Secondary Hypothesis G: cTBS neuromodulation of L -DLPFC -dACC con nectivity is mediated 
by [CONTACT_156513] -neuronal cortical pathways measured by [CONTACT_156514] L -DLPFC. 
Neuromodulation induced by [CONTACT_156515] L -DLPFC -dACC connectivity, but 
the neurochemistry underlying these changes is unknown.  
MRS  Analysis:  
MRS analysis will be conducted identical to the Secondary Outcome Measure F. A subtraction of 
metabolic concentrations between pre - and post -TMS sessions will be used for subsequent 
correlation between changes in hypnotic analgesia and clinical pa in measures. After completion 
of the study, unblinded data will be used to determine active versus sham changes in metabolic 
concentrations.  
 
 
9.7 Data Analyses   
 
The Primary Mechanistic O utcome Measure for this study is increased functional connectivity 
between  the L -DLPFC and dACC.  The Relevant Clinical Outcome Measure is change in hypnotic 
analgesia as measured by [CONTACT_156526].  For secondary aims, the emphasis is on 
identifying the magnitude of effects (clinical significance, effect size) i nstead of statistical 
significance. We will test whether the change in connectivity from baseline to post -treatment is 
greater in the active rTMS  group as  compared to the sham group. Following the convention in 
imaging studies, we will conduct our primary analyses treating  the contrast (baseline v ersus  post) 
as one univariate outcome .  We do not expect much variation across our narrowly defined 
subjects, although some variation is still possible. Given that, we will also analyze the data in the 
linear mixed  effects modeling framework  (165, 166)  allowing for random intercepts (although this 
is not customary in imaging studies)  as a way of sensitivity analysis. The same analytical strategy 
will be used to test the effect of rTMS on the DLPFC and dACC ac tivity, which is Secondary 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  75 of 99 Version 1. 3 
  14 MAR 2018  
 Hypot hesis A (previously activity portion of Hypothesis 1a -in grant), activity during conflict task 
(Secondary Hypothesis C), and during post -hypnotic instruction conflict task (Secondary 
Hypothesis D).  
We are using  thermal  pain stimuli percept -matched  to the individual  receiving the intervention . 
Examining the treatment -effect moderating the role of the pain level is not a primary aim of this 
project.  
 
Moderator /mediator  investigation:  We will explore various baseline variables as potential 
moderators of rTMS effect. For this investigation, we will employ the McArthur approach  (167, 
168) for moderator analysis.  We will also examine potential mediators of rTMS effect using the 
McArthur approach (167, 168)  as well as contemporary causal mediation approaches  (169-174), 
which we believe will provide valuable insights regarding the neuromodulation mechanism for the 
next phase of investigation.   
 
Handling of missing data:  We use the same sample twice  to achieve enough statistical  power with 
our moderate sample size, not to model  the change between scanning sessions. With no  
longitudinal components, the two groups (rTMS v ersus  sham) will be cross -sectionally co mpared 
in our primary aims. The impact of missing data due to attrition is minimal. Further, t ime between 
assessments is so narrow that the probability of having cases with missing data (dropout, attrition) 
is very low.  As a way of assessing the impact of  missing scan sessions, we will repeat our main 
analyses treating outcomes measured in the hypnosis scan and in the hypnotic analgesia scan 
as multivariate outcomes. This  will allow us to include all participants in the analysis as long as 
one of the two s cans is available. In this analysis framework,  missing data will be handled 
assuming that it is missing at random conditional on observed scan session data  (maximum 
likelihood estimation). Analyzing the data using both univariate and multivariate  analysis 
approaches will also serve as sensitivity analyses. Additionally, we will include the order of scan 
sessions in the model to account for the carryover and order effects .

 10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
 
10.1 Data Collection Forms   
 
 
Participants entering the study will be assigned a unique and random participant ID. All research 
material will be identified by [CONTACT_79166], which will be unrelated to the participant’s identity. There 
will be a locked file that links the ID number to ident ity, but only the PI s will have access. Research 
staff analyzing the data will only have ID numbers to use.  Written records will be kept confidential, 
locked in file cabinets in private offices in our research laboratory. The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_156446], completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data 
reported.  All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate 
interpretation of data.  The investigators will maintain adequate case histories of study subjects, 
including accurate case report forms (CRFs), and source documentation.  Data collection and 
accurate documentation are the responsibility of the study staff under the supervision of the 
Principal Investigator .  All source docume nts and laboratory reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_98529], which  will ensure that they are accurate and complete.  Unanticipated 
problems and adverse events will be  reviewed by [CONTACT_079] s. 
 
 
10.2 Data Management   
 
 
The study staff will enter data from the CRFs into an electronic data capture (EDC) system that 
is compliant with 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 11 FDA (Food and Drug 
Administration) requirements. Edit checks, electronic queries, and audit trail s are built into the 
system to ensure accurate and complete data collection and security. Details of the study 
stimulation sessions  including stimulation  parameters, such as motor threshold measurements 
(MT) for each subject, will be retained within the TM S device  and REDCAP system . In addition, 
a printed report of the scan sessions  will be stored as part of the subject’s source documents. 
Details from the study sessions  will be entered into EDC. Case files will be created for each 
subject where completed C RFs will be stored.  
 
The database will be centralized on a dedicated file server located on a secure rack in the Stanford 
University Forsythe Hall data center. The data center is maintained by [CONTACT_156527], 24/ 7 monitoring, environmental control systems, fire 
detection and suppression, and an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) for protection against 
power anomalies. A Backup and Recovery Service (BaRS) is available. The file server is only 
accessible through the  Stanford University network (SUNET), however off campus access to the 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_181280] Virtual Private Network (VPN) service. This file server  has been utilized  in the past 
to store databases for previous studies and have also use the VPN service without incident.  All 
raw data forms received will be promptly stamped, entered or scanned, and filed in a locked filing 
cabinet. No information will be released to persons o ther than the patient without permission. 
Confidentiality is assured. Results of all studies are published in a manner that does not reveal 
the identity of individual subjects.  
 
 
Database and Web servers will be secured through controlled physical access. For security 
reasons, and in compliance with regulatory guidelines, EDC system access is granted to the user 
who owns the sign on identification and password in use. Access codes are non -transferrable. 
Personnel who have not undergone training will not access the study eCRF’s until appropriate 
training is completed and documented. The eCRF data elements do not reside on the users 
workstation ; they are transmitted to a secure databa se as forms are completed or updated. 
Protocol -specified source documents (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], operative/procedural 
reports) will be retrieved as necessary. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_120882] -related documentation will be retained 
within the central labora tory. Case files will be located in a secured area at each study site. All 
completed CRFs will be de -identified and subjects will be referred to using only their assigned 
study subject identifier and initials. Information stored in the source documents wil l be 
safeguarded  according to institutional guidelines.  
 
 
Access to the database would be restricted and only the database manager can alter the complete 
database. The research assistants will be able to modify parts of the database to enter data or 
make n ecessary corrections to the data. Access to specific parts of the database can be granted 
to other project members with permission obtained through the Principal Investigator. All 
personnel will be required to successfully complete HIPAA training. Access t o the database on 
the file server is monitored and controlled through SUNET and separate SUNET IDs and 
passwords are required. Secure email alternatives will be used to safely communicate information 
or send data between project members. Stanford IT Servic es provides a Secure Email service, 
which is very easy and seamless to use. To achieve email encryption, only the word “SECURE:” 
needs to be added to the subject line in an email message. Stanford School of Medicine 
Information . Resources and Technology (I RT) group also provides MedSecureSend (MSS) 
service for large files up to 20GB. Secure Email is only available to project member and 
collaborators with SUNET IDs. For collaborators outside of campus, a MedSecureSend email 
message can include an option to i nvite a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_156447] a MedSecure account before the 
content of the email can be opened or read.

 10.3 Quality Assurance  
  
10.3.1  Training  
 
Staff trainin g: 
 
 rTMS Training:  Every TMS operator on this study will be trained in a basic knowledge of 
brain physiology, of basic mechanisms of TMS, of the potential risks of the rTMS 
procedure, of the ph ysiological changes induced  by [CONTACT_112016]  (99). Nolan Williams ( PI) or a 
certified TMS technician will train all TMS operators and provide a letter for completion of 
training. Training will also include the ability and certification to deal with potential acute 
complications of TMS. This training will be uploaded into REDC AP database. In order to 
operate the rTMS device, the operator must have a verified rTMS training completion form 
loaded into REDCAP.  
 
 Thermode Training : All thermode  operators will be trained on the safe use of the Medoc 
Pathway Model ATS and its computer  software  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Yeomans  or a certified Medoc 
technician . They will receive a letter certifying completion for safety training. This training 
will be uploaded into REDCAP datab ase. In order to operate the thermode  device, the 
operator must have a completed thermode safety  completion form loaded into  REDCAP.  
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_181281] consistency checks programmed into the system to inform the 
investigators of potential data issues as the data entry progresses. The exception log for entries 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_3433] e IMC to identify potential training and/or data integrity issues. NCCIH will 
perform site monitoring, including review of the CRFs wit h verification to the source 
documentation to verify accuracy of CRF data. During monitoring visits, the study staff  will make 
their computer and/or high-speed  internet access available to the NCCIH study monitor so that 
he or she may verify the data entri es with the source documentation as needed. If data integrity 
issues are suspected , they will be reported to the NCCIH immediately.  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_181282] IRB.  
 
 
A protocol deviation that constitutes an unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or to 
others  will be reported promptly to  the IRB, as follows:  
 
1. Emergency deviations:   When a deviation occurs in an emergency situation, such as when a 
departure from the protocol is required to protect the life or physical well being  of a participant.  
The NCCIH  and Stanford  IRB will be notified as soon as possible  and no later than [ADDRESS_181283] IRB in eIRB under 
the Further Study Action activity, and use the Problem/Event Report.  
 
2. Major, non -emergent deviations without prior approval:   A planned deviation that is non -
emergent and represents a major change in the protocol as approved by [CONTACT_55790].  The 
Stanford IRB must approve the request before the proposed change is implemented.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_156448] -emergent deviations to the IRB for review in eIRB under the Further Study Action  
activity, and use the Change in Research  activity.  If a major, non -emergent deviation occurs 
without prior IRB approval the event is considered non -compliance.  Non -compliance will be 
reported to the IRB promptly, in eIRB under the Further Study Action activity, and use the 
Problem/Event Report .  The PI’s failure to report promptly any major, non -emergent deviation for 
which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_11646] -compliance.  
 
Protocol deviations that are only minor or administrative:  At Stanford, minor or administrative 
protocol deviations are defined as those, which do not affect the scientific soundness of the 
research plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of human subjects .  If a protocol deviation occurs 
which meets this definition, the deviation will be reported to the Stanford IRB at the time the 
continuing review application is submitted. Examples of minor or administrative deviations  could 
include:  follow up visits that occurred outside the protocol required time frame because of the 
participant’s schedule, or blood samples obtained at times close to but not precisely at the time 
points specified in the protocol.

 10.3.5  Monitoring  
 
An Independent Monitoring Committee (IMC)  will be assembled to oversee the safety of the study, 
subjects, and the scientific validity and integrity of data collected as part of the study. This IMC 
will include members from Stanford  and will consist of on e non -study, board -certified psychiatrist , 
one pain expert,  and one biostatistician.  The responsibilities and decision points for the IMC will 
be captured in the IMC charter.  The IMC has oversight for the overall safety of the study. This 
safety monitoring  will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as 
noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a data and safety -monitoring plan. 
Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of  serious adverse 
events.   
 
Following written standard operating procedures, the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is 
conducted and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the 
protocol, Good Clinical Practice ( GCP), and the applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
investigational site will provide direct access source data/ documents, and reports for the purpose 
of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_156490] , and inspection by [CONTACT_3482].  
Quality control procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data 
quality control checks that will be run on the database will be generated.  Any missing data or 
data anomalies will be communicated to the IMC for clarification/re solution.  
 
Ongoing quality control will include regular data verification and protocol compliance checks to be 
performed by [CONTACT_978] (Nolan Williams, MD) and his research team. An ongoing review of study 
procedures will be done to ensure that the privacy of participants and confidentiality of data is not 
violated. There will also be adequate provisions for monitoring the collected data to ensure the 
safety of participants and to maintain the confidentiality of the research data. This second CRC 
will be respon sible for addressing quality assurance issues (correcting procedures that are not in 
compliance with protocol) and quality control issues (correcting errors in data entry).  
 
Source data comprise all information, original records of clinical findings, obser vations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data 
are contained in source documents. Examples of these original documents and data records 
include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and offi ce charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries 
or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], 
microfiches, ph otographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved 
in the clinical trial. When applicable, information recorded on the CRF shall matc h the source data 
recorded on the source documents.

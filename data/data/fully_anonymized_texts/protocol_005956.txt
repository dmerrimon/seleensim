    STUDY PROTOCOL  [ADDRESS_639254] the Efficacy of Mitoquinone/Mitoquinol Mesylate to 6 Prevent Severe Viral Illness      7 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 8 April 1 2022 9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20 Principal Investigator:  [ADDRESS_639255] viral infections including RSV and SARS-CoV-2 in adults. Given extensive 7 published data regarding safety of mito-MES in humans (presented herein) and urgent need to 8 develop novel oral antiviral agents, we believe that an open label exploratory safety and efficacy 9 study will obtain proof of concept data whether mito-MES has antiviral activity in humans. This is 10 a feasibility study to determine the safety and efficacy of the treatment with mito-MES 20 mg 11 daily for up to 14 days to prevent development of severe clinical symptoms of any viral infection 12 in high-risk close household contacts of cases with viral infection. Primary efficacy measures will 13 be development of viral illness (YES/NO) throughout the study period. Secondary endpoints will 14 be new onset fever (T> 100.3 F or 38C), duration of ANY of at least three respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]/systemic [ADDRESS_639256] the safety and efficacy of 9 mitoquinone/mitoquinol mesylate as prophylaxis for development of severe viral illness 10  11 Investigators/Study Center: [ADDRESS_639257] 4  5 UCLA OHRP https://ohrpp.research.ucla.edu/ [ADDRESS_639258] Los Angeles, CA [ZIP_CODE] Campus Mail Code: 140648 7  8 3.4.  Phase of Development 9 Phase I/II efficacy and safety trial  10  11 3.5.  Objectives:   12  13 We propose the use of Mito-MES as drug (FDA IND status) as a novel therapy for viral [ADDRESS_639259], we will focus on the design of an open label phase I/II [ADDRESS_639260] the safety and efficacy of Mito-MES to prevent the development and 17 progression of viral infections including RSV and SARS-CoV-2 after high-risk exposure to a 18 person with suspected viral infection (post exposure prophylaxis study). We focus on post 19 exposure prophylaxis study in adults (see study design) and not acute treatment study, since a [ADDRESS_639261] exposure prophylaxis study design may require a much smaller sample size to show 21 efficacy and may be more feasible with current resources compared to an acute treatment 22 study. 23  24 
Primary objectives: 1  2 • To determine the efficacy of the treatment with mito-MES 20 mg daily for up to 14 days to 3 prevent development of any viral infection (Yes/no) in high-risk close household contacts of 4 cases with viral infection  5 • To determine the efficacy of the treatment with mito-MES [ADDRESS_639262] two new onset independent symptoms or signs (fever) of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] 12 disease that cannot be attributed to bacterial cause. For example, the combination of coryza 13 (runny nose) and sore throat is very characteristic of a viral illness since there is no bacterial 14 “rhinitis”. The combination of fever and cough is not specific enough presentation since it can be [ADDRESS_639263] chronic runny 17 nose or headache or cough.  18  19 Primary measures of efficacy (will be assessed in ALL the study participants): 20  21 The following primary outcomes are based on criteria that can be obtained reliably and 22 consistently for all the study participants (based on history and thermometer).  23  24 • Development of any symptom of viral infection within 14 days after exposure (YES/No). 25 
• Severity of viral illness based on a quantitative score system. Each of the above 14 1 symptoms will be given a score based on severity: 1 for mild, 2 for moderate, 3 for severe. 2 Then a total severity score will be estimated (range of score is 0-42). Common example: a 3 person with mild coryza, sore throat and cough will be given a score of 3. 4  5  6 Secondary measures of efficacy (will be assessed in study participants but some endpoints 7 such as diagnostic tests may not be available in all the study participants): 8  9 The following secondary outcomes are based on either non quantitative criteria (categorical) 10 or criteria that may not be available for all the study participants (for example FDA approved 11 diagnostic tests).  The study will not pay for any diagnostic tests. These diagnostic tests for 12 viruses may be available in the setting of real world setting and clinical care of each participant 13 (for example if performed by [CONTACT_497169] a doctor in the setting of clinical care).  14  15 • Development of new onset fever (T> 100.3 F or 38C) based on documented 16 measurements of temperature on a daily basis throughout the duration of the study. 17 Temperature will be recorded in a diary and recording temperature would be a requirement 18 for study participation.  19 • Duration of ANY of at least three respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]/systemic symptom of viral illness in days 20 (Symptom 1: fever, Symptom 2: cough, Symptom 3: coryza, Symptom 4: sore throat, 21 Symptom 5: shortness of breath, Symptom 6:  chills, Symptom 7: fatigue, Symptom 8: loss 22 of smell or taste, Symptom 9: myalgias, Symptom 10: arthralgias, Symptom 11: headache, 23 Symptom 12: nausea, Symptom 13: vomiting, Symptom 14: diarrhea 24 
• Confirmation of viral infection based on a FDA approved diagnostic test (for example [ADDRESS_639264] for SARS-CoV-2, PCR for SARS-CoV-2).  3 • Symptomatic viral infection: proportion of participants with fever, cough, or other 4 respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]/systemic symptoms (including but not limited to fatigue, loss of smell or taste, 5 myalgias, arthralgias, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, chills, coryza, nausea, 6 vomiting, diarrhea). 7 • Symptomatic moderate to severe viral infection. Based on established score system a viral [ADDRESS_639265] 2 different 9 symptoms as “moderate” or “severe”.  10 • Symptomatic PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 11 • Need for oxygen therapy (days) 12 • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497158]: The median number of 13 days (or partial days) spent admitted to an acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  14 • Respi[INVESTIGATOR_497159]: The median 15 number of days (or partial days) requiring (i) non-invasive or (ii) invasive ventilation 16 • Mortality (proportion of participants who die) attributable to viral disease and all-cause 17 mortality  18  19  20 Outcome measures:  21 Adverse events (day 7, 14): the proportion of participants exhibiting adverse events of 22 any grade as defined using the established87 grading scales for the severity of adverse 23 event, such as the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 24 
Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials 1 https://www.fda.gov/media/[ZIP_CODE]/download). 2  3 Design of Study:   4  5 Overview of study design 6 Open label clinical trial (intervention with a diet supplement) to evaluate the safety and efficacy 7 of treatment with mitoquinone/mitoquinol mesylate (mito-MES) (20 mg daily) daily to prevent [ADDRESS_639266] Selection Criteria (Exclusion and Inclusion):   [ADDRESS_639267] meet the following criteria: 15 1. Age 18-65 years old. Rationale: We will recruit 18-[ADDRESS_639268] document safety in the setting of viral infection in 19 the absence of established kidney, liver and heart disease and other major morbidity.       20 2. Asymptomatic (no symptoms of viral infection) on study entry.  [ADDRESS_639269] two new onset independent symptoms or signs (fever) of [ADDRESS_639270] two new onset independent 1 symptoms or signs (fever) of respi[INVESTIGATOR_497160]. 2 For example, the combination of coryza (runny nose) and sore throat is very characteristic of 3 a viral illness since there is no bacterial “rhinitis”. The combination of fever and cough is not [ADDRESS_639271] chronic runny nose or headache or cough. 7 4. High risk exposure without use of masks to suspected case of viral infection (based 8 on history and the study definition in the household within 5 days prior to study entry. High-9 risk exposure was defined as prolonged (>24 hour) and intimate (< 6 feet) exposure to index 10 case without personal protective equipment (e.g., face mask) in poorly ventilated indoor 11 areas. To increase chances that differences in treatment efficacy between the compared 12 groups will be shown will as small sample size as possible, the study team enrolled 13 participants with particularly high risk exposure to the index case defined as: a) direct care 14 for the index case; b) had close direct physical contact [CONTACT_497170]; c) lived with the 15 index case; d) had close indoor contact (within 6 feet), with or without direct physical [ADDRESS_639272] 24 hours; e) had direct contact [CONTACT_497171], including oral 17 secretions, respi[INVESTIGATOR_171919], or stool. For example, we included several parents that 18 were exposed to infected children (who also infected their siblings) and included an [ADDRESS_639273] with children during childcare and while the children were symptomatic 22 (fever, cough, coryza, fatigue);  [ADDRESS_639274] results. To minimize 24 false negative tests, we included participants who had multiple independent SARS-CoV-2 25 diagnostic tests with sensitivity >90% per test;  26 
6. Adequate renal function determined by [CONTACT_16424]-Gault formula for creatinine clearance 1 (>60 mL/min/1.73 m2  2 7. Able and willing to communicate in English 3 8. Able and willing to provide informed consent to take part in the study 4 9. Able and willing to provide medical/surgical history [ADDRESS_639275] follow up for all study visits, barring unforeseen circumstances 6  7 In addition, for the mito-MES group, the following inclusion criteria were applied:  [ADDRESS_639276] 1–4 days prior to study entry. This 12 4-day window would also allow for up to 24-hour period for initiation of intervention (mito-13 MES) so that mito-MES would be started within 5 days since exposure to index case;  [ADDRESS_639277] efficacy when given as soon as possible (ideally 22 within 48 hours). This design with immediate initiation of Mito-MES within [ADDRESS_639278] 23 exposure is different than the study design in a randomized controlled Phase 2/3 EPIC-PEP 24 (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-[ADDRESS_639279]-Exposure Prophylaxis) of paxlovid [ADDRESS_639280] exposure from SARS-CoV-2 that failed to demonstrate therapeutic 26 
efficacy (unpublished data). Time of initiation of the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) 1 treatment is critical in the setting of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that may establish 2 infection in less than 5 days.  3 3. Ineligible for FDA approved alternative treatments to prevent progression to severe viral 4 infection including COVID-19 based on established criteria 5 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-6 conditions.html. Rationale: If the study participant has confirmed exposure to SARS-CoV-2, 7 the participant will be allowed to enroll only if he/she is eligible for other FDA approved 8 treatments such as monoclonal antibodies or other antivirals for reasons such as personal 9 choice, allergies or lack of availability.   10 11. Willing to follow sexual abstinence during study period or highly effective method of 11 contraception. Rationale: Since the study drug (mito-MES) has not been studied in pregnant 12 women, women and men of child bearing potential should use a barrier method that 13 prevents pregnancy in combination with a highly effective method of contraception.  Highly 14 effective methods are: 15 • oral contraceptive   16 • Use of condoms during any sexual intercourse during the study period 17 • intrauterine device 18 • intrauterine hormonal releasing systems 19 • Bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion 20 • Vasectomized partner provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the participant and [ADDRESS_639281] (can delay initiation of treatment for at [ADDRESS_639282] 24-48 hours). If a participant has a positive SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_639283] will set the foundation for future studies of use of 7 mito-MES as treatment for acute COVID-19.   8  9 Exclusion criteria for all study participants: 10 Participants who meet any of the following criteria at screening will be excluded from the study: 11 1. Use of Coenzyme Q10 or Vitamin E < [ADDRESS_639284] immune 13 function and (transgender, pregnant, breastfeeding) 14 3. Pregnant (based on history) or lactating. If the possible study participant is female and 15 sexually active and there is a possibility based on history (timing of most recent sexual 16 intercourse and timing of menstrual period) that the possible study participant is pregnant, 17 then the participant will be excluded from the study. Rationale: Additional pregnancy testing 18 will further delay the initiation of treatment and will further compromise feasibility of the study 19 given limited resources.  20 4. Absence of significant clinical disease  clinical diseases [e.g., cardiovascular disease (such 21 as coronary artery/vascular disease, stroke), heart disease (such as congestive heart failure, 22 cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation), lung disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary 23 disease, asthma, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, pleural effusions), kidney disease 24 (glomerular filtration rate or GFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2), liver  disease (such as 25 cirrhosis, hepatitis), cancer, major immunosuppression (such as history of transplantation, 26 
HIV infection)] based on history. Rationale: Significant clinical diseases can confound 1 interpretation of results for safety and efficacy (e.g., symptomatic viral infection). For 2 example, a patient with known major lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary 3 disease (COPD) or heart disease may have chronic cough and shortness of breath at [ADDRESS_639285] approvals. In-person participant follow-up will not be conducted to facilitate 11 social distancing strategies and reduce risks of exposure to study personnel. Thus, physical 12 exam, blood and urine chemistries will not be performed to independently confirm the 13 absence of significant clinical diseases. 14 5. History of known gastrointestinal disease (such as gastroparesis) that may predispose 15 patients to nausea 16 6. History of auto-immune diseases 17 7. Chronic viral hepatitis 18 8. HIV infection or other chronic viral infection (e.g. HTLV).  19 9. Use of systemic immunomodulatory medications (e.g. steroids) within 4 weeks of enrollment 20 10. Any participant who has received any investigational drug within 30 days of dosing 21 11. History of underlying cardiac arrhythmia 22 12. History of severe recent cardiac or pulmonary event 23 13. A history of a hypersensitivity reaction to any components of the study drug or structurally 24 similar compounds including Coenzyme Q10 and idebenone 25 14. Unable to swallow tablets  26 
15. Use of any investigational products within 4 weeks of enrollment 1 16. Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would 2 make the patient unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the study requirements. 3 Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, current or recent history of severe, 4 progressive, or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, 5 pulmonary, neurological, or cerebral disease 6  7  8 Treatments 9   10  Mito-MES (called “MitoQ” and provided by [CONTACT_497172]) is commercially available as 5 mg 11 capsules. Thus, a dose of 5 mg would require 1 capsule and a dose of 20 mg would require 4 12 capsules.  13 Intervention in adults: Exposure of a potential study participant to a viral infection (whether it [ADDRESS_639286] or not) in a close contact [INVESTIGATOR_422469] 15 household of the study participant and which may cause severe disease in humans (such as 16 SARS-CoV-2 infection or influenza). Intervention would be 20 mg (4 drug capsules) PO daily [ADDRESS_639287] exposure and taken daily for up to 14 days. 18  19 Dose Justification 20  21 Dose justification    22 In a randomized controlled clinical trial of patients with Hepatitis C (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 23 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) mito-MES 40 mg orally daily had anti-inflammatory activity (reduced hepatitis) in 24 
an epi[INVESTIGATOR_255125] (liver). Mito-MES is commercially available as a dietary supplement in dose 1 of 10 mg orally daily. The dose of mito-MES that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_497161] 2 20 mg orally daily. It is likely that a higher dose (40 mg daily) is more effective against SARS-3 CoV-2 infection (better antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects) than the lower dose (20 mg daily). [ADDRESS_639288] the tolerability and efficacy of the 20 mg 5 dose of mito-MES that can be well tolerated in humans over a period of 14 days (20 mg PO 6 daily). The [ADDRESS_639289] higher incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.  8  9 Justification of 20 mg dose for penetration in respi[INVESTIGATOR_276910].  10  11 Oral MitoQ can achieve adequate levels in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_497162] 12 of early SARS-CoV-2 infection   13 One important consideration is whether oral MitoQ can achieve adequate tissue levels in 14 the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_497163]-CoV-2 infection.  MitoQ is the 15 only mitochondria-targeted antioxidant compound currently approved for human use that can 16 safely be delivered long-term to humans as oral formulation23 and has been used in clinical trials 17 for oxidative damage-related states such as liver disease24, Parkinson disease, vascular and 18 physiological function in older adults (www.clinicaltrials.gov)25,26. MitoQ is a reasonably 19 bioavailable form of the naturally-occurring antioxidant ubiquinone/coenzyme Q10 conjugated to 20 a lipophilic cation (triphenylphosphonium [TPP])28,29. CoQ10 is one of the mitochondrial [ADDRESS_639290] proven largely unsuccessful for prevention and/or treatment of human [ADDRESS_639291] short half-lives66,67 and do not penetrate well into the cells (to 25 
reach the cellular sources of ROS at concentrations that reduce or prevent their adverse 1 effects), the lipophilicity and positive charge of the TPP cation help drive MitoQ to the inner 2 mitochondrial membrane, where it accumulates at levels 100-1,000-fold higher than in the 3 cytosol of cells. This optimally positions MitoQ to reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress.  4 In mice, MitoQ accumulates in tissues including mitochondria-enriched epi[INVESTIGATOR_27771] 5 like liver and kidney at 50-700 pmol/g (wet weight) following ≥10 days of oral MitoQ 6 supplementation35. Pharmacokinetic analysis of orally administered alkyltriphenylphosphonium 7 cations in mice determined that a single oral dose produces levels of ~2.5-7.5 nmol/g wet 8 epi[INVESTIGATOR_255125] (kidney or liver)35. Importantly the upper airway respi[INVESTIGATOR_125752], the point [ADDRESS_639292] been determined (like kidney and liver). Although levels of MitoQ in respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] [ADDRESS_639293] 4 h data of about 14 h69. In a rat tissue distribution study, 18 mitoquinone was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_103008], with a brain: plasma ratio of 1:[ADDRESS_639294] 3 times lower than 20 epi[INVESTIGATOR_27771] (kidney and liver) 35, the plasma levels of MitoQ in vivo may partially reflect [ADDRESS_639295] retention of mitoquinone in the mitochondrial phospholipid 9 membranes.  10 In humans, a single 80 mg oral dose of MitoQ results in a maximal plasma concentration 11 of 33 ng/mL ~1 hour after administration29, similar to therapeutic levels of statins82,83. A single 40 12 mg oral dose of MitoQ resulted in plasma concentration of 2 ng/ml after [ADDRESS_639296] 3 times higher than plasma levels (based on 14 animal data), a concentration of MitoQ at the nM level can be achieved with a single dose of 15 MitoQ. Chronic supplementation of MitoQ at 40 or 80 mg/day results in an average elevation of 16 fasting plasma MitoQ concentrations of ~5 ng/mL after ~[ADDRESS_639297] not been studied at the tissue level84. However, oral administration of 21 CoQ10 in eight patients with COPD at 90 mg/day for 8 weeks improved oxygenation85, 22 suggesting adequate penetration in the lung tissue. Doses as high as 230 mg/kg/day are non-23 mutagenic and non-toxic in mice29,71. Using the FDA recommended surface area conversion 24 factor72,73, this is equivalent to a dose of ~1,119 mg/day for an average 60 kg human. This dose 25 
is several magnitudes (~60-fold) higher than the dose use in the current study (20 mg/day). [ADDRESS_639298] demonstrated that 2 MitoQ can be administered to humans for up to a year at doses of 40 and 80 mg/day without [ADDRESS_639299] attrition due to GI discomfort 4 (<5%) was observed with a 40 mg/day dose across two clinical trials25,26. A dose of [ADDRESS_639300] SARS-Co-V-2 to maximize absorption and minimize any potential gastrointestinal 7 symptoms25,29.  This dose was also used in a recent clinical trial with MitoQ vs placebo 8 supplementation in healthy, late middle aged older adults27. 9 In summary, the above published evidence suggests that a single oral dose of MitoQ (20 10 mg daily) can achieve adequate levels (in the range of at least nM) in the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] [ADDRESS_639301] SARS-CoV-2 will be more efficacious when taken early (< [ADDRESS_639302] exposure)86.   17  18 Duration of treatment justification    19 The duration of treatment for postexposure prophylaxis will be 14 days. We will use the 20 maximum possible duration of treatment for postexposure prophylaxis so that if we find lack of 21 efficacy in this clinical trial this can be attributed to lack of therapeutic efficacy of the antiviral 22 and not due to suboptimal duration of treatment. 23  24 
 Main Parameters of Safety 1  2 Adverse events (day 7, 14): the proportion of participants exhibiting adverse events of 3 any grade as defined using the established87 grading scales for the severity of adverse 4 event, such as the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 5 Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials 6 https://www.fda.gov/media/[ZIP_CODE]/download). 7  8 Main Parameters of Efficacy 9    10 Primary measures of efficacy (will be assessed in ALL the study participants): 11  12 The following primary outcomes are based on criteria that can be obtained reliably and 13 consistently for all the study participants (based on history and thermometer).  14  15 • Development of any symptom of viral infection within 14 days after exposure (YES/No). 16 • Severity of viral illness based on a quantitative score system. Each of the above 14 17 symptoms will be given a score based on severity: 1 for mild, 2 for moderate, 3 for severe. 18 Then a total severity score will be estimated (range of score is 0-42). Common example: a 19 person with mild coryza, sore throat and cough will be given a score of 3. 20  21  22 Secondary measures of efficacy (will be assessed in study participants but some endpoints 23 such as diagnostic tests may not be available in all the study participants): 24  25 
The following secondary outcomes are based on either non quantitative criteria (categorical) 1 or criteria that may not be available for all the study participants (for example FDA approved 2 diagnostic tests).  The study will not pay for any diagnostic tests. These diagnostic tests for 3 viruses may be available in the setting of real world setting and clinical care of each participant 4 (for example if performed by [CONTACT_497169] a doctor in the setting of clinical care).  5  6 • Development of new onset fever (T> 100.3 F or 38C) based on documented 7 measurements of temperature on a daily basis throughout the duration of the study. 8 Temperature will be recorded in a diary and recording temperature would be a requirement 9 for study participation.  10 • Duration of ANY of at least three respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]/systemic symptom of viral illness in days 11 (Symptom 1: fever, Symptom 2: cough, Symptom 3: coryza, Symptom 4: sore throat, 12 Symptom 5: shortness of breath, Symptom 6:  chills, Symptom 7: fatigue, Symptom 8: loss 13 of smell or taste, Symptom 9: myalgias, Symptom 10: arthralgias, Symptom 11: headache, 14 Symptom 12: nausea, Symptom 13: vomiting, Symptom 14: diarrhea 15 • Confirmation of viral infection based on a FDA approved diagnostic test (for example [ADDRESS_639303] for SARS-CoV-2, PCR for SARS-CoV-2).  18 • Symptomatic viral infection: proportion of participants with fever, cough, or other 19 respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]/systemic symptoms (including but not limited to fatigue, loss of smell or taste, 20 myalgias, arthralgias, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, chills, coryza, nausea, 21 vomiting, diarrhea). 22 • Symptomatic moderate to severe viral infection. Based on established score system a viral [ADDRESS_639304] 2 different 24 symptoms as “moderate” or “severe”.  25 
• Symptomatic PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 1 • Need for oxygen therapy (days) 2 • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497158]: The median number of 3 days (or partial days) spent admitted to an acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  4 • Respi[INVESTIGATOR_497159]: The median 5 number of days (or partial days) requiring (i) non-invasive or (ii) invasive ventilation 6 • Mortality (proportion of participants who die) attributable to viral disease and all-cause 7 mortality  8  9 3.12 Experimental protocol of study 10  11 Recruitment: [ADDRESS_639305] tracing to define a ring of exposed contacts around those 6 index cases.  7 Participant screening, informed consent, and follow-up will be internet- or telephone- based 8 with appropriate regulatory approvals. In-person participant follow-up will not be conducted to 9 reduce risks of exposure to study personnel and to ensure feasibility. Thus, physical exam, 10 blood and urine chemistries will not be performed to confirm eligibility. 11  12 Special classes or vulnerable populations:  13  14 No special classes of participants or vulnerable populations (children under the age of 18, 15 pregnant women, institutionalized individuals, etc) will be included in this research. In general, [ADDRESS_639306] large households. Every effort will be made to encourage the participation of women. 23 Women with variations in physiological functions due to hormones (transgender, breastfeeding,) 24 will be excluded from this study. Women who are pregnant or it is possible based on history that 25 
they will become pregnant will not be included due to unknown safety of the mitochondrial 1 antioxidant MitoQ in pregnant women. No potential research participant will be excluded based 2 on race/ethnicity.  [ADDRESS_639307], and 6 although study flyers will not target specific racial/ethnic populations, they will be distributed 7 across all available local areas. We will recruit participants with representation across a wide 8 range of age groups with both genders and major race/ethnicities included.  [ADDRESS_639308]. 15  16 Retention: [ADDRESS_639309] questions/concerns will be addressed in detail [ADDRESS_639310] with the investigator (e.g., telephone calls, texts, and emails to the patient and close 2 contacts; vital records search). The study will be conducted through the phone which is easily [ADDRESS_639311] in 9 participating in research, leading to high rates of retention of study subjects, with high level of 10 retention of volunteers in clinical studies even without the need for financial incentives. 11  12 Assessment of symptom severity of viral infection (including COVID-19( 13  14 Assessment of symptom severity of viral infection including COVID-19 will be performed based 15 on the FDA guidance on Assessing COVID-19-Related Symptoms in Outpatient Adult and 16 Adolescent Subjects in Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biological Products for COVID-1991. Patient-17 reported outcome (PRO) instruments will be used to assess COVID-19-related symptoms91.  [ADDRESS_639312] every 24 hours and will 19 be conducted at the same time each day. Electronic data collection systems will be used with 20 reminders to trial subjects to complete the PRO instrument to minimize missing data and 21 provide time stamps of completion. Alternatively, if a paper-based diary is used, the study team 22 will send reminders (e.g., phone calls, text messages, email) to trial subjects91. A set of common 23 viral-related symptoms (see Table 1) will be included in the daily PRO assessments of all trial [ADDRESS_639313] had at baseline, as new symptoms may 25 appear following the baseline assessment.  Each symptom will be scored individually using the 26 
following response options and scoring values. The score values will not be included within the 1 response options presented to trial subjects to avoid confusing subjects. Response scales 2 include verbal descriptors (e.g., none, mild, moderate, severe) because the absence of verbal 3 descriptors may create difficulty in interpretation in this context of use. Accordingly, use of 4 response scales such as visual analogue scales and 0–[ADDRESS_639314] 6 an evaluation to ensure the PRO instrument’s basic comprehensibility and usability before 7 implementation in a trial to mitigate risk of poor instrument performance. Efficacy endpoint 8 based on COVID-19 symptom severity will be the time to sustained clinical recovery assessed 9 over an appropriate duration. Sustained clinical recovery will be defined as occurring when no 10 key COVID-19-related symptom scored higher than a prespecified threshold over a clinically 11 meaningful time period (as documented using a PRO instrument).

Study-related documents and information collected from study participants will be 3 stored in locked file cabinets in areas with access limited to study staff and/or on a private [ADDRESS_639332]-protected access 7 systems. No participant’s study information will be released without the written permission of the 8 participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_100432]/or its contractors, UCLA IRB, or [ADDRESS_639333] Risks 14  15 Overview: The potential general risks of the proposed study also will be minimized by:  16 • allowing only healthy (free from chronic disease) men and women to participate; 17 • screening for adverse events and allergies to drugs; 18 • using only safe, well-established procedures with only qualified and experienced 19 personnel performing the procedures; 20 • ensuring constant personal monitoring of each experimental session by [CONTACT_473] 21 and staff; 22 • employing record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_497164]; 23 • keepi[INVESTIGATOR_497165], locked facilities on the campus; 24 • not associating individual subject data with subject name (all stored data will be coded).

Women who are not pregnant and children will be allowed to participate 9 in this study.  10  11 Risk for pregnancy: Since the study drug (mito-MES) has not been studied in pregnant women, 12 women of child bearing potential should use a barrier method that prevents pregnancy in 13 combination with a highly effective method of contraception.  Highly effective methods are: 14 • oral contraceptive   15 • Use of condoms during any sexual intercourse during the study period 16 • intrauterine device 17 • intrauterine hormonal releasing systems 18 • Bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion 19 • Vasectomized partner provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the participant and [ADDRESS_639340] not been established in humans, men of 23 child bearing potential should use a barrier method that prevents pregnancy during any sexual 24 encounter during the study period. Highly effective methods for men are: 25 • Use of condoms during any sexual intercourse during the study period 26 
• Vasectomized study participant who has received medical assessment confirming surgical 1 success. 2  3 Minimizing Specific Risks Related to therapy: Risks of oral Mito-MES treatment will be 4 minimized by: 5 • careful telephone screening of subjects; 6 • conducting all study activities in a safe, supervised clinical research setting; 7 • monitoring of the status of all subjects throughout the protocol by [CONTACT_497173] [ADDRESS_639341]. Kelesidis; 9 • using a dose and duration of Mito-MES treatment shown to be safe and well tolerated in 10 humans;  11 • having subjects consume Mito-MES with food to minimize gastrointestinal discomfort.  [ADDRESS_639342] they are aiding in important medical research and that the knowledge obtained from 20 this study will advance potential treatments for viral infections including COVID-19. The risks to 21 individual participants are outweighed by [CONTACT_497174] 22 society – namely, extensive contribution to the medical knowledge bank. The risks are relatively [ADDRESS_639343]. 24  25 
DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  1  2 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  3  4 a) Medical Supervision and Subject Surveillance. [CONTACT_497178], board certified [ADDRESS_639344] and infectious diseases/HIV specialists, will serve as the Physicians of Record for the [ADDRESS_639345] screening/enrollment and monitor/oversee clinical status and [ADDRESS_639346]. Kelesidis. 10 b) Data Safety Monitoring Plan. To ensure the safety of subjects, they will need to meet 11 rigorous inclusion/ exclusion criteria, including comprehensive health screening procedures. The 12 participants’ personal physicians will also be informed of their patients’ participation in the study. 13 Supervising Physician. The local investigator (Kelesidis) will have access to all data related to 14 safety assessments. Safety will be monitored via questionnaire. Safety assessments will be 15 performed at study visits. At the screening visit, after review of eligibility, subjects will provide a 16 detailed clinical history (including smoking, alcohol and medication history). Subjects will then 17 undergo a full clinical systems review.  18  19 The local investigator (Kelesidis) will be available to provide direct evaluation of any clinically-20 related concerns that might arise during the study. The principal investigator (Kelesidis) will 21 directly discuss with the members of UCLA IRB any concerns for adverse events and make 22 recommendations for continuing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. Given published safety data of Mito-MES 23 we do not anticipate any major clinical side effects related to safety of Mito-MES especially 24 since every effort will be made to minimize any potential side effects such as nausea 25 
(administration of <80 mg of Mito-MES, administration with a full stomach, exclusion of 1 participants with known gastrointestinal disease that may predispose them to nausea). 2  3  4 Interpretation of Results/Statistical Analyses:  5  6 There is no formal hypothesis testing in this exploratory study and a comparison with a 7 dedicated control group. Observational and descriptive data related to efficacy and safety of use 8 of MitoQ for viral infections will be obtained and these data will set the foundation for larger 9 controlled clinical trials. All categorical and continuous data (outlined above) will be recorded as 10 median and interquartile range (given small sample size). Exploratory analyses will be [ADDRESS_639347] by [CONTACT_497175] (symptoms present yes or 14 no) via Fisher’s exact Chi square, and subsequently via the independent two-sample t test for 15 symptom severity among those who are symptomatic. Non-normally distributed data will be 16 analyzed via the Mann–Whitney U test. Females may have differences in mitochondria [ADDRESS_639348] secondary analyses to explore if effects of 18 MitoQ will vary by [CONTACT_154329]; however, a fully powered, sex- and race-stratified analysis is 19 beyond the scope of this study. 20  21 Sensitivity analyses: Sensitivity analyses will be performed based on established guidelines 22 regarding the performance of sensitivity analyses in clinical trials92,93.  Intention-to-treat analysis 23 (as primary analysis), As-treated analysis, Per-protocol analysis will be performed to assess 24 non-compliance or protocol violation. Analyses will be performed with and without outliers as 25 
assessed by z-score or boxplot. The primary analysis will be compared with the analysis that 1 ignores clustering with one primary method chosen to account for clustering. Analysis will be 2 performed with and without adjustment for baseline characteristics. Finally, analyses will be 3 performed under different distributional assumptions, if applicable.  4  5 Adjustments for multiple comparisons: Notably, the proposed study is exploratory and there is 6 less need for a multiple-testing correction, as any false-positive findings will not change practice. 7 Any findings will be tested in further confirmatory clinical trials.  8  9 Missing data 10  11 Investigators will make efforts to minimize the amount of missing data including providing 12 reminders (e.g., phone calls, text messages, email) to trial subjects to complete PRO 13 instruments, monitoring compliance with PRO instrument completion throughout the 14 assessment period, following up with trial subjects who are not successfully completing PRO 15 instruments (and, where permissible, close contacts if the trial subject is not responding), and [ADDRESS_639349] always become symptomatic before any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497166] 6 result in missing data with regards to the primary outcome. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497167] 7 considered a form of missing data in this case. If the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497168] 8 infection such as SARS-CoV-2 infection and study participant was asymptomatic at the time of 9 death, then the investigators will consider the specific datapoints as “missing data” that will be [ADDRESS_639350] always become symptomatic before any death and death would not result in missing 17 data with regards to the primary outcome. The death will not be considered a form of missing 18 data in this case. If the death is not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and study participant 19 was asymptomatic at the time of death, then the investigators will consider the specific 20 datapoints as “missing data” that will be determined as outlined in this section.    21  22 Missing data will be handled by [CONTACT_497176], which assumes that the 23 missing data mechanism is ‘missing at random’. The analysis will be redone by [CONTACT_6222] [ADDRESS_639351] decides to discontinue treatment or discontinue participation in 1 the trial, including follow-up for key outcomes, while adhering to informed consent requirements.  2  3  Sample Size Considerations 4  5 Power/Sample Size: [ADDRESS_639352] the safety of 9 mito-MES in the setting of treatment of viral illnesses. In addition, preliminary data will be 10 obtained on the efficacy of Mito-MES to reduce severity of viral illness.

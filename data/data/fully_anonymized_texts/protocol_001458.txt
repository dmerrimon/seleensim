Title of Study:  
  
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Confirmatory Phase 2 Study Assessing 
the Safety, Tolerability and Long- term Efficacy of Bryostatin in the Treatment of Moderately 
Severe Alzheimer’s Disease Subjects Not Receiving Memantine Treatment  
Study cen ter(s):  Approximately 20 sites in [LOCATION_002] (US)  
 
Protocol Number:  NTRP -101-204 
 
Study Duration:  Approximately 2 years  Study Phase: 2 
 
Objective:   
 
Primary objective:  
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and long- term efficacy of bryostatin 1 (hereafter referred 
to as bryostatin) for the treatment of moderately severe Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  
Study Drug :   Bryostatin 1 or matching Placebo  
Route of Administration: Intravenous by [CONTACT_229230] 45±5 minutes  
Number of Subjects : Approximately  100 subjects (approximately 220 subjects screened)  
Study Design  
This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study comparing bryostatin-1 to placebo for long- term efficacy in the treatment of moderately severe AD ( Mini Mental 
State Examination, 2
nd edition  scores of 10- 18 at baseline)  in the absence of  memantine. 
Eligible subjects will receive 7 doses of bryostatin (i.v., 20μg) or matching placebo during the first [ADDRESS_431368] treatment period. Cognitive tests will be assessed  at intervals 
during the study and 30 days after the final dose of study drug.  The primary endpoint is the total SIB score assessment obtained at Week 28, following completion of 2 courses of treatment.  
Randomization and Treatment  
Eligible subjects will be stratified based on baseline SIB total scores and will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment arms: 20µg bryostatin or placebo for twelve weeks , the first 
treatment period . The first two doses of study drug will be a loading dose 20% higher (i.e., 
24µg) than the assigned dose and will be administered one week apart.  Thereafter, the assigned dose of 20µg will commence with the third dose and be administered every other 
week. The second course of treatment will be identical to th e first, beginning 30 days after

minutes.  Subjects are scheduled to receive seven doses over [ADDRESS_431370] 
treatment p eriod  and seven doses over 12 weeks during the second treatment period.  The 
same treatment assigned at randomization will be administered during the second treatment 
period.  
 Cognitive Assessments  
• Severe Impairment Battery (SIB)  
• Mini Mental State Examination, 2
nd edition (MMSE-2) 
• Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living - Severe 
Impairment Version (ADCL- ADL -Sev)  
• Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) metrics. 
 
Safety Assessments 
 
• Treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
• Vital signs, physical examination including body weight 
• ECG parameters  
• Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS), and  
• Clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, blood chemistry) 
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary effica cy endpoint is the change from the pre- treatment baseline in the Severe 
Impairment Battery (SIB) total score at Week 28, after two 12- week courses of treatment.   
 
Secondary Efficacy End points   
 
• SIB total score at the end of the Week 42 follow- up visit , for subjects who completed 
week 42  
• SIB total score from baseline at Week 13  
• SIB total scores  from baseline at Weeks 9 , 20, 24 and 30 
• SIB total scores from baseline at Weeks 9 , 20, 24 and 30 for subjects  with baseline  
MMSE -2 scores of 10-14 and 15-18 
• SIB trends over time; individual -specific slopes of total SIB scores will be obtained for 
all patients.

Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
• Change from baseline in ADCS -ADL -Sev total score at Week 13  and Week 42, for 
subjects who completed week 42 
• Change from baseline in MMSE- 2 total score at Week 13  and Week 42, for subjects 
who completed week 42 
• Change from baseline in NPI [INVESTIGATOR_347141] 13  and Week 42, for subjects who 
completed week 42 
•  
Statistical Considerations:  
 
The primary objective for efficacy is to evaluate whether bryostatin is better than the control with respect to the primary and secondary SIB endpoints. Efficacy analyses will be conducted for the full analysis set (FAS), consistent with the modified intention -to-treat principle, defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 
one dose of randomized study medication and who had at least one post- baseline efficacy 
assessment.  
The per protocol analysis set (PP) is defined as all patients completing the study without 
major  protocol deviations.  To be included, subjects must have received at least 11  of the14 
doses (80%).  The completer analysis set (CAS) will be defined as all randomized subjects who completed two 12- week  course s of treatment, and who have a Week  28 SIB assessment.  
Efficacy analys es will also be conducted for the PP and CAS sets.  
 
Adverse event and other safety data will be analyzed descriptively in all subjects who received any dose of study drug (including partial infusions).  These data will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_314365].

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 19 of 82 1 INTRODUCTION   
1.0 Alzheimer’s  disease  
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia, affecting approximately 5.3 
million people in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and 30 million people worldwide.  There is a disproportionate representation of women with nearly 2/3 of the affected individuals being female.  Of the 5.3 million a ffected Americans , 5.1 million  are older than 65  (Alzheimer’s 
Association website www.alz .org, 2015).   Since aging is the single most important risk factor 
for development of dementia and medical advances are prolonging survival, the incidence of AD will increase.  The US Census Bureau data suggest that the number of individuals living until age 100 between the years 2000 and 2020 will increase by [CONTACT_726] 200% and the number of individuals living until age 90-95 will double.
4   By 2050 the number of 
individuals with Alzheimer’s disease will almost trip le to a projected 13.8 million.  In  2013, 
15.5 million family and friends provided 17.7 billion hours of unpaid  care to those with 
Alzheimer’s and other dementias – care valued at $220.2 billion (Alzheimer’s Association website  www.alz.org , 2015).  
The currently approved treatments for AD provide modest symptomatic benefit and do not alter the disease progression.  These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_314315] [tacrine (Cognex), donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (galanthamine, Reminyl)] and the N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, memantine 
(Namenda).  The development of a medication that produces a significant improvement in clinical symptoms and/or slows the progression of the disease would be a significant advance in the therapeutics of AD. 
The 
protein kinase C  (PKC ) signaling pathways have been shown to play an integral role in 
learning and memory. Several animal models have demonstrated that PKC is involved in the 
learning process.5, [ADDRESS_431389] 
shown age-specific changes of PKC isozyme distribution in the brain,8, 9 impaired PKC 
translocation, reduced levels of the PKC anchoring protein, RACK1,10 alterations in mitogen 
activated protein (MAP) kinase Erk1/2,11 and reduced levels of the α -secretase cleaved 
Amyloid Precursor Protein  (APP), soluble amyloid precursor prot ein alpha (sAPPα), in the 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF).12  Aging of normal human fibroblasts also reduced secretion of 
sAPPα.   
The demonstration of reduced levels of PKC in the brain of Alzheimer’s subject s suggests a 
potential target to improve cognition in AD is the activation of PKC which in turn activates a 
series of downstream pathways that enhance synaptic function and promote synaptogenesis. Bryostatin is a potent stimulator of PKCε and is non-tumorigenic. Hongpaisan et.al 
[ADDRESS_431390] on synaptogenesis in two strains of transgenic AD mice.  Their work was recently reproduced by [CONTACT_314366], et.al.

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 20 of 82 Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) , prevention of synapse loss, reduced plaque 
formation and restored memory and learning even in the presence of plaques.  
1.1 Rationale for the use of bryostatin in the treatment of AD  
The pharmacological basis for the use of bryostatin for the treatment of AD is based on the 
hypothesis that low dose, intermittent administration of bryostatin will activate PKC isozymes α and ε. Activation of PKC is associated with:  
• Enhanced associative learning and recent memory via PKC-mediated phosphorylation 
of downstream substrates 
• Increased synthesis of proteins such as MAP kinase Erk1/2, and synaptogenic proteins such as BDNF required for long- term memory  
• Activat ion of α -secretases, thereby [CONTACT_314368]-toxic fragment s of the beta-
amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) and reducing the neurotoxic fragment of βAPP, 
Aβ
1-42, and the associated neuropathology 
• Activat ion of Aβ 1-42 – degrading enzymes  
• Phosphorylation of [COMPANY_004]-3 beta, inhibiting production of Tau and the associated 
neuropathology 
• Improved memory and learning in 3 different strains of transgenic mice with single or 
multiple Alzheimer’s gene mutations even in  the presence of amyloid plaque 13-15  
 
Thus, activation of PKC can enhance existing synaptic function, reduce the toxic effects of amyloid and promote synaptogenesis, all potential targets to improve cognitive function in 
AD.  
1.2 Pharmacokinetics , Toxicology and Drug Metabolism in Animals   
Single dose toxicity of bryostatin has been characterized in four non-GLP studies conducted 
under National Cancer Institute’s ( NCI) IND, including three IV toxicity studies in mice and 
one IV toxicity study in rats.  Bryostatin was evaluated in a single GLP –repeated dose 21-day 
IV toxicity study in rats.  The single dose toxicity  studies were conducted using two different 
dosing formu lations: bryostatin in ethanol/saline or bryostatin in polyethylene glycol, 
ethanol, and 
Tween 80 ( PET) diluent.  LD 50 ranged from a low of 38µg/kg to 75µg/kg.  The 
21-day repeat -dose toxic study performed in rats at doses of 0, 10, 15 and 25µg/m2 with the 
ethanol/saline formulation  resulted in  no relevant toxicology findings.  The  maximum 
tolerated dose ( MTD ) and  no adverse effect level  (NOAEL ) were noted to be 25µg/m2 the 
highest dose studied.  However , since there were no toxicologically relevant findings, the 
report  suggested that the MTD and NOAEL are greater than  25µg/m2. 
Two preliminary dose range finding IV toxicology studies were performed in the rat and dog to characterize the toxicity of  bryostatin and to estimate the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) 
when administered by [CONTACT_314369].  In the Sprague- Dawley rat 
bryostatin was tolerated up to 10µg/kg (infusion) and  15ug/kg (bolus) with no significant 
differences in t oxicity noted between the two routes of administration.  In the beagle dog 
bryostatin was tolerated at doses up to 15µg/kg (infusion and  bolus).  There were no

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 21 of 82 significant differences in toxicity between the two routes of administration.  A more detailed 
results summary can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
Limited pharmacokinetics ( PK) data are available in animals .  The pharmacokinetics of 
bryostatin  was analyzed in female CD1/F2 mice by [CONTACT_2329] [C26- 3H]-labeled bryostatin 
following IV and IP administration (Zhang et al 1996).  Following IV administration of 
40µg/kg (120mg/m2), the plasma disappearance curve for bryostatin could be described by a 
2-compartment model, with a distribution t ½ of 1.[ADDRESS_431391] 12 hours after IV administration, with 23.0 ± 1.9% (mean ± standard deviation) of the administered dose excreted. Approximately equal amounts of radioactivity (40%) were excreted in feces compared with urine within 72 hours after IV administration.  A greater area under the curve, longer mean resident time, and lower clearance were observed with IP administration compared with IV administration.   Bryostatin  was widely distributed to various tissues 
following both IV and IP administration.  However, accumulation was observed in the lung, liver, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and fatty tissue.  
1.3 Genotoxicity  
Bryostatin  1 was evaluated using the bacterial reverse mutation assay (i.e., the Ames test)  
with no positive responses observed.  Bryostatin  1 was evaluated as negative 
(nonclastogenic) in the micronucleus assay; it was also evaluated as negative (non -DNA 
damaging) in the Comet Assay.  Overall, based on the results of the Ames test and the combined micronucleus/comet assay, bryostatin 1 is  not considered to be genotoxic. 
2 CLINICAL TRIAL DATA 
2.0 Oncology Data  
Safety data are available from published clinical studies of bryostatin for the treatment of cancer.  Altogether, over 1400 oncology subjects received b ryostatin , mainly under NCI’s 
IND # 42,780, with exposures to bryostatin in both single and combination agent studies.  About [ADDRESS_431392] s received bryostatin as monotherapy, with dose levels ranging from 
5μg/m
2 to >1 80μg/m2.  Most subject s in both the monotherapy and combination therapy 
studies received bryostati n at doses >25μg/m2, most often as [ADDRESS_431393] studies were repeated dose studies w here subjects received treatment for several weeks  (See 
Investigators Brochure).  
Adverse events occurring in the single agent studies that resulted in discontinuation from the 
studies were myalgia ([ADDRESS_431394] s), acute transient reaction (dyspnea, flushing, hypotension, 
and bradycardia; 4 subjects each), phlebitis (attributed to ethanol in the formulations, [ADDRESS_431395] s), fatigue ([ADDRESS_431396] s), and [ADDRESS_431397] pain, dehydration,

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 22 of 82 dysphagia, hematuria, nausea, skin rash, subclavian vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and 
vomiting.  The following AEs were associated with death in the single agent tr ials: cardiac 
arrest (2), hypotensive with evidence of renal and hepatic failure (1), perforated gastric ulcer (1), renal functi on decline with cardiac arrest and perforated gastric ulcer (1; PI s considered 
not related to bryostatin), and sudden death (1; PI s considered likely to be cardiovascular 
event).  Relatedness to bryostatin treatment was not assessed except where noted.  
Other severe (Grade 3 or higher) AEs reported in the single agent clinical studies in cancer 
subject s included: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (elevated; subject  had pre- existing liver 
metastases), allergic reaction, anemia, anorexia, arthralgia, ataxia, cardiac arrhythmias, 
cardiovascular, coagulation, community-acquired pneumonia, congestive heart failure, constipation, dermatitis, dermatologic, diarrhea, dyspnea, edema/weight gain, fever, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, granulocytopenia, headache, hepatic, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, infection, leg weakness, lymphedema, lymphocytopenia, myocardial infarction, neurotoxicity, neutropenia, pain (abdominal, back, eye, site not specified), pulmonary, pulmonary embolus from inferior vena cava tumor thrombus, sepsis and pneumonia without neutropenia, syncope, and urinary frequency. 
The absence of a Placebo -control group in bryostatin oncology studies makes it difficult to 
determine the extent to which underlying disease or concomitant medications may have 
contributed to this safety profile.   
2.1 Alzheimer’s  Disease  Data 
2.1.1 Study NTRP101-203 
NTRP 101-203 was a rando mized, double-blind, placebo -contro lled, phase 2 trial asse ssing 
the safety, tolerability (primary objective) and efficacy (secondary objective) of bryostatin in 
the tr eatment of moderately severe to sever e Alzheimer’ s disease subjects.  This study was 
intended to confirm the results of study NTRP101-202 both in safety and efficacy for subjects not receiving concurrent memantine treatment at time points through Week 15. 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Methodology 
 
The study was designed to have an initial telephonic prescreening, followed by [CONTACT_347171] s tratified based on MMSE-2 
scores: 4 -9 vs. 10- 15 and randomized 1:1 to either 20μg bryostatin or placebo treatment arm, 
and then treated for 12 weeks. The study drug was administered via continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 45(±5) minutes. The first tw o doses of study drug administered were a loading dose 20% higher (i.e., 
24μg) than the assigned treatment given one week apart. Subsequently, the assigned doses of 20μg were commenced as the third dose and were delivered every other week.  The primary endpoint for this study was the change from baseline to Week 13 in the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) total score.  The changes from baseline at Weeks 5, 9, and 15 in the 
SIB total score, and the changes from baseline at each tested time point for subjects in each

[IP_ADDRESS] Demographics  
A sum total of [ADDRESS_431398]’s lacking 
to fulfill the  inclusion /exclusion criteria for eligibility of the study. A total of 111 subjects 
were randomized to bryostatin (55 subjects) and placebo (56) treatment arms. Of the s ubjects 
randomized to bryostatin, 96.4% (96.4%, 53/55) received treatment. The study was completed by 87.3% subjects (87.3%, 48/55) and the remaining seven subjects (12.7%,7/55) did not complete the study primarily due to withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130] (9.1%, 5/55) followed by [CONTACT_347172] (1.8%, 1/55 each). Of 56 subjects assigned to placebo treatment, 98.2% (98.2%, 55/56) received placebo. Of these, 85.7% (85.7, 48/56) completed the study and 14.3% (14.3%, 8/56) terminated due to either subject withdrawal (5.4%,3/56), adverse event, lost to follow up, physician’s decision, death or other reasons (1.8%, 1/56 each). Approximately 56% of subjects (56.5%, 61/108) in the Safety Analysis Set were females. The majority of the  subjects were white (84.3%, 91/108) and not of Hispanic or Latino 
background. The mean (SD) age of the subjects in the Safety Analysis Set was 72 years.  
 No disparities between the study treatment groups were noted in majority of the baseline characteristics; however, there is a 5 unit difference in the baseline total score of Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), indicating subjects with a greater impairment we re randomized  to 
the bryostatin group. The mean baseline SIB score of the two randomized populations were 73.7 in bryostatin group and 78.6 for the placebo group.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Safety  
 
A total of 116 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported for 47 subjects in the study (43.5%,47/108). In bryostatin group, 57 AEs were reported by 23 subjects (43.4%, 23/53). In the placebo group, 59 AEs were reported by 24 (43.6%, 24/55) subjects. The majority of AEs were either mild or moderate. A total of 16 related AEs were reported in 11 subjects (10.2%, 11/108). There were 7 related AEs reported for 5 subjects (9.4%, 5/53) in the bryostatin group, and 9 related  AEs for 6 subjects (10.9%; 6/55) in placebo group. A total of 15 serious adverse 
events (SAE) were reported for 11 subjects (10.2%, 11/108) in bryostatin and placebo groups combined. One reported AE in placebo group resulted in death. A total of four AEs led to drug withdrawal in one subject (0.9%, 1/108). A sum total of 12 AEs led to interruption in drug scheduling regimen (4.6%, 5/108). 11 subjects reported 15 SAEs together in bryostatin and placebo groups. However, all of the 15 observed SAEs were considered to be ‘unlikely related’ 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-[ADDRESS_431399] was randomized 
to the placebo group and the cause of death is unknown. Details regarding adverse events can be

[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy  
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the change in the SIB total score from baseline 
to Week 13. Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) scoring is used to assess cognition in subjects with moderate and severe AD and is a useful outcome measure in advanced stages of disease. Forty questions are included with a point score range of 0-100. Lower scores indicat e greater 
cognitive impairment. The mean baseline SIB score of the two randomized populations were 73.7 in bryostatin group and 78.6 for the placebo group. At week 13, the mean SIB score for bryostatin and placebo reached 76.0 and 80.9, respectively. An average increase of 1.3 point and 2.1 points was observed for the bryostatin and placebo groups, respectively at Week 13 and the difference between the treatment groups was not statistically significant.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Summary  
The bryostatin treatment group showed minimal differences from the placebo treatment 
group in safety assessments , with  an imbalance of 4.6 units in the baseline SIB scores 
between the bryostatin treatment group and the placebo group. The majority of AEs were 
either mild or moderate.  There were no statistically significant bryostatin/placebo 
differences in efficacy assessments.   
2.1.2 Study NTRP101-202  
NTRP 101-202 was a rando mized, double-blind, placebo -contro lled, phase 2 trial asse ssing 
the safet y and tolerabilit y (primary objective)  and efficacy (secondary objective) of bryostatin 
in the tr eatment of moderately severe to sever e Alzheimer’ s disease subjects.  Exploratory 
objectives characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of bryostatin in 
this subject population. Seven doses of study drug were administered by a 45- minute 
continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 12 weeks.  
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Methodology 
Eligible subjects with moderately severe to severe AD were stratified based on Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE -2) scores 4 -9 vs. 10-15 and randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment 
arms: 20μg, 40μg, or placebo for twelve weeks. Trial drug was adm inistered IV by 
[CONTACT_3365]. The first two doses (24μg, 48μg) of each of the two active treatment arms were a loading dose, 20% higher than the assigned dose (20μg, 40μg), and were administered one week apart. Thereafter, the assigned dose commenced with the third dose and was administered every other week. Subjects were scheduled to receive seven doses over [ADDRESS_431400] dose of trial drug administration.

Full Analysis Set (FAS). A total of 113 subjects out of 147 randomized (76.9%) performed a Week 13 evaluation of the SIB and were analyzed as the Completer Analysis Set (CAS). A total of 106 subjects in the SAS completed the trial (75.2%). A total of [ADDRESS_431403] common reason for early withdrawal was withdrawal of consent (18 subjects), followed by [CONTACT_117795] (11 subjects).

Safety  
Overall, the 20μg bryostatin treatment group showed minimal differences from the placebo treatment group in safety assessments. The 40μg bryostatin treatment group had significantly greater AEs than the other treatment groups. There was also no clear difference in Serious Adverse events (SAEs) between the 20μg bryostatin group and placebo treatment groups, and again the 40μg bryostatin treatment group had significantly greater SAEs than the other treatment group.  Similarly, the placebo and 20μg group had similar numbers of TEAEs (28 events vs 30 events, respectively). The TEAEs observed more often in the 20μg treatment group vs placebo were infusion site reaction (8 events vs 3 events in placebo) and diarrhea (5 events vs 1 event in placebo). The 40μ g treatment group was associated with more TEAEs than either 
the 20μg or placebo treatment groups across multiple system organ classes (SOC).  The most common treatment related TEAEs were grouped infusion reactions, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, and myalgia. Myalgia was seen in 5 subjects; 4 of those subjects were given the higher dose of bryostatin. Myalgia observed was mostly mild and managed with analgesics. There were also more treatment related TEAEs of diarrhea, headache,  and fatigue 
in the higher dose bryostatin group. Both bryostatin treatment groups reported higher rates of infusion site TEAEs, and in particular the 40μg bryostatin treatment group reported 4 events of infusion site cellulitis. Although IV infusion- related reactions were also reported  more 
often in the higher dose bryostatin group, none were reported following WebEx- based 
training on IV infusion and universal precautions, suggesting that this AE can be prevented.  The higher dose bryostatin group also reported more TEAEs of seizure and fall compared to 
the lower dose bryostatin and placebo groups.  A total of 97 (68.8%) subjects in all treatment groups reported 287 separate TEAEs. Of these, 49 (34.8%) subjects reported 107 separate treatment-related TEAEs. There were 8 (16.7%) subjects with 20 treatment-related TEAEs in the placebo treatment group, 17 (37.0%) subjects with 30 events in the 20μg bryostatin treatment group, and 24 (51.1%) subjects with 57 events in the 40μg bryostatin treatment group. Six subjects had a TEAE that lead to t rial 
drug discontinuation, 2 in the placebo treatment group, 1 in the 20μg bryostatin treatment group, and 3 in the 40μg bryostatin treatment group.  Overall, 43 (30.5%) subjects had a TEAE that was mild in intensity, 46  (32.6%) subjects had a TEAE that was moderate in 
intensity, and 8 (5.7%) subjects had a TEAE that was severe in intensity. 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-[ADDRESS_431404] in the 40μg bryostatin treatment group who suffered 
a severe TEAE of worsening of AD that was unrelated to the IP.  There were 12 (8.5%) subjects who had 14 treatment emergent non-fatal SAEs during the trial; 4 subjects with 4 events in the placebo treatment group, 2 subjects with 2 events in the 20μg bryostatin treatment group, and 6 subjects with 8 SAEs in the 40µg bryostatin t reatment 
group. A total of 4 subjects in the 40μg bryostatin treatment group had 4 events that were judged as possibly or probably related to the IP: [ADDRESS_431405] vital signs, PEs, and ECG. However, there was a decline in weight in the bryostatin groups, which was more prominent in the higher dose group: 20μg bryostatin treatment group (mean loss of -1.65±2.77kg) and the 40μg bryostatin treatment group ( -2.98±2.10kg), while there was a 
slight weight gain in the placebo treatment group (0.442±2.52kg). Further, [ADDRESS_431406]

[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy  
Consistent with the initial hypothesis for bryostatin effects on PKC ε and cognition, treatment 
with 20μg of bryostatin is effective in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in a FAS and CAS. The overall weight of data shows that subjects treated with 20μg bryostatin displayed signific ant improvement on the SIB, ADCS -ADL -Sev, and other secondary and exploratory 
endpoints (one- sided at α=0.10) , as outlined below. 
Baseline scores on the SIB for the FAS were similar across all treatment groups. In the FAS, the treatment difference between the placebo treatment group and the 20μg bryostatin treatment group was statistically significant only at Week 5 (treatment difference 3.0[0.6, 5.3]
80%CI  P=0.056). There were no statistically significant differences between the placebo 
treatment group and either the 20μg bryostatin treatment group or 40μg bryostatin treatment 
group at Week 9 or Week 13. Combining the bryostatin treatment groups and comparing with the placebo treatment group also did not produce a statistically significant difference at any time point.  For the CAS, pre-specified along with FAS to assess primary and secondary endpoints, mean scores on the SIB followed the same pattern seen in the FAS. Baseline scores were similar across all treatment groups. There was a statistically signific ant difference, however, between 
the placebo treatment group and the 20μg bryostatin treatment group at Week 5 (P=0.016), and the treatment difference at Week 13 was also statistically significant (P=0.070). Further, when both bryostatin treatment groups w ere pooled, there was a statistically significant 
difference between the placebo treatment group and pooled group at Week 5 (P=0.039) and a statistically significant treatment difference at Week 13 (P=0.094). There were no

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 27 of 82 statistically significant differe nces between the placebo treatment group and the 
40μg bryostatin treatment group at any time point. 
In the CAS there were significant differences in the ADCS -ADL -Sev at Week 13 between 
the placebo treatment group and the 20μg bryostatin treatment group (P= 0.082), and between 
the placebo treatment group and pooled bryostatin treatment group (P=0.087). There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups for the ADCS -ADL -Sev, 
MMSE -2, NPI, or CGI-I assays for any time point in the FAS. 
In multiple exploratory analyses adjusting for covariates for the primary endpoint, there were additional significant differences between the placebo treatment group and bryostatin treatment groups. In an MMRM analysis of change from baseline in SIB total score, excluding all subjects from sites that recruited 2 or fewer subjects during the trial, there was a significant difference between the placebo treatment group and the 20μg bryostatin treatment group at Week 5 (P=0.068). There was a significant differ ence between the placebo treatment

bryostatin dose in general had a better response to treatment than higher tertiles or placebo (these data w ere also not analyzed statistically). Subjects treated with bryostatin who did not 
take memantine at baseline had significantly better improvement in SIB score compared to the placebo group in an MMRM analyses of SIB total score in both the CAS and FAS. Both the pooled bryostatin and 20μg bryostatin treatment groups had significantly better scores than the placebo treatment group at Weeks 5, 13, and at 30- day Follow -up. Similar results 
(which were not statistically analyzed) were seen in the ADCS -ADL -Sev test and in the NPI 
10-item score.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics  
Mean plasma bryostatin concentrations increased approximately proportional to dose f or an  
increase in dose between 20μg and 40μg, infused IV over 45 minutes. The median Tmax occurred at the end of the 45-min infusion. 
Mean Cmax ranged from 0.563 ng/mL to 0.653 ng/mL after 20 μg and from 0.792 ng/mL to  
1.34 ng/mL after 40μg. Mean T1/2 rang ed from 1.33 h to 5.37 h.  Mean CL was similar for 
both dose levels and ranged from 24.97 L/h to 28.42 L/h for Weeks 0 and 3. The mean CL on 
Weeks 7 and 11 was slightly lower, ranging from 13.38 L/h to 23.91 L/h. 
Within a given dose level, the ranges of values for Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf were 
consistent across weeks and there was no indication of systemic accumulation of bryostatin during administration of bryostatin once every 2 weeks. 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Summary  
Bryostatin treatment was in general safe to use and well tolerated.  
The 20μg bryostatin treatment group had similar numbers of TEAEs to the placebo treatment 
group except in injection site reactions and diarrhea. The 40μg treatment group had more 
TEAEs an d SAEs than the 20μg or placebo treatment groups across many SOCs.  
The 40μg dose of bryostatin was associated with more TEAEs. With a decrease in systemic 
CL especially noted with 40µg bryostatin dosing, the higher drug exposure may further explain the increased number of TEAEs. The most common treatment related TEAEs were 
diarrhea, headache, fatigue, and myalgia, and all were reported in greater frequency with the 
40μg dose of bryostatin. Subjects given the 40μg dose of bryostatin also reported more TEAEs  of seizure and fall.

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 29 of 82 The primary efficacy endpoint for the SIB and secondary efficacy endpoint for the ADCS -
ADL -Sev was met in the CAS with the 20μg dose, which was statistically significantly 
different from placebo at Weeks 5 and 13. The 40μg dose was not statistically significant 
from the placebo.  SIB improvement was significant for the Week 5 FAS measurement (p< .056). No other 
primary or secondary endpoints were met in the FAS. Multiple exploratory analyses in the FAS for covariates in the primary and secondary 
endpoints revealed additional significant differences, but these occurred predominantly at the 
Week [ADDRESS_431409] s with mild to moderate AD (MMSE: 14 -26).  Subjects were randomized 
2:1 to receive bryostatin 25µg/m
2 or Placebo .  The primary objective was to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of bryostatin by [CONTACT_347173] .  Secondary safety 
endpoints included assessment of physical examination, hematology including complete 
blood count (CBC) and platelet count, coagulation parameters , serum chemistries , ECG, 
urinalysis and vital signs.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite end point of change from baseline in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Revised  (HVLT -R) delayed recall and Repeatable Battery of 
Assessments for Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS) figure recall at [ADDRESS_431410] study 
drug infusion. 
The study included single dose PK, and measurement of PKCε in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a potential biomarker.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographic s 
The study enrolled nine subjects, 4 male and 5 female,  with a mean age of 71.8 ±7.4 years 
(range 62 to 82).  The mean MMSE -2 at baseline was 22.5 for the three placebo  subjects 
(range 19-24) and 22 (range 16- 26) for the six bryostatin treated subject s. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Safety  
Bryostatin was well tolerated.  There were no deaths or SAEs  reported .  No subjects had an 
AE leading to withdrawal during the study.  There were five treatment emergent adverse 
events occurring in three subject s: headache, dizziness, and papular rash.  There were no 
reported epi[INVESTIGATOR_314319], a known side effect of bryostatin.  The only adverse event in the bryostatin treated group was headache, which was not considered related to study drug.  All adverse events were mild and resolved without treatment.  All laboratory asse ssments, 
including hematology, chemistry, coagulation, renal function and liver function as well as cardiac assessments were unremarkable after treatment and there was no clinically significant change in any vital signs.

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 30 of 82 [IP_ADDRESS] Efficac y  
There were no clinically significant differences between the mean or mean change from 
baseline between bryostatin and placebo in the HVLT- R or MMSE -[ADDRESS_431411] after a single dose of 25 μg/m2 
bryostatin. However, the possibility of an early effect on MMSE was identified even at small sample size and warrant ed further investigation in a more adequately powered trial. There 
was no difference in HVLT- R delayed recall or the RBANS delay ed figure recall at 48 hours.  
Additional time points of assessment for these measures (day 2, day 4 and day 15) did not indic ate any difference between groups.  Additional endpoints included the change from 
baseline in Digit Symbol Coding (DSC), and MMSE-[ADDRESS_431412] after  a single dose of 25μg/m

bryostatin. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics of bryostatin were assessed in [ADDRESS_431413] s following 25 µ g/m2 
bryostatin administered as a single 1-hour IV infusion.  Individual bryostatin plasma 
concentrations were observed to increase and approac h stead y-state within the 1 hour 
infusion periods, and then rapi[INVESTIGATOR_347145].  The bryostatin maximum plasma concentrations occurred at the end of the IV infusions, and had a mean (±standard deviation (SD)) value of 1.09 ±0.25 ng/mL.  A terminal elimination rate could not be calculated for most subject s due to sampling frequency , the rapid drug elimination, and 
the sensitivity limitations of the assay.  Based on the observed individual bryostatin plasma concentration profiles, the elimination t
1/2 associated with the observed drug exposure was 
estimated to be less than 30 minutes.  Total drug CL  was observed to be high (~ 40 L/h), 
consistent across the individual administered doses, and did not appear to be related to body weight, BSA, or sex.  The bryostatin pharmacokinetic parameters were observed to have low to modera te intersubject variability.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacodynamics/ PKC ε 
Preliminary assessment of PKCε concentration in PBMCs suggests there is an incre ase in the 
total amount of PKCε (cytosol plus membrane bound concentration ) following treatment 
with bryostatin.  Additional analysis is underway to further characterize the increase and pharmacodynamics.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Conclusions  
This wa s the first double-blind assessment of the safety of bryostatin treatment in subjects 
with Alzheimer’s disease.  The study met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability.  Bryostatin appears safe and we ll tolerated in this cohort of subjects with mild to moderate

3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  AND HYPOTHESIS 
3.0 Primary Objective  
To evaluate the safety , tolerability and long- term effi cacy of bryostatin for the treatment of 
moderately severe Alzheimer’s disease in subjects not receiving concurrent memantine 
treatment , including 1) how long the therapeutic effects will last; and 2) whether a second 
treatment would be equally effective if  the therapeutic effects of the first treatment do not 
last. 
3.1 Hypothesis  
Patients treated with bryostatin will experience a greater improvement in cognitive function 
as measured by [CONTACT_347174] 12 week  
courses of treatment , as compared to patients on placebo during the same time period.  The 
null hypothesis will be rejected at a significance level of a two -sided α = 0.05. The test of the 
null hypothesis will be a superiority test based on the treatment difference in Week 28 SIB 
from baseline means as assessed by [CONTACT_347175] (GEE) regression, and only 
an improvement in the SIB score from baseline is of clinical significance.  
  
4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.0 Overview of  Study Design    
This is a randomized double-blind placebo -controlled exploratory study assessing bryostatin 
for the treatment of moderately severe Alzheimer’s disease in subjects not receiving memantine treatment.  The first treatment period of the study is [ADDRESS_431415] treatment. Eligible subjects will be stratified based on  SIB total scores at baseline and will be randomized 1 :[ADDRESS_431416] two doses of study drug will be a loading 
dose 20% higher (i.e., 24µg) than the assigned dose and will be administered one week apart. There after, the assigned dose of 20µg will commence with the third dose and be administered 
every other week for [ADDRESS_431417] treatment period  and seven doses over 12 weeks in the second period according to the 
original blinded, randomized treatment assignment.  Safety and efficacy assessments will be

cumulative and likely related to the down regulation of PKC ε.  This was not seen in the 
NTRP101-201 study, in which there were no reports of myalgia after a single 25µg/m
[ADDRESS_431419].  In NTRP101-202, in which subjects received 7 doses of study drug, myalgia was seen in 5 subjects; 4 of those subjects were given the higher 40µg dose of bryostatin. Myalgia observed was mostly mild and managed with analgesics.  
Dosing in this study will begin with two initial loading doses at one- week intervals that are 
20% higher than the maintenance dose (i.e., 24µg ) to assure enzyme activation. Dosing will 
then continue with  20μg administered every other week  for [ADDRESS_431420] is 14 
doses. 
4.2 Risk/Benefit  
Bryostatin treatment in study NTRP101-[ADDRESS_431421] hoc  analysis in 
NTRP101-202 clearly showed that bryostatin- treated s ubjects who did not take memantine at 
baseline had significantly better improvement in SIB score compared to the placebo group in 
an MMRM analyses of SIB total score in both the CAS and FAS. Both the pooled bryostatin 
(20μg and 40μg)  and 20μg bryostatin treatment groups had significantly bett er scores than 
the placebo treatment group at Weeks 5, 13, and at 30-day Follow-up. There were no 
statistical differences in SIB score between treatment groups in subjects given memantine at baseline.    
Therapeutic antibodies targeting β -amyloid have been associated with the occurrence of 
amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which is similar in appearance to cerebral 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-[ADDRESS_431422] no alternative treatments available.  Based on the available nonclinical and clinical data, and the low risk of ARIA, the potential benefits of treatment with bryostatin at the proposed dose in this protocol outweigh the risks.

Suicidality AEs  or other clinical observations may, based on the judgment of the PI , also trigger 
a risk assessment and a narrative.  When there is a positive response to any question on the C-SSRS, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_347150].  
6.0.2 Efficac y / Psychometric Assessments 
All raters for the efficacy assessments need to be trained and qualified on the administration of the scales.  A qualified  rater is required for the administration of  the SIB , NPI [INVESTIGATOR_314327]-2.  
The same qualified rater should perform a given Efficacy/Psychometric Assessment at approximately the same time of day for a given subject throughout the study.  All changes in raters for a given assessments must be noted in the subject’s source documents.  The caregiver designated to provide assessments ( ADCS -ADL -Sev and NPI) at the start of the study should be 
the same individual throughout the study.  Should a change be necessary during the course of the study, the reason for the change and the first corresponding visit must be noted in the subject’s source document. 
All psychometric tests performed on study subjects on the same day should be administered in 
the following order: SIB followed by [CONTACT_157513]-2, except at the screening visit as described in Section 6.2.1. If the MMSE -2 score obtained at screening does not fall within the 10-18 range for 
inclusion, no further screening tests should be performed.  Efficacy  tests at subsequent visits 
should be administered prior to dosing. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rosen -Modified Hachinski Scale  
The Rosen -Modifie d Hachinski Scale will be evaluated at screening to differentiate Alzheimer’s 
type dementia from multi- infarct dementia.  The 8 -item scale results in a score of 0 -12; and a 
score of 5 or above is exclusionary for the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severe Impairment Battery  
The SIB is used to assess cognition in subjects with moderate and severe AD.   It is divided into 
nine subscales that include attention, language, orientation, memory, praxis, visuospatial ability, 
construction, social skills, orienting head to name.  Non -verbal responses are allowed, thus 
decreasing the need for language output.  Forty  questions are included with a point score range 
of 0-100. Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.

Severe Impairment Version  
The ADCS -ADL -Sev is a 19 -item functional assessment of the performance of activities of daily 
living for subjects with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease.  Informants are queried via a 
structured interview format as to whether subjects attempted each item in the inventory during 
the previous [ADDRESS_431451] level of independent performance to complete loss.  Total score ranges from 0 -54 with lower 
scores indicating greater functional impairment.   The ADCS -ADL -Sev may be administered via

Items are scored for both frequency and severity.  Total scores range from 0 -120 with higher scores indicating greater 
behavioral disturbances.  For each item, the associated caregiver distress is also assessed.  
6.1 Visit Procedures  
6.1.1 Screening and Randomization (Days -28 to -2) 
In order to avoid unnecessary screen failures, a prescreening telephone call to rule out clearly exclusionary conditions is advised prior to scheduling a screening visit.  In addition, a P re-
Screening Consent form will be provided, allowing access to medical records prior to a subject’s  
onsite screening visit.  Use of this consent will reduce the occurrence of onsite screening vi sits 
by [CONTACT_347184].  No study procedures will be performed under this preliminary consent.  Informed Consent must be obtained before any study related procedures are performed. Screening procedures and random ization will take place within 
an approximate 4-week period prior to first dose administration (Days -28 to -2).   
Subjects who are screen -failed (e.g. due to clinically significant laboratory abnormality or an 
active medical condition) may be re -screened if their medical condition stabilizes or improves as 
assessed by [CONTACT_978].  Subject who are screen -failed due to MMSE  score may be rescreened in [ADDRESS_431453] s:

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 61 of 82 9 DATA ANALYSIS / STATISTICAL METHODS  
Detailed methodology for summa ry and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study will 
be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  This separate document will be finalized 
prior to study unblinding and conduct of any statistical analyses.  The SAP may modify and wi ll 
take precedence over the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications or modification of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. 
The primary efficacy outcome will be  the dif ference in SIB total score from baseline at Week [ADDRESS_431468] been given.   
9.0 Sample Size Determination   
The power analysis for the current study is based on a minimum clinically significant difference 
in mean total SIB scores from baseline of 4 points between the placebo and bryostatin arms at Week 28. Since the analysis of this primary outcome is based on a linear regression model that utilizes the total SIB scores at Weeks 0, 5,  9, 13, 15, 20, 24, and 28, a difference of 
approximately 1.5 points per week in the slope of total SIB scores between the placebo and bryostatin arms yields the clinically meaningful difference of 4 points at Week 28. As these measures of total SIB scores  are correlated within individual, methods of GEE will be used to 
estimate the regression parameters of the linear regression model of total SIB score regressed on time. GEE power analysis is based on the following equation: 
    𝑚𝑚=  2�𝑧𝑧𝑎𝑎/2+𝑧𝑧𝑏𝑏�2𝜎𝜎2(1−𝜌𝜌 )
𝑛𝑛𝑠𝑠𝑥𝑥2𝑑𝑑2              Eq 1 
In equation 1, m  is the number of patients per group, 𝑧𝑧 𝑎𝑎/2is the type I error rate, 𝑧𝑧𝑏𝑏is the type II 
error rate, σ is the standard deviations of the error (residual) terms, ρ  is the within person 
correlation of total SIB scores over time within a person, n is the time points where the total SIB 
score is obtained, 𝑠𝑠𝑥𝑥2is the variance of the X  predictor variable (i.e. time in the current scenario), 
and d is the difference in slopes over time in total SIB measures from baseline between the 
placebo and bryostatin arms.17 
Based on the data from the NTRP101-202 study among patients without memantine, we obtained 
an estimate for σ  = 5.3. In addition, the NTRP101 -[ADDRESS_431469] S IB total scores measured  
at n = 8 timepoints, giving a value of  𝑠𝑠𝑥𝑥2 = 127. A ssuming a total of 100 patients (50 patients per 
arm), a  two-sided type I error rate of 0.05 (i.e. 𝑧𝑧𝑎𝑎/2 = 1.96), and moderate within person correlation 
of outcome measures (i. e. ρ = 0.5), we will have > 99% power to see a difference in slopes over 
time of d = 0. [ADDRESS_431470] > 99% power to see this difference if  
we experience a 20% drop out. 
9.1 Statistical Methods

9.2 Exploratory Analysis 
Descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_347190]. These descriptive statistics will include the mean, median, SD, maximum and minimum for 
continuous variables, and frequencies, percentage, and tabulations for categorical variables. Summary statistics will also be performed on both the patient demographics and patient clinical characteristics. Exploratory plots of the data will also be created, including box plots and histograms, in order to determine the distribution of these data as well as to identify any unusual or outlying observations.   
 9.3 Safet y Analysis 
The SAS population will be used for all safety analyses with treatment group determined by [CONTACT_314391].  AEs, safety laboratory, ECGs, physical exam and vital signs data will be presented in tabular format and summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].  No formal hypothesis testing will be carried out on these safety assessments.  Incidence and severity of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_314392] (SOC).  AEs will be coded according to standard MedDRA terms.  
C-SSRS responses will be mapped onto the Columbia- Classification Algorithm of Suicide 
Assessment (C -CASA) scale, and the frequency distribution of the C- CASA scores will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_67486].  No hypotheses associated with the C- SSRS or C -
CASA scales will be tested.

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 63 of 82 9.4 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The treatment difference in the primary efficacy endpoint of total SIB scores from baseline at 
Week 28 will be determined from a regression model that utilize SIB values t aken at Weeks 0, 5, 
9, 13, 15, 20, 24, 28 and 30. As SIB is a continuous outcome measure, a regression model will be used to estimate the treatment difference in mean SIB from baseline at Week 28. Both linear and non-linear terms will be considered in these regression models. Since correlation of SIB 
measures over time within a patient will be present,  regression coefficients will be estimated 
using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) methodology.
[ADDRESS_431472] errors models are unbiased even if the working correlation model is incorrectly specified . The primary analysis will be conducted on FAS population. The PP and CAS 
populations will be used as supportive analyse s.  All statistical tests for efficacy will be two -
sided tests, with α=0.05.  
   Based on the review of patients not treated with memantine in the NTRP 101-203 clinical trial, the expected number of patients who will drop out of the study prematurely will not be significant.   However, missingness will be accounted for using weighted GEE methods.
19 The 
GEE regression models will be carried out in SAS /STAT PROC GEE  version 13.2. This SAS 
procedure will allow for implementation of weighted GEE methodology that can account for data missing a random. One additional patient may be randomized for each patient who discontinues the study prior to the primary endpoint (Week 28, Day 196).   
9.5 Secondary Efficacy En dpoint s 
Multiple comparisons arising from the listed secondary outcomes will be controlled by [CONTACT_347191]. This procedure will allow control of the type I error rate over the set of secondary outcomes that is less stringent then controlling for multiple comparisons using a familywise error rate (e.g. Bonferroni correction).

The linear regres sion models using the method of GEE as described in Sections 9.4 and 9.5.2 
will be used to estimate the treatment difference in mean SIB total scores from the original 
baseline (i.e. at screening) at Weeks 9,  20, 24 and 30. As desc ribed in Section 9.4, weighted GEE 
will be used to account for data that are missing at random. 
9.5.4 SIB total scores from baseline at Weeks 5, 9, 15, 20, and 24 for subjects with 
baseline MMSE -2 scores of 10-14 and 15-18 
The estimation of the treatment differe nces at Weeks 9, 20, 24 and 30 for patients within each 
MMSE -2 group will be based on GEE linear regression model utilizing SIB total scores from 
baseline at these five time points.  As described in Section 9.4, weighted GEE will be used to 
account for data that are missing at random. 
9.5.5 Individual patient’s SIB t rends over time  
For the secondary endpoint of SIB trends over time, individual- specific slopes of total SIB scores 
will be obtained for all patients. These slopes will be estimated by [CONTACT_347192] 0, 5, 9, 
13, 15, 20, 24, and 28. An overall population averaged slope will then be estimated for each 
treatment arm, and standard inference methods will be used to test if the  mean treatment -specific 
slopes are 1) statistically different from 0, and 2) statistically different from each other.  Both slopes will be considered using absolute SIB total scores as well as SIB total scores from baseline 
over Weeks 0 to 28.  
   9.6 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints  
The following exploratory endpoints will be analyzed:  
• Change from baseline in ADCS -ADL -Sev total score at Week 13  and Week 42, for 
subjects who completed week 42

to source data and documentation. 
12.2  Data Management and Data Storage 
Study procedures will be documented on source documents that will be retained at the site(s).  
An Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will produce eCRFs that will be used to collect assessment data for this study.  All study data entered into the eCRF will be compliant with regulatory requirements and 21CFR part 11.  T he system will allow differing levels of access and 
will accommodate roles for the PI , Medical Monitor, CRO, and Sponsor.  All data changes made 
within the system will be subjected to an audit trail.  In compliance with GCP, source documentation supporting the eCRF data should indicate the subject’s participation in the study and should clearly document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, and subject status.  The eCRFs will identify study subjects with unique identifiers.  Data are recorded from the source documents, directly onto the eCRF at the site.   
Electronic CRF data items will undergo quality control standards of operation.  Unresolved 
errors, omissions, or requests for clarification will trigger a query to the Investigational Site for resolution via electronic queries.  The database will be corrected for completeness and accuracy.  
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-[ADDRESS_431487]  (WHO -DRL).  Medical history, concurrent medical 
conditions, and AEs will be coded using MedDRA. 
A quality assurance audit will be conducted to verify the accuracy and completeness of the 
database and will be done prior to declaring database lock.  The database will not be altered afte r 
lock, unless joint written agreement is obtained between the CRO and the Sponsor.

12.4  Retention of Records  
A searchable offline version of the eCRF will be forwarded to the Sponsor for storage.  A copy 
of each completed eCRF will remain in the PI ’s study file on a compact disk.  All source 
documentation, eCRFs and administrative records will be retained by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a minimum of

• The Schedule of Activities has been revised to illustrate the new visit schedule and 
procedures to be performed. 
Protocol sections 4.0 and 9.0: 
Revisions were made to be consistent with the planned statistical analysis.  For the primary 
endpoint analysis, the test of the null hypothesis will be a superiority test based the treatment difference in Week 13 SIB from baseline means as assessed by [CONTACT_347198] (GEE) regression models.  Secondary and exploratory endpoints will be similarly assessed. 
Section 6.1.1: The option to utilize a Pre-Screening Consent Form was added. The purpose of the Pre-
Screening Consent is to allow access to medical records prior to a subject’s onsite screening visit. Use of this consent will reduce the occurrence of onsite screening visits by [CONTACT_347184].  No study procedures will be performed under this preliminary consent.

16.4 Protocol Version 5.0  December 2 0, 2021 
Global changes: The protocol version and date have been updated. 
The protocol previously stated that blood samples will be drawn to measure the presence or 
absence of bryo statin after the initial dose of study drug on Day 0, and again after dosing on Day 
105.  However, the specialized laboratory where the testing was to be done has been unable to 
perform the test with adequate sensitivity.  We have been given approval by [CONTACT_18121], which is a sponsor of the study, to remove the test. The test is not included in any of the planned safety or efficacy analyses.  For this reason, it is no longer necessary to draw blood samples at these two timepoints . The text affected by [CONTACT_347200] 6, Table 1, Schedule of Activities, 
Section [IP_ADDRESS], Laboratory, Section 6.1.2, Week 0, and Section 6.1.11, Week 15. 
The previous version of the protocol stated that patients  who discontinue the study prior to the 
first efficacy assess ment (Week 5, Day 35) will be replaced. The protocol has been revised to 
allow one additional patient  to be added to the study for each patient  who discontinues prior to 
the primary endpoint (Week 28, Day 196). Revised text in Section 9.[ADDRESS_431502] been removed, since no PKC ε samples were 
collected for this trial.

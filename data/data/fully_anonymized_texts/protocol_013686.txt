Sample Size  
The objectives of this Pi[INVESTIGATOR_548950], complete response rate, duration of response, 3-year progression-free and overall survival rates.   The maintenance therapy is considered feasible if more than 70% of the subjects are able to receive a minimum of 4 months of bortezomib therapy (patients able to receive bortezomib but on a reduced dose per protocol would not be considered “unable to tolerate”).  The maintenance therapy is considered not feasible if less than 50% of the subjects are able to tolerate bortezomib therapy.  With the early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], and more than 25/45 tolerating considered a success, this study has 85% power to determine feasibility with a type  I error of 10% and an 84% chance of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_548951] (based on 5000 simulations). A second feasibility marker regarding thalidomide will be also be assessed, but is not the basis of the sample-size and no related interim stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_548952].   To evaluate for feasibility during the study while preventing excess patients from receiving the therapy if it is clearly not feasible,  we will enforce the following:  
 Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_548953] a minimum of 4 months per protocol dose 
modification guidelines will constitute intolerance.    The study will hold accrual, if the following numbers of patients able to tolerate bortezomib are observed (patients accrued will continue therapy per protocol):

If the percent of patients unable to tolerate drops below 50%, accrual may re-start if the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_548955] 25 patients or less (if stopped at 35 patients with 4 months of follow-up, with <=19 able to tolerate, there will be no restart).   The regimen, if feasible, will also be evaluated for its potential to improve three-year progression-free survival. Historical data suggest approximately 52% of the patients are expected to be progression-free at 3 years after autologous stem cell transplant followed by [CONTACT_548963] (Attal et al., Blood Nov 2006; 108 (10), P3289-3294). With 45 patients, there is 81% power to detect an improvement to a 66% 3-year progression-free survival with the proposed 
                                                                           6

10-22-10 maintenance therapy with a one-sided type I error of 10%. This assumes an accrual time of 24 
months, and a minimum follow-up of 36 months. The critical value for 3-year PFS rate is 60%, which, if observed, would suggest that the proposed therapy is a promising new maintenance therapy. This calculation is based on a constant hazard model, and on a parametric exponential estimate.  Criteria for Feasibility
 
If the study accrues to the full 45 patients, the trial will be considered a success on the primary endpoint of feasibility if 26 or more patients tolerated treatment.  If the estimated feasibility rate in the study group is equal to 70% then the 95% confidence interval would range from 57% to 83%.   Analytic Plan
 
The primary endpoint of feasibility will be estimated as a proportion along with the 95% confidence interval for the binomial.  If our accrual goal is met with no premature termination due to significant toxicity, a secondary goal of assessing response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) will be carried out.  Survival estimates will be made using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier, with 95% confidence limits calculated using the logit transformation.   It is hoped that PFS and OS will be further improved with the use of the proposed maintenance therapy.  If the patient discontinues maintenance therapy due to adverse events or personal choice, patient will be taken off protocol.

 3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
3.1 The incidence of multiple myeloma (MM) has been on the rise accounting for 
approximately 10% of all hematological malignancies and 1% of all cancer-related death in Western countries.  Five in 100,000 Americans suffer from MM; the entire spectrum of plasma cell dyscrasias affects an even greater percentage of the population.  These diseases include benign gammopathy, macroglobulinemia, and solitary plasmacytoma and, within the category of MM, smoldering and indolent forms as well as immunoblastic lymphoma and plasma cell leukemia
1.  Adverse 
prognostic factors such as high plasma cell labeling index, elevated beta-[ADDRESS_718600] clinical significance.
2-4 Chemotherapy with melphalan and prednisone, a 
                                                                           10

Version: 08 
10-22-10 combination of alkylating agents, or vincristine, doxorubicin is effective in 50-70% 
of patients with newly diagnosed MM; however, less than 10% of patients will achieve complete remission
5,6.  Unfortunately, the effects of chemotherapy are 
usually short lasting. The median survival of patients with MM is 30-[ADDRESS_718601]
7, or 
utilizing myeloablative therapy followed by [CONTACT_548965] (PBPC).
8
 
3.2 High-dose chemo-/radiotherapy in the treatment of MM. 
 
Single agent high-dose melphalan therapy results in response rates of > 80% with complete response rates of > 30% as described in earlier studies without the use of stem cell support. In a recent update, 1/[ADDRESS_718602] received dose-intense bone marrow ablative therapy followed by [CONTACT_58112], or peripheral stem cell rescue, worldwide
8, 11, 16 A prospective randomized study (IFM90) comparing high-
dose consolidation therapy and stem cell rescue following induction therapy to conventional chemotherapy alone, reported higher complete response rates (22% versus 5%) and improved progression-free and overall survivals with transplant (projected 5 year event-free and overall survivals 28% and 52% versus 10% and 12%).  
17 Comparison of early vs. late (at the time of progression) autologous 
transplants favor early high-dose therapy resulting in prolonged progression-free survival and quality of life while in response.
18 Tandem cycle high-dose 
chemo/radiotherapy in the setting of a total therapy in the largest series by a single 
institution suggested additional benefit associated with the second transplant in a series of 231 patients, independent of the presence of unfavorable cytogenetics and elevated beta 2 microglobulin; with a median follow-up of 4.2 years among surviving patients actuarial 5-year event-free and overall survivals were 42% and 58%, respectively.
19  A recent prospective randomized study by [CONTACT_548966] 
(IFM 94) reported  seven year event-free and overall survival of 20% and 40% respectively with tandem autologous transplant twice the rate obtained with single transplant, suggesting a benefit in favor of tandem autologous transplant.
[ADDRESS_718603] a very good partial response (VGPR) within three months after first autologous transplant.  Furthermore a recent randomized study by [CONTACT_548967].
 42   Overall the benefit from tandem 
autologous transplant remains marginal and majority of the patients still experience recurrent disease.
 
 
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been associated with a disappointing median overall survival of 13 months in a registry review by [CONTACT_548968] 
                                                                           11

10-22-10 for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, with approximately 40% early, 
treatment-related mortality, caused by [INVESTIGATOR_24858]-related toxicities, infections, and acute or chronic graft versus host disease.
[ADDRESS_718604] diminished 
early mortality rates possibly due to incorporation of PBPC reinfusions in addition to ongoing assessment of the role of the so called mini transplants.
21 
Currently early utilization of myeloablative therapy is recommended with autologous stem cell transplantation in order to consolidate complete or partial response to conventional treatment.  In addition, even patients with previously untreated or refractory disease may respond to high-dose therapy, with the possibility of long-term disease control.
8 
 
3.3      Chromosomal abnormalities as prognostic indicators in MM 
Cytogenetic abnormalities can be detected in significant numbers of MM cases; the presence of 11q, -13 and deletion 13q, t (4;14) have been associated with worse survival.
19  Frequent abnormalities observed in MM include t(4;14) (p16;q32), 
t(11;14) (q13;q32), t(8;14) (q24;32), t(14;18) (q32;q21), t (14;16) (q32; q23), 13q14 (Rb loss), chromosome 17 deletion, and others.
 22One of these translocations, 
t(4;14) may lead to dysregulations of two separate oncogenes providing one of many potential targets for specific interventions in the future.
  More recently high 
amplification of chromosome 1q21 has been linked to worse outcome following transplant.
[ADDRESS_718605] autologous stem 
cell transplant was initially studied using alfa-interferon.  This approach was shown to exert anti-myeloma activity but was associated with significant toxicities and no statistical difference in overall survival in a randomized study. 
25 
 
A phase II study conducted at COH investigated the role of maintenance thalidomide after single autologous stem cell transplant.  A total of 29 patients were enrolled. With a median follow up of 27.7 months, estimated 2 year overall survival was 83% and progression free survival was 49%.  At 6 months 45% of patients 
                                                                           12

10-22-10 achieved CR or near CR, suggestive of additional benefits from maintenance 
thalidomide.26 In this study patients with chromosome 13 abnormality had a PFS of 
only 16% despi[INVESTIGATOR_548956].  A randomized study (IFM9902) reported improvement in event free survival with maintenance thalidomide post tandem autologous stem cell transplant with a [ADDRESS_718606] randomization probability of EFS of 52% as compared to 36% in the observation arm and 37% in the pamidronate arm.  They also reported an overall survival advantage in favor of maintenance thalidomide with 4-year post diagnosis probability of survival of 87% versus 77% in the observation arm and 74% in the pamidonate arm. 
[ADDRESS_718607] of chromosome 13 abnormality cannot be overcome by [CONTACT_548969].  A study by [CONTACT_548970] 5 - year EFS with the addition of thalidomide to tandem autologous transplant plan throughout (Total Therapy II) with no difference in OS. 
[ADDRESS_718608] that relapse occurred later on maintenance thalidomide, as OS was similar in the two treatment arms in Total Therapy II.  Furthermore French (IFM9902) study reported a similar post relapse survival in the [ADDRESS_718609] transplant and prednisone was continued till disease progression.  The thalidomide maintenance arm demonstrated superior PFS 
(P=0.0003) and OS (P=0.02) compared to prednisone arm supporting the use of 
maintenance thalidomide post autologous stem cell transplant. 
43
 Based on these results, further studies investigating the potential role of newer anti-myeloma agents such as bortezomib, in combination with dexamethasone and thalidomide as maintenance therapy following autologous stem cell transplantation are warranted especially in patients with adverse prognostic features.  Furthermore, the results of recent studies with bortezomib indicate that response rate, EFS and OS are all independent of chromosomal abnormalities such as chromosome 13 deletion in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma supporting the addition of bortezomib to thalidomide as maintenance therapy in the high risk patients.

10-22-10 -Mechanism of action:  Bortezomib is a first-in-class inhibitor of proteasome 
activity that effectively interrupts the degradation of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.  By [CONTACT_61670] a single molecular target, the proteasome, bortezomib affects multiple signaling pathways.  The anti-neoplastic effect of bortezomib likely involves several distinct mechanisms, including inhibition of cell growth and survival pathways, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of expression of genes that control cellular adhesion, migration and angiogenesis.  Thus, the mechanisms by [CONTACT_548971], and the extent to which each affected pathway is critical to the inhibition of tumor growth could also differ.  Bortezomib has a novel pattern of cytotoxicity in National Cancer Institute (NCI) in vitro and in vivo assays (Adams et al., 1999).  In addition, bortezomib has cytotoxic activity in a variety of xenograft tumor models, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and radiation (Steiner et al., 2001; Teicher et al., 1999; Cusack et al., 2001; LeBlanc et al., 2002; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_149587]., 2002).  Notably, bortezomib induces apoptosis in cells that over express bcl-2, a genetic trait that confers unregulated growth and resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics (McConkey et al., 1999).  Bortezomib is thought to 
be efficacious in multiple myeloma via its inhibition of nuclear factor NB (NF-NB) 
activation, its attenuation of interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated cell growth, a direct 
apoptotic effect, and possibly anti-angiogenic and other effects (Hideshima et al., 2001).   -Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics:  The clinical pharmacology characterization of bortezomib has been determined from phase 1 studies in subjects with solid tumors and hematological malignancies, and confirmed in phase 2 studies in subjects with multiple myeloma. Bortezomib demonstrates multi-compartmental pharmacokinetics. Following intravenous administration of 1.0 mg/m
2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose, the mean first-dose 
maximum observed plasma concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/mL, 
respectively in 11 patients with multiple myeloma and creatinine clearance values 
>50 mL/min participating in a pharmacokinetics study.  In subsequent doses, mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1.0 mg/m
2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose.  The mean elimination 
half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from [ADDRESS_718610] dose.  Mean Total Body Clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m
2 
and 1.3 mg/m2, respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent 
doses for doses of 1.0 and 1.3 mg/m2, respectively.  Clinical experience has shown 
that the change in clearance does not result in overt toxicity from accumulation in this multidose regimen in humans.  In subjects with advanced malignancies, the maximum pharmacodynamic effect (inhibition of 20S activity) occurred within 1-hour post dose.  At the therapeutic dose of 1.3 mg/m
[ADDRESS_718611] dose was approximately 61%.  The time course of proteasome inhibition in subjects is characterized by [CONTACT_91823], followed by [CONTACT_91824] 6 to 24 hours to within 50% of 
                                                                           14

10-22-10 the pretreatment activity.  On the Day 1, 4, 8, and 11 schedule, variable (10%–30%) 
levels of proteasome inhibition have been observed at next scheduled dosing.  In theory, this advantage allows cells to recover proteasome activity for normal cellular housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_91780].  The relationship between bortezomib plasma concentrations and proteasome inhibition can be described by a maximum effect (E
max) model.  The E max curve is initially very steep, with small 
changes in plasma bortezomib concentration over the range of 0.5 to 2.0 ng/mL relating to large increases in the percent inhibition (0–60%).  After that, a plateau occurs where marginal increases of proteasome inhibition are observed in spi[INVESTIGATOR_149589].  .  In a Phase I trial in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies, the MTD for a twice weekly for 4 weeks of a 42 day cycle was 1.04 mg/m
2/dose, with DLTs of thrombocytopenia, 
hyponatremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, and malaise (Orlowski et al., 2002).  The toxicity was greatest during the third and fourth weeks of therapy. In the 3-week schedule of VELCADE monotherapy (4 doses, given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle), the DLT occurred at 1.56 mg/m
2/dose (3 subjects with 
Grade 3 diarrhea and 1 with peripheral sensory neuropathy).  Therefore, the MTD at this schedule was 1.3 mg/m
2/dose.  In a 35-day treatment cycle with 4 weekly doses 
of VELCADE monotherapy, the MTD was 1.6 mg/m2/dose and DLT included 
hypotension, tachycardia, diarrhea, and syncope.  In phase 1 clinical studies, anti-tumor activity was reported in subjects with NHL, multiple myeloma, Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia, squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx, bronchoalveolar carcinoma of the lung, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer. Bortezomib has demonstrated no irreversible adverse effect on hematopoietic stem  cells.

-Clinical Experiences:  Several studies have reported encouraging results using  
bortezomib alone or in combination with dexamethasone in both relapsed/refractory  
multiple myeloma and  previously untreated disease.   The SUMMIT STUDY (The  study of uncontrolled MM managed with proteasome inhibitor therapy) was a  prospective open-label phase II study in 202 patients with relapsed/refractory  multiple myelomas.
29 The median number of previous treatment was 6 with 64% of  
patients having had stem cell transplant and 83% were previously treated with  thalidomide.  The overall response rate of 35% with complete or near complete  response rates of 10%, partial response rate of 18% and minimal response rate of  7%.  The most commonly reported adverse events were GI (such as nausea,  diarrhea, and vomiting), fatigue, transient thromocytopnia (40%) and peripheral  neuropathy (31%).  A phase III randomized study, APEX TRIAL (The Assessment  of Proteasome Inhibition of Extending Remission) compared bortezomib with high  dose dexamethasone in 669 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma  with one to three previous treatments.
30 In this study bortezomib was administered  
at 1.3mg/m2 on day 1, 4, 8, and 11 for eight five-week cycles, followed by [CONTACT_548972] 1, 8, 15, and 22 for three  five-week cycles. The dexamethasone  arm of the trial was stopped after a preplanned interim analysis revealed significant  clinical benefits in survival and time to disease progression for patients receiving  bortezomib.  Significant activity in previously untreated patients with  
                                                                           15

10-22-10 multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib has also been reported.  A phase II  
study of bortezomib alone and in combination with dexamethasone in 32 previously  untreated patients reported an overall response rate of 88% with CR + nCR rate of  20%.  The most common adverse events were sensory neuropathy (31%),  constipation (28%), myalgia (13%), and neutropenia (13%).
31  Another phase II  
study of bortezomib in high risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma was conducted  by [CONTACT_64850] (E2A02).  High risk patients were  defined B2 – microglobulin levels of >
 5.5mg/L, ch13q deletion or plasma cell  
labeling index >  1.  Patients received induction treatment with bortezomib  
1.3mg/m2  on day 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 21 days for 8 cycles.  After induction,  
patients were scheduled to receive bortezomib 1.3mg/m2 every other week  
indefinitely.  Alternatively, eligible patients could undergo PBSC mobilization after  4 cycles.  In patients with progressive disease during maintenance treatment, the  induction was repeated.  A total of 44 patients were enrolled.  Preliminary data were  presented in 19 patients, 13 patients (68.4%) achieved a partial response.  One of 2  evaluable patients with deletion 13q, 6 of 8 evaluable patients with LI >
 1 and 11 of  
15 evaluable patients with B2 - microglobulin >   5.5 mg/L achieved a partial

     4.1.2   Thalidomide
 
 
Mechanism of action of thalidomide is not fully understood.  In multiple myeloma, thalidomide has been shown to block different pathways for disease progression. In addition to anti-angiogenic properties, thalidomide also possesses immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Thalidomide reduces production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin6 (IL-6), a growth factor for proliferation of myeloma cells, by [CONTACT_241667]. 
40 
This drug can modulate the expression of cell surface adhesion molecules like TNF-alpha, ICAM- 1 and VCAM 1. Thalidomide also generates apoptotic signals through activating capspase-8 mediated cell death, promoting c-jun terminal kinase (JNK) which leads to increased permeability of mitochondrial pores, and increasing production of pro-apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome C and second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspase (Smac).  In addition, thalidomide modulates host immune response by [CONTACT_548973] (NK) cells through increased production of IL-[ADDRESS_718616] of thalidomide. S.T.E.P.S (System for Thalidomide and Prescribing Safety) program has been designed to minimize the 
chance of fetal exposure to thalidomide. Under this program, women of 
childbearing age are monitored for pregnancy, and both male and female patients are instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse or to use highly effective contraceptive methods. 
 
The incidence of toxicities with thalidomide usually correlates with the dose of the drug. Patients usually tolerate doses of 200 mg/day or less well and experience more side effects with higher doses. Incidence of certain toxicities such as constipation and sedation decreases with time, whereas incidence of peripheral neuropathy and hypothyroidism increases in frequency. Somnolence (~75%), constipation (~85%), xerostomia (~10%), tremors (~35%), skin rash (~45%), and neutropenia (15-25%) are the most common side effects of thalidomide. Severe incidence of somnolence (~5-10%), constipation (~5%), and peripheral neuropathy (~3-5%) has been reported in less than 10% of patients. Less common side effects of thalidomide include: bradycardia (~25%), peripheral edema (~15%), anasarca (~3%), ataxia (~15%), hearing loss (~3%), Steven- Johnson syndrome (<3%), and headaches (~10%). Although rare, seizures, confusion, impotence, elevation of liver enzymes, hypothyroidism, menstrual irregularities, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia have also been reported. Peripheral neuropathy can occur in about 
                                                                           20 
Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] 
Version: 08 
10-22-10 80% of patients, with grade 3-4 neuropathy occurring in about 3-5% of all patients. 
This side effect usually occurs after 6 months of therapy. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are serious side effects occurring in ~ 1-3% of patients receiving single-agent thalidomide. The incidence of thrombosis can climb to 15-25% when thalidomide is added to standard chemotherapy. Use of prophylactic low-molecular weight heparin, warfarin, and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_548958].  Currently they are recommended during induction treatment with combination of thalidomide and dexamethasone when tumor burden is high.  The incidence of DVT during maintenance therapy with thalidomide post autologous stem cell transplant has not been reported to be high 
27 
and role of DVT prophylaxis in this setting remains to be determined.  Therefore no anticoagulation therapy will be used during maintenance therapy in this study.

The neurotoxicity-directed questionnaire (see FACT/GOG- Neurotoxicity Questionnaire, Version 
4, Appendix 18.1) is a useful tool for determining the presence and intensity of neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy from the patient’s perspective.  Neuropathic symptoms are more prominent than abnormalities on the clinical examination.  After the patient completes the neurotoxicity-directed questionnaire, the questionnaire should be reviewed to assist with the evaluation of the onset and intensity of peripheral neuropathy and other neurotoxicities that may possibly require intervention or dose modification.

                           12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1 Sample Size  
The objectives of this Phase II study are to evaluate the feasibility and toxicities of maintenance therapy, complete response rate, duration of response, 3-year progression-free and overall survival rates.  
 
The maintenance therapy is considered feasible if more than 70% of the subjects are able to receive a minimum of 4 months of bortezomib therapy (patients able to receive bortezomib but on a reduced dose per protocol would not be considered “unable to tolerate”).  The maintenance therapy is considered not feasible if less than 50% of the subjects are able to tolerate bortezomib therapy.  With the early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], and more than 25/45 tolerating considered a success, this study has 85% power to determine feasibility with a type I error of 10% and an 84% chance of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_548951] (based on 5000 simulations). A second feasibility marker regarding thalidomide will be also be assessed, but is not the basis of the sample-size and no related interim stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_548952].  
 
To evaluate for feasibility during the study while preventing excess patients from receiving the therapy if it is clearly not feasible, we will enforce the following:  
 
                                                                           31 
Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] 
Version: 08 
10-22-10 12.2 Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_548961] a minimum of 4 months per protocol 
dose modification guidelines will constitute intolerance.  The study will hold 
accrual, if the following numbers of patients able to tolerate bortezomib are observed (patients accrued will continue therapy per protocol): 
     Patients with 4                                    Stop if the Number Able to   Months Follow-up
                        Tolerate Bortezomib is:  
                5                                                0                 15                                                <=8                 25                                               <=13                 35                                                <=[ADDRESS_718632] that several patients may be undergoing maintenance therapy when the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_548954], the following rule is to be followed: If after a hold on study accrual, the percent of patients unable to tolerate maintenance therapy remains above 50%, the study will not re-open. If the percent of patients unable to tolerate drops below 50%, accrual may re-start if the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_548955] 25 patients or less (if stopped at 35 patients with 4 months of followup, with <=19 able to tolerate, there will be no restart).  
 
The regimen, if feasible, will also be evaluated for its potential to improve three-year progression-free survival. Historical data suggest approximately 52% of the patients are expected to be progression-free at 3 years after autologous stem cell 
transplant followed by [CONTACT_548963] (Attal et al., Blood Nov 2006; 108 
(10), P3289-3294). With 45 patients, there is 81% power to detect an improvement to a 66% 3-year progression-free survival with the proposed maintenance therapy with a one-sided type I error of 10%. This assumes an accrual time of 24 months, and a minimum follow-up of 36 months. The critical value for 3-year PFS rate is 60%, which, if observed, would suggest that the proposed therapy is a promising new maintenance therapy. This calculation is based on a constant hazard model, and on a parametric exponential estimate.  
12.3 Criteria for Feasibility 
 
If the study accrues to the full 45 patients, the trial will be considered a success on the primary endpoint of feasibility if 26 or more patients tolerated treatment.  If the estimated feasibility rate in the study group is equal to 70% then the 95% confidence interval would range from 57% to 83%.  
 
12.4 Analytic Plan 
 
                                                                           32 
Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] 
Version: 08 
10-22-10 The primary endpoint of feasibility will be estimated as a proportion along with the 
95% confidence interval for the binomial.  If our accrual goal is met with no premature termination due to significant toxicity, a secondary goal of assessing response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) will be carried out.  Survival estimates will be made using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier, with 95% confidence limits calculated using the logit transformation.   It is hoped that PFS and OS will be further improved with the use of the proposed maintenance therapy.  If the patient discontinues maintenance therapy due to disease progression or personal choice, patient will be taken off protocol. Patients who discontinue maintenance treatment due to toxicities will remain on the study and will be followed for the study endpoints including disease response, PFS and overall survival. We will summarize the duration and the dose of boretzomib therapy and the duration and the dose of sequential thalidomide therapy.

This is a Risk Level 3 study, as defined in the “Guidance, Policy and Procedures for Data and Safety Monitoring for In-House Trials at City of Hope”, http://www.infosci.coh.org/ocrqa/forms/guidance.doc
 
because it is a phase II clinical trial where the risks are at least balanced by [CONTACT_548986]. 
 
B) Monitoring and Personnel Responsible for Monitoring 
The Protocol Management Team (PMT) consisting of the PI, Collaborating Investigator, 
CRA, protocol nurse, and statistician is responsible for monitoring the data and safety of this 
study, including implementation of any stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_36887].  
Data and safety will be reported to the C OH DSMB.  Protocol specific data collection will 
include toxicities >
 grade [ADDRESS_718635] 5 patients were enrolled and then after every 10 patients enrolled using the PMT report. 
16.0      DEFINITIONS  
A. Adverse Event Definition:  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a 
pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the drug, whether or not it is considered to be drug related.  This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the 
administration of drug. 
                                                                           34 
Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] 
Version: 08 
10-22-10 B. Serious Adverse Event Definition 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless 
of causality that: 
xResults in death . 
xIs life-threatening.  Life-threatening means that the patient was at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically 
might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. 
xRequires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (eg, surgery performed earlier than planned). 
xResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a persons’ ability to conduct normal life functions. 
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
xIs an important medical event .  An important medical event is an event that may not 
result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124495], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.   
Clarification should be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” since they ARE 
NOT synonymous.  The term “severe” is often used to describe the inten sity (severity) of a 
specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache).  This is NOT the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above and are usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  A severe adverse event does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, persistent nausea of several hours duration may be considered severe nausea but not an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke resulting in only a minor degree of disability may be considered mild, but would be defined as an SAE based 
on the above noted criteria.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations. 
C. Procedures for AE and SAE Reporting 
Investigator-sponsor must report all serious adverse event (SAE) regardless of relationship 
with any study drug or expectedness to the COH DSMB and IRB and Millennium as soon as possible, but no later than 5 calendar days of the investigator-sponsor’s observation or awareness of the event.  All sub-investigators must report all SAEs to the investigator-
                                                                           35

10-22-10 sponsor so that the investigator-sponsor can meet his/her foregoing reporting obligations to 
Millennium.  
SAE Reporting to COH :  Adverse events must be reported to the 
COH DSMB and IRB according to definitions and guidelines at 
http://www.infosci.coh.org/ocrqa/forms/guidance.doc  and 
http://resadmin.coh.org/doc/irb3810.doc , which are defined below.  
AEs will be monitored by [CONTACT_36925].  Less than serious adverse events will be reported only at the time of protocol continuation reports. 
Investigator-sponsor must also provide Millennium with a copy of all communications 
related to the Study or Drug with the applicable regulatory authority, including, but not 
limited to, telephone conversation logs, as soon as possible but no later than 5 calendar 
days of that communication.  
Millennium’s Product Safety Department will send to the investigator-sponsor a monthly 
listing of the SAE reports received for SAE verification.  Investigator-sponsor will be responsible for forwarding such reports to any sub-investigator(s) and providing any 
follow-up safety information requested by [CONTACT_20555].

For both serious and non-serious adverse events, the investigator or sub-investigator must 
determine both the intensity of the event and the relationship of the event to drug administration. Relationship  to drug administration will be determined by [CONTACT_9940]-investigator 
responding yes or no to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the adverse event is 
associated with the drug? 
Intensity for each adverse event, including any lab abnormality, will be determined by [CONTACT_548987], version 3.0, as a guideline, wherever possible.  The criteria are available online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
.

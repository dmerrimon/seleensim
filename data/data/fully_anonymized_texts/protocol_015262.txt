2/Statistical Analy sis Plan WA29767STATISTICA L ANAL YSIS PLAN AMENDMENT RATIONA LE
The Statistical Analysis Plan W A2976 7 Version 2 was amended as follows:
Section 2.2.2 (Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measures):  Change from b aseline in 
mRSS and FVC at W eek24 were listed as exploratory endpoints in the protocol.  
However, the analysis of these endpoints is part of the multipl icity testing procedure 
and the resulting P-values will not be considered exploratory.  The mRSS and FVC 
at Week48 are key endpoints, and showing a treatment effect following 24 weeks of 
treatment is considered important.
Section 3.2.1 (Definition of SSc-related Complications):  For SSc -related 
complications clarified that these are adverse events that are adjudicated 
independently by [CONTACT_68157].
Section 4.6.1 (Controlling for Type 1 Error):  Changed the order of secondary 
endp oints in the multiplicity hierarchy 
Section: [IP_ADDRESS] (Time to Treatment Failure):  Clarified that time to an event will be 
relative to first dose of study drug, rather than date of randomisation as specified in 
the protocol since only treatment emergent adverse events are being adjudicated.  
Defined censoring for the analysis (previously omitted).
For events deemed SSc -related complications only serious events will be included 
in the time to treatment failure endpoint.  Although non serious Grade 3 and 4 
events are also being adjudicated, the information made available on these events 
to the adjudication committee is limited to eCRF data as detailed patient narratives 
are not available for non -serious events.
Included time to event analysis of the componen ts of time to treatment failure.
Defined a sensitivity analysis of time to treatment failure where discontinuation from 
study for the following reasons will also be classed as a treatment failure: death, 
lack of efficacy, lost to follow up, withdrawal by s ubject, physician decision (whereas 
withdrawal from study for the following reasons will not be counted as an event: 
adverse event, pregnancy, protocol violation, non -compliance, study terminated by 
[CONTACT_2728], other).
Clarified that Serious SSc -related compl ications will be summarised by [CONTACT_29974] (SOC), and will be further subcategorised descriptively for assessment 
of internal organ involvement (including, but not limited to, cardiac disease, renal 
disease, and GI disease).
Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Binary Endpoints) :  For the binary endpoints of ≥20%, 40%, and 
60% improvement in mRSS at Week 48, there will be an additional analysis 
whereby [CONTACT_68158] -modulation therapy (e.g., 
DMARDs and/or Biologics) will be censored so tha t these patients will become non 
responders in the analysis.
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
3/Statistical Analy sis Plan WA29767Section [IP_ADDRESS](Sensitivity to Primary Estimand):  Added details of a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_68131], and expanded on details of the pattern mixture 
model to allow programming of this analysis to be clear from the SAP text. As a 
sensitivity to the primary estimand ,a linear regression analysis (with Huber White 
sandwich errors) of change from baseline in mRSS at Week48 is added.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Sensitivity to Secondary Endpoints):  Added tippi[INVESTIGATOR_68132] .
Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 (Subgroup Analyses):  Added further subgroup analyses for 
additional disease characteristics and baseline demography; namely baseline 
mRSS, sex, age, race, and region.
Removed Appendix 3: Details of date imputations will be included in the 
programming documentation
Appendix 10:  Added detai ls of the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test for difference in 
proportions .
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.

7/Statistical Analy sis Plan WA297671. BACKGROUND
This document describes the statistical methods to be used for the analysis of the 
clinical efficacy, clinical safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) data 
from the Phase III Study W A29767 (FocuSSced).  The study drug tocilizumab 
(TCZ, RO487 7533) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed against 
the human interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor.  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic 
sclerosis (SSc) have been linked to the effects of IL -6 on cell proliferation.
Study W A29767 is a multice nter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, two -arm, 
parallel -group trial in patients with SSc.  There is a 48- week blinded period followed by a 
48-week open -label period.
The primary endpoint is the difference in the change in modified Rodnan skin score 
(mRSS) from baseline at W eek48.
This document only describes the statistical methods and analyses used in the reporting 
of the double- blind phase of the study, up to Week48.  The analysis of biomarkers, 
including skin biopsies, will be covered in a separate document.  The exploratory data 
analysis up to W eek96 will be described in a separate analysis plan.
2. STUDY DESIGN
This Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, two -arm, 
parallel -group study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of TCZ in patients with 
SSc.  The study consists of two periods:  a 48 -week, double- blind, placebo -controlled 
period, followed by a 48-week open -label treatment period.  Patients will be randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to receive SC injectio ns of 162 mg of TCZ QW  (once weekly) or placebo 
QW for [ADDRESS_74295] dose of open -label treatment at W eek48.  
Approximately 21 0patients will be enrolled at approximately 75 global sites.  The study 
design is presented schematically in Figure 1.

2.2.[ADDRESS_74297] outcome measures for this study are as follows:
Predose observed serum TCZ concentration at baseline and at specified timepoints 
thereafter (C trough).
Correlation between PK parameters (e.g. , Ctrough) for TCZ and efficacy (e.g., mRSS 
or any positively trending efficacy outcome noted in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 , safety 
(CTC grades for neutrophils, platelets, ALT, and AST, or any negatively trending 
safety outcome noted in Section 2.2.7 ), or immunogenicity outcome measures, as 
relevant.  C troughmay be categorized into exposure bins (e.g., high, medium ,and low) 
to assist in identifying trends.
2.2.5 Pharmacody namic Outcome Measures
The PD outcome measures for this study are as follows:
Serum sIL -6R, IL -6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein 
(CRP) levels predose at baseline and at subsequent time points after initiation of 
study drug .

Frequency of d eaths
Incidence of specific laborato ry abnormalities
Change from baseline in digital ulcer count
Frequency of SSc-related complications as determined by [CONTACT_68160]
2.3 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE
A sample size of approximately 1 05patients in the TCZ group and 1 05patients in the 
placebo group (a total of 210 patients) will give power in the range of 75% to 80%, 
(allowing for an estimated patient dropout rate of approximately 15% to 20%) to detect 
abetween -group difference of 3.55 units (common standard deviation of 8.43) in mean 
change in mRSS from baseline to Week48 using a two -group t -test, with a
5%two-sided significance level .  The minimal detectable difference (smallest treatment 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
11/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767difference that would give a statistically significant result) under these ass umptions, and 
with a patient dropout rate of 20%, is approximately 2.6.
The loss of power at Week 48 due to performing a futility analysis based on mRSS at 
Week24 (see Section 4.12) on a subset of patients was minimal ,at approximately 3% 
based on simulat ions.
The following power calculations for key secondary endpoints use the maximum 
available alpha according to the multiplicity procedure ( Section 4.6.1 ).
The required sample size of 210 patients based on the primary endpoint, gives 9 4% 
power for change f rom baseline in percent predicted FVC at week 48 at the 4% two -
sided significance level , assuming 15% dropout (mean difference 0.043, common 
standard deviation 0.075, Wilcoxon Mann Whitney two sample test).
Assuming 70% of patients on TCZ are event free at 48weeks of follow up, 50% of 
patients event free on placebo ( hazard ratio[HR] 0.52) gives a power of 80% at the 
two-sided 4.5% significance level for the time to treatmen t failure endpoint based on 
210patients with 15% dropout at 48 weeks.
Under the same assumptions for number of patients and dropouts the power for the 
change from baseline in HAQ -DIatWeek48 is 65% using a two -group t-testat the 
two-sided 5% significance level (mean difference 0.181, co mmon standard deviation 
0.517).
2.[ADDRESS_74299] patient has either withdrawn or 
completed his or her W eek48 visit, and will be based on cleaned data for all patients up 
to and inclusive of their W eek48 assessment date, as well as safety follow -updata for 
patients that withdrew prior to Week48.  A Week48 Clinical Study Report (CSR) based 
on these analyses will be produced.
There will be a final analysis and CSR when all patients have reached the end of the 
open -label period (W eek96) of the study and/or have completed their safety follow -up
visits.  The analyses for W eek96 data will be covered in a separate Statistical Analysis 
Plan.
3. STUDY CONDUCT
3.1 RANDOMIZA TION ISSUES
At baseline, patients will be randomized (stratified by [CONTACT_8668]-6 level ( 10;10 pg/mL) at 
screening )to study drug assignment and assigned randomization and study drug 
assignment numbers through an interactive voice /web response system (IxRS).  
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 162 mg of subcutaneous (SC) 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
12/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767TCZ weekly ( QW) (Group A) or SC placebo QW  (Group B) for [ADDRESS_74300] patient being enrolled into the study.  In 
addition, the independent data coordinating center ( iDCC) will review I xRS data as part 
of the independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) preparation.
3.[ADDRESS_74301] two times 
per year.  Analyses required for the iDMC’s data review will be performed as described 
in the iDMC Charter.
A review for safety will be performed at the same time as the futility analysis when 
approximately [ADDRESS_74302] completed 24 weeks of treatment (s ee Protocol 
Section 6.9).
3.2.1 Definition of SSc -Related Complications
A Clinical Adjudication Committee (AC), an independent and blinded expert clinician 
panel, adjudicated serious AEs and Grade [ADDRESS_74303] to their classification 
as SSc- related co mplications. Serious AEs only (not Grade 3 and 4 events that are 
without patient narratives) positively adjudicated as SSC -related complications will be 
used for the analysis of time to treatment failure.
These adjudication decisions are captured in the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ), 
and the review of these adverse events will be completed before study unblinding. Full
details of the adjudication committee process have been documented in a charter which 
will be made available .
4. STATISTICA L METHODS
4.1 ANAL YSIS POPULA TIONS
Disposition summaries will be based on the All Patients population. Analysis of safety 
data will be based on the safety population. The primary analysis population for efficacy 
will be the intention to treat (ITT)population .
4.1.1 All Pat ients
The All Patients population will include all subjects randomized in the study.
4.1.2 Intent -to-Treat Population
The ITT (intent -to-treat) population will be a modified ITT and include all subjects 
randomized in the study who received any study drug. The t reatment group for this 
population will be defined according to the treatment assigned at randomization by I xRS.

date, minus the date of first injection of study drug ,plus [ADDRESS_74306] injection of study drug, plus 1 day.
Compliance will be summarized by [CONTACT_68161] (the number of doses actually received 
divided by [CONTACT_68162]), the cumulative dose, and the number of 
patients with missed doses.
The number and frequency of patients first receiving immun o-modulating treatments 
(e.g.,disease- modifying anti -rheumatic drugs [ DMARDS ]) will be summarized by [CONTACT_68163]48(refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
A listing of the number of patients in each treatment group that were randomized 
according to an incorrect stratification value given at baseline will be produced at 
Week48 (IxRSdata will be compared to the clinical database).
A listing of patients with major protocol deviations including those that entered the study 
without meet ingall inclusion/exclusion entry criteria will be produced.

14/Statistical Analysis Plan WA297674.3 ANAL YSIS OF TREATMEN T GROUP COMPA RABILIT Y
To descriptively assess the comparability of tre atment arms (placebo versus TCZ 
162mg SC) at baseline, summary tables will be produced for the safety population for 
clinically important baseline demographic and disease characteristics by [CONTACT_21748].  If it is found that there is a large differe nce in the number of patients in the 
safety population compared to the ITT population, additional summaries will be produced 
as randomized.
These summary tables will include number of patients, mean, standard deviation, and 
median for continuous demographi c/disease characteristics and number and percentage 
of patients for categorical characteristics.
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics will be summarized as described in 
the following sections.

The number of patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg )and hepatitis C 
antibody ( anti-HCV )at screening will be summarized for the safety population.
Medical history data, including surgery and procedures and baseline conditions, will be 
summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_68164]. Descriptive 
summaries of any previous and concomitant treatment will be produced by [CONTACT_6490]. A glossary showing the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_68133]48.
4.[ADDRESS_74307] injection of study treatment will be designated study 
day1.  Each subsequent assessment point will be assigned a study day calculated as 
(date of assessment date of fir st injection of study treatment) 1.
Efficacy datasets will be cut at the Week48 exposure date plus 28 days. The exposure 
date will be the date of the Week48 study drug injection, identified as the injection that 
occurs within the protocol time window of 337 (/7 days). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this will be the first 
open label dose. If more than one injection occurs in the time window then the study 
day of the earliest open label drug will be used, or, if there is no open label dose in the 
time window, the day of the latest injection in the window will be used. If the W eek48 
study drug injection is missing the data sets will be cut at study day [ADDRESS_74308] dose of open label treatment, whichever is later .If the Week48 
exposure date is missing, the data will be cut at study day 337. All data including data 
collected in safety follow -up visits or spontaneously reported AEs will be included in 
safety summaries .
There will also be a final analysis of all available data including all visits up to Week96 
and the 8 weeks of safety follow -up, which will be described in a separate analysis plan .
4.5 VISIT WINDOWS
All patient assessments within the cut efficacy datasets that are collected by [CONTACT_68165] a study week using the actual study day of the assessment; this 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
16/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767includes withdrawal visits and any unscheduled visits. Time windows will be continuous 
from the midpoint between two consecutive study visits to the next midpoint, and will be 
dependent on the schedule of assessments (as given in Appendix 2, Appendix 3, and 
Appendix 4)for each variable independently. An example table of time windowing for 
the mRSS and FVC is shown below (Table 1 ). Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_68134]. Data will never be mapped to v isits for which the 
assessment was not scheduled in the Protocol.

*Except for FVC, HRCT and DLco, where the upper bound of week 48 is the cut date, 
i.e. week 48 exposure + [ADDRESS_74309] within 4weeks of the initial assessment, therefore for FVC (and HRCT, DLco) 
all data within the cut (Week 48 exposure plus 28 days) will be mapped to W eek48. 
Anyefficacy assessments that occurred after the study day of first open label dose that 
is used in the analysis or summary tables will be flagged in the relevant listing.
For all efficacy assessments except for mRSS, if more than one particular efficacy 
assessment occurs within the same time window, then the nearest non -missing 
assessment to the nominal time point will be assigned to that visit.  If th ere are two (or
more) efficacy assessments that occur the same time away from the nominal time point, 
then the latest assessment will be assigned to that visit.  For multiple mRSS 
assessments that occur within the same time window, in order to account for repeated 
assessments to allow assessor consistency the latest assessment within a time window 
will be used.

assessment will be used.
If more than one particular safety ass essment (e.g.,laboratory result or vital sign) occurs 
within the same time window then the worst value will be assigned to the visit. The last 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
17/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767value from screening will be used for baseline assessments of safety if there is no 
baseline ( study day1) val ue.
For summaries of data not collected by [CONTACT_765] ,such as AEs, medical history, and 
concomitant medications, all data in the Week48 saf ety data cut will be included.
4.6 EFFICA CY ANAL YSIS
4.6.1 Controlling for Type 1 Error
The following diagram shows the order and weighting applied to the testing of the key 
clinical endpoints, including primary, secondary and some exploratory endpoints.  This 
roll-back approach will preserve the overall type I error of 5%.  Please note that no 
adjustment to the alpha level for mRSS at Week24 will be made to account for the 
futility analysis (Section 4.12).
Assuming the primary efficacy endpoint is significant at the 5% level, then percent 
predicted FVC (ppFVC) will be weighted at 0.8 and will hence be tested at a 4% alpha.  
Both time to treatment failure and HAQ -DI will be weighted at 0.1 so that if ppFVC fails 
to meet significance at the 4% level, each can still be tested at a minimum of 0.5% 
significance level ( 0.005).  If ppFVC is significant , then the alpha will be transferr ed to 
the time to treatment failure endpoint which can then be tested at a 4.5% alpha.  If 
ppFVC and time to treatment failure are significant at the 4% and 4.5% alpha 
respectively, then the alpha will be passed to the HAQ -DI hypothesis and HAQ -DI will be 
tested at an alpha of 5%.  If ppFVC is not significant, but time to treatment failure is, the 
0.5% alpha can be transferred to HAQ -DI which can then be tested at the 1% level.  If 
the time to treatment failure endpoint is not significant then HAQ -DI will b e tested at an 
alpha level of 0.5%.

Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
18/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767If HAQ -DI is significant at the acquired significance level then the other secondary 
endpoints listed below HAQ -DI will be tested in order at the alpha level passed down by 
[CONTACT_53820] -DI.If the endpoint being tested is non -significant at the acquired significance level 
then that end point and those below in the hierarchy will be non -significant, although 
p-values will still be produced. If HAQ -DI is non -significant, none of the subsequent 
secondary endpoints will be claimed f or statistical significance and instead descriptive 
p-values will be presented.
If the primary endpoint i s not significant at the 5% level the testing will stop.
4.6.[ADDRESS_74310] for the primary analysis is the difference between treatment
arms in the mean change in the mRSS at W eek48 for the ITT population in the 
regimens as actually taken. The study has been designed to continue to capture 
efficacy data on patients who discontinue study drug prematurely and may receive 
additional immuno -modulating treatments (e.g., DMARDs) and in patients who receive 
escape therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (i.e., immun o-modulating treatment in addition to study drug) during 
the double -blind treatment period.   All data will be included in the primary analysis. The 
primary analysis specified above assumes a missing -at-random missing -data
mechanism whereby [CONTACT_68166] -upfrom the TCZ arm will tend to 
have similar efficacy to that of patients on TCZ who remained in the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Modified Rodnan Skin Score
The mRSS is a measure of skin thickness across 17 different body sites and has a 
range of 0 to 51 in whole units (see Protocol S ection 4.5.9 for further details). There will 
be no imputation of missing data prior to the anal ysis detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and the 
total scores as collected in the site electronic device will be used, rather than derived 
total scores. All missing assessments will be adjusted for within the model fitting 
process.
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical A nalysis
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in mRSS from baseline at Week 48.  The 
mean change from baseline will be analyzed using a r estricted maximum 
likelihood -based repeated measures approach.  The analysis will include the fixed, 
categorical effects for treatment, visit, the stratification factor IL -6 level (10;≥10pg/mL) 
at screening , IL-6level at screening -by-visit interaction, and treatment -by-visit 
interactio n, as well as the continuous covariates of baseline mRSS score and baseline 
mRSS score –by–visit interaction.  Analyses will be implemented in SASusing 
PROC MIXED.  An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -
patient errors.  The Kenward –Roger approximation ( Kenward and Roger 1997 ) will be 
used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom.
The primary treatment comparison will be the contrast between treatments at the 
Week48 timepoint.  Least square means, along with a difference in means, a 95% CI for 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
19/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767the difference in means, and the p-valuewill be reported.  The significance test will be 
based on a two- sided 0.05.
[IP_ADDRESS] Stratification Factors
Efficacy analyses will adjust for the stratification factor at randomization, which is the 
categorical variable IL-6level ( 10;10pg/mL) at screening.   Data from the I xRS used 
for the randomizat ion, not the actual value of IL-6at screening, will be used.
4.6.3 Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints
Further details on the definition of secondary endpoints are provided in Section 6.4.2 of 
the Protocol.
[IP_ADDRESS] Continuous Endpoints
For all continuous secondary endpoints, except for FVC, the primary method of analysis 
for change from baseline will be a repeated measures model to compare the treatment 
effect at Week48, as described above in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Least square means, along with a difference in means, a 95% CI for the difference in 
means, and the p-value will be reported at W eek48.
The least square means of the change from baseline by [CONTACT_68167], along with 95% CIs will be plotted and tabulated 
by [CONTACT_68168] W eek48.
No imputation will be made for missing assessments prior to analyses.  All missing data 
will be adjusted for within the model fitting process where applicable.
The primary method of analysis for change from baseline in FVC endpoints will be a 
non-parametric analysis method based on the expectation that the distribution of data 
will be non
-normal.  Change from baseline to W eek 48 in percent predicted 
FVC (ppFVC) will be analyzed using a Van Elteren test stratified by [CONTACT_68169]-6level 
(10; 10pg/mL).  The median change from baseline for each treatment group and the 
corresponding 95% CI for the median will be presented for ppFVC, along with the Van 
Elteren p -value.  A cumulative distri bution plot will be produced for both FVC endpoints 
(absolute and percent predicted).
The median change from baseline, along with 95% CIs will be summarized and plotted 
by [CONTACT_68168] W eek48.
Additional parametric analyses consistent with the method used for other secondary 
endpoints will also be conducted for the FVC.
Forced Vital Capacity (FVC):
Percent predicted FVC and change from baseline in percent predicted FVC will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_765]. The predicted FVC is derived using height (ht) in (cm) at s creening, 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
20/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767age at screening, sex ,and race (Caucasian, Mexican American ,and African American). 
An example calculation is given below ( Hankinson et al. 1999 ).

For Asian and Asian -American patients , a correction factor of 0.88 is applied (Hankinson 
et al. 2010 ).  A plot of the mean change from baseline by [CONTACT_68170] W eek 48.
HAQ-DI:
The HAQ -DI is a 20 -item, validated questionnaire used to assess difficulty in performing 
activities of daily living .  The HAQ -DI assesses eight domains of physical functioning: 
Dressing and Grooming (2 items), Hygiene (3 items), Arising (2 items), Reach (2 items), 
Eating (3items), Grip (3 items), W alking (2 items), Common Daily Activities (3 items). 
The questions assess usual abilities ranging from 0 “without any d ifficulty” to 3 “unable to 
do.”  A negative change from baseline indicates improvement .  The Minim al Clinically 
Important Difference (MCID) for improvement ranges from 0.14 0.22 ( Khanna et 
al.2006 ; Pope 2011 ).
The total HAQ -DI score will be calculated according to the developer’s scoring algorithm 
(see Appendix 5for details).
Patients in Japan were administered the Japanese version of the HAQ -DI, known at the 
J-HAQ.  The two questionnaires contain the same evaluation components and are 
comparable.  The pain VAS aspect of the HAQ -DI (whi ch is not part of J -HAQ) was not 
implemented for this study and therefore HAQ -DI and J -HAQ will be combined for 
analysis.
HAQ -DI will also be summarized descriptively as a binary endpoint based on the 
proportion of patients achieving an improvement from ba seline 0.22.
Patient Global A ssessment :
The Patient’s Global Assessment represents the patient’s overall assessment of his or 
her current SSc status on a 100 mm horizontal VAS.  The extreme left end of the scale 
indicates “has no effect at all” (symptom free), and the extreme right end indicates “worst 
possible effect”.  A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. The MCID 
has been reported by [CONTACT_68171] 2010 to be 6.70.
PhysicianGlobal A ssessment : 
The Physician Global Ass essment represents the clinician’s overall assessment of the 
patient’s current SSc status on a 100 mm horizontal VAS .The extreme left end of the 
scale indicates “has no effect at all” (symptom free), and the extreme right end indicates 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
21/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767“worst possible effect” .  Higher scores indicate worse disease in terms of severity, 
damage, or overall disease, but there is no standardization for the scale ( Pope 2011 ).  
Anegative change from baseline indicates improvement.   Expert consensus has 
suggested a range of 813units for the MCID ( Gazi et al. 2007 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Time to Treatment Failure
Time to treatment failure was previously defined in the protocol as the time from 
randomization to the time of first: 
death
decline in percent predicted FVC >10% relative to baseline
increase in mRSS 20% and an increase in mRSS of 5 points relative to baseline
occurrence of a predefined SSc -related complication as adjudicated by [CONTACT_68172], during the W eek48 double -blind treatment period.
However, specifically, time to an event will be relative to first dose of study drug, rather 
than date of randomisation as only treatment emergent AEs were adjudicated, and as 
described in Section 3.2.1 , for events deemed SSc -related com plications only serious 
events will be included in the time to treatment failure endpoint.
Time to treatment failure will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier curves and 
the median, 25 th, and 75 thpercentiles (where possible) and 95% CI for the median.  
The treatment groups will be compared using a Cox proportional hazards model 
adjusting for the stratification factor applied at randomization. A 95% CI for the HRand 
a p-value will be produced. Data from patients who discontinue from the study prio r to 
Week48 will be censored from the study day after the discontinuation date. Data post 
initiation of immuno -modulation therapy (e.g. ,DMARDs and/or Biologics) and/or data 
collected after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_68135].
These analyses will be repeated, where appropriate, for the individual components of 
time to treatment failure; namely death, decline in percent predicted FVC 10% relative 
to baseline, relative increase in mRSS 20%,and an increase in mRSS of 5 points, or 
occurrence of a predefined serious SSc -related complication.
Ananalysis of time to treatment failure excluding serious infections from the adjudicated 
serious SScrelated complications will also be conducted.
A sensitivity analysis of time to treatment failure will be pe rformed where discontinuation 
from study for the following reasons will also be classed as a treatment failure: death, 
lack of efficacy, lost to follow -up, withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130], physician decision (whereas 
withdrawal from study for the following reasons w ill not be counted as an event: AE, 
pregnancy, protocol violation, non-compliance, study terminated by [CONTACT_3211], other).
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
22/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767The proportion of patients with each of the components of time to treatment failure will 
be summarized descriptively. Serious SSc -related complications will be summarised by 
[CONTACT_9313] (SOC), and will be further subcategorised descriptively for 
assessment of internal organ involvement (including, but not limited to, cardiac disease, 
renal disease, and GI disease). All SSc -relate d complications (including adjudicated 
non-serious CTC grade 3 and 4 AEs) will be listed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Binary  Endpoints
For binary secondary endpoints, such as proportion of patients with 40% improvement 
in mRSS at W eek48 compared to baseline, the weighted difference in proportion will be 
presented, together with the 95% CI using the extended Mantel -Haenszel method and 
the p-value calculated using the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test, adjusting fo r the 
stratification factor, IL-6level (10; 10pg/mL) at screening (see Appendix 11for
statistical formulas) (Koch et al. 1989 ).  Patients who have a missing Week48 
assessment will be considered non -responders in the analysis.
For mRSS binary endpoints only there will be an additional analysis whereby [CONTACT_68173] -modulation therapy (e.g. ,DMARDs and/or Biologics) 
will be censored so that these patients will become non -responders in the analysis.
4.6.4 Exploratory  Efficacy  Endpoints
All exploratory endpoints will be summarized and where applicable e xploratory p-values
will be produced using the same methodology as specified for the secondary endpoints 
in Section 4.6.3 unless stated otherwise.
Combined Respon se Index for Sy stemic Sclerosis
The Combined Response Index for Systemic Sclerosis (CRISS) will be summarized as 
both a binary and continuous endpoint.  There will be no imputation of missing data.   
The calculation for the CRISS score is a two -step process and is as follows ( Khanna et 
al.2016 ):
Step 1 :if a patient develops any of the following they will be assigned a probability of 
improving equal to 0.0
new scleroderma renal crisis
decline in ppFVC 15% relative to baseline confirmed by a second FVC within one 
month, HRCT to confirm ILD (if previous HRCT did not show ILD) and FVC 80% of 
predicted attributable to systemic sclerosis
new onset of left ventricular failure (defined as left ventricular ejection fraction 45%) 
requiring treatment, attributable to systemic sclerosis
new onset of pulmonary arterial hypertension on right –sided heart catheterization 
requiring treatment, attrib utable to systemic sclerosis
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
23/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767Step 2: f or the remaining patients , compute the predicted probability of improving for

where ,MRSS indicates the change in MRSS from baseline to follow -up, FVCdenotes the 
change in ppFVC from baseline to follow -up, Pt-globindicates the change in patient 
global assessment, MD-globdenotes the change in physician global assessment, and 
HAQ -DIis the change in HAQ -DI.All changes are absolute change ( Time 2-Time baseline ).
Subjects for which the predicted probability isgreater or equal to 0.60 are considered 
improved, while subjects for which the predicted probability isbelow 0.60 are considered 
non-improved.   Continuous analysis will be performed using non -parametric methods.
Scleroderma Health A ssessment Questionnaire
The SHAQ is composed of the HAQ -DI scale (or J-HAQ scale for Japanese patients) 
with the addition of five scleroderma -specific VAS scales toassess additional elements
of SSc disease .  Each VAS item is rated separately ,with higher scores indicating more 
severe disease (range 0 100mm).   The five VAS scales are: 1)intestinal disease, 
2)breathing problems, 3)Raynaud syndrome, 4) digital ulcer s, and 5) overall disease .  
These VAS scales will all be analyzed independently.  A negative change from baseline 
indicates improvement .
Saint George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_68136] e’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_68137] 50 items distributed over three 
scales: respi[INVESTIGATOR_68138] (symptoms); impairment in patient activity as a 
result of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (activity); and impact of respi[INVESTIGATOR_68139] (impact).  Each scale is scored from 0 to 100, with t he total score 
representing the weighted average of these three subscores.
Each item in the SGRQ has specific weight (lowest possible weight 0, highest 100).  
Scores for the three scales and total are calculated using the assigned weights.  The 
numerator a nd denominator for the total and each scale are comprised of individual item 
weights, minus specific scale weights.  Additional details pertaining to missing data and 
scoring are described in Appendix 6.
FACIT Fatigue Scale
The FACIT fatigue scale is a 13 -item measure of fatigue, with patients scoring each item 
on a 5 -point scale.  A positive change from b aseline indicates improvement.  
FACIT -Fatigue total score will be calculated according to developer’s algorithm 
(Appendix 7)

24/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767SkinPRO Questionnaire
The Ski nPRO is a 22 -item, patient -completed questionnaire developed to measure skin 
health status as experienced by [CONTACT_68174].  There are 
4separate domains: skin symptoms, physical function, social function, and emotional 
respons e.Although the [ADDRESS_74311] recent validation work from the literature, which uses 18 items as described in
Appendix 8(Man A et al. 2017). There are 4 separate sub-scales: physical effects, 
physical limitations, emotional effects, and social effects. The response set for all items 
is a 7 -point ordinal scale, ranging from “Not at all” to “Very much”.  Total and subscale 
scores will be c alculated as described in Appendix 8. The questionnaire was only 
administered in patients in North America so results will be summarized for that 
subgroup only.
EuroQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire
The EQ-5D-3Lis a generic, preference -based health utility m easure with questions 
about mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression that 
are used to build a composite of the patient’s health status .  It is a concise scale that has 
performed well for patients with SSc ( Gualtierotti etal. 2016 ).  The EQ -5D-3L will be 
utilized in this study for economic modeling.   A positive change from baseline indicates 
improvement .  The EQ -5D will be scored according to the developer’s guidelines 
(EQ-5D-3L User Guide) using [LOCATION_006] utility values.  For further details o f EQ-5D see 
Appendix 9.
Work Productivity and A ctivity Impairment General Health
The W PAI-GH questionnaire is a six-item scale, asking patients to estimate the amount 
oftime that their work and daily activities were affected by [CONTACT_68175] 
7days .  The WPAI yields four types of scores:
1.Absenteeism (work time missed)
2.Presenteesism (impairment at work / reduced on -the-job effectiveness)
3.Work productivi ty loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism)
4.Activity Impairment
WPAI scores will be calculated according to developer’s algorithm described in
Appendix 10.
DLCO
Predicted DL COvalues are derived using height (ht) at screening (inches), age at 
screening, and patient sex.  The formula for predicted values for females and males are 
presented below ( Pesola et al. 2004 ):
Females: 2.2382 (0.111 age)(0.4068 ht)
Males: 12.9113 (0.229 age)(0.418 ht)
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
25/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767The predicted value is then adjusted for the hemoglobin level (g/dL) at each visit using 
the following formula to give predicted hemoglobin adjusted values
(MacIntyre etal.2005 ):
Females: DL,CO,predicted for Hb DL,CO,predicted (1.7 Hb/(9.38 Hb))
Males: DL,CO,predicted for Hb DL,CO,predicted (1.7 Hb/(10.22 Hb))

HRCT
Change from baseline to W eek48 in Quantitative Lung Fibrosis Score of the lobe of 
most involvement (QLF -LM)as determined by [CONTACT_68177].
The lobe of most involvement is determined as the lobe with the worst (highest) score at 
baseline out of the 5 lobes (left lower, left upper, right lower, right middle, right upper) for 
the specified parameter of interest (QLF in this case).
Other parameters collected from HRCT readings may also be summarized and change 
from baseline ofQLF-LM and other HRCT parameters may be summarised separately 
by [CONTACT_68178].
HRCT scans that were done prior to baseline may be permitted in place of a baseline 
scan in some cases.
4.6.5 Sensitivity Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity to Primary Estimand
If found to be statistically significant (p 0.05), the primary endpoint will be re -analyzed 
assuming that missing data is missing not at random (MNAR), rather than MAR, via 
tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] -point sensitivity analyses implemented using multiple imputation.
The PROC MI procedure in SAS using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method will be 
used to partially impute data and convert the dataset into a monotone missing data 
pattern.   One thousand monotone datasets will be imputed using the seed 1689, by 
[CONTACT_1570], including the stratification facto r as an indicator variable.
After imputing non-monotone data, the missing values remaining will be imputed using 
the PROC MI monotone regression procedure in SAS.   This regression based approach 
imputes missing data in a sequential manner with the use of u nivariate models; for each 
time point, a regression model based on all patients who have observations (imputed or 
observed) available at this time point is fitted and used to impute observations for 
patients with missing values at this time point. The var iables included in the imputation 
model will be treatment group, the stratification factor, IL -6 level ( 10; 10pg/mL) at 
screening, and the mRSS scores by [CONTACT_765]. The seed that will be used is 13820647. Only 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
26/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767one complete dataset will be imputed per mono tone dataset, resulting in one thousand 
complete datasets. 
Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]- point analysis will be implemented by [CONTACT_1583] (or subtracting) a constant delta to 
the MAR imputed values at the Week48 analysis time point in the direction of lack of 
efficacy for TCZ and in the direction of improvement for placebo. A range of evenly 
spaced deltas will be used to adjust imputed values in the TCZ and placebo arms 
independently in order to produce a grid of delta adjustments to missing values in both 
arms. The size of the deltas will be chosen pragmatically based on the primary analysis, 
so that adjustments that lead to non -significance are encompassed in the grid. In 
particular, assuming MAR on placebo, i.e. ,no delta adjustment, an adjustment on the 
TCZ arm that just tip s the analysis into non- significance will be included.
For each pair of delta adjustments (TCZ and placebo) each dataset will be analyzed 
separately using the same analysis model specified for the primary endpoint and the 
results combined using the PROC MIANALYZE procedure in SAS. The resulting point 
estimates of treatment effect, 95% CIs and corresponding p -values under each pair of 
deltas will be tabulated.
As an additional sensitivity analysis to the primary estimand a pattern -mixture model will 
be im plemented, using multiple imputations, whereby [CONTACT_68179] a missing -at-random assumption and missing data in the TCZ arm 
will be imputed in a stepwise fashion using multiple calls to PROC MI with a monotone 
regression statement using data from placebo- treated patients as the basis for the 
imputation ( Ratitch and O'Kelly 2011).  This imputation method assumes that patients 
who are lost to follow -up in the TCZ arm, that stop study drug and may revert to 
standard of care, will have a trajectory similar to that of patients in the placebo arm.  This 
is a reasonable assumption as there is a lack of proven effective treatment for patients to 
transition to. It also assumes that these patients will not have an immediate worsening 
of outcome upon study drug discontinuation.  Conservatively, missing data on the 
placebo arm is assumed missing at random, since withdrawals on placebo in the Phase 
II Fasscinate Study on average had worse outcomes at the point of withdrawal than 
patients that continued in the study .
Firstly, the data will be imputed to be monotone exactly as described for the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_30350]. Successive calls to PROC MI will then be made, using seed [ADDRESS_74312] observations available at this 
time point will be fitted and used to impute observations for TCZ pat ients with missing 
values at this time point. The imputation model will include the stratification factor, IL -6 
level ( 10;10pg/mL) at screening, in addition to the baseline mRSS score, and first 
post baseline mRSS score. In step two, TCZ patients wit h the second post -baseline 
time point missing will be selected out and pooled with the placebo group. As well as 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
27/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767the stratification factor, the model will include the second post -baseline visit mRSS 
scores, as well as prior observed or imputed mRSS scores from the previous step. Data 
across all the visits will be imputed in this way, to result in a thousand imputed datasets 
(there will only be one imputation per monotone dataset). Each dataset will be analyzed 
separately using the same analysis model specified for the primary endpoint and the 
results combined using the PROC MIANALYZE procedure in SAS. The resulting point 
estimate of treatment effect, 95% CI and corresponding p -value will be presented
(Ratitch andO'Kelly 2011 ).
A linear regression analysis (with Huber White sandwich errors) of change from 
baseline in mRSS at week 48 will be performed. The model w ill include the stratification 
factor, baseline mRSS score ,and treatment group.
[IP_ADDRESS] Alternative Estimand
A second estimand for the difference in change from baseline in mRSS will also be 
determined. Data post initiation of immuno -modulation therapy (e.g. ,DMARDs and/or 
Biologics) and /ordata collected after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_68140] (MMRM) model described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will be 
implemented.  The estim andof interest for this analysis is the difference be tween 
treatment arms in the mean change in the mRSS at Week48 for the ITT population if the 
randomi zed treatments were taken as directed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity to Secondary  Endpoints
Similarly, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_68141] , using the same seeds and 
number of imputations will be performed for all the continuous variables in the multiplicity 
testing procedure shown in Section 4.6.1 with the exception of the time to treatment 
failure endpoint. For each endpoint the analysis method of the imputed d atasets will be 
the same method as specified for the multiplicity testing procedure.
For the binary endpoints of the difference in proportions of patients with 20%, 40%, 
and60% improvement in mRSS at Week48 compared with baseline, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_68142]. Patients with missing change from baseline in mRSS at 
Week48 are non -responders for the primary analysis method. These patients will be 
incrementally set to responders independently for each treatment arm. The number of 
patients with missing data set to responders per treatment arm will be presented in a 
grid, and the resulting difference in proportions, 95% CI and p -value will be tabulated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Immun o-Modulating Treatments

performed as appropriate.
4.7 PHA RMA COKINETIC A NALYSES
For the Week48 analysis, TCZ serum concentrations (C trough) will be summarized by [CONTACT_16787], means, medians, standard deviations, minimum, maximum, 
and coefficients of variation (standard deviation/mean)*100).  Plots of mean and 
standard deviation of TCZ (C trough) by [CONTACT_765] w ill also be presented.  Tocilizumab 
concentration at Week48 will be summarized based on tertiles of the values.  Effect of 
ADA positivity on serum TCZ concentrations will be assessed by [CONTACT_68184] -time profiles of ADA positive patients (definition in 
Section 4.10.6) with the individual profiles of the remainder of the population.  Nonlinear 
mixed -effect modelling (NONMEM) will be used to estimate population and individual 
PKparameters and the influence of various covariates on these parameters will be 
investigated. Major baseline covariates will be identified and the dependence of 
PKparameters on each covariate will be described. Secondary PK parameters, such as 
AUC, C max, and C troughat steady state, will be listed and summa rized.  Results of the 
popPK analysis will be reported separately from the CSR.
4.[ADDRESS_74313] A NALYSES
In order to characterize exposure -efficacy relationships, continuous responses (e.g., 
mRSS and all positively trending secondary efficacy endpoints as noted in Section 2.2) 
will be summarized based on exposure tertiles (high, medium, and low exposures) in the 
active treatment group and compared to placebo patients.  In addition, for binary 
secondary endpoints (e.g., patients who show a 20% improvement i n mRSS at 
Week48) a comparison of observed TCZ C troughat Week48 grouped in tertiles, in 
responders will be compared to non-responders .
In order to characterize exposure- safety relationships, summary tables of AEs by [CONTACT_68185] C troughat Week48 will be produced.  The proportion of patients by 
[CONTACT_68186] (NCI 
CTCAE) grade (categorization based on worst post -baseline value) ( NCI 2003 )will be

4.[ADDRESS_74314] frequently; no statistical analyses comparing safety data between two groups wil l 
be conducted.  All safety data in the W eek 48 safety data cut will be included for the 
primary analysis.  
Since data entry for the study is ongoing, safety data that are not associated with a 
specific visit may be updated after the analysis time point f or an individual patient.  For 
example, an adverse event ( AE)that starts on or prior to the W eek48 visit for a specific 
patient will be included in the W eek48 analysis.  It is possible that the AE may be 
updated beyond W eek48 for the patient (e.g., an AE that was ongoing could be given 
an end date).  Such updates would be reported in the W eek96 final CSR.
4.10.1 Adverse Events
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used as the thesaurus for 
AEs and disease codes, and the GNE drug dictio nary will be used for treatments.  A 
glossary of these codes will be produced.  Because all outputs produced for the 
Week48 and Week96,reporting will be produced using the latest versions of MedDRA 
and the GNE drug dictionary ;there may be discrepancies between the different reporting 
events for the same AE/medication.
Only treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized.  Treatment -emergent events are 
defined as those AEs with observed or imputed onset date on or after the start dat e of 
trial treatment.  Only where the most extreme intensity is greater than the initial intensity 
(or if most extreme intensity is not missing and initial intensity is missing) will events with 
an onset date prior to the start of trial treatment be consid ered treatment -emergent.  An 
AE with a completely missing start date will be assumed to be treatment -emergent 
unless the AE has a complete non-imputed end date that is prior to study day 1.
Adverse events will be coded and tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] ( SOC) and/or 
preferred term.  In tabulations, preferred terms and their associated SOC will be 
presented in order of descending frequency summed across the treatment arms.  
Adverse events will also be tabulated by [CONTACT_68190].  Adverse events leading to withdrawal, AEs leading to 
death, and AEs leading to a dose modification or interruption will be summarized.
Adverse event rates per 100 patient years exposure (defined as the number of 
events /total duration in the study multiplied by 100) will be calculated for each AE 
preferred term and SOC, along with the corresponding 95% CIs for the rates of the SOC 
(exact based on the χ2distribution [ Ulm et al. 1990 ]).

4.10.6 Immunogenicity
Samples for the detection of anti-TCZ antibodies (ADA, anti-drug antibodies, here refers 
to anti-TCZ antibodies) and analysis of immunogenicity will be taken at baseline and at 
Weeks1, 8, 16, 24, 36, and 48 (or study withdrawal/completion).  For patients 
experiencing anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity reactions that result in withdrawal from the 
study, a sample for detection of ADA will be taken at the time of the event and also at 
least [ADDRESS_74317] dose of TCZ/placebo.
Blood samples will be analyz ed for the evaluation of immunogenicity of TCZ by a 
number of different assays.  Samples that are positive for ADA in the screening assay 
will be further analyzed by a confirmation assay to confirm specificity.  If the confirmation 
assay is positive, two additional tests will be performed:  a neutralizing assay for the 
ability to inhibit the activity of TCZ and a test for ADA of the IgE isotype.
The immunogenicity analyses will include patients with at least one sample analyzed 
using immunogenicity assay.  The numbers and proportions of ADA positive patients 
after TCZ exposure during the study (including both the treatment and follow -up periods) 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
34/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Patients are considered to be ADA positive if 
they are ADA negative at bas eline but develop an ADA response following study drug 
administration (treatment -induced ADA response).

1U/mL), and anti -centromere (positive 1:40dilution ).  Shift tables of the number of 
patients positive for each antibody at screening and W eek48 will be summarized for the 
safety population.
4.[ADDRESS_74318] 76 patients reached the Week24 visit or withdrew and was 
based on the change from baseline in mRSS at W eek24. The futility analysis was 
conducted by [CONTACT_68199], iDCC (independent Data Co-ordinating 
Centre) and was reviewed by [CONTACT_68200]. Details of the futility analysis, along with the 
rationale and timing are documented in the study iDMC charter. The beta spending 
funct ion used and all other details of the futility analysis were exactly as specified in the 
charter; however the maximum information of the planned design was altered in the 
SEQ DESIGN procedure in SAS from the assumed 1.[ADDRESS_74319] deviation. The boundary and operating 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
35/Statistical Analysis Plan WA29767characteristics of the interim were based on the information fraction at the interim being 
approximately 0.5.
The original design of this interim was based on the Phase II study data assuming a 
common standard deviation of 6.[ADDRESS_74320] deviation of the 
pooled blinded week 24 data at the time of the interim snapshot was 5.43, much smaller 
than that originally assumed when designing the interim; th us the variability was lower in 
the Phase III study than had been expected. Assuming a standard deviation in both 
treatment arms of 5.[ADDRESS_74321] 
error assumed for the final analysis at Week24 was re -evaluated by [CONTACT_1034]; giving 
an expected maximum information of 1.66. This adjustment was made in order that the 
interim fraction would be approximately 0.5, in accordance with the planned boundary. 
The interim was conducted in December 2016, with a “continue” decision made by [CONTACT_68201] 16 December 2016. The Sponsor remained blinded throughout, with only a 
continue decision communicated. All documentation, including the closed meeting 
minutes and recommendations from the iDMC, will be made available after study 
unblinding.

Investigational Medicinal Products
Test Product (Investigational Drug)
Patients assigned to the TCZ group will receive a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of 
162mg of TCZ once weekly (QW ) for [ADDRESS_74331] for the primary  analysis is the difference between treatment arms in the 
mean change in the mRSS at Week 48 for the intent to treat (ITT) population.  The study has 
been designed to continue to capture efficacy  data on patients who discontinue s tudy drug 
prematurely or receive escape therapi[INVESTIGATOR_68148] -blind treatment period.  These data 
will be included in the primary analysis.  
Determination of Sample Size  
A sample size of approximately 105 patients in the TCZ group and 105 patients in the placebo 
group (a total of 210 patients) will give power in the range of 75% to 80%, (allowing for an 
estimated patient dropout rate of approximately 15% to 20%) to detect a between -group 
difference of 3.55 units (common standard deviation of 8.43 ) in mean change in mRSS from 
baseline to W eek [ADDRESS_74332], with a 5% two-sided significance level.  The 
minimal detectable difference in mRSS (smallest treatment difference that would give a 
statistically significant result) under these as sumptions, and with a patient dropout rate of 20%, 
is approximately 2.6 units.

Interim A nalyses
The Sponsor will define a futility analysis to which the Sponsor will remain blinded.  The futility 
analysis will be cond ucted by [CONTACT_68218].  The 
futility analysis will be based on the treatment difference for change from baseline in mRSS at 
Week 24; the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_68149] a beta spending function.  The study will 
be stopped for futility if the endpoint meets the futility criterion.
The futility analysis will be conducted when approximately [ADDRESS_74333] withdrawn.  Since a repeated measures analy sis will be used for the 
futility criterion, partial data from additional patients enrolled at (but not yet completed) Week [ADDRESS_74334] reached W eek 24, the timing of the futil ity analy sis approximates half of the final 
expected information (I) at W eek 24, where I is the inverse of the expected variance of the 
treatment difference when all patients have reached W eek 24.
Full statistical details of the futilit y analysis, along with the rationale, and timing will be 
documented in the iDMC charter.  The iDMC charter will be made available to the relevant 
health authorities

HAQ-DI 
The HAQ-DI is a self-completed patient question naire specific for RA.  It consists of 
20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, 
hygiene, reach, grip, and common daily activities.  There are four possible responses for each component: 
0without any difficulty 
1with some difficulty 
2with much difficulty 
3unable to do 
 
A domain score is determined from the highest score of the components in that domain 
(except when aids and devices are taken into account; see below).  For example, if there are three components in a domain and the responses were 1, [ADDRESS_74349] a score. 
The HAQ-DI takes into account the patient’s use of aids or devices in the scoring for a 
domain.  For each of the eight domains, there is an aids or devices companion variable(s) that is used to record any assistance the patient uses.  Where aids or devices are indicated by a patient for a domain or help from another person is required for a domain, if the maximum score for the domain is 2, the domain score is increased to [ADDRESS_74350] the use of an aid or device, or help.  If the maximum value is 2, the score is 
not modified.  In the event that a domain score is missing but a corresponding aid or device is listed, then the score for that domain will reflect the use of the aid or device (i.e., it will be scored as 2). 
Where “other” is ticked for use of aids or devices, the use of the aid or device will not be 
assigned to a domain and will therefore not be reflected in the domain scoring. 
HAQ-DI scores can range from 0 to 3.

St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_68150] A LGORITHM
Three component scores are calculated: Symptoms; Activity; Impacts. One Total score 
is also calculated.
PRINCIPLE OF CA LCULA TION
Each questionnaire response has a unique empi[INVESTIGATOR_68151] 'weight'. The lowest 
possible weight is zero and the highest is 100. Each component of the questionnaire is 
scored separately in three steps: 
1.The weights for all items with a positive response are summed. 
2.The weights for missed items are deducted from the maximu m possible weight for 
each component. The weights for all missed items are deducted from the maximum 
possible weight for the Total score. 
3.The score is calculated by [CONTACT_68225] a percentage: 
Total and scale scores will be calculated as follows:
Total Score 100*((Σ item weights)/(maximum total weight))
Symptom Score 100*((Σ item 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 weights )/(maximum symptom total 
weight))
Activity Sc ore100*((Σ item 11, 15 weights)/(maximum activity total weight))
Impact Score 100*((Σ item 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 weights)/(maximum impact total 
weight)
Sum of maximum pos sible weights for each component and Total: 
Symptoms: 662.5 
Activity: 1209.1 
Impacts: 2117.8 
Total: 3989.4 
(Note: these are the maximum possible weights that could be obtained for the worst 
possible state of the patient). 
It will be noted that the questionnaire requests a single response to questions 1 -7, 9-10 
and 17. If multi ple responses are given to one of these questions then the weights for all 
positive responses for that question will be averaged.

For information regarding question weights, please refer to the St George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_68152], Version 2.3. 
Missing individual items for the scoring of the SGRQ will be handled as follows: The 
symptoms component will be considered missing if more than 2 of the items are missing.  The activity component will be considered missing if more than 4 of the items are missing.  The impacts component will be considered missing if more than 6 of the items are missing.  The total score will be considered missing if any component is missing.  For a valid component questionnaire with unanswered questions, the predefined weight and score for a particular missing question will be used to calculate the aggregated score for the component (St George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_68153], Version 2.3).  Missing data will not be imputed.

FACIT-FATIGUE 
The FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire consists of 13 statements designed to measure the 
degree of fatigue experienced by [CONTACT_68226] 7 days.  For each question there are five possible responses: 0 (not at all), 1 (a little bit), 2 (somewhat), 3 (quite a bit), 4 (very much).  Statements 1 to 6 and 9 to 13 are worded so that higher scores correspond to greater fatigue, while statements 7 and 8 are worded so that higher scores correspond to less fatigue.  All scores except those for statements 7 and 8 will therefore be “reversed” on the 0 to 4 scale (i.e., a response of 0 will receive a score of 4, a response of 1 will receive a score of 3, etc.), so that for all questions higher scores will reflect improvement. 
For each questionnaire, if there are less than 7 responses recorded, then the total 
fatigue score will be considered missing.  If there are 7 or more responses recorded, then the total fatigue score for that questionnaire will be calculated as the average of the non-missing scores multiplied by 13.  FACIT-Fatigue scores range from 0 to 52.

SkinPRO 
The SkinPRO is a patient-reported outcome instrument developed to assess the skin-
related quality of life in patients with Ssc.  Initially, the SkinPRO contained 22 items, but 
following further validation work, 4 items from the SkinPRO were dropped (2, 4, 6, 22) 
resulting in an 18 item final version referred to as the SSPRO ( Man A et al. 2017).  The 
SSPRO has 4 subscales: physical effects, physical limitations, emotional effects, and social effects.  Each item is scored on a 7-point Likert scale (0 6) with verbal anchors at 
0 (Not at all) and 6 (very much). For the version of the SSPRO in protocol WA29767, items 1, 3, 5, 7 21 contribute to the 
total score.  This has a range of 0 to 108, which is then transformed to a 0 100 scale 
(the score is divided by 108 and then multiplied by 100).  Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms/impacts.  For the subscales, the items included are as follows: physical effects (Items 1, 3, 5, 7, 8), physical limitations (Items 9-14), emotional effects (items 15 18), and social effects (items 19 21).  The subscale scores are also 
transformed to a 0-100 scale for ease of comparison.

EQ-5D -3L
The EQ VAS records the respondents self-rated health status on a vertical graduated 
(0-100) visual analogue scale.  Part icipants draw a line from a box to the point on the 
thermometer -like scale corresponding to their health state ( 100Best health state).  
Scores for the visual analogue scale reflect the position where participant's line crosses 
the thermometer -like scale.
The EQ -5D-3L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of health :
1.mobility
2.self-care
3.usual activities
4.pain/discomfort
5.anxiety/depression
Each dimension comprises three levels (no problems, some problems, and extreme 
problems).  Participants are asked to indicate their level of health by [CONTACT_68227].

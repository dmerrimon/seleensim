Title:  Heart Health Buddies: Peer Support to Decrease CVD Risk  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_267785], MD MSPH  
Co-Investigators: Eugene Od done, MD  MHS ; Maren Olsen, PhD  
 
Purpose . This intervention will use a hybrid reciprocal peer support and peer coach 
model to initiate and sustain healthy behavioral changes. Veterans who are at -risk for 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) will be enrolled in the study and paired with another 
Veteran to receive and provide social support a round engaging in CVD risk reduction 
behaviors. Enrolled participants will be offered a series of group sessions focused on 
CVD risk reduction goal setting and action plan development. Between group sessions, 
peer partners will be asked to have weekly call s to discuss action plan challenges, 
explore options for problem solving, and provide encouragement and accountability for 
personal goals. Participants who do not engage in the group sessions or weekly phone 
calls, or who request additional help, will rece ive support from trained peer coaches. 
The goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_267786] ( RPS) and peer coach  intervention to improve heart healthy behaviors among 
Veterans at risk for CVD. The aims are:  
 
Aim 1: Examine the feasibility and acceptability of a 12 -week hybrid peer coach -
reciprocal peer support intervention for Veterans at risk for CVD  
• Feasibility will be evaluated by [CONTACT_267797], measurement of enrollment 
and retention rates  
• Acceptabili ty will be assessed quantitatively by [CONTACT_267798] -report of amount, frequency and modality of 
contacts, rates of participation in group sessions, and through post -intervention 
qualitative interviews with s tudy participants and study staff  
 
Aim 2: Explore gender differences in feasibility/acceptability of new hybrid peer support 
model  
• Gender differences will be evaluated through qualitative comparison of 
participant reported experiences with intervention con tent as well as peer and 
group interactions by [CONTACT_547]; and, quantitatively via exploration of differences in 
enrollment, retention, refusal reasons and frequency of peer contacts  
 
Background and Significance . The majority of middle -aged Veterans have at le ast 
one risk factor for cardiovascular disease1; these risk factors and subsequent 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) lead to significant personal and financial burden for 
patients and the VA healthcare system2. Poor social support incurs additional risk of 
cardiac and all -cause mortality 3, while higher levels of social support lead to better 
health outcomes4. Unfortunately, many Veterans are socially isolated, and 61.8% of 
female  and 47.6% of male  middle -aged Veterans are unmarried 5. While supplemental 
social support can come from multiple sources, one type that may be especially well -
suited to the Veteran population is peer support. Peer support is an evidence -based 
 Buddies – Goldstein  
8/10/[ADDRESS_326130] been effective in promoting health 
outcomes 6,7. The strength and benefit of these different models of peer support varies 
based on patients’ motivation levels and their ability to proactively engage with peers.  
Design. We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_267787] a 12 -week intervention to evaluate 
proof of concept of a hybrid peer coach/reciprocal peer support intervention for 
Veterans (Figure  1). Using the ORBIT (Obesity Related Behavioral Intervention Trials) 
framework for intervention development8, this phase II study will aim to assess 
acceptability and feasibility with specific attention to gender -differences and an 
assessment of factors contributing to successful peer engagement. Veterans who are 
at-risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_267788] a novel peer -support 
intervention that combines reciprocal peer support with additional peer coaching for less 
motivated participants and provides all participants with interactive, facilitated group 
sessions. The study will include up to 24 patients (or up to 12 peer -partner pairs) and up 
to 6 peer coaches per cohort. We will consider conducting a second cohort for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_267789].  This study was presented to the Durham 
COIN’s Veteran Research Engagemen t Panel (VetREP), a group of 11 Veterans who 
are dedicated to providing feedback, and input from this panel was incorporated into the 
design, including content for group sessions, peer partner matching criteria, approach to 
recruitment messaging, and inter vention name.

[CONTACT_267804] a recruitment letter from study staff at the Durham VAMC. 
Participants will have a least a week after recruitment letters are mailed to call in and 
opt-out of study participation.  Potential participants will also be recruited  via provider 
referrals or by [CONTACT_267805]. Study staff  will call 
patients to further ascertain eligibility, describe the study and schedule an in -person 
baseline assessment.  
 
Baseline visit:  Veterans meeting eligibili ty criteria and who express interest in 
participating in the study  will be scheduled for an in -person visit with a study staff 
member. Participants will sign a written consent and HIPAA. After completing the 
consent process, participants will complete self-report measures  (see Table 1 below).  
This visit will be scheduled at a time acceptable to the Veteran and participants will be  
compensated $50  for this visit . 
 
Table 1. Outcome  measurements  
 
Baseline visit  content : The Veteran will 
complete survey s and baseline 
measurements including height, weight, 
blood pressure, arm curls, six minute 
walk, fasting blood draw, and an 
assessment to obtain information for peer 
matching (not peer coaches). Patient will 
also receive an activity monitor  at the 
baseline  visit. Participants will be 
compensated  up to $120; $ 50 for 
completion of the baseline visit , $[ADDRESS_326139] -asses sment , incentive 
of $20 for completing 10 -12 weekly 
phone calls with their peer support , or $ 10 for completing 4 -9 weekly phone calls with 
peer support . This will be measured by [CONTACT_6270] -report  through paper logs that participants 
will submit and /or through SMS/text messaging updates . The participants will be 
instructed not to include identifying info rmation in texts.   
 
Reciprocal peer pair matching : Prior peer support research supports the importance of 
giving and receiving peer support from someone of similar background and life 
experience (i.e., health condition). Peer pairs will be matched on prim ary behavior goal 
(either physical activity or diet) and gender. If possible given the small size of this study, 
peer pairs will also be matched on additional characteristics such as military era. 
However, we suspect that matching on this many variables wi ll prove difficult due to the

directly.  
 
Peer coaches : Before interaction with reciprocal peer pairs, coaches will undergo 
approximately 3-[ADDRESS_326141] on their experience improving their own 
CVD risk factor control and consider how they can work with other Veterans to achieve 
similar success 11. Peer coach training will be reinforced at monthly peer coach “check -
in” meetings for debriefing and problem solving12. Coaches can also contact [CONTACT_267806]. Coaches will  receive  up to $370 in  
incentive payments for participation in study activities: $50 for  completing the baseline , 
$75 for the initial training, up to $75  for attending and leading activities at the 3 group 
sessions  ($25 per group) , $50 for the 12 -week follow -up and $10 per month per 
participant coached by [CONTACT_81006] a m aximum of $40 per month  (120 total) . Coach to 
participants calls will be verified by [CONTACT_6270] -report through submitted paper call logs and /or 
SMS/text reporting.  They will be paid at [ADDRESS_326142] :  Participants who complete the baseline assessment will b e 
scheduled to attend the first group session (see Table 3). During this session, 
participants will be introduced to both their peer partner and peer coaches. This initial 
session will include an overview of key CVD facts, action planning, a brief (<1 hour ) 
training session on being an effective peer partner (e.g. instruction on key MI 
communication skills), and relationship building activities for peer partners. Participants 
will set an initial action plan step towards their behavioral goal. At the end of this 
session, peer pairs will agree upon a time for their next contact [CONTACT_267807]. Depending on the timing of recruitment and the first group session, peer 
coaches may reach out to individual reciprocal peer participants by [CONTACT_648] w hile 
awaiting the first group session to keep them engaged.  
 
Structured group sessions:  As noted through prior work, peer support interventions are 
most successful when paired with a structured behavior change or self -management 
 Buddies – Goldstein  
8/10/[ADDRESS_326143]  at 
approximately week 1, week 3 and week 5. Each session will include brief instructi on 
and practice of an accessible physical activity (i.e. stretching, yoga), a small amount of 
didactic content, and 
time for peer partners 
to problem solve 
action plans and 
provide in -person 
encouragement and 
support.  Physical 
activity exercises and 
didac tic content will be 
led by a study 
interventionist; peer 
activities will be led by 
[CONTACT_102224]. Participants 
will be asked to 
complete brief 
assessments of the 
quantity and quality of 
their interactions with 
peer partners since the previous group session. Cont ent for listed domains will be 
adapted from existing and previously developed resources (e.g. MOVE!’s Telephone 
lifestyle coaching workbook). Participants will be provided with personalized 
participation certificates  at group 3.  
 
Reciprocal Peer Pair conta cts: Peer partners will be encouraged to have at least one 
contact [CONTACT_267808] 12 weeks; this frequency of calls is supported by [CONTACT_267809] 7,15. 
Peer partners may have more frequent contact [CONTACT_267810]. Based on prior studies, 
we anticipate that the average length of each call will be approximately 10-[ADDRESS_326144] with problem solving if communication  concerns are raised. Peer 
buddies will be asked to send an SMS/text message to the study team phone after each 
call with their partner to assist with verification that a call has taken place. If no message 
has been received for a buddy pair  for one week , then a SMS/text message will be sent 
to the pair reminding them to attempt a call.  If no message has been received from  a 
buddy pair  for two weeks, then a peer coach will call them individually  to check -in and 
assist with any problem solving as needed .

 Partners will be provided with sample questions and prompts to initiate and guide 
discussion on action plans and problem solving . However, they will not be scripted as to 
promote authentic communication and enhance the perceived value of peer 
communication ; thus, tangential topi[INVESTIGATOR_267791]. All 
participants will be instructed not to give medical advice and that they should not act on 
any advice given to stop or start a new therapy without discussing with their provider. 
Participant s will have contact [CONTACT_267811] a participant would like 
to request a new partner and the  24-hour VA crisis line number if he or she is  having 
urgent concerns about a partner’s well -being. It is expected that incompatibility of peer 
dyads requiring cessation of peer contact [CONTACT_267812] 6,16. If a peer pair is recognized as incompatible, those peers will be 
accommodated on a case -by-case basis including potentially having them join another 
peer partner team or being supported directly by a peer coach.  
 
Peer coach contacts:  Peer coache s will have up to three  types of interactions with the 
reciprocal peer pairs: 1) leading activities and discussions at group sessions, 2) a 
beginning and  mid-study  phone call to individual peer partners to check -in on peer 
partner experiences and provide guidance and interaction support, and 3) ongoing 
phone support as needed. As needed coach phone support will be triggered by: 1) lack 
of participant engagement in ca lls to partner or attending group sessions  (for example, if 
there are no phone calls between a pair of reciprocal peer support partners in first 10 -14 
days) , or 2) if requested. Coaches will have sample scripts to reference during  phone 
support calls and a  manualized guide for group session activities. All group sessions will 
be monitored for fidelity by [CONTACT_978] [CONTACT_2329] a checklist for key features of the planned 
session. Coaches will then receive supportive feedback on their approach and pointers 
on needed ad justments. They will also have opportunity to role play during  at least 
group monthly sessions with all peer coaches to practice and hone their communication 
and non -directive support skills. The amount of time each coach will spend providing 
support will be [ADDRESS_326145] monitoring : We will ask participants to send an SMS/text message to the 
study coordinators study phone after each call with their peer buddy (and for coaches 
after calls with a peer buddy participant). If we have not heard from a buddy pair after 
one week, w e will send SMS reminder . All text messages will be sent from a study 
specific phone number used only  for texting and calling participants.   Receiving 
SMS/text message verification of buddy pair communication and coach to buddy 
communication will help us to identify an efficient, validated method of communication 
verification for future use  in future stud ies. Other monitoring approaches may include: a) 
self-report of the number and approximate length of recent calls during each group 
session; b) a brief, post -intervention survey that will include specific questions about 
frequency and duration of peer comm unication; c) informal participant feedback about 
peer contact [CONTACT_41705], improvements needed to peer orientation and need for specific

reported.  
 
Outcome Measures:  Outcome measures will be assessed during a post -intervention 
visit at [ADDRESS_326147] -intervention evaluation at week 12 will receive a $50 incentive.  Heart 
health buddies are paid $50 after the baseline and after the 12 -week follow -up visit.  
 
Feasibility  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_267813] (i. e., #patients sent letters,  #consented , #consented in response to flyers, 
#consented by [CONTACT_267814]), retention rates (#participants completing week [ADDRESS_326148]-intervention assessment , # completing baseline assessment), drop -out rates, and 
reasons for r efusal. We will also track frequency and amount of completed peer partner 
and peer coach calls using self -report  via SMS/text message and on paper logs  as well 
as attendance at group sessions.  
 
Acceptabilit y will be assessed through post-intervention interviews . The conversation 
will be recorded via a VA -approved device (USB Sparky recorder).  Peer partners will be 
called on the phone. Coach feedback will be collected at either the final coach check -in 
group, or over the phone .  The re cording will be kept on a VA computer behind a VA 
firewall.  For all participants, we will ask about perceived value of group sessions, 
training experience, facilitators and barriers to peer interactions, and general feedback 
about improving the interventio n. Reciprocal peer participants will also be questioned 
about their perceptions of the peer matching process and receipt of support from peer 
coaches. Peer coaches will be asked about the value of the monthly coach meetings 
and their experience supporting reciprocal peer pairs and individual participants. 
Experience with peer interaction  will be assessed using an established [ADDRESS_326149] , and 
recording steps and active minutes from a n activity monitor at group sessi ons and the 
12 week study visit .  Diet will be assessed using Starting the Conversation21 which is an 
8-item measure designed for health behavior promotion with summary scores ranging 
from 0 (more healthy diet) to 16 (less healthy diet). Physical para meters  such as weight, 
height, serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_267792]. Venipuncture will take 
place at a Durham VAMC clinical lab to obtain lab values , with blood samples staying 
within the Durham VAMC environment. Specimens will  not be reta ined.  
Analyses:  Aim 1: Examine the feasibility and acceptability of a 12 -week hybrid peer 
coach/reciprocal PS intervention for Veterans at risk for CVD:   
 Buddies – Goldstein

 Quantitative measures  We will calculate the outcome retention rate. For self -report we 
will calculate mean and distribution of the number and duration of peer phone contacts 
(both reciprocal peer pairs and peer coach calls) and compare to planned call 
frequency. We will also ask participants about any behavior changes made during the 
intervention  and compare change from baseline in a diet and exercise assessment. We 
will also examine changes from baseline in patient -centered measures (e.g. physical 
parameters, social support) to assess variability of outcome measures to ensure 
appropriate responsi veness needed for use in an IIR. We will not interpret p values or 
determine an effect size as this is not appropriate for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]22.  
Qualitative measures : Post -intervention interviews will be audio -recorded  and 
analyzed using a rapid analysis approach  based on key features of peer support 23 (e.g. 
support of daily management) and data-derived  codes. Participant responses will be 
organized by [CONTACT_094] -planned constructs (e.g., barriers and facili tators to peer partner 
interactions) and suggestions for improving the intervention . The qualitative interview 
will take place by [CONTACT_267815] a VA phone  or in-person focus group for 
the coaches,  and recorded on a VA -approved recording devi ce (Sparky USB recorder). 
The recordings will be kept on a VA computer behind the VA firewall. Team members 
will listen to the recorded interviews and take detail ed notes according to the  pre-
planned constructs.  This process will be completed for approximately five interview 
recordings. After the initial review and coding, the preliminary findings will be discussed 
as a team. Additional review by [CONTACT_267816].  Once 
any differences have been resolved, t hen the rest will be coded independently by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Goldstein. Interview results will inform further intervention tailoring. For example, we 
may learn that peers would prefer more frequent opportunity to meet with their partner 
early in th e intervention or that peers want additional access to peer coaches.  
Aim 2: Assess gender differences in feasibility and acceptability of 12 -week hybrid peer 
coach/reciprocal peer support intervention:  We plan to target 50% recruitment of women 
Veterans t o allow for stratification of feasibility and acceptability assessments by 
[CONTACT_547]. We will seek evidence of large differences in recruitment, retention, or rates of 
peer call completion that might suggest lower engagement in intervention activities. 
Additi onally, we will stratify interview analysis by [CONTACT_267817]. Such differences, if identified, would inform the need for 
gender -specific tailoring of the intervention activities. For example, if female parti cipants 
attend group sessions at notably lower rates than male participants and qualitative 
interviews identify that women do not feel comfortable participating in peer activities with 
men, then we will consider a gender -specific peer intervention for CVD risk reduction in 
the future.  
 
Sample size : As noted, we plan to recruit sufficient participants to support two cohorts 
of reciprocal peer pairs and group sessions, with a target enrollment of up to [ADDRESS_326150] while 
being responsive with the practical limitations of t he shortened time period for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].   
A larger sample is not needed as we are trying to be powered to perform inferential 
statistics.

Data Management : Data collection will occur using VA -approved software, which are  
REDCap, Epi [CONTACT_5628],and/or Excel , and Atlas Ti . Recording of the post -intervention 
interview will be over the phone and recorded on a Sparky device.  A study tracking 
database will be created for this study in conjunction with the Center’s software 
development team using Microsoft.NET  and/or excel spreadsheets . Outcome measures 
will be entered into database using REDcap,  which is a VA  Intranet Web application  
approved by [CONTACT_267818] . The REDcap software is web -based but 
participants will be interviewed either i n person or over the phone and data will be 
entered  by [CONTACT_267819]’s firewall.  The data are housed 
on a VA Informatics & Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) Server . All study data will be 
stored on a secure VA server.  The tracking and survey databases for this study will be 
developed in conjunction the Durham COIN biostatistics unit (di rected by  [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Olsen, 
mentor) and the software development core.  Call attempts , call lengths and number of 
texts will be collected by [CONTACT_6270] -report . Study participants will be encouraged to wear a 
pedometer/ activity meter for the duration of the study . We will provide a non blue -tooth 
enabled pedometer/activity meter type device to the participants.  We will ask them to 
bring their pedometer to each group meeting , and the final assessment , so that steps  or 
daily activity data from the past 21-30 days can be manually collected  from the device 
by a staff member during the group meeting /asse ssment .    
 
Safety Monitoring Plan . This is a minimal risk study so the potential for serious 
adverse events related to the study is low. We will document reported adverse events or 
problems on a standardized case report form detailing the event, when it o ccurred, any 
pertinent diagnostic workup, any treatment, and whether and when the symptom or 
problem resolved. Study staff will report any adverse event or unanticipated problem to 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97318]. We will review any such events and determine the likelihood they 
were due to the study. Statistical tests are not planned for analyzing the safety data 
during the con duct of the study. There are no conditions that trigger an immediate 
suspension of the research. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_267793], unexpected, and study -
related adverse event or unanticipated problem to the local IRB according to the 
institution’s requiremen ts. The IRB will review all adverse events during continuing 
review, which will likely occur annually. All adverse events will be reported in the annual 
report to the VAMC IRB.   
There are few potential risks associated with any of the measures or data to be 
collected. Participants do not have to answer any question that they do not wish to 
answer, as will be explained during the consent process. There are also small risks of 
injury or heart problems due to increased participation in physical activity. The threat of 
this potential problem will be reduced by [CONTACT_267820], as well as contraindications for continui ng physical activity. 
Because the main physical activity to be stressed is low impact (e.g.  yoga , walking ), we 
do not anticipate that the health risks will be over and above the risks normally 
associated with daily activities .

   Retrospective data collection and/or specimens obtained from medical chart 
review/data access.  Describe how data will be obtained (e.g., fileman, CDW, etc.):  We 
will review medical chart data to check if parti cipants meet inclusion criteria . We will also 
perform a data pull of potentially eligible participants using VINCI , using approved VA 
procedures. Potentially eligible participant data will be pulled and transferred to a secure 
Durham VAMC  server .  As the potential study pool may be large but  the study number 
is small , the data pull will pull small batches of names and IDs to review and screen, 
before additional names are pulled until enrollment is complete.  
  Retrospective data collection and/or specimens obtained from an IRB -approved 
data and/or specimen repository.  Indicate the repository source including name, VA 
location, and IRB number:       . 
Note:  for data and/or specimens obtained from a VA approved data repository, a Data 
Use Agreement (DUA) must be executed prior to obtaining data and/or specimens.  See 
VHA Handbook 1200.12 for further informa tion.

  Limited Data Set  
  Other: Describe:        
 
4. Location of Data and/or Specimens, and Data Retention Plan:   
A. Data will be stored electronically in \\vhadurhsrdfile1 \$projects . If a tracking database 
is developed for the study, at \\vhadurhsrdfile1 \$research \Distributed 
Apps \HSRDTrackingApp.  Data that will be stored electronically include patient 
demographics, survey data and data from in -person sessions. The data will be stored 
on a s ecure VAserver (Durham VAMC building 1, room FG104)  and backed up on a 
regular schedule .  
  Data will also be placed at the VA Informatics and Computing Interface (VINCI; 
http://vaww.vinci.med.va.gov/vincicen tral/VINCIWorkspace.aspx ). The VA Informatics 
and Computing Infrastructure is a partnership between the VA Office of Information 
Technology and the Veterans’ Health Administration Office of Research and 
Development.  Researchers and operations staff can us e VINCI to access data and 
statistical analysis tools in a virtual working environment through a certified VHA 
network computer using the VA Intranet or Virtual Private Network (VPN).  
B. Data Retention Plan  
 Research records will be maintained and destroyed according to the National 
Archives and Records Administration, Records Schedule Number:  DAA -0015 -2015 -
0004.  Records destruction, when authorized, will be accomplished using the then 
current requirements for the secure disposal of paper and electronic records.  Currently, 
 Buddies – Goldstein  
8/10/2018 Version 3  
Page 14 of 19 
 destruction of research records (see DAA -0015 -2015 -0004, section 7.6 “Research 
Investigator Files” for materials included in research records) is scheduled f or 6 years 
after the cut -off (the cut -off is the completion of the research project) and may be 
retained longer if required by [CONTACT_2326].  Records will not be destroyed 
without pre -notification to the facility records manager.   
  Other data retention plan, describe:        
 
5. Data Access and Data Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]:   Only members of our VAMC research team 
will have access to identifiers and coded data.  Study staff at other VA sites will 
access the data stored on a Durham VA server through a link provided to them. 
They will have access to a study folder that is behin d the VA firewall.  
 
All VA research personnel who have access to VHA records are instructed, in 
accordance with VA policy, on the requirements of Federal privacy and information laws 
and regulations, VA regulations and policies, and VHA policy. All study personnel who

other VA security and privacy policy training requirements and have agreed to follow 
guidelines pertaining to the protection of patient data. All research sta ff sign VA Rules of 
Behavior, and all study staff are up -to-date with VHA Privacy Policy Training and the VA 
Office of Cyber and Information Security Awareness Training Course. The data security 
and privacy procedures summarized in that course include logg ing off or locking the 
computer when walking away from it; no sharing of access codes, verify codes or 
passwords; not allowing anyone else to use the computer under one’s password; and 
disposing of sensitive information using VA -approved methods (e.g., shr edder bins). 
Access to study data will be removed for all study personnel when they are no longer 
part of the research team. A partial off -site waiver has been obtained to conduct study 
group meetings at an off -site location (Duke Sara W. Stedman Nutrition  and Metabolism 
Center ). No data will be stored there. A limited amount of phi (sign in sheets, retrieval of 
participants ’ paper call logs  or self -questionnaires ) will be transported to and from this 
site. Study staff will secure the data by [CONTACT_267821].

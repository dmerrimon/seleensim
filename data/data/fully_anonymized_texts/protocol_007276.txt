acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of 
rADAMTS -13 (SHP655) administered in addition to standard of care (SoC) treatment
Short title: A Phase 2, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind study of r ADAMTS -13(SHP655) in the 
treatment of patients with aTTP

Number of subjects (total and pertreatm ent arm):
Approximately 30 in total and 10 per treatment arm
Inves tigator(s): multicenter study
Site(s) and Region(s): 
Approximately 20 sites in the USandEU areplanned .
Study period (planned):
2019- 2021Clinical phase: 2
Objectives:
Co-Prim ary: 
1. Assess the PK of ADAMTS -13in aTTP subjects treated for an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_49071] 
(PEX), immunosuppressant therapy, with or w ithout SHP655 supplementation
2. Study the PK/PD relationship betw een ADAMTS -13levels and pathophysiological biomarkers, as well as

Secondary: 
PK/PD Objectives
1. Evaluate changes in levels of ADAMTS -13binding and inhibitory autoantibod iesin response to daily PEX, 
with or without SHP655 supplementation , during the acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_49072] 30 days after the resolution of 
the TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]
2. Evaluate ADAMTS -13activity levels in subjects up to 30 days after TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_7292]
3. Specify dose(s) of SHP655 needed to achieve and maintain adequate plasma levels of r ADAMTS -13in order 
to support induction of remission and to reduce the number of PEX procedures needed for the treatment of 
acute aTTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_49073] /Efficacy Objectives
1. Assess the safety and immunogenicity of two regimens of SHP655 supplementation administered during an 
acute TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_49074], changes in vital signs and laboratory parameters
2. Evaluate the occurrences of aTTP related complications, (including death, stroke, MI, and organ failure), 
aTTP relapses*, exacerbations** and end-organ function improvement
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51538] 2018
3. Evaluate the time to aTTP related complications (including death, stroke, MI, and organ failure), aTTP 
relapses*, exacerbations** and end -organ function improvement
4. Evaluate the occurrence of procedure (e.g. PEX, SHP655 infusions ) related adverse events
Exploratory Objectives:
*Defined as >30 days after achieving remission
**Defined as ≤30 days after achieving remission
Rationale:
This study is needed to enable detailed assess ment of ADAMTS -13activity in aTTP subjects in the context of PEX , 
rADAMTS -13supplementation and anti -ADAMTS -13autoantibodies, all of which will acutely change plasma 
ADAMTS -13activity. 
The relationship between recovery of ADAMTS -13activity and improvement in clinical outcomes wil l be explored. 
PK/PDanalysis will be utilized to establish an SHP655 dosing regimen that assures achievement of adequate 
ADAMTS -13activity levels ,thus enabling a reduction in the number of PEX, a hypothesis which will be tested in 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] [ADDRESS_51539], dose, and m ode of administration:
 SHP655 40 IU/kg once daily , i.v. or 40IU/kg, b.i.d., i.v.
 Placebo (0.9% saline)
Study Design
Subjects experiencing the onset of an acute TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] w ill receive a single PEX as part of SoC as soon as 
feasible, consent will be obtained ,and subjects will undergo screening procedures. Eligible subjects w ill 
provisionally be randomized into one of three treatment arms, w ith a total enrollment of approximately [ADDRESS_51540] 2 on-study PEX (after the first SoC PEX) w ill be 1.5 plasma volume, follow ed by  [CONTACT_49114] 
1.0plasma volume exchanges. 
Arm  1 -SoC (n=10)
Subjects will receive daily PEX and will also receive placebo immediately after each PEX and at 12±1 hours after 
completion of each PEX. 
Arm  2 -SoC with Supple mentation once daily (n=10)
Subjects will receive daily PEX and will also receive 40 IU/kg SHP655 immediately after each PEX and placebo at 
12±1 hours after completion of each PEX. 
Arm 3 -SoC with Supple mentation twice daily (n=10)
Subjects will receive daily PEX and will also receive 40 IU/kg SHP655 immediately after each PEX and at 
12±1 hours after completion of each PEX. 
Supplementation with SHP655 or placebo as appropriate will continue until all remission cri teria are met: platelet 
count ≥150,000/μL and confirmati on by a second platelet count ≥150,000/μL and LDH <[ADDRESS_51541] 48 hours following 
initial normalization.  Furthermore, dosing will also be discontinued based on pre -PEX ADAMT S-13activity levels 
as described later in this section.
If screening laboratory tests show :
 ADAMTS -13activity >10%; or
 The absence of anti -ADAMTS -13autoantibodies; or
 The presence of a known genetic mutation on both alleles consistent with cTTP
The sub ject w ill be discontinued from the study. A follow up safety visit will be scheduled 30 ±[ADDRESS_51542] w ill be excluded from the PK and efficacy analyses.
An immunosuppressive regimen of 1 g methylpredn isolone iv once daily for 3 consecutive days, followed by 
2.5mg/kg/day, and 375 mg/m2rituximab administered w eekly  for 4 w eeks will be initiated w ithin 2 days of 
enrollment for all subjects. Steroid tapering is permitted per local SoC. Additional immunos uppressive therapy can 
be considered after consultation with the sponsor.
Subjects in e ach study arm will receive a dose of IP immediately after and at 12±1 hours after each PEX. 
In all study arms, the second daily dose (SHP655 or placebo 12h after PEX ) will be terminated if a local lab 
pre-PEX ADAMTS -13activity level is >150% or above the upper limit of quantification.  
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51543] 2018
If the second dose has already been suspended and a subsequent local lab pre -PEX ADAMTS -13 activity level is 
>150% or above the upper limit of quantification, the first daily dose (SHP655 or placebo immediately after PEX ) 
will be terminated.
After resolution of the TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], subjects w ill be given additional IP (placebo for Arm 1, SHP655 40 IU/kg for 
Arms 2 and 3) once w eekly if weekly ADAMTS -13activity at the local lab is <50% .

2. INTRODUCTION
Baxalta US Inc. (Baxalta), now part of Shire, has developed a recombinant A Disintegrin and 
Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Ty pe-1 Motifs 13 candidate (r ADAMTS -13, now 
designated as SHP655; formerl y designated as BAX 930) for treating subjects with thrombotic 
thrombocy topenic purpura (TTP). 
TTP may  occur in congenital (cTTP) or acquired (aTTP) 
forms. In aTTP, autoantibodies inhibit and/or accelerate clearance of ADAMTS - 13. A severe 
deficiency  of ADAMTS -13leads to an accumulation of high molecular weight von Willebrand 
Factor ( VWF ) and a thrombotic microangiopath y (TMA) whose hallmarks are severe 
thrombocy topenia and schistocy tosis. Clinical features that accompany  the TMA classicall y are 
described as the pentad of fever, neurologic changes, renal insufficiency , thrombocy topenia, and 
microangiopathic hemoly tic anemia .Due to the lethality  of untreated aTTP, treatment often
commences with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_49077], prior to laboratory  confirmation of ADAMTS -13
deficiency . 
The overall goal of this study  is to assess ADAMTS -13activity  in aTTP subjects in the context 
of plasma exchange ( PEX ) treatment , supplementation with r ADAMTS-[ADDRESS_51568] version of the SHP655 investigator’s brochure (IB) for the over all risk/benefit 
assessment and the most accurate and current information regarding the pharmacokinetics, 
efficacy , and safet y of SHP655.
2.1Indication and Current Treatment Options 
2.1.[ADDRESS_51569] of Care (SoC)
Daily  PEX is the cornerstone of the present standard of care ( SoC)(Rock et al., 1991 ).
Immunomodulatory  drugs, such as corticosteroids, rituximab, vincristine, cy closporine, 
cyclophosphamide as well as splenectomy , are recommended to reduce the production of 
autoantibodies for sustained remission (Saha et al., 2017 ).Other novel therapeutic modalities, 
such as a nanobod y (caplacizumab) targeting the interaction between platelet gl ycoprotein Ib
(GPI b) and VWF multimers, are in development.

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51570] 2018
[IP_ADDRESS] Plasma Exchange (PEX)
PEX became recognized as the SoC in 1991, following the publication of the landmark study  of 
102 adult TTP patients, in which PEX was more effective than plasma infusion in the treatment 
of TTP (Rock et al., 1991 ). This study  showed a response rate (defined as a platelet count of 
>150 × 109/L and no new neurological events) b y day 9 of 47% for PEX versus 25% for plasma 
infusion, P = 0.025, and 6
-month survival of 78% for PEX versus 63% for plasma infusion, 
respectivel y, P = 0.04. Since then, PEX has reduced the mortality  rate from up to 95% to 
10–20% (Zheng, 2015 ).
As soon as a diagnosis of an acute TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_49078], PEX with frozen or 
solvent detergent plasma (both contain ingnormal levels of 
ADAMTS -13, i.e., approximately  
1μg/mL) should be initiated (Allford et al., 2000
, Rock et al., 2006) to replenish ADAMTS -13
activity  and remove anti -ADAMTS -13auto- antibodies (Kremer Hovinga et al., 2017 , 
Rock et al., 1991 ). 
A daily  PEX at 1 to 1.5 times the patient’s predicted plasma volume is generall y given until 
clinical features related to organ manifestations (e.g., neurologic s ymptoms, increas ed troponin 
level, renal failure, abdominal pain due to enteritis or pancreatitis) are resolved, the platelet count 
and LDH are normalized, and hemoly sis stops (Joly et al., 2017 , Knöbl, 2014) .A published [LOCATION_006] 
TTP guideline recommends that PEX should be continued for a minimum of 2 day s after the 
platelet count is normalized (
>150 x 109/L)(Scully  et al., 2012 ).
After remission, a therapeutic PEX taper is sometimes used in clinical practice. 
However, there wa s no statistical difference in relapse rates comparing the taper and 
non-taper sub -groups, in a retrospective anal ysis of 115 patients with initial presentations 
of aTTP (Bandarenko and Brecher, 1998 , Zheng, 2015) .
[IP_ADDRESS] Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids have long been utilized along with PEX as frontline therapy . Importantly , 
before the widespread use of PEX, response rates of 30/54 (55%) were reported among patients 
without considerable organ damage within 48- 72 hours with the use of corticosteroids alone
(Scully  et al., 2012 ). A randomized, controlled trial comparing high- dose (10 mg/kg/d) and 
standard -dose (1 mg/kg/d) methy lprednisolone as adjunct therapy  to PEX in 60 newly  diagnosed 
aTTP pa tients demonstrated 77% and 47% remission rates respectively (Balduini et al., 2010 ). 
The British TTP guidelines recommend the use of glucocorticoids (1 mg of oral prednisone per 
kilogram daily ; or 1 g of methy lprednisolone per day  for three consecutive day s) for all patients 
with aTTP (Scully  et al., 2012 ).

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51571] 2018
[IP_ADDRESS] Rituximab
Rituximab (humanized anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody ) was first used in patients with 
suboptimal responses to PEX (i.e., exacerbation or refractoriness), t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_22003] a dose of 
375mg/m2in 4 weekly  doses) with excellent (89%) remission rates (Joly et al., 2017 ).These 
very positive results prompted an increase in frontlin e use of rituximab, which results in shorter 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49079] (Scull y et al., 2011, Vazquez -Mellado et al., 2016) .
Response to rituximab was associated with a decrease in the anti -ADAMTS -13antibodies with a 
resulting increase in the ADAMTS -13activit y(Cataland and Wu, 2015) . Earlier administration 
(within 3 days) was associated with faster achievement of remission (12 vs. 20 day s, P < 0.001), 
fewer PEX (16 vs. 24, P = 0.03) and shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  (16 vs. 23 day s, P = 0.01)
(Westwood et al., 2013) .
In addition, rituximab improved re lapse -free survival when used for proph ylactic treatment of 
patients with a history  of aTTP and persistent ADAMTS -13activity  less than 10% in clinical 
remission (Hie et al., 2014 , Westwood et al., 2013) . Rituximab prophy laxis was associated with 
normalization of ADAMTS -
13levels within 3 months in all but one case, with only  one acute 
relapse at follow -up(Westwood et al., 2013) .
[IP_ADDRESS] Investigational Drugs
There is ongoi ng clinical evaluation of caplacizumab, an anti- VWF nanobody  that inhibits the 
binding between platelet GPI b receptor and ULVWF multimers, thereby  [CONTACT_49118], with the aim of decreasing the time to normalization of 
platelet count during PEX. In the Phase 2, controlled study , 75patients underwent randomization 
(36 were assigned to receive caplacizumab, and 39 to receive placebo). The time to a response 
was significantl y reduced with caplacizumab as compared with placebo (39% reduction in 
median time, P = 0.005). Three patients in the caplacizumab group had an exacerbation, as 
compared with [ADDRESS_51572] month after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_49080], of whom 7 had ADAMTS - 13 activity  
that remained below 10%, suggesting unresolved autoimmune activity . Bleeding -related adverse 
events (AEs), most of which were mild to moderate in severit y, were more common with 
caplacizumab than with placebo ( 54% of patients vs. 38%) ( Peyvandi et al., 2016 ).
Although caplacizumab blocks the formation of microthrombi, it does not address the underl ying 
pathophy siology , the ADAMTS -13deficiency (Cataland and Wu, 2015) . Clinical events 
including relapse, exacerbation, and organ damage may  occur once it is discontinued if the 
potential to form the microthrombi remains. For instance, 22% on the caplacizumab and none on 
the placebo arms of the Phase [ADDRESS_51573] month after discontinuing the 
therap y(Peyvandi et al., 2016 ).

2.1.2 Unmet Medical Needs of Current Therapy
With current therap y, acute mortali ty rate of aTTP is still 10 -20% (Alwan F et al., 2016 ),andin 
high-risk patients (ol der age, multiple organ involvement at presentation, etc.) it may  reach 
30-60% (Benhamou et al., 2012 ).
Although PEX is the standard treatment for TTP, it is frequentl y associated with complications 
related to both the procedure and the large volumes of plasma t o which the patient is exposed. 
These complications include catheter- related sepsis, venous thrombosis, pneumothorax, 
hemorrhage, h ypotension, allergic and anaph ylactic reaction, citrate i ntolerance, and volume 
overload (Koyfman et al., 2011, Reutter et al., 2001) .
Adverse events were reported as complications in about 26% of the PEX procedures
(George, 2007
).In a nine -year cohort study  of 206 consecutive patients treated for TTP, five 
patients (2%) died of complications of PEX treatment; three patients died from hemorrhage 
related to the insertion of a central venous catheter and two from catheter -related sepsis. Fift y-
three other patients had major complications attributed to PEX treatment, including s ystemic 
infection, venous thrombosis, and hy potension that required treatment. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_49081] p rogress in plasma safety, infectious risk associated wit h blood- borne 
pathogens remains (Bryant and Klein, 2007 , Humpe et al., 2000) .Also, long -term PEX may  
become especiall y problematic in pat ients with poor venous access. Furthermore, PEX is 
associated with high healthcare resource utilization, is time consuming , special ized equipment 
and trained staff, and can be stressful for patients.  
Recurrence (reemergence of clinical and laboratory  signs and s ymptoms of TTP after the 
remission) has been reported in 20 to 50% of cases (Peyvandi et al., 2008 ).Most recurrences 
occur within t he first year after the acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_49082]. Exacerbation 
within 30 days of remission occurs in up to 50% of aTTP patients in spi[INVESTIGATOR_49083], and 
relapses have been reported in 20 to 40% of ca ses. Refractory  disease occurs 
in up to 10% of 
aTTP patients regardless of intensive PEX ( Coppo and Vey radier, 2012 ).
Even among patients who do not relapse, man y experience a lower qualit y of life (QoL) 
interms of general and mental health, and may  continue to experience pain in the long run
(Lewis et al., 2009
). Patients in remission may  suffer from lingering neurocognitive impairment
(
Han et al., 2015, Kessler et al., 2012 ).In one study following patients recovering from TTP for 
up to 16 years, the prevalence of h ypertension, depression, and risk of death wer e increased
(Deford et al., 2013 ).These underscore not onl y the ongoing therapeutic challe nge in the 
treatment of the initial acute event, but also the need to decrease the long -term morbidity  seen 
after its resolution.

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51575] Background and Clinical Information .
The active drug substance of SHP655, produced in a Chinese Hamster Ovary  (CHO) ma mmalian 
expression sy stem in a plasma -protein- free milieu, is the fully  glycosylated recombinant human 
ADAMTS -13 protein that has undergone two dedicated virus reduction steps, solvent detergent 
[S/D] treatment and nanofiltration.
Preclinical studies show efficacy  in aTTP. When TTP was triggered using 2000 U/kg rVWF in 
the presence of pol yclonal antibody to ADAMTS -13in SD rats , the animals display ed severe 
TTP-like sy mptoms, such as thrombocy topenia, hemoly tic anemia, and VWF –rich thrombi in the 
kidney s and brain. Subsequent injection 
SHP655 prevented development of these s ymptoms. 
Analy sis of plasma samples confirmed that SHP655 was able to override circulatin g anti -
ADAMTS -13inhibitory  antibodies, resulting in restoration of ADAMTS -13activity  and 
degradation of ultra -large VWF multimers ( Plaimauer et al., 2011 , Plaimauer et al., 2015 ,  
Tersteeg et al., 2015 , Tersteeg et al., 2016 ).
Results from the Phase [ADDRESS_51576] (IP). 
2.3Study Rationale
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_49084] e knowledge of the pathophy siology  of aTTP, the acute mortality  rate has 
remained 10-20% for over twent y years(Alwan F et al., 2016 ). Moreover, TTP patients suffer 
from numerous devastating morbiditie s and decreased qualit y of life (Deford et al., 2013 , 
Tersteeg et al., 2016 ).SHP655, has demonstrate d efficacy  of restoring VWF -cleaving activity  in 
vitro in the presence of anti- ADAMTS - [ADDRESS_51577] 2018
Such improvements in the therap y for aTTP patients are potentiall y reducing short -and long -
term clinical complications including neurological impairment, renal failure, my ocardial damage 
and str okeand improve quality  of life.
This study  is needed to assess 
ADAMTS -13activity  in aTTP subjects in the context of SHP655 
dosing, PEX and anti -ADAMTS -13autoantibodies, allof which will acutely  change plasma 
ADAMTS -13activit y. The relationship between recovery  of ADAMTS -13activity  and 
improvement in clinical outcomes will be explored. A PK anal ysis will be utilized to establish an 
SHP655 dosing regimen that achieves efficacious ADAMTS -13activit y levels with a reduce d 
number of PEX for use in future studies.
2.4Benefit/Risk Assessment 
SHP655 appeared to be safe and well tolerated following a single administration over a dose 
range of 5 to 40 U/kg in cTTP patients in Study  281101, and there was no evidence of an 
immune r esponse to SHP655. The activit y PK parameters were comparable to those estimated 
from fresh frozen plasma ( FFP)studies and demonstrated dose proportionality  with respect to 
Cmaxand AUC. Finally , there was evidence for SHP655 activity  in vivo , including e ffects on 
VWF multimers, platelet count, and serum LDH. Overall, the data obtained in the first -in-human 
Phase [ADDRESS_51578] a positive benefit:risk ratio for patients with con genital TTP. Because the primary  defect, 
i.e. 
ADAMTS -13deficiency , is the same in congenital and acquired TTP, r ADAMTS -[ADDRESS_51579] version of the SHP655 investigator’s brochure (IB)for the overall benefit/risk

4.STUDY DESIGN
4.1Overall Design 
This is a randomized, parallel, placebo -controlled, double -blind Phase 2 study . Approximately  
30evaluable subjects between the ages of 18 to 75 y
ears experiencing an acute TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_49092] a single PEX, and be randomized 1:1:1 into one of three tr eatment arms:
Arm 1 
–SoC plus placebo (n=10)
Subjects will receive daily PEX and placebo immediately  after PEX and 12±1 hours after 
completion of PEX. 
Arm 2 – SoC with SHP655 once dail y (n=10)
Subjects will receive daily PEX and 40 IU/kg SHP655 once daily  immediately  after PEX and 
placebo 12±1 hours after completion of PEX.
Arm 3 – SoC with SHP655 twice dail y (n=10)
Subjects will receive daily plasma exchange and 40 IU/kg SHP655 twice daily  immediatel y after 
PEX and 12±[ADDRESS_51588] SHP655 dose may be given up to 4 hours after the initial SoC PEX that occurs before 
study  entry , but preferably  as soon as possible after the initial PEX. 
An immunosuppressive regimen consists of methylprednisolone and rituximab: 
1 g met hylprednisolone iv once dail y for 3 consecutive days, followed by  2.5 mg/kg/day ;and 
375 mg/m2 rituximab administered weekl y for 4 weeks will be initiated within 2 day s of 
enrollment for all subjects. Steroid tapering is permitted at the discretion of the investigator . 
Additional or modified immunosuppressive therapy  can be considered in exceptional 
circumstances after consultation with the sponsor .
In all study  Arms, the second daily  IP dose (12 hours after PEX) will be terminated if the most 
recently  resu ltedpre-PEX ADAMTS -13activity  level is >150% or above the limit of 
quantification (local lab). After the second dose has been suspended, the first daily  IP dose 
(immediately  after PEX) will be terminated if the most recentl y resulted pre-PEX ADAMTS -13
activity  level is >150% or above the limit of quantification (local lab) .
In all study  Arms, planned modifications to the plasma volume treated with each PEX (e.g. 
1.5or 2 plasma volumes) or the frequency  of PEX (e.g. BID or every  other day ) require sponsor
approval. Changes in PEX treatment due to logistical or emergent issues (e.g. venous access 
problems, A es leading to PEX discontinuation) do not require sponsor approval but must be 
documented .

After resolution of the TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], I P (placebo in Arm 1; SHP655 40 I U/kg Arms 2 and 3) will 
be administered once weekly  (maximum of 4 weekly  doses of 40 IU/kg) if ADAMTS -13activit y 
at the local lab is <50%. Activity  must be measured at least once weekl y and >72h after the last 
IP dose.
4.2Scientific Rationale for Study Design
4.2.[ADDRESS_51590], a double blinded 
placebo minimizes bias in AE reporting that could be influenced by  [CONTACT_49119] . Second, it minimizes bias in treatment decisions , PK blood sampling, and other 
procedures that could be influenced b y knowledge of treatment allocation.
4.3Justification for Dose
The dosing regimen of 40 IU/kg was selected based on the Phase 1 single -dose study  of SHP655 
in subjects with cTTP ( Study  281101). This dose was safe and well tolerated and is further 
supported by  [CONTACT_105]
-clinical safet y studies (s ee 5.3.1 Non-clinical Studies).
In the Phase 1 stud y the pharmacokinetics of ADAMTS -13was characterized in cTTP patients 
with no detectable anti- ADAMTS -13antibodies. The mean terminal half -life was 59.2 hours 
using the FRETS -VWF73 assay . The geometric mean of IR was 0.0232 (U/mL  x kg/U). 
Thegeometric mean C maxafter a 40 U/kg infusion was 0.948 U/mL  and the AUC (0-inf) was 
53.1 U ∙h/mL . In an aTTP population which will have the anti -ADAMTS -[ADDRESS_51591] , a second regimen will be tested at 40 IU/Kg twice 
daily .
The proposed dosing supplementation regimen of SHP655 is not predicted to y ield ADAMTS -13
activity  levels that will exceed a safe threshold, even in a cTTP patient mistakenly  diagnosed 
with aTTP. Daily  PEX with donor plasma that has a presumed ADAMTS -13activity  of 100% 
will help normalize any  excessively  low or high ADAMTS -13level.

6.6 Plasma Exchange (PEX)
PEX procedures will be performed per the local SoC using the locall y available automated 
apheresis device with citrat e anticoagulant. Replacement fluid will be the plasma ty pe(s) 
available through the local blood bank. Fresh frozen plasma, thawed plasma, solvent -detergent 
plasma, and cry oprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] -poor plasma are acceptable. Replacement with normal saline or 
albumin solutions are permitted per local SoC. 
The first PEX prior to IP administration will be performed according to the local SoC. 
The first two PEX procedures on study  (3rdPEX overall) will be 1.5 plasma volumes (per 
Rock et al., 1991 ). The 3rdand subsequent on-study  PEX procedures will be 1.[ADDRESS_51616] be pre -appro ved by  
[CONTACT_456]. In extenuating
cases, urgent, unapproved changes to the PEX regimen may  be 
required for optimal patient care, e.g. emergent stroke or MI. 
The following PEX parameters will be recorded for each PEX procedure:
Calculated plasma volume according to apheresis device
Plasma volume exchanged
Volume of anticoagulant used
Volumes and ty pes of replacement fluid(s) exchanged
Blood loss (if applicable)
Time of PEX (time connected to apheresis device)
Adverse events related to apheresis catheters, venous access, and/orPEX will be recorded as 
(S)A es and managed per the local SoC. Citrate toxicity  is recommended to be treated with 
pausing of the apheresis procedure and administration of iv calcium preparation. Low plasma 
ionized calcium concentrations are supportive evidence of citrate reactions but arenot required 
for diagnosis. 
All transfusion reactions of an y severity must be 
documented and reported to the blood bank. 
Transfusion reactions will be managed according to the local SoC. It will be recorded whether 
PEX -related Aes lead to delay s in the PEX procedure, an aborted procedure, and /oradditional 
procedures (e.g. central venous catheter interventions, escalation in care ).

DISCONTINUATION/WITH DRAWAL
7.1Discontinuation of Study Treatment
If investigational product is discontinued, regardless of the reason (unless as specified in the 
protocol), the evaluations listed for the Completion/Termination Visit willbe performed as 
completely  as possible. Whenever possible, all discontinued subjects should also undergo the 
protocol -specified evaluations at(completion/termination visit) . Comments (spontaneous or 
elicited) or complaints made b y the subject must be recorded in the source documents. The 
reason for discontinuation, date of discontinuation of the investigational product, and the total 
amount of investigational product administered must be recorded in the source documents.
Subjects who discontinue will be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor. 
7.2Reasons for Discontinuation 
The reason for discontinuation must be determined by  [CONTACT_49122]’s source document. I f a subject is discontinued for more than [ADDRESS_51624] clinically  relevant reason should be indicated. 
Reasons for discontinuation include, but are not limited to:
Not meeting c onfirmatory  inclusion criteria, i.e. screening ADAMTS -13>10% at sponsor 
bioanaly tic lab , no ADAMTS - 13 inhibitory  antibody , or genetic mutatio n indicating 
congenital TTP
Adverse event
Protocol deviation
Withdrawal by  [CONTACT_1130]

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51625] may  withdraw from the study  at any  time and for any  reason without prejudice to 
his/her future medical care b y the ph ysician or at the institution, or may  be withdrawn at an y 
time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor (eg, in the interest of subject safet y). The 
investigator is encouraged to discuss withdrawal of a subject with the medical monitor when 
possible.
If 1) the subject withdraws or 2) a subject is not confirmed to be a case of aTTP because of 
ADAMTS -13activit y >10%, absence of anti- ADAMTS -13autoantibody , or genetic 
confirmation of congenital TTP, I P administration and study  procedures will stop, with the 
exception of a Termination/Completion Visit, which should occur within 1 week after the final 
dose of IP.
7.4 Subjects “Lost to Follow- up” Prior to the Last Scheduled Visit
A minimum of [ADDRESS_51626] (office visit or telephone c ontact). 
At least [ADDRESS_51627]’s last known address via courier or mail (with an acknowledgement of receipt request) 
asking that the subject return to the site for final safet y eval uations and return any  unused 
investigational product.

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51628] who has given informed consent and failed to meet the inclusion 
and/or met at least [ADDRESS_51629] is considered enrolle d once the ICF is signed. Subjects may  not re -enroll if previously  
randomized in this study . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Screenin g/Baseline Visit
Informed consent must be obtained by [CONTACT_29159]’s legally  authorized 
representative before subjects are asked to prepare for an y screening procedures.
Because of the need for urgent treatment, there is no baseline visit. Rather, baseline 
measurements are to be collected as part of the screening procedures. Screening and baseline 
assessments should be completed prior the initial SoC PEX , but the initial SoC PEX must not be 
delay ed in order to accommodate screening procedures. 
8.1.2 Treatment Period 
After screening, subjects will be randomly  assigned to 1 of 3 Arms by  a computer algorithm. In 
the event that enrollment in an Arm is full, subjects will be randomly  assigned to the remaining 
Arm(s).
The treatment period begins after randomization with the first I P infusion up to 4 hours after the 
initial PEX, but preferably  as soon as possible . For all Arms after remission is achieved, blinded 
IP supplementation is administered weekl y for ADAMTS -13activity  levels <50% (measured 
>[ADDRESS_51630] dose of IP).
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51631] 2018
PEX will occur once daily during the treatment period. If the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_49099], it is preferred that the volume of plasma treated 
be escalated to 1.5 or 2 plasma volumes before the frequency  of PEX is increased. A planned 
increase in the frequency of treatment volume of PEX requires sponsor approval. Additional 
PEX after remission is not permitted.
[IP_ADDRESS] Final Visit 
The Final Visit is the Completion/Termination Visit.
8.1.[ADDRESS_51632] will not receive 
additional I P, and treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_978] . During the treatment of a recurrence, 
subjects will follow the bi- weekl y visit schedule and study  procedures per Table 1until 
remission is achieved or 4 months after the initial remission, whichever is sooner.
At the end of this period will be the Completion/Termin ation Visit . All A es and SAEs that are

8.2.2 Efficacy
The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) 
assessments will be performed dail y while inpatient until the subject performs in the normal 
range for two consecutive day s on each scale. Once the subject performs in the no rmal range on 
two consecutive day s on a scale, the assessment scale is discontinued. Scales may  be performed 
during the treatment period 
and for the first 4 weekly follow up visits . For the MoCA, the normal 
range is a score of 26 -30.A subjects’ inability  to perform the MoCA will be documented by  
[CONTACT_49124]. For the RASS, a normal score is zero. Assessments are to be performed during the 
daytime at a similar time of day , where feasible. MoCA and RASS may  be recorded directl y into 
the CRF.
Occurrence of stroke, MI, neurologic deficits, cognitive deficits, and renal insufficiency  will be 
documented dail y as present/absent based on local laboratory  results and local consultants, as 
appropriate for the local SoC. I f present, 1) a narrative desc ription will be provided at the time of 
diagnosis; 2) the status of present or absent will be documented dail y.
Occurrence of exacerbation or relapse will be determined by
 [CONTACT_49125] a major clinical event ( e.g. MI,stroke, death) deemed b y the investigator to be 
related to aTTP. Exacerbation is defined as recurrent thrombocy topenia following a response and 
requiring a reinitiation of daily  plasma exchange treatment after ≥ 1 day  but ≤ 30 day s of no 
plasma exchange t reatment.
8.2.3 Safety
Safet y will be assessed by [CONTACT_49126], clinical chemistry , hematology , clinicall y 
relevant bleeding (modified ITP score) or thrombosis at the site of line insertion, adverse 
reactions to plasma, including citrate reactions, all ergic reactions, and TRALI. Adverse Events 
(Aes) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be assessed. The modified ITP Bleeding Score 
will be assessed b y the study staff dail y until remission is achieved.
Central and local laboratories will be used for all laborator y values required per protocol.

and at subsequent stud y visits will be recorded in the subject’s source documents.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered IP that does not 
necessarily  have a causal rel ationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any  
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), sy mptom (e.g., 
rash, pain, discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.), or disease (eg, peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.) 
temporally  associated with the use of an IP, whether or not related to the IP. An AE includes any  
event, regardless of the presumed causality  between the event and the IP. 
Events that do not necessarily  meet the definition of A e
s, regardless of causal association with 
IP, should be treated as A es because they  may  be reportable to Regulatory Authorities according 
to AE reporting regulation; these include the following:
IP overdose, whether accidental or intentional
IP abuse
An event occurring from IP withdrawal
Any failure of expected pharmacological action
Exposure to I P during pregnancy
Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from the I P
Medication errors (i.e., incorrect route of administration, incorrect dosage, use of incorrect 
product)

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51636] I P 
exposure are collected under other stud y outcome measures and thus are not reportable on the 
AE CRF if related to a TTP event, nor will they  be included in the analy sis of A es:
1.Increase of serum creatinine 
2.Elevation of LDH >2×ULN
3.Neurological s ymptoms (e.g., confusion, visual changes, dy sphonia, paresthesias, 
dysarthria, focal or general motor sy mptoms)
4.Abnormal ADAMTS -13activity
5.Positive anti -ADAMTS -13inhibitor
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs
Vital signs will be assessed at each visit, if not stated otherwise:
Blood pressure: Sy stolic/diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) baseline measurements will be 
measured after a [ADDRESS_51637] in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/semirecumbent position.
Pulse rate: Pulse rate (beats/m in) will be measured at the distal radial arteries under the 
same conditions as above.
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842]: Respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842] (breaths/min) will be measured over a period of 1 minute 
under the same conditions as above.
Temperature: Bod y temperature (°C or °F) may be determined b y oral, rectal, axillary, or 
tympanic measurement at the discretion of the investigator. However, the same method 
should be used for all measurements in [ADDRESS_51638].
During the treatment period, vital signs will be assessed 30±15 minutes prior to and 
30±[ADDRESS_51639] I P infusion on study  and 30±15 minutes prior to and 
30±[ADDRESS_51640] -PEX I P infusion each day  thereafter. 
Vital sign values are to be recorded on the vital signs CRF. For each abnormal vital sign value, 
the investigator will determine whether the value is considered an AE (see definition in 
Appendix 2.1). I f assessed as an AE, the medical diagnosis (preferabl y), symptom, or sign, will 
be recorded on the AE CRF. If the abnormal value was not deemed an AE because it was due 
toan error, due to a preexisting disease (described in
 Appendix 2.1), not clinically  significant, 
asymptom of a new/worsened condition already  recorded as an AE, or due to another issue 
thatwill be specified, the investigator will record t he justification on the vital signs CRF.

Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology  of an 
abnormal result, or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically  indicated.
Any abnormal value tha t persists should be followed at the discretion of the investigator.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Tests
All clinical laboratory  tests will be performed according to the laboratory ’s standard procedures. 
Reference ranges willbe supplied by  [CONTACT_49127] t o assess the results for clinical 
significance and out -of-range changes which may be associated with, or constitute, an AE. The 
investigator should assess out -
of-range clinical laboratory  values for clinical significance, 
indicating if the value(s) is/are not clinicall y significant or clinicall y significant. Abnormal 
clinical laboratory  values, which are unexpected or not explained by  [CONTACT_423]’s clinical 
condition, may , at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor, be repeated as soon as possible 
until confirmed, explained, or resolved. The hematology  panel consists of complete blood count 
[hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocy tes (i.e., red blood cell count), and leukocy tes (i.e., white

APPENDIX 2  ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFI NITIONS AND PROCEDUR ES FOR 
RECORDING, EVALUATING, FOLLOW -UP, AND REPORTING
Appendix 2.1  Adverse Event Definitions
An adverse event (AE) is any  untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a p harmaceutical product and that does not necessarily  have a causal relationship 
with this investigational product or medicinal product. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including a clinically  significant laboratory  finding), sy mptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
causalit y is suspected (I CH Guidance E2A 1995).
Treatment -emergent Adverse Event
A treatment -
emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an y event em erging or manifesting at 
or after the initiation of treatment with an investigational product or medicinal product or an y 
existing event that worsens in either intensity  or frequency  following exposure to the 
investigational product or medicinal product.
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any  untoward clinical manifestation of signs, sy mptoms or 
outcomes (whether considered related to investigational product or not and at any  dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening. Note: The term “li fe-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]. Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49107] y scheduled investigations procedures or surgery for 
pre-existing conditions and have not worsened after initiation of treatment should not be
classified as SAEs. 
For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be 
classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49108](s) serio us criteria must be reported as SAE(s).
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Results in a congenital abnormality /birth defect

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51672] 2018
Is an important medical event. Note: Important medical events that may  not result in death, be 
life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10154], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Ex amples of such 
medical events include:
Bronchospasm associated with anaph ylaxis requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room 
or at home; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV), hepatitis A 
virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), or 
parvovirus B19 (B19V)
Unexpected Adverse Event
An unex pected adverse event is an AE whose nature, severity, specificit y, or outcome is not 
consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the Reference Safet y Information 
(RSI ). “Unexpected” also refers to th eAEs that are mentioned in the IB a s occurring with a class 
of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product, but are not 
specificall y mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation. 
The expectedness o
fAEs will be determined by  [CONTACT_49135] . This 
determination will include considerations such as the number of AEs previously  observed, but 
not on the basis of what might be anticipated form the pharmacological properties of a product.
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adve rse Reaction 
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is defined as any  suspected 
adverse reaction to study  treatment (ie, including active comparators) that is both serious and 
unexpected. 
The event(s) must meet all of the following:
Suspected adverse reaction
Serious
Unexpected
Assessed as related to study  treatment
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51673] (UADE) is any  serious adverse effect on health or safet y 
or an y life -threatening problem or de ath caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously  identified in nature, severit y, or degree of incidence in the 
study  protocol or product labeling; or any  other unanticipated serious problem associated with a
device that relates to the rights, safet y, or welfare of subjects.
Symptoms of the Disease under Study
Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classed a sAEs as long as they  are within the 
normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected disease progre ssion and are part of the efficacy  or 
effectiveness data collected in the study . Significant worsening of s ymptoms should be recorded 
as an AE.
Preexisting conditions prior to randomization are described in the medical history , and those that 
manifest with the same severit y, frequency , or duration after drug exposure, are  not be recorded 
asAEs. However, when there is an increase in the severit y, duration or frequency of a 
preexisting condition, the event must be described on the AE CRF.
Clinical Laborator y and Other Safety Assessment
A change in the value of a clinical laboratory  parameter, vital sign measure, or ECG assessment 
can represent an AE if the change is clinicall y relevant or if, during administration of 
investigational product, a shift of a par ameter is observed from a value in the normative range to 
a value that is outside the normal range and considered clinically  significant, or a further waning 
of an alread y clinically significant value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation 
from the reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while continuing 
administration or after the end of administration with the investigational product, and the range 
of variation of the respective parameter within its reference range, should also be considered.
If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal clinical laboratory  (such as hematology  
panel or clinical chemistry panel), vital sign, or ECG values which were not present at the 
pretreatment evaluation obse rved closest to the start of study  treatment, further investigations 
should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible 
explanation (eg, concomitant disease or expected disease evolution) is found for the abnorma l 
values.
The investigator should assess, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of the 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory  value, vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinicall y 
significant and represents an AE.
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51674] 2018
Collection of ECG parameters is suggested to be performed in triplicates and conducted b y a 
central labo ratory  for all study  subjects.
Appendix 2.2  Collection of Adverse Events
AllAEs/SAEs are collected from the time the informed consent document is signed until the 
defined follow -up period stated in Section
 8.1.3. This includes events occurring during the 
screening phase of the study , regardless of whether or not investigational product is 
administered. 
AllAEs/SAEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline 
status or all variables hav e returned to baseline), regardless of whether the subject is still 
participating in the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved 
(the investigator does not expect any  further improvement or worsening of the event), or th e 
event is otherwise explained.
Appendix 2.[ADDRESS_51675] dose a 
new AE of severe d yspepsia (with the appropriate date of onset) should be documented in the 
source.
The medical assessment of severit y is determined by  [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:
Mild: A ty pe of AE that is usually  transient and may  require only  minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally  interfere with usual activities of 
daily  living.
Moderate: A t ype o f AE that is usually  alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. 
The event interferes with usual activities of dail y living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject.
Severe: A t ype of AE that int errupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly  affects 
clinical status, or may  require intensive therapeutic intervention.
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51676] 2018
Relationship Categorization
A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for 
each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been caused b y the investigational product. If 
there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the A E should be classified as “not 
related”. Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting 
a possible cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence 
of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”. The causality  assessment must be 
documented in the source.
The following additional guidance may  be helpful:
Table A1  Adverse Event Relationship Categorization
Related The temporal relationship between the event and the adm inistration of the 
investigational product is compelling enough and/or follows a known or suspected 
response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s 
medical condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident.
Not related The event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s underlying 
medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or 
biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event.
Outcome Cate gorization
The outcome of AEs must be documented in the source during the course of the study . Outcomes 
are as follows:
Fatal
Not Recovered/Not Resolved
Recovered/Resolved
Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae
Recovering/Resolving
Unknown
If applicable, action taken (ie, dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug interrupted, 
drug withdrawn, not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE CRF. Safet y 
Reporting
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51677] be reported b y the investigator to the Shire Global 
Drug Safet y Department and the CRO/Shire medical monitor within 24 hours of becoming aware 
of the event. Note: The 24- hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply  to reports of 
abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (see Appendix 2.8) unless they result in an SAE.
The investigator must complete, sign, and date the Shire 
“Clinical Study  Adverse Event Form for 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non -seriou sAEs as Required b y Protocol ”, verify  the 
accuracy  of the information recorde d on the form with the corresponding source documents 
(Note: Source documents are not to be sent unless requested)
,and fax or e -mail the form to the 
Shire Global Drug Safety Department. A cop y of the Shire Clinical Study  Adverse Event Form 
for Serious Adv erse Events (SAEs) and Non- seriou sAEs as Required b y Protocol (and an y 
applicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monitor using the 
details specified in the emergency  contact [CONTACT_1739].
Medical Device Safety Reporting
All serious injuries and UADEs must be reported to the sponsor as an SAE in the same process 
as described above. Serious injury  (SI) is defined as:
Ledto death;
Led to a serious deterioration in health of a patient, user, or others that
Results in a life -threatening illness or injury
Results in a permanent impairment/ damage of a body  function or body  structure
Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment/ damage to 
body  function/ structure.
Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality /birth defect

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51678] 2018
Appendix 2.4  Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to investigational product) are collected from the time the 
subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_51679] be reported to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department and the CRO/Shire medical 
monitor within [ADDRESS_51680] awareness of the event.
In addition, an
y SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered b y the 
investigator at an y interval after the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Global 
Drug Safet y Department within [ADDRESS_51681]’s death (eg, the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of 
death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of dea th recorded as the resolution 
date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s 
death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded.
For an y SAE that results in the subject ’s death or any  ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another investigational product action was previously  taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, 
withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not 
changed” o
r “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The 
investigational product action of withdrawn should not be selected solel y as a result of the 
subject’s death.
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51682] be reported within 24 hours to the Shire Global Drug Safety  Department using 
the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form.
A cop y of the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form (and any  
applicable follow -
up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monitor using the 
details specified in the emergency  contact [CONTACT_1739]. The pregnant 
fema le study  participant must be withdrawn from the study .
Every  effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy  outcome and 
condition of the infant. It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain this information within 
[ADDRESS_51683] -partum.
Pregnancy  complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage, elective abortion or 
congenital abnormality  are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clin ical Study  
Serious Adverse Event and Non- serious AEs Required by  [CONTACT_10191]. 
In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy  meets serious criteria, 
it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event and 
Non-serious AEs Required by  [CONTACT_49136]. The test date of the first positive serum/urine -hCG 
test or ultrasound result will determine the pregnancy  onset date.
Appendix 2.8  Abuse, Misuse, Overdose and Medication Error
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the sponsor 
according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they  result in an AE/SAE as describe d 
inAppendix 2.1.
Note: The [ADDRESS_51684] 2018
The c ategories below are not mutually  exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category .
Abuse – Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used for a 
non-medical purpose (eg, to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that 
may be detrimental to the individual and/or society
Misuse 
–Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at 
any dose (Note: this includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as 
directe d at the dose prescribed by  [CONTACT_760])
Overdose – Intentional or unintentional intake of a dose of investigational product higher 
than the protocol -prescribed dose
Medication Error – An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use o f 
an investigational product. For studies, medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only  
as defined below.
Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigational product are not considered reportable as 
medication errors.
Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation.
The administration and/or use of the unassigned treatment is/are alway s reportable as a 
medication error.
The administration and/or use of an expi[INVESTIGATOR_49109] a s a 
reportable medication error.
All investigational product provided to pediatric subjects should be supervised by  [CONTACT_31588]/legall y authorized representative/caregiver.
Appendix 2.[ADDRESS_51685] subjects participating in a clinical trial from immediate harm, these do not 
constitute de facto deviation from the protocol. Urgent safet y measures may be taken b y the 
sponsor or clinical investigator, and may  include any  of the following:
Immediate change in study  design or stud y procedures
Temporary  or permanent halt of a given clinical trial or trials
Any other immediate action taken in order to protect clinical trial participants from 
immediate hazard to their health and safet y
For non-commercial use only

does not require prior authorization f rom the sponsor. In the event(s) of an apparent direct hazard 
to the subject, the investigator will notify  the sponsor immediately  by [CONTACT_49137], and within 1 calendar day after the 
change i s implemented. The sponsor will also ensure the responsible EC(s) and relevant 
competent authorit y(s) are notified of the urgent safet y measures taken in such cases according to 
local regulations.

APPENDIX 3  GENETICS
Shire intends to apply  genetic research across the SHP655 development program to differentiate 
participants with congenital (genetic) versus acquired TTP. Collection of appropriate samples 
from populations with well described clinical characteristics may  lead to improvements in the 
design and interpretation of c linical studies, genetically  guided treatment strategies, and a better 
understanding of disease etiology , which may  lead to new therapeutic approaches.
Candidate genes which may  be studied include those potentially  related to the mechanism of 
action of 
SHP655as well as those potentially  responsible for absorption, disposition, 
metabolism, and excretion of SHP655 . Future research may  suggest other genes, gene categories, 
proteins, etc., as candidates for influencing not only  response to SHP655 , but also sus ceptibility  
to TTP for which SHP655 may be evaluated. Thus, this additional genomic research may  involve 
the future stud y of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but onl y as they relate to TTP
disease susceptibility  and drug action.
A DNA sample will be drawn at screening. Samples will be collected from all subjects in order 
to meet inclusion criteria.
Samples will be labeled with the study  protocol number, the subject’s study  identification 
number, and information related to the sample .No personal identifiers will be recorded on the 
sample labels.
Subjects terminating early  from the study  due to AE, tolerability , or drug -related issues should, 
where possible, be approached for their remaining protocol-defined samples at the earliest 
possible time. Unscheduled samples should be labeled with free text capturing stud y protocol 
number, subject’s stud y identification number, and information related to the sample (RNA or 
protein, sampling date, and time). Samples will be shipped to and stored at bioreposi tories as 
detailed in the laboratory manual. DNA, RNA, and protein will be extracted from the samples 
only when, and if, an y separate exploratory  research will be undertaken. 
As an added level of security , the sample will be recoded with a new, unique num ber at the 
biorepository  laboratory . This unique number is the only  code used in any  subsequent anal ysis 
and will be used to link a sample to a subject and to ensure that the subject’s identity  remains 
confidential. 
A link file linking the first and secon d codes will be kept in a secure place at the sponsor, 
with restricted access. This will be in a secure environment outside of the clinical study  
database and separate to any  anal ysis results. This file will be used to identify  the relevant 
samples for ana lysis, facilitate correlation of any  results with clinical data, allow regulatory  
audit, and trace samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent. 
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_51689] of participation in this pharmacogenomics portion of the protocol, or an y results 
derived from it, should be recorded in the subjects’ personal medical records. A record of 
participation in the pharmacogenomics portion of the protocol will, however, be captured in the 
study -specific source documentation records or CRF.
The sponsor, sponso r’s representatives, biorepositories, and an y specialt y laboratories will be 
blinded to the subject’s identity . The sample and/or extracted material will otherwise be stored 
for up to [ADDRESS_51690] their 
sample and/or extracted material destro yed. The link will also be destroy ed at the same time as 
any remaining sample(s) are destroy ed. Any results alread y generated from the samples will not 
be removed from an y analy ses that have alread y been performed. 
Participation in this portion of the study  is optional and does not impact the subject’s eligibility  
for participation in the main clinical study . Subjects may  continue to participate in the primary  
study  if they  refuse to provide a blood sample or if they  withdraw their samples. 
Results of the genetic analy ses may  contribute to the global understanding of TTP and its 
treatment and may  be used intern ally to help support the design of additional clinical studies, 
form part of scientific publication, or be made known to the regulatory  authorities as part of a 
new drug application. Any  results generated will be for exploratory research purposes only  and 
will not be made available unless required b y law (ie, to regulatory authorities). Additionally, as 
any potential anal ysis does not form part of predefined anal ysis within the clinical study  
protocol, an y results will be reported separatel y to the main cli nical study  report. Subjects may  
request the results of an y anal ysis on their samples, although it will not be possible to interpret 
these.

•Intrauterine device (IUD)
•Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)
Bilateral tubal occlusion
Vasectomy
A vasectomy in a male subject or a vasectomized partner for a female subject is a highly effective contraception 
method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner of the women of childbearing potential 
(WOCBP) and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of 
contraception should be used.
Sexual abstinence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective metho d only  if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and us ual lifestyle of 
the participant.
NOTES: 
a) Typi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating i n clinical

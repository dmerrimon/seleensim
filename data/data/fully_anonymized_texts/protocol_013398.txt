Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 8 of 64  1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATION ALE 
 
1.1 Background  
 
Patients with advanced hematologic malignancies are incurable with conventional chemotherapy 
and often  require allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).  The principal goals of HCT 
are to allow engraftment and development of a donor -derived immu ne system that can effectively 
produce an immunologic attack against the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] ’s tumor cells  resulting in a  graft -versus -
leukemia  effect .  Early pi[INVESTIGATOR_205058] -stimulating factor (G -
CSF) based mobilization is a relat ively safe and effective alternative to bone marrow harvesting for 
collection of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) prior to allografting1-4.  Multiple randomized trials 
have since demonstrated an advantage of G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC)  
compared to bone marrow (BM) for HCT .  PBSCs are associated with m ore rapid hematopoietic 
engraft ment, similar rates of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), and higher rates of chronic 
GVHD5-10. Based on these findings, use of PBSC in HCT is now standard practice at many 
transplant centers.    
 
CD34+ stem cell content in mobilized peripheral blood product is considered the most important 
parameter of graft quality, and is recognized as a predictor of hematopoietic engraft ment after stem 
cell transplantation.  Infusion of more than 2.0 x 106 cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16148] (BW) CD34+ 
cells is associated with rapid and durable engraftment of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]12-15.  Although the  optimal 
CD34+ cell dose is  unknown, a target of  5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205059] a 
minimum  a threshold of 2 x 106 CD34+cells/ kg is used at many transplant centers11. The focus of 
current research in stem cell mobilization and collection is to optimize the number of stem cells 
collected by [CONTACT_205160]16.   
 
Previous studies have demonstrated a highly significant correlati on between the CD34+ 
concentration in peripheral blood and the potential to collect an adequate amount of CD34+ cells 
within one or up to three leukapheresis procedures17-18. Many groups have suggested that a peak 
level of 20/ μL CD34+ cells should be considered as the threshold19.  The quality of the apheresis 
product such as the number of CD34+ cells in the graft and the presence of immune competent 
cells may also impact post -transplantation outcomes.  Ultimately, the efficiency of st em cell 
mobilization is determined by [CONTACT_205161]20-21.   
 
1.1.[ADDRESS_244707] frequently used single agent f or stem cell mobilization in the allogeneic 
setting.  G -CSF mobilizes stem cells from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood 
primarily by [CONTACT_100276] -regulation of CXCL12 production by [CONTACT_205162].   While it is 
relatively safe, G -CSF requires 4 -5 days of administration prior to collection  which may 
be inc onvenient for donors and cause absence from work during the mobilization process.  
In a retrospective study performed using data from the International Bone Marrow 
Transplant Registry (IBMTR) and European Bone Marrow Transplant ( EBMT ) Group , 
60% of donors required more than one leukapheresis procedure to collect the target number 
of CD34+ cells, and 15% required three or more9.  Surprisingly, approximately 20% of 
donors required placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) and the overall ra te of 
serious complications associated with G -CSF mobilized peripheral blood donation was 
1.1%, higher in comparison to the 0.5% rate observed following bone marrow donation.   
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: [ADDRESS_244708] prompted the evaluation 
of novel agents for stem cell mobilization with the capacity to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_205060] a better tolerated drug administration and cell collection regimen.   
 
Plerixafor (AMD3100), an inhib itor of CXCR4, has demonstrated the ability to  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_205061]24-27.  Interestingly, 
compared to G-CSF mobilized cells, a higher proportion of plerixafor -mobilized CD34+ 
cells were in G [ADDRESS_244709] a higher fre quency of repopulating activity, 
suggesting an intrinsic difference in the engrafting  capacity of the mobilized CD34+ cells28-
29.  Additionally, there is evidence that plerixafor -mobilized grafts have different 
characteristics compared to grafts obtained with G -CSF11.  A phase II study of 25 patients 
receiving PBSC from HLA -identical sibling  donors mobilized with a single dose of 
plerixafor observed  a higher content of T -CD3+ and T -CD4+ cells in plerixafor -mobilized 
grafts compared to historical controls  mobilized with G -CSF30. Immune reconstitution was 
prompt despi[INVESTIGATOR_205062]34+ c ells and engraftment kinetics and rates of GVHD 
were not significantly different to historical controls.  The differences in graft composition 
between various mobilizing agents may ultimately influence engraftment, immune 
recovery, anti -tumor activity, and  patient outcomes.  
 
1.1.2 Critical Role of CXCR4 and CXCL12 Interaction  in Stem Cell Mobilization  
 
The interaction between CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR4) and its ligand, stromal derived 
factor -1 (CXCL12 ), plays a crucial role in hematopoietic cell chemotaxis and a dhesion to 
the BM stromal cells31-34.  CXCR4 is a member of a large family of seven transmembrane 
domain receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G 1 proteins  that is expressed on CD34+ cells .  
Binding with its only known ligand CXCL12  (also know n as SDF1 ), expressed on the 
surface of bone marrow stromal cells,  results in activation of multiple signal transduction 
pathways ultimately triggering chemotaxis22.  Experiments with neutralizing antibodies 
directed against CXCR4 or CXCL12  showed that unc oupling the CXCL12 /CXCR4 
signaling is a crucial step in G -CSF-mediated HSC mobilization33.  Targeted disruption of 
either molecule is lethal in mice, resulting in failure of HSC migration from liver to bone 
marrow, defects in B -lymphopo iesis, and cerebella r dysgenesis35-37.  Efficient mobilization 
of murine stem and progenitor cells is observed following injection of adenovirus 
expressing CXCL12  or after injection of methionine -CXCL12 , both resulting in a gradient 
of CXCL12  from BM to PB38.  Treatment of mi ce and primates with sulfated 
polysaccharides (e.g. fucoidan) results in a rapid increase in circulating CXCL12  and 
subsequent stem cell mobilization39.  These preclinical studies confirm the importance of 
CXCR4 and CXCL12  interaction in stem cell mobiliza tion and targeted disruption of 
CXCL12/CXCR4 interactions is an effective strategy for mobilization of HSCs40.

1.2 Study Agent: BL -8040  
 
1.2.1 Mechanism of Action  
 
BL-8040  (developed by [CONTACT_205163]., formerly developed by [CONTACT_205164]140 ) is a novel selective inhibitor of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor .  BL -
8040 is a 14 -residue, cyclic, synthetic peptide capped with an aromatic ring.  It binds and 
inhibits the CXCR4 chemokine receptor with high affinity (IC 50 4.42 nM) and has been 
shown  to be a specific antagonist of CXCR4 both in vitro  and in vivo  studies and to have a 
slow dissociation rate from the receptor.  
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_244710] dose (0.9mg/kg; equivalent to 0.73 mg/kg free base peptide on dry basis) in  
the clinical study BKTSC001, were found to be 820 ng/ml and 791 ng*h/mL, respectively. 
The mean human C max and AUC following  administration of the highest dose (1.0 mg/kg 
free base peptide on dry basis) in the clinical study BL -8040.02, were found to be 1090 
ng/ml and 1740 ng*h/mL, respectively.  These findings were used to compare plasma drug 
exposures between animal studies and human experience.  
 
Studies have been conducted both in rats and dogs evaluating the single dose toxicity and 
repeated dose toxic ity of BL -8040.  Acute toxicity was considered to be low in both rats 
and dogs following single dose administration.  Toxicokinetic evaluation of BL -8040 
single dose administration was examined following dose levels in dogs and a maximum 
tolerated dose (MT D) could not be defined despi[INVESTIGATOR_205063] 18 mg/kg were > 20 times and > [ADDRESS_244711] dose (0.9 mg/kg ; equivalent to 0.73 mg/kg 
free base pep tide on dry basis ) in the clinical study BKTSC001.  Repeated dose toxicity 
studies in rats and dogs showed no histopathological organ changes and no target organ 
toxicity could be identified at exposures (AUC) several times (12.5 -fold in dogs and 13.5 -
fold in rats) higher than the exposure in humans following a single dose of 0.9 mg/kg  (0.73 
mg/kg free base peptide on dry basis) in study BKTSC001 and higher (6.3-fold in dogs and 
6.7-fold in rats)  following administration of 1 mg/kg (free base peptide on dry  basis) in 
clinical study BL -8040.[ADDRESS_244712] dose ( 1 mg/kg) in clinical study B L-8040.02 , a dose 
reported to be well tolerated.  
 
Side effects of BL -8040 in the general toxicology studies in rats and dogs included 
anaphylactoid -type rea ctions, such as transient erythema and peripheral edema.  Both in-
vitro  and in-vivo studies indicate that BL -8040 partially activates mobilized immune cells.  
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 11 of 64  In response to BL -8040, known markers of immune cell activation on granulocytes were 
altered incl uding an increase of cell surface expression of C11b, reduction of cell surface 
expression of CD62L, as well as secretion of MMP9 (a factor involved in increased motility 
of granulocytes).  BL -[ADDRESS_244713] on the release of pro -inflammatory 
mediators.  
 
1.2.3 Pre-clinical Studies of Efficacy  
 
Cell line studi es demonstrated BL -8040 has high affinity for CXCR4.  One study evaluated 
BL-8040 in a homologous displacement competitive binding assay with radio -labeled 125I-
CXCL12 to CHO cells overexp ressing CXCR441.  The IC 50 of BL -8040 binding to CHO -
CXCR4 cells was  2.5 nM.  An additional study further proved that BL -8040 inhibited 
CXCL12 -mediated migration of human Jurkat cells and mouse splenocytes in a dose -
dependent manner in vitro (IC 50 = 0.6 5 and 0.54 nM, respectively)42.  The antagonist 
property of BL -8040 on CXCR4 was also functionally tested in vitro , using migration 
properties of cells overexpressing CXCR4, towards the CXCL12 chemokine gradient.  The 
IC50 in these experiments was found to be of the same order of magnitude as in the 
competitive displacement m ethod (0.54 -4.42 nM).  
 
The efficacy of BL -[ADDRESS_244714] 
was seen in mice at a dose range of 2.5 – 15 mg/kg, equivalent to 0.2 – 1.25 mg/kg, 
respectively, in humans.  Stem cells mobilized by [CONTACT_180721] -8040 maintained 90% of transplanted 
mice for longer than 6 months and were capable of producing long -term rescue in lethally 
irradiated secondary transplanted mice, indicating that BL -8040 treatm ent yielded viable 
and healthy stem cells.  
 
1.2.4 Clinical Trial Experience with BL -8040  
 
To date, two clinical stud ies (BKTSC001  and BL -8040.02 ) have been conducted with BL -
[ADDRESS_244715] been completed.  BKTSC001  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  was a non -randomized, open -label, single administration, dose escalation 
study, where BL -8040 was administered to  multiple myeloma (MM)  patients undergoing 
treatment wi th chemo -mobilization and G -CSF.  Eligible subjects received a [ADDRESS_244716] MM mobilization 
treatment protocol consisting of cyclophosphamide (3 -4 g/m2), antiemetic drugs (e.g. 
Zofran) and 2 -mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium (MESNA, prophylactic treatment for 
hemorrhagic cystitis) on Day 0.  On Day 5 until the end of stem cell collection, granulocyte 
colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) was self -administered subcutaneously (in the evenings) 
at 5 µg/kg  per day.  On Day 10, subjects received one SC injection of BL -8040 in the 
morning and G -CSF 12 hours later in the afternoon.  Stem cell collection (apheresis) was 
performed at a WBC count over 1,[ADDRESS_244717] risk with a specific dose.  No clinically consistent o r cumulative 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 12 of 64  abnormalities were observed for the safety parameters evaluated, including AE incidence, 
laboratory safety values, vital signs, ECG parameters or physical examinations, as well as 
Karnofsky status.  Single dose administration of BL -8040 caused  rapid mobilization of 
WBC and CD34+ stem cells in a dose -dependent manner.  Fewer apheresis  were required 
as BL -[ADDRESS_244718] dosage group of 0.9 mg/kg , all subjects had 
only one apheresis, with a mean of 20.9 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg collected (range: 11.5 – 26.1 
million cells/kg).  
 
BL-8040.02 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was a Phase I, two -part study exploring the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacodynamic  and pharmacokinetic effect of ascending doses of BL -8040 
in healthy subjects designed to support development of BL -8040 as a single agent treatment 
for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization for autologous and/or allogeneic transplantation.  
 
Part 1 (Dose E scalation) was a randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled study 
exploring the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic (PD) and  pharmacokinetic (PK) 
profile of BL -8040. CD34+ cell mobilization was measured in healthy subjects following 
administration of u p to two doses of BL -8040 (QD on 2 consecutive days). Each cohort in 
Part 1 consisted of 8 subjects; 6 subjects in each cohort were randomly allocated to receive 
BL-8040 (doses 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mg/kg) and [ADDRESS_244719] received BL -8040 at the 
selected optimal dose level of 1.0 mg/kg. A total of [ADDRESS_244720] risk with a specific dose. Administration of BL -8040 
caused rapid mobilization of WBC and CD34+ stem cells in a dose -dependent manner.  In 
Part [ADDRESS_244721] dose tested of 1mg/kg, the mean WBC coun t rapi[INVESTIGATOR_205064] 4 -8 hrs; from baseline levels of 5.8 (±0.97) x 109/L to 
31.4 (± 4. 3) x 109/L at 4  hrs, to 33. 4 (± 6. 5) x 109/L at [ADDRESS_244722] injection, 24.8 (± 5.7). In Part 2 of the study a ll 8 subjects received a 
single dose of 1  mg/kg and approximately  3.[ADDRESS_244723] volume (18L 
target volume) apheresis.  At 3.5 hours after a single dose of BL -8040, the WBC count rose 
to a median of 32 x 103/µL (range; 29 – 39 x 103) and the CD34+ cell count to 43/µL 
(range; 27 -84/µL).  The number of CD34+ reached its peak after [ADDRESS_244724] collection of 
CD34+ cells in a single apheresis session. The median  CD34+ collected was 11.89 x106/kg 
(range; 5.09 - 15.23 x 106/Kg). These results suggest a potential second collection of 
CD34+ cells after 24hrs if needed without the need for second injection of BL -8040.  
 
In addition to the studies in stem cell mobilization, BioLineRx is currently investigating 
the safety and efficacy of multiple (7 consecutive administration days) escalating doses of 
BL-8040 in combination with Ara -C (Cytarabine) in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a Phase IIa, open -label, multicenter clinical study, BL -
8040.01 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).   
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_244725] comm on AEs seen in all studies conducted with BL -8040 to date are 
injection site reactions (including pain, erythema, pruritus and inflammation) and systemic 
reactions: hives, pruritus (not at the injection site), flushing, chills, rash and urticaria. Other 
isolated AEs reported among others were paresthesia, musculoskeletal pain, headache, 
constipation, tingling and elevation of liver function test s. 
 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: [ADDRESS_244726] risk with a specific dose. No clinically consistent or cumulative abnormalities were 
observed for the safety parameters evaluated, including AE incidence, laboratory safety 
values, vital signs or ECG parameters, among other.  
 
All related TEAEs (13/131) wer e in the higher dose groups (0.3 and 0.9 mg/kg). 
Approximately half of them were under the SOC "General Disorder and Administration 
Site Condition". Ten out of 132 events were considered mild in intensity and 23.1% 
moderate in intensity (3/133). The Invest igator did not consider any of the severe events as 
related to the study drug.  
 
There were six SAEs reported throughout the study, affecting 4/18 subjects (22.2%); one 
subject in the 0.006 mg/kg dose group, two subjects in the 0.1 mg/kg dose group and one  
subject in the 0.3 mg/kg group. Two concurrent SAEs in a single 0.3 mg/kg subject (chest 
pain and dyspnea) were considered by [CONTACT_205165]. These 
events were assessed as unrelated by [CONTACT_456]'s Medical Safety Officer s ince:  (i) they 
recurred upon later treatment with G -CSF only, (ii) the events were similar to those 
anticipated with administration of G -CSF, and (iii) AEs were reported [ADDRESS_244727] injection, 
long after the drug was eliminated according to the PK profile  (BL-8040 t1/2 is 0.5 hr, see 
Table 5 -1). An additional SAE of hypokalemia occurred following BL -8040 administration 
and was determined to be unrelated by [CONTACT_737]. Upon review of the CRF, the 
Sponsor’s Medical Safety Officer assessed the hypokalem ia as severe in intensity and 
possibly related to the BL -8040. Three other SAEs (two cases of neutropenic fever and one 
case of sepsis) occurred prior to study drug administration and were anticipated side effects 
of chemotherapeutic agents applied in cond itioning for cell therapy and therefore 
determined unrelated to BL -8040.  
 
There were very few laboratory abnormalities determined to have been clinically 
significant, and fewer still post -dosing or associated with an AE. Only one laboratory result 
(hypokal emia) was considered to be possibly related to BL -8040 by [CONTACT_1034]'s Medical 
Safety officer. Blood glucose and LDH tended to slightly increase post -administration, but 
were not associated with notable negative effects. Physical examination and vital sig n 
parameters were normal or stable in nearly all subjects following BL -[ADDRESS_244728] been completed, in which BL -8040 doses of 0.5 - 1.5 
mg/kg were investigated.  A total of 22 subjects were exposed to d oses escalating according 
to the protocol’s escalation scheme. Only one grade 3 related serious adverse event (SAEs) 
of Sweet syndrome was reported and assessed as possibly related to BL -8040. The event 
was reported at the dose level 1.5 mg/kg. It is known  that Sweet syndrome occurs in 
patients with AML, and this particular patient subsequently showed progressive disease. 
According to the protocol three more patients were recruited for a total of 6 patients.  An 
independent Data Monitoring Committee reviewe d the safety data of all cohorts and 
considered BL -8040 safe and well tolerated at doses up to 1.5 mg/kg. The DMC approved 
the initiation of the dose expansion part of the study using this dose level.  
 
The 22 subjects dosed to date, reported 348 adverse events (AEs), among which 70% (242 
events) of the AEs were assessed as unlikely or unrelated to the study drug. Within the 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 14 of 64  events assessed as possible, probably or definitely related to BL -8040 (30%), 36%  (38) 
were grade 1, 53% (56) were grade 2, 9% (10) were grade 3 (1 thrombocytopenia, 1 
headache, and SAE of Sweet Syndrome, 5 injection site reactions and 2 systemic reactions) 
and 1% (1) were grade 4 (a case of neutropenia). Injection site reactions and s ystemic 
reactions were found to be the most common adverse events reported. During this study in 
order to mitigate the systemic reactions, pre -treatment with intravenous steroids and anti -
histamines was implemented in some patients according to the investi gator’s judgment. In 
addition, a new method of reconstitution was developed to enable dilution of BL -8040; and 
rotation of the site of injection at each dosing was recommended with intent to minimize 
injection site reactions.  
 
Thirteen out of 22 subjects r eported 22 serious adverse events (SAEs), only one was 
assessed as possible related and was already described above.  To date, the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached when treating AML patients with seven consecutive 
days of 1.5 mg/kg BL -8040.  
 
BL-8040.02  
 
No Serious Adverse Events were reported in all dose levels. All the AEs but three were 
mild or moderate , severe AEs included: transient syncope (resolved in one min), two events 
of asthenia (resolved within 15 - 30 min). Most common BL -8040 rela ted AEs included 
injections site (IS) reactions characterized by [CONTACT_77368], edema and erythema; transient and mild 
systemic reactions (rash, chills, pruritus, urticaria, hot flashes/flushing,    
hives, hypotension, chest pain, nausea). All resolved spontaneousl y within 30 - 120 
minutes. Additional less frequent AE’s included asthenia, peripheral swelling, paresthesia, 
hyperhidrosis, tachycardia, edema peripheral, dizziness, headache and pallor. Pre -
medication with steroids  and anti-histamin es was effective in re ducing the frequency and 
magnitude of the systemic reactions.  
 
1.2.6 Rationale for Dosing and Regimen  
 
The dose of 1 mg/kg SC injection was chosen based on the safety and efficacy data from 
the BKTSC001 , BL-8040.02, and the ongoing BL -8040.[ADDRESS_244729] common AEs 
being injection site irritation, flushing, and itching , and systemic reactions that were 
successfully managed with premedication.  
 
In the 1 mg/kg dosage group  of the BL -8040.[ADDRESS_244730] a mean of 
11.89  x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.  In the 0.9 mg/kg dosage group of the BKTSC001 study, all 
[ADDRESS_244731] a mean of 20.9 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg after 
treatment with G -CSF in combination with a single BL -8040 administration.  
 
Overall, the 1mg/kg dose selected to be used in this study was found to be safe in all st udies 
to date and highly efficacious for SC mobilization and collection in the healthy volunteer 
study.  
 
1.3 Study Rationale   
 
Current protocols use G -CSF to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells from matched sibling and 
volunteer unrelated donors.  Unfortun ately, this process requires four to six days of G -CSF injection 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: [ADDRESS_244732] notably bone pain  and rarely splenic rupture9.  BL -
8040 is associated with few side effects , is given as a single SC injection,  and collection of  cells 
occurs on the same day as BL -8040 administration.  This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of this novel agent for hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization and allogeneic transplantation 
based on the following hypotheses:  
 
1. Healthy HLA -matched donors receiving one injection  of BL -8040 will mobilize sufficient 
CD34+ cells (at least 2.0  x 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593]) following  no more than two  
leukapheresis  collections  to support a hematopoietic cell transplant.  
 
2. The hematopoietic cells mobilized by [CONTACT_205166]-8040 will be functional and will result in prompt 
and durable hematopoietic engraftment following transplantation into HLA -identical siblings 
with advanced hematologic al malignancies using various non -myeloablative and 
myeloablative  conditioning regimens and regimens for routine GVHD prophylaxis.  
 
3. If these hypotheses 1 and 2 are confirmed after an interim safety analysis of the data, then the 
study will continue and inc lude recruitment of haploidentical donors .   
 
1.4 Correlative Studies  Rationale  and Summary  
 
The ability of BL -8040 to mobilize normal hematopoietic progenitor cells will be examined via 
peripheral blood samples collected prior to the administration of BL -8040  (pre-treatment baseline 
assessment) , at 0.[ADDRESS_244733] BL -8040 administration , at 3 hours  (immediately before 
apheresis) post BL -[ADDRESS_244734] BL -8040 administration  (Section  8.2).  Peripheral blood samples w ill be analyzed by [CONTACT_205167]34+ cells and lymphocytes that are mobilized over time on 
Day 1.  
 
Because the composition of CD34+ cell subsets , mesenchymal stem cells, NK cells,  and T cell 
subsets ma y influence recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205065], anti -tumor activity, graft versus 
host disease, morbidity, and mortality, these subsets will be analyzed from samples taken prior to 
administration of BL -8040  (pre-treatment baseline assessment), at 3 hours (before the beginning of 
the apheresis) , immediately post-completion of apheresis , from the mobilized product , and [ADDRESS_244735] BL -8040 administration  (Section 8.3.1).  
 
If a second leukapheresis is required, peripheral blood samples for CBC and en umeration of CD34+ 
cells will also be collected immediately prior to the second leukapheresis (approximately 24 hours 
after BL -8040 injection) and immediately post-completion of apheresis  (Section 8.2).   
 
The results of these studies will be used to design further therapeutic trials.

5.4 Mobilization of Allogeneic Stem Cell Donor  
 
Donors will be mobilized as outpatients with subcutaneous (SC) BL -8040 in the morning (Day 1) 
followed by [CONTACT_205172] 180 minutes ( up to 270 min utes) after the injection per 
institutional protocol.  If the donor does not reach the collection goal for mobilization (≥ 5.0 x 106 
CD34+ cells/kg), a second leukapheresis will be performed on Day 2 ( 24 hours ± 2 hours from the 
BL-8040 injection) in an effort  to reach a total of ≥ 5 x 106 cells/kg and at least   2 x 106 cells/kg 
from the combined collections. Donors who cannot mobilize ≥  2 x 106 cells/kg after two apheresis 
section will be considered mobilization failures (See Section 5. 4.4 for information reg arding 
mobilization failure) . 
 
5.4.1 BL-8040  Administration  
 
In part 1, BL-8040 will be administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg SC injection on Day 1.   
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 22 of 64  In part 2, BL -8040 will be administered at a dose of 1. 25 mg/kg SC injection on Day 1.  
 
The following procedures wi ll be performed after injection of BL -8040 on Day 1 :   
• Temperature , blood pressure, pulse, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_205078] 1, 2, 3-4, 
6, and 8 hours ± 15 min following the end of the BL -8040 injection.   
• Approximately 3 hours  following injection of BL -8040  (between 180 minutes and 
270 minutes is acceptable), begin leukapheresis  procedure to process a minimum 
of three blood volumes accor ding to institutional guidelines  
• At various times pre- and post-injection ( see Section s 8.1-8.3), obtain venous 
samples for PK, CBC , and cytometric flow analysis (enumeration of CD34+ cells 
and lymphocytes, Section  8.2) and CD34+ subset analysis and T -cell phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
(Section  8.3).  At the completion of leukapheresis, a sample from the leukapheresis 
product (no more than 10% of product) will be obtained for CBC and flow 
cytometric analysis (CD34+ subset and T cell phenotype analysis, Section 8.3.2 ).  
Cryo preservation of leukapheresis product will be performed according to 
institutional guidelines . 
 
If a Day 2 leukapheresis  is needed, the following procedures will be performed:  
• Temperature , blood pressure, pulse, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_205079].   
• Cryopreservation of leukapheresis  product will be performed according to 
institutional guidelines .  
• Venous samples for CBC and enumeration of CD34+ cells will be collected at 
specific time points ( Section  8.2).   
 
5.4.2 Premedication before BL -8040 Injection  
 
Premedication or treatment for local and systemic reaction will be allowed as per 
Investigator discre tion. 
• Pre-treatment of subjects prior to BL -8040 injection is allowed with the following 
concomitant medications: promethazine, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, 
acetaminophen, and steroids.  
• Other drugs may also be given as premedication at the Investigator’s discretion.  
• Clinically appropriate measures in case of BL -8040 related local injection site 
reactions (e.g., corticosteroids, anti -histamines, local treatments, etc .) may be taken.  
• Additional medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_205080] -emergent conditions wi ll be 
allowed at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Manufacturer , 
in advance when possible.  
 
5.4.3 Leukapheresis  
 
Donors  will undergo no less than three blood volumes leukapheresis (LP)  starting 
approximately 180 minutes ( up to 270 minutes) after injection of BL -[ADDRESS_244746] flow cytometry for CD34+ cell content.  The goal for 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell collection will be  ≥5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205074]  a minimum of 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593] .   
 
If the first leukapheresis product contains ≥ 5 .0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg  actual recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205081] : 10/25/17, Amendment: [ADDRESS_244747] contains < 5 .0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205082], a 
second leukapheresis  will be performed  approximately 24 hours after the injection  of BL -
8040  (i.e. Day 2) . If the sum of the grafts collected after two days is ≥ 2.0 x 106 CD34+ 
cells/kg  actual recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593] , the mobilization with BL -[ADDRESS_244748] 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205083], mobilization will be considered 
unsuccessful.   These donors will proceed with G -CSF mobilization per standard institution 
guidelines and will be followed for safety purposes for a period of five years after receiving 
BL-8040  (Refer to Section 5.4.5) .   
 
For the transplant purposes, up to 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205084]. Any 
additional cells will be aliquotted and cryopreserved for future donor cellular infusions  to 
the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205085] g uidelines .  
 
5.4.4 Mobilization Failure with BL -8040 
 
Donors are required to undergo a minimum of three blood volumes  apheresis/day  for up to 
two days (i.e. two leukapheresis proce dures ) to be considered evaluable for the primary 
endpoint.  If the donor fails to  collect ≥ 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205086] a minimum of three blood volumes  apheresis/day, the donor 
will be removed from the protocol and the donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205087].  The 
donor will still be followed for safety purposes  according to the protocol  (Section  5.2.4 ).   
 
If the donor is able to undergo a minimum of three blood volumes apheresis/day, but  the 
sum of the two leukapheresis products is < 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg actual recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205088], treatment will be considered unsuccessful (mobilization failure) .  In this case, the 
donor will be removed from protocol and will be mobilized with G -CSF according to the 
standard institutional procedures.   The donor /recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205089] , but 
followed for safety purposes according to the protocol  (Section s 5.4.5 and 5.5.5 ).  If the 
patient is unable to obtain sufficient cells for transplant from the G -CSF mobilization, the 
BL-[ADDRESS_244749]-administration of BL -8040 .  AEs and concomitant 
medications will be obtained at the 30 day follow -up visit/phone call. New AEs reported 
during this period and those that are still open will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization . Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.03.  
Hypocalcemia documented during the leukapheresis procedure is a known transient side 
effect and will not require additional follow -up unless determined to be clinically indicated 
by [CONTACT_1963] .  The donor will have a CBC with differential count drawn at [ADDRESS_244750]-completion of BL -8040 administration .  If the donor’s  CBC  has 
clinically significant changes from baseline  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_205090] [ADDRESS_244751] CBCs drawn monthly 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: [ADDRESS_244752] udy coordinator annually 
for 5 years .  Long term donor follow up will be performed in accordance to the consensus 
statement from the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation an d limited 
to three items: survival, onset of malignancies and onset of autoimmune diseases. In the 
case of a positive reply, the level of evidence should be indicated, that is if the diagnosis 
was confirmed by [CONTACT_205173].43 See Section 7.1 for donor follo w-up schedule of events.

5.7 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Concomitant medications and supportive care measures will be given at the discretion of the 
treating physician whenever medica lly necessary.   
 
5.8 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential (women with regular menses, amenorrhea, irregular cycles, using 
a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, or who have had a tubal ligation) are 
required to have a negative pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_244757] dose of BL -8040 (donor) 
or prior to start of conditioning  (recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]).  
 
Non-childbearing potential is defined as (by [CONTACT_73534]):  
• ≥ 45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 2 years.  
• Amenorrheic for > 2 years wit hout a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and an FSH value in the 
postmenopausal range upon pretrial (screening) evaluation.  
• Post-hysterectomy, oophorectomy, or tubal ligation.  
 
Donors or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (female or male along with their female partners) are required  to use two forms 
of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during participation in the study and for 
2 weeks following the dose of BL -8040 (donor) or 2 weeks following the stem cell transplant 
(recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]).  
 
If a donor or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205106], BL -8040 administration to the donor and/or stem 
cell transplant to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205107].  In addition, a positive urine 
test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  If it is confirmed that the recipie nt or donor is 
not pregnant, the donor may resume dosing and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205108].  
 
If a female donor or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205109] a male donor or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_205110] 1 month after the dose of BL -8040 (donor) or the stem cell transplant

8.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
8.1 Pharma cokinetics and PK Monitoring  
 
Non-compartmental PK parameters for BL -8040 (see below) will be derived from the individual 
concentration obtained at each of the PK time -points. Additional PK parameters may be derived if 
considered necessary:  
• Cmax - maximum BL -8040 plasma concentration  
• Tmax - time to reach the maximum BL -8040 plasma concentration  
• AUC 0-t - Area under the BL -[ADDRESS_244758] dosing, 
calculated by [CONTACT_115011] -logarithmic down trapezoidal summation  
• AUC 0-∞ - Area under the BL -8040 plasma concentration -time curve extrapolated to 
infinity, calculated as: AUC 0-∞ = AUC 0-t + Clast/λz, where C last is the last m easurable 
concentration  
• λz - elimination rate constant, determined by [CONTACT_205174]-linear plasma concentration -time curve  
• t1/2 - terminal elimination half -life, defined as 0.693/λ z

10.0 SAFETY , PHARMACOVIGIL ANCE , AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
The entities providing oversight of safety and compliance with the protocol require reporting as outline 
below.  
 
The Washington University Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) requires that all events meeting 
the definition of unanticipated problem or serious noncompliance be reported as outlined in Section 10.2.  
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: [ADDRESS_244766] be reported.  
 
BioLine RX requires that all SAEs  be repo rted as outlined in Section 10.5.  
 
10.1 Definitions  
 
10.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An AE is defined in ICH E6 as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have a ca usal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, 
whether or not rel ated to the medicinal (investigational) product.”  
 
An abnormal result of diagnostic procedures including abnormal laboratory findings will 
be considered an AE if it fulfills one or more of the following:  
• Results in subject ’s withdrawal by [CONTACT_737]  
• Is associated with an SAE  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Is considered by [CONTACT_167324]  
A new condition or the worsening of a pre -existing condition will be considered 
an AE.  
AEs do not  include the following:  
• Medical/surgical procedures are not AEs (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth 
extraction, transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if the 
procedure was not planned at the Screening visit.  
• Overdose of concomitant m edication without any signs or symptoms unless the 
subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120004] (situation where an 
untoward medical occurrence has not occurred).  
• Disease progression.  
 
All AEs, whethe r observed by [CONTACT_205175], should be recorded individually on an AE CRF page with the following 
information: the specific event or condition, the dates of occurrence, duration, severity, 
relationship to study medication, action taken to study drug, outcome, and whether 
considered non -serious or serious.  
 
Once the subject has signed the informed consent form (ICF), AEs will be recorded up to 
and including [ADDRESS_244767] possibly related to study drug that occurs up to 5 years after 
the BL -8040 dose (donor) should be recorded.  
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 36 of 64   
For recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], Grade 3 -5 nonhematologic AEs will be reco rded from the start of the 
conditioning regimen until Day +[ADDRESS_244768] transplant.   
 
AE severity (Table 1) will be recorded and graded according to NCI -CTCAE (v 4.03).  
 
Table 111: Severity of Adverse Events According to CTCAE (Version 4.03)  
Grade  Description  
0 No AE or within normal limits  
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL  
4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
5 Death related to AE  
A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
 
The following definitions should be used for toxicities/AEs that are not defined in the 
CTCAE:  
• Mild (Grade 1): The AE is noticeable to the subject but does not interfere with 
routine activity, no medical intervention is required;  
• Moderate (Grade 2): The AE interferes with routine activity but responds to 
symptomatic therapy or rest;  
• Severe (Grade 3): The  AE significantly limits the subject’s ability to perform 
routine activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_4795];  
• Life-threatening (Grade 4): The subject is at immediate risk of death.  
The Investigator will document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_205126], using the criteria outlined in Table 2.  
 
The possible outcomes of the AEs are classified as follows:  
• Recovered: The subject has fully recovered from the AE with no residual effects 
observable  
• Recovered with sequelae: The su bject has recovered from the AE with residual 
effects observable  
• Ongoing: AE is not recovered  
• Fatal  
• Unknown  
 
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE Case Report Form, and if 
relevant, the Concomitant Medications Record in the CRF will be updated. The 
Investigator will assess  severity  and relationship to study drug (See Table 1  and Table 2  
respectively). Particular attention should be made to ensure no discrepancies between the 
AE and the SAE form (i.e. outcome, severity, relationsh ip must be consistent).  
 
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs observed after 1st dose of study drug.

10.1.2  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs ) 
 
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that suggests a significant hazard or side effect, 
regardless of the Investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_205127], but may not be limited to, any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death (regardless of the cause)  
• A life -threatening experience  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (any inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37350] a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 38 of 64  facility)  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Significant Medical event  
 
A life-threatening  adverse drug experience is any AE that places the subject, in the view 
of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does 
not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205128]/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205129], 
or that they occ urred as a consequence of the event.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -study condition (pre -Baseline) that did not 
worsen while on study and optional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205130] a clinical AE (e.g. 
elective cosmetic surgery) are not  considered SAEs.  
 
Significant medical events  are those that may not be immediately life -threatening, but 
may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensi ve treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; such an AE will normally be considered serious by [CONTACT_44134].  
 
10.1.3  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Events (S [LOCATION_003]Rs)  
 
A serious adverse event which is assessed as  related and is unexpected will be considered 
as S[LOCATION_003]R and should be reported in an expedite d manner (see Section s 10.8 and 10.9 ). 
 
Definitions:  
• Unexpected: a case in which in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) 
the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such 
as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) 
the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  is not expected to be 
present  
• Relationship: related or possibly related to participation in the research ( “possibly 
related ” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or 
outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
 
10.1.4  Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  failure to follow any appli cable regulation or institutional policies that govern 
human  subjects  research or failure to follow the determinations of the 
IRB.   Noncompliance may occur due to lack of knowledge or due to deliberate choice to 
ignore regulations, institutional policies, study protocol, or determinations of the IRB.  
 
 
Protocol Version : 10/25/17, Amendment: 4   Page 39 of 64  10.1.5  Serious Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  noncompliance that material ly increases risks that result  in substantial harm to 
subjects or others, or that materially compromises the rights or welfare of participants.  
 
10.1.6  Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition:  A planned deviation from the approved protocol that are under the research 
team’s control. Exceptions apply only to a single participant or a singular situation.   No 
exceptions to the eligibility criteria (Section 3.0) will be considered.  
 
Local IRB p re-approval of all protocol exceptions must be obtained prior to the event.   For 
secondary sites, the Washington University PI [INVESTIGATOR_205131], but it 
must also be submitted to the local IRB with documentation of approval forwarded to 
Wash ington University.  Washington University IRB approval is not required for protocol 
exceptions occurring at secondary sites.

Site activation is defined as when the secondary site has received official written documentation f rom the 
coordinating center that the site has been approved to begin enrollment.  At a minimum, each participating 
institution must have the following documents on file at Washington University prior to study activation:  
• Documentation of IRB approval of th e study in the form of a letter or other official document from 
the participating institution’s IRB.  This documentation must show which version of the protocol 
was approved by [CONTACT_1201].  
• Documentation of IRB approval of an informed consent form. The consent  must include a statement 
that data will be shared with Washington University, including the Quality Assurance and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (QASMC), the DSMC (if applicable), and the Washington University study 
team.

modifications and IB updates will be forwarded electro nically to the secondary sites within 4 weeks of 
obtaining Washington University IRB approval.  Activated secondary sites are expected to submit 
protocol/consent/IB modifications to their local IRBs within 4 weeks of receipt unless otherwise noted.  
Upon t he secondary sites obtaining local IRB approval, documentation of such shall be sent to the 
Washington University study team within 2 weeks of receipt of approval.  
 
Documentation of participating sites’ IRB approval of annual continuing reviews, protocol a mendments or 
revisions, all SAE reports, and all protocol violations/deviations/exceptions must be kept on file at 
Washington University.  
 
The investigator or a designee from each institution must participate in a regular conference call to update 
and info rm regarding the progress of the trial.

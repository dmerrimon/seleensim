PRECIS:  
Platelet transfusion can be a life-saving procedure in preventing or treating serious bleeding in 
patients who have low and/or dysfunctional platelets.  Treatment of blood cancer and other blood 
diseases as well as bone marrow transplantation is not possible without platelet transfusion 
support.  Unfortunately, 20-60% of chronically transfused patients will stop responding to these 
transfusions putting them at risk for serious bleeding complications.  Data support the concept 
that in many patients, platelet counts fail to increase after a platelet transfusion because the 
transfused platelets are destroyed by [CONTACT_10489]’s complement.  In order to overcome this problem, 
we will inhibit complement activity with the medication eculizumab that specifically binds an d 
suppresses complement.  We hypothesize that when we treat patients who have platelet 
refractoriness with eculizumab, the platelet counts will increase to higher numbers after platelet 
transfusions, decreasing the risk of bleeding complications associated with having a low platelet 
count.

2.0 BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION  
 
RATIONALE :  
Platelet transfusion can be a life-saving procedure in preventing or treating serious complications 
from hemorrhage in patients who have disorders manifesting as thrombocytopenia and/or platelet 
dysfunction. Treatment of hematologic al and non- hematologic al diseases as well as bone marrow 
transplan tation is not possible without allogen eic platelet support. Transfusing platelets 
prophylactically to prevent bleeding rather than waiting to treat active bleeding is now a common 
practice ( Blajchman et al. , 2008; Meyer  et al. , 2013; Slichter, 2007a ; Slichter, 2007b ). In 2007, 
1.5 million platelet products were transfused in th e [LOCATION_003] and 2.9 million in Europe. Depending 
on the patient, and disease characteristics , 20-60% of chronically transfused patients will 
ultimately  develop platelet refractoriness, making this a major world -wide health problem 
(Stroncek  et al. , 2007). 
 
Platelet refractoriness is defined by a lack of an adequate post transfusion platelet count 
increment . Platelet refractoriness is associated with bleeding complications , reduced overall 
survival and longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_365016] s(Rebulla, 2005; Slichter, 1998 ). The 
National Institute s of Health is a major referral center for hematologic disorders, including 
severe aplastic anemia (AA) , paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ), congenital 
thrombocytopenia, and a long list of premalignant and malignant hematologic al disorders. These 
patients  are characterized  by [CONTACT_182595], a hypocellular bone marrow, and suppression of 
hematopoiesis. One treatment modality that we utilize is bone marrow stem cell transplanta tion 
that results in recovery of the hematopoesis from engrafting donor stem cells. However, until 
patients  recover hemato poesis they remain pancytopenic. Thromobocytopenia leads to petechiae 
of the skin and mucous membranes, epi[INVESTIGATOR_365017], menses that last more than  a month, and gum 
bleeding. Bleeding can be brisk in the presence of accompanying physical lesions, as in gastritis 
  5 
Protocol # 15-H- [ADDRESS_456043] feared complication of thrombocytope nia is 
intracranial hemorrhage which has a high degree of mortality. The only modality to prevent life 
threatening hemorrhage is platelet transfusion . However, patients who develop platelet 
refractoriness do not respond to platelet transfusions . Any treatment that prevents platelet 
destruction in these patients  until recovery of hematopoiesis and endogenous plat elet recovery  
occurs would potentially be lifesaving.  
 
As with other centers, our institute performs bone marrow transplantation which  is not possible 
without adequate platelet support. Management of platelet refractoriness  in our center focuses on 
using HLA- matched platelets  (Banaji  et al. , 1986; Nambiar  et al. , 2006; Pavenski  et al. , 2013 ; 
Schiffer  et al. , 1983 ).  However, H LA-matched platelets are not al ways available, and incur 
significant expense to support an infrastructure for the accrual of HLA matched donors, limiting 
their collection to tertiary medical centers.  Attempts to reduce the production of HLA antibodies 
using immunosuppressive agents (e. g. IVIG, cyclosporine, steroid) typi[INVESTIGATOR_365018] a 
sustained resolution of platelet refractoriness (Blanchette, 1985; Christie  et al. , 1993; Reiner  et 
al., 1995 ; Schiffer  et al. , 1984; Slichter  et al. , 1987; Tilly  et al. , 1990; Zeigler  et al. , 1991). 
 
Platelet refractoriness  is calculated based on pre- and post-transfusion platelet counts, the 
number of transfused platelets, and the patient’s weight. The most commonly used definition to 
establish platelet refractoriness is a post-transfusion corrected count increment (CCI) less than 
7500/uL 10-60 min following the transfusion, and less than 5000/uL at the 18-24 hrs time 
points( Novotny, 1999 ). CCI = (absolute count increment x body surface area)/number of platelet 
transfused.  Immune and non- immune causes have been implicated in the mechanism of platelet 
refractoriness. Immune causes involve alloimmunization against human leukocyte antigens 
(HLA), and human platelet antigens (HPA) following patient exposure to lymphocytes through 
transfus ion, and pregnancy ( Rebulla, 2005; Slichter, 1998).  
 
While clinical studies have described the phenomenon of platelet alloimmunization in detail, a 
full elucidation of its pathophysiology remains elusive. The majority of clinically relevant HLA antibodies have been shown to be immunoglobulins G and M (IgG and IgM) which are directed against HLA class I epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], namely, HLA -A and B antigens. When patient s generate IgG and 
IgM to allogeneic platelets, it is assu med the destruction of platelets occurs by [CONTACT_365024], namely eradication via the reticuloendothelial system (RES), 
ADCC, and complement activation.  However, the inability to overcome platelet refractoriness by 
[CONTACT_365025], high dose infusions of  IVIG , and splenectomy  have 
established  that full saturation of the RES and FcRIIIA  (result ing in full inhibition of NK -cell 
mediated ADCC ) alone is insufficient to prevent platelet destruction, highlighting the  important 
role comple ment plays in the pathophysiology of this process ( Kickler  et al. , 1990; Pavenski  et 
al., 2012). 
 
Several assays are available to detect the presence of anti -HLA class I antibodies in the s erum of 
alloimmunized patients , including solid -phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and  flow 
  6 
Protocol # 15-H- [ADDRESS_456044] been shown that sera from platelet alloimmunized patients were able to fix 
complement on reactive cells leading to their destruction.  Heat inactivation of th e serum, which 
results in complement inactivation, completely overcomes this property ( Cines  et al. , 1979; Heal  
et al. , 1996; Heinrich  et al. , 1971; Lehman  et al. , 1987; Shulman et al. , 1962; Shulman et al. , 
1964).Similarly , allogeneic  kidney graft rejection/destruction occurs due to  the development of 
allogeneicanti -HLA antibodies . Recently, Loupy et.al demonstrated that anti-HLA antibodies  
activate complement pathways leading to kidney graft destruction (Loupy  et al. , 2013). 
Measuring complement levels C3, C4 and CH50 are widely available. These assays have low sensitivity , as complement system is very dynamic and replenishes itself quickly. However, in 
our preliminary investigation  we observed decrease in all three components of complement, C3, 
C4 and CH50, after platelet transfusion in t wo heavily HLA- alloimmunized patients (Table 1, 
Figure 1). This difference was not detected in a non HLA-alloimmunized patient, who received 
platelet transfusion ( Table 1). The difference in complement levels before and after platelet 
transfusion was detected when measured within 10 to 60 min after transfusion ended, however these differences were undetectable after 1 hour.  
 Taken altogether, these data overwhelmingly support the concept that platelet  destruction in 
alloimmunized platelet transfusion  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_365019]. Although 
the destruction of platelets by [CONTACT_365026], 
inhibiting complement activity to overcome platelet destruction and platelet transfusion 
refractoriness has not yet been studied. E culizumab ,is a monoclonal antibody that binds and 
inhibits C5 complement, therefore blocking  both classic and alternative pathways of 
complement.  Eculizumab is  effective in blocking comple ment -mediated RBC destruction 
associated with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_365020] (aHUS) , and has been approved by [CONTACT_365027]. Pharmacodynamic assays 
demonstrate that inhibition of C5 sufficient to prevent hemolysis occurs at eculizumab  plasma 
concentrations in excess  of 35 ug/ml. The m aximum plasma concentrations of eculizumab  with 
therapeutic doses of the drug are achieved within 1 hourof infusion with the half-life of this agent 
being 272 ± 82 hrs (mean ± SD)( Dmytrijuk  et al. , 2008). 
 
This research protocol is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of eculizumab to 
overcome platelet refractoriness which o ccurs as a consequence of complement activation.  To 
avoid the risk of bacteremia with encapsulated organ isms associated with comple ment blockade, 
we will vaccinate all patients with meningococcal vaccine and monitor them closely.  Subjects in 
this study are unable to wait [ADDRESS_456045] established that the 
benefits of this agent surpass the risks associated with complement blockade.

warrant terminating the treatment on this subject population, and we hypothesize that the actual response probability using this treatment would r each 60% or more.  We will determine the 
sample size using the Two -Stage design.  At the first stage, [ADDRESS_456057] stage, then an additional 4 subjects will be accrued, bringing the total number of subjects to n=10.  To account for dropouts, up to 15 subjects will be enrolled .

Protocol # 15-H- 0015  
Amendment M 
Georg Aue, MD  
January 5 , 2018 
 
 Adverse Event (AE):   Established adverse events from administration of eculizumab, including, 
headache, nasopharyngitis, back pain, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, diarrhea, upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], myalgia, anemia, leukopenia will be monitored.  Any untoward medical occurrence in a human subject, including grade 3 or 4  (e.g., abnormal 
physical exam or below mentioned laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is characterized by [CONTACT_39132]:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study 
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Is judged by [CONTACT_52374] 
• If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s outcome.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) :  A serious adverse event that:  
• results in death; 
• is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred);  
• results in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• results in a persistent or significant incapacity;  
• results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition. 
 Suspected adverse reaction: Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 Serious event: An event is serious if it meets the definition of a serious adverse event (above) or 
if it requires immediate corrective action by a PI a nd/or IRB to protect the safety, welfare or 
rights of subjects.  Unexpected adverse reaction : An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
“unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in

 the current application. "Unexpected”, also refers to a dverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.   
Unanticipated Problem (UP) :  Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
1. unexpected  in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to 
a. the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents; and 
b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and 
2. related or possibly related  to participation in the research; and 
3. places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm  (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
 
Unanticipated Problem that is not an Adverse Event :  An unanticipated problem that does not fit 
the definition of an adverse event, but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], involves 
risk to the subject, affect others in the research study, or significantly impact the integrity of research data.  For example, report occurrences of breaches of co nfidentiality, accidental 
destruction of study records, or unaccounted- for study drug.  
Protocol Deviation (PD):   Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB approved research 
protocol.  Non-compliance:  The failure to comply with applicable NIH HRPP p olicies, IRB requirements, 
or regulatory requirements for the protection of human research. Noncompliance may be further characterized as:  
 1. Serious non- compliance: Non-compliance that: 
a. Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants.  
b. Decreases po tential benefits to participants.  
c. Compromises the integrity of the NIH HRPP. d. Invalidates the study data.  
 2. Continuing non -compliance: Non-compliance that is recurring. An example may be a 
pattern of non-compliance that suggests a likelihood that, absent an intervention, non-compliance will continue. Continuing noncompliance could also include a failure to respond to IRB requests to resolve previous allegations of non- compliance.  
 3. Minor (non- serious) non -compliance: Non-compliance that, is neithe r serious nor 
continuing.

the research will be limited to data analysis.  An FWA coverage agreement to cover this activity will be ex ecuted upon approval of Amendment M. 
 End of study procedures :   
Data will be stored in locked cabinets and in a password protected database until it is no longer of scientific value.  
 Loss or destruction of data:   
Should we become aware that a major breech in our plan to protect subject confidentiality and trial data  has occurred, the IRB will be notified. 
 Publication policy :  
Given the research mandate of the NIH, subject data including the results of testing and responses to treatment will be entered into an NIH-authorized and controlled research database. Any futu re research use will occur only after appropriate human subject protection institutional 
approval such as prospective NIH IRB review and approval or an exemption from the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research (OHSR).  
  9.[ADDRESS_456069] Selection: Thromobocytopenia leads to petechiae of the skin and mucous 
membranes, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], menses that last more than a month, and gum bleeding. The most feared 
complication of thrombocytopenia is intracranial hemorrhage which has a high degree of 
mortality. The only modality to prevent life threatening hemorrhage is platelet transfusion. 
However, patients who develop platelet refractoriness do not respond to platelet transfusions. 
Data support the concept that in many patients, platelet counts fail to increase after a platelet 
transfusion because the transfused platelets are destroyed by [CONTACT_10489]’s complement. Therefore, 
we hypothesize that when we treat patients who have platelet refractoriness with eculizumab  that 
inhibits complement , the platelet counts will increase to higher numbers after platelet 
transfusions, decreasing the risk of bleeding complications.

  9.4 Risks and Discomforts 
Related to eculizumab  
Eculizumab may cause: life -threatening and fatal meningococcal infections. Therefore, subjects 
will be immunized with a meningococcal vaccine at least [ADDRESS_456071] 
dose of eculizumab.  It may also cause Suppressed immune system, Headache, Back pain,  Nausea, Diarrhea, 
Vomiting , Abdominal discomfort, Hypertension, Fatigue , Pyrexia , Anemia , Leukopenia, Fatigue , 
Cough, Constipation, Myalgia.  
 
Related to  Blood Tests 
Some subjects may experience localized bruising at the site of venipuncture.  Some subjects may experience a vasovagal response.  In order to minimize the potential for fall injuries after a blood draw, subjects will be closely monitored for dizziness or lightheadedness before they are allowed to stand.  9.5 Risks in Relation to Benefit

 will be carefully explained to the patient or the patient’s surrogate, and a signed informed 
consent document will be obtained.   There is no prospect of direct benefit for the subjects on this study, but is likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the subject's disorder or condition.  The potential risk for subjects receiving eculizumab  in this study is that it may be toxic, 
ineffective, or both. However, eculizumab is utilized  for FDA -approved indication (Paroxysmal 
Nocturnal Hematuria, PNH)  and this study will attempt to minimize any significant variation 
from standard  clinical care.  
 The risks of this study are reasonable in relation to the indirect benefits that will be provided.  For adult research subjects, the level of risk is greater than minimal risk. (45 CFR 46.102)

 If there is an unexpected enrollment of a research participant for which there is no translated IRB approved consent document,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or those authorized to obtain informed consent will use the short form oral consent process as described in MAS Policy M77-2, 45 CFR 46.117 ( b) (2) and 21 CFR 50.27 (b) (a).  The English version of the IRB approved consent document will be used as the summary of the text to be provided.   We prospectively request the IRB approve the use of the short form consent process in up to five 
of enrollees who are non- English speaking.  We will notify the IRB at the time of continuing 
review of the frequency of the use of the short form process (number per language).   Should we reach the thres hold of five of participants, we will notify the IRB of the need for an additional 
use of the short form and that we will have the consent document translated into the given inherent language.  9.[ADDRESS_456073]

10.0 PHARMACEUTICALS  
 
10.1 Eculizumab  
We will use the ECULIZUMAB (h5G1.1 -mAb) Investigator’s Brochure , Edition 21.0, dated 
July 11, 2015 an d Soliris® (eculizumab) Package Insert as a reference.  
 
10.1.1 Availability Soliris® (eculizumab) will be provided by [CONTACT_365031].   10.1.[ADDRESS_456075] is formulated at pH 7 and each vial contains 300 mg of eculizumab, 13.8 mg sodium phosphate monobasic, 53.4 mg sodium phosphate dibasic, 263.1 mg sodium chloride, 6.6 mg polysorbate 80 (vegetable origin) and water for Injection, USP.  10.1.3 Storage and Stability 
Eculizumab is supplied as 300 mg single-use vials containing 30 mL of 10 mg/mL sterile, preservative-freeeculizumab solution per vial. Vials must be stored in the original carton until time of us e under refrigerated conditions at 2°C to 8°C (36°F-46°F) and protected from light. Do 
not use beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_177170]. Eculizumab should not be frozen or shaken. A single unit 300 mg carton contains one 30 mL vial of eculizumab (10 mg/mL).  
 10.1.[ADDRESS_456076] be diluted to a final admixture concentration of 5 mg/mL using the following steps:  
• Withdraw the required amount of eculizumab from the vial into a sterile syringe  
• Transfer the recommended dose to an infusion bag 
• Dilute eculizumab to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL by [CONTACT_365032] (equal volume of diluent to drug volume) of 0.9% NaCl Injection, USP; 0.45% NaCl Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose in Water Injection, USP; or Ringer’s Injection, USP to the infusion bag 
• The final admixed eculizumab 5 mg/mL infusion volume is [ADDRESS_456077] operating procedures.

Protocol # 15-H- [ADDRESS_456078] to room temperature (18-25°C, 64-77°F).The admixture must not be heated in a microwave or with any heat source other than ambient air temperature. The admixture should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.  
 The product should be administered by [CONTACT_12781] 35 minutes (range 25-45 minutes). It is 
not necessary t o protect the infusion bags from light while it is being administered to the subject. 
The subjects will be monitored for 1 hour following infusion.  Admixed solutions are stable for 24 hours at 2-8°C (36-46°F) and at room temperature.  If the 
admixture is prepared more than [ADDRESS_456079]’s visit, the diluted material 
should be stored at 2°C to 8°C.   If an AE occurs during the administration of the eculizumab , the infusion may be slowed or 
stopped at the discretion of the Investigator, depending upon the nature and severity of the event. If the infusion is slowed, the total infusion time should not exceed two hours in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years to 18 years). The adverse event must be captured in the subject’s source document and CRF.  10.1.[ADDRESS_456080] be recorded on the AE/Serious AE (SAE) page of the CRF.  The most frequently reported adverse events in the therapeutic trials were suppression of immune system, Headache, Back pain, Nausea, Diarrhea , Vomiting , Abdominal discomfort, 
Hypertension , Fatigue , Pyrexia , Anemia , Leukopenia, Fatigue , Cough , Constipation , Myalgia.  
 
Subjects who develop AEs of rash, hives, itching, and/or dysphagia of mild to moderate severity during their infusions while receiving  may continue to be infused as deemed to be medically appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. Medical intervention may include, but is not limited to: slowing of the infusion rate (with or without treatment). Any acute reaction will be treated according to standard medical practice depending upon clinical signs and symptoms. If a subject requires medical intervention measures, this  subject should remain at the investigational site for a 
minimum one -hour observation period after the infusion and until the patient is stable.  
 Inhibition of the terminal complement complexes predisposes subjects to infections with encapsulated bacteria. In particular, subjects treated with eculizumab are at increased risk for the development of infection caused by N. meningitidis, as infection with this organism is more 
  23 
Protocol # 15-H- [ADDRESS_456081]. The Investigator’s Brochure contains the detailed information.   Durin g the study, subjects must carry a detailed card describing the “alert” symptoms for N. 
meningitidis at all times. Development of the “alert” symptoms card will be the responsibility of Alexion or its designee. The triggers for seeking immediate medical attention are any of the following symptoms:  
• Headache with nausea or vomiting  
• Headache with fever  
• Headache with a stiff neck or back  
• Fever of 103°F (39.4°C) or higher with or without rash  
• Confusion  
• Severe myalgia with flu -like symptoms  
• Sensitivity to light  
 
Any subject experiencing any of the above noted symptoms will be seen by a physician as 
quickly as possible.  
 
10.1.6 Regulatory Status  
The FDA issued a letter on September 23, 2014 stating the use of eculizumab  in this study is 
exempt from IND requirements as stated in 21 CFR 312.2 (b) (4 ).  Specifically, the use is exempt 
because:  
1. The investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well-controlled study in support of a new indication for use, nor intended to be used to support any other significant change in the labeling for the drug.  
2. The investigation is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for a prescription drug product. 
3. The investigation does not involve a change in route of administration, dosage level, or patient population, or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of risks) associated with use of the drug product. 
4. The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for institutional review (21 CFR 56) and informed consent (21 CFR 50).

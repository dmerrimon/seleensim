Version 4.5 | 25OCT [ADDRESS_49537] -line treatment for hypertension. Of the more than 1 million veterans 
prescribed a thiazide -type diuretic each year, more than 95% receive hydrochlorothiazide, and fewer 
than 2.5% receive chlorthalidone. However, indirect evidence has been accumulating for many years 
that chlorthalidone may be more effective than hydrochlorothiazide at preventing cardiovascular 
events, by [CONTACT_2902] 20% ac cording to a recent network meta -analysis. Possible mechanisms for such an 
effect include longer duration of action, better nighttime blood pressure control, and pleiotropic effects 
of chlorthalidone. A randomized trial comparing the effect of the two drug s on cardiovascular outcomes 
has never been conducted, primarily for reasons of cost.  
We are proposing a new type of efficient, less expensive randomized trial (termed a “clinically 
integrated” or “point of care” trial) to answer the question of whether ch lorthalidone is more effective 
than hydrochlorothiazide at preventing cardiovascular outcomes in older patients with hypertension. 
Our primary outcome will be a composite consisting of: stroke, myocardial infarction, non -cancer death, 
urgent coronary revas cularization, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46981] . We plan to 
enroll patients over age [ADDRESS_49538] a 90% power with 2 -sided α = 0.[ADDRESS_49539] a 17.5% reduction in the expected 3% per year 
primary outcome occurrence rate in  the hydrochlorothiazide group, we plan to randomize 
13,700patients over 3 years and follow them for a mean of 3 years, for a total study duration of 4.5 
years.  
The key feature of our design is that, instead of employing local investigators, we substitute  centralized 
study processes and rely on usual primary care. Specifically, this involves: 1) identification of eligible 
patients using the VA electronic medical record system (EMR), 2) centralized recruitment and 
enrollment, involving permission from the p atient’s primary care provider, a  patient recruitment letter, 
and informed  consent obtained by [CONTACT_756] , 3) centralized placement of notes and orders using the VA 
EMR, 4) all patient care including the study drug to be managed by [CONTACT_47028] , and 5) 
centralized passive collection of outcomes and process variables using the VA EMR, Medicare, and other 
national VA and non -VA databases.

Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   7 II. Study Question  
Does treatment with chlorthalidone reduce cardiovascular outcomes  compared with 
hydrochlorothiazide in older patients with hypertension ? 
III. Background and Rationale  
A. Diuretics for hypertension  
Hypertension is the most common primary diagnosis in America (1), and [ADDRESS_49544] ugs in the US are antihypertensive  agent s (2). Thiazide -type diuretics are recommended as 
first line therapy  by [CONTACT_20248]/DoD hypertension guidelines ( 3) and by t he Seventh Report of the Joint 
Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC -7). JNC -7 
noted that “diuretics have been virtually unsurpassed in preventing complications of hypertension” and 
as a result “should be used in drug treatment for most patients wit h uncomplicated hypertension” (4 ). In 
a network met a-analysis of 42 trials involving 192,478 patients randomized to active drug treatment for 
hypertension vs. placebo, low -dose diuretics (usually hydrochlorothiazide or the thiazide -type diuretic 
chlorthalidone) were “the most effective first -line treatment  for preventing the occurrence of 
cardiovascular dis ease morbidity and mortality”  (5).  
B. Hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone  
Nearly all thiazide -type diuretic prescriptions  in the U.S.  are for hydrochlorothiazide. 
Hydrochlorothiazide is among the top [ADDRESS_49545] common ly prescribed drugs in the US (2 ), with 135 
million prescriptions written annually (6). In the VA national outpatient prescription database, of the 
more than 1 million veterans prescribed a thiazide -type diuretic each year from 2003 -8, more tha n 95% 
received hydrochlorothiazide, and fewer than 2.5% received chlorthalidone (7). From our own search of 
the subsequent 3 -year period 2009 -11, 1.5 million veterans received hydrochlorothiazide from the VA 
and 50,000 received chlorthalidone.  
The near ly universal use of hydrochlorothiazide has been attributed to a variety of factors, including 1) 
early aggressive marketing by [CONTACT_23104] ([COMPANY_006]) using “the largest pharmaceutical sales force in 
the world” ( 8), 2) its use in the early landmark VA hypert ension treatment trials, 3) its early and frequent 
inclusion into combination pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], numbering at least 28 preparations  (8), and 4) the ease of abbreviation 
to “HCTZ”, which may influence physician preference ( 9).  
Both drugs have been approved by [CONTACT_47029] [ADDRESS_49546] long been available 
as generics, and are included in the VA national formulary in the same drug class: USP code CV 701, 
thiazide -related diuretics. There is no patient characteristic that influences the choice betwee n these 
two drugs - it is based solely on physician preference.  
C. Drug dosages  
Both drugs were once commonly used at doses of 100 mg per day and higher, but by 1990, concern over 
the lack of reduction in coronary events from blood pressure reduction by [CONTACT_47030] (despi[INVESTIGATOR_46982]: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   8 efficacy for stroke), and further concern that this migh t be due to competing harms (particularly 
ventricular arrhythmias) from thiazide -induced metabolic abnormalities, led to recommendations to use 
lower doses of diuretics, including suggestions to use 12.5 mg  of hydrochlorothiazide (10 ).  
In the early 199 0’s, publications of randomized dosing trials from the  VA cooperative study group 
concluded that the doses  of 25 -50 mg of  hydrochlorothiazide were nearly as effective  as higher dose s at 
controlling blood pressure with fewer adverse metabolic effects , favor ing the use of 25 mg  and a 
maximum dose of 50 mg (11,12 ). Several randomized dosing trials of chlorthalidone found 12.5 mg per 
day to be effective, and found 25 mg per day to be nearly as effective as higher d oses with fewer 
adverse metabolic effects (13,1 4). Since then, doses of 12.5 -25 mg per day hav e been widely used  (15) 
and rarely exceeded for both drugs, with higher doses accounting for only 7% of VA prescriptions in 
2008 (7). However, several authors have pointed out that hydrochlorothiazide doses lo wer than [ADDRESS_49547] performed poorly in randomized 
trials ( 6). As a result, JNC -8 recommends target doses of 25-50 mg per day for hydrochlorothiazide and 
12.5 -25 mg per day for chlorthalidone ( 16). 
D. MRFIT – the first evidence that chlorthalidone may be more effective  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_46983] U.S. , evidence has accumulated over the 
past [ADDRESS_49548] indication was from the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) , a large 
randomized trial of a multi -component ‘special intervention’ to prevent cardiovascular events in which 
either hydrochlorothiazi de or chlorthalidone could be used as first -line treatment of hypertension in the 
special intervention arm. During the study, c linics that used hydrochlorothiazide were noted to have 
44% more coronary heart disease deaths than those using chlorthalidone .  In 1980, the MRFIT Policy 
Advisory Board changed the protocol, recommending chlorthalidone over hydrochlorothiazide for initial 
therapy, and lowered  the max imum  dose to 50 mg. Mortality in the former hydrochlorothiazide clinics 
subsequently dropped 28%  (which could , of course , partially reflect regression to the mean) . A recent 
analysis of the use of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide within MRFIT reported significantly fewer 
cardiovascular events with chlorthalidon e, though the findings of this non -randomized  comparison are 
confounded by [CONTACT_47031], randomi zed group, and lipid lowering (17 ). A separate non -
randomized analysis of MRFIT data concluded that chlorthalidone was associated with less left 
ventricular hypertr ophy than hydrochlo rothiazide (18 ).  
E. Indirect comparisons of randomized trial data  
Because of the MRFIT observations, most subsequent NIH-funded blood pressure trials have used 
chlorthalidone, including the Hypertension Detection and Follow -up Program ( HDFP ), the Systolic 
Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) , the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study ( TOMHS ), and 
the Antihypertensive and Lipid -Lowering Treatment to Prev ent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), and in the 
ongoing Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial ( SPRINT ), it is ‘preferred’ . The use of chlorthalidone in 
these trials  and of hydrochlorothiazide in many other trials  has enabled indirect comparisons of the 
effects of the two drugs against a third drug or class. Thus, hydrochlorothiazide resulted in wors e

Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   9 outcomes than an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) in men in the Second Australian National Blood Pressure 
Study (ANBP2)  (19), and worse outcomes than amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (with all patients receiving benazepril) in the 
Avoiding Cardiovascular Events in Combination Thera py in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension 
(ACCOMPLISH) trial (6), whereas in ALLHAT, chlorthalidone was found to be superior to  an ACE inhibitor 
(lisinopril) or amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] “in preventing 1 or more major forms of CVD” (though there was no difference 
in the primary outcome)  (20). These and other indirect comparisons have recently been combined into a 
focused network meta -analysis that estimated a 21% risk reduction  (p< .0001)  in cardiovascular  events 
with  chlorthalidone relative to hydrochlorothiazide that persisted (as 18% , p=.024 ) in an analysis 
adjusted for attained blood pressure ( 21). 
F. Relative Potency  
Several studies have found c hlorthalidone to have about twice the  potency  of hydrochlorothiazide  
(22,23,24) and this is reflected in the VA P harmacy Benefits Management  (PBM)  2009 evidence review  
(25). Two indirect meta -analyses have reported similar conclusions . Ernst et al (26) found that at 
identical doses, chlorthalidone had a greater effect than hydrochlorothiazide on lowering blood 
pressu re. Pederzan et al ( 27) considered the [ADDRESS_49549] equivalent effects at equally potent doses, 
which they considered to be 3 to 1. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_46984], in practice 
chlorthalidone is not used  in lower doses than hydrochlorothiaz ide ( 7,28,29). This may reflect greater 
awareness of appropriate thiazide dosing by [CONTACT_47032], 
rather than widespread belief that the potencies are equivalent.  There is essentially universal 
agreement  among experts  that chlorthalidone at 12.5 or 25 mg is equipotent to hydrochlorothiazide at 
25 or 50 mg (respectively).  
G. Possible difference s between the two diuretics  
No randomized trials have been conducted that directly  compare clinical (e.g., cardiovascular) outcomes 
of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide, but several short -term randomized trials have examined 
blood pressure and metabolic effects. Two recent short -term (10 and 12 weeks) randomized double -
blind trials of 609 and 1071  patients (respectively) compared blood pressure control and adverse effects 
when taking  chlorthalidone 25 mg or  hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in patients also taking an angiotensin 
receptor blocker  (ARB)  (30,31). In both studies, chlorthalidone resulted in lowe r systolic blood pressure  
by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_49550] a longer duration of action  than hydrochlorothiazide . The elimination 
half-life of chlorthalidone is 50-60 hou rs compared with 9-10 hours for hydrochlorothiazide ( 32). Ernst et 
al (23) randomized 30 patients to either chlorthalidone 12.5mg/day, titrated to 25 mg/day or 
hydrochlorothiazide  25 mg/day, titrated to 50mg/day. After 8 weeks, there was no significant difference 
in office systolic blood pressure (SBP), but  24-h ambulatory SBP  favored chlorthalidone over 
hydrochlorothiazide: -12.4 (± 1.8) vs. -7.4 (± 1.7) mmHg, respectively, P = 0.054, an effect primarily  
driven by [CONTACT_47033] : -13.5 ( ± 1.9) 
and -6.4 ( ± 1.8) mmHg, respectively,  P = 0.[ADDRESS_49551]

Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   10 found nighttime blood pressure to be a better pr edictor of  cardiovascular outcomes  than daytime blood 
pressure ( 33,34).  
A recent in vitr o study  reported that chlorthalidone reduced epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] -induced platelet  aggregation  
and increased angiogenesis more than the thiazide bendroflumethiazide ( 35). There have been n o 
reports of any related clinical effect s (e.g., increased bleeding), but these mechanisms could help to 
explain differences between thiazides in reducing vascular events  (36). 
In summary, given the longer duration of action , better  nightt ime blood pressure  control , and possibl e 
pleiotropic effects  of chlorthalidone , it is possible that chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide could 
have different long -term effects  on cardiovascular outcomes  even at doses that result in similar office 
blood p ressure s. 
H. Drug costs  
Although both drugs are inexpensive generic products, chlorthalidone costs the VA seven times as much 
as hydrochlorothiazide. According to VA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM), the cost to the VA for 
hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg is  1.6¢ per tablet and for chlorthalidone 25mg is  11¢ per tablet  (with half 
doses costing half as much ). Thus i f the approximately  1 million VA patients using hydrochlorothiazide 
(nearly all on 12.5 or 25 mg) were switched over  to chlorthalidone 12.[ADDRESS_49552] of 5¢ 
per day, the total increased cost would be about $[ADDRESS_49553] a variety of metabolic effects. They generally lower serum sodium  (36) and 
potassium  (27,38) levels and increase blood sugar  (39,40) and uric acid  (27,41) levels. In a small 
randomized trial ( 42), hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg per day  lower ed potassium by a mean of 0.44 meq/L 
more than placebo, regardless of whether potassium supplements or triamterene were added. Perhaps 
the best source of information on the eff ect of thiazides comes from ALLHAT , which randomized 33 ,357 
patients with hypert ension:  15,255 to chlorthalidone and 9000 each to amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_46985]. 
Overall, chlorthalidone was considered superior to the other drugs in preventing cardiovascular events 
(20).  The year -1 incidence of hypokalemia (<3.5 meq/L) was higher with chlo rthalidone (12.9%) than 
with lisinopril (1.0%) or amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (2.1%), but only 3.5% of the chlorthalidone group had a level <3.2 
meq/L, and,  in the chlorthalidone group,  hypokalemia was associated with fewer cardiovascular 
outcomes than was normokalemia  (38).  
According to UpToDate (43): “The severity of the manifestations of hypokalemia tends to be 
proportionate to the degree and duration of the reduction in serum potassi um. Symptoms generally do 
not become manifest until the serum potassium is below 3.0 meq/L, unless the serum potassium falls 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_46986] a potentiating factor, such as a predisposition to arrhythmia due to the use of 
digitalis. Symptoms usua lly resolve with correction of the hypokalemia.  … Muscle weakness usually does 
not occur at serum potassium concentrations above 2.5 meq/L if the hypokalemia develops slowly. … In 
addition to causing muscle weakness, severe potassium depletion (serum potas sium less than 2.5 
meq/L) can lead to muscle cramps, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria.”  In one study, occurrence of

Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   11 premature ventricular contractions was twic e as common when serum potassium was below 3.0 meq/L 
(43). 
In ALLHAT  (39,40), chlorthalidone wa s also assoc iated  with more inc ident diabetes  (defined as any 
fasting blood sugar >125 mg/dL)  than were the other drugs  (chlorthalidone: 14%, amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]: 11.1%, 
lisinopril: 9.5% ). While overall,  those w ith incident diabetes had more cardiovascular  deaths, incident 
diabetes in the chlorthalidone group had lower cardiovascular  deaths than incident diabetes in other 
group s, leading the ALLHAT investigators to conclude that  “there is no conclusive or consistent evidence 
that this diuretic -associated increase in DM risk increases the risk of clinical events ” (39), so “concerns 
regarding potential adverse diabetic effects associated with thiazide -type diuretic therapy should not 
inhibit its  use” (40). Roush  et al (44) recently reviewed this literature  and concluded that 
“Chlorthalidone -induced diabetes mellitus (DM) is “chemical diabetes” rather than DM leading to 
cardiovascular pathology.”  
Also in ALLHAT, chlorthalidone did not increase the rate of development of either end-stage renal 
disease  or of a 50% or greater decrease in glomerular filtration rate  compared with lisinopril or 
amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ( 45,46).  
Sodium, uric acid,  and gout were not followed in ALLHAT. Thiazides have been associated with 
hyponatremia in observational studies . In th e Rotterdam study, about 50 of 3400 patients treated with 
thiazides over 6 years developed Na < 130  meq/L , 4.5  times as many  as controls (36). However, in SHEP , 
patients randomized to chlorthalidone did not differ from those receiving placebo in sodium lev els after 
1 year ( 47).  
Similarly , in the observational Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, thiazides were 
associated with an increased risk of incident gout mediated by [CONTACT_47034] ( 41). A recent 
systematic review concluded “There is a trend toward a higher risk for acute gouty arthritis attacks in 
patients on loop and thia zide diuretics, but the magnitude and independence is not consistent. 
Therefore, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_46987]” ( 48). In HDFP , patients randomized to chlorthalidone had re duced mortality 
compared with usual care regardless of baseline uric acid level ( 49). In a matched sample comparison  of 
national pharmacy records , new onset gout epi[INVESTIGATOR_46988] , despi[INVESTIGATOR_3404] 2 drugs being used in equal 
milligram doses ( 50). 
The above comparisons involving thiazide vs . no thiazide demonstrate effects that are minor and of 
uncertain clinical importance. In addition, two studies from universit y (51) and VA ( 52) settings changed 
19 and 40 patients (respectively) on a stable dose of hydrochlorothiazide to an equal milligram dose of 
chlorthalidone. Both reported reduced blood pressure with no significant metabolic effects except for 
one instance o f hypokalemia in the university study.  
Changing from hydrochlorothiazide to a roughly  equipotent  half dose of chlorthalidone  (the intervention  
proposed in this study)  should result  in even smaller effects . In the randomized study by [CONTACT_47035] ( 23), 
hypokalemia < 3.5 meq/L occurred in nearly identical proportions  at 2:1 doses : 50% of patients on

Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   12 hydrochlorothiazide 25/50mg and 46% on chlorthalidone 12.5/25mg. Within the commonly used dosing 
range of 12.5 -25 mg per day, potassium reduction was found  to be equivalent for the 2 drugs in one 
meta -analysis ( 26), whereas the other found it to mirror the potency results, i.e. greater for 
chlorthalidone at equal milligram doses ( 27). In a Dutch population -based case -control study, 
hyponatremia was twice as common with chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide at equal 
doses, but no difference was observed comparing 2:1 dosing (5 3). In the short -term r andomized trials of 
609 and 1071 patients that compared equal doses (25 mg) of the 2 drugs  in patients  also taking an 
angiotensin r eceptor blocker , hypokalemia was rare, occurring in 1 -2% (30,31). Summarizing the 
metabolic data available for the 2 drugs, a recent review ( 54) concluded that “factors such as serum 
potassium, glucose, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], endothelial function, and oxidative status” “are either favorable to 
chlorthalidone or are neutral in arriving at a decision as to which drug is superior.”   
More recently, a  population -based observational study from Ontario compared effects of starting 
treatment with chlorthalidone (10,384 patients) vs. hydrochlorothiazide  (propensity matched sample of 
[ZIP_CODE] patients ) with a mean follow -up of about one year ( 29). Patients treated with chlo rthalidone 
received higher doses (despi[INVESTIGATOR_46989]), and were less likely to also be treated with an ACEI  
or ARB (drugs that raise potassium levels). Chlorthalidone was associated with a small non -significant 
reduction in the composite cardiovas cular outcome, from 3.4 to 3.2 per 100 patient -years  (adjusted HR 
0.93, CI: 0.81 -1.06) .  However, treatment with chlorthalidone was associated with significantly more 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46990] (not necessarily “for”) hypokalemia (0.69 vs 0.27 events per 100 pa tient -years, 
adjusted  HR 3.06, CI: 2.04 -4.58 ) and hyponatremia  (0.69 vs 0.49 events per 100 patient -years, adjusted 
HR 1.68, CI: 1.24 -2.28 ). The authors included hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46991] . Hypokalemia and hyponatremia 
were each  recorded as a secondary outcome noted during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46992] 100 
patient -years. In response to a letter suggesting  that the analysis  should be restricted  to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] 
“for” hypokalemia  (as primary diagnosis) , the authors  responded that doing so would result in so few 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46993] “such an analysis would be severely underpowered” ( 55). So while it is not known 
whether  chlorthalidone caused m ore hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] “for” hypokalemia, it is clear  that such 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46994].  
The Ontario study had  the advantages of large size and direct comparison of the two drugs in a 
population.  The principal disadvantages we re the  observational design  and the very small (and therefore 
potentially quite different) proportion taking chlorthalidone. I ncomplete adjustment for known 
confounders (e.g., for dose and co -treatment) or from unrecognized confounders  in the treated 
populations  could have influenced the findings , as noted in a letter by [CONTACT_47036]  (56). For 
example, chlorthalidone is likely used more often by [CONTACT_47037]. Review of US data 
indicates that chlorthalidone is used in patients with  more severe co -morbidities than those given 
hydrochlorothiazide ( 57). The Ontario study nevertheless  raises questions regarding the possible 
superiority of chlorthalidone. In the correspondence following its publication, both the ALLHAT 
investigators and the Ontario authors stress the need for a randomized trial, such as the one we are 
proposing, to reso lve this uncertainty (55,56).

Version 4.5 | 25OCT [ADDRESS_49554] and colleagues at the 
University of Iowa  (7,18 ,22,23,26,28), but those authors have stated that “we do not believe there is 
strong evidence to support the use of chlorthalidone over HCTZ” ( 22). Ernst and Marvin Moser (who 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_46995] 1950’s) wrote in 2009: “Whether hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone 
are interchangeable in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events is questionable”( 32). On the other 
hand, Messerli et al reviewed the literature and concluded that “there is no evidence showing that HCTZ 
in the dose of 12.5 -25 mg reduces myocardial infarction, stroke, or death” and argue that “if a thiazide -
type diuretic is indicated, either chlorthalidone or indapamide shou ld be selected” (6).  The 2011  [LOCATION_006] 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  (NICE ) guidelines for hypertension ( 58) recommend “a 
thiazide like diuretic, such as chlorthalidone…, in preference to a conventional thiazide diuretic such as 
bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide” , whereas the 2013 European Society guidelines dispute 
this and conclude that “no recommend ation can be given to favor a particular diuretic agent ” (59). 
A recent review from invest igators at the New Mexico VA (15 ) concludes: “The available evidence 
therefore supports both HCTZ and chlorthalidone as safe and effective drugs for treating hyperten sion. 
Although there are favorable trends both in terms of antihypertensive efficacy as well as clinical 
outcomes data with chlorthalidone compared with HCTZ, the results are not conclusive, and as such may 
not be enough to shift the treatment paradigm in favor of chlorthalidone, given the comfort level that 
most prescribers have with HCTZ. A head -to-head study looking at hard clinical outcomes, which may or 
may not ever be performed, may be the only way to resolve the ongoing debate as to which is the 
preferred thiazide for treating hypertension.”  Floyd and Psaty noted in 2012  (60) that “In the area of 
pharmacological drug treatment for high blood pressure, the current question of primary interest is 
whether health outcomes associated with the use of hydroc hlorothiazide and chlorthalidone may differ. 
…Reliable and valid comparisons between hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone will require a large, 
long -term clinical trial.”   
As suggested by [CONTACT_47038], it is extremely unlikely that a randomized  clinical outcomes 
trial of hydrochlorothiazide vs. chlorthalidone will ever be undertaken except by [CONTACT_47039]. Neaton and Grimm, U niversity  of Minn esota  Professors who 
participated in MRFIT, SHEP, and subsequent NIH hype rtension trials, have been lobby[CONTACT_47040] a trial 
since the end of SHEP more than [ADDRESS_49555] maintained that they will only consider a 5 year proposal

Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   14 capped at $1.5 million a year. The Director of the NHLBI Cardiov ascular division has recently written that 
“we can no longer afford to undertake randomized effectiveness trials that cost tens or hundreds of 
millions of dollars” ( 61). Apart from  a trial design such as  we are proposing, which may be  unique to the  
VA system , these investigators found it  impossible to design a study for an amount close  to this budget. 
Richard Grimm concluded a 7/29/13 email  to the principal proponent (FAL)  with: “ It looks like the last 
chance of getting a definitive answer for this incredibly important question is your VA proposal. ” 
K. Summary of evidence and potential impact of the proposed trial  
Direct evidence shows chlorthalidone to be more potent and longer -lasting than hydrochlorothiazide, 
and indirect interventional evidence from the Roush network meta -analysis ( 21) suggests that 
chlorthalidone may have a more ben eficial effect on cardiovascular events, whereas  the large Ontario 
observational study ( 29) did not find a significant  reduction in adverse cardiovascular events. In 
comparing these [ADDRESS_49556] Treatment Comparisons Good Research Practices Task Force concluded that “a 
network meta -analysis must be considered observational evidence, but is arguably less prone to 
confounding bias than an observational comparative (prospective)  cohort study” ( 62). 
Currently available data thus favor a likely substantial benefit from chlorthalidone compared with 
hydrochlorothiazide, but these data have had little  effect on prescribing, which continues to 
overwhelmingly favor hydrochlorothiazide.  
If cardiovascular events were reduced by [CONTACT_47041] a small amount by [CONTACT_47042], the public health 
effect would be considerable because of the large number of patients  who  take  diuretics . For the VA, it 
would likely justify the effort and cost of implementing a national policy to change  drugs. However, the 
evidence is not yet persuasive enough to justify active measures  directed at increasing chlorthalidone 
use. A randomize d head -to-head comparison of the effectiveness of these two drugs at reducing 
cardiovascular events is clearly necessary to determine whether chlorthalidone is superior and if so, to 
justify efforts to change practice.  
IV. The Point of Care Program within the VA’s Office of Research and Development  
A. Program Background  
Medical decision making is informed by [CONTACT_47043].  While clinical trials are 
the gold standard in clinical research the high cost of conducting these studies combine s with issues of 
generalizability  to limit their contribution to changes in medical practice.  Observational studies are far 
less expensive and thus more numerous, addressing a broader scope of clinical issues.  However, their 
primary failing is that the l ack of randomization often leaves open the possibility of bias due to selection 
by [CONTACT_35151], and residual confounding of results due to unobserved prognostic factors that influence 
treatment decisions.   
Point of care (POC) randomization represents an in termediate strategy between these two approaches.  
The intent is to introduce the opportunity to randomize patients at decision points in clinical care where 
 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   15 two or more alternatives are considered equivalent on average by [CONTACT_47044] (that is , 
clinical equipoise exists).  Patients who agree to  be random ly assigned to treatment options will become 
subjects in the clinical experiment.     
POC randomization  preserves the experimental quality of clinical trials without the cost of the clinical 
trial apparatus; recruitment and randomization is done at the point of care with minimal perturbation of 
work flow, and outcomes are assessed by [CONTACT_47045].  
Reduction of the need for research staff interaction with pote ntial subjects (limited to obtaining 
informed consent) greatly reduces cost and generates data that reflects the effectiveness  (rather than 
efficacy) of experimental interventions in clinical care.   
To be effective, the additional burden on patients and h ealth care providers imposed by [CONTACT_47046].  The VA electronic medical record system (VistA) can be customized to 
identify, enroll and randomize patients and serve as the source of outcomes data and is thus well suited 
for such a tri al design.  Subject recruitment and enrollment will be accomplished by [CONTACT_47047] a series of dialog boxes.  Furthermore, an external system 
will extract consent and randomization data from the databases supporting VistA.  
As noted in a recent editorial ( 63), “With optimal use of EMRs, the administrative costs of a trial need 
not increase with the sample size; this decoupling of costs and size facilitates large, simple, and 
inexpensive trials that have the potential to transform health systems into entities that learn and 
continuously improve.”  
As the VA system continues to lead in the development of EMR that support increasingly sophisticated 
monitoring for outcome -based evaluation of care, we anticipate th at the methods we test using POC 
randomization will have even greater scope for application. The methods are also a natural fit for testing 
personalized and precision medicine strategies and for experimental comparative effectiveness 
research.  
B. POC Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] S tudy  
The first implementation of POC randomization is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_46996] 3 VAMC across 2 
VISNs. The goal of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_46997]:  
 
1. To test the feasibility of the method for modification of VistA/CPRS screens and the ability to 
randomize within the system;  
2. To assess patient and provider acceptance of the new methodology;  
3. To assess the regulatory acceptance of:  
a. Informed consent procedures;  
b. Safety monitoring;  
c. Ethical considerations;  
4. To test the method for data extraction and passive collection of endpoint data using the EMR;  
5. To apply Informatics techniques to refine and improve efficiencies in the identification of 
endpoints, etc.

Version 4.5 | 25OCT [ADDRESS_49557] strategies  of insulin administration for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46998] -label, randomized trial comparing sliding scale regular insulin (ssRI) to a 
weight based regimen for control of hyperglycemia in non -ICU inpatients. The strategy is to enroll 
patients into the study directly from the point of contact [CONTACT_47048] . 
All non -ICU patients who require in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46999].  Clinicians decide 
at the time of care (through the Vist A order entry screen for insulin) whether or not they will allow their 
patient to be contact[CONTACT_47049].  If the treating clinic ian agrees, consent ing patients are 
randomized to treatment arms and treated by [CONTACT_47050]. All technical 
modifications necessary are executed within the “Clinical Alert” package. Consenting patients are then 
followed through VistA from randomization until [ADDRESS_49558] discharge.   Comparisons of effectiveness 
will be formally  conducted using length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47000].  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_47001]. To date,  92% of eligible patients have accepted participation and ha ve been consented into the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_47002]. Additionally, 71% of all clinicians that are able to order medications have accepted 
randomization within the clinic and have referred their patients to the protocol.  All patient data has 
been extracted from the EMR and has been validated with chart review by a qualified clinician. T here 
have been no significant s afety events and no findings from regulatory audits or the local institutional 
review boards.  
C. The POC National Program  
The goal of POC program  is to del iver state of the art treatments to patients simultaneously with 
enrolling them as subjects to redefine that care. By [CONTACT_47051] a process of statistically sound and 
efficient learning, and by [CONTACT_47052], the 
participating VA health care systems will accelerate improvements in the effectiveness of care for 
veterans.  With this goal in mind, Point of Care Research has been designated as one of the Secretary’s 
(SECVA) Transformational Initi atives within the VA and within the Office of Research and Development 
(ORD).  Accordingly, this initiative has a national scope and an operating budget of approximately 
$10.2Million  (exclusive of study budgets) .    
The [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  has been tasked with le ading the effort to implement POC randomization within the 
VA. To that end, our mission is to build the infrastructure necessary to support POC research; to educate 
providers, veterans  and investigators on the initiative; to build consensus for support of the initiative 
among the VA community as a whole; and to explore the ethical, scientific, and regulatory aspects of the 
POC method itself.  In order to fulfill its mission, the [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  collaborates with national leaders in 
the fields of medical ethics and pragmatic clinical trials to produce scholarly works and it will conduct 
focus groups of veterans, veteran service organizations, and providers in order to develop a national 
educ ational campaign for all VA stakeholders.   
V.  Relevance of our trial design to current needs of VA healthcare  
 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT [ADDRESS_49559] to learn if medical interventions provide more benefit than harm for our patients 
is through large randomized trials ( 64). Ho wever, large randomized trials that enroll thousands of 
patients can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, placing them out of range for most payers, including 
VA.  As a result, many important questions remain unanswered.  
We are proposing herein a ‘clinic ally integrated’ study design ( 65,66) that will incorporate and extend  
previously described VA ‘Point of Care’ Clinical Trial methodology  (67,68). This is an efficient and 
inexpensive design , that will  rely on  a centralized processes involving mail, phone,  and data extraction 
from the  VA electronic medical record s (EMR)  , assisted by a  designated study champi[INVESTIGATOR_47003] 
(the Site Liaison ) and by [CONTACT_47053] (CACs) . These methods will allow us to 
avoid having to employ study personnel at each site to manage patients and collect data.  As a result, the 
infrastructure costs typi[INVESTIGATOR_47004].  The goal, as Lauer and D’Agostino sugges t, is “to design and conduct 
megatrials with what we have: bigger data and smaller budgets” ( 61). 
The following quotes, excerpted from the 2011 Institute of Medicine report “Learning what works best - 
the nation’s need for evidence on comparative effective ness in health care”( 69), provide support for our 
study objectives and design:  
“A core objective for the nation is achieving the best health outcome for every patient. This objective 
simply cannot be accomplished until we have better evidence on which to base healthcare decisions”; 
“the most rapi[INVESTIGATOR_47005] a timely 
fashion”; “Estimates of the proportion of medical care in the [LOCATION_002] that is based on, or 
supported by, adequate eviden ce range widely. However, given concerns about the extent to which this 
information may be generalized, and the quality of the evidence which is used, some place this figure at 
well below half.”; “Within the overall umbrella of clinical effectiveness resea rch, the most practical need 
is for studies of comparative effectiveness, the comparison of one diagnostic or treatment option to one 
or more others.”; “issues in need of additional systematic evaluation … include issues related to the 
comparative evaluati on of different drugs within a single class”; “A learning healthcare system is one in 
which the clinical research paradigm depends more judiciously on the serial conduct of randomized 
controlled trials —important, but often too expensive, untimely, and of l imited applicability —and draws 
more heavily on electronic health records (EHRs) to generate evidence as a natural by -product of the 
clinical experience.”  
More recently, the FDA has launched a Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative intended to promote an d 
enable the conduct of larger, simpler, less expensive randomized trials using streamlining methodologies 
such as use of electronic health records ( 70). 
In addition to addressing an important clinical question, our proposed trial is responsive to all thes e 
needs. This trial represents a new efficient methodology designed to provide reliable answers to 
practical clinical questions at a greatly reduced cost.

Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   18 VI. Study Design  
The study design is a m ulticenter clinically integrated ( 65) [or “point of care” ( 67,68)] prospective 
randomized open -label blinded -endpoint (PROBE) trial ( 71).  
VII. Study Population  
A. Inclusion Criteria  
Eligible patients are those (including women and minorities) who:   
1.  Are over age [ADDRESS_49560] recent SBP in EHR ≥ 120 mm Hg, with no SBP < [ADDRESS_49561] any of the following:   
1.  Impaired decision -making capacity rendering the patient unable to provide informed  consent  
(i.e., if there is any question during the nurse’s EHR chart review  that the individual does not 
have the ability to make an autonomous decision or the PCP declines permission to randomize)   
2.  Death expected within 6 months (inferred by [CONTACT_47054])  
3.  K< 3.1 meq/L (or 3.5 meq/L if on digoxin) in the pa st 90 days (assessed by [CONTACT_47055])  
4.  Na < 130 meq/L in the past 90 days (assessed by [CONTACT_47055])  
5.  Known to be enrolled in Medicare Part C (assessed through administrative data or on consent 
phone call) . This exclusion will only be employed if we dete rmine that we cannot obtain 
sufficient information from Part C data  (see below under Rationale ). 
Enrollment in another CSP interventional study is not an exclusion criteria for DCP.  Dual 
enrollment is addressed in Section IX. Study Procedures . 
C. Rationale   
We limit to age over 65 years to allow data collection through Medicare (which is only widely available 
starting at this age ) [and will exclude known Part C enrollees (those enrolled in Health Maintenance 
Organizations ), for whom usual encounter data is no t available through Medicare  if we determine that 
we cannot obtain sufficient information from Part C data] .  
We limit randomization to patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide because a) 95% of thiazide -type 
diuretic prescriptions are for hydrochlorothiazid e, b) there is little evidence to suggest that 
 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   19 chlorthalidone is inferior to hydrochlorothiazide, and c) the few PCPs who have deliberately chosen to 
use chlorthalidone over the much more commonly used hydrochlorothiazide are less likely to be willing 
to change drugs.  
We limit to hydrochlorothiazide doses of 25 or 50 mg because lower doses may not be effective and 
cannot be easily converted to chlorthalidone (which is available only in 25mg tablets), and because 
higher doses are not recommended and are rar ely used.  
We limit to SBP ≥ 1 20 mmHg primarily to minimize risk from hypotension, and also to avoid enrolling 
patients whose blood pressure is already low enough that a potentially more effective drug would not 
be expected to add benefit ( 72, 73). The cutoff point of 1 20 mmHg was selected, in part, because we are 
using routine clinic blood pressures recorded in  EHR to determine study eligibility. These are obtained 
using a less rigorous measurement protocol than is normally used in randomized trials and  that tend s to 
overestimate blood pressure (7 4), in one  study by a mean of 8 mmHg ( 75). 
We will attempt  to exclude patients in Part C as long as it appears that we will not be able to obtain 
adequate data. Part C data have not been available for research p urposes in the past, but CMS plans to 
make the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) for the years 2006 -2011 available 
sometime in 2015. We plan to check with CMS periodically , and if, before or during enrollment, 
adequate Part C data appear to be accessible, we will discontinue the exclusion and attempt to enroll 
these patients.   
VIII. Study Intervention  
Participants will be randomly assigned to remain on their current dose of hydrochlorothiazide (25 or 50 
mg), or to replace it with half that dose of chlorthalidone (12.5 or 25 mg, respectively), both changeable 
by [CONTACT_21122] . Chlorthalidone 12.5 mg will require tablet splitting, and a splitter will be mailed with the 
prescription. [Tablet splitting is a common procedure in VA pharmacy, sometimes i ncluding the splitting 
of hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg to get 25 mg.  A recent review (7 6) concluded that “Tablet splitting does 
not seem to significantly affect clinical outcomes related to management of hypertension, cholesterol, 
or psychiatric disorders, no r influence overall patient adherence.” ]  
Rationale for the default use of 1:2 chlorthalidone dose :  Because chlorthalidone is not used at lower 
doses than hydrochlorothiazide in practice (7, 28,29), it could be argued that the most appropriate 
pragmatic comparison would be a 1:1 substitution. We selected the 1:2 dose default for 3 reasons: 1) as 
noted above, the use of similar doses in practice probably reflects greater awareness of appropriate 
thiazide dosing by [CONTACT_47032], rather than belief that 
the potencies are equivalent, 2) a 1:[ADDRESS_49562] is in the former  question , and 3) an equal 
dose of chlorthalidone would represent an intensification of diuretic therapy, resulting in increased 
effects on bl ood pressure and blood chemistries ( 51,52,53), whereas the 1:2 design results in virtually no 
change in blood pressure or metabolic effects  (see Background and Rationale, parts F and I) .

Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   20 IX. Study Procedures  
A. Procedures prior to patient enrollment  
We will attempt to identify a “Liaison” at each site, usually a physician in primary care and/or 
hypertension management who se role will be limited to identifying key personnel at the site and 
introducing the study by [CONTACT_47056] (PCPS), pharmacy, the 
Information Resource Management service (IRM), Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs), and 
Information Security Officers (ISOs)  and subsequently referring all questions and comments to [LOCATION_011] 
CSPCC . The Liaison will n ot be involved in recruitment or have patient interaction related to the study.  
Because we are introducing a new design and intend to evaluate its success, PCPs are also considered to 
be research subjects (see XI. Biostatistical Considerations, F. Secondar y Data Analysis, 4. Primary Care 
Provider Metrics of Interest).  
Our procedures are summarized in a flow diagram ( Appendix C ). Working through the VA national ISO 
structure and local CAC’s and pharmacy personnel , we will obtain permission for [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  to have 
the necessary access to local EHR systems to enter notes and post orders as View Alerts to PCPs and to 
collect the study data on enrolled patients. Research staff at the [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  will be responsible for 
communicating with local PCPs, coordinating and implementing all patient recruitment activities  and 
completing the enrollment process including randomization and placing assigned treatment orders for 
signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_47057].  The [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  will partner with the Minneapolis  VA Medical Center s to 
conduct centralized calling activities, including contact[CONTACT_47058].  
We plan to roll out the study in blocks of sites. When a site starts up, the  [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  will generate a 
local list of PCPs along with their  eligible patients. We will also identify local PCP  and pharmacy email 
groups and obtain the PCPs ’ and pharmacists VA Outlook email addresses. The [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  will send 
an introductory letter  (by [CONTACT_47059])  to local PCPs signed by [CONTACT_47060] ( Appendix A.1, A.7 ).  Introductory emails (Appendix A.7) will be sent by [CONTACT_47061], while letters will be sent via ex ternal mail contractor. The Site Liaison  or study team  will 
present  information about the study  at primary care staff meetings and other forums (individual PACT 
meetings, video staff meetings for Community -Based Outpatient Clinics, etc.). If no meetings are 
available  the study  may use a video of slides accompanied by [CONTACT_47062].  This video can also be accessed at any time by [CONTACT_47063].  To further provider education, a second reminder email with an attached 
summary document and a link to the video will be sent to providers prior to being  contact[CONTACT_47064] ( Appendix A.8 ). The second email is to act as a  brief  reminder  of the study  to providers, not 
to act as an informed consent document.  
After these activities are completed, a View Alert ‘testpatient’ order will be sent to each PCP identified 
by [CONTACT_47065] . The testpatient order will accompany  a progress note containing the text of the 
Provider Information Sheet , which will contain the elements of informed consent and detail the study 
procedures ( Appendix B.3).  By [CONTACT_4876] ‘testpatient’ view alert order, the PCP is agreeing to 
 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   21 participate in the study as a research subjec t and allowing the recruitment letter ( Appendix A.2) to be 
sent to eligible patients . Alternatively, the PCP can “discontinue” the order, in which case that PCP will 
not be enrolled in the study and his/her  patients will not be contact[CONTACT_47066] . As some PCPs may 
discontinue the order because they did not recognize the  purpose of the ‘testpatient’ order we may  
send a second View Alert ‘testpatient’ order approximately  8 weeks  later to PCPs who decline to give 
the PCP the opportunity to participate and/or confirm their desire not to participate.  
B. Enrollment procedures  
The procedures described  below are summarized in a flowc hart ( Appendix C). Provider and patient mail 
will be sent primarily through an external mail contractor  and also b y the study team, as needed . The 
external contracted mailing vendor will receive participants’  names, addresses, information about 
treatment assignment, and other protocol procedures. No other patient health information will be sent 
to the mail vendor.  
Using the VA electronic medical record, the [LOCATION_011]  CSPCC will identify eligible patients of PCPs who 
signed the testpatient order .  The mailing vendor  or study staff will mail the study recruitment letter 
(Appendix A.2) with Informed Consent Information Sh eet (Appendix B.2) , which contains the text of the 
consent script  (Appendix B. 1), to these patients. The study team will attempt to send t he letter 3 -4 
months before the patient’s next planned appointment with the PCP  to make  it easier for the PCP to 
obtai n any follow up on blood pressure and laboratory tests  that the PCP might want . The VA Advanced 
Clinical Access/Recall system may prevent early detection of these appointments. The study Invitation  
Letter and the  Informed Consent Information Sheet will provide information about the study and the 
opportunity for the patient to opt out of futu re contact [CONTACT_18925] . Patients can opt out  by [CONTACT_47067] a 
voicemail with their name , date of birth , and the last four digits of their social security number . Patients 
that leave an opt -out message will only be contact[CONTACT_47068] i dentity cannot be 
confirmed . Additional Spanish letters will be sent to all patients in Puerto Rico and any patients that 
request a Spanish version. Any Spanish speaking Veteran will speak to a Spanish speaking study team 
member, contact a voicemail box re corded in Spanish, and will consent in Spanish.  
If no ‘opt out’ call is received within [ADDRESS_49563] patients  during follow -up calls. We will make multiple 
attempts to reach the patient, only leaving  a maximum of  3 spaced out message s. More than 3 will only 
be left  if the caller is returning the patient’s call . The U.S. National Health Interview Survey used a 
maximum of 15 call attempts and a 1994 study confirmed this number to be optimal ( 77). In 2 surveys 
conducted by [CONTACT_47069], nonresponse rates stabilized at 15 and 20 maximum call attempts (78). 
In the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Study, “most hard -to reach non-respondents  were called 
10 or more times” ( 79). A recent study at t he University of Minnesota ( 80) had an amendment approved 
by [CONTACT_47070] 2011 to increase the maximum number of call attempts from 6 to 12. Regarding left 
messages, Koepsell ( 81) “found that leaving a brief message about the study and promising a call -back 
improved the response rate by [CONTACT_47071] 20 percentage points”. If a Veteran expresses interest on the last

Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   22 call or leaves a voicemail after 15 calls, 3 additional call attempts will be made . On the phone call, the 
information included in the letter will  be reviewed and the patient’s informed consent will be sought 
using a pre -approved Telephone Consent S cript ( Appendix B.1). Research staff and study nurses may 
occasionally call consented patients to evaluate consent call procedures , discuss any concerns the 
patient’s raise , and to complete withdrawal procedures . Additional study information may be 
transmitted to Veterans, per their request , in the format that best suits their needs ( Appendix A. 12). All 
email communication between the  study team and Veterans will occur over My Healthy Vet.  The mail 
vendor or study staff may also re-send introductory study materials to Veterans if they have not been 
reached after 5 calls.  The mail vendor or study staff may also send a newsletters or re minder 
information to enrolled patients as needed  (Appendix A .15, A.10, A.11 ). At the end of recruitment a 
letter ( Appendi x A.20) will be sent to any patient who has not been given a study status. Meaning they 
have not decline d, agreed to  participate , or w ere otherwise found to be ineligible  in the study. This 
letter will not be sent to patients who have received  6 or more  calls, to avoid confusion.  Study data will 
be dispersed to all randomized patients via an  end of recruitment letter ( Appendix A. 23 ), consented 
PCPs will receive a the same information via email ( Appendix A.22 ) 
At the end of recruitment a ll consented providers will receive an email ( Appendix A.24 ) inviting them to 
participate in a participation survey ( Appendix A.21 ). In addition, Minneapolis providers will have the 
opportunity to take an in -person interview (Appendix A.25). The survey data will be  aggregated  to 
inform and improve future designs of pragmatic studies.  
After telephone consent is obtain ed, a preliminary e ligibility check will be performed to prevent sending 
randomization View Alerts  to providers for ineligible patients . If a patient is deemed eligible, a View 
Alert order will be sent to the PCP which , if signed by [CONTACT_21122] , will indicate permission to rando mize that 
particular patient. If a patient is deemed ineligible at that time, a determination will be made whether 
they are temporarily or permanently ineligible.  Temporary ineligibility may be due to lab values or 
blood pressure measurements out of inclu sion range that could change over the subsequent months.  
Temporarily ineligible patients may receive a letter indicating that they are not presently eligible, but 
will continue to be considered for randomization if their eligibility criteria change.  Elig ibility will be re -
assessed for temporarily ineligible participants periodically.  If a patient becomes eligible again six 
months or more after consent, a study team member will attempt to call the patient to reaffirm 
consent.  After three attempts the stu dy team will proceed with randomization. Randomization will yield 
a letter with study information allowing the Veteran to withdraw or contact [CONTACT_47072].  
Permanently ineligible patients will receive a letter indicating that they will no longer be  considered for 
randomization.  Alternatively, if the PCP believes that patient should be excluded for any reason (e.g., 
incompetence or short life expectancy), the order can be “discontinued” and the patient will then 
receive a letter saying that their PC P declined their participation in the study ( Appendix A.3). 
If an eligible patient is enrolled into another CSP interventional study prior to randomization in DCP, the 
DCP PI [INVESTIGATOR_47006] a conversation regarding dual enrollment with the other study’s PI.   If the 
investigators of both studies agree, they will sign a memo describing that agreement and any additional 
study activities or safety reporting requirements resulting from enrollment in both studies.  Additionally, 
this memo must be signed by [CONTACT_47073]’ respective CSPCC directors prior to randomization into DCP.

signed memo s.  
C. Randomization  
After the PCP signs the order  allowing the patient to be randomized , the patient will be randomized by 
[CONTACT_47074]. Randomization will be to chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide  with equal 
probability . Randomized group will be open label, but allocation will be concealed before randomization 
and irrevocable afterwards. All randomized patients will be included in the analysis according to the 
intent -to-treat principle. Outcome assessment will be conducted by [CONTACT_47075].  
We are thus proposing a “ prospective randomized open -label blinded -endpoint” (PROBE) trial ( 71). The 
rationale for our open -label design is several fold: 1) since there is no local coordinator, it is essential 
that the PCP manage the diuretic therapy, and we are concerned that thi s may not always occur if we 
use a blinded study drug, 2) there is no local investigator to assist with emergency unblinding, 3) we 
believe that keepi[INVESTIGATOR_47007], being more familiar and straightforward from the 
patient’s perspective,  will enhance recruitment, thereby [CONTACT_47076], 
4) local pharmacy management of blinded drug would require a level of effort and local engagement in 
research incompatible with our streamlined study structure, 5) the expe nse of producing a study 
preparation that is identical for the two drugs, and then labeling and tracking each patient’s therapy, 
would greatly increase cost, defeating the purpose of our highly efficient clinically integrated design. A 
recent meta -analysis  found PROBE trials to be comparable to blinded trials in terms of assessing 
antihypertensive drug effect on blood pressure measurements, though clinical outcomes were not 
examined ( 71). 
At the time of randomization, a templated text order  placed by [CONTACT_47077] a View 
Alert to the PCP. The order will indicate randomized assignment  and reference the associated progress 
note that provide s the following reminders:  1) when resolving the view -alert orders, the PCP can accept 
the order by [CONTACT_47078], 2) the PCP can discontinue  the order to continue their 
patient on his/her  current diuretic , 3) the PCP may wish to order any desired lab oratory  tests or blood 
pressure checks , and 4) the PCP should manage the diuretic in the future according to the patient’s 
needs.  
Patients will be sent a letter informing them of their randomized group ( Appendix A.4). Patients 
assigned to hydrochlorothiazide will simply remain on their current presc ription. For patients 
randomized to chlorthalidone , the [LOCATION_011]  CSPCC will also generate View Alert orders to the PCP 
cancelling the hydrochlorothiazide prescription and replacing it with chlorthalidone . Patients 
randomized to chlorthalidone will be instruc ted to discard their hydrochlorothiazide pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] , and will be 
reimbursed for their co -pay on the discarded pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] . The change from hydrochlorothiazide to 
chlorthalidone is a typi[INVESTIGATOR_47008].

E.  Rationale for elements of composite primary outcome  
The elements of the composite primary outcome are intended to represent the clinically important 
effects of diuretic therapy for hypertension. Myocardial infarction and stroke are traditional outcomes 
for cardiovascular clinical trials and will not be further justified here.  
Stroke . Stroke is defined from the American  Heart Association/American Strok e Association updated 
definition of stroke for the 21st century (83) and includes central nervous system infarction (brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_36232], or retinal) attributable to ischemia based on neuropathological, imaging, and/or clinical evidence; 
ischemic stroke acc ompanied by [CONTACT_47082]; and stroke caused by [CONTACT_47083], 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, or cerebral venous thrombosis. Stroke also includes any epi[INVESTIGATOR_47011], persistin g ≥24 hours or 
until death, but without sufficient evidence to be classified as one of the above. We exclude silent 
central nervous system (CNS) infarction, silent cerebral hemorrhage, major brain trauma including 
subdural hematoma or hemorrhaging, intracr anial neoplasm or metastasis, coma due to metabolic 
disorders or disorders of fluid or electrolyte balance, peripheral neuropathy, or central nervous system 
infections.  
Myocardial infarction . Myocardial infarction is defined from the third universal definition as evidence of 
myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischemia (84).

positivity and would be classified as myocardial infarctions in a classic trial design with in -depth outcome 
review (Christopher P. Cannon , MD, pers onal  comm unication, Aug 2013 ). Including urgent coronary 
revascularization in our study will prevent  us from missing these infarctions. Urgent coronary 
revascularization  is more restrictive than the revascularization outcome usually  reported in previous 
trials  and selects for the most clinically relevant events.  For example, in the  PEACE trial of patient s with 
stable coronary artery disease  and normal ejection fraction  (85), “all coronary revascularizations” were 
more frequent than all the other events  combined  that make up  our composite. On the other hand, in 
the (TRA2°P) -TIMI 50 trial of an antiplatelet  agent in patients with vascular disease ( 86), urgent coronary 
revascularization because of unstable angina was less frequent than myocardial infarction and similar  in 
frequency  to cardiovascular death or stroke , and  increased the composite rate  in the placebo group 
from 10.5%  for those 3 outcomes  to 12.4% for those 3 outcomes plus urgent revascularization .  
Reductions in urgent coronary revascularization represent  an important contribution  to the overall 
effectivenes s of therapy. T he observed reductions in urgent revascularizations in randomized trials are  
concordant with changes in other major outcomes . In (TRA2°P) -TIMI 50  (86), the hazard ratio  for the 
primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death , myocardial in farction , or stroke was 0.87, and for 
urgent coronary revascularization was 0.88.  Urgent coronary revascularization has also been used in 
TRACER ( 87) and is being used in EXAMINE ( 88). CSSEC recently approved a broad er revascularization 
outcome for VA CSP  #593, the VA Fenofibrate Intervention Trial ( VA-FIT) (for which the indications 
included stable angina with a >50% target lesion ). 
In summary, urgent coronary revascularization is a significant contributor to cardiovascular morbidity 
and health care costs, its inclusion will allow assessment of the full impact of therapy, and its relative 
contribution to overall endpoints is not antic ipated to be disproportionate to that of other study 
outcomes. Our definition of urgent coronary revascularization will consider completed or attempted 
coronary revascularization procedures performed because of unstable angina. Unstable angina is further 
defined as any increase in angina, and/or  inadequate response to increased anti -anginal therapy  cited as 
the reason (s) for the procedure, and with the medical record citing that increased angina and/or  
inadequate response to increased anti -anginal therapy o ccurred within [ADDRESS_49568] patients with established heart failure are maintained on a loop

we will assess in our algorithm.  
Heart failure  is a major public health problem  with a profound  impact on prognosis  and also on costs, 
and is the most frequent cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47013] 65 years ( 89). Its impact  is 
summarized in  the AHA 2013 u pdate  (90): “HF incidence approach es 10 per 1000 population after 65 
years of age ”, …“approximately 50% of people diagnosed with HF will die within 5 years”,  …“One in 9 
deaths has HF mentioned on the death certificate”, …“In 2009, HF any -mention mortality was 274 601 ” 
and “HF was the underlying cause in 56 410 of those deaths” .  
Heart failure  and stroke are the two major cardiovascular outcomes most related to hypertension and 
most benefited by [CONTACT_47084]. Seventy -five percent of heart failure cases have 
antecedent hypertension ( 90). The Framingham Heart Study  (91) found the highest risk ratio  from 
hypertension to be for heart failure in men (Figure 1).  
  
Figure 1.  A prospective analysis of the 36 -year follow -up data from the Framingham Heart Study (91) 
demonstrates that hypertens ion (blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) predisposes to all major  
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes, but the largest risk ratios are for  cardiac failure  and 
stroke in men . 
Diuretic -based treatment arms in outcome trials have reduced HF by [CONTACT_5554] 50% over placebo 
(compared wit h 30 -40% reduction for stroke), and more effectively than calcium channel blockers and 
ACE inhibitors in comparative trials (Figure 2)  (5).  In ALLHAT ( 89), the alpha blocker doxazosin, the 
calcium channel blocker amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and the ACE inhibitor lisinopr il were associated with 80%, 38% and 
19% higher risk of heart failure compared with chlorthalidone. Therefore, heart failure is likely to be one

Figure 2.  From a network meta -analysis of hypertension trials ( 5). Heart failure ( CHF) can be seen to be a 
particularly effective outcome for discriminating  between diuretics and other drugs.  “CVD Events”

Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47014] s. In the 
principal ALLHAT  report  (20), there were 885 non -fatal MIs, 724 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47015], and 675 strokes. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18552] d heart failure events in ALLHAT attracted close scrutiny because 
they were reported by [CONTACT_47085]. The authors undertook a separate study in 
which they successfully validated these events ( 89), and from which they concluded “He art failure 
proved to be a common outcome in ALLHAT and one that was affected differentially by [CONTACT_47086]. In addition, patients who developed HF had significantly poorer survival than 
those who did not. Whether this poor prognos is can be altered presents an important clinical and public 
health question. Thus, in planning future hypertension treatment trials  (and perhaps also treatment 
trials in other populations at high risk of HF, such as diabetics and survivors of acute coronary

Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   29 syndromes) serious consideration should be given to including HF in the primary end point , along with 
death, MI, and stroke ” (italics added).   
Heart failure is reasonably  well identified using discharge diagnoses. In a population -based study of 4537 
case s of heart failure from Olmsted County MN, ICD -9 code 428 constituted 80% of heart failure codes , 
and 82% of the cases coded as 428  met Framingham criteria for heart failure when records were 
reviewed by [CONTACT_47087] ( 92). 
Identification of clinically important epi[INVESTIGATOR_47016]. The draft report of the FDA expert panel on Cardiovascular Endpoints in Clinical Trials 
(93) recommends inclusion of  the following  criteria for determining a heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47017] : 
“The patient receives initiation or intensification of treatment specifically for HF, including at least one 
of the following:  a. augmentation in oral diuretic therapy, b. intravenous diuretic, inotrope, or 
vasodilator therapy, or c. Mechanical or surgical intervention, such as i. mechanical circulatory support 
(e.g., intra -aortic balloon pump, ventr icular assist device) or ii. mechanical fluid removal (e.g., 
ultrafiltration, hemofiltration, dialysis) .” We will employ  these criteria  and others, such as exclusion of 
admissions for ICD placement , in our algorithms to maximize the likelihood that the eve nts we capture 
are clinically relevant . 
Non -cancer deaths . We include n on-cancer death s in our primary composite outcome as a compromise 
between total mortality, which includes many irrelevant events that dilute the effect of the intervention, 
and cardiovascular mortality, which is less accurately distinguished on death certificates and may  miss 
relevant deaths . We exclude c ancer deaths because they are  numerous, relatively accurately identified 
on death certificates ( 94,95,96 ), and believed to be unrelated to diuretic use , so exc luding them reduces 
“noise” relative to expected effects of th e intervention. In the Physicians’ Health Study ( 95), cancer 
deaths in patients older than [ADDRESS_49570] nosology  
protocols and the Automated Classification of Medical Entities (ACME) Decision Tables with s pecificity 
well over 99% compared with an adjudication committee, meaning that the deaths excluded from our 
primary outcome will almost certainly be due to cancer.  
Prieto -Merino and colleagues ( 97) note:  “If outcomes that are causally related to the trial  treatment are 
combined with those that are not, the estimate of the treatment effect is diluted towards the null and 
we may fail to identify potentially important benefits or harms…. Because few treatments will be 
causally related to all causes of death, all-cause mortality is a composite outcome that combines 
causally related causes of death with those unrelated to the treatment.” We did not restrict to 
cardiovascular deaths because some other deaths may be relevant, such as accidents due to syncope 
from hypotension  and deaths from unknown causes (which could have been  cardiovascular) , and other 
deaths (e.g., pneumonia, COPD) that are not accurately distinguished from cardiovascular deaths by 
[CONTACT_47088].  Competing risk from cancer deaths w ill be considered in a secondary 
analysis.

Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   30 F. Ascertainment of Outcome Data  
Data collection will be via electronic medical records , administrative data , Medicare and death records . 
We will use VA , CMS , and National Death Index  data.  Assessment of outcomes and relevant data 
elements as well as adverse event is by [CONTACT_47089]; the study 
will not attempt to generate any additional tests or procedures. All outcome processing will be 
cond ucted by [CONTACT_47090]. In this section we describe 
our approach to ascertainment and assessment of these outcomes.  
The [LOCATION_011] CSP Coordinating  Center has [ADDRESS_49571] (EHR) and CMS data.  We will build on 
this extensive experience to refine a specific procedure for doing the same in this trial in order to 
accurately identify and assess outcomes.  The pro cess involves several clearly defined steps.  First, we 
develop a method to screen the electronic medical records of all participants on a periodic basis  for 
potential cases.  This screening consists of comparing discharge diagnosis and procedure codes for  
enrolled patients to a list of outcome -relevant ICD [ADDRESS_49572] used at the [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  
for a number of years.  The screening approach is used to identify all potential cases using key elements 
in the EHR.  The screening tool varies for each outcome  (i.e. outcome -specific administrative diagnosis 
codes) .   
Second, algorithms are developed to collect and analyze data elements that are used to confirm or 
refute the potential cases  (e.g. presence of imaging during a stroke) .  The algorithms are based on 
elements of the clinical definitions of the outcom es, and are applied to potential cases to determine if 
the case is confirmed, disconfirmed or deemed indeterminate.  Algorithms for cases are constructed 
using “gold standard” cases (identified by [CONTACT_37061] ) and data elements  obtained from the 
medical record  that are  found in the outcome definitions, such as cardiac enzymes for MI.  Once the 
algorithm for a specific case is defined, the algorithm ’s accuracy is checked by [CONTACT_47091].    
Third, indeterminate c ases will undergo manual adjudication. We expect to be left with a relatively small 
number of events that cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_8106], but all of these will be referred for 
adjudication to an outcomes committee. This will greatly lessen the workloa d for manual adjudication. 
All patients will be followed until death or the end of the study (even if the primary outcome is 
determined to have occurred) to collect secondary outcomes , including death.

augmented with CMS data for all participants. Below we describe the approach to ascertainment of 
potential cases . Definition criteria  and ICD diagnostic and procedure codes for each outcome can be 
found in Appendix F (Outcome Definitions)   
G. Adjudication of events  
In cases  where the outcome diagnosis is not clear based on the screening mechanism and algorithms 
developed , we will resort to manual adjudication to determine the validity of the diagnosis.  Based on 
our [ADDRESS_49574] of a chart review by [CONTACT_47092][INVESTIGATOR_47019] a chart review of VA inpatient and outpatient 
records as w ell as CMS data following the discharge date for non -VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. In some cases, we 
may query the PCP as to whether a possible event occurred.  
Additionally, w e will also manually adjudicate 10% of all outcomes confirmed or refuted by [CONTACT_47093] a quality check on the algorithms. We will develop near -final algorithms during 
the study  and will continue to refine the algorithms and retrospectively apply these refinements to all 
data.   It is also important to note that b etween the time o f study approval and study launch, the VA has 
transitioned to using the ICD -[ADDRESS_49575] system , and Medicare  (e.g., acute gout epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] = ICD 10 M10.00 ). Blood 
pressures will be collected from routine clinic visits, and not from emergency room visits or inpatient 
stays , and only the reading with the lowest SBP of the day wil l be retained  (99).  Section XIII details the 
data sources and the data collection (i.e., data extraction) procedures that will be used.  When the study 
drug is discontinued, we may query the PCP as to the reason if not clear from the char t.  
XI. Biostatistical Considerations  
A. Overview of the Study Design  
The proposed study is a  prospective randomized open -label blinded -endpoint,  multicenter, two ar m 
intervention trial testing the effectiveness of chlorthalidone for prevention of cardiovascular events and 
non-cancer death among patients currently receiving hydrochlorothiazide.  The primary hypothesis is 
that chlorthalidone is superior to hydrochlorot hiazide for the prevention of cardiovascular events and 
non-cancer death over time.  
The primary outcome measure is time from enrollment in the study to the first occurrence of a 
cardiovascular event or non -cancer death.  Cardiovascular (CVD) events are def ined as stroke,

1. Estimated Incidence of the Primary Endpoint  
This study will randomize up to 13,700  patients, in 50:50 allocation to hydrochlorothiazide and 
chlorthalidone, in order to achieve 1,05 5 primary outcome e vents .  .  All subjects will be followed 
through the end of the four and one -half (4.5) year study period yielding an estimated average follow -up 
time of three (3) years.  We posit a four and one -half year rate of 13.5% of the composite outcome in the 
hydro chlorothiazide group and 11.1% in the chlorthalidone group.  We utilized the VA National data 
from fiscal years 201 0 to 2012  to identify a subgroup of subjects who would be potentially eligible for 
the proposed study.  Details of the analysis can be found in Section XII. Feasibility and Recruitment 
Plan . 
The cardiovascular event rate, using a composite similar to that proposed here, was 2% per year in 
ALLHAT (20 ) and ACCORD ( 101), and is projected as 2% for the ongoing SPRINT. Unlike those studies, we 
are limiting enrollment to patients over age 65 years and are not excluding very old or seriously ill 
patients (unless life expec tancy is known to be less than 6 months), and we are including all non -cancer 
deaths rather than only cardiovascular deaths, all of which would be expected to increase the event 
rate. For patients 65 -79 years old with no serious illness (and creatinine <1. 5 mg/dL) in ACCORD, the 
composite event rate (stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death) was 2.8% per year ( 96). 
Our event rate should be higher because we include urgent revascularization, acute heart failure, and 
non-cancer deaths. ANBP2 en rolled patients over 65 years but included all deaths in the composite, and 
observed an event rate of >4% per year ( 19).  
We believe that the most relevant event rates for our study come from the Ontario observational study 
(29) comparing chlorthalidone wi th hydrochlorothiazide, discussed above. The Ontario study is both 
recent, published in 2013 and reporting data from 1993 to 2010, large (nearly 30,000 patients), and 
shares important features with our proposed trial, including: 1) study patients are aged 66 and older and 
taking diuretics for hypertension, 2) outcome data were collected passively from administrative 
databases, and 3) the primary outcome was a composite similar to the one we are proposing, with two 
differences: a) they did not include urgent  revascularization, and b) they included all deaths whereas we 
do not include cancer deaths.  
We expect these 2 differences to very nearly cancel each other’s effect. The rate for the Ontario 
composite outcome was 3.4% per year in the hydrochlorothiazide g roup. The rate for all deaths was 
1.8% per year, or 45% of the total number of individual outcomes (some patients had more than one of 
the composite outcome elements). Many studies, such as the Physicians Health Study ( 95) have found 
that all deaths in thi s age group are comprised of roughly 1/3 each of deaths due to cardiovascular 
disease, cancer and other causes, suggesting that our exclusion of cancer deaths would reduce the 
composite rate by 15%. In the (TRA2°P) -TIMI 50 trial ( 86), urgent coronary revas cularization was less

Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   33 frequent than myocardial infarction (0.82% in the Ontario study, or 20% of the total number of 
individual outcomes) and similar in frequency to stroke (0.46% in the Ontario study, or 11% of the total 
number of individual outcomes), su ggesting that our inclusion of this outcome will raise the composite 
by 10 -15%.  
These adjustments result in a best estimate for the expected composite rate of about 3.2% per year. For 
the proposed study, because event rates tend to decrease over time, we conservatively project a 3% per 
year event rate in the hydrochlorothiazide group.  
2. Effects of the Intervention  
Of 125,000 VA patients started on drug in routine practice in 2004, 72% of hydrochlorothiazide users 
and 62% of chlorthalidone users remained on the drug 1 year later (2 8). Onsite coordinators in standard 
trials may be able to maintain better drug adherence than occurs in usual practice. ACCORD (101) and 
SPRINT (84) considered a 20% relative reduction to be an appropriate minimum import ant difference for 
power calculations. Because the difference in outcomes in our study could be reduced by [CONTACT_47094], we reduce the minimum important 
difference value to 17.5% .  A reduction in C VD events or non -cancer death of this magnitude or greater 
would be considered clinically significant.  
B. The Primary Analysis  
We posit a four and one -half event rate of 13.5% in the hydrochlorothiazide group and a 17.5% 
reduction of CVD events in the chlorthalidone group to inform our primary hypothesis.  
Formal statement of the primary hypothesis  
 Under the null hypothesis:  
    The 4.5 year event rate will be 13.5% (or 578 primary events)  
 Under the alternative hypothesis for study participants treated  with chlorthalidone:  
    The 4.5 year event rate will be 11.1% (or 477 primary events)  
 
The reductions attributed to chlorthalidone may be viewed in several ways.  The absolute reduction 
from 13.5% to 11.1% is 2.4%, the relative reduction is (13.5 – 11.1) /13.5 = 17.5% , and the hazard ration 
(chlorthalidone hazard rate/hydrochlorothiazide hazard rate) of 0.[ADDRESS_49577] between 
the simple odds ratio, 11.1(100 -13.5)/13.5(100 -11.1) = 0.80 and the risk ratio 11.1/13.5 = 0.82.  
 
Formally, t he null hypothesis is that the two treatment groups do not differ in their time -to-event 
hazard rates.  The alternative  hypothesis is that chlorthalidone has a lower or higher hazard rate than 
hydrochlorothiazide therapy with a hazard ratio for chlorthalidone compa red to hydrochlorothiazide 
less than 0.[ADDRESS_49578] is two -sided allowing fo r chlorthalidone to be either more or less effective 
than hydrochlorothiazide.  A significant difference showing that the intervention chlorthalidone

Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   34 compared to the control hydrochlorothiazide decreases (or increases) the hazard of a major 
cardiovascular event will be regarded a positive result. The results for the primary outcome measure will 
be analyzed by [CONTACT_47095] -sided log -rank test to detect either a hazard ratio that exceeds 1.[ADDRESS_49579] a two -sided 4.9% type  I error.  The test has 90% power to detect a 
hazard ratio of 1.22 or larger or 0.82 or less with a total of 1,055 primary outcome events .   The 
remaining Type I error of 0.1% is used for the interim analysis.   
If the annual event rate is 2.5% (rather than the posited 3%), then the study has 84% power; if 2% , it has 
75% power.   
D. Primary Data Analysis  
The primary outcome hypothesis will be a time -to-event analysis with the use of a two -sided log -rank 
test based on intention -to-treat principles.  The model will not include any covariates.  Analytic reports 
will include hazard rates, their ratio, and the 95% confidence interval about the ratio.   
This will be followed by [CONTACT_47096] -adjusted exploratory analyses, using Cox proportional 
hazards regression modeling,  controlling for baseline factors.  Covariates will include demographic 
factors (e.g., age, sex, smoking status, education) and clinical factors (e.g., blood pressure, medications, 
comorbidities, history of disease, and BMI).  We will test the proportional hazards assumption by 
[INVESTIGATOR_3086] a time -treatment interaction term in the model.     
E. Interim Analysis  
We will perform one interim analysis when the 500th event occurs, approximately 3.[ADDRESS_49580]  a type I erro r of 0.1%, which 
negligibly decreases the overall type I error and has virtually no effect on the power to show that 
chlorthalidone is different from hydrochlorothiazide.  The sample size of 13, 532 accounts for the interim 
analysis  with a  corresponding inf lation factor, for increase in sample size of 1.001 , resulting in 14 more 
subjects per arm ( 102).  We will confer with the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) members and the 
program leadership for potential stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_47020] m analysis.  
F. Secondary Data Analys is 
1. Treatment Effect in Subgroups  
The Cox regression and competing risks modeling will explore the possibilities of treatment 
variation across pre-specified subgroups  based on status at time of enrollment including:  
a) gender,  
b) age (dichotomized at median),  
c) baselin e SBP (dichotomized at median),

f) diabetes vs. not,  
g) eGFR < 60 , and  
h) good compliance (medication possession r atio ≥ 80 %) with hydrochlorothiazide over the 
year before randomization.  
 
2. Individual Components of Primary Outcome  
In addition to the subgroup analyses listed above, each component of the composite primary 
outcome measure (stroke, myocardial infarction, urgent coro nary revascularization, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46981], and non -cancer death) will be separately 
analyzed using log -rank , Cox proportional hazards , and competing risks  model s to compare 
chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide.  The adjusted  analyses will inclu de the covariates 
considered in the primary data analysis . 
3. Additional Outcomes of Interest  (Analysis of Secondary and Tertiary Objectives)  
In addition we will run time -to-event analyses  comparing the treatment effect  on:  
a) all-cause mortality , 
b) the composite outcome substituting all deaths for non -cancer deaths,  
c) vascular deaths defined as all deaths caused by [CONTACT_37110], vascular diseases, external causes, 
and unknown causes,  
d) the composite outcome substituting vascular deaths for non -cancer deaths,  
e) any revascularization of an artery,  
f) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47010], hyponatremia, or renal failure,  
g) other hypokalemia (< 3.5 meq/L), hyponatremia (< 130 meq/L),  or renal failure,  
h) new diabetes, requiring medications, defined as first use of medication for diabetes,

VA Central IRB
Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT [ADDRESS_49581] to overall complian ce (adherence) to the randomly 
assigned medication, indirectly measured by [CONTACT_47097] (MPR) and average 
daily dose (ADD).  The comparison will be made using a GEE analysis to account for varying 
periods of follow -up.  The potential per iod ends if the subject dies, has an outcome event, or 
changes medication.  Subjects categorized as medication compliant will make up the per -
protocol subgroup of the study cohort.  
6. Non -acute Outcomes  
The repeated measures of systolic blood pressure during the disease -free intervals (free of 
component events) will be compared by [CONTACT_3148].   We will use a mixed effects repeated 
measures model allowing for irregular time intervals, the spatial power law extension of AR(1) 
covariance option where r(t1,t2) =  𝑟(𝑡1,𝑡2)=exp⁡(|𝑡1−𝑡2|). In each model we will assume 
linear growth over time. A random effect will be included for both intercept and linear time. The 
hypotheses will test if SBP increases/decreases over time for subjects receiving chlorthalidone, if 
SBP increases/decreases over time for subjects receiving hydrochlorothiazide, and if both have 
non-zero slopes, a test of whether they differ or are equal.  
We will conduct a time -to-event analysis comparing treatments for the outcome of time to first 
discontin uation of assigned diuretic (defined as no prescription for ≥ [ADDRESS_49582] 
observation during study period) and time to first protocol deviation from assigned diuretic.  
G. Exploratory Objectives  
1. Per-protocol analysis  
The primary intent to treat analyses of randomly assigned treatments takes no account of post -
baseline changes such as protocol deviations and treatment switches from  chlorthalidone  to  
hydrochlorothiazide (and vice versa). Thus, exploratory analyses will model such changes to 
assess robust ness of conclusions . 
The per -protocol analysis will determine if chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide differ among 
the subset of protocol compliant subjects.  We will run other analyses that include all subjects 
and attempt to model the time -dependent effects of protocol deviations such as medication 
changes and levels of compliance.  Frailty analyses will assess center effects.  We will explore 
censoring patterns  such as models that assume not missing -at-random censoring ( 103). 
A change in medication may alter the subsequent risk of a cardiovascular event.   First, we will 
add time -dependent covariates to a Cox model, such as binary indicators of a switch from 
chlorthalidone to hydrochlorothiazide, switch from hydrochlorothiazide to chlorthalidone, and 
the start of new medication that interacts with chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide.   To 
directly estimate subsequent risk, we will use a multistage model (MSM) t o assess the hazard 
rate of a major cardiovascular event after a switch  (104).  MSM models extend the time -to-first-
event models to second, third, and more events.   This extension of the Cox model allows direct 
estimation of the hazard rate associated wit h any transition adjusted for previous history and

Version 4.5 | 25OCT [ADDRESS_49583] older patients  with pre -existing conditions.  
There is also evidence from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that many patients 
with major medical events are not seeking the care they require during the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 
The DCP patient population is 65 or  older with known baseline cardiovascular diseae, and many 
overweight with diabetes.  With a primary outcome consisting of components that often require 
immediate medical attention, there is a possibility that the observed rate of the study’s primary 
outco me will be impacted by [CONTACT_47098].  We will characterize event rates throughout the 
study  to assess the impact of COVID -19.  We will also assess primary outcome event rates in 
COVID -positive patients and in geographic locations with particularly high rat es of infection.   
H. Randomization  
To control for potential imbalance in randomization, both stratification and blocking will be employed.  
The randomization scheme will be stratified by [CONTACT_47099].  Participants will be randomized to either hydrochlorothiazide or 
chlorthalidone with in blocks of size 6.  
Enrollment and randomization of subjects will occur in accordance with Section IX. Study Procedures  
and Appendix C. Recruitment Flowchar t. 
 
XII. Feasibility and Recruitment Plan 
A.  Feasibility  
In 2012, [ADDRESS_49584] 
2000 patients over age 65 ( Appendix E.1). In VISN1, 80% of these had SBP ≥[ADDRESS_49585] 
measurement with no SBP measurement below 1 20 mm Hg in the previous 90 days  (Appendix E.2). 
Applying these regional SBP data to the national medical center data, in [ADDRESS_49586] been  76 
VA medical centers with ≥1500  eligible patients and 104 cente rs with ≥1000 eligible patients.  
Based on experience with the CONFIRM study (CSP #577) and the Million Veteran Program  and other 
sources , we estimate that: 15% of PCPs will opt out; PCPs who don’t opt out will exclude 5% of their 
patients; 5% of patients mailed the initial letter will opt out; we will reach 65% of patients we attempt to 
call; 60% of those we reach by [CONTACT_47100]; 2% of those who agree by [CONTACT_47101]. Comb ining the se rates: 
(.85)(.95)(.95)(.65)(.6)(.98) = .29, suggesting we should expect to enroll about 30% of eligible patients 
identified.  
 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   38 Based on these considerations, randomization of 13,700 patients (270 per site at 50 sites ) should be 
feasible. We anticipate tha t this process will take [ADDRESS_49587] , the DCP will allow all patients fitting the eligibility criteria to be 
enrolled regardless of how th ey were identified.  
In addition, we will initiate 20% more sites (i.e., 10 additional sites) than what is needed for successful 
enrollment into the study. As sites fail at recruitment or as the potential patient pool decreases at the 
vanguard sites, enrol lment into the DCP will be started at the 10 additional sites.  
XIII. Data C ollectio n and Data Sources   
Data for this study will be obtained from the medical and administrative data that are collected and 
maintained by [CONTACT_47102] (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse 
(CDW).  This database  cover s the entire veteran population that utilizes the VA and contain s individual 
information on demographic factors, medical history, key laboratory values, procedure codes, and 
diagnoses (inpatient  and outpatient) coded with the ICD -9-CM and ICD -[ADDRESS_49588]. Data from the various VA databases  (including COVID -19 data from 
the COVID -19 Shared Data Resource)  will be linked together using a unique veteran identification 
number that is assigned to each veteran at entry into the system.  
Vital status  will be ascertained from the VA Vital Status File . This file allows for complete ascertainment 
of death as it pulls data from multiple sources, including: the Beneficiary Identification and Records 
Locator Subsystem database; the Death Master File from the Social Security Administration; and the 
National  Patient Care Database.  Ascertainment of death with this method has demonstrated 98% 
sensitivity and 98% agreement with the National Death Index.  Cause of death will be collected from the 
National Death Index, as the VA Vital Status File does not aggregat e cause of death across the 
aforementioned data sources.  
We will monitor for discontinuation or expi[INVESTIGATOR_47021] , detection of which  will 
prompt queries  to the PCP asking the reason . No effort will be made by [CONTACT_47103] d 
pressure goals or the prescribing of other drugs.

and Security rules.   Data for this study will be stored in two locations: 1) on a VINCI -hosted server and 2) 
on a [LOCATION_011] CSPCC -hosted server.  [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  personnel man age the data access request process for 
the electronic system s to ensure that data access is appropriate for each individual and the level of the 
individual access.   Study project management will manage the Data Access Request Tracker (DART) 
activities associated with granting VINCI access to study databases.  VA’s O ffice of Information & 
Technology (OI&T) is responsible for managing other VA system access and ensuring the security and 
integrity of VA information systems, including the databases and servers housing study data.   In 
accordance with VA Handbooks and Dire ctives, OI&T is responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
firewalls and data security is implemented and maintained, that data backups are performed and that 
data may be restored in the event of a system malfunction.  
Data security incidents will be reporte d according to 1058.01. All [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  staff will be expected to 
report data security incidents to the responsible authority as they become aware of the breach. 
Whenever possible, the reporting of data security incidents will be handled by [CONTACT_47104] (ACDQA). This will be done to facilitate communication 
between the center and the oversight bodies. In the event that an incident must be reported by a staff 
member other than the ACDQA, all communication after the initial report will be handled by [CONTACT_47105] , the [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  ACDPOC,  or the [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  ACDQA. [Note: all new and 
current [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  personnel will be trained on reporting data security incidents.]   
All local data secu rity incidents will be reported in accordance with VA policy within one hour of 
discovering the incident to:  
1. The [LOCATION_011] Information Security Officer (ISO)  
2. The [LOCATION_011] Privacy Officer (PO)  
3. The [LOCATION_011] ACOS for Research

Study data will be coded and stored using a unique study identifier for each participant. Identifiable 
information will be collected for patient tracking and safety purposes, and kept in an encrypted, 
password protected file to which a small number of people will have acc ess. Access to the cross -walk file 
linking the participant's identifiers and their study data will be restricted to the approved personnel at

of Behavior, and Good Clinical Practices). Once formal training is completed, user accounts  for a study -
specific web application  utilizing a URL specific to the study to access and use the system and enter 
patient data will be activated  for project management, study nursing staff, and call center staff . 
Accounts will be password protected and unique to  each  user. The account permissions will correspond 
with the users' functional study group.  Furthermore, the permissions of the electronic systems are 
heavily restricted . The  site L iaisons will not have access to study data . Only properly approved 
Coordin ating Center personnel will have the ability to copy and export data. These individuals have 
received training on the local standard operating procedure ( SOP) governing their permissions. Access to 
protected health information (PHI) will be restricted to i ndividuals approved by [CONTACT_47107] , including the study’s mailing vendor . 
At the [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  the following  staff will have access to all forms of PHI:  
1. Center Director

Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   41 At the end of the study, the data for DCP will remain property of the Cooperative Studies Program and 
be stored and shared according to CSP guidelines and procedures.  Retention and destruction of data will 
be conducted according to  CSP operating procedures and federal and local VA regulations. This will 
include electronic data stored at the [LOCATION_011] CSPCC , and at the VA facility housing our servers. 
Identifiable data will be kept according to CSP policy as outlined in the "CSP Guideli nes for the Planning 
and Conduct of Cooperative Studies” . 
XV. Human Subjects  
A. Waiver of HIPAA authorization  
A waiver of HIPAA authorization to use VA data to determine eligibility will be  requested because the 
research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of this information.  In order to 
conduct the study, it is necessary to first be able to identify eligible patients so that the recruitment  
letter can be mailed to  them.  
We will also request IRB approval for a waiver of HIPAA authorization to collect data prospectively. 
Unlike traditional randomized clinical trials, a feature of the POC methodology is that data collection is 
performed by [CONTACT_47109]. All da ta elements will be collected electronically from EHR/VISTA 
using both the Veteran’s Information and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), a collaborative effort 
between the VA Office of Information Technology and the VA Office of Research and Development, and  
the Office of Information Technology’s Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). Healthcare encounters 
outside of the VA will be captured using Medicare data. Data from the various VA databases will be 
linked together and maintained using a unique veteran identific ation number (not SSN).  Access to the 
cross -walk file linking the participant’s identifiers and their study data will be restricted to approved 
personnel at the CSP coordinating center.  
Because data abstraction is done electronically and not by [CONTACT_47110] a waiver of HIPAA authorization is justified and involves no more than minimal risk to 
the privacy of individuals. All protected health information, except participant address  and treatment 
assignment , will remain within the VA. The information will only be shared with the mailing contractor 
using secure methods in alignment with VA policies . Moreover, it would be impractical to obtain a 
signed authorization from patients in this study for use of their heal th information. The PCP’s cannot 
obtain a written HIPAA authorization for research purposes from patients who are subjects in this study 
because they will not see the patient until weeks or months after the patient has been on the 
randomized treatment.   The PCPs are not study team members.  We plan to identify and disclose to 
participants in our information statement the health information to be collected and the specific 
databases from which it will be obtained.  
In both instances, the patient eligibility screening and the prospective collection of patient data, t he use 
of the requested information involves no more than minimal risk to the privacy of individuals based on 
the security measures used by [CONTACT_47111] f rom improper use and 
disclosure , and to destroy the identifiers at the earliest opportunity consisten t with conduct of the 
research . The requested information will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, 
 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT [ADDRESS_49591] long been available as 
generics, and are included in the VA national formulary in the same drug class: USP code CV 701, 
thiazide -type diuretics. The VA frequently selects one member of such a class to make available “on 
formulary” based on cost or other considerations, and VA Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees will 
direct VA pharmacies to substitute drugs  within a class when one drug becomes unavailable, so it is not 
uncommon that VA physicians and patients have limited choice within a class.  
While thiazide -type diuretics affect some blood chemical levels as discussed above, these effects have 
not demonstr ated adverse  clinical  impact that would affect their being the preferred treatment for 
hypertension. Furthermore, our plan to substitute an equivalent dose of chlorthalidone for the current 
dose of hydrochlorothiazide, i.e. half the number of milligrams, w ould be expected to have an effect on 
blood pressure and on blood chemical levels , small enough to be virtually indistinguishable from the 
variation in these parameters that would ensue with remaining on the prescribed hydrochlorothiazide  
(see Background a nd Rationale, parts F and I) . We therefore propose that the study intervention 
qualifies as minimal  risk. Because the two drugs are used interchangeably, and the choice between them 
is not influenced by [CONTACT_47112], but only by [CONTACT_47113] , randomization does not 
reduce individualization of patient care. Care remains personalized after randomization because the PCP 
manages the diuretic as usual. The patient’s needs are thus not subordinated to the needs of the trial. 
Furthermore, b ecause hy pertension is a chronic condition, randomized patients will themselves be 
among those expected to benefit from the information gained from this study.  
 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   43 In their article “Randomized, controlled trials as minimal risk: an ethica l analysis”, Morris and Nelson 
(106) conclude that “A randomized, controlled trial poses no more than minimal risk only when all of the 
following five criteria are met: 1) genuine clinical equipoise exists; 2) all of the treatment options 
included in the research study fall within the c urrent standard of care; 3) there is no currently available 
treatment with a more favorable risk -benefit profile than the treatments included in the research study; 
4) the nontherapeutic components of the research are safely under the minimal risk threshol d; and 5) 
the research protocol provides sufficient latitude for treating physicians to individualize care when 
appropriate.” We have designed this study to meet all of these criteria.  
We believe that the Waiver of Documentation of Informed Consent that we  are requesting is necessary 
to the successful completion of our study because obtaining the required sample size within the VA is 
only feasible if recruitment is maximally efficient, as described in the Feasibility section (XII.A). Published 
evidence demo nstrates that requiring that written consent be returned by [CONTACT_47114]  (107-111). If requirement of returned 
written consent caused loss of  most willing patients  from our stu dy, it is unlikely that it could be 
completed within the VA system.  
Based on these considerations, we will request  IRB approval of a Waiver of Documentation of Informed 
Consent. Under the terms we are requesting for the Waiver, patients would be recruited  by [CONTACT_2319], and 
the elements of  consent  obtained  over the phone, a written summary of the consent will be sent to the 
patient, but a signed returned document would not be required .  
Enrolled patients will be given study contact [CONTACT_47115] w ithdrawal.  
C. Engagement in Research  
For this study, we consider  the Site Liaison and the PCP’s to be  not engaged in research. The Site Liaison 
(sometimes called a “Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]” in other studies) serves to provide information to local site personnel 
about the s tudy and relays information and questions back to the coordinating center, but in our view 
takes no action that qualifies as research. The PCPs facilitate implementation of the intervention ( after  
patients provide consent  and are randomized by  [CONTACT_47116]) by [CONTACT_47117]. The PCPs are themselves research subjects in whom we are studying the 
implementation of the protocol.  
XVI. Quality Control Procedures  
Data that is extracted for the DCP will be cleaned and managed accord ing to a rigorous data 
management plan that will be written in conjunction with the statistical analysis plan and the study 
operations manual (for chairs office and CSPCC personnel).  However, the data will also be subject to 
quality control procedures.  A s a first line effort to ensure the validity of the data, 100% of the data 
elements collected from the first [ADDRESS_49592] to source 
verification and validation through chart review that will be done by [CONTACT_47118] . In addition, chart review done through the creation of the algorithms to 
identify outcomes for the DCP will also be used to perform QC procedures on the data.  In brief, a 
 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   44 sample of the data will be verified periodically by [CONTACT_47119] . If 
errors are identified they will be referred to the data management teams at the [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  or at 
VINCI for resolution.  
In addition, the quality management system  (QMS)  in place at the CSPCC will ensure further quality 
control for t he DCP. The Quality Assurance Department of the CSPCC will subject the study  to risk based 
audits according to internal SOPs for conducting risk based monitoring and auditing.    These audits will 
evaluate the studys’ compliance with QMS  processes and proc edures. If deviations or non -
conformances are identified they will be remedied through the internal corrective action/preventive 
action system  of the QMS . 
 
XVII. Study Monitoring Plan  
A. Introduction  
The safety issues related to hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalido ne are well established in the medical 
literature and both diuretics are accepted first -line treatments for hypertension. Based on this 
information the study poses minimal risks to participants beyond the expected adverse events (AE) 
associated with the ad ministration of either drug as part of “usual” care.  
Monitoring side effects and adverse events in the traditional manner of usual clinical trials is not feasible 
for Point of Care studies since there are no site personnel and all data is captured passively through the 
EMR.  In addition, real -time monitoring  will neither provide new information regarding the safety of 
these two treatments nor assure  adequate (or timely) safety of human subjects beyond that already 
done by [CONTACT_47120].  Accordingly, we propose an alternati ve safety 
reporting plan for the DCP study that ensures protection of the participants and that complies with VHA 
Policy (i.e., VHA Handbooks 1200.05 and 1058.01).  In brief, health providers will identify, monitor, and 
treat (as necessary) adverse events t hat occur during the course of the study. The CSPCC will identify 
expected adverse events  (as described below)  through the EMR and report them to the monitoring 
committees for the trial. The sections that follow describe in more detail the proposed  safety  monitoring 
and reporting plan for this trial.   
B. Safety Monitoring Plan  
The participant’s physicians, nurses, and other health providers will continue their usual monitoring of 
the subject throughout the course of his/her treatment. If any treatments are i ndicated, they will be 
provided by [CONTACT_47121] a part of the participant’s routine medical care. The CSPCC staff will 
collect safety data from the medical record from the time of consent through the end of the study  
period .  The safety data will th en be aggregated and classified according to ICD -10 codes.  
Aggregated safety data will be reported to the Data Monitoring Committee, the study Executive 
Committee, and the VA Central IRB using the processes described in Section C. Please refer to Section

C. Safety Reporting  
1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected using the 21 CFR 312.32, International Conference on Harmonisation 
(ICH) for Clinical Safety Data Management (ICH -E2A), and CSP Global SOP 3.6 definitions.  Adverse 
events (AEs) are defined by [CONTACT_941] 21 CFR 312.32 as "any untoward medical occurrence associated with the  
use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related."  
According to ICH -E2A,”an AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study interv entions.”  
Expected adverse events of interest related to diuretics will be culled from the EMR as part of the 
outcome ascertainment activities of this protocol . The expected AEs of interest  will be:  
1. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47010], hyp onatremia, or renal failure  
2. Renal failure (dialysis or renal transplant)  
3. Other recorded hypokalemia (< 3.1 mEq/L), or hyponatremia (< 130 mEq/L)  
4. New diabetes, defined as first use of an outpatient medication for diabetes  
5. Acute gout epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]   
6. New allergic  reaction to thiazide -type diuretic  to be found in EMR allergy data  
These safety events are monitored and treated as part of routine medical care. These events will be 
identified by [CONTACT_47122] (EMR).  Informatics staff at the [LOCATION_011] 
CSPCC  will extract medical record data on all subjects and identify adverse events through ICD -[ADDRESS_49594] reporting on additional safety data not 
specified above, as relevant to the study.  Data will be in the form of  aggregated data tables detailing 
the frequencies of these events by [CONTACT_47123].  These events will be repor ted to the 
Central IRB in blinded aggregate form at the time of continuing review.  
Adverse events which develop into Serious Adverse Events, as defined below, will be reported as such.  
2. Expected Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) are a sub set of adverse events defined in 21 CFR 312.32(a) and VA 
Handbook 1058.01 paragraph 4(w) , as follows:  
 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   46 Definition of SAE from CFR 312.32 (a):  Serious adverse event. An adverse event or suspected adverse 
reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of ei ther the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of 
the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical 
events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47022], based upon appropriate medical jud gment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Definition of SAE according to VA Handbook 1058.01: An SAE is an AE in human research that results  in 
death, a life -threatening experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], persistent 
or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly, or birth defect. An AE is also considered 
serious when medical, surgical, behavior al, social, or other intervention is needed to prevent such an 
outcome.  
The intervention in this study is the switch from hydrochlorothiazide to an equivalent dose of 
chlorthalidone, two widely -used diuretics with well -known risk profiles.  There are no sa fety events that 
are unanticipated in regard to these two drugs.  Thus, serious adverse events defined above that are 
feasibly identified through the medical record will be reported in aggregate to the DMC at [ADDRESS_49595] udy chairmen and DMC.  
This study will not use MedDRA coding of AE and SAE data.  The study team will define events using the 
data sources described above and categorize events by [CONTACT_9313] , major diagnostic category,  or 
assessment type for reporti ng. 
3. Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects and Others  
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others (UPRs), but not qualifying as a serious 
adverse event by [CONTACT_108] (such as errant distribution of study medication), will also be reported. 
Unanticipated problems related to the study desig n will be reported to the IRB in an expedited fashion 
(within 5 business days of identifying the problem).  Possible events include failure to distribute study 
drug, patient continuing previous prescription while taking study drug, or patient randomized wi thout 
provider knowledge.  Informatics staff at the [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  will extract medical record data on all 
subjects regularly allowing for the identification of UPRs at fixed intervals.  Study reports will be 
circulated to appropriate members, including the study chairmen.  
UPRs that result in an SAE, pursuant to the definition above, will be reported as an SAE to the VA Central 
IRB within 5 business days by [CONTACT_47124].  
XVIII.  Study Organization and Administra tion  
 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   47 A. Administration  
The administrative structure of this study is similar to others in CSP and includes:  
The Cooperative Studies Program (VA Central Office) establishes overall policies and procedures that are 
applied to all VA cooperative studies through  the Study Chair’s office and the CSPCC.  
The CSPCC and the Study Chair’s office jointly will perform the day -to-day scientific and administrative 
coordination of the study. These include developi[INVESTIGATOR_47023]; abstracting data 
from the  national databases (CSPCC Only); ensuring the appropriate support for the participating 
centers; scheduling meetings and conference calls; answering questions about the protocol. The CSPCC 
will also prepare interim and final progress reports; and archive study data at the end of the study. 
Study progress reports will be produced every 6 months. Patient accrual, patient safety, and data quality 
will be monitored closely by [CONTACT_47125], the study executive committee, and the DMC to ensure that the 
study is pro gressing satisfactorily. Further delineation of responsibilities will be documented in 
communications with the Study Chair’s office.  
The CSPCC will be responsible for monitoring and reporting the safety of trial participants through the 
review, assessment,  and communication of adverse events and serious adverse events detected within 
the national data systems.  The CSPCC will document trends and analyze safety data to prepare reports 
for various committees including the DMC, VA Central IRB (CIRB), Executive  Committee(s), and Study 
Group meetings.  
The CSPCC will work closely with the Minneapolis VAMC  to track eligible participants  as they move 
through the recruitment and enrollment workflow.  The primary responsibilities for the call ers include 
contact[CONTACT_47126].  
The external mailing contractor will be  primarily  responsible  for sending study communications  to 
providers and patients. The mailing contractor will be sent  regular mailing files compi[INVESTIGATOR_47024], address, and specific correspondence to be sent. PHI will 
be sent to the mailing contractor using secure methods in alignment with VA policies .  
The CSP Clinical Research  Pharmacy Coordinating Center (CSPCRPCC) will provide advice and 
consultation about drug -related matters, review safety information, and serve  as a regulatory affairs 
expert and  liaison to the FDA for regulatory matters.  
 The Clinical Sciences Scientific Evaluation Committee (CSSEC) reviews the scientific merit of all new 
cooperative study proposals and all ongoing cooperative studies. The committee is composed of both 
VA and non -VA clinical research scientists, most of whom have had experience in managing their own 
cooperative studies.  
B. Monitoring  
 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT [ADDRESS_49596] manager, CSP Center Director, selected VA experts , and 
outside consultants as needed. This committee will meet regularly to review blinded data (not broken 
down by [CONTACT_1570]), decide upon changes in the study, determine the fate of hosp itals whose 
performance is substandard, initiate any subprotocols, and discuss publication of the study results.  This 
Committee must grant permission before any study data may be used for presentation or publication.  
The Technical Committee will advise th e Executive Committee on informatics and database related 
issues pertaining to study operations.  This committee will serve as subject matter experts  (SMEs)  for 
the study database, web application, ETL procedures and primary data source, the Corporate Data  
Warehouse. It will consist of a VINCI representative, [LOCATION_011] CSPCC  Director of Informatics, and other 
informaticians/SMEs  as needed.  
The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the progress of the study and will monitor patient 
intake, outcomes, adver se events, and other issues related to patient safety. Interim, independent, and 
unbiased reviews of the study's ongoing progress will be provided. The DMC will consist of experts in the 
study’s subject matter field(s), clinical trials, biostatistics, and ethics. These individuals will not be 
participants in the trial and will not have participated in the planning of the protocol. The DMC will 
consider safety or other circumstances as grounds for early termination, including either compelling 
internal or ex ternal evidence of treatment differences or the unfeasibility of addressing the study 
hypothesis (e.g., poor patient intake, poor adherence to the protocol).  
At each of its meetings during the study period, the DMC will review the randomization rates and assess 
the difference between the actual and the projected rates, as well as the impact of these assessments 
on overall trial size. If the study enrollment is inadequate, the reasons for exclusion may be scrutinized 
and actions may be suggested. An assessm ent of whether the trial should be continued will be made 
followed by [CONTACT_47127], as appropriate. All serious adverse events will be reported regularly to 
the DMC for review. Unexpected, related serious adverse events will be reported to the DMC as so on as 
they become known based upon the consensus of the Study Chair, the study bios tatistician, the Study 
Director . The study biostatistician will provide the appropriate data to the DMC at specified intervals for 
this purpose. Conditional power estimates may be provided to the DMC to assist them in making their 
decisions and recommendations at their request. To help them make their assessment, the Study Chair 
and study biostatistician will furnish the Data Monitoring Committee with appropriate monitoring d ata 
before each meeting.  The DMC makes recommendations after each meeting to the Director of the 
Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) Service about whether the study should continue or be stopped.  
The VA Central IRB will be the IRB of record for all VA sites .  They will monitor the study’s serious 
adverse events on a continual basis.  They will conduct annual reviews of the study.  In addition, some 
 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: October 26, 2022
Version 4.5 | 25OCT 2022                   49 study materials (such as subject correspondence and protocol changes) will have to be reviewed by [CONTACT_47128], and approved prior to implementation.  
The CSPCC Human Rights Committee (HRC) is composed primarily of lay people and is responsible for 
ensuring that patients' rights and safety are upheld prior to study initiation and during the conduct of 
the study. The  committee reviews all new protocols, periodically makes site visits to participating 
centers to monitor firsthand the progress of the study, and may be asked to review any ethical and 
human rights issues that arise dur ing the conduct of the study.   
XIX. Public ations  
A. Publication policy  
It is the policy of the CSP that outcome data will not be revealed to the participating investigators until 
the data collection phase of the study is completed. This policy safeguards against possible biases 
affecting the data col lection. All presentations and publications from this study will be done in 
accordance with current CSP Guidelines, including the Authorship Policy. The most current version of 
the Guidelines should be referenced when planning any study publication.  
The pr esentation or publication of any or all data collected by [CONTACT_47129]'s Executive Committee. 
No individual participating investigator has any inheren t right to perform analyses or interpretations or 
to make public presentations or seek publication of any or all of the data other than under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_47025].  
The Executive Committee has the authority to establish one or more publication subgroups of   
investigators and members of the Executive Committee for producing scientific presentations and 
publications. Authors with VA appointments must list their VA affi liation first. The VA contributions to 
the research project should be acknowledged in all written and oral presentations of the research 
results, including scientific articles, news releases, news conferences, public lectures, and media 
interviews.   
All study reports and journal manuscripts must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_47130].  After approval for submission is granted by [CONTACT_47131], VA Central Office must be notified upon acceptance of any publications.  This includes minor 
publications such as abstracts and poster presentations.   
B.  Planned Publications  
A list of planned publications is below:

VIII. Main outcomes paper  
IX. Blood pressure control and drug compliance in the DCP  
X. Blood chemistries in the DCP  
XX. Provider Experience Survey  
In order to improve the design of future point -of-care trials , a surve y was designed to query  providers 
that consent ed to participate  in the CSP 597 study  about their experience with the study  (Appendix 21).  
The questions were designed to assess if education about the study was adequate and delivered in a 
convenient format,  how interested providers are in the study question, time burden of study 
participation, and level of comfort with a pragmatic trial design .  Demographic information is also 
requested.  Survey results will be captured in a VA approved platform. .  Completio n of the survey is 
voluntary.  The study will be reviewed by [CONTACT_47132] (OAC) 
before being distributed to consented CSP 597 providers.  Provider survey results will be made available 
through clinicaltrials.gov. Qualita tive analysis will be performed for open text responses and sub -
questions.  Dichotomous responses and survey responses on a Likert scale will be analyzed using 
quantitative methods.     
An additional interview will be made available to consented providers at Minneapolis VAHCS  (Appendix 
25). This interview will  take place in person or via teleconference. Interview questions will  focus on the 
providers individual experience throughout DCP and allow providers to give less structured feedback on 
the consent and  randomization workflows. The aim is to further help structure future POC studies. All 
results will  de-identified and  made available on clinicaltrials.gov

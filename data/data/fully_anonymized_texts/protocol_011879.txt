The objective of this proposal is to gather pi[INVESTIGATOR_49452] a pending NIH R01 submission that will seek to reduce this cancer treatment related CV morbidity by [CONTACT_371321] a pre-chemotherapy, patient-centered, tailored physical activity intervention (PAI) designed to prevent declines in exercise capacity, cardiovascular performance, cognitive function, and quality of life in patients receiving Anth-bC and other potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_371286]. The novel features of this proposal include:  1) Initiation of the intervention before and/or during receipt of chemotherapy, leveraging results from animal experiments suggesting this strategy reduces Anth-bC related cardiac injury;  2) Incorporation of three modalities of exercise/activity based training: a) tailored progressive activity, b) strength training, and c) home-based activities suited to one’s individual lifestyle, each facilitated and reinforced objectively using activity tracking; 3) Use of a newly developed magnetic resonance cardiopulmonary exercise treadmill test to assess, for the first time, near simultaneously and with high accuracy, the factors [e.g., cardiac output (stroke volume x heart rate)] that contribute to peak VO2, the gold standard, objective measure of exercise capacity. This new information will provide mechanistic insight into how a tailored exercise-based physical activity intervention helps preserve exercise capacity and reduces fatigue; and 4) Measurement of cognitive function, thereby [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_371287]-bC or other potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_371288] I-IV breast cancer.

This study will test the potential for a novel (lifestyle) intervention designed to improve exercise capacity, HRQOL and cardiac and cognitive dysfunction.

Routine exercise enhances both physical and mental HRQOL in survivors of lymphoma.6-8  • Cognitive impairment occurs after receipt of Anth-bC for NHL. Breast cancer recipi[INVESTIGATOR_371293]. 9     In cancer survivors, exercise capacity – a modifiable characteristic that is strongly associated with risk of CV events – is reduced after Anth-bC or other potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_371294], and is associated with improved QOL and cognitive function. • Survey data suggest that more physical activity after lymphoma is associated with decreased CV events.10  • In 122 participants who completed treatment for non- or Hodgkin lymphoma, 12 weeks of supervised exercise training improved peak VO2 relative to those provided written materials (p<0.001). Improved peak VO2 correlated with improved physical function (p=0.026). 6 • In meta-analyses of >3,000 individuals with chronic diseases (including 480 subjects with cancer), low to high intensity exercise interventions were associated with enhanced cognitive function, independent of the disease process, or the type, frequency or intensity of the exercise regimen). 11  Proof-of-concept trials reported improved cognitive function (p<0.01) after exercise in breast cancer survivors treated with Anth-bC  • Among [ADDRESS_464395] cancer survivors, aged 58±10 years, 6-month individualized exercise interventions (2 to 3 60-minute moderate intensity epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]/week) resulted in a 20% improvement in peak VO2, (p=0.04) and a 35% to 50% reduction in behaviorally related fatigue (p=0.001) on the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_371295].12  In NHL patients, the feasibility, timing of initiation, mechanism of benefit, and overall utility of a tailored/progressive physical activity intervention for

They are however very interested in a program that encourages activity, is tailored to their capabilities, and initiates early during their cancer treatment.14   • Interestingly, in 20 individuals randomized to 12 weeks of 3 individualized/tailored bicycle exercise, varying from 60% to 100% of maximum exercise capacity, peak VO2 increased by 2.6+3.7 ml/min/kg, versus a 1.5+2.2 ml/min/Kg decline in those not exercising.15 • In male Sprague-Dawley rats, 10 weeks of exercise preconditioning on motorized treadmills or voluntary running wheels attenuated LV dysfunction 5 and 10 days after doxorubicin treatment; when continued through chronic administration of doxorubicin, it prevented 4-week post-treatment-related declines in LV performance.2-[ADDRESS_464397] cardiac dysfunction.1  • How tailored exercise training preserves exercise capacity – via preservation of cardiac function and/or peripheral A-VO2 difference,– is unknown.  As shown in Figure 1, exercise capacity is related to two components; [ADDRESS_464398] focused on the adverse effects of Anth-bC on LV stroke volume (a contributor to exercise- associated cardiac output).  However, postmenopausal women before, during, and after treatment for breast cancer had decreased peak VO2 but not necessarily a marked decrease in exercise-associated cardiac output.[ADDRESS_464399] Cancer Patients Undergoing Treatment – An addendum to NIH R01CA167821 “Early Imaging Detection of CV Injury after Cancer” Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center CCCWFU# [ZIP_CODE]

(Figure 2). This study would be significant because it addresses several important premises: 1) Exercise intolerance and LV dysfunction are important causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with NHL who receive Anth-bC.1-3 2) Animal data suggest that exercise before anthracyclines reduces LV dysfunction 18-20 If this premise were true in human subjects, patients with NHL may be directed to purposely avoid sedentary behavior during receipt of Anth-bC – a true paradigm shift in the management of these individuals.  3) The benefits of activity-based interventions on exercise capacity may extend beyond the heart. 17  Existing surveillance recommendations to prevent CV events focus primarily on serial measures of “cardiotoxicity”, including LV ejection fraction, and global longitudinal strain.  These strategies miss the potential adverse effects of Anth-bC on peripheral arterial and skeletal muscle function. Importantly, this study will evaluate the differential effects of Anth-bC or other potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_371299]2. 4) Activity based interventions may improve cognitive function in conjunction with increases in exercise capacity during cancer treatment. 7 5) NHLBI and NCI mandates: a) the NHLBI goal to improve understanding of clinical mechanisms of CV disease and thereby [CONTACT_371322], diagnosis and treatment;21 and b) the NCI’s commitment to determine actionable strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer.[ADDRESS_464401] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_371300] a proposal.

Combining advanced MRI measures with the exercise variables will provide mechanistic insights into how increasing activity affects the heart versus peripheral factors associated with arteriovenous O2 differences, impacting exercise capacity in lymphoma patients. • This is the first study to test whether initiating exercise-based physical activity before and/or during Anth-bC therapy or other potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_371302]/or preserve LV function in NHL patients.

The exercise intervention component of our PAI will be initiated at the Health and Exercise Science Clinical Research Center near the Reynolda Campus of Wake Forest University, Wake Forest Baptist Health Sticht Center or in Cardiac Rehabilitation Facilities and under the direct supervision of a master’s level clinical exercise physiologist. Three center-based PAI sessions will be offered each week (M,W,F). They will have the ability to participate in one to two training sessions per week at one of these centers and 1-2 sessions per week at home (the 4th level of our multi-level intervention). Each PAI session will consist of a slow (15min) aerobic warm-up; followed by 20 minutes of strength training; 15 minutes of progressive intensity aerobic exercise (AE); and 10 minutes of cool-down by [CONTACT_371325]/toning with elastic bands similar to those recommended by [CONTACT_9422] (Figure 7).[ADDRESS_464408] will work with participants to create an exercise session and find creative ways to complete different types of exercises. Exercises could include, but are not limited to, over ground walking, body weight exercises, or use of resistance bands. The mode of activity for the center-based AE sessions will be over-ground walking and/or stationary cycling that is prescribed based on the “non-linear approach” described by [CONTACT_371326].34,35 This approach adheres to the principle of progressive intensity and is designed to increase exercise capacity outcomes (peak VO2 peak and 6min walk distance), yet also permit individual “tailoring” based on each participant’s daily perceived level of fatigue and disease/treatment related symptoms. Specifically, in “non-linear” prescriptions,

Protocol version date 11/12/2021    Page 14 of 114         the AE sessions are sequenced such that the physiological “stimulus” is progressively modified with regard to the intensity and duration and in conjunction with appropriate rest and recovery sessions in order to optimize physiological adaptations. The goal for the moderate – 45-60 minute AE sessions per week is to progress the intensity from 50% to 75% of VO2peak by [CONTACT_2671] 6 month progressive tailored intervention.36 Strength training will initiate at similar thresholds for core and peripheral skeletal muscles in that 50% of maximal resistance exercises at 5-8 repetitions per muscle group will occur at the initial visits and then progress to 70% of maximum resistance with the same number of repetitions toward the 6 month completion of the study. The CPET will be re-assessed after 3 months of treatment to re-calculate the AE intensity level to ensure continual increase in the physiological stimulus. During AE sessions, intensity and safety will be stressed and when at the cardiac rehabilitation facilities be continuously assessed via heart rate while blood pressure at the beginning, middle, and end of each session. Participants will be encouraged to accumulate 150 minutes (~30 minutes day) of light-moderate intensity PA per week outside the program facility. Daily and weekly targets for PA will be self-monitored by [CONTACT_371327]-worn Fitbit and Actigraph activity monitors. Increasing lifestyle physical activity is an important supplement to the 1-2 day/wk center-based AE and provides flexibility to the participant’s schedule and disease/treatment related side effects. [ADDRESS_464409] will take time to communicate with participants during the center-based AE sessions to determine whether PA prescriptions are appropriate, to ask how participants are feeling, and to answer questions regarding the PA prescription.  Adherence, Retention & Barriers to Patient PAI.  All interventionists will receive training and ongoing supervision from [CONTACT_371361] in validated behavioral techniques developed from social cognitive theory (SCT) to enhance intervention adherence.  SCT provides a strong conceptual framework for understanding the pathway from physical activity to health outcomes, with self-efficacy identified as a consistent outcome of physical activity with strong potential for modification. Techniques include frequent contact [CONTACT_371328]; positive feedback; incentives to reach attendance and performance goals; establishing personal commitment to the project; promoting a sense of community via study logo and incentives; and targeted mechanisms for behavioral adherence, including self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and self-regulatory skills. From the outset, the importance of regular attendance will be emphasized. Adherence data will be reviewed regularly to identify any

Protocol version date 11/12/2021    Page 15 of 114         participants who need additional reminders and/or counseling, and gain insight to difficulty with participation in PAI. Interventionists first meet with each participant to discuss expectations and negotiate participant goals. Interventionists then use a flexible “toolbox” approach to tailor interventions to each participant’s needs. Using a social problem-solving framework, a problem is identified (e.g., fatigue), and a solution is found (e.g., negotiate alternate time when energy is higher) and tested for a specific period of time (e.g., 2 sessions). Participants have input on options that are selected. If the solution effectively resolves the problem, the strategy is continued until consistent behavior change is observed. If the solution is unsuccessful, a new option for solving the problem is selected (e.g., decrease intensity of physical movements) and tested. Collectively, these strategies will increase social cognitive mechanisms for regular participation and enhanced adherence in both groups. Our team has had remarkable success with this approach, exceeding study goals for adherence and retention in several federally-funded trials of physical movement-based interventions in adults with chronic disease, e.g., cancer.   Healthy Living Control Group (Arm 2)  Those participants randomized to the control arm will come to a centralized meeting location or receive an invitation for an online meeting to participate in organized health workshops. Each session will last 60 minutes and match the number of visits to the rehab centers for the PAI in a 1:1 fashion with 2 sessions offered per month on Reynolda Campus and remaining sessions over the telephone over the 6 months. (Table 4). Make up sessions either in person or over the telephone will be offered for those participants who have to miss a group session. It is the objective of this HLI intervention to match participant contact [CONTACT_371329].   Session Content: Introduction and Review past material (10 mins); Interactive Healthy Living Presentation (30 mins); Short instructor-led program of upper body stretching exercises (10 mins); Wrap-Up & discussion of next Workshop (10 mins). The topic list is shown Table 5. The purpose of the “Healthy Living” study arm is to control for attention from study staff and social interaction in the intervention group. The design of the control group was informed by [CONTACT_371330]; 1) to positively impact recruitment, participant interest in participation, and on-going adherence to the healthy living arm of study; 2) to have a comparison group that does not directly influence the primary outcome; and 3) to provide a program that would offer benefit to the study participant. There is no evidence to suggest that health education alone will impact physical activity participation or exercise capacity. In addition, the decision to use a once

All images will be acquired using the Siemens 1.5 Tesla Avanto scanner located in the Cardiovascular Imaging Center (Reynolds Tower, Wake Forest Health Sciences, Winston-Salem, North Carolina).   The CMR protocol is performed according to prior techniques48-50 & includes a series of white blood steady-state free precession cine images acquired in the short-axis plane to cover the entire left ventricle (LV) using a 5 to 10 second real-time, cardiac-gated, free breathing acquisitions with the following parameters: 6-10 slices of 8 mm thickness and 2 mm gap spanning the entire LV, a 128x72 matrix, a 340 x 255 mm field of view, 72 views per segment with view sharing, and echo spacing of 2.1 ms, resulting in a temporal resolution of 46 ms and voxel size of 2.6 x 2.6 x 8 mm.  From these images, LV end-diastolic (LVEDV) and end-systolic (LVESV) volumes will be determined for calculation of the LV ejection fraction and stroke volume. Identical sets of volumetric images were acquired pre-exercise and post-exercise (<[ADDRESS_464416]).  All images will be processed offline by [CONTACT_371333] (Leiden, Netherlands). For each slice of the cine stack obtained, pre- and post-exercise, the endocardial border of the myocardium will be contoured to determine the area of the LV blood pool at both end-systole

Using Simpson’s rule, the areas will then be summed together and multiplied by [CONTACT_371334].[ADDRESS_464417]’s body surface area and expressed as mL/m2 or L/min/m2. Brachial artery blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) will be recorded during volumetric image acquisition. Cardiac output will be calculated from the LV stroke volume multiplied by [CONTACT_371335]. For quality control, A complete double reading on 15% of the CMR cases will be performed for quality control purposes. The reader variability results will be reported at 3-month intervals or if a change in personnel could affect image analysis and interpretation. Any scans with irregularities will be subjected to expert review. Like other studies conducted over the past 7 years, these images will also be used for data interpretation and for education purposes.   Maximal (peak VO2) and (6-minute walk) exercise capacity outcomes. In this study, measures of both maximal (peak V02)22,33,34,52-56 and sub-maximal (6-minute walk) exercise capacity will be obtained. Peak V02 is selected as the primary outcome measure because it is the most reproducible measures of exercise capacity and integrates the physiologic response to exercise. 22,33,34,52-56.

Heart rate will be determined from the ECG tracings.  Fatigue and health-related quality of life questionnaires. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Fatigue scale (FACT-fatigue) will be used to assess fatigue.[ADDRESS_464423]-fatigue scale is 13-item scale that has been widely used in many studies to assess cancer related fatigue. The 42-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Lymphoma (FACT-Lym) and the 37-item FACT-B questionnaires will be used to assess disease-specific HRQOL. The FACT-Lym and FACT-B measures are composed of the FACT-General which assesses four primary HRQOL domains: physical well-being (PWB), social well-being (SWB), and emotional well-being (EWB); and an additional sub-scale that measures patient concerns related to lymphoma or breast cancer (e.g., pain, fever, swelling, fatigue, and loss of appetite).

Based on studies of chemotherapy and cognition, cardio-function and cognition and statin therapy and cognition, we propose a battery of validated neurocognitive measures (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Digit Span-Backward, Controlled Oral Word Association and Trail Making Test).  These tests will evaluate verbal memory, attention/concentration, working memory, language, psychomotor speed, processing speed, and executive functions, according to standardized procedures utilized currently in multiple studies by [CONTACT_371336], PhD, including one with [CONTACT_371362] (RO1HL118740). Additionally, key patient reported outcomes (cognitive symptoms, fatigue, mood, pain, social and physical functioning and sleep) will be assessed. Following standardized procedures used in other studies by [CONTACT_120852], staff will be trained in the administration of all questionnaires. Each questionnaire will be self-administered and then reviewed by a study interviewer for completeness before being uploaded into the Oncore database.   A study team member will be trained to administer and scoring of all cognitive tests following standardized procedures used in other studies of cognition and cancer conducted by [CONTACT_371337].  Participants will be given the option to complete these questionnaires electronically at their convenience prior to their research visits using a link to the secure web application REDCap.    Alternatively, if in person testing is either restricted or participants prefer, we would like to be able to carry out a limited battery of physical tests that can be safely completed in the home. In addition to the self-reported data that will be collected via REDCap (as per protocol) we are planning to send a sanitized container with the following contents (see Appendix P): 1. Detailed instruction packet for completing the test battery, including: a. Balance test b. Grip strength test c. 6-minute walk test d. Chair stand test 2. A smartphone that is not connected to the internet or cellular service, but which contains software for administering a balance assessment. 3. A grip strength dynamometer for measuring upper body strength 4. The previously approved Actigraph device for assessing physical activity patterns over a 7-10-day period.

Protocol version date 11/12/[ADDRESS_464426] received the box containing the equipment for completing a short battery of tests designed to measure some of the outcomes in the original procedures, we will identify a time for them to complete the tests. During the initial exercise testing and program initiation (home or supervised) we will teach participants how to use rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and how it relates to intensity (heart rate response, dyspnea). Given the focus on home-based programming, we also emphasize the importance of monitoring their daily symptoms and response to previous exercise sessions. Any concerns can be communicated to the intervention staff prior to starting exercise. Additionally, the study team has access to and will regularly monitor the heart rate and sleep data of participants in order to track their status continuously. To begin the testing session, we will contact [CONTACT_371338]. For the balance test, the chair stand test and the walking tests, the study participant, the spouse/partner, and the study team will confirm that all tests can be completed in a safe area that is free of obstructions and that the ground is even/level. This will be done to minimize the possibility of injury. The first goal is to familiarize the participants with the smartphone, so they can operate the app for testing balance, and access and use the video camera for recording the tests. At this time, we will ask the participants spouse/partner to also familiarize themselves with the toolkit as they will be asked to take a series of short videos as the participant completes the tests. For security purposes this device is not connected to the internet so there is a reduced chance the material will be compromised. Instead, videos taken will be downloaded from the device once it is received by [CONTACT_978].  We will then proceed to guide the participant through the instructions, clarifying any queries they may have. We will require the participant to identify a safe, flat space in their home where they can complete the balance test. As the balance test completes the participant is given immediate feedback based on their results as to their fall risk. The study assessors will verify the participant can safely perform the rest of the tests. This first test (a validated tool to assess fall risk in elderly MS patients) will help us to determine whether our participants are safe to complete tests in their home.  We will then ask the participant to identify a standard dining-room type chair (approx. 17-19” seat height), from which they can perform the chair stand tests. Via video conference the study assessors will verify the participant can safely stand from seated. We will then ask the participant to set up the [ADDRESS_464427] in their home (if available) or on a flat surface on or near their property (e.g. drive way). Once the set-up is complete we will let the participant and spouse/partner complete the tests. We will be available to consult during this time, but to minimize distraction will not interfere.

With each study visit, serum hemoglobin/hematocrit will be obtained to assess for the presence of anemia, and serum chemistries will be obtained to assess serum creatinine to identify renal dysfunction.  Additionally, at baseline,3 & 6 months, blood will be obtained for long-term storage of serum and plasma for future studies.

This system allows flexibility in processing data management tasks, including the ability to register participants and verify eligibility criteria before randomization, provide the randomization assignment, and allow real-time monitoring and reporting of accrual, retention, and intervention adherence.   6.0         Analytic Plan   We will enroll 21 patients with 14 in the PAI and 7 in HLI.  The goal of this study is to determine feasibility and preliminary efficacy data.  We now describe these measurements.  Feasibility: We will determine the proportion of patients who agree to participate in the intervention.  Next, among patients who agree to participate we will determine what proportion are able to complete the intervention and document barriers to participation.  For all patients – both in the active and control groups, we will determine the proportion who are able to have the baseline and follow-up assessments of measures of interest (cardiovascular imaging, exercise measures (peak VO2 and 6 min walk distance).    In addition, for the patients receiving the active intervention we will assess the change in outcomes of interest to determine preliminary efficacy estimates.  The control patients will also provide some preliminary efficacy assessments.    With 21 patients we can estimate a 95% exact confidence interval (using the Clopper-Pearson method) for the proportion of patients who have measurements taken with a width of 0.578 (i.e., from 0.211 to 0.789 if the observed proportion is 0.5 – most conservative assumption).    For estimating the outcomes of interest, a 95% confidence interval will extend +/- 0.[ADDRESS_464430] deviation if there are 8 patients in the active group, +/- 0.635 if the sample size is 12 and +/- 0.554 SDs if the sample size is 15.  A number of assessments will be made on the patients enrolled.  These include measures of peak exercise cardiac output, calculated A-V O2 difference and VO2, and pre- exercise measures of LV & cognitive function, HRQOL, six-minute walk distance (6minWD) and fatigue.  For each of these measures we will calculate descriptive statistics in order to get some preliminary data concerning the mean values and variability of these measures.  We will also obtain mean and variability values of the MRI cardiac function and HRQOL data from the [ADDRESS_464431] Cancer Patients Undergoing Treatment – An addendum to NIH R01CA167821 “Early Imaging Detection of CV Injury after Cancer” Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center CCCWFU# [ZIP_CODE]

Page 75 of 114  Appendix J: NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTION TESTING BOOKLET  Preparing for Testing: • Test in a comfortable and quiet place. Distractions will affect patient’s performance • Arrange your materials so the patient cannot see this document. A tilted clipboard works well.  • Patient should be seated comfortably and directly in front of you.  • Have all the equipment ready before you begin.  Creating Rapport: • Use a friendly manner of speech. • You may encourage patients by [CONTACT_371348] (“You are doing fine”) but be careful not to signal correct or incorrect responses to test items. If a patient asks you if a response is correct say, “I cannot give you feedback, so just do the best you can,” • If the patient needs a break be sure it is not done during the HVLT-R Immediate Recall, Trail Making Test, or between words in the Controlled Oral Word Association Test. It is always better to suggest they use the bathroom before testing begins. • Should a patient appear distressed or nervous about their performance offer only a general encouragement such as, “You are doing fine” and remind them not to worry about mistakes.   General Guidelines: • Speak clearly and slowly. Enunciate. You are not allowed to repeat instructions for most tests so you must get it right the first time. Take your time to explain the tests. • Read exactly what is written in this document. Do not invent instructions or modify them. Read what is there. • Never make a statement like, “Oh, this one is hard” as it could affect performance. • Familiarize yourself with the procedure before testing. If you are rusty, pre-read this form and remove the rust. It will help to read the instructions out loud to yourself or someone else before you administer the battery.    Introducing the test battery:   Examiner: “Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study……Other patients could benefit from your efforts…….If you are ready, let’s get started…….I am going to have you do a series of tasks that challenge your memory and other thinking abilities.  You will not get every item correct, so don’t worry about it.  Just relax and do the best you can on each and every one. I will instruct you before each task so you will know what to do.  Some of the tasks will be timed so you will have to do them as quickly as you can. I will alert you about the timed tasks.  Shall we get started now?”  Administer the tests in the following order to every patient

Page [ADDRESS_464494] - REVISED (HVLT-R) This test has three parts and two alternate forms:  Part A - Free Recall:  Complete the three learning trials first  Part A – Free Recall: Trial 1   Examiner: “I am going to read a list of words to you. Listen carefully, because when I am through, I’d like you to tell me as many of the words as you can remember. You can tell them to me in any order. Are you ready?” • Read the words at the rate of one word every 2 seconds.    Examiner: “OK. Now tell me as many of those words as you can remember.” • Check off the words the patient recalls on the form. • If a word is said that is not in the list (referred to as an, “intrusion”), do not write that word on the form and say nothing to the patient about the word not being on the list. • There is no time limit for each recall trial.  However, if the patient does not produce any words for 10-15 seconds, ask the patient if he/she can remember any more words. • If not, move on to trial 2. Later, you can record the number of words that were correctly repeated on the summary form.  Part A – Free Recall: Trial 2   Examiner:  “Now we are going to try it again. I am going to read the same list of words to you. Listen carefully, and tell me as many of the words as you can remember, in any order, including the words you told me the first time.”  • Read the words at the rate of one word every 2 seconds.   • Check off the words the patient recalls on the form. • If a word is said that is not in the list (an “intrusion”), do not write that word on the form and say nothing to the patient about the word not being on the list. • There is no time limit for each recall trial.  However, if the patient does not produce any words for 10-15 seconds, ask the patient if he/she can remember any more words. • If not, move on to trial 3. Later, you can record the number of words that were correctly repeated on the summary form. Part A – Free Recall: Trial 3 Examiner:  “I am going to read the list one more time. As before, I’d like you to tell me as many of the words as you can remember, in any order, including all the words you’ve already told me.” • Read the words at the rate of one word every 2 seconds.   • Check off the words the patient recalls on the form.

Page [ADDRESS_464496] – Parts A & B [Timed Test]  Part A – Sample:  The Sample for Part A must be completed/attempted by [CONTACT_280107].  Place the Sample A worksheet flat on the table, directly in front of the patient (the bottom of the worksheet should be approximately six inches from the edge of the table).  Give the patient a black pen and say:  Examiner: “On this page (point) are some numbers. Begin at number 1 (point to 1) and draw a line from 1 to 2 (point to 2), 2 to 3 (point to 3), 3 to 4 (point to 4), and so on, in order, until you reach the end (point to the circle marked END).  Draw the lines as fast as you can. Ready, begin.”  If the patient completes Sample A correctly, and in a manner demonstrating that s/he understands what to do, proceed immediately to Test A. If the patient makes a mistake on Sample A, point out the error and explain it. The following explanations of mistakes serve as illustrations:  • “This is where you start (point to number 1)”  • “You skipped this circle (point to the circle omitted)” • “You should go from number [ADDRESS_464497] marked END”  If it is clear that the patient intended to touch a circle but missed it, do not count it as an omission.  Remind the patient, however, to be sure to touch the circles.  If the patient still cannot complete Sample A, take his/her hand and guide him/her through the trail using the opposite end of the pen, lightly touching the worksheet to avoid making marks on the copy. Then say:   Examiner: “Remember, begin at number 1 (point to 1) and draw a line from 1 to 2 (point to 2), 2 to 3 (point to 3), 3 to 4 (point to 4) and so on, in order, until you reach the circle marked END (point). Do not skip around, but go from one number to the next in proper order. Remember to work as fast as you can. Ready, begin.”  If the patient does not succeed, or it becomes evident that s/he cannot do the task, DISCONTINUE testing and indicate the corresponding reason on the Trail Making Data Sheet.  If the patient completes Sample A correctly and appears to understand what to do, proceed immediately to Part A.

Page 82 of 114  Trailmaking - Part B – Sample:  The Sample for Part B must be completed/attempted by [CONTACT_280107].  Place the Sample B worksheet flat on the table, directly in front of the patient (the bottom of the worksheet should be approximately six inches from the edge of the table) and say:  Examiner:  “On this page (point) are some numbers and letters. Begin at number 1 (point to 1) and draw a line from 1 to A (point), A to 2 (point to 2), 2 to B (point to B), B to 3 (point to 3), 3 to C (point to C) and so on, in order, until you reach the end (point to the circle marked END). Remember, first you have a number (point to 1), then a letter (point to A), then a number (point to 2), then a letter (point to B), and so on. Draw the lines as fast as you can. Ready, begin.”  If the patient completes Sample B correctly, and in a manner demonstrating that s/he understands what to do, proceed immediately to Part B. If the patient makes a mistake on Sample B, point out the error and explain it.  The following explanations of mistakes serve as illustrations:  • “You started with the wrong circle. This is where you start (point to number 1)” • “You skipped this circle (point to the circle omitted)”  • “You should go from number 1 (point) to A (point), A to 2 (point to 2), 2 to B (point to B), B to 3 (point to 3) and so on, until you reach the circle marked END (point)”  If it is clear the patient intended to touch a circle but missed it, do not count it as an omission.  Remind the patient, however, to be sure to touch the circles. If the patient still cannot complete Sample B, take their hand and guide them through the trail using the opposite end of the pen, lightly touching the worksheet to avoid making marks on the copy.

If the patient makes an error, call it to his/her attention immediately and have him/her proceed from the point the mistake occurred.  “You were correct up to here (point to last correct circle). Start here and continue as quickly as you can.” • The patient must complete the test in 5 minutes or less. (Do not tell patient). • DO NOT STOP TIMING UNTIL HE/SHE REACHES THE CIRCLE MARKED “END” • Collect the worksheet and record the time to completion on the Trail Making Data Sheet in minutes and seconds • If the patient does not complete the test within 5 minutes terminate the testing. (Say: “That’s fine. We will need to move on to the next task”) The test can also be discontinued if the patient is extremely confused and is unable to perform the task.  Collect the worksheet and complete the Trail Making Data Sheet indicating the reason the test was terminated and the last correct number or letter reached on the test.

Page [ADDRESS_464502] (COWA) [Timed Test]  This test has three parts (letters).  Examiner:  “I am going to say a letter of the alphabet, and I want you to say as quickly as you can all of the words that you can think of that begin with that letter.  You may say any words at all, except proper names such as the names of people or places.  So you would not say ‘[COMPANY_002]ster’ or ‘Robert’.  Also, do not use the same word again with a different ending, such as ‘Eat,’ and ‘Eating.’  “For example, if I say ‘S,’ you could say ‘son’, ‘sit,’ ‘shoe,’ or ‘slow.’  Can you think of other words beginning with the letter ‘s’?”  • Wait for the patient to give a word.  If it is a correct response, say “good”, and ask for another word beginning with the letter “s”.  If a second appropriate word is given, proceed to the test itself. • If the patient gives an inappropriate word on either occasion, correct the patient, and repeat the instructions.  If the patient then succeeds, proceed to the test. • If the patient fails to respond, repeat the instruction.  If it becomes clear that the patient does not understand the instructions or cannot associate, stop the procedure, and indicate the reason(s) on the scoring sheet. • If the patient has succeeded in giving two appropriate words beginning with the demonstration letter, say:  Examiner: “That is fine.  Now I am going to give you another letter and again you say all of the words beginning with that letter that you can think of.  Remember, no names of people or places, just ordinary words.  Also, if you should draw a blank, I want you to keep on trying until the time limit is up and I say STOP.”  “You will have a minute for each letter.  The first letter is ‘___’” (see scoring sheet).  **Allow exactly one minute for each letter**  • If the patient discontinues before the end of the time period, encourage him/her to try to think of more words. • If he/she is silent for 15 seconds, repeat the basic instruction and the letter (e.g., “Tell me all the words you can think of that begin with a “c”). • No extension on the time limit is made in the event that instructions are repeated. • Continue the evaluation with the remaining two letters, allowing one minute for each.

Page 88 of 114  Examiner: Remember, no names of people or places, just ordinary words.  Also, if you should draw a blank, I want you to keep on trying until the time limit is up and I say STOP.  You will have a minute for each letter. “The next letter is ‘___’” (see scoring sheet).   Recording and Scoring:  • The record sheet provides lines on which the patient’s responses can be entered (e.g., write in the word that is said by [CONTACT_102]).  If his/her speed of word production is too fast to permit verbatim recording, a “+” should be entered to indicate a correct response and try to write an abbreviated version. When time permits complete the abbreviation.  • Incorrect responses either should not be recorded or, if recorded, should be struck through with a line. • If the patient provides more responses than there are lines on the record sheet, write in the margins. • Count all the correct responses. The number of correct words should be indicated below each column on the recording sheet and on the summary data form that is sent to the CCCWFU.   Comments on scoring:  • Note:  It can be helpful for the first several patients and for patients known to be fast with their word production to tape record the session for transcription at a later time. • The instructions include a specific prohibition against giving proper names or different forms of the same word. Therefore, inflections of the same word (e.g., eat-eating; mouse-mice; loose-loosely; ran-run-runs) are not considered correct responses.  • Patients often give both a verb and a word derived from the verb or adjective (e.g., fun-funny; sad-sadness).  These are not considered correct responses. On the other hand, if the word refers to a specific object (e.g., foot-footstool; hang-hanger), it would be counted as a correct answer. • Many words have two or more meanings (e.g., foot; can; catch; hand).  A repetition of the word is acceptable IF the patient definitely indicates the alternative meaning to you. • Slang terms are OK if they are in general use. •  Foreign words (for example, pasta; passé; lasagna) can be counted as correct if they can be considered part of that relevant language, the criterion being their listing in a standard dictionary of that language. All incorrect and repeated responses MUST be crossed out with one single line, initialed and dated. Additionally, all duplicate entries that have been verified to have different meanings must be marked “ok”, initialed and dated. Refer to the descriptions above for guidelines for acceptability. Add the total number of correct responses in each column and input the totals where indicated on the COWA worksheet.  • If the test is discontinued or omitted, please mark this on the bottom of the test form and indicate the reason.

Page [ADDRESS_464505] • Administer the digit spans in order • Do not repeat a span once read. • Administer both spans of the same length regardless of how the participant performs. • Say the digits at a rate of 1 digit about every 1 sec. • Use a monotonic voice; without inflections at the end    Examiner:  “Now I am going to say some numbers, but this time when I stop I want you say them backwards.  For example, if I say 7-1-9, what would you say?” • If the participant responds correctly (9-1-7), say, That’s right,” and proceed to Item 1.  • If the participant fails the example, say: “No, you would say 9-1-7.  I said 7-1-9, so to say it backwards you would say 9-1-7.  Now try these numbers. Remember, you are to say them backwards 3-4-8.” • Whether the participant succeeds or fails with the second example (3-4-8), proceed to Item 1. Give no help on this second example or any of the items that follow. • Discontinue after failure on both trials of any item.  Scoring:  Each span is scored ‘0’ or ‘1’. Give 1 point if the participant passes the trial; and no points if the participant fails the trial.  Only discontinue test when participant has failed both trials of the same span length (e.g., 5a. and 5b.).

Examiner:  “Do you remember that list of words you tried to learn before? Tell me as many of those words as you can remember.”  • Check the box on the corresponding line of the HVLT-R worksheet for each word the patient accurately recalls. • If a word is said that is not in the list (referred to as an, “intrusion”), do not write that word on the form and say nothing to the patient about the word not being on the list. • There is no time limit for each recall trial.  However, if the patient does not produce any words for 10-15 seconds, ask the patient if he/she can remember any more words.

Page [ADDRESS_464525] these tests, become familiar with the Android device. Specifically, they will need to be able to operate the camera/video app found on the home screen. 12. We would like you to complete all the tests in one attempt. The total time taken to complete the full battery of tests should be between 40-60 minutes. 13. One of the walking tests will be completed at a usual walking pace (4m walk), while the other is done as fast as you can without running (6MWT). 14. Please complete the following tests in the stated order. It is important to be adequately recovered for the start of each test.  Test Order 1. Balance tests - Steady App (If your balance test results show you have a low risk for a fall [≤40/100], you may continue to the rest of the tests.) 2. 4-meter walk test. 3. Chair stand test. (You may rest after this test, until such time as you feel you have regained your breath and can talk normally.) 4. Grip strength test. 5. 6-minute walk test.   Balance Test - Steady App Instructions The Steady App is designed to evaluate your balance and determine your fall risk before continuing with the rest of the physical tests. The App can be found on the Home screen of the Samsung device you received in your package.   Find a firm, safe, flat area to complete the balance tests. A room with a table or shelf at about hip height can be used for support should you feel it may be necessary to catch your balance. You may also stand behind the chair you will use for some of the remaining tests. Do not do this test on a soft surface like grass, or a thick carpet.  1. Open the Steady App  2. When prompted, insert your test subject number (if not sure ask the research team)

Page [ADDRESS_464526] finished, you will be provided with a fall risk score. If your score is ≤40, you may continue with the rest of the tests.   General Testing Assistant Instructions  Once the participant has completed the balance tests using the Steady app, if low risk for a fall, they will then perform the remaining physical tests. The Camera app, located on the home screen of the Samsung Android device will be used to film the participant completing each test.   The position you will stand in is slightly different for filming each test so check the specific instructions for each test section before you start.  With the Camera app open, you will see a smaller red dot to the left of the large white dot in a bar across the bottom of the screen. This is how you will start the video.  1. To film the participant performing each test, make sure both you and they are ready to begin.  2. Hold the phone in the vertical position. Make sure you can clearly see the participant in the frame of the camera before starting the test. 3. Start with your finger on the red dot and release the button as you start to count down “3, 2, 1, GO”. You will begin each test that you film with the same instructions for consistency. Note: Do not press the button as you say GO as there will be a slight delay at the start of the video and it is important to capture the beginning of the test. 4. To end the test, press the white dot (with a smaller black square) in the middle of the bar across the bottom of the screen. 5. Before you perform any of the tests, practice filming a few short clips.

Do not complete this test on a soft, uneven surface like a lawn or a busy sidewalk where you will be interrupted.  1. Hook the loops at the ends of the 15m rope onto the weighted markers in the test kit.  2. Place the weighted anchors (marked with orange crosses) in a straight line until the slack is removed from the rope. Be careful to not overstretch the rope. 3. Place a chair perpendicular (at a right angle) to the marker at the end of the walking course (close to position A). Make sure the chair does not obstruct the walking course. You will use this same chair for the sit-to stand tests (chair stands) and to provide you with somewhere to sit should you become fatigued or should you need a break during the walking test.  4. You will also perform the grip strength tests while seated in this chair.    4-meter Walk Test The test will require you to walk at a usual pace for a distance of 4 meters. You will complete 2 sets (repeats) of this test.  Testing Assistant Position and Instructions As the person filming the test you will want to stand in line with the end marker the participant will walk towards. This will be opposite position A. From this vantage point, you will follow the participant until they walk past the marker at the end of the rope.   To film the test:  5. Open the camera app on the Samsung device.  6. Make sure the participant is fully viewable in the frame of the screen.  7. Ask the participant to slowly walk towards the marker at the end of the rope and make sure you can follow them through the 4m course.

To film the test:  1. Open the camera app on the Samsung device.  2. Make sure the participant is fully viewable in the frame of the screen.  3. Ask the participant to slowly stand up from seated and make sure they have correct form. 4. When you are ready, have the participant start with their arms crossed and hands placed on their shoulders.  5. Remind the participant to stand upright completely before returning to the seated position. 6. Place your finger on the red dot and release as you start to say “3, 2, 1, GO”. 7. After 35 seconds press the white dot and say “STOP” loudly to end the test. 8. Open the gallery app on the phone and make sure the test was filmed.  Participant Instructions 1. Start seated toward the front edge of the chair with your feet shoulder-width and positioned behind your knees, and arms folded across your chest (see start stop positions in pi[INVESTIGATOR_371318]).  2. You may complete one practice trial, and ask for any corrective feedback as necessary. 3. When both the participant and the person who is videoing the test are ready, have the person filming, start the test with “3, 2, 1, GO.” After they say ‘GO,’ you will stand all the way up, and return to the original seated position.  4. Repeat the stands as many times as you can until you hear the assistant say STOP! 5. You may stop the test early if you become very tired or short of breath during the repeated chair stands. 6.

SYNOPSIS 
TITLE  
A Dose Escalation Trial of AZD-1775  (a Wee1 inhibitor) and Gemcitabine- Radiation in 
Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer  
 
PROTOCOL NUMBER  
UMCC 2013.094 
CLINICAL PHASE  
Phase I/II  
RATIONALE  
We have developed the use of the combination of gemcitabine and radiation in the 
treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer.  These agents cause DNA damage to 
cancer cells leading to tumor response.  However, the disease often progresses after treatment.  Our preclinical studies at the University of Michigan have shown that normal cells have both a functional G1 and G2 checkpoint that permits them to repair DNA 
damage before undergoing DNA synthesis and mitosis , respectively, thereby [CONTACT_271845].  In contrast, pancreatic cancer cell s lack a G1 checkpoint after DNA damage 
due either to mutations in p53 or in the p53 pathway.  Our preclinical work has 
demonstrated that inhibition of Wee1 kinase by [CONTACT_99213]-1775 abrogates the G2 checkpoint, 
the only functional checkpoint in pancreatic cancer cells, which causes the pancreatic 
cancer cells, but not normal cells, to progress into mitosis before repairing the DNA 
damage, leading to pancreatic cancer cell death.  Pancreatic cancer cells are selectively 
killed compared to normal cells, which ret ain a functional G1 checkpoint.  AZD-1775 
causes a selective increase in pancreatic cancer cell death both from radiation and from 
gemcitabine, suggesting that this strategy will improve the outcome of treatment of both 
local and (occult) systemic diseas e. 
 
OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of this study are:  
Primary   
Determine the maximum tolerated dose of AZD-1775 in combination with 
gemcitabine and radiation in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.  
 Secondary  
1. To estimate the efficacy of this regi men (combined with standard 
systemic therapy) at the target dose, as determined by [CONTACT_3988]- free 
survival and overall survival at one year . 
2. To determine if Wee1 is inhibited by [CONTACT_99213]-[ADDRESS_331895] of administration of both AZD-1775 and gemcitabine (with 
and without radiation) at assigned dose levels in accordance with a Time-to -Event 
Continual Reassessment Method (TITE -CRM).  
 
1. Cycle 1:  AZD-1775  will be given orally (day 1,2 and 8,9 of a 21-day 
cycle) with gemcitabine given intravenously over 30 minutes  on day 1 and 
day 8.   
2. Cycles 2 and 3:  The  same 21-day cycle of AZD-1775 and gemcitabine 
will be administered as in Cycle 1 but with concurrent radiation therapy.   
Two cycles will be given with 25 radiation treatments.  
3. Cycle 3 is followed by a 3 week break in treatment.  
4. Cycle 4:  AZD-1775- gemcitabine as described in cycle 1. 
 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined based on the development of 
dose- limiting toxicitie s within the first [ADDRESS_331896] pathologically confirmed locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma.   
 
ESTIMATED LENGTH OF PATIENT PARTICI PATION  
Patients may continue to receive treatment until the development of unacceptable 
toxicities or progressive disease. It is estimated that patients who discontinue treatment because of toxicity or progressive disease will participate an average of 3 months with 
one additional month of follow -up. Patients who experience a response or stable disease 
are expected to participate an average of 6 months plus an additional 6- 12 months for 
follow -up. 
ESTIMATED STUDY DATES  
December 2013 (first study screening v isit) to December  2018 (last study follow -up visit)  
INVESTIGATIONAL REGIMEN DOSE/ ROUTE/ DURATION  
AZD-1775 will be administered at assigned dose and taken orally on days 1 and 2 and 
on days 8 and 9 until the development of unacceptable toxicity, progression of disease, 
or patient decision to discontinue therapy.

SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
Safety assessments will be conducted every weekly on the day of chemotherapy 
administration and weekly during the course  of radiation therapy and include clinical 
evaluation, assessment of adverse events and laboratory evaluation. 
Adverse event seriousness, severity grade, and relationship to study treatment will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_093]. Severity grade will be defined by [CONTACT_6808] (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 
(to permit comparison to prior studies of AZD-1775).  
TUMOR ASSESSMENTS 
Tumor evaluation using CT or MRI will be performed within 4 weeks of registration and prior to beginning cycle 4 of treatment (1 month after chemoradiation) and approximately every 3 months afterwards.  Response will be evaluated using Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1. 
OTHER ASSESSMENTS 
During the first  or second cycle of treatment, patients will be asked to undergo 2 punch 
biopsies of the skin: one will occur  approximately 3 h after treatment with gemcitabine (but 
before AZD-1775)  on day 1 of a cycle and the second will occur on day 2 of a cycle 
approximat ely 3 -5 hours after AZD -1775 .  Utilizing immunohistochemistry, we will assess 
Wee1 signaling in response to AZD-1775 in combination with gemcitabine. Using a punch 
biopsy of the skin to evaluate replicating cells in hair follicles, we anticipate that AZD-1775  
plus gemcitabine will reduce Cdk1 (Y15) phosphorylation relative to gemcitabine alone, confirming Wee1 inhibition. To confirm Wee1 pathway inhibition, we will assess the mitotic 
marker pHistoneH3, and anticipate that it will be increased in response to AZD-[ADDRESS_331897] 4 cycles of treatment (with 
a 3 week break between cycle 3 and cycle 4), for a total of 105 days in length.  
 
The target rate DLT is 30%. The target rate will  define the MTD of AZD- 1775) given 
concurrently with gemcitabine (and radiation therapy for 2 cycles) for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.  
 
Expected rates of acute toxicity have been estimated based upon our previous treatment 
experience with gemcitabine- radiation plus cisplatin or oxaliplatin and from gemcitabine-
AZD-[ADDRESS_331898] to accrue 1-2 patients per month from the multidisciplinary pancreatic cancer 
clinic at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, therefore completing 
accrual to this trial in approximately 3 years.  
 
Cohort size  
Patients will be recruited as available and allocated to treatment according to the 
estimated toxicity rates. No formal cohort size is required; however, a tot al over one or 
more subjects, of at least [ADDRESS_331899] can be treated at Dose j+1

1.0 BACKGROUND 
 
1.1 Treatment of Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer  
Pancreatic cancer remains mostly incurable with an overall 5- year survival of less than 
5% (1). Resection is the only therapy with potential for cure, but most patients present w ith 
metastatic or unresectable disease.  In the case of unresectable pancreatic cancer, the 
standard therapy developed in the 1980’s was the combination of fluorouracil ( 5FU) and 
radiation.  In the 1990’s gemcitabine was shown to be superior to 5FU in patients with advanced pancreas cancer (2).  Therefore, we decided to explore combining radiation 
therapy with gemcitabine.  We were the first to show that gemcitabine is a potent 
radiosensitizer of human tumor cells (3) and of pancreas cancer cells (4).  These initial 
studies and those of other investigators established that radios ensitization occurred under 
conditions of simultaneous dATP pool depletion and redistribution of cells into S phase (3, 
5). In addition, radiosensitization depended on homologous recombination (6) and, in 
other studies, on mismatch repair (7). Importantly, studies in animal models showed that 
the combination of gemcitabine and radiation could improve the therapeutic index (8, 9).  
 Based on these reports, investigators began incorporating gemcitabine into the treatment of unresectable disease. Our group at the University of Michigan was the first to conduct 
prospective clinical trials investigating the combination of full -dose gemcitabine and 
radiotherapy for locally advanced unresectable cancer as well as in the adjuvant post -
operative setting (10, 11). The objective of these trials was to design a regimen that would 
use the most effective drug, gemcitabine, at its full systemic intensity, and at the same 
time, take advantage of its radiosensitizing properties (4). The key conclusion from this 
and our subsequent preclinical (12, 13) and clinical studies adding cisplatin (14) or 
oxaliplatin (15) to gemcitabine in patients with locally advanced disease is that conformal 
radiation permits the use of full systemic doses of chemotherapy, which is important support for testing the hypotheses proposed in this clinical trial.  
 
Although pancreatic canc er has a tendency to metastasize, recent evidence confirms that 
radiation therapy improves survival in patients who do not have gross metastatic disease. A recent phase III trial for patients with unresectable disease has shown that the 
combination of gemc itabine and radiation produced a statistically significant improvement 
in survival compared to gemcitabine alone, demonstrating that local therapy can improve 
survival (16).  This is consistent with an autopsy study that found that 1/3 of patients who 
die of pancreatic cancer died due to complications of local disease progression (17).  
 
Our data also support the hypothesis that intensification of local therapy, while maintaining full dose system therapy, can improve survival.  We recently completed a radiation dose 
escalation study  (using 1000 mg/m2 of gemcitabin e 2 weeks on one week off)  for patients 
with the same eligibility criteria proposed for the current trial (18).  The radiation dose level 
was assigned using TITE- CRM with a DLT target rate set to 0.25. Fifty patients were 
accrued. DLTs were observed in 11 patients: G3/4 anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and/or dehydration (7); duodenal bleed (3); duodenal perforation (1). The probability of DLT at 55 
Gy (0.24) was clos est to the target. The 2 -year FFLP was 59% (95% CI: 32- 79). Median 
and 2 - year overall survival were 14.8 months (95% CI: 12.6- 22.2) and 30% (95% CI 17-
45). Twelve patients with initially unresectable disease underwent resection (10 R0, 2 R1) and survived a median of [ADDRESS_331900] survival reported for patients with unresectable disease.

To summarize this section, full dose gemcitabine (alone or with oxaliplatin or cisplatin) can 
be administered safely with full dose radiation if conformal radiation techniques are used.  
Although some progress has been made by [CONTACT_271846] (19)and 
gemcitabine- nab paclitaxel (20) in the treatment of metastatic disease, these  new 
combinations have not yet been demonstrated to improve survival for patients with locally 
advanced disease nor when combined with radiation therapy.  Thus, new systemic agents, particularly those that can be combined effectively with radiation, are urgently needed. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_331901] tumor cells exhibit abnormalities in one or 
more aspects of cell cycle regulation (i.e., "checkpoints"), and that these abnormalities present an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. The overall concept is that defects 
in the cell cycle regulation systems of tumor cells may render them more vulnerable to 
drug treatments than normal cells, due to failure of checkpoints to prevent inappropriate 
DNA replication or mitotic entry.  In particular, we have focused on Wee1 inhibitors, which 
can both abrogate the G2 checkpoint and inhibit homologous recombination repair. The 
great majority of pancreatic cancers express either mutant or non -functioning p53, and, 
therefore, lack a G1 checkpoint.   Tumors must, therefore, depend on the G2 checkpoint to protect themselves from DNA damaging agents.  Thus, a Wee1 inhibitor would be 
predicted to potentiate the activity of drugs, such as gemcitabine, and radiation, against 
tumor cells.  In fact, we and others have demonstrated that a highly selective inhibitor of Wee1, AZD-1775, can sensitize to radiation and to gemcitabine (21-26). AZD-[ADDRESS_331902] deficient malignancies.

This is a dose -escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose of AZD-1775 
when administered with gemcitabine and radiation, in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Dose -escalation will be managed by [CONTACT_271853] -CRM algorithm (see 
below), with the goal of establishing the target dose, as per the table below. Astra Zeneca  
has established that  AZD-1775 at 175 mg QD x 2 doses with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m
2). 
is the MTD . Therefore, our goal would be to reach 175 mg (day 1,  2 and 8,9) with full dose 
gemcitabine, although we would anticipate pCDC2 inhibition might be achieved at lower doses (see Sections 10 and 11 for biomarker assessment).

6.1.3  Dose adjustments for chemotherapy during a cycle and for subsequent 
cycles can be found in section 8.0. 
 
6.2 AZD-1775  
6.2.1  AZD-1775 will  be administered, with the assistance of the University of 
Michigan Investigational Drug Services Pharmacy, as an oral capsule 3 -4 
hours and 24 hours after completion of the gemcitabine infusion.  
6.2.2  The dose of AZD-1775 will be escalated according to the TITE -CRM design 
(see section 12.0)  
 
6.3 Radiation Therapy  
6.3.1  Treatment Planning 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Planning will be performed based on a helical CT obtained within [ADDRESS_331913]. Helical scans will be obtained with a large (48 cm or greater) field 
of view, using an aperture of 3.[ADDRESS_331914] 
data will be transferred to a treatment planning system for contouring of 
critical structures.  Active Breathing Control will be used to reduce/eliminate 
breathing motion.  If a patient cannot tolerate ABC, a 4D CT will used to 
generate an internal target volume (ITV).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined as the gross tumor including enlarged regional lymph nodes.  The clinical target volume (CTV) will be 
the GTV,  plus a margin of 0.5 cm to account for occult invasion.  An ITV

7.0 DRUG INFORMATION 
7.1.Gemcitabine  
7.1.1    Description – Gemcitabine hydrochloride (2’,  2’-difluoro- 2’deoxycytidine)  is 
a deoxycytidine analog with structural and metabolic similarities to 
cytarabine. Gemcitabine is metabolized intracellularly by [CONTACT_271854] - and triphosphate nucleosides.  The active nucleosides 
interfere with ribonucleotide reductase and compete with dCTP for 
incorporation into DNA, respectively, resulting in inhibition of DNA 
synthesis. Gemcitabine pharmacokinetics are linear and are described by 
a two compartment model.  Half -life varies with age, gender, and infusion 
length; for a short infusion it is generally less than 70 minutes.  Nearly all 
of an administered dose is recovered in the urine as active drug (<10%) or 
inactive uracil metabolite.  The maximum plasma concentrations of the 
inactive metabolite are achieved 30 minutes after discontinuation of the infusions, and the metabolite is excreted in the urine without undergoing 
further biotransformation.  The metabolite does not accumulate with weekly 
dosing, but its elimination is dependent on renal excretion, and could 
accumulate with decreased renal function. 
7.1.2  Human Toxicity - Myelosuppression is the principal dose- limiting factor with 
gemcitabine therapy including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia.  
Dose escalation trial of Wee1 inhibitor

Non-hematologic toxicities include reversible hepatic enzyme elevati ons, 
gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  and stomatitis), fever 
in the absence of infection, flu- like syndrome, rash, and peripheral edema.  
Rarely hemolytic -uremic syndrome, drug -induced pneumonitis and sepsis 
have been reported.  
7.1.3  Pharmaceutical Data – Gemcitabine is supplied as a lyophilized powder in 
sterile vials containing 200 mg or 1 g of gemcitabine as the hydrochloride 
salt, with mannitol and sodium acetate.  Gemcitabine is reconstituted with 
0.9% sodium chloride without preservatives and used within 24 hours.  
7.1.4  Administration – Intravenous infusion over 30 minutes (see treatment plan).  
7.1.5  Storage and Stability – Store at controlled room temperature.  
7.1.6  Supplier – Gemcitabine is commercially available for purchase by [CONTACT_271855].  
 
7.2 AZD-1775  
7.2.1  Description - The chemical name [CONTACT_271865]-1775 is 2 -allyl-1- [6-(1-hydroxy -
1-methylethyl)pyridin -2-yl]-6-{[4-(4-methylpi[INVESTIGATOR_9482]-1- yl)phenyl]amino} -
1,2-dihydro- 3H-pyrazolo[3,4- d]pyrimidin - 3-one. The clinical formulation of 
AZD-1775 contains the active ingredient in a DFC, in 10 mg, 25 mg, and 
100 mg strengths (RC- DFC; PMF). AZD-1775 is the only active ingredient 
in the clinical formulation. AZD-1775 is a highly selective, adenosine-
triphosphate (ATP) competitive, small- molecule inhibitor of Wee1 kinase.  
The maximum concentration of AZD-1775 is reached from 1 to 4 hours 
after oral dosing and the ½ life is 9- 11 hours.  
7.2.2  Human toxicity – In phase I trials of AZD-1775 combined with gemcitabine, 
the chief toxicity has been hematologic (including both neutropenia and thrombocytopenia).  Fatigue and elevated transaminases (AST and ALT) 
have also been noted.  Updated information for AZD- [ADDRESS_331916] of 
sepsis has been reported while taking AZD- 1775.  
7.2.3  Pharmaceutical Data - AZD-1775 is a crystalline, non- hygroscopic, 
monohydrate of the neutral drug. It dehydrates upon heating leading to formation of a crystalline anhydrate. AZD-1775 is available for clinical trials 
as a roller -compacted granule of AZD-1775 and excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (RC- DFC). The 
RC-DFC consists of a roller compacted granule of AZD-1775, lactose, 
microcrys talline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium and intragranular 
magnesium stearate. The granule is lubricated with a further quantity of extragranular magnesium stearate prior to encapsulation of the granule. The active potencies for the RC -DFCs are 25 mg and 100 mg in size 2 
gelatin capsules.  
7.2.4  Administration – AZD-1775 is administered as an oral capsule (see 
treatment plan)  
7.2.5  Storage and Stability - The capsules are packaged in high -density 
polyethylene (HDPE) bottles fitted with induction seals. Clinical supplies 
should be stored at not more than 30°C.  
7.2.6  Supplier – AZD-1775 is supplied by [CONTACT_38966], Inc.

8.0     DOSAGE MODIFICATIONS  
8.1 Dose modifications For Chemotherapy (Gemcitabine and AZD-1775) 
Within in a Cycle (day 8 treatment)  
8.1.1  Hematolog ic toxicity - dose adjustments of gemcitabine and AZD-1775 will 
be made based on the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count taken on the day of therapy.  
8.1.2  For ANC ≥ 1,000 /mm
3 and platelets ≥ 75,000/mm3, full dose will be given.  
8.1.3  For ANC of 500- 999/mm3 and/or platelets of 50,000 to 74,999/mm3, 50% 
of the gemcitabine dose due will be given and AZD-1775 will be given only 
on day 9 (instead of both days 8 and 9).  
8.1.4  For ANC < 500/mm3 or platelets < 50,000/mm3, the treatment will be held. 
If this toxicity occurs during radiation therapy (cycle 2 or 3), radiation 
therapy will also be held, with combined modality treatment resuming upon 
recovery to values permitting chemotherapy. Combined modality treatment 
will resume (cycles 2 and  3) when ANC > 500 and plat elets  > 50,000/mm3 
with gemcitabine given at 50% dose reduction. If this hematologic toxicity 
occurs beyond cycle 3, the dose of gemcitabine (and AZD-1775) will be 
dropped and not made up.   
8.1.5  Non-hematological toxicity - Dose adjustments of chemotherapy will be 
made following assessment of non- hematological toxicity on the day of 
therapy. Chemotherapy will be held for ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_331917] 
supportive therapy. Treatment will be resumed upon recovery to toxicity < 
grade 1. If non- hematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 occurs in any cycle beyond 
cycle 3, the chemotherapy dose will be omitted and treatment resumed when toxicity resolves to < grade 1 beginning a new cycle with a 25% dose 
reduction of gemcitabine.  
8.1.6  If a day 8 dose of chemotherapy is delayed or omitted because of toxicity, 
all subsequent gemcit abine and AZD-1775 doses will be given at 75% 
previous dose.   
 
8.2 Chemotherapy Dose Modifications for Subsequent Cycles  
8.2.1  A cycle of therapy may begin when ANC ≥ 1,000 /mm3, platelet count is ≥ 
75,000/mm3, and all other treatment related toxicity has resolved t o ≤ grade 
2. 
8.2.2  If a chemotherapy treatment is not given the day it is due for toxicity per section 7.1, all subsequent gemcitabine and AZD-1775 doses will be given 
at 75% of the previous dose. Once reduced for toxicity requiring delay/omission, chemotherapy doses will not be re- escalated.  
8.2.3  If therapy is not given for treatment related toxicity and recovery allowing for treatment does not occur within four weeks of the date treatment was 
due, the patient is off protocol.  
 
8.3 Radiation Therapy Modifications:   Radiat ion will be held for up to one week 
when     chemotherapy is held.  Radiation will restart the second week even if 
chemotherapy does not restart.  Otherwise, there will be no adjustments of the 
radiation therapy dose.

9.3 Toxicity Assessment  
Toxicity will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. Toxicity will be assessed on each 
chemotherapy visit, weekly during radiation therapy and at each follow -up 
visit. Dose -limiting hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities will be 
defined differently, and will be based on events occurring up to 2 months 
after the completion of chemoradiation (approximately [ADDRESS_331922] day of treatment). In order to be declared a dose- limiting toxicity, an 
adverse experience must be at least possibly related (i.e. definitely, 
probabl y, or possibly) to study therapy  
9.4 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
9.4.1  Grade 4- 5 hematological toxicity with the exception of Grade 4 anemia, 
Grade 4 leukopenia, Grade 4 neutropenia lasting for <7 days and Grade 4 
thrombocytopenia lasting for <4 days, EXCEPT if a platelet transfusion is 
required (in other words, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia that requires a platelet 
transfusions considered a DLT). ; 
9.4.2  Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia with fever >38.5°C and/or infection 
requiring antibiotic or anti -fungal treatment  
9.4.3  Grade ≥3 non- hematological toxicity, except:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_271837] 48 hours  
[IP_ADDRESS]  hyperbilirubinemia/cholangitis secondary to biliary obstruction 
[IP_ADDRESS]  any grade of alopecia;  
[IP_ADDRESS]  inadequately treated hypersensitivity reactions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  clinically non-significant, treatable or reversible lab abnormalities including 
such as glucose, uric acid, etc.  
9.4.4  Missed doses:  if a patient misses 50% of the scheduled dose of AZD-1775 
during the observation period (4 cycles/ 8  doses), it will be considered a 
DLT (except if due to poor patient compliance in the absence of treatment -
related  toxicity).  For example, if a  patient is assigned 125 mg x 8  doses, 
then wit hout missing or reducing dose patient would take 1000 mg. If th e 
patient was able to receive < 500 mg, it would be considered a DLT.  
9.4.5  A delay of >2 weeks in the scheduled administration of radiation, 
gemcitabine, and AZD-1775 due to drug -related toxicities which do not 
qualify as a DLT per the guidelines above (except if the delay is due to a cause unrelated to the disease or treatment under study (e.g. family 
emergency or auto accident)  will be scored as a DLT.   
 
 
9.5 Definition of Outcome Measures  
9.5.1  Progression Free Survival:  Time from date of registration to the date of 
documented progressive disease, other disease related therapy or death.  
9.5.2  Response Rate:  Objective response assessed from the CT scan obtained 
prior to cycle 4 and again at completion of study tr eatment.  
9.5.3  Freedom from Local Progression: Time from date of registration to the date 
of documented local progressive disease.  
9.5.4  Overall Survival: Time from date of registration to date of death or last follow up.  
 
9.6 Criteria for Removal from Study  
Dose escalation trial of Wee1 inhibitor

9.6.1  Evidence of progressive disease.  
9.6.2  Treatment delay of > [ADDRESS_331923] also be reported.  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  will continue to be 
followed until:  
• Resolution o f the symptoms or signs that constitute the serious adverse event 
return to baseline;  
• There is satisfactory explanation other than the study treatment for the changes observed; or  
• Death.  
The investigator is  responsible for the detection, documentation, grading, and 
assignment of attribution of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE.  The definitions of AEs and SAEs are given below.  It is the responsibility of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_271838].  
Any medical condition or laboratory abnormality with an onset date before initial 
study treatment is considered to be pre -existing in nature.  Any known pre-
existin g conditions that are ongoing at time of study entry should be considered 
medical history.  
All events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as defined in Section 
10.1.2,  occurring from the time of informed consent  through [ADDRESS_331924] be recorded as an adverse event in the patient’s 
source documents and on the CRF regardless of frequency, severity (grade) 
or assessed relationship to the study treatment.  
In addition to new events, any increase in the frequency or severity (i.e., toxicity 
grade) of a pre -existing condition that occurs after the patient begins study 
treatment is also considered an adverse event.  
10.1.2  Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving study treatment and which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
Dose escalation trial of Wee1 inhibitor    
 20 
an experimental intervention, whether or not related to the 
intervention.  
 
• Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive (i.e., 
surgical) procedures will not be reported as adverse events.  
However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed must be reported if it meets the definition of an 
adverse event unless it is a pre- existing (prior to protocol 
treatment) condition.  
 
• Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require 
therapy.  They are to be captured under the signs, symptoms or 
diagnoses associated with them.  
 
• All AEs will be categorized according to system organ class for 
annual reporting to the FDA.   Only grade [ADDRESS_331925] to be related to the 
study treatment (RT + gemcitabine + AZD-1775) will be 
reported to the IRB.   SAE’s will be reported per 10.1.4. 
• During the course of an adverse event, severity and/or causality 
and/or seriousness may change.  For CRF documentation this adverse event represents one entity from onset to resolution and the worst of the observed categories shall be attributed  
 
• When event reoccurs after it disappeared, it should be handled as a new AE.  However, AEs that occur intermittently can be recorded as one AE  
Serious Adverse Event  
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of the 
investigator it results in any of the following outcomes:  
  
o Death 
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease 
should be reported as ev ent (SAE) itself.  
 
o A life -threatening adverse event  
An adverse even is considered ‘life- threatening’ if, in the view of 
the investigator its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.  
 
o Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9959] > [ADDRESS_331926] normal life functions  
 
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
o Important medical event  
Any event that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition of “Serious 
Adverse Event”.  Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58166].  
 
o Any events or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271839] (with the exception of death)  should not 
be reported as a SAE.  The causality of SAEs (i.e., their relationship to study treatment) will be assessed by [CONTACT_271856] 8.2.2  
 
Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent form) 
surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying 
medical condition has worsened during the course of the study.  Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271840]’s medical history at the time of study enrollment should not be considered SAEs.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16500] a 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (for example, for the administration of study 
therapy or other protocol -required procedure) should not be 
considered SAEs.  However, if the preexisting condition worsened 
during the course of the study, it should be reported as an SAE.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271841], such as admission for palliative care or pain 
management will not constitute a SAE.  
 
Expected Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if: 
• For approved and marketed drugs or devices, those 
adverse events are described in the approved Package Insert (Label).  
• For investigational new drugs or devices, those adverse events are described in the FDA Investigator’s Brochure.  
• In clinical research studies, information on expected adverse events is also summarized in the protocol and in the consent document.  See section 9.[ADDRESS_331927] of 
expected adverse events related to the drug unde r study.  
Dose escalation trial of Wee1 inhibitor    
 22 
Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “unexpected” if it is not 
described in the Package Insert, Investigator’s Brochure, in 
published medical literature, in the protocol, or in the informed 
consent document.  
 
 
10.1.3  Adverse Event  Characteristics  
CTCAE Term  
(AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales 
found in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.[ADDRESS_331928] access to a copy of the 
CTCAE version 3.0.  (We recognize that the current CTCAE list 
version is 4.0.  However, all prior studies with AZD-[ADDRESS_331929] been 
conducted using version 3.0, and this scoring will greatly facilitate comparison to prior studies.)  
Attribution of the AE  
The investigator or co- investigator is responsible for assignment of 
attribution.  
Definite  – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.  
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
Unlikely  – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_331930] be notified within 2 business days 
of study team’s knowledge of any event meeting the criteria and definition of a serious adverse event related to study treatment 
occurring during the study or within [ADDRESS_331931] 
administration of the study related treatment . 
Only adverse events deemed serious and related will be reported 
to the IRB within 7 days of awareness of the event.  All other events 
will be noted in the patient’s medical record and reported to the IRB 
according to IRB guidelines . 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting to  Astra -Zeneca and FDA :

related) will be submitted to the FDA within 7 calendar days.    
 
10.1.5  Routine Reporting 
Adverse events will no longer be reported if the patient has another 
pancreas -directed therapy  
10.1.6 Reporting of Unanticipated Problems  
Upon becoming aware of any incident, experience, or outcom e (not 
related to an adverse event) that may represent an unanticipated 
problem, the investigator should assess whether the incident, 
experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem.  The incident, experience, or outcome is considered unanticipated if it 
meets all of the following criteria:  
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency);  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research; 
and 
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a 
greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized.  
If the investigator determines that the incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an unanticipated problem, the investigator 
must report it to the IRB within 7 calendar days of the study team 
becoming aware of the problem if the problem is serious, and within 
14 calendar days if the problem is non- serious.  
 
 
10.1 Data and Safety Monitoring  
10.2.1  This trial will be monitored in accordance with the NCI approved 
University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center Data and Safety 
Monitor ing Plan.  
 The study specific Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), 
consisting of the protocol investigators, data manager or designee and other members of the study team involved with the conduct of the trial, 
will meet monthly or more frequently depending on the activity of the 
protocol to provide continuous review of the data and patient safety. The 
discussion will include matters related to the safety of study participants 
(SAE/UaP reporting), validity and integrity of the data, enrollment rate relative to expectations, characteristics of participants, retention of 
participants, adherence to the protocol (potential or real protocol deviations) and data completeness. 
 
At the regular DSMC meetings, the protocol specific Data and Safety 
Monitoring Report form will be completed. The report will be signed by 
[CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_271842] -investigators. 
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Reports will be submitted to the University 
of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitori ng 
Board (DSMB) on a monthly basis for independent review.  
Dose escalation trial of Wee1 inhibitor    
 [ADDRESS_331932] or second cycle of treatment, patients will undergo 2 
biopsies: the first will occur  3 h after treatment with gemcitabine (but before 
AZD-1775)  on day 1 of cycle 1 or 2, and the second will occur 
approximately 3- 5 hours after AZD -1775 administration on day 2 of cycle 1 
or 2.   We will obtain 3mm punch biops ies of the skin to evaluate replicat ing 
cells in hair follicles.   Patients who refuse skin biopsies are still eligible for 
treatment.  
 
11.3 Biomarkers  
Utilizing immunohistochemistry, we will assess Wee1 signaling in response to AZD-1775 in combination with gemcitabine. Using a punch biopsy of the 
skin to evaluate replicating cells in hair follicles, we hypothesize that AZD-
1775 plus gemcitabine will reduce Cdk1 (Y15) phosphorylation relative to 
gemcitabine alone, confirming Wee1 inhibition. To confirm Wee1 pathway 
inhibition, we will assess the mitotic marker pHistoneH3, and anticipate that it will be increased in response to AZD-1775 plus gemcitabine relative to 
gemcitabine alone. To confirm the presence of DNA damage in response to AZD-1775 we will evaluate γH2AX and pChk1 (S345) (29). We expect 
that AZD-1775 plus gemcitabine will lead to an induction of these surrogate 
markers of DNA damage.  Other potential biomarkers of AZD-1775 activity 
include Capsase- 3 cleavage and Rad51 foci.  Eight genes (CLSPN, 
CCNE1, MCM10, MYB, CCNE2, FBX05, EGR1, and HIST1H2BD) have been identified as potential candidates for PD markers by [CONTACT_271857].  
 
12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a phase I dose -escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose of AZD-
1775 when administered with gemcitabine ± radiation, in patients with unresectable 
pancreatic cance r.  Dose -escalation will be managed by [CONTACT_271853] -CRM algorithm, with the 
goal of establishing the target dose (see below) (14, 30-32).  Section 12.1 describes the 
TITE -CRM design in detail and provides operating characteristics under several simulation 
scenarios. Section 12.2 describes the proposed analysis addressing each of the study aims.  
 In mid-2017, after the enrollment of 24 patients, the target rate of DLT was increased from 
25% to 30%.  A rate of 30% is within the normal range of target rates , particularly in this 
patient population receiving Chemo -RT in addition to the investigational agent. Data from 
all pre viously treated patients will continue to be utilized in estimating posterior 
probabilities of DLT at each dose level.  
 
12.1 Trial Design  
12.1.1  Number of Patients : [ADDRESS_331933] dose level 
exceeds 35%, in which case the trial  would be stopped early.  
12.1.2  Dose Assignment : The first patient will be treated at level 0.  Each 
subsequent patient’s dose level will be assigned using the TITE -
CRM algorithm.  When a new subject is enrolled, the probability of toxicity at each dose is estimated, based on the toxicity data accrued up to that time, using a one -parameter logistic dose- toxicity 
model described below.  The subject is assigned to the highest dose with estimated probability of toxicity closest to the target rate 
of 30% but not exceeding 35%, subject to two dose- escalation 
restrictions: (1) the dose of subject i cannot be more than one level 
greater than the dose of subject i- 1; (2) a total, over one or more 
subjects, of at least [ADDRESS_331934] can be treated at Dose j+1.  
12.1.3  Target Dose:   The target dose will be that which produces DLT at 
a frequency of 0. 30.  That is, the goal of the trial is to treat patients 
at the dose associated with DLT in 30% of patients.  
12.1.4  Initial E stimates of Probability of Toxicity: Before any subjects 
are treated, the estimated probability of toxicity at each dose level 
is given in the following table. The sensitivity of operating 
characteristics of the trial (number of toxicities, quality of esti mation 
of target dose) to these estimates is assessed by [CONTACT_271858].

rescaled dose values, and true probabilities of toxicities used in 
Monte Carlo simulations (p d1-pd3) of TITE -CRM trials.  
 
12.1.5  Dose- toxicity function: A continuous, monotonically increasing 
function relating treatment dose to the probability of toxicity is 
employed to allow subjects’ experience at any dose to contribute to  
the estimation of the probability of toxicity at all doses.  The function 
is an approximation to the true state of nature; the trial estimates 
are robust against misspecification of this function.  This trial will 
use a logistic dose- toxicity model:  
 p(DL T|d)=exp(3+α•d rs)/(1+exp(3+α•d rs)), 
 
Dose escalation trial of Wee1 inhibitor    
 26 
where α, the dose- toxicity parameter, is to be estimated, and td is 
the rescaled dose, calculated from the initial estimate of probability 
of toxicity (pd), assuming α=1.  
12.1.6  Estimation of p(DLT|d): The prior distribution o f the dose- toxicity 
parameter, α, is Gaussian, with mean [ADDRESS_331935] i is represented by [CONTACT_271859] (di, yi, wi), where di denotes the dose the subject received, yi the response (0=no DLT, 1=DLT) and wi the weight (per section 12 .1.7 below) derived from 
the portion of the approximately 105- day observation period the 
subject has completed at the given time, or, if the subject has 
experienced DLT, 1.  The expectation of α can be calculated using 
a straightforward univariate numerical integration, and is 
implemented in a SAS code that has been  used in a number of 
trials.   
12.1.7  Observation Period: Observation for DLT (as defined in Section 
9.4) will begin on the first day of treatment, and continue until an 
assessment at a follow -up visit following (~day 21 of) cycle 4 (prior 
to optional cycle 5 and beyond, approximately day 105 ).  Subjects 
who are rendered unevaluable for DLT during this period for 
reasons unrelated to toxicity of treatment (e.g., disease 
progression) will not be counted towards the accrual goal, but will 
be fractionally counted in t he estimation of the probability of toxicity.  
The first cycle will be weighted more than later cycles because proportionally more DLT’s are expected during cycle 1.  The cumulative weight assigned to a subject who completes each cycle 
without DLT is given  below. Subjects who experience DLT have 
weight 1.0 regardless of when the DLT occurred.  
 
  
 
 
12.1.8  Operating Characteristics:  Operating characteristics, estimated 
by [CONTACT_271860], are presented below.  The primary goal of the simulations is to check the design robustness 
against the misspecification of the dose- conditional probability of 
toxicity.  For this presentation, 1000 trials were simulated for each of three sets of characteristi cs (Section 12.1.5), where the true state 
of nature was as specified in the protocol (pd1), more toxic than assumed (pd2), and much more toxic than assumed, with a rapid 
increase in toxicity near the target rate (pd3).  Metrics presented include the distribution of selected target doses (a measure of 
estimation efficacy), the number of observed toxicities (a measure 
of risk) and the numbers of subjects treated at each dose (indicating 
the number of subjects treated at potentially therapeutic doses).  In 
each of the [ADDRESS_331936] dose level Day 0  Cycle 1  Cycle 2  Cycle 3 Cycle 4

is selected in greater than 70% of trials.  When the priors are far off, 
as in the case of Simulation 3, the correct dose lev el is still selected 
in more than half of all trials.  Simulation [ADDRESS_331937] state of nature, but even in this case the median 
number of DLT’s is 11 (31% of the total 36 patients).  In all three 
simulations, the average number of subjects treated at the target dose or within 1 level, is over 25, allowing for Phase IIa estimates 
of efficacy. It has been previously  demonstrated [30] that, in 
general, the TITE -CRM design is not significantly riskier (in terms 
of number of toxicities/subjects treated) than the ‘traditional’ design, while better estimating the target dose, and treating a greater number of subjects at potentially therapeutic doses.

12.2 Data Analysis plan  
 
Primary Objective : To determine the target dose and toxicity profile of AZD-[ADDRESS_331939] completed observation, 
p(DLT|d) will be calculated for each dose using the tite- CRM method (one 
parameter logistic regression model with prior distribution on the parameter alpha). 
The final estimated target dose will be the dose d with estimated p(DLT|d) closest 
to the target rate but not exceeding 35 %. To further characterize toxicity as a 
function of dose, we will use maximum likelihood to fit a two parameter logistic regression model to the data from this trial. This more flexible model typi[INVESTIGATOR_271843] -CRM estimates at and near the 
target dose, but better estimates toxicity at doses further from the selected target 
dose.  The numbers of subjects treated at each dose and the numbers 
experiencing DLT will be tabulated.  Toxicities at each dose level will be tabulated, 
categorized by [CONTACT_271861], possibly, probably or definitely 
related to treatment.  Toxicities not considered dose limiting may also be 
summarized in this manner and modeled as a function of dose level.   
 
Secondary Objective  1: To estimate the efficacy of this regimen (combined with 
standard systemic therapy) at the targe t dose, as determined by [CONTACT_3988]- free 
survival, overall survival, freedom from local progression and response rates. 
 Overall survival (OS), progression -free survival (PFS) and freedom from local 
progression (FFLP) will be summarized by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier curves and characterized 
by [CONTACT_271862]. For OS, subjects alive 
at the time of last FU will be censored at that time.  Similarly,  for PFS and FFLP, 
subjects alive and without progression will be censored at the last date on which 
they were assessed for progression.  Cox proportional hazards regression models 
will be used to estimate OS, PFS and FFLP as a function of dose and possibly 
other covariates such as age or inhibition of Wee1.  Response will be assessed 
per RECIST at 4 months.  The number and proportion of patients with progressive 
disease, stable disease, partial and complete response will be calculated for each dose level and overall.  Logistic regression models will be used to model probability 
of any response as a function of dose level.  Exploratory analyses will be 
conducted to assess for any relation between Wee- 1 inhibition and efficacy 
outcomes.  
 
Although efficacy is only a secondary aim of this trial and it is not formally powered 
for efficacy, we nevertheless show that the proposed design has reasonable power to make early efficacy assessments.  Specifically, we calculate the power of the 
design to compare the observed overall survival at 1 year to that in historical control 
patients.  The estimated overall survival at 1 year in Murphy et al was 46%.  In 
each of the [ADDRESS_331940] 25 patients treated 
at the target dose +/ - 1.  Based on these numbers and a 1- sided .[ADDRESS_331941] 77% power to detect an improvement 
Dose escalation trial of Wee1 inhibitor

of 1 year survival to 65%.  In addition to aggregating survival data for patients 
treated at the target dose with those treated one dose level above or below, we 
will look for a dose response relationship using a logistic or Cox regression model.  
Based on this fitted model, we will also compare the model -estimated outcome at 
the target dose level to the historical control data.    Secondary Objective 2: To determine if Wee1 is inhibited by [CONTACT_99213]-1775 at or below 
its tar get dose (with gemcitabine or gemcitabine- radiation) in surrogate tissues.  
 
During the first or second cycle of treatment, patients will undergo 2 biopsies:  3 h 
after treatment with gemcitabine (but before AZD-1775), and on day 2  
approximately 3- 5 hours after AZD-1775.  WEE1 signaling will be assessed using 
IHC to measure phosphorylation of various markers including Cdk1 (Y15) . 
Inhibition will be quantified as the within subject change in the above markers between the two biopsy timepoints. Descriptive statistics of inhibition across 
subjects (for each marker) will be calculated and reported by [CONTACT_15994].  
Regression models of inhibition as a function of AZD-1775 dose will be fit to obtain 
smooth and efficient estimates of mean inhibition at a given dose level. In addition 
to mean inhibition, the proportion of patients with inhibition greater than 0 (i.e. positive change) or another fixed level of interest will be estimated via logistic 
regression models.  Since AZD-[ADDRESS_331942] E, Hao Y, Xu J, Thun MJ. Cancer statistics, 2009. CA

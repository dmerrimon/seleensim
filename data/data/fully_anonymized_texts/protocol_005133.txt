Specific Aims: 
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has a variety of adverse cardiometabolic consequences. This 
disorder is characterized by [CONTACT_128979][INVESTIGATOR_802940], resulting in low blood oxygen levels, frequent nocturnal arousals, and sleep architecture  
disruption. The associated daytime hypersomnolence experienced by [CONTACT_802954]. Estimated prevalence of OSA is as high 28% of the population 
(1), and the clinical entity “OSA syndrome” (OS AS), defined as OSA in conjunction with 
excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_802941] 1 of 20 adults (1). A lmost all 
cross-sectional clinic-based studies as well as population-based observational studies have 
found an association between excess body weight and OSA, and it was reported t hat 70% of 
OSA patients are overweight or obese (2). Increased weight gain and BMI are associated with 
increased odds of OSA. This is critical, since the overall prevalence of overweight and  obesity is 
~68% and 34%, respectively, in the U.S (3). As such, there is a large proportion  of the US 
population at risk of OSAS and its co-morbidities.  
Whether obesity is strictly a cause of OSAS, or if a bidirectional relationship exists betw een 
obesity and OSAS has recently come into question (4). Newly diagnosed patients have a 
greater propensity for recent weight gain compared to controls (5). Metabolic,  hormonal, and/or 
behavioral changes associated with OSAS may place patients in a condition favoring positive  
energy balance, which can lead to further weight gain or difficulty losing weight. Con tinuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP) is effective in alleviating breathing and sleep abnormalities in  
OSAS, although it is unclear whether these improvements lead to weight loss. The proposed 
study will look closely at energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI) with OSAS treatment 
to determine how CPAP affects these parameters. This will help determine i f CPAP can improve 
weight control in obese OSAS patients, and if it can be used to promote weight  loss and 
ameliorate obesity-related co-morbidities.  
The proposal is to investigate the effects of 2 mo of CPAP on EE and EI i n obese patients with 
OSAS. The proposal is a combined ambulatory and laboratory-based study. Free-living  
measures of physical activity (via waist-actigraphy), food intake (via 3-d food log), sampl ing of 
blood for appetite-regulating hormones (leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, glucagon-like peptid e-1 
[GLP-1]), lipid profile, and inflammatory markers, and body composition measurements will be  
obtained at baseline and after 2 mo of CPAP treatment. At th e start and conclusion of each 
treatment phase, patients will enter the laboratory for measures of polysom nographic sleep, 
hunger levels, and food intake (via ad libitum test meals). The objective of the propose d study is 
to determine how CPAP treatment affects energy balance in obese OSAS patien ts. The central 
hypothesis is that CPAP treatment will improve sleep architecture, which will be associated with 
improved EE, EI, cardiovascular health, and body composition. We have shown that adverse 
changes in sleep are associated with alterations in both EE and EI (6, 7). Specifically, red uced 
sleep duration is associated with increased nocturnal and 24-h EE (6). Moreover, we observed 
that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is inversely related to hunger, and that  both REM sleep 
and slow wave sleep (SWS) are inversely related to intake of fat and carbohydrate (7).  
Aim 1 (Cardiovascular health): To determine the effects of 2 mo of CPAP compared to  pre-
treatment baseline on body composition in obese OSAS patients. 
Hypothesis 1: CPAP will reduce blood pressure, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, inflamma tory 
markers, and percent body fat relative to baseline. 
Aim 2 (Energy intake): To determine the effects of 2 mo of CPAP compar ed to pre-treatment 
baseline on hunger, food intake, and the hormonal regulation of food intake in obese OSAS 
patients. 
Hypothesis 2: Hunger levels and ad libitum food intake will be lower in patients afte r CPAP  vs. 
baseline. 
Hypothesis 43: Abnormally high leptin levels will be reduced in CP AP vs. baseline. Levels of 
ghrelin (hunger signal) will be reduced, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1; satiety sign al) 
increased, after CPAP  vs. baseline. 
 
Research Strategy 
Significance 
Importance of the problem to public health: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorde r 
characterized by [CONTACT_128979][INVESTIGATOR_802942],  due to 
narrowing or closure of the upper airway. The prevalence of OSA is stated to be  as high as 28% 
of the population (1). This is critical, since there are many cardiometabolic consequence s of 
sleep-disordered breathing-related hypoxia, including hypertension (8), coronary  artery disease 
(9), stroke (1), systemic inflammation (2), dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (10), insulin resist ance (2), and 
increased overall mortality (11). Upper airway collapse results in repeated arousals during the 
night and fragmentation of sleep, and subsequently, significant reductions in slow wave sl eep 
(SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are observed in OSA patients (12). A 
consequence of these reductions in restorative sleep is excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (EDS), 
which, when present with OSA, defines the clinical entity OSA syndrome (OSA S). OSAS is 
estimated to occur in up to 5% of the adult population, with another 5% having undiagn osed 
OSAS (1).  
 
Obesity is considered a leading risk factor for the development of OSA. Inde ed, ~70% of OSA 
patients are obese, and OSA occurs in ~45% of obese individuals (2). Rising rates of 
overweight and obesity suggest that OSAS prevalence will also be on the rise in the near future. 
An improved understanding of how OSA and its treatment affect energy balance is ther efore 
important from a global public health perspective.  
Obesity is mainly the result of an imbalance between energy intake (EI) and energy expenditure 
(EE), wherein EI is increased relative to EE, or EE is reduced relative to EI . Interestingly, not 
only is obesity a risk factor for OSA development, but OSA itself seems to play a role in further 
weight gain (4). It has been reported that newly diagnosed OSA patients h ave a history of 
significant weight gain over the year prior to diagnosis (5), and the presence of  OSA attenuates 
the effects of a weight loss intervention otherwise effective in non-OSA obese cont rols (13). 
Reasons for this are still uncertain, but OSA may predispose to positive energy balance. I n 
terms of EE, EDS in OSAS is associated with reduced daytime physical activity (PA ) (14). 
Conversely, increased 24-h EE has been reported in patients vs. controls (15). While it may 
seem that the increase in daily EE would prevent the development of a positive energy balance 
in OSA, it was proposed that the metabolic costs of sleep disruption are likely to trigger a set of 
compensatory neuroendocrine adaptations aimed at increasing hunger, reducing satiety, and 
stimulating food intake (16). In this way, it is possible that increased EE is overcompen sated for 
by [CONTACT_802955]. Indeed, evidence suggests a dysregulation of appetite-regulating 
hormones in OSA. Abnormally high levels of leptin (satiety signal) have be en documented in 
OSA, suggesting a leptin resistance to levels beyond what is already seen in obesity (17). Th e 
appetite-stimulatory hormone ghrelin is also observed to be higher in OSA patients compared  to 
non-OSA obese controls (17), suggesting that high EI may be present in OSA pa tients. EI has 
not been systematically studied in OSAS, but severity of sleep-disordered breathing was 
associated with increased preference for calorie-rich foods high in fat and carbohydrate in 
children (18).  
The gold standard in OSA treatment is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPA P 
applies mild pressure through a nose mask to prevent occlusion of the upper airway during 
sleep (19). Clinical studies in OSA have demonstrated improvements in a variety of ou tcomes in 
response to CPAP. By [CONTACT_802956][INVESTIGATOR_802943], CPAP r educes 
sleep fragmentation and arousals (12) and increases the expression of SWS and REM sleep 
(15, 20). Daytime hypersomnolence is also alleviated by [CONTACT_24102] (21). An effect on some energy 
balance-related parameters has also been demonstrated, as CPAP was shown to reduce 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_88158] (15), and to normalize leptin and ghrelin to levels seen in obese non-OSA control s 
(17). This suggests that treating OSAS with CPAP may lead to impr ovements in appetite and 
food intake. Whether long-term CPAP treatment results in weight loss in obese O SA patients is 
still unclear, as weight loss has been shown to occur in some (22-24), but not othe r CPAP 
intervention studies (25-27).  
Ramifications of proposed study for public health: Results of the proposed study will determine 
how CPAP treatment in obese OSAS patients affects energy expenditure and in take, as well as 
body composition and cardiovascular health. This information is significant because it wi ll clarify 
the factors which contribute to the increased propensity for weight gain and cardiovascular 
disease in these patients, as well as determining which aspects of energy balance regulation 
are improved by [CONTACT_802957]. CPAP is considered the first-line treatment f or OSAS, and 
weight loss has also been promoted as the best nonmedical method for reducing the symptom s 
and overall prevalence of this disorder (1). Understanding how the components of energy 
balance and cardiovascular risk are affected by [CONTACT_802958]. This could include efforts to promote weight loss and improve 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], sleep quality, and daytime functioning in this population by [CONTACT_802959].   
Research Design:  
Study participants: Men and women, age 18-[ADDRESS_1108462] udy. Participants will 
be overweight, with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2.  However, in order to exclude patients who are at the 
highest risk patients with an AHI > 50 will be excluded from participati on (45). Patients will not 
currently, or have previously been treated with CPAP. Once a diagnosis of OSAS  is made and a 
CPAP prescription is given, but before the start of CPAP treatment, we wi ll meet with potential 
participants to inform them of the study details. Those interested will be gin the screening phase, 
followed by [CONTACT_802960]. A second group of  
participants who are diagnosed with OSA but do not choose to undergo CPAP will be studied, 
as a control group.  
Participants will be excluded if they are currently taking any anti-psychotic med ications, or 
hypnotics and other drugs to treat insomnia. Individuals with uncontrolled severe (stage 2) 
hypertension (blood pressure > 160/100 mmHg) or anemia will be excluded. Participants wit h 
uncontrolled severe hypertension will be considered as individuals with known severe 
hypertension who are not actively receiving medical or drug treatment to manage t his disorder. 
Anemia will be defined from medical history.  Habitual drivers, commercial drivers and 
individuals with any recent near-miss or prior car crashes due to excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] 
(i.e. high-risk drivers) will be excluded. Premenopausal women will be studied in t he laboratory 
during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle, to exclude the possible confoundi ng effects 
of sex hormones on outcome parameters like sleep, EE, hunger, and food intake. Participa nts 
will be excluded if they have a history of coronary artery disease, transient ischemi c attack, or 
stroke.  
Study Design Overview: This study will investigate the effects of CPAP on  EE and EI in obese 
patients with moderate- to-severe OSA and EDS. Following pre-experimental baseline 
measures, including a 1-d inpatient testing period at the CTSA at Columbia University  Medical 
Center, participants  will be instructed to use CPAP at home each night through out the 2 mo 
treatment phases. After the 2 mo treatment phase, participants will under go a repeat of baseline 
procedures including assessments and the 1- d inpatient testing period. Procedures for the non-
CPAP control participants will be the same, with the exception that they will not be using CPAP 
during the 2-mo period.  
Experimental Procedures: Anthropometric measures including height, weight, neck-  and waist 
circumferences, and body composition via air displacement plethysmography will be taken at 
baseline before the start of CPAP treatment.  A urine pregnancy test to confirm the absence of 
pregnancy will be administered to female participants before scanning. Height and weight will be 
used to calculate BMI. In addition, a baseline fasting blood sample of 12 ml will be obtained to 
assay for levels of appetite-regulating hormones (leptin, ghrelin, GLP-1), lipid profile,  fasting 
glucose, and inflammatory markers (c-reactive protein [CRP], tumor necrosis factor- α [TNF - α], 
interleukin-6 [IL-6]). Blood pressure will also be measured at this time via sphygmomanomet er. 
Questionnaires filled out during this baseline period will include the ESS,  a questionnaire 
measuring daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (50), and the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire 
(FOSQ), to assess quality of life in disorders of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (51). The ESS is an 
established metric that asks patients to rate their chances of dozing/falling asl eep in 8 different 
situations. A score > [ADDRESS_1108463] of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_802944] (51). Ambulatory measures 
of PA, food intake, and sleep will be taken  during a baseline 1-wk period before the start of the 
intervention. Free-living PA will be measured with a waist-mounted accelerometer  (ActiLife 5, 
ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) (52). A sleep-wake log will be filled out daily for 1 wk, for subjective 
estimates of sleep continuity measures, including total sleep time (TST), sleep effici ency (SE), 
and sleep onset latency (SOL). Patients will be asked to wear the accelerometer on their wrist at 
night, to provide objective measures of sleep quality and continuity (53), including TST, SE, and 
SOL. Food intake will be measured with a 3-d food log (54), filled out on 2 wee kdays and 1 
weekend day.  
During the baseline assessment before treatment, patients will enter the labor atory at the CTSA 
at Columbia University for a 1-d period. Patients will arrive at ~0900 h and will r emain in the 
laboratory for the following 24h. Patients will fill out questionnaires assessing  their level of 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_802945]. A Likert scale will assess 
current energy level each hour spent awake (“How energetic do you feel right now?”; “H ow 
sluggish do you feel right now?”) and a Likert scale will assess current feelings of hunger (“How 
hungry do you feel right now?”), satiety (“How satisfied do you feel right no w?”; “How full do you 
feel right now?”), and appetite/food preferences (“How much would you like to eat  something 
sweet right now?”; (“How much would you like to eat something salty right no w?”; (“How much 
would you like to eat something savory right now?”; How much would you like to eat 
fruits/vegetables right now?”).  
Ad libitum EI will be measured during the laboratory day for each treatment ph ase. During the 
laboratory day, participants will self-select their food intake. Participants wil l have access to a 
specified food budget for the day (up to $55.50) to purchase foods and beverages of their  
choice. Participants will be escorted by [CONTACT_802961]. Participants will also have the oppor tunity to 
purchase food from take-out restaurants throughout the day. The only restrictions that will be 
imposed are that nutrient information must be available for the items purchase d and that 
beverages must be nonalcoholic. Participants will not be able to keep any food not consumed  
during the experimental day. Participants will not be allowed to take any purchased  foods home 
with them. Energy and macronutrient intakes will be calculated using Diet Analysis Plus 
Software using the weight (pre – post intake) and nutritional information of the food consumed. 
Patients will have a fixed sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_367638] 2300-[ADDRESS_1108464]-treatment follow-up, CPAP will be used. Overnigh t sleep will be 
recorded via PSG during the sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_802946] a portable sleep system. Th e 
recording montage will include electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, electromyogram, 
electrocardiogram, nasal and oral airflow via thermistor, and oxygen saturation via pulse 
oximetry, and 30-sec epochs of sleep will be scored for sleep staging (Stage 1, Stage  2, SWS, 
REM sleep), wakefulness, arousals, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_802947] (67). 
Patients will be discharged after awakening from the laboratory sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
Upon completion of the baseline 1-d inpatient visit, patients will return home f or the [ADDRESS_1108465] 4 h/night for ≥ 70% of the nights (i.e. 64 nig hts) (55). 
Participants will also complete a daily CPAP compliance form, in which they will document the 
duration of CPAP use for the prior night. We will also do random checks of compliance duri ng 
the 2 mo period. Only compliant patients will undergo the in-lab testing at the end of the 
intervention period. During the final week of the intervention phase, free-li ving ambulatory 
measures of PA (waist-actigraphy), food intake (3-d food log), and subjective (sleep-wake  log) 
and objective (wrist-actigraphy) sleep will be taken, as described above. In-lab testing will be 
done with the CPAP equipment. At the conclusion of the 2-mo treatment phase, all study 
procedures and measurements will be repeated. This will include questionnaires, fasting  blood 
sample, anthropometry including BodPod, and the 1-d inpatient period. Procedures f or the non-
CPAP patients will be same during ambulatory and lab visits. The non-CPAP pa tients will not 
use any CPAP during the intervening 2-mo period.  
Statistical Procedures: 
Sample size estimates are for paired-samples, two-tailed level of significance at 0.05 and 80% 
power, and are based on prior studies showing a significant effect of CPAP vs.  baseline on 
outcomes of interest. We hypothesize that reduced sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_802948]-living PA compared to sham. We expect to be able to 
detect an effect size of 1.[ADDRESS_1108466] Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_802949] (37) wit h [ADDRESS_1108467] previously demonstrated a relationship between REM sleep and SWS with 
hunger and food intake (7). We expect to be able to detect an effect size of 1.01 for RE M sleep 
increases (43) and 1.64 for SWS increases (43) with [ADDRESS_1108468] size of 0.736 for decreased leptin with 17 pati ents (62). To have 
power to detect changes in leptin, we will recruit 25 patients, assuming a 30% drop-out rate. 
Change-from-baseline will be calculated for single-measure parameters that are assessed at 
the  pre-experimental baseline, and after the 2- mo experimental phase (including ESS, FOSQ, 
PA, blood samples, body composition, blood pressure). Paired-samples t-tests will be used t o 
compare single-measure parameters that are assessed during laboratory phase 1 and 
laboratory phase 2. These will include polysomnographic sleep measures (sleep stages and 
indices of sleep-disordered breathing), and total energy and macronutrient intakes. Repeated or  
continuously measured parameters taken during laboratory phase [ADDRESS_1108469] repeated measures ANOVA (factors: condition x tim e). These will 
include hourly measures of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (SSS), and appetite-satiety ratings. Non-parametric 
equivalent tests will be used if data are deemed to be not normally distributed. Sign ificance will 
be set at p<0.05.

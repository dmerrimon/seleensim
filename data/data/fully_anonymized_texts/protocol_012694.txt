Summary Addressing Specific FDA CRF 21 Sec 312.30 Protocol Amendments: (b) Changes in a 
protocol. 
This is a second revised protocol with minor changes replacing our prior Amended Protocol, 
"RBC Survival in Adults with Prior Antibody Res onse to BioRBCs" (BB-IND [ADDRESS_274176] 27, 2012 and its revision submitted July 19, 2016 as Serial 
iNumber 0016). Our goal as indicated below for this Phase [ADDRESS_274177] 
detectable 2.0 µg/mL BioRBC density ("BioRBC-2")-t hat we have been validating this past 
year-followed with subsequent progressive increases in BioRBC doses administered every 10-
[ADDRESS_274178] who received a single BioRBC dose of 2 µg/mL (results included below). In the 
cmTent #001 7 submission we propose a single minor modification of Protocol #[ADDRESS_274179] BioRBC doses in a single co-administration of both together to 
previously BioRBC sensitized adults, i.e., rather than as two se arate low BioRBC doses 
separated by 10 to 28 d. As indicated in the Rationale section below, we anticipate that his 
inor modification emains a potentially safer protocol than administering all five BioRBC 
doses (i.e., BioRBC-2, -6, -18, -54, and -162) at a single time because: 
(i)A lower total BioRBC dose is likely possible because the design of the protocol has
been changed such that instead of the previous plan in our 2012 protocol amendment to
give all five autologous BioRBC density doses in a single BioRBC transfusion (i.e., 2,
6, 18, 54, and 128 µg/rnL all at once), the amended protocol calls for giving each of the
five BioRBC density doses one at a time in rogressively increasing density doses-
ow with the exception of the two lowest BioRBC density doses (2.0 and 6.0 µg/rnL) 
which will be co-administered at the same time. 
(ii)Although no new antibody testing procedure will be added to our previous [ADDRESS_274180] developed improvement in this assay (1).
This modification is being concunently submitted to our IRB. Our initial FDA Amended 
Protocol was approved by [CONTACT_227576] 2012. 
A more complex Hypothesis (revised for #0017) that incorporates our latest observations. Upon 
re-exposure to autologous BioRBCs, adults who initially experienced an induced anti-BioRBC 
antibody response will demonstrate an anarnnestic immune response; the threshold for this 
response may be at densities as low as BioRBC-6, or even -2. However, the resultant anti­
BioRBC antibodies will not accelerate removal of the lowest BioRBC densities, i.e., BioRBC-2 
and -6. Thus, this hypothesis tacitly invokes two immunological thresholds: 1) one threshold for 
the initiation of an anarnnestic BioRBC antibody res onse; and 2) a second distinct and likely

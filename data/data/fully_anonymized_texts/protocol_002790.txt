ABSTRACT  
 
The outcome for children with high grade gliomas (HGG) remains poor despi[INVESTIGATOR_439125]-modal 
therapy with surgery, radiation therapy (RT) and ch emotherapy. Although RT does prolong survival slightly, 
adjuvant chemotherapy has had little impact on surv ival in children with high grade gliomas. CCG 945 
showed no improvement in survival for patients tr eated with the 8-in-1drug regimen compared to the 
CCNU/vincristine/prednisone regimen. Five year progr ession-free survival (PFS) was 19% ± 3%, while those 
who did not have a GTR had a 5 year PFS of 11% ± 4%.[ADDRESS_556627] additive activity with radiation in human glioblastoma cells.
2-6 Hence, 
the current proposal will study these three agents’ roles as  radiosensitizers.  This study will be done in three 
parts: an initial feasibility study within the phase II part which will determine the dose of vorinostat that is 
safe and tolerable in combination with radiation therapy fo r patients less than 22 years of age; a phase II part 
that will employ a randomized “pi[INVESTIGATOR_323763]” approach  to determine if either of 2 experimental treatment 
arms (bevacizumab or vorinostat du ring chemoradiotherapy), have a higher nominal 1-year event-free 
survival (EFS) than the de facto standard treatment  arm (temozolomide during chemoradiotherapy); and a 
randomized phase III part  where patients will be random ized to either the chosen experimental arm or the 
temozolomide arm for a formal efficacy (EFS) compar ison. EFS, PFS, and overall survival (OS) on each 
treatment arm will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves. All phases of this study, including the feasibility phase, will be available to all COG institutions. Vori nostat will be administered at a starting dose of 230 
mg/m
2/dose and, if proved to be safe, will be the dose us ed in subsequent phases of the study. Descriptive 
statistics will be used to investigate molecular and biologic markers and their associations with treatment 
outcome.

2.0 BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 High Grade Gliomas  
The outcome for children with high grade gliomas remains poor despi[INVESTIGATOR_439125]-modal therapy with surgery, radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy. Although RT does prolong time to progression slightly, 
adjuvant chemotherapy has had little impact on su rvival in children with high grade gliomas.  
 
The first prospective, randomized study in pediatrics was conducted by [CONTACT_2005]’s Cancer Group (CCG) in [ADDRESS_556631] surgical treatment and ra diotherapy. Following surgical therapy, patients were 
assigned randomly to radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy consisting of chloroethyl-cyclohexyl 
nitrosourea (CCNU), vincristine (VCR), and prednisone. In this initial study (CCG 943), 5-year event-free 
survival (EFS) was 46% for patients in the radiotherapy  and chemotherapy group, and 18% for patients in the 
radiotherapy only group. Five-year survival was si milarly improved. In patients with glioblastoma 
multiforme (GBM) and at least a partial resection, the benefit from chemotherapy was clear with a 5-year 
progression free survival (PFS) of 42% for patients in the radiotherapy and chemotherapy group and 6% for 
patients in the radiotherapy only group (P =0.001). Five-year overall survival (OS) in this same subgroup was 
36% for patients in the radiotherapy and chemotherapy group vs 5% for patients in the radiotherapy only group. Patients whose initial surgery was limited to bi opsy and patients with basal ganglia lesions also had 
significantly worse outcome.
7  
 
Based on the CCG 943 trial, CCG 945 randomized patients to receive an 8-in-1 drug regimen or the 
CCNU/vincristine/prednisone regimen (control arm) . Between 1985 and 1990, 85 patients were randomly 
assigned to the control arm and 87 patients were assigned to the experimental (8-in-1 drug) regimen. CCG 945 showed no improvement in survival for patients treated with the 8-in-1 drug regimen compared to the CCNU/vincristine/prednisone regimen. Five year PFS was 33% and 5-year OS was 39% in the experimental 
group (8-in-1) compared to a PFS of 26% and OS of 29% in the control group. Those who did not have a 
GTR had a 5-year PFS of 11% (± 4%)
1.  
 
Five-year PFS for patients with anaplastic astrocytom as (AA) was 28% (SE=7%) a nd for patients with GBM 
was 16% (SE=17%). A stepwise Cox li fe-table regression analysis identified independent predictors of 
improved PFS as a 90% or greater resection of tumor ( P<0.02), AA histology ( P<0.01) and female sex 
(P<0.01).  
 Patients with centrally reviewed AA and a 90% or greater resection had a median time to progression of 31 
months, compared with a median time to progression of 12 months in those with less than a 90% resection. For the GBM group, the extent of resection only conferre d a modest advantage in terms of survival with a 
median time to progression of 12 months vs 8 months.  
 
Interestingly, the patients in the control arm in CCG 945, who were treated with prednisone, lomustine, and 
vincristine (PCV), did not demonstrate the same P FS advantage as those treated with adjuvant PCV 
chemotherapy in the CCG 943 study. Five-year PFS in CCG 943 for the chemotherapy arm was 46% vs

Page 13 26 (±8%) for the CCG 945 control arm. An updated centralized review of the pathology based on the WHO 
criteria conducted retrospectively confirmed the benef it of the addition of chemotherapy in patients with 
confirmed GBM treated on CCG 943.  
 
CCG 9933 (1993-1998) evaluated the efficacy of 3 differe nt chemotherapy regimens prior to radiotherapy. 
Seventy six evaluable patients were randomized to receive 4 courses of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) 
prior to RT. The chemotherapy regimens included etoposide with carboplatin OR ifosfamide OR cyclophosphamide. Patients then went onto receive RT followed by [CONTACT_439201]. Objective responses to 
the chemotherapy regimens ranged from 8%-27%. Five-year EFS was 8% (±3%) with an OS of 24% (±5%). 
There was no difference among the response rates of the HDCT regimens; the relapse rate during HDCT was 
30%. Twenty nine percent experienced severe non-hematological toxicities.
8 
 
POG 9135 was a phase III study that randomized patien ts between pre-irradiation cisplatin and BCNU or 
vincristine and cyclophosphamide. The 5-year survival  of 20% for the cisplatin/BCNU arm was better than 
the 5% 5-year survival rate for those treated with vincristine and cyclophosphamide ( P<0.05).9 
 Based on the adult study by [CONTACT_439202],

irradiation with concurre nt temozolomide followed by [CONTACT_167733] 200 mg/m2 daily for 5 days every 28

2.[ADDRESS_556632] RT in all arms  
Malignant gliomas are highly vascularized and inf iltrative tumors. They are dependent on endothelial cell 
proliferation regulated by [CONTACT_439203], such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 
which is the dominant angiogenic mediator in high grade gliomas.12,[ADDRESS_556633] inhibited the growth of GBM in a xenograft model.16 
 
2.2.1 Bevacizumab  
Bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, San Francisco, CA) is a vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF)-specific recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody.  The antibody was generated by [CONTACT_439204] a murine ne utralizing antibody (A4.6.1) into the framework of 
normal human immunoglobulin G (IgG1). Bevacizumab binds directly to all four VEGF isoforms (VEGF
121, VEGF 165, VEGF 189, and VEGF 206) with high affinity and specificity and inhibits VEGF from 
binding to its receptors.  In preclinical studies and clinical studies in adul ts, bevacizumab has induced stabilization and in some 
cases regression of tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
17-20 Bevacizumab has also been 
shown to potentiate the cytotoxic effects of chemothe rapy and radiation in a number of different adult 
tumor types, including colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.21 Bevacizumab has been 
approved by [CONTACT_7214] (FDA) for usage for first- or second-line treatment in combination with chemotherapy in a dults with colorectal carcinoma. 
 
The safety of bevacizumab has been evaluated in a number of adult clinical trials. The most significant 
adverse events include hypertension, proteinuria, thrombosis and bleeding. Hypertension is the most common Grade 3/4 toxicity reported. Grade 3 hype rtension (requiring more than one drug or more 
intensive therapy than prev iously) occurs in approximately 10%-20% of study subjects.  Reports of Grade 
4 hypertension (hypertensive crisis) have been unco mmon. Asymptomatic proteinuria, across all grades, 
is frequently reported with a rare incidence of  Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome). Venous 
thrombotic events have been described in association with bevacizumab therapy; however, in large randomized studies with and without bevacizumab there does not appear to be a statistically significant

Page 14 increase in venous thrombotic events. A small but signi ficant increase in arterial thrombotic events has 
also been observed in patients receiving bevacizuma b. At-risk groups include those with a history of 
atherosclerosis and those over the age of 65.19,22,23 
 
Manageable Grade 1/2 bleeding events are commonly observed with bevacizumab therapy. The incidence of more significant bleeding (Grade 3/4) was not significantly increased in a large randomized trial for patients with metastatic colorectal  cancer treated with bevacizumab.
[ADDRESS_556634] more wound healing complications (13% versus 3%), but the difference was not statistically significant.
26 
 Schedule and dose of bevacizumab in adult trials has varied between 5 to 15 mg/kg every 2 to 3 weeks.  
Recent analysis of pharmacokinetic data from 2 phase  II adults trials (AVF0780 in colorectal carcinoma 
and AVF0757 in non-small cell lung cancer) using 2 dosing schedules, 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks and 7.5 
mg/kg every 3 weeks, respectively, determined that the overall exposure to bevacizumab was similar.  Recently, the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) comple ted a pediatric phase I study of bevacizumab in 
patients with refractory solid tumors. Three dose le vels (5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
intravenously) were studied in a total of [ADDRESS_556635] dose level. Only one Grade 3 toxicity , lymphopenia, was observed. In a limited number of 
patients, pharmacokinetic studies revealed increased serum exposure with dose. The median clearance of bevacizumab was 4.1 ml/day/kg (range 3.5-15.9), and the median half-life was 11.[ADDRESS_556636] at the N7 
position. Temozolomide reaches its peak concentrati on in 1 hour.  Food reduces the rate and extent of 
absorption.  It has an elimination half-life of 1.13hr (intraperitoneally) and 1.29hr (orally) with an oral 
bioavailability of 0.98.

The results of RTOG 0625: A Randomized Phase II Trial of Bevacizumab with either Irinotecan (CPT) or 
Dose-Dense Temozolomide (TMZ) in Recurrent Glioblastoma (GBM) TMZ 75-100 mg/m2 d 1-[ADDRESS_556638] recently been analyzed.  Sixty patients were enrolled on TMZ arm and 57 pts on CPT arm. All  
had prior radiation and temozolomide.  For the TMZ arm, 6m-PFS rate was 40% (95% CI: 27-53%); for 
the CPT arm, the 6m-PFS rate was 39% (95% CI: 26-52%).  Objective responses: TMZ arm with 1 (2%) CR, 11 (19%) PR; CPT arm with 2 (4%) CR, 13(24%) PR.   Moderate toxicity was noted: TMZ arm with 
30 (50%) grade 3, 10 (17%) grade 4, and 3 (5%) grade 5 (fatal) toxicities; CPT arm had 22(39%) grade 3, 
7 (12%) grade 4, and 3 (5%) grade 5 (fatal) toxiciti es.  The 6m-PFS surpassed the predetermined efficacy 
threshold for both arms, corroborating the efficacy of  bevacizumab and CPT and confirming activity for 
bevacizumab and protracted TMZ for recurrent/progressive GBM, even after prior temozolomide exposure.  Toxicities were within anticipated frequencies with a moderately high rate of venous thrombosis, moderate hypertension and one intracranial hemorrhage. Studies to determine the efficacy of 
bevacizumab in newly diagnosed GBM are underway. (Gilbert et al, Personal Communication) 
 The combination of TMZ and bevacizumab with or w ithout the addition of irinotecan is currently being 
tested nationally in several studi es for adults with newly diagnosed  HGG. Recently, Vrendenburg et al 
reported the preliminary results of a study using be vacizumab in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) 
and radiation therapy (XRT) followed by [CONTACT_439205], TMZ, and irinotecan for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).  125 patients received radiation therapy and TMZ at 75 mg/m
2/d beginning between 
2-[ADDRESS_556639]-craniotomy. Bevacizumab at 10 mg /kg every [ADDRESS_556640]- op. Following radiation therapy, patients re ceived 6-12 monthly cycles of TMZ at 200 mg/m2/d days 
1-5, bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg and irinotecan on da ys 1 and 15. The dose of irinotecan was 340 mg/m2 for 
patients on enzyme inducing anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (EIAED) and 125 mg/m2 for patients not on EIAED. 
Efficacy analysis is based on the first 75 patients and the toxicity analysis includes all 125 patients. The median PFS doubled on this current protocol, 14 months  vs. 6.9 months historically. The median overall 
survival has not been reached, but 56% of the patients are alive at a minimum follow-up of 18 months. In addition, 28% remain progression-free at a median follow- up of 23 months. The regimen was tolerable; [ADDRESS_556641] backbone of RT/T MZ. Bavacizumab was also given concurrently with

tolerated well among the 70 patients. Treatment deliver y characteristics were similar to the historical 
control group.30 PFS was increased from 6.9 to 14.1 months, while OS increased from 14.6 to 20.3 
months.  The authors concluded that this bevacizu mab-based regimen had promising activity for PFS 
compared to the historical control data. The treatment appeared tolerable with a toxicity profile consistent with prior bevacizumab studies.

2/d (patients with no prior craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_407253] [CSI]) or 180 mg/m2/d (prior CSI), 5 PRs and 1 CR were observed among 104 evaluable 
patients. PRs occurred in 1 of 23 evaluable patients with high-grade astrocytoma, 1 of 21 with low-grade 
astrocytoma, and 3 of 25 with medulloblastoma /primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). The CR 
occurred in an additional patient w ith medulloblastoma/PNET. The most frequent toxicities were grade 3 
or 4 neutropenia (19%) and thrombocytopenia (25%); nonhematologic toxicity was infrequent.32  
 Similar to Stupp et al’s study, ACNS0126 study used TMZ as a radiosensitizer followed by 10 cycles of temozolomide 200 mg/m
2/day x 5 days of every 28 day cycle. 107 patients with a diagnosis of anaplastic 
astrocytoma (AA), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or gliosarcoma were enrolled.  Outcome was 
compared to the results for children treated on Ch ildren’s Cancer Group (CCG) study CCG-945. Ninety  
patients were eligible (31 AA, 55 GBM and 4 other).  The three-year EFS and OS were 11 ± 3% and 22 ± 
5%, respectively. The results with temozolomide give n during radiation therapy and as adjuvant therapy 
were similar to CCG 945 (p=0.98). The three-year  EFS for AA was 13 ± 6% for ACNS0126 compared to 
22 ± 5.5% for CCG-945 (p= 0.95).  The three-year EFS for GBM was 7 ± 4% for ACNS0126 compared to 15 ± 5% for CCG-945 (p=0.77).  The two-year EFS rate was 17±5% among patients without 
overexpression of MGMT  and 5±4% among those with overexpression of MGMT (p=0.045).  
Interestingly, 1-year PFS for adults receiving TMZ chemoradiotherapy on the Stupp trial was 26.9% as 
compared to 38% for children on this study, sugges ting that the initial response and outcome for children 
with HGG treated with TMZ chemoradiotherapy is not infe rior to that in adults. (Ken Cohen, PI, personal 
communication). Although ACNS0126 did not demonstrate an improved survival for children with newly diagnosed HGG who were treated with temozolomide, the study did demonstrate comparable survival 
with less toxicity
 than in studies utilizing prior nitrosourea -based regimens.  TM Z was well-tolerated. 
Hematologic toxicity was the most common adverse even t and was self-limited.  No life-threatening acute 
toxic events occurred. (Ken Cohen, PI, personal communication) 
 Although ACNS0126 did not demonstrate an improved su rvival for children with newly diagnosed HGG 
who were treated with temozolomide, the study did de monstrate comparable survival with less toxicity 
than in studies utilizing prior nitrosourea-based regimens.  TMZ was well-tolerated. Hematologic toxicity was the most common adverse event and was self-limited.  No life-threatening acute toxic events occurred, based on its better tolerability and similar efficacy to prior nitrosurea regimens, temozolomide 
is reasonable backbone to build on for the current proposed study.  
Finally, preliminary results are available in 6 ch ildren and young adults with newly diagnosed HGG < [ADDRESS_556642] been treated with bevacizumab and TMZ during RT, followed by [CONTACT_76395],

Page 17 patient experienced a dose-modifying toxicity (grade  4 thrombocytopenia/neutropenia) attributable to 
temozolomide during chemoradiotherapy; prolonged thrombocytopenia prompted discontinuation of 
therapy.  Grade [ADDRESS_556643] possibly attributable to therapy included neutropenia (1) and 
hypertension (1).  The regimen was well-tolerated both during the chemo-RT and maintenance in children 
and young adults with newly diagnosed HGG. ( , personal communication ) 
 
Thus, based on temozolomide’s better tolerability and similar efficacy to prior nitrosurea regimens in 
children with newly diagnosed HGG, its tolerability and efficacy in combination with bevacizumab in 
both recurrent and newly diagnosed adults with HG G, and preliminary data about the combination’s 
feasibility in children with newly diagnosed HGG, we believe that the combina tion of temozolomide and 
bevacizumab is a reasonable backbone  for the currently proposed study.  
 
2.2.3 Adult Studies of the Use of Bevacizumab Combinations in HGG  
Vredenburgh et al evaluated the combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan in patients with recurrent 
advanced malignant gliomas in a phase II trial. Bevacizumab was administered at 10 mg/kg IV every 14 
days. The irinotecan dose for patients on EIACD was 340 mg/m2, compared to 125 mg/m2 for those not 
on EIACD. OR were noted in 63%, with a median progression free survival (PFS) of 23 weeks. The 6 
month PFS was 38% (34% if including only patients who had received RT more than 12 weeks prior to 
study entry. Three patients developed a DVT or pulmonary emboli and one patient had an arterial 
ischemic stroke.33 
 
Kang et al reported that, among 27 patients with recurrent HGG treated with irinotecan and bevacizumab, 6 month PFS was 46%, with a median PFS of 5.1 m onths. Median overall survival (OS) was 12.6 
months.
34  
 
Raval et al reported that 22 patients with recurrent gliomas were treated with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV 
and irinotecan 125 mg/m2 IV every 2 weeks. All but two patients had a radiographic response (2 CR +, 14 
PR +, 4 MR), with a median time to progression (T TP) of 3 months and a median OS of 4.6 months.35  
 Goli et al reported a phase II trial of irinotecan 125 mg/m
2 (for patients not on EIACD) or 350 mg/m2 (for 
patients on EIACD) and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg in [ADDRESS_556644] 
36 patients were treated with irinotecan weekly and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on Days 1 and 22. The 6 
month PFS for GBM was 43% with a median PFS of 23 weeks. For Grade 3 astrocytomas, the 6 month 
PFS was 61% with a median PFS of 42 weeks. Toxicities included Grade 2 proteinuria, thromboembolic events (n=8) and CNS hemorrhage (n=1).
36  
  
Cloughesy et al reported the interim results of a randomized phase II trial using bevacizumab versus 
bevacizumab/irinotecan in patients with recurren t high grade glioma, in which 167 patients were 
randomized to receive bevacizumab 10 mg/kg (n=85) or bevacizumab 10 mg/kg + irinotecan 125 mg/m2 
over 90 minutes (n=82), (or irinotecan 340 mg/m2 in patients receiving EIACD) every 2 weeks. The 
median number of months of therapy was 16.1 months  for bevacizumab alone versus 22.2 months for the 
bevacizumab/irinotecan combination. Six month PFS was 35.6% for bevacizumab (ORR=21.2%) and 
51% for bevacizumab/irinotecan (ORR=34.1%), based on independent radiological review.37  
 Friedman et al 
29reported the results of a study that evaluated the efficacy of bevacizumab, alone and in 
combination with irinotecan, in pati ents with recurrent glioblastoma in a phase II, multicenter, open-label, 
noncomparative trial. One hundred sixty-seven patient s were randomly assigned to receive bevacizumab 
10 mg/kg alone or in combination with irinotecan 340 mg/m2 or 125 mg/m2 (with or without concomitant 
enzyme-inducing antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006], respectively) onc e every [ADDRESS_556645] page of this document.

Page 18 Secondary end points included safety and over all survival. In the bevacizumab-alone and the 
bevacizumab-plus-irinotecan groups , estimated 6-month progression-free survival rates were 42.6% and 
50.3%, respectively; objective response rates were 28 .2% and 37.8%, respectively; and median overall 
survival times were 9.2 months and 8.7 months, resp ectively. There was a trend for patients who were 
taking corticosteroids at baseline to take stable or decreasing doses over time. Of the patients treated with 
bevacizumab alone or bevacizumab plus irinotecan, 46.4% and 65.8%, respectively, experienced ≥ [ADDRESS_556646] common of which were hypertension (8.3%) and convulsion (6.0%) in the 
bevacizumab-alone group and convulsion (13.9%), neutropenia (8.9%), and fatigue (8.9%) in the bevacizumab-plus-irinotecan group. Intracranial hemorrhage was noted in two patients (2.4%) in the 
bevacizumab-alone group (Grade 1) and in three pa tients (3.8%) patients in the bevacizumab-plus-
irinotecan group (Grades 1, 2, and 4, respectively). The authors concluded that bevacizumab, alone or in 
combination with irinotecan, was well tolera ted and active in recurrent glioblastoma.  
 Based on data from adults with recurrent high-grade gliomas, summarized above, the Food and Drug 
Administration recently approved the use of be vacizumab in patients with recurrent GBM. 
 
 
2.2.4 Pediatric Studies of the Use of Bevacizumab Combinations in HGG  
Recently Gururangan et al completed a phase II study of bevacizumab and irinotecan in patients with 
recurrent high grade glioma and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) through the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium. Thirty four eligible patients were  enrolled on study; 31 were evaluable. These 31 
patients received a median of two courses of bevacizumab plus irinotecan (range, 1 to 19). There were no sustained responses in either stratum. Median time to  progression for all 34 eligible patients enrolled was 
127 days for MG and 71 days for BSG. Progression-free survival rates at 6 months were 41.8% and 9.7% 
for MG and BSG, respectively. Toxicities related to bevacizumab included grade 1 to 3 fatigue in seven 
patients, grade 1 to 2 hypertension in seven patients,  grade 1 CNS hemorrhage in four patients, and grade 
4 CNS ischemia in two patients. The mean diffusion ratio decreased after two doses of bevacizumab in 
patients with MG only. Vascular permeability parameters did not chan ge significantly after therapy in 
either stratum. Inhibition of VEGFR-2 phosphorylatio n in PBMC was detected in eight of 11 patients 
after bevacizumab exposure. The authors concluded that although the regimen was well-tolerated, the combination of bevacizumab and ir inotecan lacked efficacy in pati ents with recurrent HGG or DIPG.

Preliminary results are available in 6 children and young adults < 30 years of age with newly diagnosed 
HGG treated with bevacizumab and TMZ during RT, followed by [CONTACT_76395], temozolomide and irinotecan in a study at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213029]. Results are summarized in Section 
2.2.2.  2.3 Rationale for Randomization dur ing Initial Chemoradiotherapy 
 2.3.1 Rationale for Arm A: Vorinostat (SAHA) During Radiation Therapy
 
Chinnaiyan et al39 showed that pre-treating U373, a malignant glioma cell line, with 0.75-1 μM of 
vorinostat for 48-72 hours, and continuing vorinos tat with radiation significantly increased its 
radiosensitivity. This report and another relate d study of vorinostat in a melanoma cell line7 identified that 
vorinostat treatment and radiation significantly reduc ed DNA repair proteins in the non-homologous end-
joining (NHEJ; Ku70, Ku80, DNA-PK) and homologous recombination repair (HRR; Rad51) pathways. Since radiation is thought to exert its anti-tumor  effect by [CONTACT_193388]-stranded DNA (dsDNA) 
breaks, and dsDNA breaks are repaired by [CONTACT_439206], it has been hypothesized that 
radiation-enhancement by [CONTACT_439207] i nhibitors is partly mediated by [CONTACT_439208]. In all the pre-clinical studies, optimal radiation enhancement was observed when HDAC inhibition preceded radiation by 24-[ADDRESS_556647] page of this document.

Page 19 Rationale for HDAC Inhibitors as Radiosensitizers 
The basal unit of chromatin is the nucleosome. Nucleosomes are composed of 146 BP of DNA wrapped 
around a protein core formed with histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), which have a lysine-rich 
amino-terminal tail.[ADDRESS_556648] atus of histones alters the net char ge and chromatin structure, thus 
affecting gene expression.46  
 
Two classes of enzymes are involved in determining the acetylation of histones: histone acetyltransferases 
(HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs).47 Acetylation of histones is as sociated with transcriptional 
activation, whereas histone deacetylation is associated with transcriptional repression.48  
 
Deregulated Acetylation in Cancer 
Deregulation of histone acetylation has been implicated in the development of several types of cancer. Genes 
that encode HAT enzymes are translocated, amplifie d, overexpressed and/or mutated in various cancers.[ADDRESS_556649] been linked to histone acetylation.49 The 
carboxy-terminal domain (BCRT) of BRCA1 is asso ciated with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. 
Thus, mutated BCRA1 may compromise HDAC recruitment and lead to hereditary breast cancer.50 Several 
leukemogenic transcription factors repress the expression of specific genes because of aberrant recruitment of 
HDACs.45 This repression of gene expression is an important step in the leukemogenic action of these 
transcription factors.51-54 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M2 disease is associated with an (8,21) 
translocation that leads to the formation of a poten t dominant transcription re pressor, AML1-Eto fusion 
protein, via HDAC recruitment leading to lymphoid oncogenic transformation.55,[ADDRESS_556650] also been shown to markedly suppress the growth of a range of pediatric solid tumor 
xenograft models including neuroblastoma,59 Ewing’s and undiffe rentiated sarcoma.[ADDRESS_556651] of vori nostat in six glioblastoma and one endothelial cell lines 
in vitro. In addition, one glioblastoma cell line (U87MG) was used in in vivo short term (14 days) and 
survival studies in an orthotopic human glioma athymic mice model. Tumor volume, apoptosis rate, 
microvessel density, and proliferation index were determ ined by [CONTACT_9064]. Vorinostat treatment 
inhibited the growth of all cell lines in concentrations ranging from 1 μM to 30 μM. For short-term studies, 
histological analysis showed an 80% reduction of tumor volume in the treatment group ( P < 0.001). This 
reduction in tumor volume was associated with a significant increase in the apoptosis rate (31.9%, P < 0.001), 
a significant decrease in both th e proliferation rate (36.8%, P < 0.001) and angiogenesis rate (30%, P < 0.05). 
For survival studies, the mean survival time was [ADDRESS_556652] of vorinostat on growth of GBM cell lines and explants by 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium br omide. Changes of the cell cycle and relative gene 
expression were detected by [CONTACT_74064]-activated ce ll sorting, real-time reverse transcription-PCR, and 
Western blotting. After glioma cells were implanted in th e brains of mice, the ability of vorinostat to decrease 
tumor growth was studied. Proliferation of GBM cell line s and explants were inhibited in vitro by [CONTACT_188758] 
(ED50, 2 to 20 μ M, with 5-day exposure). Vorinostat exposure of human U87 and T98G glioma cell lines, 
DA66 and JM94 GBM explants, as well as a murine GL26 GBM cell line resulted in an increased 
accumulation of cells in G2-M of the cell cycle. Many proapoptotic, antiproliferative genes increased in their expression (DR5, TNFalpha, p21WAF1, p27KIP1), and many antiapoptotic, progrowth genes decreased in 
their levels (CDK2, CDK4, cyclin D1, cyclin D2) as measured by [CONTACT_5203]-time reverse transcription-PCR and/or 
Western blot after these GBM cells we re cultured with vorinostat (2.5 μM, 1 day). Chromatin 
immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_439126] 3 on the p21(WAF1) promoter was markedly increased by [CONTACT_188758]. In vivo murine experiments suggested that vorinostat (10 mg/kg IV, or 100 mg/kg IP) could cross the blood-brain barrier as shown by [CONTACT_439209]-H3 and acetyl-H4 in 
the brain tissue. Furthermore, the drug significantly ( P < 0.05) inhibited the proliferation of the GL26 glioma 
cells growing in the brains of mice and increased their survival. Studies of the activ ity of the HDAC inhibitor, 
vorinostat, in combination with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_439127] (imatynib mesylate, all-trans retinoic 
acid) or synergistic (radiation therapy, fla vopi[INVESTIGATOR_106540]) activity in transformed cell lines.

Eyupoglu et al demonstrated that treatment of four glioma cell lines (U87MG, C6, F98, and SMA-560) with 
MS-275 significantly reduced cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(90), 3.75 μM). Its 
antiproliferative effect was corroborated using a bromode oxyuridine proliferation assay and was mediated by 
G(0)-G(1) cell cycle arrest (i.e., up-regulation of p21/WAF) and apoptotic cell death. Implantation of 
enhanced green fluorescent pr otein-transfected F98 glioma cells into slice cultur es of rat brain confirmed the 
cytostatic effect of MS-275 in a dose escalation up to 20 μ M.62 
 
Finally, Hockly et al showed that vorinostat can cross the blood brain barrier in an R6/2Hd mouse model of Huntingdon’s chorea and increases histone acetylation in the brain.

combination studies,79,[ADDRESS_556655] explored the mechanisms of ra diosensitization by [CONTACT_439210].83,84 Recent publications report that HDAC inhibitors 
suppress repair of DNA double-strand breaks 39,44,69,73,75,76,85 primarily by [CONTACT_439211]-homologous-end

For example, vorinostat and butyric acid reduce expression of both NHEJ (Ku70, Ku80 and DNA-PKcs) and 
HR (Rad 50, Rad 51) repair-related ge nes in several human tumor cell lines.39,44 The ability of HDAC 
inhibitors to impede DNA repair following radiation is reflected in several studies that explore the expression 
of phospho- -H2AX, a hallmark of DNA damage. Vo rinostat, MS-275, valproic acid, and 
depsipeptide44,73,75,76 all prolong expression of phospho- -H2AX reflecting enhanced  DNA damage following

Page 21 HDAC inhibition. Entin-Meer et al specifically examin ed the effects of combined radiation and HDAC 
inhibitor treatment on gliomas in vitro and in vivo. They found that AN-9-mediated radiosensitization is 
associated with increased expression of phospho- -H2AX within glioma xenografts, further supporting the 
conclusion that enhanced radiation-induced DNA damage  plays a role in the combined effects of AN-9 and 
radiation.  
 In all the pre-clinical studies examining the radiosensi tizing properties of  HDAC inhibitors, optimal radiation 
enhancement was observed when H DAC inhibition preceded radiation by 24-72 hours and was continued 
concurrently with radiation.   
Vorinostat: Adult Studies 
In two phase II trials, vorinostat 400 mg/day was safe  and effective with an overall response rate of 24-30% 
in refractory advanced patients with CTCL including large cell transformation and Sézary syndrome, leading 
to FDA approval recently for use in patients with CTCL.
86,87 
 
The recommended phase II dose, based on multiple pha se I studies using several different doses and 
schedules, is 400 mg PO daily. Observed C max in the 400 mg daily regimen averaged 658 +/- 439 μg/ml 
(2.67 +/- 1.78 μM), and these values exceeded the IC 50 (0.5 to 2 μ M) required in pre-clinical studies against 
malignant gliomas. Dose limiting toxicities have in cluded anorexia, fatigue, dehydration, diarrhea and 
thrombocytopenia.   Galanis et al 
88 reported the preliminary results of a phase II  trial of 68 patients with recurrent GBM who 
received vorinostat 200 mg bid x 14 days every 3 week s. Grade 3+ non-hematologic toxicity consisting 
mainly of fatigue, diarrhea and dehydration occurred in 23% of patients; Grade 3+ hematologic toxicity 
consisting mainly of thrombocytopenia occurred in 25% of patients. Patients receiving EIACD had significantly less Grade 3+  non-hematologic toxicity ( P=0.01) and Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia ( P=0.04). 
Pharmacokinetic analysis showed lower vorninostat C-max and AUC (0-24h) values and higher vorinostat-glucuronide C-max and AUC (0-24h) va lues in patients receiving EIACD. The trial met the prospectively 
defined primary efficacy endpoint at the planned interim analysis with [ADDRESS_556656] 22 patients (23%) being 
progression-free at [ADDRESS_556657]-vorinostat treatment 
samples in a subgroup of 5 surgical recurrent GBM patients who receive d vorinostat for 6 doses prior to 
surgery, showed upregulation of E-cadherin ( P=0.02), thus indicating a biologic  effect of the HDAC inhibitor 
on the glioblastoma tumors. Thus, vorinostat was well tolerated in patients with recurrent GBM. Patients on 
EIACD have less toxicity, which is likely due to increased vorinostat metabolism via glucuronidation. 
Interim efficacy analysis is indicative of antitumor activity.  
 
Recently, Ree at al reported the results of a study in which patients with gastrointestinal carcinoma scheduled 
to receive pelvis irradiation (30 Gy in 3 Gy daily fractions) received escalating doses of vorinostat 3 hours 
before each daily fraction. Among 16 evaluable patient s, grade 3 adverse events included grade 3 adverse 
events included fatigue (n=5), anorexia (n=3), diarrhoea (n=2), hyponatraemia (n=1), hypokalaemia (n=1), 
and acneiform rash (n=1). Of these, treatment-related  grade 3 events (ie, dose-limiting toxicities) were 
observed in one of six patients at vorinostat 300 mg once daily (fatigue and anorexia), and in two of six 
patients at vorinostat 400 mg once daily (two events  of diarrhea and one each  of fatigue, anorexia, 
hyponatraemia, and hypokalaemia). The maximum-tolerated dose of vorinostat in combination with palliative 
radiotherapy was thus determined to be [ADDRESS_556658] page of this document.

The pediatric single agent MTD has been established as 230 mg/m2 daily. Dose limiting toxicities have 
included thrombocytopenia, and fatigue.  
 
2.3.2 Rationale for Arm B: Temozolomide as a Radiosensitizer  
Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine prodrug that und ergoes spontaneous hydrolysis to the active metabolite 
MTIC, which methylates DNA at O6-guanine and other sites. This drug ha s excellent oral bioavailability and 
crosses the blood-brain barrier.89 Temozolomide can be given concurrent with cranial radiotherapy, with 
adults tolerating 75 mg/m2/day for up to 42 consecutive days,10,81 and children tolerating 90 mg/m2/day.82 
Advantages of protracted temozolomide include exposure to a greater cumulative amount of drug, depletion of the resistance protein methylguainine-DNA methyltransferase, and anti-angiogenic effects.
90 A large phase 
III trial showed that protracted temozolomide given concurrently with radiotherapy, followed by [CONTACT_439212] (5 days every 4 weeks), was superior to radiotherapy alone  (2 year OS: 26% versus 10%).
[ADDRESS_556659] of care for adults with GBM has been investigated in the COG trial ACNS0126. 
Preliminary results of ACNS0126 are comparable to thos e of the historical control group (CCG 945) that has 
had the best survival outcome to date among children with malignant gliomas. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_129840], the results are 
still suboptimal, which highlights the need to build upon the temozolomide regimen in an effort to improve 
outcome.  
Preclinical data also suggest that temozolomide has at least additive activity with radiation in human 
glioblastoma cells.
2-[ADDRESS_556660] additive to gamma-irradiation. Enhancement of the 
radiation response by [CONTACT_439213][INVESTIGATOR_439130]. They 
exposed 3 genetically characterized human GBM cell lines (AMC-3046, VU-109, and VU-122) to various 
single (0-6 Gy) and daily fractionated doses (2 Gy  per fraction) of gamma-irradiation. Repeated 
temozolomide doses were given before and concurrent with irradiation treatm ent. Immediately plated 
clonogenic cell-survival curves were determined for both the single-dose and the fractionated irradiation 
experiments. To establish the net effect on clonogenic cell survival and cell proliferation, growth curves were determined, expressed as the number of surviving cells. All 3 cell lines showed MGMT promoter methylation, lacked MGMT protein expression, a nd were sensitive to temozolomide. The isotoxic 
temozolomide concentrations used were in a clin ically feasible range. Temozolomide was able to 
radiosensitize 2 cell lines (AMC 3046 and VU-122) using single-dose irradiation. A reduction in the number 
of surviving cells after treatment with the combination of temozolomide and fractionated irradiation was seen in all 3 cell lines.
91  
 2.3.3 Rationale for Arm C: Bevacizumab as a Radiosensitizer
 
 
Gorski et al demonstrated that irra diation of tumor cells induced increas ed VEGF expression.   Pre-treatment 
of various tumor xenografts in vivo with anti-VEGF therapy, including U87 glioblastoma, had a greater than additive effect when combined with subsequent radiation.
92 Using the same model, Lee et al demonstrated 
that anti-VEGF mAB exposure induced  reduction of tumor vascular density and a reduction of tumor 
interstitial fluid pressure by 74%. Simultaneously, pO [ADDRESS_556661] of hypoxic conditions in this 
glioblastoma model in vivo.93 More recently, the kinetics of vascular  changes and ‘window of normoxia’ was 
investigated in orthotopi[INVESTIGATOR_439131] U87 glioblastoma in mous e brain following DC101 anti-VEGR2 
therapy.  Maximum tumor oxygenation occurred by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_556662] page of this document.
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS0822 
Page 23 Batchelor et al reported that anti -VEGF therapy normalized the tumor va sculature and alleviates edema in 
glioblastoma patients.  In their report of 16 glio blastoma patients treated with the anti-VEGF agent 
AZD2171, the onset of vascular normalization was rapid and sustainable, but reversible by 28 days following 
cessation of drug therapy.96 Gonzalez et al similarly reported the MD Anderson experience with 15 patients 
with malignant glioma, 8 of who were diagnosed with radiation necrosis .  Bevacizumab anti-VEGF therapy, 
either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, reduced radiation necrosis by [CONTACT_439214][INVESTIGATOR_439132] 8 patients demonstrated by [CONTACT_439215] 8 weeks following therapy initiation.
97 
 
Such attenuation of the effects of radiation necrosis an d brain edema may improve quality of life for patients, 
and may decrease the diagnosis of pseudo progression  (radiation-induced tumor inflammation) frequently 
noted in the first months following chemoradiotherapy in approximately 15% of patients.98,99 
 
Mohile et al conducted a study in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, who received bevacizumab 10 
mg/kg IV q 2 weeks and stereotactic intensity modula ted IMRT: 30 Gy in 5 fractions over 15 days. Twelve 
patients with HGG received a median of 5.5 cycles of  therapy. Grade 3 events occurred in 10 patients, 
including hypertension, headache, neutropenia, seiz ures, hyponatermia and hypophosphatemia. There were 
no Grade 4 or 5 events, no DLTs and no intracranial hemorrhage. Seven out of twelve patients had objective 
responses (3 CR, 4 PR). Estimated 6 month PFS was 76%. MR perfusion imaging demonstrated a decrease in 
mean perfusion values after 1 cycle of bevacizumab.100 
 
Narayana et al reported the results of a feasibility study in which 15 patients with high-grade glioma were 
treated with involved field radiation therapy to a dose  of 59.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy/fraction with bevacizumab 10 
mg/kg on Days 14 and 28 and temozolomide 75 mg/m2.101 Subsequently, bevacizumab 10 mg/kg was 
continued every 2 weeks with temozolomide 150 mg/m2 for 12 months. Changes in relative cerebral blood 
volume, perfusion-permeability index, and tumor volume measurement were measured to assess the 
therapeutic response. Thirteen patients (86.6%) comp leted the planned bevacizumab and chemoradiation 
therapy. Four Grade III/IV non-hematologic toxicities we re seen. Radiographic responses were noted in 13 of 
14 assessable patients (92.8%). Six patie nts have experienced relapse, 3 at the primary site and 3 as diffuse 
disease. One-year progression-free survival and overa ll survival rates were 59.3% and 86.7%, respectively. 
The authors concluded that the use of bevacizumab with  radiation and temozolomide in the management of 
newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma patients is feasible.   Desjardins et al presented prelimin ary results of the Duke study in which adults with newly diagnosed GBM 
or gliosarcoma received radiation therapy with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg weeks 3 and 5 of RT as well as temozolomide 75 mg/m

irinotecan, avastin q 2 weeks with temozolomide given days 1-5 of each 28 day course.102 One hundred and 
twenty five were enrolled, 119 completed RT and 6 di d not.  Toxicities during radiotherapy included: 3 grade 
4 thrombocytopenias (attributable to temozolomide), 1 grade 4 neutropenia. Non hematological toxicities ≥ 
grade 3 during RT included 2 DVT/PE, 1 stitch abscess,1 wound dehiscence, 2 seizures and 1 CNS hemorrhage (grade 2), sudden death secondary to MI (n=1). Hematological toxicities during the maintenance 
phase included 3 grade 3 thrombocytopenias, 10 grade 4 thrombocytopenia, 14 grade 3 neutropenia, 6 grade 4 neutropenia. (Please note that the myelosuppression was most likely due to temozolomide given during maintenance therapy, which will not be given in ACNS0822). Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities during maintenance therapy included: 3 DVT/PE, 3 GI toxicities, 1 rectal abscess, 1 sepsis, 1 wound 
dehiscence, 1 optic neuritis, 2 PCP, 7 patients were ta ken off study for decreased Karnofsky score or because 
of patient choice. Thus, the treatment regimen is feasib le and tolerable in adults.  One-year progression-free 
survival was reported to be 60%, with a one-year overall survival of 79%. The updated survival data for this 
trial will be presented at ASCO 2010.  Preliminarily, this regimen has doubled the median progression-free 
survival to 14 months from 6.9 months historically. ( , personal communication).

temozolomide and radiation therapy followed by [CONTACT_439205], TMZ, and irinotecan for newly diagnosed 
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). 125 newly diagnose d GBM patients were enrolled between 8/07 and 
3/09. Patients received radiation therapy and TMZ at 75 mg/m2/d beginning between 2-[ADDRESS_556664]-
craniotomy. BEV at 10 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_556665]- op. Following radiation therapy, patients received 6-12 monthly cycles of TMZ at 200 mg/m
2/d days 1-5, BEV at 10 
mg/kg and irinotecan on days 1 and 15. The dose of irinotecan was 340 mg/m2 for patients on enzyme 
inducing anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (EIAED) and 125 mg/m2 for patients not on EIAED. The addition of BEV 
and irinotecan to standard therapy doubled the median PFS, 14 months vs. 6.9 months. The median 
overall survival has not been reached, but 56% of the patients are alive at a minimum follow-up of 18 
months. In addition, 28% remain progression-free at a median follow- up of [ADDRESS_556666] udy in 7 patients with ne wly diagnosed high-grade 
gliomas or diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas < 30 years of age (4 of whom are less than 21 years of age) in a study at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_439133]. ( , personal communication). In this 
protocol, patients with HGG receive bevacizumab and temozolomide during RT followed by [ADDRESS_556667] been observed during the RT-chemotherapy period: grade 1 PTT (n=1), grade 3 inf ection with normal ANC (n=1), grade 1 anorexia

toxicities attributable to therapy have been ob served: grade 1 thrombocytopenia (n=1), grade 2 
lymphopenia (n=1), grade 1 low WBC (n=1).  2.3.4 Summary of Feasibility Study in ACNS 0822 with Vorinostat and Radiation Therapy
 
Six patients with high grade gliomas were enrolled on the feasibility study. All patients were evaluable 
for toxicity and received vorinostat 230 mg/m2/day 5 days per week for 6 weeks during RT.  No dose 
limiting toxicities were reported at this dose level of vorinostat and patients tolerated the combination of 
RT and vorinostat well.  There were no grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicities reported during the 
DLT observation period.  All patients’ pathology speci mens were centrally reviewed. There were three 
patients with GBM and three with AA.  
As part of Amendment #1, the study will re-open to the Phase II portion of the study and all future 
patients on Arm A will receive vorinostat 230 mg/m
2/day, Monday through Friday, during the chemo-
radiation phase. 
 
 
2.4 Rationale for Biology Studies 
 
2.4.1 Gene expression profiling, miRNA analysis, and SNP arrays  
Faury et al recently published data on 32 pediatric GBM (pGBM) and 7 adult GBM (aGBM) samples which 
they investigated using biochemical and transcriptional profiling. Ras and Akt pathway activation was assessed through the phosphorylation of downstream eff ectors, and gene expression profiles were generated 
using the University Health Network Human 19K cDNA  arrays. Results were validated using real-time 
polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry and compared with existing data sets on aGBM. There are at least two subsets of pGBM. One subset, associat ed with Ras and Akt pathway activation, has very poor

 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pi[INVESTIGATOR_439134], gene expression and DNA methylati on aberrations in 206 glioblastomas and nucleotide 
sequence
104 aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provided insights into the roles of 
ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, demonstrated frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase regulatory 
subunit gene PIK3R1, and provided a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data revealed a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas.  
 
Since their initial identification in lower organisms around 15 years ago, several hundred
105-108 
microRNAs (miRNAs) are now known to exist within the human genome.[ADDRESS_556669], Malzkorn and colleagues investigated the expression changes occurring in miRNAs in a cohort 
of four secondary glioblastoma patients. They f ound that increased expression of miR-9, miR-15a, miR-
16, miR-17, miR-9a, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-25, mi R-28, miR-130b, miR-140 and miR-210 and reduced 
expression of miR184 and miR 328 were associated with malignant progression in these patients’ tumors.

majority of malignant gliomas but not in normal brain tissues, it is a logical target for glioma-specific 
therapy. Telomerase adds hexameric repeats of 5'-TT AGGG-3' to the ends of telomeres to compensate for 
the progressive loss with each cell division.109,110,111  Telomerase activity, whic h is generally undetectable 
in normal somatic cells, is expressed in approximately 90% of tumors.112-114 In malignant gliomas, 
telomerase activity is very often detected.115-128 In Grade I and II gliomas, te lomerase activity is detected 
in 0% and 0% to 33%, respectively. In malignant g liomas, telomerase is pos itive in 10% to 100% of 
anaplastic astrocytomas and in 26%  to 100% of GBM. Although the ratio of telomerase-positive cells in 
gliomas varies, most of the reports show that the incidence of telomerase expression is closely correlated with the malignancy, and telomerase is detected in the vast majority of malignant gliomas. By [CONTACT_22242], 
normal brain tissues do not express telomerase activity,

Page 26 Boldrini et al examined telomerase activity by [CONTACT_336014] (TRAP) assay 
in 42 gliomas, (32 glioblastomas, 4 anaplastic astrocytomas, 4 differentiated astrocytomas, 1 oligoastrocytoma and 1 oligosarcoma). Telomerase messenger expression ( hTERT  mRNA) was 
evaluated by [CONTACT_4465]-PCR analysis in  the same group of tumors. High telomerase activity 
was detected in 21 of 42 gliomas (50%). The levels of telomerase in terms of its messenger level expression overlapped the activity; in fact, a signi ficant association between telomerase activity and 
hTERT mRNA expression was found ( P<0.0001). At univariate analysis, advanced age as well as high 
telomerase activity and hTERT mRNA levels were significant predic tors of worse prognosis regarding 
both overall survival ( P=0.007, P=0.007, and P=0.04, respectively) and disease-free interval ( P=0.008, 
P=0.008, and P=0.04, respectively). All these variables maintained a significant independent prognostic 
role in multivariate analyses. Therefore, telomerase is  expected to represent a good candidate not only for 
a useful prognostic and diagnostic ma rker of malignant gliomas, but in the future may constitute a target 
for malignant gliomas.
130    However, the generalizability of e xpression and prognostic relevance of this 
target in pediatric malignant gliomas remains to be established, and the curren t study will address this 
issue.   2.4.3 Assessment of MGMT Promoter Methylation Status in Plasma and Tumor and MGMT Protein 
Expression in Tumor  
O6-methyl-guanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair enzyme that promotes resistance of 
tumor cells to the cytolytic effects of alkylating agents such as temozolomide20,103,109,110 and possibly 
incompletely to TMZ/IRI synergy.[ADDRESS_556672] atus of CpG islands within the 
MGMT promoter.
131 MGMT promoter hypermethylation is asso ciated with a loss of transcription and 
decreased expression of MGMT.132 Tumor MGMT promoter hypermethylation is quite variable among 
pediatric malignancies; although the frequency of  MGMT promotor hypermethylation in pediatric 
patients with primary brain tumors  is unknown, there is clear evidence from the CCG-[ADDRESS_556673] an adverse outcome independent of therapeutic approach.  Because MGMT status has been analyzed by [CONTACT_439217] l techniques in previous studies, the tumor MGMT 
protein status will be assessed directly via protein expression analyses performed via 
immunohistochemical techniques as well as indirectly by [CONTACT_439218]-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays performed on tumor DNA.
103  
 2.5 Rationale for MR Perfusion and Diffusion Imaging Studies 
Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, Ba tchelor et al showed that normalization of tumor 
vessels in recurrent glioblastoma patients by [CONTACT_439219]2171 (an oral tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor of VEGF receptors ) has rapid onset, is prolonged but revers ible, and has the significant clinical 
benefit of alleviating edema. Reversal of normalizati on began by [ADDRESS_556674] page of this document.

Page 27 as long as four months. Basic FGF, SDF1alpha, and viable circulating endothelial cells (CECs) increased 
when tumors escaped treatment, and circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) increased when tumors progressed after drug interruption. This study suggests that the timing of combination therapy may be critical for 
optimizing activity against this tumor.
96 
 
T2*-weighted perfusion MRI, a method based on the rapid intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA, has 
been used for the assessment of treatment response to  antiangiogenic agents in adults with recurrent 
high-grade gliomas.135,[ADDRESS_556675] study used this  sequence in adults with 
newly diagnosed high-grade glioma and demonstr ated its usefulness to assess angiogenesis and 
microvascular leakage, two characteristics associated with the malignant potential of these tumors.
137 The 
latter study also demonstrated considerable heterogene ity of the measured parameters within regions of 
WHO grade III and IV gliomas. 
 
Hamstra et al assessed the role of diffusion magneti c resonance imaging (MRI) using a functional diffusion 
map (fDM) in providing an earlier measure to predict patie nt survival. Sixty patients with high-grade glioma 
were enrolled onto a study of intrat reatment MRI at 1, 3, and [ADDRESS_556676] predictor of patient survival at 1 year , with larger fDM predicting longer median survival 
(52.6 vs 10.9 months, P < .003); hazard ratio [HR] = 2.7; (95% CI, 1.5 to 5.9). Radiologic response (RR) at 
10 weeks had similar prognostic value (median survival, 31.6 v 10.9 months; log-rank P<.001; HR = 2.9; (95% CI, 1.7 to 7.2). Radiologi c response and fDM differed in 25% of cases. A 
composite index of response including fDM and RR provided a robust predictor of patient survival and may identify patients in whom RR does not correlate with clinical outcome. The authors concluded that with 
conventional neuroimaging, fDM provided an earlier assessment of equal predictive value, and the 
combination of fDM and RR provided a more accurate pr ediction of patient survival than either metric 
alone.
[ADDRESS_556677] enhanced –MRI (DSC-MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).  These techniques will allo w assessment of tumor size (Anatomic MRI) and estimate cellularity 
(DTI) and vascularity (perfusion).
139 Imaging techniques will be performed at a level common to many 
different scanners likely to be encountered in clinical practice.  
MR perfusion: 
T2*-weighted perfusion MRI using the rapid in travenous administration of Gd-DTPA (dynamic 
susceptibility weighted contrast enhanced –MRI  or DSC-MRI) is an imaging method that can assess 
tumor microvascularity and has been shown to correlate with tumor grade in astrocytomas
140,141 and 
treatment response to antiangiogenic agents in adults with high-grade gliomas.136 In addition, a recent 
study has demonstrated that cerebral blood volume  (CBV) measurements by [CONTACT_337156]-MRI can predict time 
to progression and survival in patients with gliomas, independent of pathologic findings.[ADDRESS_556678] enhanced T2* weighted perfusion 
technique. Evaluation of cerebral perfusion dy namics will include cerebral blood volume (rCBV), 
cerebral blood flow (CBF), and mean transit time (MTT)  of contrast through the vasculature of the tumor 
and brain parenchyma.    
Diffusion Tensor Imaging: 
Imaging of water diffusion (DTI) is an elegant tec hnique to probe brain and tumor microstructure. To 
completely define the tensor at least six non co-l inear diffusion directions are needed. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_439135] (MD), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and fractional anisotropy (FA). 
Although diffusion imaging has been investigated and sh own to be effective as a tool to differentiate 
some intracranial tumor types, results in this  regard have been mixed and overlap exists.

3.2.[ADDRESS_556691] phase of the study  will include a feasibility study component to assess 
for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and define the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of vorinostat when 
given concurrently with radiation therapy (see Experimental Schema). The feasibility study is open to all 
COG institutions. The MTD found in the feasibility st udy component will be used in all subsequent 
phases of the study. The phase II component of the study will compare 2 experimental treatments to a commonly used chemoradiotherapy arm (Arm B with  temozolomide). Upon completion of the phase II

4.2 Concomitant Therapy Restrictions  
 
4.2.1 General Restrictions fo r All Patients on Therapy  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Patients must not be receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications known to inhibit platelet function or known to selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase activity. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients should not receive coumarin-derivative anticoagulants (eg, warfarin), as prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized  Ratio (INR) were observe d in patients receiving 
vorinostat with coumarin-der ivative anticoagulants (eg,  warfarin). In general, since all patients will 
receive bevacizumab during maintenance therapy, pa tients must not be treated with anticoagulants 
including systemic thrombolytic agents, heparin, lo w molecular weight heparins, or warfarin while on 
protocol therapy, except as required to maintain patency of preexisting permanent vascular catheters.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] 
Filgrastim (G-CSF) may be used at the treating phy sician’s discretion to enhance neutrophil recovery 
when clinically indicated (eg, for culture proven bact eremia or invasive fungal infection). Routine use of 
filgrastim in clinically well patients awaiting count recovery is not recommended.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general supportive care are to be 
used as necessary. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Corticosteroid therapy is permissible only for treatment of increased intracranial pressure. The lowest dose consistent with good medical ma nagement should be used. Corticosteroids should NOT be used as 
an antiemetic due to their effect on the blood brain ba rrier. Use of corticosteroids must be documented on 
the appropriate case report form.  4.2.[ADDRESS_556694] been multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_439141] (also called  Pneumocystis jiroveci 
pneumonia ) (PCP) reported in patients receiving temozolomide, particularly when taking corticosteroids. 
For this reason, patients should receive PCP prophylaxis during treatment. However, there have been three reports of prolonged myelosuppression and death in  older adults receiving chemoradiotherapy with 
temozolomide at low-dose along with trimet hoprim/sulfamethoxazole (also called TMP/SMX, 
cotrimoxazole, Bactrim, Septra) prophylaxis. For th is reason, trimethoprim/sul famethoxazole may not be 
utilized as PCP prophylaxis durin g chemoradiotherapy in patient s receiving temozolomide as a 
radiosensitizer. Monthly inhaled or IV pentamidine or an appropriate alternative must be 
administered during chemoradiotherapy if patients are receiving temozolomide as a radiosensitizer. 
 
TMP/SMX may be used during adjuvant 5-day temozolomide. PCP prophylaxis should be discontinued 3 months after chemotherapy has discontinued.

4.3 Definitions of Dose Limiting Toxicities, M aximum Tolerated Dose, and Dose De-Escalation 
Criteria for Feasibility Study 
 
This information applies to the feasibility study onl y. For dose modifications based on toxicities during 
Phase II and Phase III of the study, refer to Section 5.0.   4.3.1 Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicities
 
Dose-limiting toxicity is assessed during chemoradioth erapy with vorinostat (ie, starting with the first 
dose of vorinostat and concluding at 2 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy) for each patient treated in the feasibility portion of this study. Dose- limiting toxicities are based on Version 4.0 of the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (C TCAE). A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP website at:  http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelo pment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
. Dose-limiting toxicities are 
defined as:  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematological DLT:  
a) Grade 3 decreased platelet count that requires transfusion therapy on greater 
than 2 occasions during radiation therapy b) Grade 4 decreased neutrophil count or decreased platelet count 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non Hematological DLT 
a) Any grade 4 non-hematological toxicity b) Any grade 3 non-hematological toxicity with the specific exception of 
i. Grade 3 nausea and vomiting of less < 5 days duration responsive to 
antiemetic therapy; 
ii. Grade 3 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) that 
return to levels that meet initial eligibility criteria within 7 days of study 
drug interruption and that do not recur upon study re-challenge with study drug iii. Grade 3 fever or infection < 5 days duration. iv. Grade 3 hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia and/or 
hypomagnesemia responsive to oral supplementation 
c) Any grade 2 non-hematological toxicity that persists for ≥ 7 days and is 
considered sufficiently medically si gnificant or sufficiently intolerable 
by [CONTACT_6754] 
d) Grade 2 allergic reactions that necessitate discontinuation of study drug will 
not be considered dose-limiting. 
e) Any Grade 2 or higher adverse event requiring interruption of study drug for > 
7 days or which recurs upon drug rechallenge. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Any Grade 2 or higher toxicity requiring interr uption of radiation therapy for > 5 consecutive days 
or 10 days total. 
 
4.3.2 Definition of Maximum Tolerated Dose
 
The dose level that has 0 or 1 DLT among th e 6 patients will be chosen as the MTD. 
 
4.3.3 Rules for Dose De-Escalation During Feasibility Portion of the Study  
The following rules will be applied during the feasibility  portion of the study. Six patients will be enrolled 
at vorinostat 230 mg/m2/dose with daily RT. If there are fewer th an [ADDRESS_556695] page of this document.
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS0822 
Page 37 dose will be de-escalated to 180 mg/m2/dose, at which level [ADDRESS_556696] a DLT, the 180 mg/m2/dose will be declared the recommended phase II dose. If 2 or 
more of the 6 patients at 180 mg/m2/dose have a DLT, the study will be amended. 
 
Upon completion of the feasibility study, the study w ill be amended for the MTD to be used in the 
remainder of the study. Patients currently on stud y will continue with maintenance therapy after 
completion of chemoradiotherapy (see Section 4.9). 
 
4.4 Description of Treatment Arms 
 
4.4.1 Treatment Arm During Feasibility Study   
As of Amendment #1, the Feasibility Study was completed. 
There will be one treatment arm during this part of  the study. Patients will receive chemoradiotherapy 
with vorinostat at the dose assigned at study enrollment (see Section 3.1.7). 
 
4.4.2 Treatment Arms During Phase II of the Study  
Patients will be randomized at study enrollment to one of the three following arms for chemoradiotherapy:  
 
Arm A
: Vorinostat at 230 mg/m2/day, orally, Monday through Friday starting on the first day of 
radiotherapy as determined in the feasibility study. Vo rinostat should be administered [ADDRESS_556697] 
week doses starting on the weekday that radiation therapy starts until Friday of that week.  
Arm B
: Temozolomide at 90 mg/m2/dose orally, started in the first week of initiation of RT on a daily 
basis continuously throughout RT (ie, 7 days a week). The 42 days of temozolomide should be given 
regardless of the end date of RT.  
Arm C : Bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg/dose IV over 90 minutes, Day 22 (± 2 day) and Day 36 (± 2 day) of 
RT. Bevacizumab should be given at least [ADDRESS_556698] 14 days between 
bevacizumab doses.   4.4.3 Treatment Arms During Phase III of the Study
 
If the one-year EFS of either treatment Arm A or treatment Arm C is superior to that of the treatment arm B with temozolomide, the study will continue to the phase III portion. In the phase III portion, patients 
will be randomized at study enrollment to one of the two following arms for chemoradiotherapy: 
 
Arm B
: Temozolomide at 90 mg/m2/dose orally, started in the first week of initiation of RT on a daily 
basis continuously throughout RT and should conti nue until the last dose of RT. The 42 days of 
temozolomide should be given regardless of the end date of RT. 
 
Superior Arm from Phase II of the Study : The treatment arm from Phase II that has a one-year EFS that is 
superior to temozolomide (either Arm A or Arm C). If neither Arm A nor Arm C is superior to temozolomide, the study will not continue to the phase III portion.

 4.5 Arm A Chemoradiotherapy with Vorinostat (Feasibility Study Only) 
As of Amendment #1, the Feasibility Study was completed. 
 
For the feasibility study only, the dose of vorinostat will be assigned at time of study entry, and will be 
one of two doses (either 230 mg/m
2/day or 180 mg/m2/day). The Arm A chemoradiotherapy course lasts 
[ADDRESS_556700] fractions. Radiation treatments should not be interrupted or delayed, except for any life 
threatening infection or severe hematological toxicity defined as ANC < 300/ L or platelets less than 
40,000/L during the course of treatment. See Sect ion 14.0 for Radiation Therapy Guidelines.  
 
Dosing should be based on actual BSA. The maximum daily dose of vorinostat is 400 mg. 
 
The therapy map described below assumes Day 1 of RT occurs on a Monday; thus Days 1-5, 8-12, etc. are Monday through Friday.  
Vorinostat
: PO 
Dose: Assigned dose at enrollment ( maximum dose 400 mg ). 
Days: 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, daily (Monday through Friday) concomitantly with radiation 
therapy. 
NOTE : Give 1 to 2 hours prior to daily RT dose.  Please see Appendix III for dosing guidelines based 
on BSA. For patients who cannot swallow capsules, see Section 6.3 for guidelines for preparing 
vorinostat suspension. Patients with BSA < [ADDRESS_556701] 5 mg (S ee section 6.3 for preparation guidelines.)   If a dose 
of vorinostat is given and radiation therapy is NOT ad ministered due to sedation or technical issues, the 
vorinostat dose should not be made up (ie, no more than 30 doses of vorinostat should be given).   
 
See Section 5.0 for Dose Modifications based on Toxicities.  
 
The therapy delivery map (TDM) for Arm A chemoradiotherapy during the feasibility study is on the next 2 pages.   Following completion of Arm A chemoradiotherapy, Maintenance chemotherapy (s ee Section 4.9) starts 
on Day 71 (29 days after the end of chemoradiotherapy) or when criteria to begin Maintenance are met (whichever occurs later).

Dose: 90 mg/m2/dose. 
Days:  [ADDRESS_556710] be given by [CONTACT_2006] 5 of radiation therapy, and continue throughout radiation therapy.  
 
NOTE : Absorption is affected by [CONTACT_439222], cons istency of administration with respect to food is 
suggested.  Preferably, administer at bedtime on an empty stom ach (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after food) 
to decrease nausea and vomiting and improve absorption.   The whole dose, even if comprised of several 
capsule sizes, should be taken at  one time at approximately the same time each day.  
 
The temozolomide dose should be rounded off to the ne arest 5 mg (round 2.5 mg down [see Appendix IV]). It 
is recommended that antiemetics be given 30 minutes prior to each temozolomide dose. If emesis occurs 
within 20 minutes of taking a given dose, then the dose may be repeated once. If emesis occurs after 20 
minutes, the dose should not be repeated. Guidelines for administration of temozolomide capsules to patients who are unable to swallow capsules are provided in Appendix VI or an oral suspension may be compounded 
(see drug monograph in Section 6.2). 
 The 42 days of temozolomide should be given regardless of the end date of RT. If a dose of temozolomide is given and radiation therapy is NOT administered due to  sedation or technical issues, the temozolomide dose 
should not be made up (ie, no more than 42 doses of temozolomide should be given).  
 
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (also called TMP/SMX, cotrimoxazole, Bactrim, Septra) should not be 
utilized as PCP prophylaxis during chemoradiothera py. Monthly inhaled or IV pentamidine or an 
appropriate alternative should be administered during chemoradiotherapy (see Section 4.2.2 above).

treatment. See Section 14.0 for Radiation Therapy Guidelines.  
 
Dosing should be based on weig ht. There is no maximum dosing. 
 
The therapy map described below assumes Day 1 of RT occurs on a Monday; thus Days 1-5, 8-12, etc. are 
Monday through Friday. 
 
Bevacizumab: IV Over 90 Minutes 
Dose: 10 mg/kg/dose  
Days: Day 22 (± 2 days) and Day 36 (± 2 days) of RT. Bevacizumab should be given at least [ADDRESS_556718] 14 days between Bevacizumab doses. A platelet count of 75,000/µL, with or 
without platelet transfusion, is required to administer bevacizumab. 
 
Note : Infuse first dose over [ADDRESS_556719] dose of bevacizumab. If infusional reactions occur, 
acetaminophen [10-15 mg/kg (max 650 mg)], diphenhydrami ne [1 mg/kg (max 50 mg)], or other medications 
may be given for symptom control and for premedication as needed. (See Section 4.2 for concomitant therapy 
restrictions.) Anaphylactic precautions should be observed during bevacizumab administration. If an infusion reaction occurs, subsequent doses of bevacizumab should be administered over the shortest period that was 
well-tolerated. Bevacizumab is incompatible with D
5W (the drug is inactivated). 
 
Special precautions:  Black box warning includes risk of gastrointestinal perforation and wound healing 
complications (fatal results have occurred). Suspend dos ing at least [ADDRESS_556720] 28 days after a major surgery (eg, organ resection, exploratory laparotomy, 
thoractomy) or 14 days after intermediate surgical proce dure (eg, paracentesis or thoracocentesis) and until the 
surgical wound is fully healed. Minor surgical procedures  (eg, biopsies, infusaport, or Broviac line placement) 
need to have fully healed and occurred > 7 days prior to initiation of bevacizumab.

Page 53 5.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR TOXICITIES 
The following dose modifications for toxicities are for use during phase II an d phase III of the study. 
Notify the Study Chair at the time of removing a patient from protocol therapy for toxicity. 
 5.1 Dose Modifications During Chemoradiotherapy   
Doses reduced due to vorinostat, temozolomide, related- toxicity will not be re-escalated, even if there is 
minimal or no toxicity with the subsequent reduction in dose. For patients receiving vorinostat or temozolomide during RT, one dose reduction is allowed. Patients who again experience dose modifying toxicity after a single dose reduction will no longer receive vorinostat or temozo lomide, but will continue 
protocol-defined therapy as planned (continue with radiation therapy and maintenance therapy).  
 
Thus, if, in the feasibility component of the study, the dose of 230 mg/m
2 of vorinostat is deemed to be 
intolerable, and a cohort of patients are enrolled at the 180 mg/m2 dose level, patients receiving 180 
mg/m2/dose will be allowed one do se reduction (to 130 mg/m2/dose) if they expe rience dose limiting 
hematological or non-hematological toxicities.   
There will be no dose reductions made for toxicity related to bevacizumab. Treatment should be 
interrupted or discontinued for certain adverse events, as described in section 5.3.For patients receiving 
bevacizumab during RT, see Section 5.3 for dose m odifications. If bevacizumab is stopped, patients 
should contine protocol-defined therapy as planned. 
 
5.1.1 Hematological Toxicities
  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] If Grade 3 decreased platelet count that requires transfusion therapy on greater than 2 occasions during radiation therapy occurs, reduce the dose of the respective study arm-specific agent as follows: 
 Reduce the temozolomide dose to 60 mg/m
2/dose (see Dosing Table in Appendix IV) 
 Reduce the vorinostat dose to 180 mg/m2/dose (or 130 mg/m2/dose if starting at the 
dose of 180 mg/m2/dose [see section 5.1, above]) 
 Hold the dose of bevacizumab 
 [IP_ADDRESS] If Grade 4 decreased neutrophil count or Grade 4 decr eased platelet count occurs, discontinue vorinostat, 
temozolomide, or bevacizumab. CBCs should be checked twice weekly until: 
 ANC > 750/μ L 
 Platelet count > 75,000/ μL (transfusion independent) 
If the counts recover to above criteria within 14  days of drug discontinuation, resume vorinostat, 
temozolomide at the reduced doses discussed in section [IP_ADDRESS]. Resume Bevacizumab at the same dose  of 10 mg/kg.  Please notify the Study Chair if counts have not recovered to the above criteria within [ADDRESS_556731] page of this document.

750/μL.  Temozolomide doses shoul d be reduced by 25% to150 mg/m2/day x 5 days for the next course, 
at the time of recovery.  Bevacizumab should be resumed at the same dose. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   
If, despi[INVESTIGATOR_439146], the ANC does not recover to ≥ 750/μL and the 
platelets to >75,000/ μL by 14 days after the planned start of the next treatment course, no further 
temozolomide should be given and the patient may continue to receive bevacizumab in subsequent courses as soon as the criteria required for subseque nt courses of therapy (see Section 4.9) are met.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  
Chemotherapy will be held for the remainder of the cycle
 if Grade 4 decreased neutrophil count (<500/ 
μL) or Grade 4 decreased platelet count (<25,000/ μL) is observed. CBCs should be checked twice 
weekly until count recovery has occurred. Chemothe rapy with bevacizumab and temozolomide may be 
restarted if platelets have recovered to >75,000/ μL and if ANC has recovered to ≥ 750/μL. Temozolomide 
doses should be reduced by 25% to150 mg/m2/day x 5 days for the next course when the criteria required 
for subsequent courses of therapy are met. Be vacizumab should be resumed at the same dose.

6.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
Drugs are listed in alphabetical order. 
 
6.1 Bevacizumab  
(rhuMAb VEGF, Avastin®) NSC#  704865    (11/08/11) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-va scular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) 
monoclonal antibody, consisting of 93% human and 7% murine amino acid sequences. The agent is 
composed of human IgG framework and murine antigen-binding complementarity-determining regions. Bevacizumab approximate molecular weight is 149, 000 daltons. Bevacizumab blocks the binding of 
VEGF to its receptors resulting in inhibition of angiogenesis.  
 
The estimated half-life of bevacizumab is approximat ely 20 days (range 11-50 days). The predicted time 
to reach steady state was 100 days in 491 patients w ho received 1 to 20 mg/kg weekly, every 2 weeks, or 
every 3 weeks. The clearance and the central volume of distribution are higher in males than females. 
Clearance was higher in those patients with a higher tumor volume.

Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR)  
for 
Bevacizumab (rhuMAb VEGF, NSC 704865)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported 
and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with  an agent using a uniform presentation of events by 
[CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset , the Specific Protocol Exceptions to 
Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with  bold and italicized 
text. This subset  of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that ar e protocol specific ex ceptions to expedited 
reporting to NCI via AdEERS (except as noted below ).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse 
Event Reporting Requirements' http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applic ations/docs/aeguidelines.pdf
 for further 
clarification.   
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF
 they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to the 
AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combi nation protocol using multiple investigational 
agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if 
expedited reporting is required.

Note: Bevacizumab (rhuMAb VEGF) in combination wi th other agents could cause an exacerbation of 
any adverse event currently known to be caused by [CONTACT_6767], or the combination may result in 
events never previously asso ciated with either agent. 
 PLEASE NOTE
:  The potential risks listed in the CAEPR w hose relationship to bevacizumab is still 
undetermined are not required by [CONTACT_439225]; however, they may be communicated to 
patients according to local IRB requirements . 
 
Effect in Pregnancy and Lactation: 
Bevacizumab has been shown to be teratogenic in rabbi ts when administered in doses that are two-fold 
greater than the recommended human dose on a mg/kg basis. Observed effects included decreases in 
maternal and fetal body weights, an increased number of fetal resorption, and an increased incidence of 
specific gross and skeletal fetal alterations. Adverse fetal outcomes were observed at all doses tested. 
Angiogenesis is critical to fetal development and the inhibition of angiogenesis following administration of 
Bevacizumab is likely to result in adverse effects on  pregnancy. It is not known whether Bevacizumab is 
secreted in human milk. Because human IgG1 is secr eted into human milk, the potential for absorption and 
harm to the infant after ingestion is unknown. 
 
Effect on Growth and Development: 
Studies of bevacizumab in animals showed a decr ease in ovarian function and abnormal bone growth. 
These and other effects of bevacizumab may potentially impair growth and development.  Abnormal 
changes in the bones after treatment with bevacizumab have been observed in young children with 
growing bones.  This side effect appeared to be reversible after the treatment was stopped, but has not 
been assessed with long-term use of the drug.

Page 64  
Formulation and Stability:  Bevacizumab is supplied as a clear to s lightly opalescent, sterile liquid ready 
for parenteral administration. Each 400 mg (25mg/mL , 16 mL fill) glass vial contains bevacizumab with 
phosphate, trehalose, polysorbate 20,  and Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon receipt, refrigerate the 
intact bevacizumab vials at 2-8°C (36-46°F). Store in  the outer carton to protect bevacizumab vials from 
light. Do not freeze. Do not shake.  Bevacizumab vials contain no antibacterial preservativ es and are labeled for single use.  Discard any 
unused portion left in the vial immediately after use.  
 
Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment and Dose Modification sections of the protocol. 
Do not administer as an intravenous (IV) push or bolu s. Prior to administration, dilute the dose in 0.9% 
sodium chloride for injection to a final concentratio n of 1.4-16.5 mg/mL. Inspecte visually for particulate 
matter and discoloration prior to administration.   
 
The chemical and physical stability of the diluted solu tion in 0.9% sodium chlo ride is 48 hours at 2°C-
30°C. From a microbiological point of view, the pr oduct should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and would normally 
not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated 
aseptic conditions. Bevacizumab is incompatible with D5W.  To ensure complete delivery of bevacizumab IV infusi on line must be flushed with 0.9% sodium chloride. 
The following are two recommended methods for flushing the line:  1. When the bevacizumab infusion is complete, while  maintaining a closed system, add an additional 
50mL of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection to the bevacizumab infusion bag. Continue the infusion until a volume equal to that of the volume c ontained in the tubing has been administered. 
2. Replace the empty bevacizumab infusion bag with a 50mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection 
and infuse a volume equal to the volume contained in the tubing.  
 Please note: the flush is not included in the total recommended infusion times. 
 Supplier: Supplied by [CONTACT_439226]. Do not use commercially available 
drug.  Agent Ordering 
NCI supplied agent   may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized designee) at each 
participating institution. Pharmace utical Management Branch (PMB ) policy requires that agent be 
shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of 
agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained.)  The CTEP assigned protocol 
number must be used for ordering all CTEP supplied in vestigational agents. The responsible investigator 
at each participating institution must be registered  with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of 
FDA form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data Form 
(IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form  (FDF). If there are several participating investigators at one 
institution, CTEP supplied investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_439297].  Agent may be requested by [CONTACT_12550] a Clinical Drug Request (NIH-986) and faxing it to the

6.2 TEMOZOLOMIDE    
(Temodar®, Temodal®) NSC# 362856        (05/10/11) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
An orally administered alkylating agent, a sec ond generation imidazotetrazine. A prodrug of MTIC, 
temozolomide spontaneously decomposes to MTIC at physiologic pH. Exerts its effect by [CONTACT_12783]-linking 
DNA. This is likely a site specific alkylation at the O6-position of guanine with some effect at the 
N7 position. Temozolomide reaches its peak concentration in 1 hour. Food reduces the rate and extent of 
absorption. It has an elimination half-life of 1.13 hr (intraperitoneally) and 1.29 hr (orally) with an oral 
bioavailability of 0.98. Total apparent body clearance is 100 mL/min/m2 and plasma elimination half-life is 
~ 100 minutes.  
 Toxicity: 
 Common  
Happens to 21-100 subjects 
out of every 100  Occasional
Happens to 5-20 subjects out 
of every 100  Rare
Happens to < 5 subjects out of every 100

 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS0822 
Page 66 140, 180, 250 mg). The capsules vary in size, color, a nd imprint according to strength. In the US, capsules 
are packaged in 5-count and 14-count bottles. In other countries temozolomide may be packaged in 5- 
count, 14-count or 20-count bottles. Temozolomide caps ules are stored at controlled room temperature. 
 
Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment and Dose Modificati ons sections of the protocol. 
 
There is a potential for medication errors involving temozolomide capsules re sulting in drug overdosages, 
which may have been caused by [CONTACT_95431]/taking the wrong number of capsules per day and/or product usage exceeding the prescribed dosing schedule. 
 
When dispensing, it is extremely important that prescr ibing and dispensing include clear instructions on 
which capsules, and how many of each capsule(s) are to be taken per day. Only dispense what is needed  
for the course, and clearly indicate how many days of  dosing the patient will have and how many days are 
without temozolomide  dosing. When counseling patients, it is important for each patient/parent to 
understand the number of capsules per day and the number of days that they take  temozolomide . It is also 
important for the patient/parent to understand the number of days that they will be off the medication.   Each strength of temozolomide  must be dispensed in a separate vial  or in its original glass bottle. Based 
on the dose prescribed, determine the number of each strength of temozolomide  capsules needed for the 
full course as prescribed by [CONTACT_099]. For example, 275 mg/day for 5 days would be dispensed as five 250-mg capsules, five 20-mg capsules, and five 5-mg capsules . Label each container with the 
appropriate number of capsules to be taken each day.  Dispense to the patient/parent, making sure each 
container lists the strength (mg) per capsule and that he or she understands to take the appropriate number 
of capsules of temozolomide  from each bottle or vial to equal the total daily dose prescribed by [CONTACT_24201]. Institutions that have the capability to dispense temozolo mide as daily doses in a blister pack 
may do so, taking specific precautions to ensure that the appropriate dose is provided and that the patient is educated to understand the daily dosing regimen.  
 For children unable to swallow the capsules whole, the oral capsules may be formulated into a suspension. 
To prepare a 10mg/mL suspension triturate the contents of ten 100mg capsules (1000mg), 500mg povidone 
K-30 and 25mg anhydrous citric acid dissolved in 1.5mL purified water in a glass mortar to form a uniform 
paste. To the paste add 50 mL of Ora-Plus® by [CONTACT_1583] a small amount, mixing, and then adding the balance. 
Transfer to a glass graduated cylinder.  Add Ora-Sw eet® or Ora-Sweet® SF to a total volume of 100mL by 
[CONTACT_439227] (Ora-Sweet® or Ora-Sweet® SF).  Rinse at least four 
times. Package in an amber plastic prescription bottle. Th e packaged suspension is stable for 7 days at room 
temperature or 60 days in the refrigerator. The suspension should be shaken well before each use. 
Procedures for proper handling a nd disposal of cytotoxic drugs should be used when preparing the 
suspension. (Trissel LA, Yanpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] Z, Koontz SE.  Temozolomide stability in extemporaneously 
compounded oral suspensions. Int J Pharm Compounding  10:396-9, 2006). 
 
Alternatively, the capsules can be opened and mixed with apple sauce or juice (see Appendix VI in the 
protocol).

 6.3 VORINOSTAT   
(Zolinza®, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA)    NSC# 701852,    (11/02/11)  
 Source and Pharmacology : Vorinostat, also known as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), is a 
histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor.  Its chemical name [CONTACT_832] N-hydroxy-N’-phenyl-octane-1, 8-diotic acid 
diamide, N-hydroxy-N’-phenyl (9CI) octanediamide.  The HDAC enzymes catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of proteins, such as histones and transcription factors.  In some cancer 
cells, there is an overexpression of HDACs or an abnormal recruitment of HDACs to oncogenic 
transcription factors causing hypoacetylation of core nucleosomal histones.  Hypoacetylation of histones is associated with a condensed chromatin struct ure and repression of gene transcription.  
 Vorinostat inhibits HDAC by [CONTACT_439228]1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 
(Class I) and HDAC6 (Class II) enzymes.  Inhibition of  HDAC activity allows for the accumulation of 
acetylated histones.  This accumulation influences the re gulation of gene expression.  In vitro, exposure of 
cultured transformed cell to vorinostat led to G1 or G2 phase cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or differentiation and demonstrated synergistic and a dditive activity in combination with other cancer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including radiation, kinase inhibitors, cytotoxic agents, and differentiating agents). The 
mechanism of the antineoplastic effect of vorinostat has not been fully characterized.  After oral administration, vorinostat is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_439147], however, administration with a high-fat meal 
resulted in a 33% increase in the extent of absorption and a 2.5-hour delay in the rate of absorption compared to the fasted state.  Vorinostat is appr oximately 71% bound to human plasma protein. It is 
extensively metabolized to inactive metabolites, primar ily by [CONTACT_439229]-oxidation. The two metabolites, O-glucuronide of vorinostat and 4-anili no-4-oxobutanoic acid are 
pharmacologically inactive. In vitro studies indicate that vorinostat is not metabolized by [CONTACT_439230] P-450 enzymes. Less than 1% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Approximately 35-52% of an oral  dose of vorinostat is excreted in the urine as the 
two major metabolites. The mean terminal half-life of vorinostat and the O-glucuronide metabolite is 
approximately 2 hours, while that of the 4-anilino-4-oxobutanoic acid metabolite it is 11 hours.   Prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and Intern ational Normalized Ratio (INR) were observed in 
patients receiving vorinostat with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants (eg, warfarin). Therefore PT and INR should be monitored when coumarin-dervative an ticoagulants are started or discontinued. When 
vorinostat was administered with other HDAC inhibitors  (eg, valproic acid), severe thrombocytopenia and 
gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported.

Page 76 9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 Statistical Design 
This is a study for patients with newly diagnosed hi gh-grade gliomas. Patients will be treated with local 
irradiation with a particular radiosensitizer, followed by [CONTACT_439234]. The study has a feasibility part to obtain the MTD of vorinostat when given concurrently with RT. Upon its successful completion, the study will open to the Phase II part where patients will be 
randomized to receive concurrent radiation with 1 of the 3 radiosensitizers: vorin ostat, bevacizumab, or 
temozolomide, and maintenance chemotherapy with be vacizumab and temozolomide. In the Phase II part, 
temozolomide is considered the control treatment; vorinostat and bevacizumab are considered experimental treatments. If at least one of the experimental treatments has a higher 1-year EFS than temozolomide in the Phase II part, the Phase III part of the study will open and the experimental treatment 
with a higher 1-year EFS between the 2 experimental treat ments will be chosen for Phase III. Phase III of the 
study will formally compare the experimental treat ment identified in Phase II to treatment with 
temozolomide. For the Phase II/III parts, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_439220] (near total 
resection or gross total resection vs. other) and histolog y (glioblastoma multiforme vs. other). More details 
on each part of the study are discussed below. 
 
The feasibility part will enroll 6 patients at 230 mg/m
2/dose with daily RT. If there are fewer than [ADDRESS_556741] 2 or more DLT in this cohort of 6 patients, we would then dose de-escalate to 180 
mg/m2 and open the cohort to [ADDRESS_556742] a DLT, this dose 
level (180 mg/m2) will be declared as the recommended Phase II dose. If 2 or more of the 6 patients at 
180 mg/m2 have a DLT, the study will be amended. The probability that a dose level will be considered 
tolerable (ie, 0 or 1 DLT among 6 patients) is 0.89, 0.66,  0.42, or 0.23 if the true rate of DLT at that dose 
level is 10%, 20%, 30%, or 40%, respectively.   
 
Upon successful completion of the feasibility part, the study will open for the Phase II part, with 108 patients 
randomized to one of the three treatments (36 patients per arm): vorinostat, bevacizumab, or temozolomide. 
At the end of the Phase II part, if neither of the [ADDRESS_556743] a higher 1-year E FS rate than that of the temozolomide arm, the 
experimental treatment with the higher 1-year EFS  rate will be chosen for further comparison with 
temozolomide. If the study continues to the Phase I II part, patients will be randomized between 2 arms: 
one control arm (temozolomide) and one experimental  arm. In the Phase III part, accrual will continue 
until 64 additional patients are random ized to each of the 2 arms.  The final Phase III comparison will 
include patients randomized to the 2 arms in both the Phase II part and Phase III part of the study. 
 9.2 Patient Accrual and Expected Duration of Trial 
Recent COG studies of patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas (HGG) include ACNS0126 and ACNS0423. ACNS0126 accrued [ADDRESS_556744] 2007; the average accrual rate after the first [ADDRESS_556745] 9 and 12 patients, the complete duration for 
the feasibility part is expected to be about 12 months. The Phase II part of the study will accrue 108 eligible 
patients which is expected to take about 2 years. One y ear of additional follow-up will be needed to evaluate 
the Phase II outcome. If the study opens to the Phase III part, we wi ll accrue an additional 128 eligible 
patients, which is expected to take about 2.4 years. Th erefore, the total accrual duration (only the time when 
the study is open to accrual), if the study continues to the Phase III part, will be about 5 years. The total study duration from study activation until the end of accrual (including evaluation periods for the feasibility/II 
parts), is expected to be about 6.[ADDRESS_556746] udy ACNS0423, 12 (10%) were deemed ineligible.  
As of Amendment #1, the accrual for the feasibility part  of the study was 6 patients and all were eligible. 
Considering a 10% rate of ineligible enrollment on th is study, the total accrual for Phase II may be up to 
120 patients and the total accrual for Phase III may be up to 142 patients.  
 
9.3 Statistical Analysis Methods 
 
9.3.1 Endpoints  
Safety and feasibility endpoints: 
 Feasibility part: DLT for vorinostat, when given concurrently with RT.   
 Phase II: toxic death, individual toxicities especially Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage, significant delay 
(> 2 weeks) in the completion of RT, and significant delay (> 2 weeks) in the start of any course 
of maintenance therapy. 
 Phase III: toxic death, indi vidual toxicities especially Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage 
 
Efficacy endpoints for Phase II/III: 
 Event-free survival (EFS), defined as time to th e first occurrence of any of the following events: 
disease progression, relapse, second maligna nt neoplasm, or death from any cause. 
 Overall survival (OS), defined as time to death from any cause. 
 Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time to the occurrence of disease progression or 
recurrence.  
 
9.3.2 Power Considerations for Phase II/III  
In the Phase II part of the study, patients are randomized to 1 of the 3 arms: 1 control arm (temozolomide) 
and 2 experimental arms (vorinostat, bevacizumab). At the end of the Phase II part, the experimental treatment with a  higher 1-year EFS rate among the [ADDRESS_556747].  
 ACNS0126 and ACNS0423 both used temozolomide and concurrent radiation therapy to treat patients 
with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas. The maintenance therapi[INVESTIGATOR_439152] 2 studies and in the 
current study are all different. Based on Nove mber 2008 data, the observed 1-year EFS (±SE) on 
ACNS0126 is 39% ± 5%; the observed 1-year EFS (± SE) on ACNS0423 is 49% ± 5%. Given these data, 
for power considerations we assume a 1-year EFS rate  of 45% for the temozolomide arm (control arm) on 
this study. For the Phase III part of the study whic h will compare the overall EFS curves for the 2 arms, 
we assume a long-term EFS rate of 15% for the temo zolomide arm, based on limited long-term data on 
ACNS0126 and long-term outcome data on an ear lier high-grade glioma protocol CCG 945.

III part.   
In the table below, the selection probabilities for arm 1 and arm 2 after the Phase II part are presented in 
columns 2 and 3. For example, if the 1-year EFS rate s for arm 1 and arm 2 are 60% and 40% respectively, 
the probability that the study will cont inue to the Phase III part with ar m 1 is 0.85. On the other hand, if 
the 1-year EFS rate for arm 1 is 60% but the 1-year EF S rate for arm 2 is 55%, th e probability of selecting 
arm [ADDRESS_556749] 60% compared  to 45% in temozolomide arm for arm [ADDRESS_556750] a 
decent probability of being selected  for the Phase III part. The probability of selecting arm 1 decreases 
with increasing 1-year EFS in arm 2.

Page 79 not be chosen. In these calculations, for the rare situation where the 1-year EFS is the same for the 2 
experimental arms and better than that of the temozo lomide arm, half of that probability is added to the 
selection probability of arm 1 and half to that of arm 2.  This simple approach means that, in the event of 
such a “tie”, we will randomly pi[INVESTIGATOR_439153]. However, we will most likely 
consider other factors, such as toxicity profiles, for tie-breaking if such a tie occurs. The probabilities of 
such a tie are so rare that they have little impact on the results presented above.   For the Phase III part, a log rank test will be perf ormed to compare the EFS between the 2 arms (100 
patients each) after a minimal of [ADDRESS_556751] between the chosen experimental arm and the 
temozolomide arm cannot be easily defined. This is because the occurrence of the Phase III part depends 
on the outcomes in the Phase II part which also involve s the non-chosen experimental arm. In addition, 
the Phase II patients are included in the Phase III comparison; their early outcomes (1-year EFS) are 
already observed and have to occur in a particular direction (experimental arm higher than temozolomide) 
for the Phase III part to happen.  In column 4 and 5 of Table 1, we illustrate the ov erall probability of establishing a significantly better 
outcome for arm 1 (or arm 2) at the end of the Phas e III with the specified log rank test in the current 
study design. For example, the success rate for arm 1 (with 60% 1-year EFS) ranges from 0.57- 0.76 if 
arm 2 has a 1-year EFS that is between 55% and 40%. The probability presented is the overall probability 
for a particular arm before the inception of the Ph ase II/III part, so is not conditional on the arm being 
chosen for Phase III. Note that if this is a standa rd Phase III comparison with the same sample size and 
other parameters, the power for th e comparison between ar m 1 and the temozolomide arm will be about 
0.84. Here, the reduction in “power” is because arm 1,  though the best of the [ADDRESS_556752] of the 3 and “wins” in the Phase II part, the 
conditional probability of its overall success given the Phase II success and Phase II outcome will be quite 
high. In Table 1, selection probabiliti es for the Phase II part are comput ed by [CONTACT_439235]. 
The overall success rates for the fi nal Phase III comparison are estimate d from simulation studies because 
the log rank test compares the entire EFS curve rather  than just 1-year EFS. To carry out the simulations, 
additional assumptions need to be made on the failure  patterns of the patients. Event-free survival curves 
are approximated by [CONTACT_439236] a proportion of the patients become long-term survivors and 
failures for the remaining patients follow an exponential pattern. The temozolomide arm is assumed to 
have 45% 1-year EFS and 15% lo ng-term EFS. The whole EFS curve under the cure model with 
exponential failure is fully specified by [CONTACT_439237] 2 time points. The differences in event free 
survival between the temozolomide arm and the experimental arm are assumed to be the same at 1 year 
and at long term, which then specify the whole EFS curves for the experimental arms.  
 9.4 Interim Monitoring  
 9.4.1 Monitoring for Toxic Death and Grade 3 or 4 Hemorrhage
 
During the Phase II part of the study, we will monitor the rate of toxic death and that of Grade 3 or 4 
hemorrhage separately for each arm during RT. In  ACNS0126, among 99 patients there were 2 deaths 
within 1 month on study, which are considered slightly attributable to the treatment. In ACNS0423, all 7 deaths which occurred during treatment or within 31 days after treatment are considered due to disease 
progression. Two incidences of Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage were reported among 105 patients during 
chemoradiotherapy on ACNS0423. Based on these data, for the current study we consider 2% the 
maximum tolerable rate for both toxic death and for Grade [ADDRESS_556753] 2 toxic deaths or 2 incidences of  Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage among the 36 patients. The 
monitoring rule will be triggered 3.5%, 37%, 56%, or  82% of the time if the true incidence is 2%, 6%, 
8%, or 12%, respectively. We will also monitor toxi c death rate and Grade [ADDRESS_556754] 4/54, 6/108 
patients experience toxic death/hemorrhage; it is satisfied 4% of the time if the true incidence is 2%, and 
80% of the time when the true incidence is 7%.  
 If the study opens to the Phase III part, the rate fo r toxic death and that for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage 
during chemoradiotherapy will be also examined fo r each arm. Among the 100 patients on each arm 
(temozolomide arm and the chosen experimental arm) , we can accept at most 4 incidences for toxic 
deaths or for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage. The ch ance that the combined rule for Phase II/III ( ≥3/36, ≥5/100) 
will be satisfied is 7% if the true incidence is 2%, and is 85% if the true incidence is 7%. The rate of toxic 
death and that for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage during the common maintenance will also be examined by [CONTACT_439238] e II or Phase III parts. We will consider the rate for toxic death or 
that for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage unacceptable if we  observe 9 or more incidences among the 236 Phase 
II/III patients. The combined rule ( ≥4/54, ≥ 6/108, ≥  9/236) will be satisfied 7% of the time if the true 
incidence is 2%; it will be met 85% of th e time when the true incidence is 5%.  
 When a safety monitoring rule is met, the study accrual will be temporarily suspended. The study 
committee will perform a careful review of the toxi city incidences, and report the results and study 
committee recommendation such as accrual suspension or therapy modification for the involved arm to 
the DSMC. DSMC also may make other recommendations based on their review of the toxicity and 
safety data at any time.   9.4.2 Monitoring for Feasibility of Each Radi osensitizer and Common Maintenance Chemotherapy
 
During the Phase II part of the study, the feasibility  of each radiosensitizer and the common maintenance 
therapy will be examined via the inci dence of significant delay (> 2 weeks) in the completion of RT and 
the incidence of significant delay (> 2 weeks) in th e start of any course of maintenance (among total 
courses combining all 3 arms). A review of treatmen t feasibility and patient safety will be undertaken 
when we observe > 10% significant delays in the comp letion of RT specifically if we observe at least 
5/18 or 8/36 significant delays. The rule will be met about 4% of the time if the true incidence of delay is 
10%, and 90% of the time if the true  incidence is 30%. Because the number of total maintenance courses 
cannot be easily estimated (as patients may not all comple te 12 courses), it is not feasible to specify the 
set of statistics-based boundaries for monitoring delays in maintenance therapy. The monitoring will be 
based on the marginal incidence of significant delay in the start of any course of maintenance observed at each interim report.  Similar review  will be undertaken if the rate of  delays during ma intenance exceeds 
10%.  
9.4.[ADDRESS_556755] will be performed to evaluate 
whether there is early compelling evidence of improvement in EFS in either experimental arm compared 
to the control arm. The monitoring boundary will be based on Lan-Demet’s method with spending function αt
2. If there is significant evidence of efficacy for either experimental arm compared to the 
control arm, the study will be referred to DSMC for c onsideration of early closure after the Phase II part

 9.5 Analysis Plans 
 9.5.1 Analysis plans for the primary aims of Phase II/III
 
We will estimate event-free survival (EFS) for pa tients on each arm by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier product-limit 
method. After the Phase II part, the experimental ar m with a higher nominal 1-year EFS will be chosen 
for further study in the phase III part if its 1-year E FS rate is also higher than that of the temozolomide 
arm. If the study opens to the Phase III part, Kaplan -Meier curves will be used to estimate EFS of the [ADDRESS_556756] that compares the EFS between the chosen experimental arm and the temozolomide arm; the cutoff value for the Z-statistics will be 1.64.  
 9.5.2 Analysis plans for Phase II/III secondary aim
 
Event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), a nd progression-free survival (PFS) will be calculated 
for patients treated with each radiosensitizer by [CONTACT_169884]-Meier estimates. Log rank tests will be used to 
compare these survival outcomes between different treatment groups on the current study.  Similar log 
rank analyses will be performed to compare outcomes fo r patients treated on the current study to those for 
HGG patients treated on previous COG protocols (ACNS0126 and ACNS0423); in particular, outcomes 
for patients on Arm B (temozolom ide) will be compared to that  for HGG patients on ACNS0126 and 
ACNS0423 to isolate contribution of bevacizumab plus  temozolomide maintenance therapy versus single 
agent temozolomide maintenance therapy and temo zolomide plus lomustin e maintenance therapy, 
respectively.  Incidence of individu al toxicities will be estimated for each chemoradiotherapy arm and for 
maintenance chemotherapy.  
 
9.5.3 Analysis plans for laboratory and imaging aims  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the biological/laboratory/imaging measures for the study, 
including telomerase activity, hTert expression, telo mere length, MGMT promoter methylation status, 
MGMT protein expression, and various measures in MR perfusion and diffusion from MR imaging. Changes in these measures across time-points (baseline, prior to maintenance therapy, prior to cycle 3 and 
after maintenance therapy) will be summarized similarl y, using descriptive statis tics on the measures that 
are collected at multiple time points. Mean and sta ndard deviation will be used to summarize continuous 
measures; log transformation of a continuous measure may be considered when appropriate. Categorical 
measures will be described by [CONTACT_439240]; in the case of binary measures a 
95% CI will be estimated. SNP analysis and gene ex pression and microRNA analysis will be carried out 
using Affymetrix software, and dChip or GCOS software respectively. Exploratory analyses to correlate a particular biological/laboratory/imaging characteristic  with survival outcomes might be performed. Log 
rank tests will be used to explore the prognostic signif icance of a categorical factor on EFS, OS or PFS. 
Cox proportional hazards models will be used to explore the effect of  a continuous marker on survival 
outcomes, and will be used for exploratory multivariate analysis examining the effect of the characteristic 
of interest with adjustments for other patient or treat ment characteristics. The power of such exploratory 
analyses examining the association of a laboratory or  imaging characteristics with survival outcomes 
depend on many factors: 1) total sample size of th e study (whether the study goes to Phase III); 2) the 
portion of patients that participate in the particular optional study; 3) the proportion of patients possessing 
the high risk characteristics (assuming a simple comparis on based on a binary risk factor); 4) the survival 
outcomes in the high-risk group and in the low-risk group. Therefore, it is difficult to prospectively 
estimate the power characteristics for individual biol ogy analysis and these analyses are exploratory in 
nature.

9.7 Gender and Minority Accrual Estimates  
The target for the feasibility part of the study was 6-12 eligible patients. As of Amendment #1, the accrual for 
the feasibility part of the study has been completed a nd was 6 patients and all were eligible. The expected 
accrual for the Phase II and Phase III parts of the study are 108 eligible patients and 128 eligible patients, 
respectively. The accrual target on the study, theref ore, is 242 eligible patients. Considering a 10% 
ineligibility rate for Phase II and Phase III, the maximum enrollment for this study may be up to 268 patients 
in order to assure that the required number of eligible patients are enrolled.      
The gender and minority distribution of the study population is expected to be:

for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response. Note that patients with 
M+ disease are not eligible for enrollment on this study. 
2. If multiple measurable lesions are present, up to  3 should be selected as “target” lesions. 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size and suitability for accurate repeated 
measurements.  All other lesions will be followed as non-target lesions (including CSF 
positive for tumor cells).   
3. The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the thickness of the slices showing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effect (e.g. 8 mm lesion for a 4 mm slice). 
4. Any change in size of non-target lesions should be noted, though does not need to be measured. 
 10.4 Response Criteria for Target Lesions  
1. Response criteria are assessed in 2 di mensions – the product of W x T.  
2. To assess response/progression, the ratio is calculated: W x T (current scan)
  
W x T (reference scan) 
 
3. Development of new disease or progression in  any established lesions is considered 
progressive disease, regardless of response in ot her lesions – e.g. when multiple lesions show 
opposite responses, the progressi ve disease take s precedence. 
 
4. Response Criteria for target lesions: 
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  
Partial response (PR) : ≥ 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two perpendicular diameters of 
target lesions, compared to baseline measurement. 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of the two perpendicular 
diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR (t aking as reference the initia l baseline measurements), 
nor sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD, (taking as reference the smallest disease measurement since the treatment started).  Progressive Disease (PD)
: ≥ 25% increase in the product of pe rpendicular diameters of ANY target 
lesion, taking as reference the smallest product observed since the start of treatment (see exception below); OR the appearance of one or more new lesion s, OR worsening neurologic status not explained by 
[CONTACT_167748] (e.g., antico nvulsant or corticosteroid toxicity, electrolyte 
disturbances, sepsis, hyperglycemia, presumed post-therapy swelling etc) PLUS any increase in tumor cross-sectional area (or tumor volume).   However, because radiotherapy may be associated with  transient, reversible swelling during or within the 
first [ADDRESS_556759]. Removing a patient from protocol therapy as soon as tumor area increases by 
25% may result in the treatment being terminated premat urely. It is quite possible that if these patients 
were maintained on protocol therapy, their disea se might eventually stabiliz e and even regress.  
 
Therefore, patients will not be considered to h ave progressive disease and will not be removed from 
protocol therapy for radiographic worsening seconda ry to local tumor enlargement (LTE), defined 
as increase in maximal bi-dimensional tumor area of 25% or more but less than 50%, and with no

Page 86 new lesions on any MRI performed within 3 months  from completion of RT (i.e. on the required 
MRI 4 weeks after completing RT, or the scan p erformed prior to cycle 3 of the maintenance).  
Thus, during and for 3 months after completion of RT , patients should only be removed from protocol 
therapy for progressive disease if there is 50% or  more increase in tumor area (with or without 
neurological worsening), OR if there is the appe arance of one or more new lesions on the MRI  outside  
the radiation port. 
 The criteria for progressive disease as defined a bove will commence with the required brain MRI scans 
done more than 3 months
 after completion of RT (i.e. prior to cycle 5 of therapy, or scans done for 
suspected progression more that 3 months after comp letion of RT).  Patients whose tumors meet these 
criteria will be removed from protocol therapy.   Local progression is defined as progression of known residual tumor or the appearance of tumor at known 
prior sites of disease that were at some point withou t evidence of disease. Distant progression is defined 
as the appearance of tumor at sites other than known pr ior sites of disease. Distant progression most often 
occurs in the subarachnoid space and may occur at any point within the neuraxis. Although rare, extra-CNS metastasis represents distant failure. Combin ed local and distant progression is defined when 
evaluation of the entire neuraxis reveals local and distant progression.  
10.5 Response Criteria for Non-target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)
: Disappearance of all non-target lesions.  
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD) :  The persistence of one or more non-target lesions.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing non-target lesions.  
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_556760] be repo rted in an expedited manner to allow for timelier 
monitoring of patient safety and care. The followi ng sections provide information about expedited 
reporting.  11.2 Determination of reporting requirements 
 Reporting requirements may include th e following considerations: 1) whet her the patient has received an 
investigational or commercial agent; 2) the char acteristics of the adverse event including the grade  
(severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and the prior experience  (expectedness) of 
the adverse event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253043].   An investigational agent
 is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug Application 
(IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.   
Use of this document is governed by [CONTACT_439195].
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS0822 
Page 87 Commercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a commercial 
source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial 
agents for a trial. 
 
When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules apply. 
 Concurrent administration : When an investigational agent is used in combination with a 
commercial agent, the combination is consid ered to be investigational and expedited 
reporting of adverse events would follow th e guidelines for investigational agents. 
 Sequential administration : When a study includes an investigational agent and a 
commercial agent on the same study arm, but the commercial agent is given for a period of 
time prior to starting the inve stigational agent, expedited re porting of adverse events which 
occur prior to starting the investigational agent would follow the guidelines for commercial 
agents.  Once therapy with the investigational agent is initiated, all expedited reporting of 
adverse events follow the investigat ional agent reporting guidelines. 
 
 11.3 Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be reported in an expedited manner 
 
Step 1
: Identify the type of event using the CTEP Versi on 4.0 of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
(CTCAE).  The CTEP version of the CTCAE v4.0 provides descriptive terminology and a grading scale 
for each adverse event listed. The CTEP version of  the CTCAE version 4.0 is  identified and located on 
the CTEP website at:  http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopm ent/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). All 
appropriate treatment locations should have access to a copy of the CTEP CTCAE v4.0. 
 
Step 2 : Grade the event using the NCI CTCAE.  
 Step 3
: Determine the attribution of adverse event  in relation to the protocol therapy.   Attribution categories 
are: Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, and Definite.  
Step 4
: Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.    
Expected events for a CTEP IND agent are de fined as those listed in the ASAEL (Agent 
Specific Adverse Event List), a subset of the CAEPR (Comprehensive Adverse Event and 
Potential Risks). For investigational agents that are not commercially available and are being studied under a company’s IND, expected AEs are usually based on the Investigator’s Brochure.   
 
Unexpected  events for a CTEP IND agent are defined as those NOT listed in the ASAEL. 
 
Guidance on expectedness of the agent is provided in the Drug Information Section of this protocol. 
 
Step 5
: Review Tables A and/or B  in this section to determine if: 
 
 there are any protocol-specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific adverse 
events that require special monitoring ; and/or 
 there are any protocol-specific exceptions  to the reporting requirements. 
 
Step 6 : Determine if the protocol treatment given prio r to the adverse event included an investigational 
agent, a commercial agent, or a combination of investigational and commercial agents.  
 
Note: If the patient received at least one dose of inves tigational agent, follow the guidelines in Table A.  
If no investigational agent was administer ed, follow the guidelines in Table B.

13.2 Definitions of Extent of Resection  
 
13.2.1 Biopsy Only  
An open surgical removal or closed (e.g. needle) removal of tissue for the sole purpose of making a 
pathologic diagnosis.  If tumor removal is less than 10 % of the total tumor mass, this will be considered a 
biopsy only. 
 
13.2.2 Partial Resection  
The surgical removal of greater than 10% but less than 50% of the tumor mass. 
 
 
13.2.3 Subtotal Resection  
The surgical removal of greater than or equal to 50% but less than 90% of the tumor mass. 
 
 
13.2.4 Near Total Resection (Extensive Subtotal Resection)  
Resection of greater than or equal to 90% of the tu mor mass, but residual disease apparent on inspection. 
 
13.2.[ADDRESS_556771]-operative 
imaging of the brain should be done within 72 hours of  surgery if possible (preferably within 24 hours of 
surgery), and prior to the onset of edema or glio sis which can make measurements of residual tumor 
difficult. If imaging cannot be obtained at this time or is difficult to interpret, the scan should be repeated 10 or more days after surgery. 
 
13.4 Peri-operative Corticosteroids  
Some patients with large tumors may require initiati on of corticosteroid therapy pre-operatively to reduce 
associated cerebral edema or improve neurologic function. 
 Usual corticosteroid dosage is 0.25 to 1 mg/kg/day of , dexamethasone in divided doses every 4-6 hours. 
Corticosteroids may be continued during the peri-operative period; however, every attempt should be made to taper and discontinue corticosteroid therapy as soon as clinically feasible (7 days). 
 13.5 Special Precautions for Bevacizumab 
Black box warning includes risk of gastrointestinal perforation and wound healing complications (fatal 
results have occurred). Suspend dosing at least [ADDRESS_556772] 28 days after a major surgery (eg, organ resection, exploratory laparotomy, thoractomy) or 14 days after intermediate surgical procedure (eg, paracentesis or thoracocentesis) and 
until the surgical wound is fully healed. Minor surgi cal procedures (eg, biopsies, infusaport, or Broviac 
line placement) need to have fully healed and  occurred > [ADDRESS_556773] page of this document.

14.0 RADIATION THERAPY GUIDELINES  
 
Radiation Therapy for patients on COG protocols can only be delivered at approved COG RT facilities 
(per COG Administrative Policy 3.9).   
 
General Guidelines 
Radiation therapy will be given concurrently with  chemotherapy (vorinostat, temozolomide, or 
bevacizumab) in newly diagnosed pa tients with localized high-grade glioma. The primary site will be 
irradiated even if gross-total resection was achie ved. This study mandates the use of conformal or 
intensity-modulated radiation therapy; the use of CT-MR registration to define the target volumes, and 
electronic data submission. Given the infiltrative natu re of high-grade glioma, patients presenting with 
extensive disease and large tumor volumes may be treated with simple beam arrangements.   Required Benchmark and Questionnaires:
 
3D-conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or intensity m odulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using photons are 
required for this study. Patients may not receive proton therapy on this protocol.   Centers participating 
in this protocol using 3D-CRT are required to co mplete the 3D Benchmark; those using IMRT must 
complete the IMRT questionnaire and benchmark or phantom (see Section 14.8). All centers participating 
in this protocol must complete the QARC CT/MR image fusion benchmark. Benchmark materials and 
questionnaires may be obtained from the Quality Assu rance Review Center (www.qarc.org) and must be 
submitted before patients on this protoc ol can be evaluate d. Contact [CONTACT_174631] 
(http://rpc.mdanderson.org/rpc) for information regarding their IMRT phantoms.    Guidelines and Requirements for the Use of IMRT
 
Investigators using IMRT will be required to comply with the guidelines devel oped for the use of IMRT 
in National Cancer Institute sponsored cooperative group trials. These guidelines are available through 
www.qarc.org . These guidelines require that the protocol explicitly state their requirements and methods 
for localization and immobilization; the use of volumetric imaging; target and organ motion management; 
nomenclature, definitions and rationale for targets an d organs at risk; target volume coverage and normal 
tissue dose constraints; effects of heterogeneity in tissues; and quality assurance. 
 
14.[ADDRESS_556774] start within 31 days of the definitive surgical procedure.   
 
14.1.3 Criteria to Start Radiation Therapy  
There are no contraindications to radiation therapy. Patients taking phenytoin should be weaned and/or 
switched to a different anticonvulsant as soon as feasible.   Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are 
based on schedules derived from the experimental de sign or on established standards of care.  Minor 
unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol  directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and 
up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure and/or 
anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG Administrative Policy 5.14 (except where 
explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
Use of this document is governed by [CONTACT_439195].
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE [ADDRESS_556775] received radiation therapy prior to enrollment on this protocol. Patients who 
require urgent irradiation after prot ocol enrollment may initiate treatment using a simple beam’s eye view 
treatment approach. The treatment may then be modified to improve conformity or normal tissue sparing as 
soon as feasible.   14.3 Equipment  
 
Modality
: X-rays with a nominal energy of  4MV. In the unusual circumstance of a superficial lesion, 
electron fields may be used. Conformal and IM RT techniques are allowed in this study. Patients may not 
receive proton beam therapy on this protocol. 
 
Calibration : The calibration of therapy machines used in this protocol shall be verified by [CONTACT_217401] (RPC).  CT treatment planning: 
All patients will undergo CT treatment pl anning for this protocol. Image section 
thickness <  3mm should be taken throughout the extent of the irradiated volume. 
 
14.4 Target Volumes  
 
The International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU-50 and 62)145,[ADDRESS_556776].     14.4.1  Gross Tumor Volume 1 (GTV1)
 
 GTV1 will include all the tissues initially involved with disease and the entirety of residual tumor defined by [CONTACT_7416]-operative and post-ope rative MRI. GTV1 will include both  enhancing and non-enhancing areas 
of the tumor, MR T2-weighted imaging abnormality, and the resection bed.  The GTV1 will take into 
account changes in brain anatomy resulting from tumor resection or CSF shunting.  
 
 GTV1 is the volume of tissue containing the highest concentration of tumor cells. 
 GTV1 includes disease defined by [CONTACT_439244]. 
 GTV1 is corrected volumetrically after surgical resection. 
 GTV1 includes the pre and post-contrast MR T1 and T2 abnormality. 
  
Special Circumstances (GTV1) 
 
 The surgical corridor should not be included in  the delineation of the GTV unless suspected to 
contain tumor. 
 In cases where there is discrepancy between imaging studies or intra-operative findings, the larger volume will define GTV1. 
  
Use of this document is governed by [CONTACT_439195].

Page 97  
14.4.2  Gross Tumor Volume 2 (GTV2) 
There are several options to define GTV2. GTV2 may be  determined based on extent of resection prior to 
radiation therapy, residual enhancing or non-enhanci ng residual tumor by T1-weighted MRI or may be 
the same as GTV1 when the resulta nt PTV2 is considered by [CONTACT_439245] 5940cGy.   GTV2 Option 1 
GTV2 = post-operative tumor bed after gross-total resection. 
 GTV2 Option 2  GTV2 = residual tumor as determined by [CONTACT_094]- and post-contrast T1-weighted MRI.  GTV2 Option 3 
 GTV2 = GTV1 when the resultant PTV2 is cons idered relatively small and the treating radiation 
oncologist determines that the patient will tolerate 5940cGy to this volume. 
 14.4.3 Clinical Target Volume 1 (CTV1) 
 CTV1 is defined as the volume of tissue containing subclinical microscopic disease. 
 CTV1 for this protocol is the GTV1 with an anatomically confined margin of 2cm. 
 CTV1 should be tailored at tissue interfaces where invasion/infiltration is not likely. 
 The CTV may be manually moved inward to the inner table of the bony calvarium. 
 
14.4.4 Clinical Target Volume 2 (CTV2) 
 The CTV2 margin should be an expansion of the GTV2 to encompass microscopic disease. 
 The CTV2 for this protocol is the GTV2 with  an anatomically confined margin of 1 cm. 
 The CTV2 should be tailored at tissue interfaces where invasion/infiltration is not likely. 
 The CTV may be manually moved inward to the inner table of the bony calvarium. 
 
 
14.4.5 Planning Target Volume 1 (PTV1)  
 The PTV includes the CTV with an added margin that is intended to account for patient movement and 
set-up variability.  The treating radiation oncologist w ill select a margin between 3 and 5mm that reflects 
the appropriate set-up uncertainty and internal marg in for the individual patient and treatment facility. 
 The PTV-1 will include the CTV-1 plus a 3-5 mm margin in all dimensions.  The PTV may extend beyond bone margins, and may extend beyond the skin surface.  
The PTV-2 will include the CTV-2 plus a 3-5 mm margin in all dimensions.  The PTV may extend 
beyond bone margins, and may extend beyond the skin surface.    Motion Management and Margins to Account for Target Volume and Organ Motion
 
Considering motion of normal tissues and target volum es is important. The internal target volume (ITV) 
is defined as the CTV surrounded by [CONTACT_439246]. The planning organ at risk volume  (PRV) includes the corresponding organ at risk 
(OAR) volume surrounded by a margin to compensate for motion or physiologic change in the tissue 
volume. If adequate clinical data do not exist to de fine the IM component of the PTV or the PRV margin, 
the following suggestions are provided:  
 A margin matching the PTV margin may be added to any OAR to form the PRV.

approaches may be offered when more complex a pproaches and beam arrangements demonstrate limited 
benefit. 
 
Patient Position : Reproducible setups are critical and the use of immobilization devices is strongly 
encouraged. Use of anesthesia is permitted if  necessary for proper positioning.

 Comment – Effort should be made to avoid direct treatment of the optic nerves and chiasm without compromising target volume coverage during treatment of PTV1. In the event that the 
recommended constraints provided in this section would be exceeded as a result of treatment of 
PTV2, the treating radiation oncologist may use their discretion to reduce target volume 
coverage. 
 Structure definition – The optic nerve may be contoured on CT or MR.  The contour should appear on at least two successive CT or MR images.

15.0 NEUROPATHOLOGY GUIDELINES AND CENTRAL PATHOLOGY REVIEW 
SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS 
 
15.1 Central Review  
A retrospective central pathology review will be performed for all patients. The review outcome will not alter the patient’s status on the study. The aim of the central pathology review is to provide confirmation 
of the diagnosis and to ensure accuracy and fidelity of the data. The classification and grading of the tumors will be performed according to the WHO criteri a. The submission of pathology material shall be 
made directly from the participating institutions. Th e review pathologist may u tilize unstained sections for 
a variety of supplemental tests. The remaining slides sha ll be kept as back-up material, or shall be used to 
perform additional staining as needed.

Page 104 15.2 Specimen Handling 
Optimal and standardized evaluation of each case neces sitates handling according to the below guidelines, as 
possible: 
 
The treating institution should perform a panel of im munohistochemical (IHC) stains on the best /most 
representative block to aid in diagnostic work up. It is highly recommended that this panel include: GFAP 
(also S100, if GFAP-is weak, focal or negative appearing) Synaptophysin, Neurofilament protein, EMA, 
MIB-1 (Ki-67) and p53: Ideally, these institutional IHC stained slides could/ should be made available for 
central review. In the event all IHC stains are ne gative or IHC stain results are equivocal, electron 
microscopy, performed by [CONTACT_8236], may be of benefit if a sample was fixed for this at the time of surgery. A copy of any electron microscopy report sh ould be included with the institution's pathology report 
sent for central review, as described in 15.3. Ideally, th e institutional IHC stained s lides could/should be made 
available for central review and would be returned upon completion of review.  Solid tumor cytogenetic study results (i.e. karyotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) may also be of benefit, if sufficient sample is 
available, to be performed by [CONTACT_439249];  if a report of these results is available, it should 
also be included with the institution's pathology re port sent for central review. All tissue received by 
[CONTACT_439250], should be prepared for light 
microscopy sections.  15.[ADDRESS_556784] be received  prior to the start of maintenance.    
 Representative paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from each representative lesion.  Blocks 
will be retained at the Biopathology Center unless return is requested by [CONTACT_8236].  If blocks are unavailable, then from each
 representative block the following are REQUIRED: 
-Two H & E stained sections -Four unstained sections prepared for immunohistochemistry.    
 Institutional neuropathologist's report. (Als o include any outside consultant's report.) 
 Operative Report(s) 
 Institutional Neuropathology Worksheet

after tumor removal. Frozen tissue should be sent on dry ice to the BPC. A minimum tumor tissue of 
> 0.5 cm3 is preferred.  
 Note
:  It is recommended that the pathologist bring a liquid N2 container up to the frozen section room, so 
that if adequate tissue is available at the time of frozen section, some is immediately snap frozen at that 
time for possible COG studies and/ or tumor banking. The neurosurgeon(s) OR personnel, and Pathology lab personnel may well need to be informed/ educated regarding the importance of rapid receipt and snap freezing of tumor once removed from the patient. If there is insufficient  tumor received for rapid 
processing/ snap freezing during frozen section evaluatio n, as described above, then any subsequent parts 
of tumor removed for this purpose should still be sn ap frozen within 20 minutes of removal/ resection 
from the patient.   Frozen tumor specimens should only be dispatched on Monday through Thursday for delivery Tuesday 
through Friday to the BPC (see Section 16.2.1 for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_13386]).

Page 109 liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, GibcoBRL) according to 
the manufacturer’s recommendations. Where frozen tissue is not available, DNA extraction will be 
obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue scrolls. For normal DNA, genomic DNA will 
extracted from matched peripheral blood leukocytes using Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit 
(Promega) according to the manufact urer’s recommendations. Isolated DNA is then loaded on Affymetrix 
arrays and scanned as per the manufacturer’s protoc ol. All data analysis will be carried out using 
Affymetrix software.  
 
Expression Array Analysis 
Total RNA will be isolated from fresh frozen tumor tissue using TRIzol Reag ent (Life Technologies). 
RNA integrity will be confirmed with the Agilent 21 00 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). We will use 
HG_U133plus2 or Genechip® Human Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) for expression 
analysis. Preparation of cRNA, hybridization, sca nning, and image analysis of the arrays will be 
performed according to manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, five g of total RNA will be used to generate 
cRNA probes and combined with a mixture of contro l cRNAs (made from bacterial genes BioB, BioC, 
BioDN and CreX) before hybridization. The U133plus [ADDRESS_556791] of more than 47,000 gene probe 
sets, each representing a transcript. Each probe set consists of 16 perfectly complementary 25 base long 
probes (PMs) as well as 16 mismatch probes (MMs) that are identical except for an altered central base. 
All GeneChip images will be visually inspected for irregularities and analyzed by [CONTACT_439257].  
 
MicroRNA analysis  
Total RNA from expression array analysis (see above) w ill also be used for this study. The presence of an 
intact miRNA population will be confirmed with the Bi oanalyzer (Agilent Technol ogies). After labeling, 
samples will be hybridized to the Human miRNA Mi croarray v3 (Agilent Technol ogies, Santa Clara, CA) 
or superior version depending on what  is available at the time of sample processing. The v3 chip contains 
probes for 866 human miRNAs and 89 human viral miRNAs identified from the Sanger database v12.0.  
 16.7.3 Exploration of the prognostic significance of  MGMT and other markers of potential treatment 
resistance   
Tumor tissue will be obtained prior to starting treatmen t from consenting patients enrolled on this study to 
evaluate a series of immunohistochemical markers asso ciated with outcome in previous pediatric high-
grade glioma studies. Particular emphasis will be placed on examining MGMT expression, which has 
been associated with response to alkylator-based  therapy in the CCG-945 and ACNS0126 cohort.  
Additional markers to be examined include p53, MIB1 (a marker of proliferation status), and pAkt and 
pMAPK, growth signaling intermediat es that have been associated with an adverse prognosis in recent 
studies.103 Tumor samples (unstained slides) will be analyzed using immunoperoxidase labeling 
techniques, as previously applied in ACNS0126 and ACNS0423. In addition to assessment of MGMT 
expression using immunohistochemical methods, tumors will be identifie d in which MGMT expression is 
silenced by [CONTACT_439258]-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tumor samples. 
 
16.8 Optional Imaging Studies (MR Perfusion and MR Diffusion Tensor Imaging)  
 
Optional imaging studies will be performed only in patients with evidence of residual tumor on the 
MRI performed to determine extent of resection prior to start of therapy. 
 
For subjects who provide consent, MR perfusion and diffusion studies will be obtained at the following 
timepoints: 
1) Prior to the start of protocol therapy 
2) Prior to the start of maintenance therapy 
Use of this document is governed by [CONTACT_439195].
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS0822 
Page 110 3) Prior to cycle 3 of maintenance therapy  
4) Subsequent to completion of maintenance therapy 
 
16.8.1 Perfusion Studies:  
The EPI-GRE imaging sets will be analyzed at the ce ntralized reading location w ith an automated method 
which uses the global arterial input function with de convolution techniques to yield parametric maps of 
cerebral blood volume (CBV), flow (CBF) and mean tr ansit times (MTT) or equivalent measures using 
standard clinical software and in -house software for perfusion analysis. ROI assessment of regions of 
highest tumoral CBV compared with  contralateral hemispheric white matter will be used to establish 
rCBV ratios for baseline and follow-up purposes. 
 Perfusion:  
GRE- EPI [INVESTIGATOR_439164].  EPI [INVESTIGATOR_439165] e, FA: 35 degrees, 128 x 128 matrix, FOV = 26, 
TR: 1500 ms or less, TE: minimum. ASSET (SENSE) us e if possible. Contrast injection optimally by 
[CONTACT_44393] (1-3ml/sec) or by [CONTACT_439259].  Slice number as allowable by [CONTACT_439260].  At least 50 phases are acquired. 
 16.8.2 Diffusion Studies
: 
Diffusion weighted imaging will be performed usi ng diffusion tensor imaging. This will allow for 
quantitative analysis of tumor diffusion in areas in close proximity to normal looking brain in order to 
better estimate tumor invasiveness into adjacent white  matter as well as to assess diffusion characteristics 
of tumor tissue before and during treatment. Standard maps produced are Mean diffusivity, Fractional anisotropy, and Trace diffusion. Im aging processing will be performed at the centralized reading location 
using standard clinical software and in-house software for diffusion analysis. Region-of-interest analysis 
of tumor and peritumoral regions w ill be performed. Primary assessment  will be by [CONTACT_439261]. 
 
Diffusion Tensor Imaging: 
  DTI Imaging sequence:  12 – 25 direction (depending upon scanner) 3m m slice thickness, 
 gap:0, b=1000, 128 x 128 matrix, FOV 38.4 cm. (isotropic dataset), ASSET (SENSE) use  if possible. 
 
The optional perfusion and diffusion MR imaging will be reviewed by [CONTACT_439262], [CONTACT_439299].

 APPENDIX VI: INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADMINISTRATION OF TEMOZOLOMIDE 
(PATIENTS UNABLE TO SWALLOW CAPSULES AND CANNOT OBTAIN A SUSPENSION) 
 
 If the person giving this medicine is  pregnant or thinks she may be pregnant, she should not touch this 
medicine. 
 
Temozolomide is an anti-cancer medicine, and special precautions must be taken when handling it.  There 
is potential hazard to anyone who handles these medicines once the protective capsule is opened.  If your child cannot swallow the capsule you will be required to open the capsules and mix the contents of the 
capsule into apple sauce or apple ju ice.  This process must be done acc ording to the following guidelines 
to make sure the medicine is given safely.  
 Find a place to work that is free from drafts or  wind and is not a place where food is stored or 
prepared. 
 Cover the area with foil w ith a paper towel over it. 
 Temozolomide can be mixed into apple sauce or apple juice.   
 Put the apple sauce or apple juice into a container (or cup) that you can throw away. 
 Put on gloves and mask.  
 Open each capsule and put the powder in the appl e sauce or apple juice and give IMMEDIATELY.  
The medicine may not dissolve completely if mixing in apple juice so make sure you have extra apple 
juice to add if you need to. 
 If you need to add more juice or apple sauce, remove your gloves before touching the main food container, then place new gloves on before adding the extra juice or apple sauce to the medicine. (You do not want any medicine that may be on your gloves to get into the main food container of juice or apple sauce.).  
 You must be able to throw away anything that the medicine touches, such as the spoon used for mixing or eating the apple sauce or the cup used for juice. 
 Once all of the medicine is taken, throw away the following in a plastic bag:  medicine cup, the container the medicine was mixed in, the cover you used for the work area, mask, gloves and anything else that the medicine has touched.

(for children from 7 through 12 years of age) 
 
A Study of Adding a Drug to Treatment for Ne wly Diagnosed Brain Tumors that Grow Quickly  
 
1. We have been talking with you about your glioma .  A glioma is a type of cancer that grows in 
your brain.  After doing tests, we have found that you have this type of cancer. 
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study  because you were just di agnosed with a type of 
brain tumor that is more likely to grow fast. A research study is when doctors work together to try 
out new ways to help pe ople who are sick. This study will see if a new treatment will work better 
to shrink or get rid of the tumor than other treatment often used. 
 
3. There is no “normal” treatment for glioma tumors that grow fast. But, often an operation to take out the tumor is done. Then, high-energy x-rays are used to kill any cancer cells left in the brain. 
Many children also get anti-cancer medicines to kill the cancer cells. These treatments do not 
work very well at getting rid of the tumor. Study doctors want to see if giving a drug during the x-
ray treatments will help get rid of cancer cells. St udy doctors also want to see if giving [ADDRESS_556805] x-rays taken of your knees every 12 weeks to check how you are growing. Then you will be 
finished with the treatments.  
 
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These good 
things are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that the 
new medicine during radiation treatment will work  better to make your tumor get smaller or go 
away. Because the [ADDRESS_556806]. But, we do not know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this study. 
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These bad things are called “risks.”  The risks to you from this stud y are that you may get a treatment that is not as 
good at shrinking or getting rid of the tumor as the commonly used treatment and you may have bad health problems from the new medicine. Be cause the [ADDRESS_556807] page of this document.

7. We are asking your “okay” to collect some extra blood and pi[INVESTIGATOR_327588], and to do some 
special scans.  We want to see if there are ways to tell how the tumor will react to treatment. The 
blood would be collected when other standard blood tests are being done, so there would not be any extra needle sticks.  The tumor samples would be taken at the time you have any operation. We will not do an operation just to get pi[INVESTIGATOR_327588]. The special scans will be done when 
regular scans are done.  Yo u can still take part in this study even if you do not allow us to collect 
the extra blood or tumor samples for re search or to do the special scans.

A Study of Adding a Drug to Treatment for Ne wly Diagnosed Brain Tumors that Grow Quickly  
 
1. We have been talking with you about your glioma. A glioma is a type of cancer that grows in the 
brain .  After doing tests, we have found that you have this type of cancer.  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research st udy because you have a “high-grade” glioma. This 
means the tumor is more likely to grow quickly and to spread. A research study is when doctors 
work together to try out new wa ys to help people who are sick. This study will see if a new 
treatment will work better to shrink or get rid of high-grade glioma than a commonly used 
treatment for this disease. 
 Most children and teens with gliomas have surger y to take out the tumor and then get radiation 
therapy (powerful x-rays directed at the tumor location). Many children and teens also get chemotherapy drugs (anti-cancer medicines). Treatments for gliomas do not work very well at shrinking or getting rid of the tumor. Study doctors want to see if giving chemotherapy during 
radiation therapy will work better than radiation therapy alone to get rid of the tumor. They also 
want to see if giving two chemotherapy drugs afte r radiation therapy will help get rid of the tumor 
for as long as possible. 
 3. Children and teens who are part of this study will be treated with a drug called vorinostat during 
the time radiation treatments are given, for [ADDRESS_556808] x-rays taken of your knees 
to check how you are growing.  
 4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These good things are called “benefits.”  We hope that a benef it to you of being part of this study is that the 
new drug given during radiation treatment will be better at shrinking or getting rid of the tumor 
than the commonly used treatment. We hope that the new combination of drugs given after radiation treatment will work better to shrink or get rid of the tumor than the commonly used treatment. However, we do not know for sure if ther e is any benefit of being part of this study. 
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These bad things are called “risks.”  One risk to you from this study is that you may have side effects from the combination of radiation therapy with the vorinos tat. Some possible side effects include things 
like being very tired, an upset stomach, and not being able to keep food down. Another risk to you is that you may have more side effects fro m the [ADDRESS_556809] page of this document.

If you receive the commonly used drug during radiation treatment, the risk to you is that you ma y receive a treatment that  is not as good as the 
new treatment at shrinking or getting rid of your tumor. There is the risk that the new treatment 
given after radiation treatment will not work as well as the common treatment to shrink or get rid 
of the tumor, and you may have more side effects from the [ADDRESS_556823] page of this document.

PART 1 – Feasibility Study of Vorinostat with Radiation Therapy 
 
If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child who may take part in this study, permission from 
you is required. The assent (agreement) of your child may also be required. When we say “you” in this consent form, we mean you or your child; “we” means the doctors and other staff. 
 
WHY ARE YOU BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? 
 
This study is called a clinical trial. A clinical tr ial is a research study involving treatment of a 
disease in human patients. This study is or ganized by [CONTACT_63779]’s Oncology Group (COG). COG 
is an international research group that conducts clinical trials for children with cancer. More than 
[ADDRESS_556841] been diagnosed with 
a type of brain tumor called a high-grade glioma. A “high-grade” glioma is a tumor that grows 
fast and is more likely to spread .  
 
It is common to enroll children and adolescents with cancer in a clinical trial that seeks to improve cancer treatment over time. Clinical tr ials include only people who choose to take part. 
You have a choice between a standard treatment for high-grade gliomas and this clinical trial.   Please take your time to make your decision. Discuss it with your friends and family. We encourage parents to include their child in the discussion and decision to the extent that the child is able to understand and take part.   
WHAT IS THE CURRENT STANDARD OF TR EATMENT FOR THIS DISEASE? 
 
Standard treatment for high-grade gliomas includes surgery to remove as much tumor as 
possible followed by [CONTACT_69159] (treatment with high-dose x-rays). Treatment may also include chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) during and after radiation treatment. Temozolomide is This model informed consent form has been review ed by [CONTACT_60842]/NCI and is the official consent 
document for this study. Institutions should use the sections of this document which are in bold type 
in their entirety. Editorial changes to these sections may be made as long as they do not change 
information or intent. If the local IRB insists on making deletions or more substantive modifications 
to any of the sections in bold type, they must be justified in writing by [CONTACT_439275].

Page 144 one of the chemotherapy drugs often used during radiation therapy to treat newly diagnosed 
high-grade glioma. Anti-cancer drugs, such as temozolomide, are also commonly used in Maintenance therapy for newly diagnosed high-grade glioma. Maintenance therapy is therapy given after radiation therapy. 
 
 WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? 
 
High-grade gliomas are hard to treat successfully. Study doctors want to find treatments that will be better at getting rid of or shrinking high-grade gliomas. One thing they want to do is try using different chemotherapy drugs during
 radiation therapy. Treatment that combines chemotherapy 
and radiation therapy at the same time is called “chemoradiotherapy”. Two drugs that will be used in this study are vorinostat and bevacizumab.   Early studies have shown that vorinostat and bevacizumab may help radiation therapy work better to get rid of cancer cells. One study of adults with high-grade glioma found that vorinostat helped keep the cancer from getting worse over [ADDRESS_556842] page of this document.
   ACNS0822 
Page 145  
  
The goals of Part 1 of this study are to:  
 
 Find out the dose of vorinostat that can be given safely to children while they are 
receiving radiation therapy. The combination of vorinostat with radiation therapy is experimental.   
 
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TA KE PART IN THE STUDY? 
 
The total number of people enrolled on this study is expected to be 248. We will enroll between 6 and 12 people on Part 1 of this study. 
 
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN ON THIS STUDY THAT IS RESEARCH? 
 
This is a 3-part study, and different parts of this study will be done to test different treatments. In 
Part [ADDRESS_556843] 6 subjects will 
be 230 mg/m
2. If that dose doesn’t cause too many side effects, then that dose will be the dose 
used in the rest of the study. But, if the dose of 230 mg/m2 causes too many side effects, then 
the next 3 subjects will get vorinostat at a lower dose (180 mg/m2). If the lower dose does not 
cause too many side effects, then another 3 subj ects will receive the lower dose. If the lower 
dose doesn’t cause too many side effects in these [ADDRESS_556844] phase of treatment is called “chemor adiotherapy”. This phase lasts about [ADDRESS_556845] more chemotherapy. Maintenance therapy consists of 1 cycle of treatment repeated 
for up to a total of 12 cycles. Each cycle is 28 days long. During each cycle, you will receive two drugs, called bevacizumab and temozolomide. Temozolomide will be given on 5 days and bevacizumab will be given on 2 days during each  cycle. Maintenance therapy lasts about 336 
days or 11 months.

Maintenance Chemotherapy Treatment for All Subjects  
All subjects on this study will receive the same chemotherapy drugs during Maintenance 
chemotherapy. These drugs are bevacizumab and temozolomide. The purpose of Maintenance chemotherapy is to kill any rema ining glioma cells th at may regrow and ca use a relapse (cancer 
coming back). Each Maintenance cycle lasts about 28 days and the cycle may be repeated for up to a total of 12 cycles. Maintenance lasts about 11 months. The experimental treatment is using 
bevacizumab and temozolomide instead of temozolomide alone as maintenance therapy.

Page 149 extra blood and do some tests on it. We would also like to do some extra imaging studies, or 
scans (special MRI scans) to study physical changes in the tumor that happen during treatment.   The goals of the optional research studies are: 
 
 To study DNA from tumor and blood samples to see if certain genetic characteristics (the 
hereditary information that is passed on from cell to cell and tells the cell how to function) 
can be used to help identify people who are more likely to have a better treatment response.  
 
 To study tumor tissue and blood to see if the biological characteristics of the tissue and 
blood relate to how well a subject responds to treatment. We want to look at the amount of 
certain enzymes (proteins that help with chemical reactions in the body) found in the tumor 
that help protect it from the effects of chem otherapy. This information will help us to target 
more effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_439186]. 
 
 To use special MRI scanning techniques that give more information about the blood flow, 
structure, and functioning of the tumor. These scans are called perfusion MRIs and diffusion 
MRIs. They will be used together with the standard MRI scans to see if they can help identify people who are more likely to have a better treatment response.

Page 151 WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY AND HOW ARE THE RISKS 
DIFFERENT FROM TREATMENT? 
 
Treatment Risks 
All people who receive cancer treatment are at risk of having side effects. In addition to killing tumor cells, cancer chemotherapy can damage normal tissue and produce side effects. Side effects are usually reversible when the medication is stopped but occasionally persist and cause serious complications. A person can die from these and other complications.  Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and fatigue. Drugs may be given to prevent or decrease nausea and vomiting. Hair loss is usually temporary but on very rare occasions it may be permanent. Some chemotherapy may lead to sterility. Sterility is the inability to have children. There is also the possibility that a second cancer 
may develop years later as a result of the chemotherapy.   
 The risks of temozolomide, which is commonly given as treatment, and risks of standard radiation therapy are listed in the tables in Attachment #2.  
 Side effects can be increased when chemotherapy drugs are combined.  The most common serious side effect from cancer treatment is lowering of the number of blood cells resulting in anemia, increased chance of infection, and bleeding tendency . 
Low blood counts are described in the COG Family Handbook for Children with Cancer. You will be taught more about caring for your child when his or her blood counts are low.   There is a risk that the treatment plan will not cure the cancer or that the cancer can go away after the treatment and then come back at a later date.  
 For Women
: 
The treatment on this study can affect an unborn child.  You should not become pregnant 
or breast feed your baby [CONTACT_238088].  If you are sexually active and are at risk of getting pregnant, you and your male partner(s) must use an effective method to avoid pregnancy or you must not have sex.  The study  doctor will talk to you about acceptable 
methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study.  You will have to use the chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the whole time you are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctors about the length of time you need to avoid pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be permissible means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation.  If you have questions about this or want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your doctor.  If you become pregnant during the research study, please tell the study doctor and your regular doctor 
immediately. 
 
If you are nursing a baby, the drugs used in this research could pass into the breast milk. You 
should not nurse your baby [CONTACT_238089]. You may 
need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctors about the length of time you need to avoid nursing. 
 
For Men
: 
The treatment on this study can damage sperm.   You should not father a child while on this 
study as the treatment may indirectly affect an unborn child.  If you are sexually active and are at risk of causing a pregnancy, you and your female partner(s) must use a method to avoid

Page [ADDRESS_556854] to use the chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the whole time you are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to  your doctors about the length of time you need to 
avoid pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be permissible means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation. If you have questions about this or want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your doctor.  If your partner becomes pregnant during the research study, please tell the study doctor and your regular doctor immediately.  
Risks of Study There is a risk that the experimental chemoradiotherapy treatment with vorinostat may not work as well as the common chemoradiotherapy treatment with temozolomide. There 
is also a risk that you may have more side effects from the experimental 
chemoradiotherapy treatment.   There is also a risk that the experimental combination of bevacizumab and temozolomide during maintenance therapy may not be as effective as the commonly used maintenance therapy with temozolomide. There is also the risk that you may have more side effects 
from the bevacizumab and temozolomide than you would from temozolomide alone. The 
major concerns with bevacizumab are high blood pressure, protein in the urine that may mean kidney damage, bleeding, blood clots, heart damage and poor healing after surgery. These side effects are usually mild, but they can be life-threatening. Bevacizumab may make the side effects from temozolomide worse.  
 The risks of the commonly used temozolomide are listed in the table on Attachment #[ADDRESS_556855] page of this document.

Radiation Risks   
All types of radiation therapy have side effects. Some side effects depend on the location 
of the tumor.  Some go away during or soon after treatment (short-term effects), and 
others may appear later (long-term effects). In addition, the side effects of radiation can be made worse by [CONTACT_439281] (surgery, chemotherapy, or other medicine).  There may be side effects that we do not know about yet.  The list below gives possible short-term and long-term side effects.   
Short-term: Possible short–term side effects of radiation therapy include nausea and 
vomiting; fatigue (tiredness) and loss of appeti te; irritation or redness of the skin and hair 
loss corresponding to the entrance and exit points of the radiation beams; rarely there is 
peeling of the skin at the site of irradiation; if the ear canal or middle ear receives a significant doses there may be an increase in the amount of ear wax (cerumen), there may 
also be a feeling of fullness that may last for weeks or months although this should be 
uncommon; in general, blood counts are not reduced by [CONTACT_439282], for those children who have received chemotherapy and G-CSF prior to radiation therapy there may be a transient lowering of counts during treatment although this would most likely be due to the prior chemotherapy.

   ACNS0822 
Page 163 radiation therapy, the short term side effects of treatment listed above may be slightly 
worse, including fatigue and loss of appetite.   
Long-term: The occurrence and severity of long-term si de effects of radiation therapy to the 
brain depend on the age of the patient at the time of treatment, the area of the brain that 
requires treatment, complications that arise from the tumor or treatments prior to radiation therapy such as surgery and chemotherapy. Growth hormone deficiency after radiation therapy is common. Less common are deficiencies in thyroid hormone, stress (adrenal) hormone, and the hormones required for puberty. Any type of hearing loss after radiation 
therapy alone occurs only in the minority of cases and many years after treatment. 
Combined with chemotherapy such as that used in this study, hearing loss maybe seen within one to two years after radiation therapy. Radiation therapy may affect the ability to learn and, generally speaking, overall performance in school. Radiation therapy may also affect growth and development by [CONTACT_439283]. Permanent hair loss occurs rarely. The doses of radiation used in 
this study are generally accepted as safe, meaning that the chance of breakdown of normal tissue (necrosis) or significant blood vessel damage that would result in stroke or permanent neurologic damage is very rare. With any type of radiation therapy there is always the chance that another tumor may appear years later in tissues that are in the field 
of radiation.

PART 2 – Comparing Three Treatments 
 
If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child who may take part in this study, permission from 
you is required. The assent (agreement) of your child may also be required. When we say “you” in this consent form, we mean you or your child; “we” means the doctors and other staff. 
 
WHY ARE YOU BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? 
 
This study is called a clinical trial. A clinical tr ial is a research study involving treatment of a 
disease in human patients. This study is or ganized by [CONTACT_63779]’s Oncology Group (COG). COG 
is an international research group that conducts clinical trials for children with cancer. More than 
[ADDRESS_556859] been diagnosed with a type of brain tumor called a high-grade glioma. A “high-grade” glioma is a tumor that grows 
fast and is more likely to spread .  
 
It is common to enroll children and adolescents with cancer in a clinical trial that seeks to improve cancer treatment over time. Clinical tr ials include only people who choose to take part. 
You have a choice between a standard treatment for high-grade gliomas and this clinical trial.   Please take your time to make your decision. Discuss it with your friends and family. We encourage parents to include their child in the discussion and decision to the extent that the child is able to understand and take part.   
WHAT IS THE CURRENT STANDARD OF TR EATMENT FOR THIS DISEASE? 
 
Standard treatment for high-grade gliomas includes surgery to remove as much tumor as 
possible followed by [CONTACT_69159] (treatment with high-dose x-rays). Treatment may also include chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) during and after radiation treatment. Temozolomide is 
one of the chemotherapy drugs often used during radiation therapy to treat newly diagnosed high-grade glioma. Anti-cancer drugs, such as temozolomide, are also commonly used in This model informed consent form has been review ed by [CONTACT_60842]/NCI and is the official consent

WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? 
 
High-grade gliomas are hard to treat successfully. Study doctors want to find treatments that will be better at getting rid of or shrinking high-grade gliomas. One thing they want to do is try using different chemotherapy drugs during
 radiation therapy. Treatment that combines chemotherapy 
and radiation therapy at the same time is called “chemoradiotherapy”. Two drugs that will be used in this study are vorinostat and bevacizumab.   Early studies have shown that vorinostat may help radiation therapy work better to get rid of cancer cells. One study of adults with high-grade glioma found that vorinostat helped keep the cancer from getting worse over [ADDRESS_556860] treatments from Part 2. People who are in Part 2 of this study will not be in Part 3. We are now doing Part 2 of the study. You are being asked to enroll on Part 2 of this study.   
The goals of Part 2 of this study are to:  
 
 Find out what effects, good and/or bad, chemoradiotherapy with vorinostat
 followed 
by [CONTACT_439284]-grade gliomas. The combination of vorinostat with radiation therapy is experimental.  Maintenance therapy with bevacizumab and temozolomide is experimental.

 Find out what effects, good and/or bad, chemoradiotherapy with bevacizumab  
followed by [CONTACT_439285]-grade gliomas. The combination of bevacizumab with radiation therapy is experimental.  Maintenance therapy with bevacizumab and temozolomide is experimental.  
 
 Find out what effects, good and/or bad, chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide
 
followed by [CONTACT_439284]-grade gliomas. The combination of temozolomide with radiation therapy is not
 experimental.  Maintenance therapy with bevacizumab 
and temozolomide is experimental.  
 
 Compare the effects of the three treatments above to find out which is better at 
getting rid of or shrinking tumors and has the least amount of side effects.  
 
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TA KE PART IN THE STUDY? 
 
The total number of people enrolled on this study is expected to be up to 268. We enrolled 6 patients on Part 1.  We will enroll up to 120 people on Part 2 of this study. Later, we will enroll up to 142 more people on Part 3 of this study. 
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN ON THIS STUDY THAT IS RESEARCH? 
 
Random Assignment  
 
Subjects (people participating in the study) will receive one of [ADDRESS_556861] phase of treatment is called “chemor adiotherapy”. This phase lasts about [ADDRESS_556862] week of starting radiation therapy, you will begin taking one of 3 
drugs (bevacizumab, vorinostat, or temozolomide) during this phase. You will continue taking the drug while you receive radiation therapy. After you complete radiation therapy and the 
treatment with the drug, you will have a 4-week  rest, during which no treatment is given.  
 
The second phase of treatment, called Maintenance therapy, begins after the 4-week rest 
period. During Maintenance therapy, you will not re ceive any further radiation therapy but you 
will have more chemotherapy. Maintenance therapy  consists of [ADDRESS_556863] page of this document.
   ACNS0822 
Page 168 on 5 days and bevacizumab will be given on 2 days during each cycle.  Maintenance therapy 
lasts about 336 days or 11 months.  
The 3 treatment plans are the same except for a difference in what drug you will receive during 
chemoradiotherapy. All treatment plans will use the same radiation therapy. All treatment plans will use the same Maintenance chemotherapy.  
 The 3 treatment arms are called Arm A, Arm B, and Arm C as follows:  
 Arm A
: Chemoradiotherapy with vorinostat  followed by [CONTACT_439286]. 
  Arm B
: Chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide  followed by [CONTACT_439287]. 
  Arm C
: Chemoradiotherapy with bevacizumab followed by [CONTACT_439287]. 
 
Randomization  
 
Randomization: Subjects will be randomized to  either Arm A with vorinostat, Arm B with 
temozolomide, or Arm C with bevacizumab. The radiation therapy itself will be the same in all 
groups of subjects. Maintenance therapy will also be the same in all groups of subjects.

Maintenance Chemotherapy Treatment for ALL SUBJECTS on ALL Treatment Arms  
All subjects on this study will receive t he same chemotherapy drugs during Maintenance 
chemotherapy. These drugs are bevacizumab and temozolomide. The purpose of Maintenance 
chemotherapy is to kill any remaining glioma cells that may regrow and cause a relapse (cancer coming back). Each Maintenance cycle lasts about 28 days and the cycle may be repeated for up to a total of 12 cycles. Maintenance lasts about 11 months. The experimental treatment is using bevacizumab and temozolomide instead of temozolomide alone as maintenance therapy.

Bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes* 1 and 15 
Temozolomide PO 1-5 
*The first dose will be given over [ADDRESS_556867]. We would like to do some extra tests on your tumor tissue, and take some extra blood and do some tests on it. We would also like to do some extra imaging studies, or 
scans (special MRI scans) to study physical changes in the tumor that happen during treatment.  
 
The goals of the optional research studies are: 
 
 To study DNA from tumor and blood samples to see if certain genetic characteristics (the 
hereditary information that is passed on from cell to cell and tells the cell how to function) 
can be used to help identify people who are more likely to have a better treatment response.  
 
 To study tumor tissue and blood to see if the biological characteristics of the tissue and 
blood relate to how well a subject responds to treatment. We want to look at the amount of 
certain enzymes (proteins that help with chemical reactions in the body) found in the tumor that help protect it from the effects of chem otherapy. This information will help us to target 
more effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_439186]. 
 
 To use special MRI scanning techniques that give more information about the blood flow, 
structure, and functioning of the tumor. These scans are called perfusion MRIs and diffusion

WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY AND HOW ARE THE RISKS 
DIFFERENT FROM TREATMENT? 
 
Treatment Risks 
All people who receive cancer treatment are at risk of having side effects. In addition to killing tumor cells, cancer chemotherapy can damage normal tissue and produce side effects. Side effects are usually reversible when the medication is stopped but occasionally persist and cause serious complications. A person can die from these and other complications.  Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and fatigue. Drugs may be given to prevent or decrease nausea and vomiting. Hair loss is usually temporary but on very rare occasions it may be permanent. Some chemotherapy may lead to sterility. Sterility is the inability to have children. There is also the possibility that a second cancer 
may develop years later as a result of the chemotherapy.   
 The risks of temozolomide, which is commonly given as treatment, and risks of standard radiation therapy are listed in the tables in Attachment #2.  
 Side effects can be increased when chemotherapy drugs are combined.  The most common serious side effect from cancer treatment is lowering of the number of blood cells resulting in anemia, increased chance of infection, and bleeding tendency . 
Low blood counts are described in the COG Family Handbook for Children with Cancer. You will be taught more about caring for your child when his or her blood counts are low.   There is a risk that the treatment plan will not cure the cancer or that the cancer can go away after the treatment and then come back at a later date.  
 
Reproductive risks
 
Women should not become pregnant and men should not father a baby [CONTACT_439288](s) in this study can be bad for an unborn baby. If you or your 
partner can get pregnant, it is important fo r you to use birth control or not have sex while 
on this study. Check with your study doctor about what kind of birth control methods to use and how long to use them. Some birth control methods might not be approved for use in this study. Women should not breastfeed a baby [CONTACT_56035]. Also check with your doctor about how long you should not breastfeed after you stop the study 
treatment(s). 
 
Risks of Study 
If you are assigned to Arm B with temozolomide, there is a risk that you may not receive 
a chemoradiotherapy treatment that is better at getting rid of your cancer.  
 If you are assigned to Arm A with vorinostat or to Arm C with bevacizumab, there is a risk that the experimental chemoradiotherapy treatment may not work as well as the chemoradiotherapy treatment with temozolomide. There is also a risk that you may have more side effects from the experimental chemoradiotherapy treatment.  
 
For all subjects in this study, there is the risk that the experimental combination of bevacizumab and temozolomide during maintenance therapy may not be as effective as the commonly used maintenance therapy with temozolomide alone. There is also the risk 
Use of this document is governed by [CONTACT_439195].
   ACNS0822 
Page [ADDRESS_556872] more side effects from the bevacizumab and temozolomide than you 
would from temozolomide alone. The major concerns with bevacizumab are high blood pressure, protein in the urine that may mean kidney damage, bleeding, blood clots, heart 
damage and poor healing after surgery. These side effects are usually mild, but they can 
be life-threatening. Bevacizumab may make the side effects from temozolomide worse.   
The risks of the commonly used temozolomide are listed in the table on Attachment #[ADDRESS_556873] page of this document.

Radiation Risks   
All types of radiation therapy have side effects. Some side effects depend on the location 
of the tumor.  Some go away during or soon after treatment (short-term effects), and 
others may appear later (long-term effects). In addition, the side effects of radiation can be made worse by [CONTACT_439281] (surgery, chemotherapy, or other medicine).  There may be side effects that we do not know about yet.  The list below gives possible short-term and long-term side effects.  
 
Short-term: Possible short–term side effects of radiation therapy include nausea and 
vomiting; fatigue (tiredness) and loss of appeti te; irritation or redness of the skin and hair 
loss corresponding to the entrance and exit points of the radiation beams; rarely there is peeling of the skin at the site of irradiation; if the ear canal or middle ear receives a 
significant doses there may be an increase in the amount of ear wax (cerumen), there may 
also be a feeling of fullness that may last for weeks or months although this should be uncommon; in general, blood counts are not reduced by [CONTACT_439282], for those children who have received chemotherapy and G-CSF prior to radiation therapy there may be a transient lowering of counts during treatment although this would most likely be due to the prior chemotherapy.

Page 186 radiation therapy, the short term side effects of treatment listed above may be slightly 
worse, including fatigue and loss of appetite.   
Long-term: The occurrence and severity of long-term si de effects of radiation therapy to the 
brain depend on the age of the patient at the time of treatment, the area of the brain that 
requires treatment, complications that arise from the tumor or treatments prior to radiation therapy such as surgery and chemotherapy. Growth hormone deficiency after radiation therapy is common. Less common are deficiencies in thyroid hormone, stress (adrenal) hormone, and the hormones required for puberty. Any type of hearing loss after radiation 
therapy alone occurs only in the minority of cases and many years after treatment. 
Combined with chemotherapy, such as that used in this study, hearing loss maybe seen within one to two years after radiation therapy. Radiation therapy may affect the ability to learn and, generally speaking, overall performance in school. Radiation therapy may also affect growth and development by [CONTACT_439283]. Permanent hair loss occurs rarely. The doses of radiation used in 
this study are generally accepted as safe, meaning that the chance of breakdown of normal tissue (necrosis) or significant blood vessel damage that would result in stroke or permanent neurologic damage is very rare. With any type of radiation therapy there is always the chance that another tumor may appear years later in tissues that are in the field 
of radiation.

PART 3 – Comparing Two Treatments 
 
If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child who may take part in this study, permission from 
you is required. The assent (agreement) of your child may also be required. When we say “you” in this consent form, we mean you or your child; “we” means the doctors and other staff. 
 
 
WHY ARE YOU BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? 
 This study is called a clinical trial. A clinical tr ial is a research study involving treatment of a 
disease in human patients. This study is or ganized by [CONTACT_63779]’s Oncology Group (COG). COG 
is an international research group that conducts clinical trials for children with cancer. More than [ADDRESS_556878] been diagnosed with a type of brain tumor called a high-grade glioma. A “high-grade” glioma is a tumor that grows 
fast and is more likely to spread .  
 
It is common to enroll children and adolescents with cancer in a clinical trial that seeks to improve cancer treatment over time. Clinical tr ials include only people who choose to take part. 
You have a choice between a standard treatment for high-grade gliomas and this clinical trial.   Please take your time to make your decision. Discuss it with your friends and family. We encourage parents to include their child in the discussion and decision to the extent that the child is able to understand and take part.   
WHAT IS THE CURRENT STANDARD OF TR EATMENT FOR THIS DISEASE? 
 
Standard treatment for high-grade gliomas includes surgery to remove as much tumor as 
possible followed by [CONTACT_69159] (treatment with high-dose x-rays). Treatment may also include chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) during and after radiation treatment. Temozolomide is 
one of the chemotherapy drugs often used during radiation therapy to treat newly diagnosed This model informed consent form has been review ed by [CONTACT_60842]/NCI and is the official consent

Maintenance therapy for newly diagnosed high-grade glioma. Maintenance therapy is therapy given after radiation therapy. 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? 
 
High-grade gliomas are hard to treat successfully. Study doctors want to find treatments that will be better at getting rid of or shrinking high-grade gliomas. One thing they want to do is try using different chemotherapy drugs during
 radiation therapy. Treatment that combines chemotherapy 
and radiation therapy at the same time is called “chemoradiotherapy”.   Early studies have shown that vorinostat may help radiation therapy work better to get rid of cancer cells. One study of adults with high-grade glioma found that vorinostat helped keep the cancer from getting worse over [ADDRESS_556879] the combination is well-tolerated. Study doctors think the combination of temozolomide and bevacizumab will be well-tolerated by [CONTACT_439292], and that the combination may work better than temozolomide alone to get rid of or shrink high-grade gliomas.  This study is being done in 3 parts. Parts 1 and 2 are now finished. In Part 1, we found the dose of vorinostat that can be given safely to subjects during radiation therapy. In Part 2, we tested and compared two experimental treatments (one using vorinostat and one using bevacizumab) with treatment using temozolomide. Results from Part 2 showed that [insert bevacizumab or 
vorinostat] worked better than treatment with temozolomide to help keep the cancer from getting worse over one year. We are now doing Part [ADDRESS_556880] and compare chemoradiotherapy using [insert bevacizumab or vorinostat]  with 
chemoradiotherapy using temozolomide. By [CONTACT_439293], study doctors hope to confirm the results seen in Part 2. You are being asked to enroll on Part [ADDRESS_556881] page of this document.
   ACNS0822 
Page 190 The goals of Part 3 of this study are to:  
 
 Compare the effects of two treatments to find out which is better at getting rid of or 
shrinking tumors and has the least amount of side effects. The t wo treatments are:  
 
 Chemoradiotherapy with [insert either bevacizumab  or vorinostat ] 
followed by [CONTACT_439284]-grade gliomas. The combination of [insert either bevacizumab
 or vorinostat ] with radiation 
therapy is experimental.  Maintenance therapy with bevacizumab and temozolomide is experimental.  
  Chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide
 followed by [CONTACT_439294]-grade gliomas. The combination of temozolomide with radiation therapy is not
 experimental.  Maintenance therapy with 
bevacizumab and temozolomide is experimental.  
 
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TA KE PART IN THE STUDY? 
 The total number of people enrolled on this study is expected to be up to 268. We enrolled 6 patients on Part 1 and up to 120 people on Part 2 of this study. Now we are enrolling up to 142 more people on Part 3 of this study.   
WHAT WILL HAPPEN ON THIS STUDY THAT IS RESEARCH? 
 Random Assignment
 
 Subjects (people participating in the study) will receive one of [ADDRESS_556882] phase of treatment is called “chemoradiotherapy”. This phase lasts about [ADDRESS_556883] week of starting radiation therapy, you will begin taking one of the 2 
drugs (either [insert bevacizumab or vorinostat ] or temozolomide) used during this phase. You 
will continue taking the drug while you receive radiation therapy. After you complete radiation therapy and treatment with the drug, you will have a 4-week rest, during which no treatment is 
given.

Page [ADDRESS_556884] more chemotherapy. Maintenance therapy consists of 1 cycle of treatment repeated 
for up to a total of 12 cycles. Each cycle is 28 days long. During each cycle, you will receive two drugs called bevacizumab and temozolomide. Temozolomide will be given on 5 days and bevacizumab will be given on 2 days during each cycle.  Maintenance therapy lasts about 336 days or 11 months.  
The 2 treatment plans are the same except for a difference in what drug you will receive during 
chemoradiotherapy. All treatment plans will use the same radiation therapy. All treatment plans 
will use the same Maintenance chemotherapy.  
 The 2 treatment arms are called Arm A and Arm B as follows:  
 Arm A
: Chemoradiation with [ insert bevacizumab  or vorinostat ] followed by 
[CONTACT_439234]. 
  Arm B
: Chemoradiation with temozolomide  followed by [CONTACT_439286]. 
 
 
Randomization  
 
Participants will be randomized to receive either [ insert bevacizumab or vorinostat ] or 
temozolomide during radiation ther apy. The radiation therapy itself will be the same in all groups of 
subjects. Maintenance therapy will also be the same in all groups of subjects.

We would also like to do some extra imaging studies, or scans (special MRI scans), to study physical changes in the tumor that happen during 
treatment.  
 
The goals of the optional research studies are: 
 
 To study DNA from tumor and blood samples to see if certain genetic characteristics (the 
hereditary information that is passed on from cell to cell and tells the cell how to function) 
can be used to help identify people who are more likely to have a better treatment response.

Page 195  To study tumor tissue and blood to see if the biological characteristics of the tissue relate to 
how well a subject responds to treatment. We want to look at the amount of certain enzymes 
(proteins that help with chemical reactions in the body) found in the tumor that help protect it from the effects of chemotherapy. This informati on will help us to target more effective 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_439186]. 
 
 To use special MRI scanning techniques that give more information about the blood flow, 
structure, and functioning of the tumor. These scans are called perfusion MRIs and diffusion 
MRIs. They will be used together with the standard MRI scans to see if they can help identify people who are more likely to have a better treatment response.

WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY AND HOW ARE THE RISKS 
DIFFERENT FROM TREATMENT? 
 
Treatment Risks 
All people who receive cancer treatment are at risk of having side effects. In addition to killing tumor cells, cancer chemotherapy can damage normal tissue and produce side effects. Side effects are usually reversible when the medication is stopped but occasionally persist and cause serious complications. A person can die from these and other complications.  Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and fatigue. Drugs may be given to prevent or decrease nausea and vomiting. Hair loss is usually temporary but on very rare occasions it may be permanent. Some chemotherapy may lead to sterility. Sterility is the inability to have children. There is also the possibility that a second cancer 
may develop years later as a result of the chemotherapy.   
 The risks of temozolomide, which is commonly given as treatment, and risks of radiation therapy are listed in the tables in Attachment #[ADDRESS_556893] after the treatment and then come back at a later date .  
 
Reproductive risks
 
Women should not become pregnant and men should not father a baby [CONTACT_439295](s) in this study can be bad for an unborn baby. If you or your partner can 
get pregnant, it is important for you to use birth control or not have sex while on this study. Check with your study doctor about what kind of birth control methods to use and how long to use them. Some birth control methods might not be approved for use in this study. Women should not breastfeed a baby [CONTACT_56035]. Also check with your doctor about how long you should not breastfeed after you stop the study  
 
Risks of Study If you are assigned to Arm B with temozolomide, there is a risk that you may not receive a chemoradiotherapy treatment that is better at getting rid of your cancer.   
If you are assigned to Arm A with [ insert bevacizumab or vorinostat ], there is a risk that 
the experimental chemoradiotherapy treatment may not work as well as the

Page [ADDRESS_556894] more side effects from the bevacizumab and temozolomide that you would from temozolomide alone. The major concerns with bevacizumab are high blood pressure, protein in the urine that may mean kidney damage, bleeding, blood clots, heart 
damage and poor healing after surgery. These side effects are usually mild, but they can 
be life-threatening. Bevacizumab may make the side effects from temozolomide worse.   
The risks of the commonly used temozolomide are listed in the table on Attachment #2 . The 
risks and side effects related to the study drugs bevacizumab [if vorinostat then insert

people with pre-existing problems 
such as heart or blood vessel disease. 
 
 
*Neutropenia (decrease in white blood cells) is a common side effect of chemotherapy drugs. The incidence of this event may be increased when bevacizumab is added to 
chemotherapy; there was also an increase in neutropenia-related fever and infections, 
including rare incidences of infection with fatal outcomes.

Risks and side effects related to vorinostat  include those which are:   
 
 
 
Likely Less Likely Rare but serious
 Fewer red blood cells and 
platelets in the blood  
o a low number of red 
blood cells can 
make you feel tired 
and weak 
o a low number of platelets that may cause you to 
bruise and bleed more 
easily 
 A feeling of extreme tiredness, weakness, 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], or not feeling well 
that is not relieved by [CONTACT_55628] 
 Loss of appetite 
 Diarrhea 
 Nausea 
 Vomiting   Low numbers of white blood 
cells called lymphocytes 
and / or neutrophils that 
may make it easier to get 
infections.  The infections 
may be life threatening 
 Low number of white blood cells 
can make it easier to get 
infections 
 Fever (high temperature) 
 Hair loss  
 Constipation 
 Excessive loss of water from the 
body  
 Dry mouth 
 Acid or upset stomach (heartburn) 
 Change in the way things taste 
 Infection 
 Abnormally low level of the 
protein albumin in the blood.  Low 
albumin may result in leaking of 
fluid from the blood into the 
tissue  
 Increased levels of a chemical 
(creatinine) in the blood which could mean kidney damage 
 Increase in the blood of certain 
enzymes or bilirubin (a substance 
that comes from the liver 
breaking down waste products) 
which could indicate liver 
irritation or damage 
 Increase in the level of sugar in 
the blood that may require 
treatment 
 Abnormally low levels of certain 
salts (electrolytes) like phosphate 
and/or calcium and/or sodium, 
and/or potassium in the body 
which may require that you take 
supplements by [CONTACT_59607]  
 An involuntary and abnormal 
contraction of muscle 
 Loss of strength in the muscles  
 Dizziness (or sensation of 
lightheadedness, giddiness, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_439188]) 
 Abdominal pain  
 Cough 
  Feeling short of breath 
 Weight loss   Death of skin tissue which 
could lead to surgical treatment and be life-
threatening 
 
In addition to the risks described above, there may be unkn own risks, or risks that we di d not anticipate, associated

Radiation Risks   
All types of radiation therapy have side effects. Some side effects depend on the location 
of the tumor.  Some go away during or soon after treatment (short-term effects), and 
others may appear later (long-term effects). In addition, the side effects of radiation can be made worse by [CONTACT_439281] (surgery, chemotherapy, or other medicine).  There may be side effects that we do not know about yet.  The list below gives possible short-term and long-term side effects.  
 
Short-term: Possible short–term side effects of radiation therapy include nausea and 
vomiting; fatigue (tiredness) and loss of appeti te; irritation or redness of the skin and hair 
loss corresponding to the entrance and exit points of the radiation beams; rarely there is peeling of the skin at the site of irradiation; if the ear canal or middle ear receives a 
significant doses there may be an increase in the amount of ear wax (cerumen), there may 
also be a feeling of fullness that may last for weeks or months although this should be uncommon; in general, blood counts are not reduced by [CONTACT_439282], for those children who have received chemotherapy and G-CSF prior to radiation therapy there may be a transient lowering of counts during treatment although this would most likely be due to the prior chemotherapy.

Page 209 radiation therapy, the short term side effects of treatment listed above may be slightly 
worse, including fatigue and loss of appetite.   
Long-term: The occurrence and severity of long-term si de effects of radiation therapy to the 
brain depend on the age of the patient at the time of treatment, the area of the brain that 
requires treatment, complications that arise from the tumor or treatments prior to radiation therapy such as surgery and chemotherapy. Growth hormone deficiency after radiation therapy is common. Less common are deficiencies in thyroid hormone, stress (adrenal) hormone, and the hormones required for puberty. Any type of hearing loss after radiation 
therapy alone occurs only in the minority of cases and many years after treatment. 
Combined with chemotherapy, such as that used in this study, hearing loss maybe seen within one to two years after radiation therapy. Radiation therapy may affect the ability to learn and, generally speaking, overall performance in school. Radiation therapy may also affect growth and development by [CONTACT_439283]. Permanent hair loss occurs rarely. The doses of radiation used in 
this study are generally accepted as safe, meaning that the chance of breakdown of normal tissue (necrosis) or significant blood vessel damage that would result in stroke or permanent neurologic damage is very rare. With any type of radiation therapy there is always the chance that another tumor may appear years later in tissues that are in the field 
of radiation.

Certificate of Confidentiality  
 
 
The Children's Oncology Group has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal 
government, which will help us protect the privacy of our research subjects.  The Certificate 
protects against the involuntary release of in formation about subjects collected during the 
course of our covered studies.  The researchers involved in the studies cannot be forced to 
disclose the identity or any information collected in the study in any legal proceedings at 
the federal, state, or local level, regardless of whether they are criminal, administrative, or 
legislative proceedings.  However, the subject or the researcher may choose to voluntarily 
disclose the protected information under certain circumstances.  For example, if the subject 
or his/her guardian requests the release of information in writing, the Certificate does not 
protect against that voluntary disclosure.  Furthermore, federal agencies may review our 
records under limited circumst ances, such as a DHHS request for informat ion for an audit 
or program evaluation or an FDA request under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. 
The Certificate of Confidentiality will not protect against the required reporting by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_439191], reportable communicable diseases, and/or 
possible threat of harm to self or others.

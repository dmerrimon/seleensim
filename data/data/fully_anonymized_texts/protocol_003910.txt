1. Protocol Title:   
Non-invasive intracranial pressure estimation in intracranial hypotension using magnetic 
resonance imaging  
 
 
2. Study Purpose:    
The purpose of this study is t o estimate the intracranial pressure (ICP) in subjects with 
intracranial hypotension (a condition caused by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_590118] (CSF) leakage, 
often associated with low CSF pressure) using non -invasive MRI techniques, and to 
determine whether change s in estimated ICP are seen after treatment of this condition.   
 
 
3. Background & Significance:    
Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a secondary cause of headache that has 
historically suffered from under -diagnosis but is becoming increasingly recognized.  [ADDRESS_777423] all cases, spi[INVESTIGATOR_590119] (CSF) leaks are the causative etiology for the clinical syndrome.[ADDRESS_777424] widely accepted 
criteria for the disease, the International Classification of Headache Disorders, Version 3 
(ICHD -3), incorporates criteria derived from clinical presentation, a natomic brain 
imaging, spi[INVESTIGATOR_503485], and CSF pressure measurement, with the latter 2 tests typi[INVESTIGATOR_590120].  From the standpoint of diagnosis, it would clearly be 
advantageous to develop  additional noninvasive diagnostic modalities  that could help 
establish the diagnosis with a high degree of sensitivity .   
 
Treatment can also be challenging in intracranial hypotension.  The primary treatment 
modality, epi[INVESTIGATOR_590121], is not effective in all cases, and it is common for 
patients to require several epi[INVESTIGATOR_590122].  Furthermore, successful treatment may be complicated by [CONTACT_590136], termed ‘rebound intracranial hypertension,’ that may 
mimic s ymptoms of low pressure.[ADDRESS_777425] been developed that may be able to estimate ICP in a non -
invasive fashi on. The MRI -based method for measurement of ICP  (MRICP method)  is 
based on basic principles of the cranio -spi[INVESTIGATOR_590123] : The mono -exponential 
relationship between intracranial volume and pressure leads to a linear relationship 
Research Summary  
 
 
 
 between elastance (i. e., the derivative of pressure with respect to volume) and pressur e. 
The MRI method utilizes well -established velocity encoding cine MR imaging to 
measure elastance from the ratio of volume and pressure changes during the cardiac 
cycle. The measurement of the momentary differences between the volumes of blood an d 
CSF entering and leaving the cranium during the cardiac cycle provides an estimate of 
the intracranial volume change , and the pressure difference is estimated  using  the 
derivative of the CSF velocities. The method has been recently validated independently 
by a group in Munich by [CONTACT_590137] -functioning  
shunts.  
 
The MRI measurement is obtained using [ADDRESS_777426] scan with a total scan time 
of about 10  minutes. Therefore the MRICP method is well suited as an add -on for a 
diagnostic MRI study.  In this study the MRICP method will be utilized as a potential 
diagnostic tool diagnosis of intracranial hypotension, and as a tool to monitor treatment 
response.  
 
In addition to estimation of ICP, the caliber and flow velocity through the dural venous 
sinuses will be studied.  It is well established that t here is a relationship between the 
caliber of the intracranial dural venous sinuses and disorders of CSF pressure.   In 
particular, the caliber of the junction of the transverse and sigmoid  sinuses has been 
found to be reduced in idiopathic intracranial hy potension (IIH) and increased in 
spontaneous intracranial hypotension, diseases characterized  by [CONTACT_590138] w CSF 
pressures, respectively.5-8  This portion of the sinus has been hypothesized to be 
distensible owing to its lack of fi xed dural margins, and may serve as a ‘barometer’ of 
intracranial pressure.   
 
As a secondary aim, therefore, we plan to study the caliber of the sinus and flow velocity 
through this portion of the sinus in subjects with SIH using non -contrast 3D phase -
contrast MR venography, a well -established sequence  in current clinical use .  Our goals 
are to establish baseline measurements of cross sectional area and velocity, and to study 
how these parameters change following treatment of SIH with epi[INVESTIGATOR_590124].  
 
4. Design & Procedures:          
This is a prospective , single -arm proof -of-concept  study  with enrollment goal of [ADDRESS_777427] -of-care testing to ICP measurements estimated by [CONTACT_590139].  
 
Secondary objectives  include : (1) assessment of change in estimated I CP prior to and 
following standard -of-care epi[INVESTIGATOR_590125] (2) evaluate changes in diameter and 
flow velocity through the transverse dural venous sinus prior to and following epi[INVESTIGATOR_590126] .   
 
4.3 Pre -registration procedures  
Potential subje cts will be identified from among patients referred to our department for 
evaluation/treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.  Currently, our department 
is one of the few referral centers for this condition in the country, ensuring an active 
practice with high volumes of new patients suffering from this condition.  
 
Currently, our standard practice is to contact [CONTACT_590140]’s history, prior testing, and expectation for thei r 
upcoming visit.  This contract is made by [CONTACT_127958] 3 radiologists who perform epi[INVESTIGATOR_590127], or the physician’s assistant associated with our practice.  Because 
many of our patients are referred from out of state, this provides an opportunit y to 
establish a relationship with the provider, to determine what testing will be necessary, 
and to answer any patient questions about their trip. Patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_590128], and are advised to stay locally1 -[ADDRESS_777428] -of-care 
lumbar puncture (i.e. the same day as the procedure, prior to the scheduled procedure 
appointment, or the day before) , and within one day following the epi[INVESTIGATOR_590129]. The lumbar puncture and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_590130].    On the day of the pre-treatment MRI, the research coordinator will 
meet with the patient pr ior to the scan to have the patient si gn consent for th e study.  
 
All subjects will undergo their scheduled medical procedures as planned regardless of 
their decision to participate or not participate in the study; no change to the medical care 
of the patient will be made as part of this study .  
 
 
4.[ADDRESS_777429] -of-care procedure, and brain MRI imaging findings positive for intracranial 
hypotension serve as inclusion criteria (see section 5.1), it is anticipated that all patients 
will have undergone MRI scanning without complication prior to enrollment, and 
therefore few if any patients will be expected to have contraindications to MRI scanning.  
 
 
5. Selection of Subjects:   
5.[ADDRESS_777430] s and eligibility  
 
Subjects will be identified and approached using the p rocedures describe in Section 4.3 
and 4.4 above.  
 
 
5.2 Inclusion & Exclusion criteria  
Inclusion criteria will consist of the following:  
 Known diagnosis of intracranial hypotension, established by [CONTACT_54041]:  the presence of orthostatic headache, and one or more of the following 
criteria: prior CSF opening pressure ≤6 cmH20, demonstration of an active spi[INVESTIGATOR_590131], or cranial MRI changes of intracranial 
hypotension.9 
 Ability to provide informed consent.  
 Expected ability to complete standard -of-care procedures (lumbar puncture and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_590132])  
 
Exclusion criteria will consist of the following:  
 Known contraindication to MRI (p acemaker, MRI incompatible hardware, etc.)  
Research Summary  
 
 
 
  Severe claustrophobia or other condition requiring the need for anxiolysis, 
sedation, or any other medication for MRI scanning  
 Inability or expected inability to complete study interventions as scheduled  
 Any known contraindication to standard -of-care procedures (e.g. coagulopathy, 
allergic reaction to required medication, lack of vascular access, etc.)  
 
6. Subject Recruitment & Compensation:       
 
There  is no subject compensation in this study.       
     
7. Consent  Process:  
Once patients have agreed to participate and arrive at Duke University Medical Center 
prior to their MRI scan, study personnel will approach eligible subjects in a location 
sufficient to provide for private and confidential discussion . Written in formed c onsent 
will be obtained on the date of their procedure  using standard IRB -approved consent 
processes .  
 
The subject will be given time to read the consent and discuss alone or with 
family/friends present. The consent will be signed only after all q uestions are answered. 
There  will be no time limit for potential  subjects to consider participation. The  study 
personnel w ill take as much time as needed to answer all questions and thoroughly 
review the consent form with potential subject. This  will likely take between [ADDRESS_777431]’s Capacity to  Give Legally Effective Consent:  
Subjects must be capable of providing informed consent to participate in this study . 
            
9. Study Interventions :    
The study intervention will consist of the pre-intervent ion and post -intervention MRI, as 
detailed above.  Scans will be performed without the need for intravenous contrast.  
            
10. Risk/ Benefit Assessment:         
The risk to the subject from undergoing a non -contrast MRI study is minimal .  The major 
risk is entering the magnetic field with an implanted non -MRI compatible device or 
hardware, or other ferromagnetic metallic object.  This risk will be mitigated through the 
use of standard MRI screening techniques performed by [CONTACT_590141].  Again, because patients will have undergone MRI 
scanning of the brain as part of the standard diagnostic workup for intracranial 
hypotension, it is anticipated that few if any patients will have contraindicated hardwar e 
or metallic devices.  Another risk is the risk of anxiety or claustrophobia associated with 
MRI scanning, which is screened for routinely by [CONTACT_590142] t o enrollment.  
Research Summary  
 
 
 
  
Another potential risk associated with any research that involves data storage is the 
potential  risk is loss of confidentiality. This  will be minimized by [CONTACT_590143]  (RDSP) . Because this technique is investigational, no direct 
benefit to the subject can be promised.  
         
11. Cost to the subject:   
There will be no cost to the subjects  
 
12. Data Analysis & Statistical Considerations:     
As detailed above, the primary outcome measure is a comparison of ICP estimated with 
MR technique and the CSF pressure measured by [CONTACT_259778].  Comparative 
statistics will be used for this analysis; the selection of appropriate statistical methods 
will depend on the normality of the data.  It is anticipated that the main statistics will be 
descriptive and univariate comparisons.  More advanced statistical techniques requiring 
support of a statistician are not anticipated, but if required by [CONTACT_590144], will be determined in consultation with the departmental statistician as 
necessary.  
 
13. Data & Safety Monitoring:             
Physical risks associated with the non -contrast MRI are minimal, as noted above. Any 
unexpected adverse events during the MRI will be addressed according to stand ard 
practice and departmental guidelines.  Given the small number of subjects and 
exploratory nature of the data, n o data monitoring committee wil l be used for this study .  
The risk of loss of confidentiality will be mitigated through the adherence to the RDSP.    
   
14. Privacy, Data storage & Confidentiality:          
Every effort will be made to ensure confidentiality of the patients included in this study.  
Other d ata stored within Duke University Health System will be main tained in an IRB 
approved electronic storage format, as outlined in the RDSP.  
 
Efforts will be made  to protect the confidentiality of all medical records  and other 
personal information to the extent required by [CONTACT_2371] . However, we cannot guarantee 
absolute confidentiality. Patients will be advised in the consent process that the limited 
data set from their MRI will be sent to an outside institution for data a nalysis.  Medical 
records of study  participants are stored and kept according to legal requirements. They 
may be subject to inspection by [CONTACT_941] U.S Food and Drug administration and / or other 
regulatory authorities . A copy of this cons ent form will be put in the subject’s medical 
record. All data will be considered confidential, and  individuals will not be identified in 
any report or publication occurring as a result of this study.

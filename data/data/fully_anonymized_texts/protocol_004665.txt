Introduction 
Background and Rationale  
 The accurate diagnosis of hypertension is essential for targeting appropriate therapy at 
the patients who can most benefit from hypertension treatment. Inappropriate or 
overdiagnosis of hypertension can lead to unnecessary treatment with blood pressure (BP) medications, wasteful healthcare utilization, and adverse psychological consequences fr om labeling with a chronic disease.
1-4  There are challenges with 
measuring BP in the office that make overdiagnosis common. A systematic review found that 5% -65% of patients with elevated office BP do not have high out -of-office  BP 
readings according to home BP monitoring (HBPM) or 24- hour ambulatory BP 
monitoring (ABPM).
5,[ADDRESS_903943] to patients with sustained hypertension (elevated BP in office and ambulatory settings), white -coat hypertension appears to confer little to no increased cardiovascular 
risk.
5,8  Based  primarily on these observations, the USPSTF updated its hypertension 
screening guidelines in 2015 to recommended that patients with elevated office BP undergo ABPM or HBPM to rule- out white -coat hypertension prior to a new diagnosis of 
hypertension.
9 The 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart 
Association BP guidelines had similar recommendations regarding the use of out -of-
office BP testing as part of hypertension diagnosis.10  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_627251], ABPM and HBPM are infrequently utilized as part of hypertension diagnosis in the U.S. In a study of  Medicare beneficiaries, less than 0.1% 
were receiving ABPM, and those few who were billed for ABPM testing were in patients already treated with antihypertensive medications.
11,[ADDRESS_903944] there been any studies of interventions to increase the use of ABPM prior to a hypertension diagnosis. While there is greater use of HBPM in the context of managing hypertension, it is inconsistently used to exclude white-coat hypertension before hypertension 
diagnosis. A recent study examining the use of HBPM in patients with elevated office 
BP but no diagnosis of hypertension found that only 4% were recommended to use HBPM by [CONTACT_669257] 14% had ever used HBPM.
16 Barriers to 
HBPM in the context of hypertension screening were not well characterized, particularly 
in underserved US-based primary care patient populations.  
Of note, in the update to the USPSTF hypertension screening recommendations 
finalized in 2021, masked hypertension was considered as another potential indication 
for out -of-office BP testing as part of hypertension screening.17 Ultimat ely, the panel 
determined that there was insufficient evidence to support screening for masked 
hypertension, but more research was needed, and masked hypertension screening could be recommended in future years. Accordingly, we conducted additional focus 
groups with primary care clinicians to understand clinician barriers to screening for 
masked hypertension, but did not use these data to inform our implementation strategy.  
We endeavored to develop a theory -informed, scalable implementation strategy to 
address barriers to increasing the uptake of the recent USPSTF hypertension 
recommendation, which represents a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of hypertension (i.e., move from relying on office BP to out -of-office testing). The setting  for this work 
was patients and clinicians in a primary care network that serves vulnerable patients in 
an urban setting. To develop a theory -informed strategy, we drew primarily on Michie 
and colleagues’ BCW framework.
[ADDRESS_903945] prompts one to identify both a primary behavior 
and the barriers related to the capability, opportunity, and/or motivation needed to 
influence that target behavior (COM -B). To identify behavioral targets, we first 
conducted nominal groups with primary care clinicians and focus groups with patients from these settings to identify the major barriers to implementation (Phase I). The 
results of these interviews were used to develop an implementation strategy for 
increasing the uptake of the guideline in the ambulatory c are network (ACN) of New 
York-Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] (NYP), a network of 10 primary care clinics serving 
120,000 patients from underserved communities in [LOCATION_001] City  (Phase II). The 
9 
 Behavior Change Wheel implementation science framework was applied to develop this 
strategy. Health system leaders were interviewed to confirm and refine components of the strategy, including the modes of delivery. In Phase III, we conducted a 2.5- year 
cluster randomized trial in which we randomized 4 pairs of ACN clinics (1:1)  to either 
receive the guideline implementation strategy or to a wait -list control. Clinicians and 
patients were assigned to the intervention or control based on their clinic’s allocation. The implementation strategy was evaluated using the RE -AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, 
Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework that combines an assessment of the reach/effectiveness of the intervention for increasing the use of out -of-office BP 
testing prior to hypertension diagnosis (primary outcome) with a mixed- methods 
process evaluation of the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the 
implementation strategy.
20-22  
        
Objectives/Hypothesis  
 
The overarching goal of this research is to conduct a cluster  RCT that will rigorously 
evaluate the effectiveness of a theory -derived multifaceted implementation strategy at 
increasing out -of-office BP testing by [CONTACT_669258].  
 To examine in a cluster randomized trial the effectiveness of a multifaceted 
implementation strategy at increasing out of office BP testing in adult patients 
with elevated office BP but no prior diagnosis of hypertension.  
 
Hypothesis 1 a:    A greater percentage of eligible patients with elevated office BP but 
no diagnosis of hypertension at scheduled primary care visits at intervention clinics will complete out -of-office BP testing [primary outcome] in the post -implementation periods 
as compared to similarly eligible patients from control clinics  
 Hypothesis 1b: A greater percentage of eligible patients with elevated office BP but no 
diagnosis of hypertension at scheduled primary care visits at intervention clinics will have out -of-office BP ordered [secondary outcome] in the post -implementation periods 
as compared to similarly eligible patients from control clinics  
 Hypothesis 1c: A greater percentage of eligible patients with elevated office BP but no 
diagnosis of hypertension at scheduled primary care visits at intervention clinics will have white coat hypertension diagnosed [secondary outcome] in the post -
implementation periods as compared to similarly eligible patients from control clinics  
 
Trial Design  
 
To accomplish this trial’s objectives , we will match 4 pairs of similar primary care clinics  
(as per patient volume and clinic ian mix)  and randomly assign them (1:1) to usual care 
or to implementation of a theory -driven multifaceted implementation strategy designed 
[ADDRESS_903946] and analyze data from the EHR will be blinded to allocation; 
patients and clinicians, however, will be unblinded. For intervention clinics, after allowing for a 6- month implementation period in which the intervention is implemented, 
a cohort of eligible patients will be passively enrolled over [ADDRESS_903947] completion. For control clinics, a 
cohort of eligible patients will similarly be passively enrolled over 12 months during the same time period and then followed for up to 6 months. Corresponding groups of patients in intervention and control clinics will be retrospectively enrolled across 12 months during a 12- month pre- implementation period that occurs prior to the start of the 
implementation of the multifaceted intervention.  
 Figure 1.  Study Timeline  
 
Methods  
Participant, Interventions and Outcomes  
 Healthcare Setting:  
 The trial was conducted in 8 primary care clinics that are part of the Ambulatory Care 
Network (ACN)  of [LOCATION_001] -Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] (NYP) . The ACN serves a 
predominantly low -income, publicly insured population with substantial numbers of 
Hispanic and African American patients. The catchment area includes Upper Manhattan (31% African American; 61% Hispanic descent) and Queens (11% African Amer ican; 
25% Hispanic; 11% Asian/Pacific Islander). Approximately 65% of ACN patients are women, 50% Hispanic, 20% African American, and the mean age is [ADDRESS_903948] Medicaid or are dually eligible (Medicare and Medicaid). The primary care clinics are staffed by a mix of internal medicine physicians, family 
practitioners, nurse practitioners, and graduate medical education (GME) trainees. During the time period of this trial, the clinics used two different electronic health recor ds 
(EHRs), Allscripts (Allscripts Sunrise, Allscripts, Chicago, IL) and EPIC (EPIC systems, Verona, IL), two of the largest health information technology systems in the U.S. Primary care clinics that served adult patients and were part of the NYP ACN were eligible for this trial. To be included, the medical director of the clinic had to agree to participate. Two clinics that were primarily staffed by [CONTACT_426346], one affiliated with Weill Cornell and one with Columbia, were used for pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124] 
11 
 components of the implementation strategy and were therefore excluded from the trial.  
 
Detailed Eligibility Criteria  
 
Clinics  
Inclusion criteria:  
- NYP Ambulatory Care Network primary care clinic (general medicine, family medicine, nurse practitioners, comprehensive care clinic for people living with 
HIV, geriatrics clinic) that provides primary care to adult patients, including people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)  
 
Exclusion criteria:  
- Medical director declines to have the clinic participate in the study  
- Site for pi[INVESTIGATOR_669252] 2015 USPSTF 
recommendations on hypertension screening  
Inclusion criteria:  
• Elevated blood pressure (BP) (systolic BP>=140 mmHg or diastolic BP >=90 
mmHg) at a scheduled clinic visit with a primary care provider from a clinic that is 
participating in the study; if multiple BP readings were taken from a visit, then the 
average of the readings will be used; if sitting and standing BP readings are 
documented as part of an evaluation for orthostatic hypotension, then only the 
sitting BP readings will be averaged 
 
Exclusion criteria (as per manual EHR review by a medically trained member of the research team ): 
• Prior diagnosis of hypertension  
• Prior diagnosis of white- coat hypertension  
• Prior evaluation for white- coat hypertension by 24 -hr ABPM or HBPM  
• Prescribed antihypertensive medication prior to the visit at which patient has 
elevated office BP without diagnosis of hypertension in the medical record  
• Severely elevated office BP (systolic BP>=180 mmHg or diastolic BP>=110 
mmHg); if multiple office BP readings on a given visit, then the mean was used  
• Evidence of target -organ damage (chronic kidney disease as defined by [CONTACT_669259], 
cardiovascular disease)  
• Manual office BP <140/90 mmHg  
12 
  
Interventio n (Multi-Faceted Implementation Strategy) and Control Conditions  
Intervention:  
Following the Behavior Change Wheel framework, the theory -derived multi -faceted 
implementation strategy for increasing the completion of ABPM/HBPM consisted of:  
 
1) accessible ABPM testing service located on the Columbia- campus; of note, ABPM 
testing was available for hypertension screening at a preventive cardiology clinic on the 
Cornell campus, however this clinic only accepted Medicare insurance and it was not 
possible to order testing through a simple EHR order;  
2) presentations for clinicians on how and why to order ABPM and HBPM with 
components designed to address motivational barriers identified in the formative 
qualitative work;  
3) information on how to order  ABPM and HBPM to clinicians via emails and other 
electronic communications;  
4) EHR decision support tools to facilitate ABPM and HBPM test ordering; of note, when 
designing the EHR tools, a pop- up recommending out -of-office BP testing with 
associated orders was not deemed acceptable in the context of “pop -up fatigue”; a Best 
Practice Advisory triggered by [CONTACT_669260], but 
required a clinician to click on the BPA to get connected to resources to facilitate ABPM and HBPM ; 
5) quarterly e- mail clinician feedback about extent of and outcomes of clinic -level 
ABPM, highlighting the common identification of white- coat hypertension through ABPM 
testing; white -coat hypertension was identified in 40% -50% of patients referred for 
ABPM, depending on the clinic and time period. This finding was included in feedback 
emails  
6) brief (<30 min) nurse training on how to teach patients to conduct HBPM;  
7) bilingual patient informational materials to facilitate successful ABPM/HBPM test completion.  
Control:  
Clinics randomized to the wait -list control condition continued to screen and diagnose 
hypertension according to their usual practice without the benefit of the EHR tools or 
other clinician -directed intervention components. Patients from  these clinics, however, 
were still eligible to receive ABPM from the locally available ABPM testing center if referred by [CONTACT_25240], though no special outreach regarding the availability of this service was made as part of this study.  
 Overview of Study Timepoints and Measures  
 
[ADDRESS_903949] and c linic eligibility for participation. 
Clinics that agree to participate were randomized to implementation versus usual care. There was a 6- month period (October 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018) during which the 
clinicians and staff at the clinics randomized to the intervention received the implementation strategy. Over the subsequent [ADDRESS_903950] -implementation period 
(April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019) , patients that had scheduled primary care visits at 
which they had elevated office BP without a prior diagnosis of hypertension were passively enrolled into the trial from implementation and control clinics, with data obtained from the EHR. These patients were then passively followed for up to [ADDRESS_903951] in the year before 
the start of implementation (October 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017). Data for evaluating the 
effectiveness of implementation strategy were  collected passively from the electronic 
health record by [CONTACT_669261]. Additional data to understand implementation outcomes (e.g., fidelity, acceptability) were assessed by [CONTACT_669262] -implementati on period.  
 
Outcomes  
The primary outcome was patient completion of out-of-office BP testing, either ABPM or 
HBPM (Figure 1) .  
The prespecified secondary outcomes were: 
(1) patient  completion  of ABPM testing . 
(2) patient completion of HBPM testing . 
(3) clinician ordered out-of-office BP test ing, either ABPM or HBPM . 
(4) clinician ordered ABPM  testing. 
(5) clinician ordered HBPM  testing. 
Medically -trained chart abstractors reviewed notes from subsequent office visits for 
evidence of ABPM or HBPM testing within 6 months of the visit at which tests were 
ordered. ABPM testing was coded as complete if sufficient awake BP readings (i.e., ≥ 
10 awake BP readings) were available to estimate mean awake BP; asleep readings 
were not required. Determination of ABPM test completion was supplemented using 
data from the clinical ABPM testing service database. Outcome assessments were 
independently coded b y a second assessor, with discrepancies resolved by [CONTACT_21128].  
To better understand natural trends in the adoption of ABPM and HBPM in our primary 
care network prior to testing our implementation strategy, we additionally assessed out -
of-office BP testing  in patients with elevated office BP but no diagnosis of hypertension 
before (2014) and after the publication of the updated USPSTF recommendations 
(2016). Chart review was used to determine whether ABPM or HBPM testing were 
ordered and completed.  
14 
 To better understand why our implementation strategy did or did not work, in May of 
2019 (after the post -implementation period), we e- mailed a survey assessing barriers to 
ABPM and HBPM in the context of hypertension diagnosis to primary care clinicians in 
our ACN network. The survey assessed attitudes towards out -of-office BP testing as 
part of hypertension screening with a focus on barriers that were identified in our 
formative work. The survey also assessed awareness and perceived helpfulness of the 
individual implementation strategy components. To gain a deeper understanding of the 
results of this survey, we conducted interviews with high and low out -of-office BP test 
ordering clinicians to understand why certain barriers remained despi[INVESTIGATOR_669253]. To understand the sustainability of our 
strategy, we planned to assess ABPM and HBPM test ordering and completion in the 
year after the 12- month post -implementation period (i.e., the maintenance period).  
 
Statistica l Approach  
Three closely related hypotheses will be used to test the effectiveness of the 
intervention (i.e., the multifaceted implementation strategy):  
   H1: The rate of out -of-office BP testing during the post -intervention period will be 
higher in clinics that received the intervention than in the control clinics.  
   H2: The rate of out -of-office BP testing within clinics assigned to the intervention 
condition will be higher during the post -intervention period than during the pre-
intervention period. 
   H3: The pre- to post -intervention change in the likelihood of out -of-office BP testing 
will be greater in the clinics that received the intervention than in the control clinics.  
Multilevel Poisson regression model
39,40, where level [ADDRESS_903952] these hypotheses (See Appendix for details). The same approach will be used to evaluate the effect of the intervention on secondary outcomes including the rate of ABPM or HBPM test ordering.  
Process evaluation  
Quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics to assess reach, adoption, and implementation outcomes relevant to the intervention group. Additionally, to assess adoption, multi -level Poisson regression models will be used to compare the proportion 
of clinicians that referred at least one patient for out -of-office BP testing in  intervention 
clinics versus control clinics. To assess implementation, multi -level linear  regression 
models will also  be used to compare clinician ratings of perceived barriers and 
facilitators (7 -point Likert scales) to ordering out -of-office BP testing for guideline- eligible 
patients from intervention clinics versus control clinics; as in the primary  analyses,  
clinics will be treated as a random factor. The equivalent multi -level Poisson regression 
models will be  used to compare intervention clinics versus control clinics in terms of 
clinician reports of whether each individual  intervention c omponent was received 
(yes/no). Finally, an intercept -only multi- level linear regression model will  be used to 
estimate the average “helpfulness” of the intervention, rated on a 4- point Likert scale, 
for intervention  clinics only. Content analysis will be used to evaluate transcripts of key 
stakeholder interviews or focus groups, if  conducted.  
 
[ADDRESS_903953] implementation time 
periods. Conservatively allowing that the rate  of out -of-office BP completion in the usual 
care clinics would increase in the years following the publication of the USPSTF hypertension screening recommendations to as high as 5% of patient visits with newly elevated office BP, we estimated the power to detect a 10% increase in out -of-office BP 
completion rate due to the intervention (i.e., relative risk 3.0; 15% vs 5%), at a two-tailed, α=0.[ADDRESS_903954] size. According to these simulations, the study has >84% power to detect the hypothesized RR=3.0 (15% completion rate in intervention clinics vs 5% in control clinics) for hypothesis H1, the comparison of post -intervention completion rates. The 
study also has >92% power to detect the hypothesized RR=3.0 (15% post -intervention 
completion rate vs 5% pre- intervention) for hypothesis H2, the test of the change in 
completion rate for intervention clinics only. Finally, the study has approximately 80% power to detect the hypothesized Condition*Period interaction effect based on plausible assumptions in variation and correlation in out -of-office BP testing completion rates 
between clinics.
41 
Recruitment  
Clinics were recruited through communications with the ACN leaders (Director of Ambulatory Care, medical directors) that could decide whether clinics  should participate 
in the trial. These health system leaders  were provided with details of the 
implementation strategy prior to formally enrolling in the trial.  
As the intervention that the implementation strategy seeks to promote is evidence-based and considered quality improvement, a waiver of informed consent was obtained so that patients and clinicians did not need to be directly consented into the trial. For the primary analyses, we passively “enrolled” a sample of intervention group patients with elevated office BP but no diagnosis of hypertension at scheduled office visits over a 12-
mo pre- implementation period, and again over a 12- mo post -implementation period 
after a 6 -mo transition period during which the multifaceted strategy was implemented, 
and we then “followed” each of these patients for up to 6- months after the eligible 
patient visit to assess for test completion. The same procedure was used to enroll control group patients from the control clinics during the pre- and post -implementation 
control periods.  
Assignment of Interventions  
 
Randomization and Allocation  
Clinics with similar properties were matched in pairs in terms of clinic volume of patients 
and clinician -training (e.g., HIV, inclusion of trainees) mix. We then randomly assigned 
clinics within these pairings to  implementation (intervention) or usual care. Computer generated random allocation in SAS was used to assign clinics. Randomization 
16 
 assignment became visible to the study team only after the randomization sequence 
was determined. Clinicians and patients were considered unblinded to treatment allocation. Personnel who extracted and analyzed quantitative data for study outcomes 
were blinded. To avoid contamination during the pre- implementation period, the 
randomization sequence and crossover date were  concealed from clinics until the start 
of the imp lementation period, and  final intervention details, trainings, and marketing 
materials were only  shared at the start of the implementation  period.  
Sequence generation  
Clinic s were randomly assigned to one of two groups:  intervention or control.   
Concealment Mechanism  
Clinics will be assigned a study code and randomized using a computer generated random allocation. Concealment will be ensured as the randomization algorithm will run in the backend, and only the randomization assignment will be visible to the unblinded 
implementation team. Clinic assignments will be made by a study statistician who has 
no role in intervention development or implementation. The study team charged with 
implementation will have no ability to influence allocation assignme nts. 
Blinding Randomization assignments w ere made  by [CONTACT_669263]. This individual followed the code generated by [CONTACT_4305].  Thus, randomization allocation will be concealed 
from the study statistician ([CONTACT_19072]) and Data Management Team (unless the code needs to be broken), until the point that finalized datasets are locked.  Importantly, the 
medically trained data extractors were also blinded to group assignment by [CONTACT_669264].  
[ADDRESS_903955] -Implementation Period Assessments 
Research data for the study include:  
• Electronic medical record (EMR) data extraction relevant to patient 
characteristics of eligible patients , out-of-office BP test ordering  by [CONTACT_669265],  and out-of-office BP test completion  by [CONTACT_1962]  
• ABPM testing service data from the Columbia- site, to confirm no ABPM test 
orders or completion were missed  
• Clinician survey to assess clinician characteristics (age, gender, years since completed training) as well as clinician perceptions toward barriers to out -of-
office BP testing following the post -implementation period  
• Clinician interviews to better understand clinician attitudes toward the 
implementation strategy  components  
 Post- implementation period (April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019)  assessments of out -of-
office BP testing took place by [CONTACT_669266]. Key study outcomes were then coded through 
manual chart extraction.  
 Pre-implementation period (October 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017)  assessments of out -of-
office BP testing took place by [CONTACT_669266]. Key study outcomes were then coded through manual chart extraction.  
 Only medically -trained individuals wi ll be eligible to manually extract data from the 
electronic medical record. These individuals will be blinded to group assignment.  
 Data Management  
Data Entry, Security and Storage  
A dedicated, HIPAA -compliant, web- based data entry system  called REDCap  will be 
used for this study. Data coding will occur separately at Cornell and Columbia. Cornell 
[ADDRESS_903956] any inconsistency, or by [CONTACT_669267]. The local sites’ study  personnel will be responsible for 
updating and correcting the data entry in the web- based system . 
Statistical Methods 
All analyses will use the principle of intention- to-treat. Baseline patient characteristics 
will be examined as means  (standard deviation) or percentages by [CONTACT_669268]  a balanced allocation. Also, clinician characteristics will be 
compared across group assignment.  
 
Effectiveness of intervention.  The relative change, from the 12- month pre-intervention 
period to the 12- month  post-intervention period, in the percentage of patient visits after 
which guideline- eligible patients complete out -of-office BP testing  (either ABPM or 
HBPM) will be the primary outcome measured at the clinic level. This change will be 
estimated using a multilevel Poisson regression model(1, 2)  in which level [ADDRESS_903957] -intervention 12- month period, 
and each observation will include:  
1) the outcome: the number of patients who completed out -of-office BP testing 
within six months of an eligible visit that occurred within the given 12 -month 
period,  
2) the total number of unique eligible patient -visits during the given 12- month period 
(used as an “offset” variable, after log -transformation, in the Poisson regression), 
and 
3) two binary predictors, Condition (0=control site, 1=intervention site) and Period (0=pre -intervention, 1=post -intervention).  
The model will include two correlated random intercepts, one to capture site-specific differences (i.e., clustering by [CONTACT_3725]) during the pre- intervention period and one for the 
post-intervention period. We considered a much more complex model that would 
include random effects for each individual physician, but recent work suggests that it is sufficient to model only clustering at the highest level of analysis at which clustering is assumed to occur. (3) Using a log link function, we will estimate the following model:  
 ln(OOO_BP
sp) = α sp + β 1*Condition s + β 2*Period p + β 3*Condition s*Period p (1) 
Where,  s indexes clinic sites, s = [ADDRESS_903958] three closely related hypotheses:  
1) The rate of out -of-office BP completion during the post -intervention period will be 
higher in clinics that received the intervention than in the control clinics.  Exp(β 1 + 
β3) equals the relative risk (RR) of out -of-office BP assessment in intervention 
compared to control clinics during the post -intervention period, and testing the 
hypothesis that β 1 + β 3 = 0 is equivalent to testing the hypothesis that this 
RR=1.0.  
2) The rate of out -of-office BP completion within clinics assigned to the intervent ion 
condition will be higher during the post -intervention period than during the pre-
intervention period.  Exp(β 2 + β 3) equals the RR of out -of-office BP assessment 
in during the post -intervention period compared to the pre- intervention period, 
within the clinics assigned to the intervention condition, and testing the 
hypothesis that β 2 + β 3 = 0 is equivalent to testing the hypothesis that this 
RR=1.0.  
3) The Pre - to Post - change in the likelihood of out -of-office BP testing will be 
greater in the clinics that  received the intervention than in the control clinics. β 3, 
the coefficient of the interaction term, estimates the extent to which the Pre- to 
Post- change in the likelihood of out -of-office BP testing is greater in the clinics 
that received the intervention than in the control clinics. More specifically, if RR [ADDRESS_903959]-interv ention period, then e xp(β 3) equals RR 1/RR 0, 
and testing the hypothesis that exp(β 3) =0 is equivalent to testing the hypothesis 
that RR 1/RR 0 = 1. 
Although we anticipate that the matching of clinics will have promoted balance between those clinics assigned to the intervention and control conditions, we will not incorporate the matching into the analysis. The same approach will be used to evaluate the effect of the intervention on secondary outcomes including the rate of ABPM or HBPM referrals as well as to determine maintenance of the effect of the intervention in the second year after implementation (the maintenance period).  
 Sensitivity Analysis  
The USPSTF hypertension screening guidelines do not specify how to determine whether office BP is elevated, though they do note that office BP has variability, and averaging office BP or seeing a pattern of elevated office BP across two or more office visits might be appropriate for determining elevated office BP prior to ordering out -of-
office BP testing. Accordingly, we will perform sensitivity analyses by [CONTACT_669269] o ffice visit as well as at the eligible office visit.  
 To better understand differences in implementation and usual care within individual clinics, we will also explore outcomes at the clinic level.

 Data Monitoring 
 
Since EMBRACE  represents the implementation of a strategy designed to increase the 
uptake of an evidence- based practice, since the delivery of this strategy was deemed to 
be associated with minimal risks, and since the trial will not involve prospective enrollment of patient or providers and clinical outcomes will not be prospectively assessed, the randomized trial is not a “clinical trial” according to the Public Health Service definition and does not require a Dat a Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB).  
 Harms 
While no serious harms were expected, given that intervention patients could conceivable be more likely to experience harms from ABPM testing in terms of severe bruising or other unexpected adverse event from ABPM testing, we did query our ABPM 
testing service database and ask the medically -trained chart extractors to note if there 
were any unanticipated AEs that must be reported to the IRB according to standard 
guidelines.  
 Any AE or unanticipated problem will be identified, responded to, recorded by [CONTACT_6962], who will  in turn ensure that the information is passed on. If the AE or 
problem is unexpected, related to study involvement, and puts the participant at increased risk, it will be reported to the local IRB immediately, in accordance with local 
policies. These events wi ll also be reported to Columbia University  IRB. 
 
Auditing  
Routine audits of data completion and timeliness will be overseen by [CONTACT_669270].  
Ethics and Dissemination  
 
Research Ethics Approval  
This protocol  has been  approved by [CONTACT_669271] ’s and 
Weill  Cornell  Medicine’s  Institutional  Review  Board (IRB) with respect to scientific  
content  and compliance with applicable research  and human  subjects regulations.  Each 
study  site must  submit  verification  of IRB approval  to the Columbia  site prior to the 
initiation  of study  activities.  
 
Subsequent  to initial review  and approval,  Columbia University’s  and Weill Cornell’s  IRB 
will review  the protocol  at least  annually.  The overall  PI [INVESTIGATOR_669254].  These reports  will 
include the total number  of participants  enrolled, reports  of any adverse events,  and any 
other  requested  reports.  
 
Protocol Amendments  
Any modifications to the protocol which may impact on the conduct of the study, 
potential benefit of the patient or may affect patient safety, including changes of study 
21 
 objectives, study design, patient population, sample sizes, study procedures, or 
significant administrative aspects will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Such amendment will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_28778], site PIs and co- investigators, and 
approved by [CONTACT_669272].  
 Administrative changes of the protocol are minor corrections and/or clarifications that have no effect on the way the study is to be conducted. These administrative changes will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_28778] [INVESTIGATOR_669255], and will be documented in a memorandum. The responsible IRBs may be notified of administrative changes at the 
discretion of the PIs.  
Informed Consent  
The protocol and informed consent procedures will be approved by [CONTACT_669273]. Given the minimal risk nature of the study, a waiver of informed consent was obtained for extracting patient data from medic al records in conjunction with assessing primary and secondary outcomes of the 
effectiveness of this study’s implementation strategy. A signed informed consent was not required for clinician surveys as again, these surveys were optional, voluntary, and conferred no risk. Further, completion of the survey was deemed to indicate consent.  
 A verbal informed consent was obtained prior to telephone interviews with clinicians eligible for this trial to gain a deeper understanding of attitudes toward the implemen tation strategy after the post -implementation period. At the time of enrollment, 
the staff member conducting these interviews would give a complete description of the 
study to the participant in clear, easy -to-understand language. After reading and 
underst anding the consent and the procedures, those who choose to participate will 
give their verbal consent to proceed with the interview.  
 All staff involved in this study will have completed and passed GCP and HIPAA training, and will have been provided with materials and instruction in the proper and ethical manner in which consent should be obtained. When telephone consent is obtained, it 
will comply with all GCP and HIPAA re gulations, and be IRB -approved. 
 
Confidentiality  
As part of the process involved in obtaining written informed consent, all  participants will 
be reminded that their responses are confidential and that they may refuse to participate 
in the study or withdraw at any time without explanation, and further, that such an action will in no way affect their future interactions with their participating Medical Center.  
 
To ensure confidentiality, all study -related information will be stored securely at the 
study sites. When paper records are obtained, those containing names or other 
personal identifiers, such as locator forms, medical records, and informed consent 
forms, will be stored separately from study records identified by [CONTACT_236158]. 
Forms, lists, logbooks, appointment books, and any other listings that link participant ID 
numbers to other identifying information will be stored in a separate, locked file in an 
area with limited access. All databases will be secured with password- protected access 
systems. Datasets for analysis will be associated with an individual participant only by 
[CONTACT_330573].  
[ADDRESS_903960] participants (Good Clinical Practice).  
Declaration of Interests All investigative staff has reported any conflicts of interest  to their local IRB as part of 
the protocol approval process.  
Access to data Only authorized personnel, those who have official status as part of the authorized research team, will have access to any records containing identifiable participant data. Study personnel at local sites will only have access to their own site’s data, and will be limited by [CONTACT_2030] “user -roles” (i.e. Weill Cornell study personnel will only have access to 
Weill Cornell p atien t data, blinded data extractors will not have access to group 
allocation).The Quantitative Data Committee  will oversee the intra- study data sharing 
process.  
Dissemination policy  
Study results will be posted at ClinicalTrials.Gov within or as soon after one year of 
study completion as is possible . A Publications and Disseminations  Committee will be 
formed, and this committee will then create a policy/guideline for authorship and review 
process of manuscripts and abstracts for publication or conference presentations.

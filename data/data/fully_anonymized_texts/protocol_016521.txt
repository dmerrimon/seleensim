well as resting mPAP, pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469] 
(PCWP) at rest and with submaximal exercise, right atrial 
pressure at rest and with submaximal exercise, and an 
increase in pulmonary artery compliance at rest and with 
submaximal exercise (all secondary endpoints) .

1.[ADDRESS_477266] for PH therapeutics  
Reduced bioavailability and impaired 
production of nitric oxide (NO) are thought to 
contribute to th e development of both 
metabolic syndrome and PH. [1-6] An 
increasing number of therapeutic approaches, 
which enhance NO generation and bioactivity, 
have been proposed over the past decade and  
include administration of nitrite and nitrate. [7] 
Nitrite, the ac tive metabolite of dietary nitrate, 
has been recognized as a natural reservoir of 
NO.[7],[8] This is now referred to as the 
nitrate -nitrite -NO pathway and involves a 
series of oxygen -independent and NO  
synthase -independent single electron transfer reactions. [7] Nitrate  accumulates in the plasma 
from oral intake of foods rich in nitrate,  such as green leafy vegetabl es and root plants, or from 
the intravascular oxidation of NO to nitrate by [CONTACT_380969] ( Figure 1). Nitrate is then 
concentrated in the saliva and reacts with oral commensal bacteria, which contain nitrate

 reductase enzymes. [7, 9]  Humans do not possess nitrate reductase enzymes so require these  
bacteria for conversion of nitrate to nitrite. Nitrite is then swallowed and systemically absorbed 
where it can be  further reduced via one -electron transfer reactions with hemoglobin, 
myoglobin, neuroglobin , and molybopterrin -containing enzymes (such as xanthine oxidase, 
aldehyde oxidase and mARC). [10-13] Nitrite has now been shown to regulate blood pressure, 
hypoxic vasodilation, mitochondrial efficiency, and exercise performance. From a therapeutic 
standpoint, nitrite has been shown to exhibit therapeutic efficacy in mouse, rat, and sheep 
pre-clinical mod els of PH. [14-16] Additionally, oral supplementation of nitrate and nitrite 
prevents the development of hypoxia - and monocrotaline -induced PH in mice. [17]  
Furthermore, a recent study suggests that dietary supplementation of nitrate reverses the 
features of metabolic syndrome in eNOS -deficient mice, yet the mechanism behind this 
observation and the role of nitrite on metabolic syndrome remain uncertain. [18]  
 
Nitrate -nitrite -NO signaling improves exercise capacity and efficiency  
In addition to effects on improving pulmonary hypertension, nitrate and nitrate -containing 
foods such as beet root juice , and purified nitrate solutions, improve exercise efficiency (3 -6% 
increase VO2/watts), exercise time to exhaustion (≈16%), increase tolerance to high intensity 
exercise (≈25%), and improve mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratios). [19-21] Studies in highly 
trained athletes show that higher plasma baseline levels of nitrite are associated with superior 
exercise capacity and nitrate therapy increases time trial performance (the time required to 
achieve a pre -specified work level) for several  sports. [22-33] A recent meta -analysis of [ADDRESS_477267] of inorganic nitrate supplementation on exercise performance 
for several types of exercise, including cycling, walking, running, and knee extension exercise, 
showed a significant benefit on perf ormance for ti me to exhaustion tests , performance for time 
trials, and graded exercise tests. [26] Studies in patients with cardiopulmonary disease are 
now being published including a recently completed trial of a high nitrate containing beet root 
juice in 15 subjects with COPD (placebo -controlled cross over trial) that increased plasma 
nitrite levels by 379% and increased median submaximal constant work rate exercise time by 
28.8 seconds. [34] A recently completed study evaluated a single dose of 12.9 mmoles of 
nitrate in beetroot juice compared with nitrate depleted juice in a double -blinded placebo -
controlled cross over trial of HFpEF patients without PH and found significant increases in 
exercise duration, VO2 max, and total work performed. [35, 36]  These studies provide relevant 
background to test oral nitrite in this longer term trial  and we expect additional benefit in the 
targeted enrollment population of patients with HFpEF that also have an increased pulmonary 
vascular resistance and metabolic syndrome.  
 
Sirtuins and AMPK as regulators of metabolism, activated by [CONTACT_380970] a cellular energy sensor that participat es in many 
metabolic processes, and controls liver and skeletal muscle 
insulin receptor -independent glucose uptake. [37] Dysregulation 
of AMPK and its signali ng network have been associated both 
with metabolic syndrome and idiopathic PAH. [38-41] Several 
studies have  shown that NO donors increase glucose uptake 
and GLUT4 expression via AMPK  activation, [42, 43]  and our 
group has  shown that nitrite increases AMPK  activation in 
cardiomyo cytes, identifying AMPK as a candidate signaling 
pathway  for the effects of nitrate and nitrite on glucose 
homeostasis. [44] As shown in Figure  2, activation of AMPK can 
be mediated by [CONTACT_380971], including liver  kinase B1 
(LKB1), calcium -sensitive calmodulin -dependent protein kinase II  (CaMKII), 
calcium/calmodulin -dependent protein kinase -beta (CaMKK β), and TGFβ-activated kinase -1 
(TAK1). [45-47] Recently, sirtuin -3 (SIRT3), a major mitochondrial deacetylase that is

V14.0  02/14/2022   
 upregulated in skeletal muscle with exercise, has been shown to activate AMPK in skeletal 
muscle and neurons. [48-50] On the basis of such observations, we hypothesize that nitrite, 
similar to metformin, might improve metabolic syndrome via the activation of AMPK signaling 
pathways. In the skeletal muscle, we propose that nitrite and metformin activate mitochondrial 
SIRT 3, which in turn promotes the phospho rylation and activation of AMPK and membrane 
translocation of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). Nitrite also directly activates pulmonary 
vascular smooth muscle AMPK via alternative SIRT3 -independent pathways that will  be 
carefully explored. Systemic improvements in metabolic syndrome and localized effects on 
the pulmonary vasculature suggest that nitrite may be an ideal therapy for PH -HFpEF in the 
setting of metabolic syndrome.  
 
Development of sodium nitrite administration for human use  
A phase 1a and 1b dose escalation study designed to  define the maximum tolerated and safe 
doses of inhaled sodium nitrite delivered to normal volunteers following electronic nebulization  
has shown an increase in heart rate (+24  ± 5 bpm) without clinically significant changes in 
systolic ( -3 ± 2 mmHg) or diastolic ( -3 ± 2 mmHg) blood pressure at the m aximal  tolerated 
dose (MTD of 125 mg). [51] At the highest delivered dose (176 mg), there was a significant 
decrease in systemic blood pressure and increase in heart rate . Reduction of nitrite to NO 
was demonstrated by [CONTACT_380972]. Methemoglobin levels increased at the 
highest doses administered, but remained less than 3.5% in all subjects. Pharmacokinetic 
modeling demonstrated  dose -proportional increases in peak and AUC plasma nitrite. There 
is an ongoing  phase 2 study  (clinicaltrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) of inhaled nitrite therapy in 
patients with group II PH (PH -HFpEF), Group I PAH, and Group III  PH (PH due to lung 
disease), with data suggesting likely efficacy in  patients with  PH-HFpEF  at doses of both 45 
and 90 mg .[52-54] We have also now  completed phase 1 safety and PK analys es of a newly 
developed  FDA-IND approved oral nitrite pr eparation in normal volunteers, with and without 
15-nitrogen labeling  (both with matching placebos) .[55, 56]  The oral bioavailabili ty of nitrite is 
excellent (95 -98%) and similar to intravenous delivery. [57] An ongoing safety and efficacy trial 
of 3 months of treatment with oral nitrite (20 mg, twice daily) in patients with metabolic 
syndrome (clinical trials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) continues to accrue.  
 
1.4 SIGNIFICANCE  
Group II pulmonary hypertension (PH) or post -capi[INVESTIGATOR_380942] (LV) systolic or diastolic dysfunction. The latter is 
more commonly referred to as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or n on-
systolic heart failure, and is the most common cause of Group II PH. With chronic elevations 
in the diastolic filling pressure of the left heart, the pulmonary vasculature can vasoconstrict 
and undergo pathological remodeling and secondary right ventric ular (RV) hypertrophy and 
dilation, leading to an elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and high transpulmonary 
pressure gradients .[58-61] It is now appreciated that features of the metabolic syndrome, 
including systemic hypertension, obesity, diabetes , and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], represent risk factors 
for the development of pulmonary vascular disease.  In fact, patients with pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (Group I PAH) exhibit an increased prevalence of glucose intolerance (increased 
hemoglobin A1c levels). [60-64]  Patients with Group II PH -HFpEF commonly present with two 
or more features of the metabolic syndrome .[63]  Mouse models of metabolic syndrome, such 
as the apo E knock -out mice fed a high fat diet, have been shown to develop pulmonary 
hypertension. [65] There are no currently approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_380943] -HFpEF and most 
medications approved for Group I PAH have been shown to be ineffective in patients with left 
heart disease.  New therapi[INVESTIGATOR_380944] -clinical models and in patients, including peroxisome 
proliferator -activated receptor -γ activators, and , in our studies , metformin and

associated with metabolic syndrome and no specific therapy for patients with PH -HFpEF.

measurements will determine subject’s eligibility.  Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria, 
and none of the exclusion criteria,  will be included in the study . Once eligibility is confirmed, 
subjects will complete a series of baseline procedures prior to receiving study drug. The study 
population (n= 26) will receive either oral sodium nitrite or matching placebo as follows:  
 
Drug :  The study drugs are oral formulation of sodium nitrite and matching placebo. Sodium 
nitrite is available in dose strengths of 20 mg and 40 mg. Sodium nitrite of both dose 
strengths and matching placebo will be supplied as capsules for oral administration. All 
capsule formulations will be identical in appearance (size, shape, color) and smell. The 
packaging and labeling will be designed to maintain blinding to the Investigator’s team and 
to subjects.  Oral formulation of sodium nitrite , total dose stre ngth of  40 mg or placebo three 
times daily or TID (once in the morning and again in the early afternoon and again in the 
evening).  
 
During the treatment period , subjects wil l undergo periodic  clinical evaluations  and weekly 
follow -up phone calls in  between clinic visits.   Throughout the study period, subjects will be 
asked to remain diligent in recording in a diary the date and time of study drug dosing and any 
associated symptoms.  
 
2.2.1. Study Drug Preparation and Distribution

out period , the subjects will cross -over to receive the alternative therapy (nitrite or matching 
placebo) and undergo  the same  study procedures as noted for the 1st 10 weeks.  Subjects will 
be given a diary to monitor study drug administration and will be asked to return the diary  at 
each clinic visit to monitor complianc e.  Upon completion of the cross -over portion of the trial, 
subjects will be given the option to receive open -label drug for 6 months.   
 
2.2.3. Safety Monitoring:  
Weekly p hone follow -up (+/- 7 days) assessments will occur  while  on active study treatment  
(when subjects are not followed up in clinic)  that will include symptom review, assess ment of  
adverse events , review of concomitant medications,  and interval histories.  Subjects may 
return to clinic for  outpatient  assessments at weeks 4  and 8 (both Arm 1 and Arm 2) if the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_380946] . No weekly phone follow up may 
be necessary if subjects are evaluated in clinic.  Clinical visits are completed in  the outpatient 
clinics at UPMC Presby[CONTACT_380973]/or Falk Clinic, Comprehensive Lung 
Center , or Translational  Research Center ( TRC).  The in-person clinical visits include  a brief 
physical exam , NYHA functional class assessment, vital signs including oxygen  and 
methemoglobin levels via co-oximetry, NTproBNP lab, 6MWT and Borg scale, interval 
histories , medication compliance review, AE assessment/ symptom review , and dispensing of

In addition to these formal evaluations, subjects will be encouraged to immediately contact 
[CONTACT_63789]/or the study coordinator with questions, concerns, or to report new 
symptoms that occur during their study participation. If there are particular concerns that need 
to be addressed sooner than the in -person visit s, the subject will be asked to return to the 
clinic  as soon as possible for evaluation. If appropriate, based upon the evaluation, medical 
treatments will be provided to subjects, including appropriate referral to physicians or other 
services at the UPMC .  
 
2.2.4. Medication Compliance  
Randomization to study drug verses placebo will occur after eligibility has been confirmed by 
[CONTACT_380974]. Randomization of sequence of 
nitrite -placebo versus placebo -nitrite followed by [CONTACT_12783] -over to the alternative treatment in a

of the physician inv estigator  or the primary study coordinator after eligibility has been 
confirmed.   
 
Subjects will also be dispensed their study medication for home use  and a diary to track drug 
administration . Subjects will return the previously dispensed study medi cation  and diary  at 
every study visit thereafter, and medication compliance will be assessed  
 
The study investigator and/or the study coordinator will review the daily diary. In the event that 
the compliance rate is < 80%, subjects will be re -educated on medication compliance. If 
medication compliance falls outside of the acceptable range  more than [ADDRESS_477271] eligibility for continued participation in the study.

2.3.5.   Open Label Period  
Upon completion of the end of treatment visit , subjects will be given the option to receive open -
label drug for 6 months.  Subjects will receive open -label of Oral Nitrite ( NO2−). Subjects may be 
asked to return monthly for blood pressure, methemoglobin checks  (optional) . Oral nitrite will be 
dispe nsed at each of these visits. Patients will be asked to return in -person for  month 3 and 
month 6 of the open label period, and will be asked to complete 3 questionnaires (KCCQ, SF -
36, and PAH -SYMPACT), perform a six -minute walk test, and have a blood collection  to 
measure NT-proBNP level. The total amount of blood drawn is  4ml.  
 
Currently HFpEF is a disease with no approved treatments. The main purpose of the open label 
period is to provide specific treatment to those patients that have a response during the 
crossover trial. This can also be a benefit to the patients if they are getting relief from their 
symptoms from the ora l nitrite. It will also provide longer term safety data. Patient reported 
outcomes such as QOL are collected.

▪ Spi[INVESTIGATOR_380949] [ADDRESS_477293] (6MWT  and Borg Scale ) 
The six -minute walk test (6MWT) will be conducted in accordance with local standard 
operating procedures. The 6MWT measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a 
total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface .  The subject  is allowed to self -pace and rest as 
needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway.   The test is used as a 
performance -based measure of functional exercise capacity.  It evaluates the global and 
integrated responses of all the systems invo lved during exercise, including the pulmonary and 
cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular 
units, and muscle metabolism. The self -paced 6MWT assesse s the submaximal level of 
functional capacity. Most subjects do not achieve maximal exercise capacity during the 
6MWT; instead, they choose their own intensity of exercise and are allowed to stop and rest 
during the test. However, because most activities o f daily living are performed at submaximal 
levels of exertion, the 6MW T may best reflect the functional exercise level for daily physical 
activities.  
 
The Borg Scale is a method of rating perceived exertion during exercise and will be used while 
the subject performs  a 6MWT.  
 
2.4.3 Accelerometer  
Physical activity: The SenseWear Pro Armband Accelerometer (BodyMedia, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA 
and/or Actigraph , Pensacola, FL ) multi -sensor device will be used to provide an objective 
measure of physical activity for about 7-[ADDRESS_477294] of the Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) maneuver. A 
trained pulmonary function technician will administer the pulmonary function testing. The FVC 
is the maximal volume of air exhaled with a maximally forced effort from a maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. 
The FVC maneuver will be performed using the Easy on -PC (NDD)  with the  subject in a seated 
position. Within the FVC maneuver, the maximal volume of air exhaled in the first second of 
a forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FEV1) will be obtained as w ell. The best of three efforts will be defined as 
the highest  FEV1 and the  highest FVC, each obtained on any of three efforts  that meet  the 
American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for acceptability and repeatability criteria (with a 
maximum of eight attempts). The highest FEV1 and FVC will be selected regardless of 
whether they come from different spi[INVESTIGATOR_380950].  
 
If the ratio of FEV1/FVC is less than 0.70, then salbutamol (albuterol) will be administered. 
After a gentle and incomplete expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], a dose of 100 μg of salbutamol (albuterol) is inhaled

intervals. Three additional, acceptable post -bronchodilator FVC manoeuver tests will be  
recorded [ADDRESS_477296] dose of sa lbutamol (albuterol) is inhaled.  
  
2.4.[ADDRESS_477297] ing (CPET)  and Gas Exchange Measurements:  
CPET will be performed using an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer (Ergoline 800, 
SensorMedics) and the gas exchange measurements will be analyzed using the Viasys Vmax 
Encore metabolic cart system.  
CPET at baseline will consist of an incremental exercise test (IET) and a constant work rate 
test for practice (CWR P). The CWR P test will determine the constant workrate ( CWR ) that will 
be used at baseline, Week 1 0, crossover , and EOT . 
 
Determining Workload (WL) and CWR at Baseline  
• IET:The work rate will increase in a stepwise manner, using an  individualized incremental 
WL (based on age, height, weight, and gender) to  achieve a targeted duration of [ADDRESS_477298] 
multiple of 5 watts [69].  
 
• CWR P: A resting period of at least [ADDRESS_477299].  
The CWR P will be performed  around 70-75% of the maximal WL from  the IET [70, 71] . 
Further adjustment in CWR will be based on the exercise endurance time  (ET) of CWR P 
to optimize CWR  at baseline, Week [ADDRESS_477300]  will be 
optional.  
 
CPET for baseline, Week 1 0, crossover , and EOT  
The CWR determined from CWR P will be used for baseline, Week 1 0, crossover , and EOT. 
ET will be measured from the start of loaded pedaling to volitional exhaustion and the WL has 
returned to unloaded pedaling. The endurance exercise challenge will be used to compare 
oral nitrite to placebo.  
 
CPET  will measure the integrated response of the pulmonary mechanics, gas exchange, 
cardio/pulmonary vascular, peripheral muscle systems, and the subject’s perceived exertion. 
For each subject, isotime measurements of cardiopulmonary metabolic responses will be 
compared over th e minimum ET of Week [ADDRESS_477301] form. 
A detailed description of the CPET procedures is provided by [CONTACT_380980].  
Emergency equipment including a defibrillator will be readily available.  
2.4.6 Laboratory Testing  
The following peripheral blood samples will be evaluated at  the screening/baseline,  week 10, 
cross-over, and end of treatment  visits  for follow -up comparison purposes : fasting glucose, 
comprehensive metabolic panel, hemoglobin A1C, fasting lipid profile, PT/PTT, complete 
blood count, platelet and differential, NT -proBNP , and research blood samples  for plasma

V14.0  02/14/[ADDRESS_477302] will be performed on female s of child -bearing potential at baselin e, week 1 0, cross-over 
visit, and at the end of study treatment.  The samples will be collected and analyzed at the 
UPMC  Presby[CONTACT_380981] . The NT -proBNP blood sample will be sent to the 
Translational Research Core Laboratory (TRCL) for storage and analysis.  Research samples  
will be sent to Shiva/Gladwin labs in Vascular Medicine Institute (VMI) for storage and 
analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Research Laboratory Profiles  
Blood samples for platelet mitochondrial analysis , plasma nitrite concentrations and red cell 
iron-nitrosyl -hemoglobin  may be collected at screening/ baseline, Week  10, crossover , and 
EOT visits . These de -identified blood samples will be sent to the Shiva/Gladwin labs in the 
Vascular Medicine Institute for storage and analysi s under the supervision of Drs. Gladwin , 
Risbano, and Shiva .  
2.4.7 Methemoglobin Levels  
The Masimo Rainbow SET® CO-Oximeter device that will be used in this clinical trial has been 
validated to provide accurate determinations of methemoglobin levels under conditions of 
hypoxia and methemoglobinemia. Measurements will be obtained before  initial dose and 
approximately 30-[ADDRESS_477303] metHb levels.  
  
2.4.8 Right Heart Catheterization , Simultaneous Pressure and Doppler Flow Velocity 
Measurement , and Exercise RHC  
Right heart catheterization (RHC) is performed routinely as a clinical standard of care 
procedure for diagnostic purposes in this disease population. The standard right heart 
catheterization is performed with a balloon tipped, flow -directed pulmonary arter y catheter 
(Swan -Ganz catheter), inserted through a sheath in the internal jugular vein. As per standard 
clinical protocol, hemodynamic recordings of right atrial, right ventricular, pulmonary artery 
pressures, pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469], in additi on to cardiac output, are made at 
baseline.    
RHC may be completed at screening for eligibility purposes, week [ADDRESS_477304] .   
Subjects may  also undergo additional hemodynamic measurements using a micromanometer 
pressure catheter that may be inserted via the Swann -Ganz catheter distal port.  
Measurements with micromanometer and/or Swann -Ganz catheter may be made with 
simultaneous flow velocity from transthoracic echocardiographic doppler ultrasound at resting  
and after the exercise portion of RHC. This portion of the study that involves the 
micromanometer instrumentation is expected to add an additional 5 -10 minutes onto the 
proced ure at each time point.  
Cardiac output  (CO)  is the amount of blood pumped through the left ventricle of the heart in 
a time interval of one minute.  There are a number of ways to calculate CO.  Thermodilution 
and/or Fick cardiac index are two means that will be used for measuring CO for this 
protocol.  The CO will be the average of the recorded CO collected.    
Study Short Title:  Oral Nitrite in Patients with PH -HFpEF   Sponsor: Mark T. Gladwin, MD      
PI: M ichael Risbano , MD  
STUDY20010014  
Page 22 of 47 
V14.0  02/14/2022   
 Cardiac index  (CI) is a measurement that relates the CO from the left ventricle to body 
surface area (BSA) , therefore determining cardiac function to size of the individual.  CI is 
calculated by [INVESTIGATOR_609]/BSA.  
Pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469] (PCWP) provides an indirect estimate of left atrial 
pressure (LAP). PCWP is measured by [CONTACT_380982] -tipped, multi -lumen catheter (Swan -
Ganz catheter) while it is in a branch of the pulmonary artery. Just behind the tip of  the 
catheter is a small balloon that can be inflated with air (~1 cc). The catheter has one 
opening (port) at the tip (distal to the balloon) and a second port several centimeters 
proximal to the balloon. These ports are connected to pressure transducers.  When properly 
positioned in a branch of the pulmonary artery, the distal port measures pulmonary artery 
pressure and the proximal port measures right atrial pressure. The balloon is then inflated, 
which occludes the branch of the pulmonary artery. When th is occurs, the pressure in the 
distal port rapi[INVESTIGATOR_380951], and after several seconds, reaches a stable lower value that is very 
similar to left atrial pressure (normally about 8 -10 mmHg). The balloon is then deflated and 
pulmonary artery pressure can again be recorded. The same catheter can be used to 
measure cardiac output . Anticoagulants would need to be held prior to the right heart 
catheterization as this is standard clinically for that procedure. Antiplatelets and beta 
blockers are continued, also clinical standard of care. We will be holding only the morning 
dose of oral hypoglycemics for all non -insulin dependent diabetics until they complete the 
study later that morning - this is also standard clinically for this procedure. Holding diuretics

This visit will take place in  the Montefiore CTRC.  This test will occur at least [ADDRESS_477306] exercise bout to account for the effects of acute exercise on insulin resistance. 
Subjects will be asked not to drink or eat anything o ther than plain water for 8 hours prior to 
their arrival for this visit.  
Both glucose and insulin will be injected intravenously into the arm. Blood samples will be 
taken over the course of 3.5 hours, totaling about  15 1/[ADDRESS_477307] is started with an IV glucose bolu s of 0.3g/kg. 
After the glucose bolus, a small dose of human regular  insulin is given IV to moderate the 
plasma glucose rise. The insulin dose is 2 5 mUnits/Kg body weight.  Patients taking oral 
hypoglycemics may be asked to hold those medications the mornin g of the IVGTT but can 
resume taking them following the completion of the IVGTT  the same day .  
 
2.4.10 Self Administered Health Questionnaires  
The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) helps quantify physical function, 
symptoms, social function, self -efficacy and knowledge and quality of life.  The 36 -Item 
Short Form Health Survey (SF -36) measures physical, mental and general health.  T he 
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension – Symptoms and Impact Questionnaire aims to assess 
pulmonary hypertension symptoms and their impact on quality of life.

V14.0  02/14/2022   
 2.5.1 Specimen Handling and Labeling (De-Identification)  
Specimens collected will be properly labeled. All research biological specimens and all 
records associated with the samples will be labeled only with a unique code that contains no 
personal identifiers. The information linking these code numbers to the cor responding 
subject’s identity will be kept in a secure location in the investigator’s office, and will not be 
available to staff managing samples at the research laboratories.  
Immediately upon receipt of the biological specimens, all attempts will be made to process, 
isolate, collect, and store the specimens. The code number and date on which the specimen 
is frozen, all other information about the specimen, and subsequent proces sing will be entered 
on the specimen processing worksheet.  
2.5.[ADDRESS_477308]’s de -identified biological 
samples and data will be stored for future research analyses and may be shared with other 
researchers’, their laboratories or federal repositories. Samples will be sent to the Lai lab at  
Indiana University, Indianapolis for further analysis.  Future sharing outside the institution will 
be done under an approved data or specimen sharing agreement.  
The blood samples will be stored after appropriate coding to remove patient identifiers. The 
coding information linking patient identifiers to the stored samples will be maintained in a 
locked, secure area that will be accessible only to the study investig ator. Subjects may request 
to have their samples destroyed at any time. These samples will be destroyed immediately 
upon receipt of the subjects’ written request to do so. Identification of which samples to destroy 
will be available from the coding informa tion linking patient identifiers to the stored samples 
as described earlier in this paragraph.  
 
2.5.[ADDRESS_477309] Access of Specimens  
Specimens will be kept in the responsible study investigators’ laboratories indefinitely and will 
be under the control of the principal investigator. Investigators or other personnel not involved 
with the management or operations of the study are not permi tted direct access to the 
specimens.  
 
2.6 ENDPOINTS  
 
2.6.1 Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoint of the trial will be mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) during 
submaximal exercise as compared between placebo and nitrite at 1 0 weeks (i .e. the week 
10 RHC of placebo vs week 1 0 RHC of nitrite).  
2.6.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints:  
1.The differences in 6MWT with Borg dyspnea scale assessments and pulse oxygen 
saturation measurements  
2. RHC hemodynamics (right atrial pressure, pulmonary  capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469], 
pulmonary artery pressures and resistance, pulmonary artery compliance, cardiac 
output, diastolic pressure gradients , and transpulmonary gradient)

Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prior to completion if any of the following criteria 
are observed:  
 
• Intercurrent illness or an unexpected fatal or life -threatening adverse event, which 
requires discontinuation of study treatment  
• Pregnancy  
• Subject reached protocol -defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]  
• Request by [CONTACT_247571]  
• Protocol violations  
• Persistent non -compliance  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Investigator discretion  
• Study closed/terminated  
 
2.7.1. Dropouts and withdrawals  
To be considered complete, a subject must complete all study visits as specified in the 
protocol without violations of the protocol so significant as to obscure the response to study 
treatment.  
 
Subjects who fail to complete all study required visits will not be considered complete and 
may not enroll at a later date and will not be replaced. A record will be kept of all subjects who 
fail to complete all study visits and their primary reasons for d iscontinuation.  
 
In the event of subject withdrawal, subjects will be encouraged to continue all follow -up visits 
for safety monitoring or to continue follow up as directed by [CONTACT_380984],  
unless the subject withdraws consent at any time (without having to justify the decision). All 
available data from subjects who discontinued during the study, for whatever reason, will be 
included in the safety analysis.  
 
2.8 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
2.8.1 Sample Size and Power  
Sample size: Prior study has indicated that oral nitrate reduces baseline mean PAP -7 (SD = 
4) mm Hg vs. -3 (4) mmHg in placebo group. A sample size of 12 in each group provides 88%

V14.0  02/14/[ADDRESS_477311] this difference. This sample size will provide 80% power to detect -10 (6) vs. 
-5 (6) decrease in post -exercise mPAP in treatment and placebo group, respectively.  
Statistical analysis: Pre-randomization characteristics of two groups will be presented 
using the median (interquartile range) or frequency tables at each study sequence.  The 
difference of mPAP during submaximal exercise as compared between placebo and nitrite 
at 10 weeks (i.e. the week 1 0 RHC of placebo vs week 1 0 RHC of nitrite) using the 
parametric PK -cross analysis (i.e. an ANOVA which determines the sequence, period, 
carryover, and treatment effects).  Post-exercise values of before and after crossover will be 
compared between two groups using similar approach. For secondary outcomes, we will 
compare the difference of baseline and follow -up value and compare these differences with 
a parametric test. Alternatively a nonparametric test will be used for these comparisons. For 
both primary and secondary outcomes, treatment effect in each sequence as well as mean 
(SD) total treatment effect and corresponding P values will be reported.  
 
We will also test the effect of treatment on pre -exercise mPAP and secondary outcomes using 
mixed effect models. In all analysis , missing data will be imputed and sensitivity analysis with 
imputed data will be performed. All analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_380985].

4.   RECRUITMENT AND INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES  
4.1 RECRUI TMENT METHODS  
 
• A variety of mechanisms will be used to recruit subjects for this protocol.  
 a. UPMC  
Heart failure patients can be referred by [CONTACT_380986]/or cardiologist from the UPMC 
Advanced Heart Failure Center, General Cardiology clinic, Benedum Geriatric Center, the 
Comprehensive Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) Program , internal medicine clinics , or other 
UPMC or community facilit ies. For UPMC Presby[CONTACT_194840]/Montefiore -based clinics, we will 
obtain physician and HRPO approval for screening of subject medical records for 
identification of eligible candidates . He will engage w ith additional cardiologists, internal 
medicine physicians , and geriatricians for permission to screen from those clinics. Once 
identified as preliminarily eligible, the study coordinator/staff will reaffirm with the subject's 
physician on the clinic visit day that recruitment of the subject is medically appropriate. 
Study Short Title:  Oral Nitrite in Patients with PH -HFpEF   Sponsor: Mark T. Gladwin, MD      
PI: M ichael Risbano , MD  
STUDY20010014  
Page 27 of 47 
V14.0  02/14/[ADDRESS_477314]/physician to release needed 
documents to confirm eligibility.  
 
Subjects can also be identified from the inpatient Cardiology service. The study 
coordinator will follow the same procedure as for outpatients by [CONTACT_380987], check medical history for 
heart failure diagnoses , and engag e the attending cardiologist as to appropriateness for 
the study. As noted, permission to speak with subject will be obtained from the Cardiology 
attending.  
 
 b. Research Re gistry  
The HRPO submission will include the request to use the Clinical Translational Science 
Institute’s Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]+Me Research Registry, which includes a database of over 90,[ADDRESS_477315] in participating in research studies. The 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]+Me initiative includes the use of social media to engag e subjects .  We will also request 
to use the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]’s Pepper Center Research Registry which includes a 
database of older individuals interested in research, fostering inclusion of older adults and 
covers individuals in the community, assisted living and skilled nursing facilities.  
 
 c. Advertisements  
An approved study flier and recruitment brochure will be placed in key places and/or be 
distributed to physician offices, related clinics, or on other occasions/venues that present 
as an opportunity to recruit (e.g., a PI [INVESTIGATOR_380952] a community outreach 
event to reach minority subjects). Potential subjects can self -refer by [CONTACT_380988] a telephone number/email address that is provided on these advertisements. 
Study staff will utilize the approved phone screening script when res ponding to interested 
candidates. With subject permission, they will be screened on the phone to make a 
preliminary assessment of eligibility. We will obtain permission to access their medical 
records in the UPMC database or request records from their prov ider as needed to further 
document eligibility.  
 
Advertisement s, such as on radio, television, or print copy in newspapers, or bus signs , 
may also be utilized depending on recruitment rates.  
 
• Once subjects have been determined to be eligible from medical record review and 
attending approval, recruitment and enrollment procedures will then follow, including:  
 
a) Confirmation of eligibility by [CONTACT_70852] .  
 
b) Setting dates for patient visits will also occur prior to screening visit to maintain timeliness 
of visits per protocol.

V14.0  02/14/2022   
 c) Scheduling outpatient screening visit (Visit 1) where study risks and potential benefits and 
rights as a research subject will be described in detail, informed consent will be obtained, 
and final eligibility will be confirmed.  
 
d) To minimize the possibility that subjects will feel obligated to participate, investigators will 
reinforce with their subjects that participation is voluntary, that they do not have to 
participate, and that the decision not to participate will not affect their care, now or in the 
future. The investigator will also allow subjects to make further inquiries if they are 
interested.  
 
4.2 INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES  
 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate 
in the study and continu es throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive 
discussion of risks and possible benefits of participation in this study will be provided to the 
subjects and their families.  Consent forms describing in detail the study procedures and risks 
are given to the subject and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to 
enrolling in the study.  Consent forms will be IRB approved and the subject will be asked to 
read and review the document. Upo n reviewing the document, the investigator will explain the 
research study to the subject and answer any questions that may arise.  The subjects will sign 
the informed consent document prior to being enrolled in the study.  The subjects should have 
the opp ortunity to discuss the study with their surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to 
participate. The subjects may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the 
study. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the subjects for their records. 
The rights and welfare of the subjects will be protected by [CONTACT_380989].  
Prior to performing any of the research study procedures or interventions, subjects must 
provide informed consent. The investigator will verbally explain the study to the potential 
subject in a language understandable to subjects, providing all pertinent i nformation (purpose, 
procedures, risks, benefits, alternatives to participation, etc.), and will allow potential subjects 
ample opportunity to ask questions to elicit a better understanding of the study. Following this 
verbal explanation, potential subject s will be provided with a local IRB approved consent form 
and will be asked to read and review the document. Upon reviewing the document, the 
investigator will provide adequate opportunity for the subject to consider all options,  and 
answer any additional questions the potential subject may have. Every effort will be made to 
ensure that subjects have comprehended the study information prior to obtaining subject's 
voluntary agreement to participate.  
Remote Consent ing 
Remote consent ing may be used as opposed to in person consenting where possible to 
reduce unnecessary in person encounters . In the event remote consent ing is utilized, subjects  
will be provided with a copy of the informed consent prior to the teleconsent meeting either 
via email, fax, mail or previously provided during an in person visit.  After the physician 
investigator  and subject  review the consent form  via video conferencing (e.g., telephone, 
conference call, videoconference, telemedicine, etc.) , the subject  will be  offered the 
opportunity to ask any questions and have those questions answered.  The subject  will sign 
and date the informed consent.

consent form or agreed to participate electronically.  The signed document is then mailed, 
emailed, photo/scanned to text or faxed to the study team . 
If the signed consent is provided as an electronic copy (emailed,  photo/scanned, or faxed), 
the subject will  return the original signed document on their first in person visit or by [CONTACT_2319].  If 
the signed consent form is mailed to the study team, the physician investigator  will sign their 
copy which they possess after the subject  has acknowledged signature [CONTACT_381008]. Once 
the subject’s  original copy is received  the study team’s  copy will be attached to make a single 
document.  
The study team will document the remote consent process, including the date and time the 
conversation occurred, how it occurred (e.g., telephone, video conference), the name s of the 
participants, confirmation that the subject received the informed consent, and confirmation of 
verbal informed consent to participate . 
In addition, older potential participants whose competency to consent is in question will be 
tested for sufficient comprehension and recall of the information presented. Prospective 
subjects who do not remember the important facts about participation in th e research study 
after repeated testing will not be included in the study.  
The subjects may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the study. A copy of 
the informed consent document will be given to the subjects for their records. The rights and 
welfare of the subjects will be protected by [CONTACT_21223].  
5.   POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
5.1. Risk of Experimental Drug Intervention  
 
Numerous studies have evaluated acute, subacute , and chronic drinking water exposures of 
nitrite in laboratory animals , and drinking water and dietary exposures in humans. Recent 
studies are available using a high dose of nitrite by [CONTACT_380990]. 
Recent studies have evaluated acute exposures of oral preparations of nitrite on PK and blood 
press ure and are characterized below. More extensive human data is available on parenteral 
sodium nitrite as it is currently available and approved by [CONTACT_380991] . [72, 73]  It is also notable that neutrapharmaceutical 
preparations are currently being sold with levels of nitrite (12.7 mg per tablet).  
   
Nitrite:  
Sodium nitrite has been used commercially as a food preservative, an anti -corrosive agent, a 
coloring agent, and an anti -anginal agent, with additional uses in laxatives, burn ointments, 
and liniments. Amyl nitrite has been inhaled or ingested as an euphor ic stimulant.  Nitrite has 
also been found as a contaminant in well water. Literature searches generated case reports 
of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, flushing, cyanosis, tachypnea, 
dyspnea, hypotension , and death attributed to exc ess nitrite (high -dose) exposure from these 
sources as a consequence of methemoglobinemia due to oxidation of heme -iron in 
oxyhemoglobin. Normal background methemoglobin production is 1 -3%. If levels of 
methemoglobin rise above approximately 30% of total h emoglobin, a subject may appear 
cyanotic and experience dyspnea, due to the reduced oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin 
Study Short Title:  Oral Nitrite in Patients with PH -HFpEF   Sponsor: Mark T. Gladwin, MD      
PI: M ichael Risbano , MD  
STUDY20010014

V14.0  02/14/2022   
 (methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen). Levels above 50% can cause seizures, hypotension, 
coma , and death. Sodium nitrite administration for cyanide poisoning at the labeled dosage of 
[ADDRESS_477317] never risen higher than 3% at the 
currently used therapeutic doses (< 75 mg) in [ADDRESS_477318]. Gladwin, has previously held an IND for sodium nitrite 
(IND # 70,411) for cardiovascular applications and currently has an approved IND for the use 
of sodium nitrite for lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (IND # 111,643). The cardiovascular IND 
involved the administration of sodium nitrite to 69 normal volunteers in 4 phase I-II clinical 
trials without observed adverse effects. He has also treated 11 subjects with sickle cell 
disease on this IND without observed adverse effects. The lower doses of nitrite used in these 
investigational treatment regimens – 60-120 mg daily or 2 0-40% of the dose (300mg) used in 
the emergency treatment of cyanide poisoning – do not produce methemoglobin levels greater 
than 3% and have not been associated with clinically significant hypotension. There have 
been no adverse events noted in the 80 tre ated normal human volunteers and patients with 
sickle cell disease33-35. In another study by [CONTACT_380992]., 18 healthy adults received an 
infusion of sodium nitrite  totaling 75 mg (15 minutes each x 2 infusions). This was associated 
with a 7 mmHg decrease in mean arterial pressure, a peak methemoglobin of less 3% , and 
no other significant effects34. Note this single dose is 1.[ADDRESS_477319] crossover study, 9 healthy adult subjects received two single high 
dose oral sodium nitrite aqueous solutions  (0.12 and 0.06 mmol NaNo 2/mmol Hb, equivalent 
to 290 -380 mg and 140 -190 mg sodium nitrite, respectively, depending on the total body 
hemoglobin level of the person) and one intravenous sodium nitrite  dose (0.12 mmol 
NaNo 2/mmol Hb)18. Note that this is 1.[ADDRESS_477320] 7 days between each of th e treatments. Mild headache 
occurred in 44 -55% of subjects and was the most frequent complaint during each treatment 
session, which the authors ascribed to the sodium nitrite, not methemoglobinemia, as the 
percentage of methemoglobinemia stayed below clini cally toxic levels (<15%). By [CONTACT_377972], up 
to 22% experienced nausea, which subsided within half an hour18. The pharmacokinetic 
analysis of this study indicated similar bioavailability of oral and IV delivery of nitrite, as well 
as similar side effect and sa fety profiles.  
 
A recent study determined the safety and feasibility of prolonged intravenous nitrite infusion . 
Twelve adult volunteers received increasing starting doses of sodium nitrite, 4.2 to 533.8 
μg/kg/hr for 48 hours. Dose limiting toxicity occurred at 445.7 μg/kg/hr (10.6 mg/kg/day) and 
was limited to asymptomatic transient decreases of arterial blood pre ssure of up to 20 mmHg 
and asymptomatic increases of methemoglobin levels above 5%. No tolerance or clinically 
significant rebound was observed36. Note, this is 8 .2 times the daily dose we plan to use in 
this trial (based on an adult body weight of 95 kg).  
 
For nitrite, two retrospective case -control studies have shown that high maternal dietary nitrite 
intake from cured meat or drinking water during pregnancy might be associated with risk of 
childhood brain tumors and possibly gastric and esophageal cancer. This evidence is only 
based on retrospective case -control studies; cohort studies have found no significantly 
increased risks24. 
 
In the 2001 National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report summarizing 2 -year rodent drinking 
water studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity  of sodium nitrite in male or 
Study Short Title:  Oral Nitrite in Patients with PH -HFpEF   Sponsor: Mark T. Gladwin, MD

 female F344/N rats exposed to up to 130 mg/kg/day in males and 150 mg/kg/day in females, 
or in male B6C3F1 mice exposed to up to 220 mg/kg/day. There was equivocal evidence of 
carcinogenic  activity of sodium nitrite in the highest dose of 165 mg/kg/day in female B6C3F1 
mice based on the positive trend in the incidences of squamous cell papi[INVESTIGATOR_380953] 
(combined) of the forestomach. Exposure to sodium nitrite in drinking water resulted in 
incre ased incidences of epi[INVESTIGATOR_380954]. However, no chromosomal 
damage (genetic toxicity) was observed in three studies conducted in rats and mice in vivo37. 
Taken together, these findings suggest minimal carcinogenic nitrite -mediated risk.  
 
In the current study, we will use lower doses of nitrite than used safely in any of these studies. 
Our nitrite dose of 40 mg three times daily is lower than the dose used on the cardiovascular 
IND and <  40% of the dose for cyanide poisoning.  
 
To summarize, we anticipate the following symptoms by [CONTACT_380993]:

Risks of Accelerometer Use  
Common risks associated with wearing the accelerometer are redness, irritation, and chaffing.  
 
Risks of Right heart Catheterization  
Common risks:  pain at the needle entry site and slight risk of bleeding around the site , bruising 
at site , lightheadedness or dizziness during the needle stick.  
Infrequent risks: puncturing the lung which would require a chest tube insertion, irregular 
heartbeats which usually stop when the long tube is removed from the heart.  
Very rare complications include cardiac arrhythmias , cardiac tamponade , low blood 
pressure, infection, or embolism  caused by [CONTACT_380994].  
 
Risks of the Use of Micromanometer Catheter during Catheterization  
The micromanometer pressure and flow catheter s are FDA approved, and have been used 
for clinical/investigative indications for over [ADDRESS_477323] 5+ years. Risks  associated with this procedure are 
estimated to be rare, which include abnormal heart rhythm, bleeding, or perforation of the 
heart or pulmonary artery.  
Risks of Medications used during Catheterization  
The medications used for sedation are relatively brief in duration and should wear off within 
several hours. The side effects are listed below for each drug.  
• 1% Lidocaine:  will be used to numb the area prior to the insertion of the cardiac catheter 
into either the arm, neck or groin vein. A common side effect is slight burning at the site 
which dissipates quickly.   
• Fentanyl : Common side effects include temporary light -headedness, dizziness, and 
nausea, vomiting or sweating.  
• Midazolam : Common side effect includes  drowsiness. Infrequent side effects are nausea, 
vomiting. Breathing problems are rare.  Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, itching, etc.) to 
lidocaine, fentanyl, or midazolam are rare.  
 
Risks of Fluoroscopy  during the Catheterization  
An x-ray may be done, if indicated, on participants whose neck vein is used for the 
catheterization. An X-ray performed for the purpose of this research study involves exposure 
to radiation. Each x-ray will result in a radiation dose of approximately 3 rem s to the neck  with 
minimal exposure of other body areas. A total of 9 rems if all three RHC’s are performed. For 
comparison, radiation workers are permitted, by [CONTACT_380995], to receive a maximum 
annual radiation dose of [ADDRESS_477324] sensitive organs of their body. There is no 
minimum amount of radiation exposure that is recognized as being tota lly free of the risk of 
causing genetic mutations (abnormal cells) or cancer. However, the risk associated with the

V14.0  02/14/[ADDRESS_477325] (CPET ) 
CPET is a well -established clinical tool. The risk of serious or fatal complications is rare. The 
risks include but are not limited to the following:  
• Common risks include shortness of breath, mild angina, musculoskeletal discomfort.  
• Infrequent risk includes hypotension , chest pain.  
• Rarely, exercise may cause moderate to extreme pain which could be due to muscle 
sprains, muscle strains, broken bones, or chest pain, changes include shortness of breath, 
abnormal blood pressure, or fainting, myocardial infarction, prolonged cardiac arrhythmia, 
stroke, or sudden death are rare (occur in <1% of people).  
 
Risk of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_380955]. Albuterol will 
be available if this occurs. Rarely, a subject may have coughing or lightheadedness with 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]. If Albuterol is given, the subject will get up to [ADDRESS_477326]  (IVGTT)  
• IV Catheter Insertion Common Risks: bruising, soreness, phlebitis . Infrequent Risks: 
infiltration (a leakage of anything that has been given through the vein (such as the 
saline, dextrose, deuterated glucose, insulin) into the arm tissue that surrounds the vein 
and holds the IV). Other Risks: infection, dizziness/faintin g, bleeding . 
 
• IVGTT Common Risks: (occurring in less than 25% of people) include: phlebitis 
(inflammation of a vein), transient hyperglycemia (high blood sugar not requiring 
treatment).  Rare side effects (occurring in less than 1%  of people) include: 
Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) which may  cause symptoms such as shakiness, 
nervousness, sweatiness, hunger, dizziness , or fast heart rate. If severe, hypoglycemia 
can cause coma, seizure, or even death . 
 
Reproductive Risks    
It is not known if the study drug can affect an unborn baby. Therefore, subjects should not 
become pregnant or father a baby [CONTACT_56035].  If subjects are physically able to father 
a baby, subjects must use an effective method of birth control whil e on this study. If subjects 
become aware that they or their sexual partner is pregnant during the course of their 
participation in this research study, subjects must contact, as soon as possible, the study 
investigator.  
Risk of Collection and Storage of Private Health Information and Internet Usage  
Although we are taking many steps to protect the participants' information, there is always a 
chance that their information or identity could be disclosed. We will continue to review and 
improve the ways we keep their information private. To protect their information, paper -based 
records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel involved in the 
study. Paper charts will c ontain subject identifiers but will be in locked cabinets within a locked 
office on a unit that has restricted access.

In addition, the DSMB Report address ing the following information will be submitted to the 
IRB at the time of continuing review , annually or more often as required:  
 
• A list of the research personnel who participated in the data and safety monitoring.  
• The frequency of monitoring that took place during the renewal intervals and/or the dates 
that data and safety monitoring was conducted.  
• A summary of cumulative data related to unanticipated problems (including adverse 
events) including a determination of causality and whether the risk to benefit assessment 
has changed.  
• If appropriate, a summary of pertinent scientific literature reports, therapeutic 
developments, or results of related studies that may have an impact on the safety of 
study participants or the ethics of the research study.  
• A summary of the outcome of reviews conducted to ensure subject privacy and research 
data confidentiality.  
• Final conclusions regarding changes to the anticipated benefit -to-risk assessment of the

Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_380956], we propose to temporarily suspend enroll ment  and review with our DSMB 
if any two subject s experience  the following  despi[INVESTIGATOR_16574] :  
 
1. A single occurrence of venous methemoglobin level >5%  
If subjects report change in skin tone and dizziness or other signs of methemoglobinemia 
for >24 hours, an interim visit will be scheduled (if not already being seen for a research 
visit) and the following steps will occur. The visit can be conducted in UPMC Presby[CONTACT_380998].  
The physician investigator will factor relevant subject symptoms and hemodynamics and:  
• Determine if unblinding is needed (if methemoglobin % >5) and,  
• If subject is willing to do an interim visit with repeat drug dosing of 20 mg with follow 
up methemoglobin and BP pressure monitoring or  
• Subject should be withdrawn

 methemoglobin testing after 3 days.   If level persists above 5% on lower dose, 
participation in the study for the subject  will be discontinued.  
2. Blood pressure  (BP) and related symptoms : If subjects experience lightheadedness or 
dizziness, we request that they call the study  coordinator who will assess their 
symptoms, compare to baseline levels, and discuss need for interim visit with study 
physician.  If a visit is indicated, BP , RR, heart rate,  pulse co -oximetry and 
methe moglobin level via co -oximetry  will be measured.   
• If systolic BP ≤  90mm Hg, the study drug  will be  reduced from 40 TID to 20 TID .  
Subjects will be reassessed via telephone to ensure that the patient is stable on 
the new dose. If stable  and asymptomatic , subjects will continue with the half dose.

If an unexpected fatal event or any of the above life -threatening events occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_54061], the study will be halted, until data review by [CONTACT_380999] a final recommendation about study 
continu ation . 
Other potential reasons for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_380958]  
1. Subject participation will be discontinued if a participant has a positive pregnancy test 
at any point during study participation.  
2. In the event that the medication compliance rate is <  80%, subjects will be re -
educated on medication compliance. If medication compliance falls outside of the 
acceptable range  more than [ADDRESS_477333] 
eligibility for continued participation in the study.  
 
5.5.3 Parameters to be Monitored  
The following progress will be monitored throughout the course of the research to ensure the 
safety of subjects as well as the integrity and confidentiality of their data.  
 
• An evaluation of the progress of the research study, including subject recruitment 
and retention, and an assessment of the timeliness and quality of the data.  
 
• A review of collected data (including adverse events, unanticipated problems, and 
subject withdrawals) to determine whether there is a change to the anticipated 
benefit -to-risk assessment of study participation and whether the study should 
continue as originally desig ned, should be changed, or should be terminated.  
 
• An assessment of external factors or relevant information (eg. pertinent scientific 
literature reports or therapeutic development, results of related studies) that may 
have an impact on the safety and study participants or the ethics of the research 
study.

5.[ADDRESS_477336] Risks  
General Risks of Study Protocol and Procedures  
All research interventions/activities will be conducted in private patient care areas. The 
collection of sensitive information about subjects is limited to the amount necessary to achieve 
the aims of the research, so that no unneeded sensitive information is being collected.  
 
All demographic and clinical information about the subject will be stored on an electronic 
password -guarded study database under the supervision of the Investigator for this protocol. 
The electronic database that is being used for the purpose of this study  has not been fully 
validated to be in compliance with the FDA regulations at 21 CFR Part 11; i.e. taking into 
account the limited scope of this clinical investigation. The data will be stripped of individual 
identifiers and stored anonymously with a subje ct number. Information linking subject 
identifiers with the coded subject number will be stored under password protection on 
computers in locked areas, with access only to the database manager. Maintaining records in 
locked files in locked offices will pro tect confidentiality of subjects. All staff will sign 
confidentiality statements. Access to the database will be limited to the data manager and 
staff under the supervision of the Investigator.  
 
Specimens will be stripped of subject identifiers and stored according to a similar coding 
protocol as described above. These specimens will be stored safely in the custody of the 
Investigator responsible for the individual assays. The Investigators will l imit future access to 
any remaining sample to only those investigators with prior IRB approval for their studies.  
 
All staff involved in this study are properly credentialed and instructed in the areas of testing, 
confidentiality, and safety.  
 
The Investigator will retain the data for the entire period of this study. The Investigator may 
continue to use and disclose subjects’ de -identified information for the purpose of this study 
for a minimum of seven years after final reporting or publication  of the study. If the subject

The EvK Trial (STU#022015 -023),  Copyright 2015-[ADDRESS_1128863] the patient’s life.  Usually 
the treating medical team administers a drug to sedate the patient before the breathing tube is 
placed. For critically ill patients it is common to choose either etomidate or ketamine to sedate 
the patient . These drugs are often chosen because they have few effects on the patient’s blood 
pressure and heart rate. Etomidate h as some  other  serious side effects which include interference 
with the production of steroids by [CONTACT_234127]. Previous studies have suggested that 
etomidate may  cause greater long -term illness and even death because of this side effect . The 
purpose of the EvK T rial is to evaluate which drug (etomidate or ketamine) is better for patients 
who are critically ill. We believe that ketamine is associated with improved chance of survival 
after emergency endotracheal intubation because it does not interfere with steroid production. Because this study involves research of an emergency medical procedure, we have created a 
comprehensive Community Consultation Plan and Post-E nrollment Notification P lan that meets 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations for emergency research. 
2. Introduction and Purpose:  
Patients who are critically ill may  require emergency placement of an endotracheal tube. 
The purpose of the endotracheal tube is to save and sustain the patient’s life. Prior to placement 
of an endotracheal tube, it is common for the supervising medical team to administer a drug intravenously to sedate the patient to make this placement of the tube tolerable . Several drugs are 
commonly  used for this purpose , including etomidate, ketamine and propofol. Both etomidate 
and ketamine are useful in critical ly ill patients  because they offer relative hemodynamic 
stability compared to propofol.  Ketamine has few, if any, serious long- term side effects.

The EvK Trial (STU#022015 -023),  Copyright 2015-[ADDRESS_1128864] patients at risk 
for adrenal insufficiency or death (Coursin  et al., 2013). A recent Cochrane Collaboration 
Review concluded that etomidate is associated with increased risk of adrenal dysfunction and 
multi-organ dysfunction in critically ill patients (Bruder et al., 2015). There is ongoing controversy regarding th e routine use of etomidate  in critically ill patients .  
The purpose  of the EvK Trial is to compare and contrast the safety of etomidate with 
ketamine in the setting of emergency endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients. In this study we will randomize patients to receive either etomidate or ketamine. Our  hypothesis  is that 
ketamine is associated with increased chance of survival in critically ill patients. The proposed mechanism  of this effect is that ketamine does not affect the adrenal axis. The  specific 
aim of the study is to conduct an adequately powered trial suitable to compare etomidate and 
ketamine in terms of proportions survived at 7-days post-intubation.  The  primary endpoint  is 
survival at 7 days after intubation. Secondary endpoints  include long- term survival (28 -day), 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, anesthetic complications, intubating conditions, duration of ventilator support, duration of catecholamine therapy, neurological scores, measures of ICU outcomes, measures of long -term functional status, changes in blood 
pressure, new diagnoses, and others. Appendix 1 lists primary and secondary endpoints for the study.
 
3. Detailed Background, Evaluation of Prior Research and Internal QA/QI Data : 
Both etomidate and ketamine are standard -of-care for emergency endotracheal intubation, 
and both are frequently used locally, nationally and internationally. Etomidate is often used at our institution (Parkland Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), based on our last QA/QI survey of our practices 
(Figure s 1 and 2). There is considerable controversy regarding the long- term safety of the use of 
CONFIDENTIAL  – NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 
The EvK Trial (STU#022015 -023),  Copyright 2015-[ADDRESS_1128865] study to date that evaluated this 
question ( the KETASE D Trial, Jabre et al., 2009) randomized patients requiring emergency 
endotracheal intubation to either etomidate (n=23 4) or ketamine (n=235). The patients who 
received etomidate experienced a much -higher frequency of adrenal dysfunction, and a slight but 
not statistically significant increase in multi-organ dysfunction and morta lity. Other published 
reports echo concerns about etomidate. A sub -group analysis within the CORTICUS Trial 
(Sprung et al., 2008) (n=99 receiving etomidate, n=403 receiving other agents) found that one dose of etomidate was associated with evidence of adrenal insufficiency and increased mortality (Cuthbertson et al., 2009). Another sub- group analysis from a different clinical trial (Arabi et al., 
2010) of cirrhotic patients with septic shock (n=23 receiving etomidate, n=39 receiving other agents) reported increased ICU mortality associated with a single dose of etomidate (Cherfan et al., 2011). A recent meta -analysis incorporating these and other studies concluded that a single 
dose of etomidate is associated with adrenal insufficiency and increased mortality (Chan et al., 
2012).  
In late 2014 and early 2015 the Department of Anesthesiology at Parkland Memorial 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815308] a Quality Assessment/Quality Improvement (QA/QI) project that evaluated  
techniques and outcomes from emergency endotracheal intubations done by [CONTACT_815344] (ACT) . The ACT  is responsible for providing emergency endotracheal intubations in many 
locations of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], including the intensive care units, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_173967], and elsewhere. Over 
the last year, the ACT  has performed on average 34 intubations per month (Figure 1). Etomidate 
is frequently utilized for emergency endotracheal intubation by [CONTACT_106528], Figure 2. Patient 
outcomes are shown in Figure 3. Of note , survival seems worse in patients who have received 
etomidate (Figure 3), even when severity of illness is considered using Sequential Organ Failure

Page 6 of 68 Assessment (SOFA) scores (Figure 4). In Figure 4, the calculated SOFA scores in that patients 
receiving etomidate were relatively similar to those re ceiving propofol (Figure 4), and yet the 
survival seems much worse (Figure 3).  Patients receiving no sedative medication had the highest 
SOFA scores (as expected), suggesting a low predicted survival rate.  High SOFA scores 
correspond to high predicted mortality. 
The purpose of the EvK Trial is to be the largest trial to date that randomizes critically ill 
patients to etomidate (n=375 patients) versus ketamine (n=375). Additionally, the EvK Trial has 
been designed to address some of the shortcomings of the KETASED trial. First, t he KETASED 
trial was not powered to detect a diffe rence in mortality , although did find a trend in survival 
benefit in those patients randomized to receive ketamine . We have designed the EvK Trial to be 
powered to detect a 10% difference in survival in our patient population ( See Section  14 for a 
discussion of our statistical approach ). Second, the primary endpoint of the KETASED trial was 
the maximum SOFA score in the first 72 hours as the primary endpoint. From our QA/QI data, 
we believe that a more ap propriate  endpoint in our patient population  is survival at Day 7. Third, 
the KETASED trial enrolled a large percentage of patients (approximately 70% in each group) 
who were intubated for “neurological” reasons, and relatively few patients (approximately 10% in each group) who were intubated for shock or sepsis. Prior work has suggested that patients with sepsis and shock are much more vulnerable to the side effects of etomidate. In our QA/QI data, approximately 50% of the patients intubated by [CONTACT_815345], and at least 25% 
have sepsi s. This suggests that our patient population is more likely to benefit from use of 
ketamine compared to the patient population in KETASED.  4. Concise Summary of Project:

Page 7 of 68  The EvK Trial is a prospective randomized clinical trial that  will be done at Parkland 
Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Individual patients requiring emergency endotracheal intubation will be 
randomized to receive either etomidate  (n=375 patients) or ketamine  (n=375 patients) . The trial 
will be  conducted by [CONTACT_815346] t eam and colleagues in the Department s of 
Anesthesiology, Emerge ncy Medicine, Internal Medicine,  Critical Care Medicine , and Surgery, 
in close collaboration with the Department of Pharmacy. The study will be done exclusively at Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. A provisio nal list of collaborators and co-investigators is listed on Page 1 of 
this protocol, and provisional  liaison assignments are listed in Appendix 2. The liaisons will help 
orient their colleagues to the study and study procedures.  Figure 5 shows a block dia gram of the flow of patients through the study. Eligible 
patients will be identified by [CONTACT_3433] e participating medical teams (a nesthesia team, emergency 
department, c ritical c are medicine, surgery).  Patients will be  screened and  enrolled by [CONTACT_392729]: 
The Anesthesia Code Team  (ACT)  and/or the Emergency Department  (ED) . Pre-randomized  
envelopes will be included in the emergency airway medication  boxes used by [CONTACT_815347] D epartment.  Alternatively, t hese pre -randomized envelopes will 
be immediately available to the aforementioned teams. These envelopes will have inclusion and exclusion criteria printed on the outside. Immediately before administering a sedative medication , the randomization envelope w ill be opened, and this will determine which drug a 
patient receives (either etomidate , n=375 patients, or ketamine , n=375 patients). Standard doses 
of these drugs will be recommended to the treating medical teams (etomidate 0.2 -0.3 mg per kg 
intravenous , ketamine 1 -2 mg per kg intravenous). Other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including vasopressors, 
paralytic agents and other adjunctive agents will be at the discretion of the treating medical and surgical teams.  Following randomization, study data will be gathered remotely through the EPIC

patients in th e Emergency Department (ED), the ED team will screen, randomize and enroll the 
patient. For patients elsewhere in Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the Anesthesia Code Team (ACT) will screen, randomize and enroll the patient. The ACT and ED teams will have access to the study randomization envelopes and drug boxes. The drug boxes are already in use by [CONTACT_815348]. Randomizing a patient in the study will involve opening a pre- printed envelope that will 
be included with the emergency medication boxes , or will be immediately available to the ACT 
or ED teams . The envelopes will have printed inclusion criteria (Section 7) and exclusion criteria 
(Section 8) on the outside to facilitate rapid and accurate screening of patients. The envelopes will contain a card that indicates which drug the patient should receive for sedation (etomidate or ketamine). Recommended doses of these medications will be printed as well (etomidate 0.2 -0.3 
mg / kg intravenous, ketamine 1-2 mg / kg intravenous). All other medical and surgical manag ement will be at the discretion of the treating team.  
 Following randomization the ACT or ED team will notify the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_815309] / pager call regarding enrollment of the patient.  The study 
team will conduct the remainder of the study retrospectively by [CONTACT_815349]. The 
study will have no i mpact on the patient’s medical or surgical management, or subsequent care,

11. Potential Risks:  
 The principal medical risks of this study relate to the side effect profiles of ketamine and etomidate.  Both etomidate and ketamine are standard -of-care medications for emergency 
endotracheal intubation (Jabre et al., 2009). Each drug does have the potential for side effects, which include the effects listed below.  
Common a dverse reaction s to e tomidate  
A) Transient venous pain on injection  
B) Transient skeletal movements  
C) Hypoventilation 
D) Hypertension (uncommon) or hypotension (uncommon). Significant changes in blood pressure are relatively uncommon with etomidate.  
E) Nausea and/or vomiting 
F) Suppression of adrenal function 
Common Adverse reactions to Ketamine  
A) Hallucinations, delirium  
B) Hypertension (more common , tends to be relatively minor changes) or hypotension (rare)  
C) Hypoventilation 
D) Tachycardia  (usually minor) 
E) Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements)

 Study oversight will include a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB will include specialists from several different specialties including anesthesiology, critical care medicine, surgery and pharmacy (Appendix 2) . The DSMB will meet quarterly or monthly as 
needed  to review all patient enrollments. If necessary the DSMB will meet more often than that 
to review specific study subjects. All study subjects will be reviewed by [CONTACT_815353]- related adverse outcomes. A written record of DSMB meetings will be generated . The IRB 
will be notified in writing of any adverse study -related outcomes, using the existing IRB 
reporting forms.   13. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality:  
Study data will be collected and stored at Parkla nd Memorial Hospit al. [CONTACT_815374]’s 
office in the Department of Anesthesiology will serve as the central node of the study. Her office is locked, and a locked storage cabinet will be used to store study- related materials. Her office is 
New Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Rm# H3119. 
While the study is ongoing, electronic study data will be stored on a password-protected 
laptop computer, and on a password- protected flash drive(s). Study data itself will be maintained 
on a Microsoft spreadsheet f ile(s) that are maintained on secured computer devices, and on 
handwritten worksheets . The spreadsheet itself will include the study subject’s medical record 
number and birthdate, along with other data relevant to the primary and secondary study endpoints. The study worksheets will include a patient demographic sticker.  Appendix 3 contains 
CONFIDENTIAL  – NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 
The EvK Trial (STU#022015 -023),  Copyright 2015-[ADDRESS_1128871] will be given a study number, for example Subject001. Prior to public disclosure of data (for example 
publication of study results), all protected health information including medical record number and birthdate will be removed. For the sake of posterity, a confidential file will be maintained 
that links sub ject number to medical record number. This information will not be disclosed 
publicly. Study data will also be stored on a secured RedCap Database, a sample of which appears in Appendix 3.  
Paper records that are generated duri ng the study will include individual study subject 
worksheets (Appendix 4) which we will retain in secure storage, and also formal notification letters that will be placed in the medical record and/or mailed to enrolled patients and/or their families or ne xt of kin (Appendix 13 and 14). Other paper documentation will include records of 
DSMB meetings. P aper records will be stored temporarily in Pam Fox’s  office in the locked 
storage cabinet.  
Long- term storage of study data and forms will be in the Departmen t of Anesthesiology 
storage locker. This locker is located in the Bass Buil ding, Lower Level, Storage Unit #53. The 
locker is climate controlled. The physical address is [ADDRESS_1128872], Dallas, TX . The key 
to the storage locker is maintained in the lock box in the Chairperson’s Office Suite. This locker is used for long- term storage of clinic records, confidential files and other sensitive documents. 
We have used this storage locker for long- term storage of other research documents (with IRB 
approval). Once the mandatory storage time has elapsed (historically 6 years), study records will be destroyed.

be disclosed. We will also publish our methodology, including the methodology used for emergency research (Appendix 5). There will likely be several publications that arise from this research project.  
14. Potential Benefits:  
 The purpose of this study is to define which agent, etomidate or ketamine, is associated with a greater chance of survival after emergency endotracheal intubation. We believe that the increase in the usage of ketam ine that will happen as a result of this study is likely to benefit the 
patients at Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815313] . In our recent QA/ QI project of emergency endotracheal 
intubations done by [CONTACT_815354] (ACT) we found that etomidate is commonly used for sedation during this procedure. Propofol is also relatively commonly used by [CONTACT_106528]. However, in our review of cases we found that etomidate seems to be associated with lower long- term su rvival compared to other agents (Figure 3).  In our QA/QI project we also observed 
that p ropofol is associated with the phenomenon of immediate post- administration cardiac arrest, 
more than any other sedative agent. Thus, we believe that increase in usage of ketamine that will 
happen as a result of this study is likely to benefit the patient s at Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815313] . 
There are many  other potential benefits to patients outside the study, and to society in general. 
Presently etomidate is frequently used for emergency intubation, locally, nationally and

etomidate should be restricted .  
15. Biostatistics:  
The study is designed and powered to have 80% power with 0.[ADDRESS_1128875] a 10% difference in proportions survived at 7-days post endotracheal intubation.  Based on the 
data from our QA/QI project, the proportions of patients survived are assumed to be 85% and 95% 
for the etomidate and ketamine groups, respectively. With these assumptions, n = 750 patients (etomidate n=375, ketamine n=375) will be needed to have 80% power. Assuming a 10% screen failures (individuals who were randomized, but then never intubated for clinical reasons), we anticipate n = 825 will be needed.
 
Study subjects will be ana lyzed in an “intent to treat” manner regardless of what agent(s) 
they receive, as long as they receive an induction agent and are intubated. The primary hypothesis of no – difference in proportions survived at [ADDRESS_1128876] 
for proportions. Results for the primary study aim will be summarized as p-value and 95% confidence interval for difference in proporti ons survived. Chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact test, 
Student’s t-test and log-rank test will be used to test hypotheses related to secondary end-points. All 
analyses will be done with a 0.05 level of significance.
 
Using data from a recent QA/QI project, we estimate that the Anesthesia Code Team 
performs approximately [ADDRESS_1128877]. Pease , our collaborator in the Emergency Department, has estimated that the emergency 
department performs approximately 10-20 emergency endotracheal intubations per month, or approximately 120 per year. In the operating rooms and related procedural areas, we estimate that the department of anesthesia performs approximately 10-20 emergency endotracheal intubations per month, or approximately 120 per year. These number combined could provide approximately 640

Executive Summary  
The EvK  Trial will be conducted at Parkland Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815319], Emergency Medicine, Medicine / Critical Care Medicine, 
Surgery, Pharmacy and Clinical Science. The study will randomize critically ill patients wh o 
require emergency endotracheal intubation to one of two groups: Etomidate or Ketamine. Because of the nature of this study – an emergency procedure on a critically ill patient – the study will require formal permission to by[CONTACT_815356]- enrollment written in formed consent. The 
purpose of this Community Consultation Plan is to fulfill the community consultation requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations Section 50.24 ( hereafter “FDA 21 CFR 50.24”), which governs research in emergency medical 
conditions. The Community Consultation Plan outlined in this document fulfills FDA 21 CFR 50.24 by [CONTACT_658456] a plan to notify community leaders and the public at- large about this research 
study, provisions for study opt-out, and provisions for notification of study enrollment. This plan 
is based on FDA 21 CFR 50.24, and published expert recommendation (Holsti et al., 2015; Salzman et al., 2007). 
Background and Rationale for a Community Consultation Plan 
The EvK Trial is a stu dy of the medications given to patients who require emergency 
endotracheal intubation. Study subjects will be randomized to receive one of two drugs immediately prior to emergency endotracheal intubation: etomidate or ketamine. Both etomidate and ketamine are currently standard -of-care for this procedure. Each drug has unique side 
effects. The EvK Trial will test the hypothesis that ketamine is associated with higher rates of survival after emergency endotracheal intubation. The proposed mechanism of this e ffect is that 
ketamine does not affect the adrenal glands, and therefore is safer for patients requiring

The EvK Trial (STU#022015 -023),  Copyright 2015-[ADDRESS_1128885] his/her questions answered. Written informed consent is a standard part of non -emergency research that involve s human 
subjects.  The requirement for pre -enrollment written informed consent is problematic for 
research studies that involve emergency medical care (Holsti et al., 2015; Salzman et al., 2007). In emergency situations it may be impractical or impossible to obtain proper written informed consent pr ior to treatment intervention(s). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
published guidelines for research that involves emergency medical care (FDA 21 CFR 50.24).The FDA has determined that pre- enrollment written informed consent may be waived  for 
studies of emergency medical care, provided the stipulations outlined in FDA 21 CFR 50.24 are met. The EvK Trial qualifies to be conducted without pre-enrollment consent outlined in FDA 21 CFR 50.24 because it meets the following requirements: 
I. The human subjects are in a life -threatening situation that necessitates urgent 
intervention.  
II. Available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory . 
III. Collection of valid scientific evidence is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of the intervention. 
IV. Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because the subjects are not able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition.

VI. There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively individuals likely to become eligible for participation.  
VII. Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects.  
VIII. The clinical investigation could not practically be carried out without the waiver.

I. Consultation (including, where appropriate, consultation carried out by [CONTACT_1201]) with  representatives of the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn.  
II. Public disclosure to the communities in which the clinical investigation will be 
conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn, prior to initiation of the clinical investigation, of plans for the investigation and its risks and expected benefits.  
III. Public disclosure of sufficient informat ion following completion of the clinical 
investigation to apprise the community and researchers of the study, including the demographic characteristics of the  research population, and its results. 
IV. Establishment of an independent data monitoring committee to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation.  
V. If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized representative is not reasonably available, the investigator has committed, if feasible, to attempting to contact [CONTACT_815357]'s family member who is not a 
legally authorized representative, and asking whether he or she objects to the subject's

The EvK Trial (STU#022015 -023),  Copyright 2015-[ADDRESS_1128888] was formulated based on local and regional governmental structure, and guided by 2010 census data detailing demographic information for the Dallas -Fort Worth area and published expert recommendations 
(Holsti et al., 2015; Salzman et al., 2007). Community outreach will be conducted bilingually (English and Spanish), reflecting the two most commonly used languages in Dallas- Fort Worth 
and in Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Appendix 9 shows a draft letter Outreach to Community Leaders.

will be invited to the initial outreach meeting.  We plan to invite more than 300 individuals and 
organizations to the community meetings. This number compares favorably to prior reports of 
community notification plans, for example Salzman et al., 2007. In Salzman et al., 2007, a total of 127 individuals and organizations were invited to meetings, for a population zone of approximately 3.8 million (Minneapolis -St. Paul, the “Twin Cities”). We plan to invite more 
than 300 individuals and organizations for a population zone of approximately 6.5 million (Dallas-Fort Worth). In in addition to a formal meetings, the EvK Trial research team will also 
be available to meet with community leaders and community members on an as-needed basis. 
Appendix 9 shows a draft letter that will be sent to community leaders.   
An initial outreach meeting will be scheduled with the aforementioned individuals or 
their representatives in Appendix 8. The background and rationale for the clinical trial will be discussed. The clinical trial feedback mechanisms will be presented. A writt en report of this 
meeting will be generated and sent to the UT -Southwestern IRB and the Parkland Memorial 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815320] .

Page 36 of 68 FDA 21 CFR 50.24 mandates that the public b e notified directly of the EvK Trial. This 
notification will be done using a three-pronged approach: Direct outreach by [CONTACT_815358], formal advertising and press release in traditional media, posters and / or flyers, and 
formal advertising in online  media. This outreach will be done bilingually (English and Spanish), 
which reflects the two most -common languages spoken at Parkland Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Direct 
community outreach and notification will be guided by [CONTACT_815359][INVESTIGATOR_307]. Generally this is Dallas County.  
1. Direct O utreach to the C ommunity 
Two community meetings will be scheduled prior to the start of the EvK Trial. 
There will be bilingual information at each meeting (English and Spanish). These 
meetings will be advertised through local news media, and through the study website (www.evkclinicaltrial.org
, or similar, yet to be established). A dr aft version of the 
website is included in Appendix 8. The public at -large will be offered a chance to hear 
about the study and have their questions answered. A formal written report of these meetings will be generated and sent to the UT -Southwestern IRB and Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815322]. In in addition to a formal sit- down meeting, the EvK Trial research team will be 
available to meet with community leaders and members on an as- needed basis.  
There are several additional avenues of community outreach that may be pursued: 
Additional outreach may be conducted in conjunction with leadership of the Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815323]. The Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815324].  Similarly, the UT-Southwestern Center for Patient Centered Outcomes Research has a Community Advisory Panel that may be contact[CONTACT_815360]  – NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

resource of the Center for Translational Medicine) maintains a database of community 
volunteers who are non-patients, but have agreed to be contact[CONTACT_398373]. Pending budget and availability this database may be enlisted to help with dissemination of information.  
2. Formal advertising in traditional media  
The EvK Trial will be advertised by [CONTACT_815361], and in Al Dia Dallas, one of the local Spanish language publications. The advertisement will list the study website and feedback mechanisms listed above , and will 
likely appear in both the print and online version of the newspapers . The advertisement 
will notify the public of the community meetings. A draft advertisement is provided in 
Appendix 11. Additionally, Mike Malaise, the Senior Vice President of Communications & External Relations at Parkland Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815325], budget and space permitting. These newspapers include the Dallas Weekly, Dallas Examiner, El Heraldo News, Da llas Voice, and 
Southern Dallas Magazine. A formal written report of these efforts will be generated and sent to the UT-Southwestern IRB and Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815320].  
3. Formal advertising in online media

General content of c ommunity notification (including meetings, advertisements, website)  
The content presented to in Section I will include broad information about the rationale, 
design, background and study procedures of the EvK Trial. Information will be available in both English and Spanish language versions. Specific items to be presented / discussed include the following:  
1. What is emergency endotracheal intubation, and why patients need emergency endotracheal intubation. 
2. Current practices for emergency endotracheal intubation, locally and nationally. Specifically which drug(s) are commonly used for this procedure. 
3. Background information for which drugs are commonly used for emergency endotracheal intubation, and the risks/benefits of common drugs.  
4. An explanation of the EvK Trial study protocol. 
5. An explanation for why we cannot gain written informed consent prior to enrolling / randomizing patients in  this trial.

Page 40 of 68 questions, to provide an indication of the willingness of subjects at- risk for emergency intubation 
to participate in the study. In theory it would be good to identify patients at high- risk for needing 
emergency intubation. However, we believe that it is very difficult to identify a group of patients 
who are stable enough on admission to read and comprehend a form, but who are at subsequent risk of being intubated. Clinically speaking we believe that this group of patients is likely to be vanishingly small. What’s far, far more common is that a patient comes into the ED in a critically ill “unstable” medical state, in no position to reasonably read and comprehend a form, 
and shortly thereafter requires emergency intubation. Based on this workflow we do not believe it is feasible to identify and notify patients who are especially at-risk for needing emergency 
endotracheal intubation.  
Assessment of Results of Community Consultation Plan  
Throughout the study we will track the results of our Community Consultation Plan. 
Based on published expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], we estimate that attendance at our community meetings may 
be approximately10 attendees for every 100 invitations (Salzman et al., 2007) based on direct invitation by [CONTACT_815364]. We will send direct invitation by [CONTACT_815365] 300 individuals and 
organizations listed  in Ap pendix 6, which suggests about 30 individual attendees from this effort 
alone. The print advertisements will appear in Al Dia Dallas (circulation 225,000) and the Dallas Morning News (circulation 400,000) will likely push this number upward, as will the direct outreach to the Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423624]-Southwestern Medical Center communities. Charge-per-click advertising will also likely push the number of attendees upward.  
Online charge-per-click advertising through www.google.com will begin prior to patient 
enrollment, and continue on a continuous basis until enrollment for the study is complete. Google advertising tracks metrics such as “ad impressions,” “click through rate,” and other

evaluated both online and telephone dialing protocol we solicited bids for both online polling and telephone polling. We received written bids from four companies: Google Consumer Surveys, 
WinningConnections Polling, PremiereReporting Polling, and AAM Political Polling. Telephone polling is outside of our financial means for the study, and so we will focus on online polling.  
Internet -based online polling has been validated compared to Random Digit Dialing 
(RDD)  teleph one poling in at least one study to date (Chang and Krosnick 2009). Online polling 
is heavily used in National Science Foundation (NSF)-Funded projects, for example the American National Election Study ( http://www.electionstudies.org/
).  Recent work by [CONTACT_815366] 2012 has reported that “Both African Americans and English -Speaking 
Latinos are as likely as whites to own any sort of mobile phone, and are more likely to use their platform for a w ider range of activities (Zikuhr and Smith 2012).” In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_815328]. Timothy J. Ryan, online survey- based polling without RDD is 
a reasonable approach for evaluating our CCP (Personal Communication from [CONTACT_815375] 11/9/2015).

The EvK  Trial will be registered with the US federal government at

with federal law. Additionally, following completion of the EvK Trial, we intend to make our 
findings publically known through one of the following mechanisms: publishing study results in a medical journal and/or publishing study results in news releases and news reports. The study website ( provisionally

Page 43 of 68 or is deceased, reasonable attempts at notification of the patient’s su rrogates, legal guardians or 
next-of- kin must be made. The EvK Trial will comply with these provisions.  
Following enrollment in the study, the study team will assess for the patient’s ability to 
discuss the clinical trail. Given the nature of this study (emergency endotracheal intubation), it is 
exceedingly unlikely that the patient will be able to participate in any meaningful discussion of research immediately after enrollment.  In the rare circumstance that the individual patient is able 
to participate in a meaningful discussion in a timely way , then the study team will discuss the 
nature of the research project, its goals and objectives and the study protocols. The study team will give  a letter notifying the patient of his/her enrollment into their medic al record (Appendix 
13). This will be documented in the patient’s study worksheet (Appendix 4) , and will complete 
the notification process. 
For a large percentage of patients enrolled in this trial, we anticipate that the patients will 
not be able to have a meaningful discussion about the study immediately after enrollment, and 
possibly not for many days after enrollment. In this case, the study investigators will attempt to 
contact [CONTACT_102]’s surrogates, legal guardians or next of kin, either in person at the patient’s 
bedside or by [CONTACT_756]. If the aforementioned parties can be reached, the EvK Trial team will discuss the nature of the research project, its goals and objectives and the study protocols. If the family, surr ogates, legal guardians or next- of-kin can be reached in person at the bedside or by 
[CONTACT_756], the notification process will be considered complete.  
 If the family, surrogates, legal guardians or next-of-kin cannot be reached in person or 
by [CONTACT_756], the EvK Trial t eam will send a letter to the patient’s last known physical address 
(Appendix 14). The letter in Appendix 13 will be sent in the event that the patient is alive. In the

Page 44 of 68 event that the patient is deceased, the research team will send the letter in Appendix 14. All of 
this will be documented in the patient’s study worksheet on the Study Workshe et (Appendix 4).  
During the notification process we will verbally request permission to use the patient’s 
anonymous data . If verbal permission is granted, we will docu ment that. If permission is denied, 
we will remove the patient’s data from the study (from the point of denial of permission onward). Following these efforts, the EvK Trial team will do one of the following:  
1. Document successful notification of the patient or family.  
2. Document no response from attempts at bedside and telephone contact. 
Summary of the C ommunity N otification Plan for the EvK Trial 
The EvK  Trial is a prospective randomized study that will randomize patients under 
emergency circumstances to receive either etomidate or ketamine for emergency endotracheal intubation. Because of the nature of emergency intubation, obtaining written informed consent prior to enrollment in the EvK Trial is not possible. In order to comply with current FDA guidelines for non-consented emergency research (FDA 21 CFR 50.24), the Community Consultation Plan in this document presents a broad -based approach to notify community leaders 
and community members, using traditional media as well as online media and direct community meetings. Patients (or their next-of-kin) enrolled in the EvK Trial will be notified of enrollment 
in accordance with FDA guidelines. Individuals in the catchment area of Parkland Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815329] a free MedAlert bracelet indicating that wish.

Dear (Community Leader ), 
 
I am one of the physicians at Parkland Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423624] -Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, TX. The 
purpose of this letter is to inform you of an upcoming clinical research tr ial known as “Etomidate versus ketamine 
for emergency endotracheal intubation : a prospective randomized clinical trial  (the EvK Trial).”   This clinical trial 
will be done at Parkland Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], starting  in 2016.  
 Why am I notifying you about this study?  
 The EvK Clinical Trial is a study of how to best take care of patients who require an emergency placement of a 
breathing tube. The purpose of the EvK Trial is to help us understand better which medicat ion – etomidate or 
ketamine – is better for patients during this procedure. Because we are studying an emergency condition,  it is not 
practical  to obtain written informed consent prior to study enrollment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) requires that I notify community leaders, and the community broadly, before starting this type of study. 
These regulations are outlined in FDA 21 CFR  50.24. Our study is discussed in detail on our website, 
www.evkclinicaltrial.org , and is also registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov
. 
 I would like to invite you, or your representative(s), to one of our community outreach meetings, listed below. 
Alternately I would be happy to speak with you in person, by [CONTACT_648], or by [CONTACT_815367].  The goal of these meetings is to answer any questions or concerns you might have about this study , and to 
ask for feedback . 
 Most sincerely yours,

Etomidate versus Ketamine for Emergency Endotracheal Intubation: A prospective 
randomized clinical trial (the EvK Trial)  
 
Brief Summary  
Patients who are having problems breathing sometimes require placement of a breathing tube in their mouth and 
windpi[INVESTIGATOR_5836]. The purpose of this breathing tube is to save the patient’s life. It is common to give the patient a 
medication to sedate him or her before the breathing tube is placed. For patients who are gravely ill two medications  
are commonly used: etmoidate or ketam ine. Both medications  have risks and benefits. We would like to do a study 
to figure out which one is better for our patients.  
 Detailed Summary  
Critically ill individuals who require emergency endotracheal intubation (placement of a breathing tube in the patient’s mouth) usually require sedation or anesthesia to make this process tolerable. There are several medication 
choices for anesthesia, including medications  like etomidate, ketamine and propofol. Of these, etomidate and 
ketamine are frequently used f or critically ill patients because they have minimal effects on the patient’s vital signs 
(blood pressure and heart rate). Both etomidate and ketamine are standard- of-care medications , locally and 
nationally, and both are frequently used to sedate a patien t for this procedure. Both etomidate and ketamine have 
side effects . One of the side effects of etomidate is that is suppresses the function of the adrenal glands. It is not 
known if this affects the patient’s outcome in a significant way. Ketamine has other side effects, such as slightly increasing the patient’s heart rate. It is not known if this affects the patient’s outcome in a significant way.   
 The EvK Trial will be conducted at Parkland Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815336], Emergency Medicine, Medicine / Critical Care Medicine, Surgery, and Pharmacy. The study will 
randomize critically ill patients who require emergency endotracheal intubation to one of two groups: Etomidate or Ketamine. We will observe the patient s’ outcomes. The only study intervention involves randomizing individual 
patients to one medication  or the other. All study follow -up beyond that point is done by [CONTACT_217703].  
 Because of the nature of this study – an emergency procedure on a critically ill patient – the study will require 
formal permission to by[CONTACT_815356] -enrollment written informed consent. The purpose of this website is to notify the 
public of this research project, in accordance with rules set forth by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA 21 CFR 50.24).

Links to FAQ’s  
1. Are etomidate and ketamine used frequently for emergency endotracheal intubation? 
Yes. Both are commonly used, and both are the “standard -of-care” locally and nationally.  
2. If both etomidate and ketamine are frequently used for this procedure, why are you doing the study?  
There is considerable debate right now regarding which medication  is better for patients. Each medication  
has side effects .  
3. What does it mean to “randomize” a patient?  
This means that individual patients who are enrolled in the study will receive either etomidate or ketamine. 
Which medication  they will receive will depend on random chance, similar to what happens with a coin 
toss. 
4. Besides receiving etomidate or ketamine, will patients in the study have any other study -related 
procedures?  
No. The only intervention for the study is the choice of etomidate or ketamine, which will be done by 
[CONTACT_515755]. Data will be gathered from the patient’s medical record after they enter the study, but this 
will not have any effect on medical care.  
5. Why won’t patients have a chance to sign a consent form before enrolling in the study?  
The EvK Trial is a study of an emergency medical procedure. The patients who are eligible for the study are critically ill and require immediate medical care (placement of a breathing tube), and therefore cannot 
give informed consent. After  a patient is enrolled in the study, the study team will  notify the patient and / or 
family of study enrollment, in accordance with FDA rules governing emergency medical research (FDA 21 CFR 50.24).  
6. Is it legal to do a research study on a patient before he  or she give written informed consent?  
Yes, provided the study complies with the regulations governing this type of research. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that in select cases of emergency research it is acceptable to do 
research without first obtaining written informed consent. Information about this can be obtained at the 
FDA website (linked here).  
7. Who is eligible to enroll in the study? Can patients volunteer for the study?  
The EvK Trial will enroll patients who are critically ill, and specifically those who require emergency  
placement of a breathing tube.  These patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_815338], or intensive 
care unit, who are there under emergency circumstances. Because of this, individuals cannot vol unteer for 
this study.  
8. How will the public be notified about the EvK Trial?  
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that several specific measures be taken for research in emergency medical conditions. These measures are described in FDA 21 CFR 50.24, and 
include things like (A) A meeting with community leaders and (B ) Outreach to the community at -large. 
The EvK Trial investigators have a comprehensive Community Outreach Plan that meets these 
requirements, and includes direct outreach to community leaders, media outreach, community outreach by 
[INVESTIGATOR_369510], and internet advertising and a study website (www.evkclinicaltrial.org).  
9. How many patients will enroll in the study?  
Approximately 750 patients will enroll.  
10. Will the study investigators make money off the results of this study?  
No. The EvK  Trial collaborators do not have a financial stake in the outcome of the study. The study is 
primarily funded by [CONTACT_815370] -Southwestern Medical Center . Both medications  used in the 
EvK Trial (etomidate and ketamine) are generic medications, and the study is not being done to market either medication . The EvK Tri al is not a “for profit” study. No drug companies, or their agents or 
representatives, were invol ved in the design of this study, and none will be involved in the conduct of the 
study.  Patients will not be billed or charged for study -related activities.

The EvK Clinical Trial  
at Parkland Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815341]: 
 
 The EvK Clinical T rial is a study of how to best take care of patients who require an emergency placement of a 
breathing tube. The purpose of the EvK Trial is to help us understand better which medication  – etomidate or 
ketamine – is better for patients during this procedur e. The full title of the study is “Etomidate versus ketamine for 
emergency endotracheal intubation: A prospective randomized clinical trial.” 
 
Because we are studying an emergency condition,  it is not practical to obtain written informed consent prior to s tudy 
enrollment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires notification of  community leaders, and the 
community broadly, before starting this type of study.

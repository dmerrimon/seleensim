Full study protocol  
Participants  
All procedures reported in this study were conducted and performed according to the protocols approved 
by [CONTACT_726021]’s Institutional Review Board (KSU IRB 2017 -63-HR) and carried out in accordance 
with the Declaration of Helsinki.   This study was also registered with clinicaltrials.gov (N CT03557476). 
Twenty -six elite male taekwondo athletes (mean age=18±1 ) with at least [ADDRESS_1010672] characteris tics can be seen in 
Table 1 . All participants were healthy and free from cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal diseases, and all 
participants received complete information about the study design and provided written informed consent. 
Participants were asked  to abstain from caffeinated drinks, alcohol, and antioxidant supplements during 
the whole period of the study. All participants had no history of chronic use of antioxidants or 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  
Study Design  
We used a double -blinded, parallel experimental design. Allocation was stratified for years of training (>3 
[n = [ADDRESS_1010673] group and n=13 in CON group]), and the sequence was generated by a computer -based 
number. All participants were randomly divided in a 1:1 fashion into  two groups: 1) a 5% weight loss 
with octacosanol intake group (OCT, n=13) and 2) a 5% weight loss with placebo group (CON, n=13) 
(Figure 1). A power analysis calculation (G*Power 3.1 Universität Kiel, [LOCATION_013]) determined a 
minimum sample size of 26 would allow the observation of a difference of 3% to 5% between the groups 
(OCT vs CON) on the primary study outcome variable of body weight with a power of 80%.  
Exercise Protocols  
Participants performed two hours of a taekwondo training program at the same time of day over six days 
in a training camp. The intensity of each training sessions was 70 -90% of predicted maximum heart rate. 
Subjects completed a [ADDRESS_1010674] atic stretching at the end of the training session. 
The training program can be seen in Table 2. Participants wore body protectors during the entirety of the 
training session and no injuries were reported. Subjects were allowed to drink water ad libitum du ring the 
training sessions.  
Dietary Intake  
The participants’ lifestyle was highly controlled by [CONTACT_739618], as the study 
was conducted at a training camp with food intake and physical activity being supervised by [CONTACT_739619]. Food logs were obtained during the training period. To lose weight, caloric restriction and 
exercise were used. Weight was measured every day before and after training sessions from each subject. 
The nutrient profile was 60% carbohydrates, 20% fats,  and 20% protein. Before intervention of caloric 
restriction, nutritionists calculated the subjects’ mean caloric intake for the last three days and made a 
plan for the intake of calories to be progressively reduced by 400 kcal per day, totaling ~2,400 kca l over 6 
days. Amount of meals were measured by [CONTACT_739620] ( HANA Instrument CO, LTD, Seoul, South Korea), 
and provided three times per day using a repeated treatment manner.  
Intake of Octacosanol  
Two capsules (20 -mg each) of 100% refined octacosanol powder f rom sugar cane (Swanson, Fargo ND, 
[LOCATION_003]) were consumed daily by [CONTACT_739621], one capsule [ADDRESS_1010675] acebo twice a day. The daily concentration of octacosanol was determined from a 
previous study (Arruza zabala et al. 2002) . 
Collection of Blood  
Before and after the six days of this study, blood samples were collected from each subject. Caffeine and 
any drugs related to vascular function were prohibited 24 hours prior to collection of blood samples. 15 
ml of blood were collected between 9 and 10 AM by [CONTACT_129325] (Bom Medrea Co, LTD, Phnom Penh, 
Cambodia) after subjects had fasted for 12 hours. The blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 
3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 ℃, and then plasma was collected and stor ed at -70℃ until analysis.  
Blood Lipid Profiles  
To examine the levels of plasma lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], HDL, LDL, TC, and TG were analyzed in duplicate using a 
chemistry analyzer ( HITACHI 7600 -210 & HITACHI 7180, Japan). Plasma samples were mixed with 
butylated hydroxyto luene and R1 reagent  and reacted for 60 min at 45 ℃. After the reaction, the mixed 
samples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min, and then supernatants were taken. The supernatants 
were read at 586 nm by a plate reader.   
Redox Balance Measurements  
Plasma  levels of superoxidade dismutase (SOD) were acquired by [CONTACT_739622] -WST (Cayman 
Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, [LOCATION_003]). Samples were mixed with WST working solution, and enzyme working 
solution, and then the samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 ℃. The absorban ces of the incubated 
samples were acquired at 450 nm by [CONTACT_739623]. The SOD activity was determined by [CONTACT_2329] a Cobas 
Mira chemistry analyzer ([COMPANY_002], Basel, Switzerland). Malondialdehyde (MDA)  was measured from 
BIOXTECHLPO -586 kit (OXIS Health Products, Inc, OR, [LOCATION_003]). The plasma samples were incubated 
with reagent diluent for 5 min at room temperature. The incubated samples were stimulated by [CONTACT_37370] -Cell 
total antioxidant control (Randox, Crumlin, County Antrim, [LOCATION_006]) , and then analyzed at 340 nm by [CONTACT_739624]. Plasma levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were acquired by [CONTACT_739625] (Cayman 
Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, [LOCATION_003]). Samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 ℃. The absorbances of the 
incubated samples were acqui red at 450 nm by [CONTACT_739623]. The GPx activity was determined by [CONTACT_2329] a 
Cobas Mira chemistry analyzer ([COMPANY_002], Basel, Switzerland). The plasma samples were incubated with 
reagent diluent for 5 min at room temperature. The incubated samples were stimulated  by [CONTACT_37370] -Cell total 
antioxidant control (Randox, Crumlin, County Antrim, [LOCATION_006]), and then analyzed at [ADDRESS_1010676] before and after the six -day 
training program using an eight -polar tactile -electrode impedance meter (InBody 720; Biospace, Seoul, 
Korea), which simultaneously recorded bodyweight, fat mass, and fat -free mass. Height was measured 
with a stadiometer to the nearest 1 cm. Body mass inde x (BMI) was calculated as weight/height2(Wong et 
al. 2018) . 
Statistical analysis plan  
Data were analyzed using a 2 x 2 analysis of variance (ANOV A) with repeated measures (group [OCT 
and CON] x time [before and after 6 days]). If a significant main effect or interaction was noted, a paired t 
test was used for within -group comparisons. Stati stical analysis was performed using Statistical Package 
for the Social Science (SPSS) version 21.0 (BM SPSS Analytics, Armonk, NY). The values were 
presented as mean and standard error. A value of P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE   
There are currentl y no proven treatment options for coronavirus disease (COVID -19), which is caused by 
[CONTACT_129721][INVESTIGATOR_7531] 2 (SARS -CoV-2). Human convalescent plasma has been 
successfully used for treatment of other severe coronavirus infections and  thus may provide an option 
for treatment of COVID -[ADDRESS_876565] a 
given infectious agent to a  susceptible or ill individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an 
infectious disease caused by [CONTACT_653116]. Experience from prior outbreaks with other coronaviruses, such 
as SARS -CoV-1, shows that convalescent plasma contains neutralizing antibodi es to the relevant virus 
(Zhang et al., 2005). In the case of SARS -CoV-2, the anticipated mechanism of action by [CONTACT_653117]. However, other mechanisms may be 
possible, such as antibody de pendent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis. Convalescent serum was 
also used in the [ADDRESS_876566] treatment (Sahr et al., 2017). The only antibody type that is currently available 
for immediate use against SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_876567] t hat passive antibody 
works by [CONTACT_228216], which is likely to be much smaller than that of established 
disease. Another explanation is that antibody works by [CONTACT_228217], which is 
also easier during the initial  immune response, which may be asymptomatic (Casadevall & Pi[INVESTIGATOR_129711], 
2003). As an example, passive antibody therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia was most effective when 
administered shortly after the onset of symptoms and there was no benefit if antibody admi nistration 
was delayed past the third day of disease (Casadevall & Scharff, 1994). For passive antibody therapy to 
be effective, a sufficient amount of antibody must be administered. When given to a susceptible person, 
this antibody will circulate in the b lood, reach tissues and provide protection against infection. 
Depending on the antibody amount and composition, the protection conferred by [CONTACT_653118].  
Experience with the use of convalescent plasma against  coronavirus diseases  
In the 21st century, there were two other epi[INVESTIGATOR_653099], SARS1 in [ADDRESS_876568] study involved the treatment of 80 
patients in Hong Kong with SARS (Cheng et al., 2005). Patients treated before day [ADDRESS_876569] asma in seriously ill individuals. Three patients with SARS in 
Taiwan were treated with 500 ml of convalescent plasma, resulting in a reduction in plasma virus titer 
and each survived (Yeh et al., 2005). Three patients with MERS in South Korea were treated  with 
convalescent plasma, but only two of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_653100] (Ko et al., 
2018). The latter study highlights a challenge in using convalescent plasma, namely, that some who 
recover from viral disease may not have high titers of neutralizing antibody (Arabi et al., 2016). 
Consistent with this point, an analysis of 99 samples of convalescent sera from patients with MERS 
showed that 87 had neutralizing antibody with a geometric mean titer of 1:61. This suggests that 
antibo dy declines with time and/or that few patients make high titer responses. It is also possible that 
other types of non -neutralizing antibodies are made that contribute to protection and recovery as 
described for other viral diseases (Gunn et al., 2018; van Erp, Luytjes, Ferwerda, & van Kasteren, 2019). 
There are reports that convalescent plasma was used for therapy of patients with COVID -19 in China 
during the current outbreak (Xinhua, 2020). Although few details are available from the Chinese 
experience and  published studies involved small numbers of patients, the available information suggests 
that convalescent plasma administration reduces viral load an d was safe.  
Overview of known potential risks  
Historical and current anecdotal data on use of convalescent plasma suggest it is safe in coronavirus 
infection. Therefore, the large number of exposed healthcare workers, public servants and first 
responders, in combination with high morbidity and mortality in severe COVID -19, particularly in elderly 
and vulnerable persons, suggest that the benefits of convalescent plasma outweigh its possible risks in 
patients with severe illness. However, for all cases where convalescent plasma administration is 
considered, a risk -benefit assessment must be conducted to assess individual variables.  
The theoretical risk involves the phenomenon of antibody -mediated enhancement of infection (ADE). 
ADE can occur for several viral diseases and involves an enhancement of disease in the presence of 
certain antibodies. For cor onaviruses, several mechanisms for ADE have been described and there is the 
theoretical concern that antibodies to one type of coronavirus could enhance infection to another viral 
strain (Wan et al., 2020). It may be possible to predict the risk of ADE of SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_876570] the same virus, SARS2 -CoV-2, ADE 
may be unlikely. The avail able evidence from the use of convalescent plasma in patients with SARS1 and 
MERS (Mair -Jenkins et al., 2015), and anecdotal evidence of its use in patients with COVID -19 (Xinhua, 
2020), suggest it is safe. Nevertheless, caution and vigilance will be requi red in for any evidence of 
enhanced infection. Another theoretical risk is that antibody administration to those exposed to 
SARSCoV -[ADDRESS_876571], passive antibody administration before vaccination with respi[INVESTIGATOR_653101] (Crowe, Firestone, & Murphy, 2001). This con cern will 
be investigated as part of this clinical trial by [CONTACT_653119]. If the concern proved real these individuals could 
be vaccinated against COVID -[ADDRESS_876572], there is a very small risk of 
allergy/anaphylaxis, or passive transfer of potential unknown infectious agents or infections. While most 
adverse effects are mild and transient i ncluding headaches, flushing, fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, 
diarrhea, transient changes in blood pressure and tachycardia, there is also the risk of transfusion 
related acute lung injury (TRALI), and transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO), wh ich could 
worsen hypoxemia in patients requiring supplemental oxygen or non -invasive or mechanical ventilation. 
Late adverse events are rare and include acute renal failure and thromboembolic events.  
Known potential benefits  
A benefit of convalescent pla sma administration is that it can prevent infection and subsequent disease 
in those who are at high risk for disease following close contacts of patients with COVID -19. This is 
especially so for those with underlying medical conditions. Many who will quali fy for prophylaxis are 
health care workers and first responders who are critical to maintenance of stability of the healthcare 
system.  
Passive antibody administration to prevent disease is already used in clinical practice. For example, 
patients exposed to  hepatitis B and rabies viruses are treated with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) 
and human rabies immune globulin (RIG), respectively. Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) 
(BIG -IV) is an intravenous preparation for infant botulism. In addition, passive antibody is used for the 
prevention of severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] (RSV) disease in high -risk infants. Until recently, 
polyclonal hyperimmune globulin (RSV -IG) prepared from donors selected for having high plasma titers 
of RSV neutralizing a ntibody, was used but these preparations have now been replaced by [CONTACT_316755], 
a humanized murine monoclonal antibody. Another potential benefit is societal: If the frequency with 
which exposed persons become infected decreases, the risk of further transm ission (R naught) might be 
reduced and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_129649]. Another avenue (not pursued in this protocol) is as a treatment for 
established infection. Convalescent plasma would be administered to those with clinical disease in an 
effort to reduce their sym ptoms and mortality. Based on the historical experience with antibody 
administration, it can be anticipated that antibody administration would be more effective in preventing 
disease than in the treatment of established disease. However, potential benefits  in patients with 
known infection include reduced severity of symptoms, reduced duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], reduced 
likelihood of death due to infection, and increased speed of recovery. Given that historical and current 
anecdotal data on use of convalesc ent plasma suggest it is safe in coronavirus infection, the high 
mortality of COVID -19, particularly in elderly and vulnerable persons, suggests that the benefits of its 
use in those at high risk for or with early disease outweigh the risks. However, for a ll cases where 
convalescent plasma administration is considered, a risk -benefit assessment must be conducted to 
assess individual variables.

permuted blocks of random block sizes, stratified by [CONTACT_1606] (US and Brazil) The assignment list is 
maintained by [CONTACT_653121], independent from the study, and then sent to the Principal 
Investigator/ research team for each participant that is deemed eligible.  
 
Study product considerations  
 
The preparation of the anti -SARS plasma and the control plasma will take place at the [LOCATION_001] City 
Blood Center and the CUIMC -NYPH Blood Bank will dispense the pla sma products. The plasma collection 
procedures are not part of this research protocol and are described in separate protocols, which has 
separate IRB approval (AAAS9845). The description below provides a summary of study product 
considerations as context.  
 
Collection:  
 
All activities pertaining to the collection and processing of plasma will take place at [[LOCATION_001] Blood 
Center/NYBC]. NYBC is one of the largest independent, community -based, nonprofit blood centers in the 
[LOCATION_002]. NYBC has a longstand ing research program and is well versed in the regulatory and 
ethical aspects of research, including clinical trials. The organization is FDA -licensed to produce 
convalescent plasma and AABB (American Association of Blood Banks) accredited, attesting to ro bust 
quality oversight of all operations. The donation and collection of donor convalescent plasma will occur 
under CUIMC IRB protocol AAAS9845.  
 
Collection and processing:  
 
• Standard apheresis plasma collection will be performed per routine standard oper ating procedure at 
the collection facility (NYBC). • As per routine practice, samples will be collected at time of donation for 
testing for transfusion -transmissible infections (all donors), ABO and red cell antibodies (all donors) and 
HLA antibodies (fema le donors with prior pregnancies). • Target collection volume: ~450 -600mL; this 
will allow for later splitting (separation) into 200 -250mL daughter units. • The plasma will be processed 
per routine practice; it will be frozen within 24hrs of collection per  AABB standards. • The plasma will be 
maintained in quarantine at the blood center pending laboratory test results (i.e. infectious screening, 
ABO and RhD status, Red cell and HLA antibodies). • If laboratory testing is acceptable (i.e. negative 
infectious  and antibody screening), the products will be distributed to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653104]. • 
In the event of an abnormal test result, the product will be discarded and the donor will be notified by 
[CONTACT_653122].  
 
Control arm  plasma:  
 
The control arm plasma follows identical collection and processing procedures, but will have been 
collected from community blood donors prior to documented SARS -CoV-2 in the [LOCATION_002] (i.e., to 
be conservative, all control arm plasma will be  the oldest available plasma and should be from 
collections prior to 31 December 2019).  
 
Rationale for dosing:  
 
We will utilize 1 unit (200 -250 mL) of plasma with anti -SARS -CoV-2 antibody. Dosing was based on 
experience with previous use of convalescent p lasma therapy in SARS1 where 5 mL/kg of plasma at titer 
≥ 1:160 was utilized [European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases: official publication 
of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology. 2005; 24(1):44 - 6.]. Historical precedence  allowing for 
0.[ADDRESS_876577] order linear proportionality, 
3.125mL/kg of plasma with titer >1:64 would provide equivalent immunoglobulin level to one quarter of 
5ml/kg plasma with titer ≥ 1:160. For a typi[INVESTIGATOR_421996] (~80 Kg) this would result in 250 mL of plasma 
(3.125ml/kg x 80kg = 250 mL > 1:64).  
 
Study drug administration:  
 
• Drug will be administered within 48 hours of randomization. • Infusion rate ≤ 250 mL/hour at 
physician discretion • Pretrea tment to minimize transfusion reactions (e.g. acetaminophen, 
diphenhydramine) will not be given, but will be available as needed to treat fever or allergic reaction. 
For severe allergic reactions corticosteroids (e.g., 125mg solu -medrol IV) may be used. Fo r rare severe 
anaphylaxis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_653105]. • If an AE develops during infusion, the infusion may be 
slowed or stopped as per investigator’s decision. • Most reactions to plasma are relatively minor and the 
infusion can generally be continued . Infusion site burning and non -allergic systemic effects can generally 
be managed with slowing of the infusion. Infusion is generally stopped in cases of itching; participant is 
treated and then infusion cautiously re -started. • Severe allergic reactions generally require 
discontinuation of the infusion. These include: • Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798]: dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, 
hypoxemia  A decrease in systolic blood pressure to < 90 mmHg or >30% decrease from baseline or a 
diastolic drop of >30% from baseline. •  Tachycardia with an increase in resting heart rate to > 130bpm; 
or bradycardia.  
 
Concomitant medications will be documented on the CRF:  
 
• Prescription medications • Over the counter medications • Herbal treatments/nutritional supplements 
• Blood products  
 
Prohibited Medications:  
 
Any approved or investigational drug* with established or potential activity against SARS -CoV-2 given 
within 24 hours of plasma infusion. *Concurrent use of Remdesivir as treatment for COVID -19 during the 
course of the study is permitted.  
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA MANAGEMENT  
 
Design Overview  
 
This randomized blinded phase 2 trial will assess the efficacy and safety of anti -SARS -CoV-2 plasma 
among adults with severe COVID -19. Eligible participants will be randomized i n a 2:1 ratio to receive 
anti-SARS -CoV-2 plasma or fresh frozen plasma without known anti -SARS -CoV-2 antibodies. We plan to 
enroll up to 220 participants (US and Brazil). Each participant will be evaluated at baseline and daily 
during the follow -up period using a seven -category severity scale: 1. Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653106], 2. Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], but unable to resume normal activities, 3. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not 
requiring supplemental oxygen, 4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring supplemental oxygen , 5. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
requiring high ---flow oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, 6. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), invasive mechanical ventilation, or both, and 7. Death.  
 
According to the inclusion/exclus ion criteria, all enrolled participants will have a score ranging 3 —6 on 
this scale at baseline. The primary study endpoint is defined as the Day 28 outcome on the scale.  
 
Safety will also be evaluated daily. Secondary endpoints include:  
• SARS -CoV-2 PCR positivity from nasopharyngeal swab, collected on baseline (Day 0), Days 7, and 14. • 
Levels of SARS -CoV-2 RNA on Days 0, 7, and 14. • During of need for supplemental oxygen and/or 
mechanical ventilation • Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] • Mortality.  
 
Statisti cal Analysis  
 
• Efficacy Objective  
 
1. Primary Analysis, go/no -go decision, and power consideration  
 
The primary analysis of the endpoint will be a one -sided nonparametric stratified Mann -Whitney test; 
stratification is done by [CONTACT_1606] (US, Brazil). A “go decision” in this phase 2 trial will be a one -sided 
P<.015 , suggesting evidence of promise of the treatment arm for further investigation in a phase 3 trial. 
Adaptive seamless phase 2/3: The results in this proof -of-concept study will be used to plan the s ample 
size in a Phase 3 trial, which may include the data in this Phase 2 in the final analysis using adjusted P 
value as in a seamless phase 2/3 trial. Details of P value adjustment and sample size calculation will be 
decided before the final analysis of this study data.  
 
The calculation was based on blinded pooled data of the Day 28 outcome and an odds ratio of 1.7 under 
a proportional odds assumption. With a 2:1 randomization ratio and a total sample size of 219 
participants (146 in convalescent plasma v s. 73 control), a onesided Mann Whitney test at 15% level will 
have about 82% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.7. Since the difference in power between 219 and 
220 is minimal, N=219 can be used to justify an enrollment total of 220. We note a recent stud y of 
antiviral drug yields an odds ratio of 1.15, with 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.96, which covers our assumed odds 
ratio.  
 
2. Secondary and Ancillary Analyses  
 
All secondary and ancillary efficacy analyses will also be intent -totreat. With a sample size of 220, 
assum ing 20% mortality up top day 28, we expect a total of 43 events. Longitudinal data collected over 
multiple days during the study period (e.g., PCR positivity, RNA) will be analyzed using the framework of 
generalized linear mixed model. Time -to-event variab les (e.g., time to death) will be analyzed using Cox 
proportional hazards model. Continuous variables (e.g. duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be analyzed 
using Mann Whitney test. Treatment effects on these variables will be estimated with 95% confidence 
intervals.  
 
3. Safety Analyses  
 
Serious adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_653123] 95% confidence 
intervals for the two study arms. Relative safety profile of the two arms will be compared using Fisher’s 
exact test.  
 
4. Missing da ta and non -compliance  
 
We will compare the missing data patterns between the study arms; and perform sensitivity analyses 
using different imputation approaches. However, due to the short study period, we anticipate minimal 
missing data. All efficacy analy ses will be done intent -to-treat, although as -treat analyses will also be 
conducted as sensitivity.

Adverse event reporting  
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject 
administered an investigational product, including any abnormal sign, symptom or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participat ion in research, whether or not considered related to the 
subject’s participation in the research.  
 
An AE does not include the following: • Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, and transfusion. The condition that le d to the procedure may be an AE and must be 
reported. • Preexisting diseases, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present or detected before the 
screening visit that do not worsen • Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred 
(e.g. , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], social and/or convenience admissions) • Any medical condition 
or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the investigational product is 
administered to the subject and not related to a  protocol -associated procedure is not an AE. It is 
considered to be preexisting and should be documented as medical history.  
 
Preexisting events or conditions that increase in severity or change in nature after the subject receives 
the investigational pro duct will be considered AEs.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  any adverse event temporarily associated with the subject's participation 
in research that meets any of the following criteria: • Results in death; • Is life -threatening (places the 
subject at im mediate risk of death from the event as it occurred); • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448]; • Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; • 
Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or • Any  other adverse event that, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, may jeopardize the subjects' health and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653108] – any AE that results in prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_601329] a SAE. Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as 
an AE if the condition meets the criteria for an AE. Neither the condition, prolonged hosp italization nor 
surgery are reported as an AE in the following circumstances: • Prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653109] a preexisting co 144ndition. Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an AE if the purpose of  the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was 
uneventful. • Prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653110].  
 
An Unanticipated Problem (UP) is any incident, experience or outcome involving risk to subjects or 
others in any human subjects research that meets all of the following criteria: • Unexpected (in terms of 
nature, severity or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the IRB -approval 
protocol and informed consent document, and  (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied; • Related or possibly related to participation in such research (i.e., there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_653124]); and • Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic or social harm) than was previously known or recognized  
 
A Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that it was 
caused by [CONTACT_33641]. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE. Examples of reasonable possibility are: • A single occurrence of a n event 
that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure. • One or more occurrences 
of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the 
population exposed to the drug. • An aggregate analy sis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that 
indicates that those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or 
historical control group.  
 
Inve stigator Reporting Requirements  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_653111] 48 hours of becoming 
aware of the event. The report to the IND sponsor will include the study investigator’s preliminary 
assessment of seriousness, severity and relatedness t o the investigational product.  
 
To IRB: Unanticipated Problems (UPs) must be reported promptly, but not later than 7 calendar days 
following the occurrence of the UP or the Principal Investigator’s acquiring knowledge of the UP.  
 
To DSMB: Serious adverse  events not constituting an unanticipated problem is to be reported to the 
DSMB and the IND sponsor. Reporting should occur within 48 hours of knowledge of the SAE 
occurrence.  
 
IND Sponsor Reporting Requirements  
 
The IND sponsor will report the following  SARs to the FDA: • To the FDA, as soon as possible, but no 
later than 7 calendar days after the SI's initial receipt of the informatio n, any unexpected fatal or life -
threatening SAR. • To the FDA and all participating investigators, as soon as possible bu t no later than 15 
calendar days after the S -I determines that information qualifies for reporting, in an IND safety report, 
any SAR that is both serious and unexpected. • To the FDA and all participating investigators, as soon as 
possible but no later tha n [ADDRESS_876581] a significant risk in humans 
exposed to the drug. • To the FDA and all participating investigators, as soon as possible, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_876582] a significant risk in 
humans exposed to the drug. • To the FDA and all participating investigators, as soon as possible, but no 
later than 15 calendar days after the S -I determines that the  information qualifies for reporting, any 
clinically important increase in the rate of a Serious SAR over that listed in the protocol or Investigator 
Brochure. • Expected SAEs and AEs should be included in the IND Annual Reports.  
 
Follow -up information to  a safety report will be submitted as soon as the relevant information is 
available. However, if the results of a sponsor’s investigation show that an adverse drug experience not 
initially determined to be reportable are so reportable, the sponsor must rep ort such experience as soon 
as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_876583] (DSMB ), composed of independent experts without conflict of 
interests will be established. The Board will review the study before initiation and quarterly thereafter. 
The Board will review study data to evaluate the safety, efficacy, study progress, and conduct  of the 
study.  
 
Study monitoring  
 
As per ICH -GCP 5.18 and FDA 21 CFR 312.50, clinical protocols are required to be adequately monitored 
by [CONTACT_4530]. Monitors will verify that  
(1) There is documentation of the informed consent process and signed informed consent documents 
for each subject  
(2) There is compliance with recording requirements for data points  
(3) All SAEs are reported as required  
(4) Individual subjects’ study records and source documents align  
(5) Investigators are in compliance with the protocol  
(6) Regulatory requirements as per Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), FDA, and applicable 
guidelines (ICH -GCP) are being followed.  
 
Halting Criteria for the Study  
 
The study enrollment and dosing will be stopped and an ad hoc review will be performed if any of the 
specific following events occur or, if in the judgment of the study physician, subject safety is at risk of 
being compromised:  
1. Unexpected death of a do sed subject in relation to infusion  
2. Occurrence of a life -threatening allergic/hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylaxis), manifested by 
[CONTACT_653125].  
3. One subject with an unexpected SAE associated with study product.  
4. Two subjects with a Grade [ADDRESS_876584] and that may appear minor in terms of individual events 
but that collectively may represent a serious potential concern for safety.  
6. Any other event(s) which is considered to be a serious adverse event in the good clinical judgment of 
the responsible physician. This will be appropriately documented.  
 
Furthermore, given that ADE may be an issue with convalescent antibody treatment, out of an 
abundance of caution we will monit or the number of subjects in each trial arm that progresses to an 
indication for need of mechanical ventilation. In monitoring the number of subjects that progresses to 
this stage, we will present these data to the DSMB and a masked outcomes accessor so th at they may 
objectively evaluate and determine whether they would like to be unmasked. After at least 50% of trial 
participants have accumulated follow -up, the number of subjects that progress to this stage will be 
presented to the masked outcomes assessor  and formally asked whether they (1) see a clinically 
meaningful difference between trial arms and (2) if so do they require a formal interim analysis. At any 
point should the DSMB require a formal interim analysis, we will examine the difference in treatm ent 
arms for need for mechanical ventilation. This interim analysis will adjust for factors related to need for 
mechanical ventilation including age and presence of cardiopulmonary comorbidities.  
 
Upon completion of this review and receipt of the advice o f the DSMB, the IND sponsor will determine if 
study entry or study dosing should be interrupted or if study entry and study dosing may continue 
according to the protocol. Should the trial not be stopped at this time point, the final analysis would 
need to account the number of interim analyses that were conducted. Therefore, we would penalize any 
final analysis dividing our 0.05 alpha in half for each interim analysis.

6 2.0 TRIAL DESIGN  
2.1 Trial Design  
This is a single center, open label, pi[INVESTIGATOR_79382] -cel in 
subjects with relapsed or refractory large B -cell lymphoma . A maximum of 20 subjects will 
be enrolled in this trial to examine the safety, tolerability and efficacy  of anakinra 
administered subcutaneously at a dose of 100 mg daily  (N=10) or 100 mg BID  (N=10) , 
starting on day 0 of axi-cel infusion, for 7 days. A 3+ 3 design will be used for a safety run -
in phase within each dose level cohort. Adverse events  (AEs) will be monitored throughout 
the trial and graded in severity according to the guidelines outlined in the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. ASTCT consensus 
guidelines will be applied to grade CRS and ICANS. Response will be determined according to the Recommendations for Initial Evaluation, Staging, and Response Assessment of Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma: The Lugano Classification .
1 
Patients will be followed until documented progression of disease (PD), unacceptable AE(s), 
intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  investigator’s decision 
to withdraw the subject, subject withdraws consent, pregnancy of the  subject, noncompliance 
with trial treatment or procedure requirements, administrative  reasons , or the subject has 
completed [ADDRESS_86713] will be followed for 
30 days for AE  monitoring (serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected for 30 days after 
the end of treatment). Subjects  who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease 
progression will have post -treatment  follow- up for disease status until disease progression, 
initiating a non -study cancer  treatmen t, withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow -up. 
The primary objective of the trial is to assess safety  and tolerability of anakinra in reducing 
incidence of CRS within 30 days after infusion of CAR T cells . Secondary objectives include 
incidence of different grades and duration of both CRS and ICANS, overall response rate 
(ORR) complete response rate (CRR), progression- free survival (PFS), and overall survival 
(OS). Exploratory objectives include evaluation of pharmacodynamics effects of anakinra, and biomarkers of toxicity, response and resistance.  This study will be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices. 
Specific procedures to be performed during the trial, as well as their prescribed times and  
associated visit windows, are outlined in the Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0. Details of each  
procedure are provided in Section 7.0 – Trial Procedures.

3.0 OBJECTIVE(S) & HYPOTHESIS(ES)  
3.1 Primary Objective(s) & Hypothesis(es)  
(1) Objective:  The primary objective of the study is to assess safety  and tolerability of anakinra 
in reducing incidence of CRS within 30 days after infusion of CAR T cells in subjects with 
relapsed or refractory large B -cell lymphoma . 
Hypothesis:  Anakinra will be safe, well -tolerated and effective in decreasing the incidence of 
axi-cel-related CRS in patients with r/r large B -cell lymphoma . 
3.2 Secondary Objective(s) & Hypothesis(es)  
(1) Objective: To determine incidence of all grades and duration of both CRS and ICANS.  
(2) Objective: To determine the CRR, ORR , PFS and OS. 
Hypothesis :  Administration of anakinra in the setting of axi -cel therapy will decrease 
incidence of all grades and duration of both CRS and ICANS  in patients with r/r large B -cell 
lymphoma. Response rates and survival with anakinra and axi -cel therapy will be comparable 
to those observed with axi- cel alone in patients with r/r large B -cell lymphoma.  
3.3 Exploratory Objective 
(1) Objective:  To determine  the effects of anakinra on the cytokine and chemokine profile in 
peripheral blood after CAR -T therapy.

8 4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
4.[ADDRESS_86714]- and second- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_79383] B -cell lymphoma . Approximately 
60% of patients affected by [CONTACT_79411] B -cell lymphoma are cured with the use of frontline 
chemoimmunotherapy.2-4 Salvage high- dose chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_79412].5 However, only 50% of 
patients who relapse after frontline chemoimmunotherapy are transplant -eligible, because of 
age, performance status or comorbidities. Of these, only half will respond to salvage 
chemotherapy, and of those who will respond and will be able to proceed to transplant, less than half will be cured.
6,7 As a consequence, novel effective and safe therapi[INVESTIGATOR_79384] B -cell lymphoma.   
 CAR T cell biology . Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cells are a form of adoptive 
cellular therapy, employing genetically engineered T lymphocytes, created in the laboratory in 1989, but refined and brought to the clinic only in the last few years.
8 Autologous T cells 
are collected from the patient usually through leukapheresis, engineered with CAR and expanded ex vivo, and subsequently reinfused (ideally after conditioning). Unlike donor T lymphocytes employed in allogeneic stem cell transplant or endogenous T cells that recognize unique antigens expressed on tumor cells through a HLA -restricted manner via 
their naturally expressed T -cell receptor, CAR T cells recognize antigens on tumor cells in 
an HLA -independent mechanism via their artificially ex pressed receptor. This allows broad 
therapeutic use of CAR T cells generated from either autologous or allogeneic source and also likely overcomes tumor escape mediated by [CONTACT_79413].
[ADDRESS_86715] generation CAR T cells . CARs are formed of 3 parts: an extracellular, a transmembrane 
and an intracellular domain. The extracellular domain is usually a single -chain variable 
fragment (scFv) derived from the variable heavy and light chains of an antibody targeting a specific tu mor antigen (e.g. CD19 in B -cell lymphomas). Upon engagement with its cognate 
antigen, the extracellular domain initiates the activation signal to the CAR T cell via the intracellular domain.
[ADDRESS_86716] generation of CAR T cells was composed of an extracellular 
domain recognizing a target tumor antigen, and an intracellular signaling domain, CD3ζ, which mediates signal 1 to the T-lymphocyte. However, limited efficacy was observed with this stru cture.
11  
Second generation CAR T cells . In t he second  generation CAR s, the intracellular domain is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_79385]: CD3ζ to provide signal [ADDRESS_86717] commonly used co- stimulatory domains are CD28 
and CD137 (4- 1BB).
12 Investigators at Baylor College of Medicine treated 6 patients affected 
by [CONTACT_79414] B -cell lymphoma (including DLBCL, t -FL and chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia [CLL]) with an anti- CD19 CAR T cell product, engineered to express CD28 as co -
stimulator y domain. No conditioning regimen was used. As opposed to first -generation CAR 
T cells, persistence of the product was observed up to [ADDRESS_86718] was used at the same time by [CONTACT_79415] (NCI), first in a patient with relapsed FL, and subsequently in 15 patients

However, grade 3 or greater toxicity was observed in all patients, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, but all resolving within [ADDRESS_86720], in a

 Multicenter axi -cel trial and FDA approval . The encouraging results observed with 
axicabtagene ciloleucel  or axi -cel (the 2nd generation CAR developed at the NCI ) led to its 
evaluation further  in a multicenter single- arm phase II clinical trial in relapsed or refractory 
aggressive B -cell lymphomas, the ZUMA -1 study. Seven patients with relapsed or refractory 
DLBCL were enrolled in the phase I component of the ZUMA -1 trial, and conditioning 
consisted of both cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.17 In the subsequent phase II component 
of the study, 101 patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, t-FL and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) were treated using the same conditioning regimen. In the 
combined phase I plus phase II study of 108 patients, ORR was 83%, CR rate 58%, and grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) and immune -cell associated neurotoxicity 
syndrome (ICANS)  were reported in 1 1% and 32% of patients, respectively.
18,[ADDRESS_86721] 2 lines of systemic therapy. Recently, the long term activity of axi -
cel has been reported: at a median follow -up of 27.1 months, the median progression- free 
survival was 5.9 months, median overall survival has not been reached, and 39% of the patients were in ongoing remission.
19 Improved therapeutic and preventive treatments 
require a better understanding of CRS and ICANS physiopathology, which has so far remained elusive.  
4.1.2 Physiopathology of CRS and ICANS  
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) . CRS results from rapid activation and proliferation of 
CAR T cells, with subsequent supraphysiologic release of pro- inflammatory cytokines from 
the CAR T cells themselves as well as by[CONTACT_79417].[ADDRESS_86722] with fever, 
hypotension, hypoxia, and signs/symptoms of organ dysfunction. CRS typi[INVESTIGATOR_79387] T cell expansion, and resolves within [ADDRESS_86723] patients experience grade 1 -2 CRS, however, severe toxicity may occur 
in patients with bulky disease. Severe CRS has been associated with serum IL -6 levels and 
tocilizumab, an anti -IL-6 receptor antibody, has been used successfully for CRS 
management . Severe CRS, refractory to tocilizumab, may require use of corticosteroids, 
which can suppress multiple immune cells and downregulate production of multiple cytokines.
23 Rarely, patients may develop fulminant macrophage activating syndrome or 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis following CAR T therapy.18,23 Such patients are also 
initially managed with anti- IL6 and corticosteroid therapy, before considering other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_79388].24

10 Immune cell -associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) . The pathophysiology of 
neurotoxicity, also referred to as CAR -related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) or immune 
effector cell -associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), remains largely unknown.20,[ADDRESS_86724] patients experience grade 1 -2 
neurotoxicity and it is usually self -limiting and completely reversible. Neurotoxicity 
occurring concurrently with CRS can be successfully treated with CRS -directed therapy. 
However, severe neurotoxicity occurring in the absence of CRS may require use of corticosteroids and intensive monitoring and supportive care through a multidisciplinary team.
23 
 
4.1.3 Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  with Anakinra  
Role of IL -1 in CRS and ICANS. To study CRS in the absence of GVHD,  Norelli et al used 
human T cells that had  matured in humanized mice and hence were tolerant to mouse 
antigens (xenotolerant).28 When infused into humanized mice, CD19- and CD44v6- modified 
CAR -Ts expanded in response to human CD19+ B cells and CD44v6+ monocytes eliminated 
these normal cells and induced severe CRS -like toxicity that was enhanced in the presence  
of tumor. As greater monocyte numbers in humanized mice were associated with  more severe 
CRS, the authors investigated the role of monocytes in CRS. Monocyte  depletion in tumor -
bearing, humanized mice before CAR -T infusion completely eliminated CRS without 
preventing leukemic remission. However, tumor  elimination was delayed, and CAR -T 
expansion was reduced. Further, CD44v6 CAR -Ts used to eliminate human  monocytes in 
mice before leukemia engraftment responded poorly to leukemic cells, and tumor responses were reduced.  These results suggest that myeloid cells  may be important for CAR -T efficacy 
in addition to having a role in CRS . In addition, to study the role of cytokines in the induction 
of CRS, Norelli et al evaluated the kinetics of cytokine production by [CONTACT_79418]-cultures with CD19.CAR T cells and leukemic cells. IL -1 preceded IL -6 by 24 h. Giavridis 
et al produced a CRS -like syndrome in immunodeficient  beige mice after infusion of 
CD19.28z CAR -Ts, but only if the CAR- Ts were  infused intraperitoneally and only in mice 
with a high tumor burden.
29 Notably, CRS  was not induced in more immunodeficient  NSG 
mice using the same conditions, likely because unlike beige mice, NSG  mice harbor defects 
in (IL -6- and IL -1-producing) monocytes and macrophages. CRS in beige mice was 
accompanied by  [CONTACT_79419], mostly  macrophages, into the tumor site and the 
spleen . Intratumoral murine  macrophages were the major source of  lL-6, and a murine IL -6-
receptor antibody infused at the time of CAR T cell infusion  prevented CRS -induced 
mortality, showing that human CAR -Ts are able to activate murine macrophages. CRS was 
enhanced  by [CONTACT_79420]40 ligand on the human CAR -Ts, highlighting the  
importance of cell -to-cell contact [CONTACT_79421] -Ts. This  interaction 
induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) from tumor- infiltrating  macrophages . 
Pre-clinical activity of anakinra for CRS and ICANS. In their mouse model, Norelli et al

could also inhibit CRS  without loss of tumor control. This CAR -T intrinsic strategy could 
eliminate the  requirement for administration of expensive  recombinant proteins after CAR -
T infusion. 
Current clinical use of anakinra. Anakinra is currently approved for the treatment of patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have failed 1 or more lines of disease modifying anti -
rheumatic drugs, and for the treatment of patients with Neonatal -Onset Multisystem 
Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), a form of Cryopyrin- Associated Periodic Syndromes 
(CAPS) .31-34 Anakinra is used at the dose of 100 mg subcutaneously daily in RA, and 1-2 
mg/Kg (up to 8 mg/Kg) subcutaneously daily for patients with NOMID/CAPS. Every other 
day dosing is recommended in case of creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min.  In patients with 
RA, the m ost common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5%) are injection site reaction, 
worsening of RA , upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], headache, nausea, diarrhea, sinusitis, 
arthralgia, flu like -symptoms, and abdominal pain ; in patients with NOMID/CAPS, the most 
common AEs during the first 6 months of treatment (incidence >10%) are injection site 
reaction, headache, vomiting, arthralgia, pyrexia, and nasopharyngitis . For study details 
please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_86726] Population  
As described above, IL-1 blockade can associate with reduction of CRS and ICANS, without 
affecting axi -cel efficacy . Therefore, administration of anakinra without affecting efficacy 
may increase the safety and potentially the efficacy of axi -cel in patients with relapsed or 
refractory large B -cell lymphoma . Based on the known mechanisms of action of anakinra 
and axi-cel and the ir established safety profile , the combination is not expected to increase 
the toxicity of either agent. No other clinical trials are currently investig ating this 
combination, this being a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Given that t he many patients with relapsed or refractory 
B-cell lymphoma in need of CAR T cell therapy are older or with significant comorbidities , 
development of such therapeutic strategies that without affecting efficacy increase safety and 
potentially the efficacy of axi -cel is highly desirable. 
4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
The absolute bioavailability of anakinra after a 70 mg subcutaneous bolus injection was 
evaluated in 11 healthy subjects and was  95%. In 18 subjects with RA, maximum plasma 
concentrations occurred 3 to 7 hours after administration at clinically relevant doses (1 to 2

placebo -contr olled trials of 1392 patients > 18 years of age with active RA . An additional 
fourth study was conducted to assess safety.35 In the efficacy trials, anakinra was studied in 
combination with other disease -modifying antirheumatic drugs (studies 1 and 2) or as a 
monotherapy (study 3). The highest investigated dose was [ADDRESS_86728] serious 
adverse reactions were neutropenia (any grade, 8% of patients) and infections (grade 3 -4 in

The safety and efficacy of anakinra have also been investigated in an open label study 
including 43 patients with NOMID/CAPS, using doses up to 8 mg/Kg daily, for up to [ADDRESS_86729] serious adverse reaction was represented by [CONTACT_79422], reported in 7 
patients (grade 3 -4), and more common in patients < 12 years. 
The dose of anakinra typi[INVESTIGATOR_79389] (100 mg daily) may or may not be biologically effective for the purpose of IL -1 blockade in patients with relapsed or 
refractory large B -cell lymphoma receiving axi -cel therapy. The 2 dose levels selected for 
this study (100 mg daily and 100 mg BID), corresponding to a dose ranging between 1 mg/Kg 
and 6 mg/Kg, are based on safety established in  clinical trials with doses as high as 8 mg/Kg, 
used for prolonged time. In addition, as the dosage form i s a pre- filled syringe of [ADDRESS_86730] week after axi-cel infusion. 
 
4.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety and Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary endpoint is the safety  and tolerability of anakinra in decreasing CAR T cell -
related toxicity measured as incidence of any grade CR within 30 days after infusion of CAR T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory large B -cell lymphoma.  Secondary efficacy 
endpoints will include incidence of different grades and duration of both CRS and ICANS,  
ORR, CR rate , PFS , and OS . Cheson 2014 Lugano Classification response criteria for 
malignant lymphoma  will be used to assess clinical responses .
1 After prolonged follow -up, 
use of axi -cel in patients with relapsed or refractory large B -cell lymphoma was associated 
with a n ORR of 83%, a CR rate of 58%, and a rate of grade 3 or higher CRS  and ICANS  of 
11% and 32%, respectively.18,[ADDRESS_86731] to observe a reduction in CRS and ICANS, 
without any additional AEs . We may also observe an improvement in ORR, CR rate, PFS 
and OS as compared with axi -cel monotherapy.

13 [IP_ADDRESS] Biomarker Research  
Blood samples and tumor biopsies will be obtained from consenting patients at baseline 
and/or on treatment from subject s enrolled on the study at the indicated time points shown 
in the Trial Flow Chart under Section 6.0. The overall goal of the biomarker studies is to 
identify pharmacodynamic effects  of anakinra combined with axi -cel therapy. Peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma  will be isolated from blood samples and 
cryopreserved for batched analysis. Both blood sample and tumor biopsy col lection are 
optional. 
PBMC samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_8622] 14- color multiparametric flow cytometry to 
determine the expansion, phenotype, and persistence of CAR T cells as well as alteration in 
the phenotype and number of multiple cellular components, including normal B and T 
lymphocytes, monocytes , and natural killer cells . Plasma  samples will be analyzed for 
alteration in various cytokines and chemokines. CAR T cell levels will also be monitored by

[IP_ADDRESS] Guidelines for Dose Modification  
Dose modifications of anakinra are not permitted within each subject. Any subject who 
experiences toxicity from anakinra may be discontinued from further injections of anakinra 
at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.  
5.1.5 Timing of Dose Administration 
Administration of conditioning chemotherapy . Subjects will receive cyclophosphamide 
(500 mg/m2/day) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) for [ADDRESS_86737] guidelines. The administration start/stop time of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and m esna will all be noted in the subject medical record . 
Administration of axi -cel. Subjects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79392]- cel infusion. Axi -cel 
treatment consists of a single infusion of CAR transduced autologous T cells administered on day 0 in under 30 minutes. Axi -cel will be infused intravenously via a central venous 
catheter at a do se of 2×10

T cells for patients weighing >[ADDRESS_86738] -axi-cel infusion. Subjects should not be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79393]-cel-related non -hematological toxicities return to ≤ grade 1 or baseline. Subjects may 
be discharged with non- critical and clinically stable or slowly improving toxicities (e.g., 
renal insufficiency) even if > grade 1, if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079]. 
Administration of anakinra. The study drug, anakinra will be administered daily by 
[CONTACT_79409] [ADDRESS_86739]  
6 hours prior to axi-cel infusion. T wo dose levels will be investig ated: 100 mg daily and 
100 mg BID . A 3+3 design will be used for a safety run -in phase within each dose level 
cohort. 
5.2 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited) 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required. The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician. However, the decision to continue the subject on trial therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the Investigator and the subject.

administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981].  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case rep ort form 
(CRF) including all prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV 
medications and fluids.  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF. Subje cts may remain 
on anti -coagulation therapy as long as the PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of the 
intended use of anticoagulants. 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_86741] dose of trial treatment sh ould be 
recorded for SAEs  as defined in Section 7.2. 
5.2.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_79394]: 
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Investigational agents other than anakinra  
• Radiation therapy  
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_86742] dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, 
the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed .  
• Systemic use of g lucocorticoids for any purpose other than for management of 
CAR -T associat ed toxicities during the first 3 0 days after axi -cel infusion. The use 
of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be allowed
 (</= 5 mg/day of prednisone 
or equivalent doses of other corticosteroids).  
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial. Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necess ary. 
5.3 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
5.3.1 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_79424]: 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
Protocol: 2019-1051                                             Phase II study of anakinra and axi- cel 
 
18 • Infection Prophylaxis : Subjects should receive prophylaxis for pneumocystis pneumonia, 
herpes simplex/zoster , and fungal infections according to standard institutional practice.  
• Tumor Lysis Syndrome : all subjects with significant malignancy burden and without a 
contradiction such as allergy should be started on prophylaxis (e.g. allopurinol) as per 
institutional guidelines prior to axi -cel infusion. Prophylaxis may be discontinued when 
the risk of tumor lysis has passed.  
• B Cell Depletion: it is possible that B cell depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia will 
occur due to the effects of axi -cel on normal B cells. Gammaglobulin will be administered 
for hypogammaglobulinemia according to institutional guidelines. 
• Fever and Neutropenia:  evaluation for source of infection, antipyretics, initiation of 
antibiotics, and comfort measures  including IV hydration should be performed per 
institutional guidelines.  
• Blood Product Support : all blood products should be irradiated. S ubject s should receive 
platelets and packed red blood cells as needed. Attempts should be made to keep hemoglobin >8.0 gm/dL and platelets > 10,000/mm3. Leukocyte filters should be utilized 
for all blood and platelet transfusions to decrease sensitization to transfused WBC’s and decrease the risk of CMV infection .   
[IP_ADDRESS] Supportive Care Guidelines for CRS and ICANS  
Acute toxicities associated with axi- cel infusion include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
and i mmune effector cell -associated  neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Efforts should be 
made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, or other causes prior to labeling an AE  
as CRS or ICANS .     
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) . CRS  is a symptom complex associated with the use of 
monoclonal antibodies and adoptive cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_79395]. The condition results from the release of cytokines from cells targeted by [CONTACT_79425], immune effector cells recruited to the tumo r area and subject’s immune cells activated during this process. 
When cytokines are released, a variety of clinical signs and symptoms associated with CRS present themselves including cardiac, gastrointestinal, laboratory (coagulation, renal and hepatic), neurological, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], skin, vascular (hypotension) and constitutional (fever, 
rigors, headaches malaise, fatigue arthralgia, nausea and vomiting). 
The goal of CRS management after  CAR T cell therapy is to prevent life -threatening 
conditions while preserving the benefits of antitumor effects. The ASTCT (American 
Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy) CRS Consensus Grading system will be used to assess the severity of CRS ( Appendix 2; Lee et al 2018 ) as well as guide 
management. However,  we will also capture the individual data elements to be able to 
assess the CRS according to the grading described by [CONTACT_43265] 2014 ( Appendix 3) in order 
to compare the toxicities to historical data. The diagnostic work- up and management of 
CRS will be performed  as per CARTOX Guidelines ( Appendix 5).  
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/ macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) . 
CRS and classic acquired  HLH/MAS have many shared features, and the [ADDRESS_86743] laboratory 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
Protocol: 2019-1051                                             Phase II study of anakinra and axi- cel 
 
19 results  that meet the classic criteria for HLH/MAS  such as elevation of ferritin , 
triglycerides, and soluble CD25 but may or may not  have hepatosplenomegaly, 
lymphadenopathy, or overt evidence  of hemophagocytosis. T he symptoms and signs 
suggestive of HLH/MAS subside with CRS resolution  in most patients . However , 
refractory and fulminant HLH/MAS  has been described in rare cases after  CAR T -cell 
therapy and may be treated as previously described using tocilizumab and corticosteroids 
with or without etoposide.23 
Immune effector cell -associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) . Neurotoxicity (e.g. 
encephalopathy, somnolence, aphasia) have been observed with anti -CD19 CAR T cell 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . The ASTCT Consensus Grading will be used for to assess the severity of ICANS 
(Appendix 4; Lee et al 2018) as well as guide the management. However, we will also 
grade and capture the symptoms and signs  of neurotoxicity as  per CTCAE v 5.0 in order 
to be able to  compare the toxicities to historical data. The diagnostic work- up and 
management of ICAN S will be performed as per CARTOX Guidelines ( Appendix 6).  
Endotracheal intubation may be needed for airway protection in severe cases. Corticosteroids may be considered for any severe or life -threatening neurotoxi city and anti -
seizure and sedatives may be considered as clinically indicated.  If there is no 
contraindication, subjects will receive levetiracetam (750  mg PO or IV BID) for seizure 
prophylaxis starting on Day 0. Levetiracetam may be tapered and discontinued after day 30. 
5.[ADDRESS_86744] -feeding women 
may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive. Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study. The two birth control methods can be either two barrier methods or a barrier method plus  a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. Subjects should 
start using birth control from study visit [ADDRESS_86745] dose of study therapy.  
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, 
condom (by [CONTACT_3969]), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide. Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents). 
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks 
to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to participate in the study they must adhere  to the contraception requirement (described 
above) for the duration of  the study and during the  follow- up period defined in section 
7.2.2- Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to Sobi . If there is any question that a subject

Protocol: 2019-[ADDRESS_86746]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to Sobi without delay and 
within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or 
newborn). The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to Sobi. If a 
male subject impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported to Sobi and followed as described above 
and in Section 7.2.2. 
5.4.[ADDRESS_86747] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur. In addition, a subject may be withdrawn by [CONTACT_79426], the trial plan is 
violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons. Specific details regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 7.1.4. 
A subject must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons: 
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws 
consent. 
• Confirmed radiographic disease progression 
• Unacceptable AEs  (grade > 3 AE lasting > 2 weeks) 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject 
• The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test 
• Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements  
• The subject is lost to follow -up 
• Administrative reasons

7.1.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Monitoring  
The investigator or a physician designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential 
new or worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically indicated. Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during the follow -up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 5.0. CRS and ICANS will 
be graded according to the AS TCT consensus guidelines  and Lee et al [ADDRESS_86758] to trial treatment.  
Please refer to section 7.2 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Full Physical Exam  and Vital Signs 
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a full physical exam during the 
screening period. After the first dose of trial treatment new clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as AEs. The investigator or qualified designee will also take 
vital signs at screening, prior to the administration of each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0). Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], weight and blood pressure , oxygen 
saturation . Height will be measured at screening only. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Neurocognitive Assessment and Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
Neurocognitive assessments will be standardized by [CONTACT_79430]- Effector Cell -
Associated Encephalopathy (ICE) Score as per ASTCT consensus grading ( Appendix 4). 
A full neurological assessment will be completed during screening to establish a baseline. Subsequent assessments will be performed before axi -cel administration on Day [ADDRESS_86759]

contrast will be used for initial disease assessment  unless there is a contraindication . 
Disease assessments or scans performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as the screening scan if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within [ADDRESS_86761] dose of trial treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Disease Assessment During Trial  
Disease response assessments will occur 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, then at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24. There is a ±14- day window for all imaging assessments. Disease 
response assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_79433] -CT scan at the indicated time 
points (see Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0).  
In subjects achieving a complete remission by [CONTACT_79434], PET -CT scan will be 
repeated once to confirm response. In addition, unilateral bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_79398]. Disease assessments and imaging should continue to be performed until documented 
disease progression, the start of new anti -cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, 
or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood Sampling and Tumor Tissue Collection  for Correlative Studies  
Biomarker analysis will be performed on blood and tumor samples to evaluate the effects of anakinra on mechanisms of CRS, ICANS and on the function of infused CAR T cells. Prognostic markers in large B -cell NHL may also be evaluated.  
The expansion, persistence, and immunophenotype of transduced anti -CD19 CAR+ T cells 
will be monitored in the blood primarily by [CONTACT_79435], complemented by [CONTACT_4133].

Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6.0 - Trial Flow Chart. Specific procedure-
related details are provided above in Section 7.1 - Trial Procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening  Period  
Approximately 28 days prior to enrollment, potential subjects will be evaluated to 
determine that they fulfill the entry requirements as set forth in Section 5.1. Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6.0 – Trial Flow Chart.  
Written consent for the main study must be obtained prior to performing any protocol specific procedure. Results of a test performed prior to the subject signing consent as part of routine clinical management are acceptable in lieu of a screening test if p erformed within 
the specified time frame. Screening procedures are to be completed within [ADDRESS_86764] dose of trial treatment except for the following: 
• Laboratory tests are to be performed within [ADDRESS_86765] dose of trial 
treatment.  
• For women of reproductive potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed within [ADDRESS_86766] will be required (performed by [CONTACT_79428]). 
Subjects may be rescreened after initially failing to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results from assessments performed during the initial screening period are acceptable in lieu of a repeat screening test if performed within the specified time fra me and the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria is met.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Post-Treatment Safety Follow -Up Visit  
If possible, t he Safety Follow -Up Visit should be conducted approximately [ADDRESS_86767]. All AEs that occur prior to the Safety Follow -Up Visit should be 
recorded. SAEs that occur within 30 days of the end of treatment or before initiation of a 
new anti -cancer  treatment should be followed and recorded.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow- up Visits  
Subjects who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than disease progression will move into the Follow -Up Phase and should be assessed by [CONTACT_79437]. Imaging assessments will be performed every [ADDRESS_86768] registration.

a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE  can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -specified 
procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or  protocol- specified 
procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the anakinra, is also an AE. 
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered AEs. Examples of this 
may include, but are not limited to, onset of menopause occurring at a physiologically appropriate time.  
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of anakinra in clinical trials or 
within the follow -up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, 
from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal. 
Adverse events may also occur in screened subjects during any pre -allocation baseline 
period as a result of a protocol -specified intervention, including washout or discontinuation 
of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. All AEs will be recorded from the time the consent form is signed through 30 days 
following cessation of treatment and at each examination on the AE  CRF s/worksheets. The 
reporting timeframe for AEs meeting any serious criteria is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre -screening period (for 
determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any 
protocol- specified procedure or intervention.  If the subject requires a blood dra w, fresh 
tumor biopsy etc., the subject is first required to provide consent to the main study and AEs will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting. The AE reporting 
guidelines are detailed in Table 3 below:

Attribution  - the determination of whether an adverse event is related to a medical 
treatment or procedure.  
• Definite  - the adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s).  
• Probable  - the adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent(s). 
• Possible  - the adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s).  
• Unlikely  - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s). 
• Unrelated  - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the investigational 
agent(s).  
 
The investigator (or physician designee) is  responsible for verifying and providing source 
documentation for all adverse  events and assigning the attribution for all adverse events 
for subjects enrolled. 
7.2.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose  For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed 
dose for anakinra by 20% over the prescribed dose. No specific information is available on 
the treatment of overdose of anakinra . In the event of overdose, anakinra should be 
discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. 
If an AE (s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of anakinra, the AE (s) is 
reported as a serious AE , even if no other seriousness criteria are met.  
If a dose of anakinra meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a Phase I

[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs) 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that  
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this

7.2.4 Evaluating AE s 
Severity of the adverse events (AEs) - The severity of the adverse events (AEs) will be 
graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) V.5.0.  Events not included in the NCI CTCAE will be scored as follows:  
General grading: 
• Grade 1 : Mild: discomfort present with no disruption of daily activity, no treatment 
required beyond prophylaxis. 
• Grade 2 : Moderate: discomfort present with some disruption of daily activity, 
require treatment.  
• Grade 3 : Severe: discomfort that interrupts normal daily activity, not responding 
to first line treatment.  
• Grade 4 : Life Threatening: discomfort that represents immediate risk of death   
 Any AE which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given epi[INVESTIGATOR_79400] s/worksheets.  CRS and ICANS will be assessed 
according to the AS TCT consensus guidelines  and Lee et al [ADDRESS_86774] also be evaluated for seriousness.

ciloleucel (axi -cel) treatment in patients with  relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, 
transformed FL, and high- grade BCL.  Anakinra will be tested at a dose level of 100 mg 
daily and 100 mg BID. A 3+3 design will be used for a safety run -in phase within each 
dose level of Anakinra.

 34 The study consists of two phases within each dose level cohort: 1) safety run -in phase, and 
2) expansion phase.  The maximum number of patients that will be recruited for the study 
is 20: for each dose level  cohort , according to 3+3 design, a maximum of 6 patients will be 
enrolled, and 4- 7 additional patients will be enrolled during the escalation phase, for a 
maximum of 10 patients per dose level cohort. 
8.1 Part 1: Safety Run -in Phase  
The objective of the safety run -in phase is to investigate the safety and tolerability of 
anakinra in combination with axi -cel in patients with relapsed or refractory large B -cell 
lymphoma.  
A standard 3+3 design will be employed within each dose level cohort .  Patients will be 
treated in cohorts of size 3 to 6 and the dosage will be claimed safe if the clinical toxicity 
is acceptable.   
Dose -limiting toxicity  (DLT)  is defined as the following sequenced therapy -related events  
(Sequenced therapy refers to the addition of anakinra to the approved axi -cel treatment 
regimen.) with onset within the first 28 days following the start of anakinra and 
axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion:  
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 21 days from the day of cell transfer 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting longer than 28 days from the day of cell transfer  
• Any sequenced therapy -related AE requiring intubation, including Grade [ADDRESS_86775] protection, is considered to be a DLT  
• Any sequenced therapy- related Grade 5 event   
• All other clinically significant Grade 3 toxicities lasting more than 3 days and all 
Grade 4 toxicities, with the exception of the following conditions which are not 
considered DLT’ s: 
 Encephalopathy that resolves to at worst Grade 1 within 2 weeks and to baseline within 4 weeks 
 Grade 3 fever  
 Myelosuppression (includes bleeding in the setting of platelet count < 50 x 10
9/L and documented bacterial infections in the setting of neutropenia), 
defined as lymphopenia, decreased hemoglobin, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia unless neutropenia and thrombocytopenia meet the DLT definition described above 
 Immediate hypersensitivity reactions occurring within [ADDRESS_86776] therapy 
 Renal toxicity which requires dialysis for ≤  7 days 
 Tumor lysis syndrome including associated manifestations attributable to 
tumor lysis syndrome (eg, electrolyte abnormalities, renal function, hyperuricemia 
 Grade [ADDRESS_86777] elevation  that resolve to ≤ Grade 2 within 14 days

 35  Grade 4 transient serum hepatic enzyme abnormalities that resolve to  ≤ 
Grade 3 within < 72 hours 
 Grade 3 or 4 hypogammaglobulinemia 
 Grade 3 nausea or anorexia 
If grade 3 or 4 changes in vital signs and/or neurological status are not due to CRS or 
ICANS but to one of the exceptions above, the event will not be considered a DLT. 
 The dose can be claimed  safe if  at most one out of six patients treated had DLT . The design 
scheme is as follows:

8.3 Power and population size calculation for efficacy endpoint  
In this  pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 10 patients will be enrolled and treated at the lower dose level of 
anakinra (100 mg daily).  Assuming a ICANS  rate of 70% at 30 days without the treatment 
of anakinra,18,37  a sample size of 10 will ensure the study with 84% power to detect the 
reduction to 30%  in ICANS rate  for the patients treated with anakinra with a one- sided type 
I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_86781] (nQuery Advisor 7.0).  We will estimate the ICANS  rate after the evaluation of the 10
th patient at 30 days. If deemed safe during the 
safety run -in phase, we will enroll and treat a maximum of 10 patients at the higher dose 
level (100 mg BID).  If we achieve ICANS  rate of 30% or lower) with at least one of the [ADDRESS_86782] reduction will be selected for future randomized

 37 studies.  Otherwise, we will reevaluate whether a higher dose level needs to be investigated 
for anakinra. Even if a 30% ICANS  rate is observed with the lower dose level, if deemed 
safe, the higher dose level will also be tested to explore the possibility to further reduce ICANS without any increase in toxicity. When the true ICANS rate is 70% for both doses,  
the probability of observing ICANS rate of 30% or lower for at least one dose is 
0.021.When the true ICANS rate is 30% for both doses, the probability of observing ICANS rate of 30% or lower for at least one dose is 0.877.  If a 30% or lower ICANS  
incidence rate is observed during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_79402], the study 
will be amended to include a subsequent portion, where the efficacy of anakinra will be compared to placebo in mitigating CAR-T toxicity in a randomized setting.  If none of the anakinra doses produces a 30% or lower ICANS incidence rate  during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_79403], 
then we will reevaluate whether a higher dose level needs to be investigated for anakinra.  
8.[ADDRESS_86783] 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) will be estimated.  Logistic regression may be utilized to assess the effect of patient prognostic factors on the response rate, the  ICANS rate, and CRS rate.  The distribution of 
time-to-event endpoints including progression free survival (PFS) and  overall survival 
(OS) will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier.  Time for PFS is the time interval from the start of treatment to disease progression or death due to any cause whichever happened first.  Patients would be censored at the last  follow- up date if neither 
progression nor death occurred.  Time for OS is the time interval from the start of treatment to death due to any cause.  Patients would be censored at the last follow -up date if death 
did not occur.  Comparison of time -to-event endpoints by [CONTACT_79440]- rank test.

 1.0 Clinical Investigation Plan Overview 
This preliminary, prospective, single-arm clinical  study will evaluate the safety and potential 
efficacy of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells fo r Urinary Sphincter Repair (AMDC-USR) for 
the treatment of male stress urinary incontinence (S UI) that develops following prostate surgery.  
 
Prostate surgery can induce iatrogenic sphincter damage resulting in long-term SUI. Therefore, 
augmenting sphincter function may be beneficial  to patients. Autologous  muscle cell therapy, 
which involves isolation of cells from skelet al muscle biopsies, ex vivo expansion, and 
subsequent injection into the ur ethral sphincter, may serve as a potential durable therapy. In 
animal studies, muscle derived cells have succe ssfully integrated within tissue to improve 
sphincter function. Intrasphincteric injection of  AMDC-USR is expected to produce localized 
tissue changes near the injection site and is  not expected to produce a systemic effect. 
 Patients will receive intras phincteric injection of a single treatment of [ADDRESS_476422]  muscle tissue harvested using a needle biopsy 
technique during an outpatient procedure. The harvested muscle tissue will be placed in a hypothermic medium and transported to the manuf acturer for cell processi ng in their laboratory 
in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA ([LOCATION_003]). The muscle derived cells (MDC) will be isol ated and expanded in 
culture over several weeks to a final dose of 150 x 10
6 ± 20% AMDC-USR.  
 Due to the personalized nature of each autologous product, some products may not meet all 
Cook MyoSite, Incorporated  Version: 13-11-03 
  
AMDC-USR for Male SUI IND Clinical Trial  Version Da te: [ADDRESS_476423] may be offered to the patient at the phy sician’s discretion. Affected patients will be 
notified prior to their injecti on procedure and must provide c onsent of their willingness to 
receive an injection of product that does not meet all target criteria. 
 
After reaching the desired concen tration, the isolated and expa nded AMDC-USR will be frozen 
and shipped back to the investigating physic ian. The physician will thaw the AMDC-USR and 
dilute the sample with an approximately equal volume of physiological  saline. Under direct 
vision, the resulting suspension will be injected into the patient’s urethral  sphincter in a brief 
outpatient procedure.  Patients will be assessed for safety and impr ovement in urinary incontinence symptoms at 
1, 3, [ADDRESS_476424]-re lated serious adverse 
events (SAEs) and the incidence of study product-related, biopsy procedure-related, and injection procedure-related a dverse events and post-void re sidual (PVR) urine volume. 
Secondarily, potential efficacy will be evaluate d based on reduction in the amount of urine 
leakage, as assessed by a 24-hour pad test at 1, 3, 6, and 12 mont hs following treatment. Changes 
in patient-reported incontinence symptom seve rity, quality of life (QOL), and erectile 
dysfunction (ED) symptoms will also be assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following treatment.

Muscle Biopsy 
 The biopsy procedure will involve minor surger y to collect approximately 50-[ADDRESS_476430] of 
care for outpatient surgery procedures. Antianxiet y medication, analgesia, or minimal sedation 
may be provided according to each site’s standard of care.  
 
 Several passes of the biopsy needle may be requi red to obtain a satisfactory sample of muscle 
tissue. Additionally, if the first biopsy does not produce an adequate sample for product 
isolation, it may be necessary for the patient to return for another biopsy procedure. The 
maximum permissible number of biopsy needle passes and the total number of biopsies is contingent upon patient tolerance and the sa tisfactory procurement of muscle tissue.  
 Using aseptic technique, the biopsy tissue will be  transferred to the Biopsy Medium Vial. The 
Biopsy Medium Vial will be closed and packag ed according to the study procedure guidelines 
for shipment to Cook MyoSite, Incorporated.  Dilution and Preparation for Injection 
 The frozen product will be thawed for at least 8- 10 minutes at room temperature. The 2 mL of 
cell suspension will be diluted with  2 mL of physiological saline fo r an approximate total volume 
of 4 mL. The entire vial contents  will be used for injection. 
 Cell Injection 
 The study agent (AMDC-USR) will be injected into the urethral sphincter. A course of prophylactic antibiotics will be given prior to the injec tion procedure. Ultrasound may be 
performed to aid in the injection procedure. Under direct vision, multiple injections will be

sphincter. Materials contact[CONTACT_380434]’s own AMDC-USR, 
the cryogenic medium in which the AMDC -USR are suspended and shipped, and the 
physiological saline used to dilu te the mixture for injection. Prio r to the injection, patients who 
are currently taking any form of  anticoagulant medication must stop using the medication as per 
standard of care for outpatient surgery procedur es. Antianxiety medication, analgesia, or minimal 
sedation may be provided according to each site’s standard of care or physician’s discretion. 
 
After the injection is completed, the injected area  will be examined for any excessive bleeding or 
excessive trauma. The patient will be asked to  void, and an ultrasound/bladder scan will be 
performed to determine PVR urine volume.

 Page 20 of 41 
  Study product-related, biopsy pr ocedure-related, and injectio n procedure-related adverse 
events reported through 24-month follow-up; and 
 PVR urine volume reported through 12-month follow-up. 
6.3.2 Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary endpoints include:  
 
 Reduction in amount of urine leakage, as assessed by 24-hour pad test at 1, 3, [ADDRESS_476442]-treatment;  
 Change in patient-reported incontinence symp tom severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_380438] 1, 3, [ADDRESS_476443]-treatment; and 
 Change in patient-reported QOL, as assesse d by [CONTACT_380439] 1, 3, [ADDRESS_476444]- and study 
procedure-related adverse events. Additionall y, PVR volume will be assessed throughout the 
study to monitor potential re tention or obstruction.   
 
Efficacy measurements will be used in this study to assess the severity level of an individual’s incontinence symptoms and the extent to which incontinence symptoms impair quality of life. 
Measures to assess incontinence include a 24-ho ur pad test, the International Consultation on 
Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ),
8,9 the Incontinence Quality of Life (IQOL) questionnaire,9,10 
the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S),11,12 the Patient Global Impression of 
Improvement (PGI-I),11,12 and the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS).13,14 
 Since SUI and ED can be comorbidities that de velop following prostate  surgery, the 5-Item 
International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5)
15 questionnaire will be used to monitor 
symptoms of ED.

test. Patients will be instructed on how to perfor m the 24-hour pad test (please refer to Appendix 
B for the Instructions for the 24-Hour Pad Test ) and will be provided with sufficient preweighed 
pads to complete the test. The completed 24-hour pad test must be returned before or at the next 
scheduled screening visit. A PVR urine volume will be measured with ultrasound/bladder scan. 
Patients will complete the following questionnai res: ICIQ, IQOL, PGI-S, I-PSS, and IIEF-5. 
Blood samples will be collected to assess for PSA levels, bloodborne pathogens, hematocrit, 
hemoglobin, WBC count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)  or urea, and creatinine.  Patients will 
undergo cystoscopy for evaluation of the appearance of urethral and bladder tissue. An existing 
cystoscopy evaluation can be used if performed within  [ADDRESS_476451] invasive.

 8.0  Statistical Considerations 
8.1 Hypothesis to be Tested 
This is a preliminary, prospective, single-arm study to assess the safety of AMDC-USR in males 
with SUI. The study is not powered statistically for any measurable outcomes. 
8.2 Sample Size 
The study will treat up to 30 patients at up to 5 clin ical sites. Because this is a preliminary study, 
no formal statistical determination of sample size was performed. 
8.3 General Analysis Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS
® for Windows® (release 9.3 or higher) or other 
widely accepted statistical softwa re. Continuous variables will be reported as means and standard 
deviations unless otherwise noted. Categorical vari ables will be reported as  percents. Ninety-five 
percent (95%) confidence intervals for all endpoint variables will be presented. Survival analysis 
techniques such as Kaplan-Mei er or Cox Proportional Hazards ma y be incorporated if censoring 
of data occurs. 
8.4 Missing Data 
Missing data may be addressed using complete case analysis or multiple imputation. 
8.5 Limitations of the Study 
This preliminary study with a small sample size may limit the ability to generalize results to a 
larger population. The sample size is insufficien t to allow definitive statements regarding 
efficacy. Patients will serve as their own controls  with quantitative and qu alitative measures of 
incontinence assessed before treatment and compared  to the same measures at various times after 
treatment.

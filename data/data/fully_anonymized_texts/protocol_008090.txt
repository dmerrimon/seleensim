LMR – MotionSense Clinical Use Evaluation - Protocol |  Rev. [ADDRESS_325773] been performed to inform the design of the Motionsense wearable 
hardware and mobile application  (Figure 1). This wearable system will seek  FDA Class I status (see 
Appendix F1- 4) and allows evaluating the knee flexion angle during activities of daily living and during 
physiotherapy , while also tracking secondary metrics (often derived from the knee flexion) . This 
system consists of two sensor  nodes that are placed above and below the knee joint respectively. This 
is achieved by [CONTACT_267602], whereby [CONTACT_267603]’ skin and intended to stay on for at least a week. Subsequently, the daily  patches connect the 
sensor nodes to these weekly patches. The sensor nodes shall thus be removed daily as they require daily (overnight) charging. A detailed description of the system is provided in Appendix A.  
 
Figure 1 – Schematic design of the Motionsense system consisting of sensor nodes (left), daily and 
weekly patches (middle) and mobile application (right).  
  
The data collected through the wearable and mobile app are shared with a cloud infrastructure, 
hereafter referred to as OrthoLogIQ. This is a HIPAA compliant database infrastructure that provides the surgeon and care team with remote access to the patient profile to review the daily activity data, 
assigned home exercise program and compliance therewith, pi[INVESTIGATOR_267592], …  
 
A primary outcome from these wearable devices is the knee range of motion, absolute knee flexion 
angle, knee active time, steps  and successful repetitions of prescribed physiotherapy exercises. These 
metrics are tracked and reported by [CONTACT_267604].  
 
During the proposed study, the MotionSense wearable system will be used by [CONTACT_267605] . The patients will be using the system to monitor their 
recovery during daily activities, log daily pain scores and patient reported outcomes while also 
supporting their prescribed home exercise program. Each patient will thereby [CONTACT_267606], while the physiotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_267593]-

patients recovery remotely as the sensor / app data is shared to the OrthoLogIQ platform.   
 The primary goal of this observational study is to evaluate the usability of t he Motionsense system in 
a typi[INVESTIGATOR_267594], while also documenting the physiotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ decisions in advancing 
patients’ home exercise program .

- Quad isometrics  
- Short arc quads  
- Long arc quads  
- Straight leg raises

exercis es that are outside of the abovementioned library be indicated for the individual patient, these 
exercises will be documented in the PT journal and assigned to the individual patient through the current standard of care.

Page 9 of 12 3.6 Materials  
For the duration of the study, the patient will be provided with:  
- Weekly patches:  these weekly patches go directly on the knee. Initially the patient will be 
provided with [ADDRESS_325780] more weekly patches can be obtained through 
the surgeon clinic.  
- Daily patches: the daily patches are used to connect the sensors to the weekly patches and shall 
be replaced every time the sensors come off the leg. Initially the patient will be provided with 6 3 
x 2 daily patches though refill packs can be provided through the surgeon clinic should the patient run out of patches.  
- Box: including two sensor nodes, a charger with power cord, instructions for use and a sensor 
alignment block  
 The accompanying MotionSense mobile application will be available for download through the app 
store. The patient will be assisted with this installation process by [CONTACT_267617].  
3.7 Participants  
The study participant will represent a range of typi[INVESTIGATOR_267598] . More 
specifically, the following selection criteria will be used :

- Age 50 to 80 
- BMI not exceeding 35  
- Owns a smartphone (agnostic to brand or type)  
- Patient does not have severe skin conditions that would potentially result in irritation or harming the skin when applying the weekly patches.  
 Beyond that, the study should aim to recruit patients with various socio- economic backgrounds, 
various levels of motivation as well as a wide range of educational level.

Page 10 of 12 3.8 Data Collection  
 
In general, the data collection in this study is focused on assessing the primary and secondary goals of the study  as listed in section 2.0 . This leads to various sources of data collection:  
- Patient journal:  pre-operatively, the patient will fill out a number of  questionnaires on paper 
form to frame potential comorbidities / socio- economic status / expectations.  
- Physiotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_267599] : the physiotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_267600] a document following each 
physiotherapy visit to document the prescribed exercises along with  the motivation for assigning 
these exercises and setting the targets for these exercises .   
- Wearable & App data capture: during the patients’ daily use of the wearable and interaction 
with the mobile application, the sensor will capture activities of the patients’ daily life as well as their exercise completion  by [CONTACT_267619] a series of variables on the patient’s phone and sharing this 
data to a HIPAA compliant database . More specifically, this data capture involves: 
 ADL: the patients ’ activities of daily liv ing is captured by [CONTACT_267620], involving an hourly 
histogram of the patients knee flexion angle, an hourly total of a patients’ active minutes, an hourly total of a patients’ weight bearing time, an hourly total of a patients’ time wearing the 
sensor.  
 Gait: at predefined time intervals (2 x per week), the patient will be prompted to walk for 1 
minute while the sensors log the raw signals and share this data with the OrthoLogIQ database. This data can be further evaluated from cloud, looking at cadence, range of motion during 
gait, …  
 Exercises: the performed exercises and completion of the daily exercises will be recorded by 
[CONTACT_132556].  
 Pain scores: the patient will be asked to report their daily  pain scores through the mobile 
application.  
 Patient Reported Outcomes: patients will be asked to complete a K OOS and PROMIS -[ADDRESS_325782].  
- Patient interviews  
 At the end of the  study, the patient will join a  phone  interview while  responding to a series of 
usability questions specific to their use of MotionSense during the recovery after surgery. In 
addition, the patient will be asked about any complications and/or re -admissions that they 
experienced during their 90d recovery window after surgery .

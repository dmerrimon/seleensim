A3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY PROTOCOL  ................................ ................................ ..............................  [ADDRESS_504139]  
 
About 1.3 million Americans aged 40 and older are legally blind, a majority 
because of diseases with onset later in life, such as glaucoma and age- related 
macular degeneration [1]. Second Sight has developed the world’s first FDA 
approved r etinal implant, Argus II, intended to restore some functional vision for 
people suffering from retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802] (RP).  
 The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System developed by [CONTACT_400003] a medical device regulated by [CONTACT_1622]’s Humanitarian Device Exemption H110002.  The 
Argus II system comprises three sub- system components: the internal Implant, the 
external Video Processing Unit (VPU) and Glasses, and the supporting Clinical 
Fitting System.  
 In this era of smart devices, generic navigation technology, s uch as GPS mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399988], can provide directions to help guide a blind user from point A to point B. However, these navigational aids do little to enable blind users to form an egocentric understanding of their  surroundings, they are not sui ted to navigation 
indoors, and do nothing to assist in avoiding obstacles to mobility. The Argus II, on the other hand, provides blind users with a form of artificial vision that provides limited visual representation of their surroundings that improves a user’s ability to 
orient themselves and traverse obstacles, yet the user’s vision remains significantly limited by [CONTACT_400004][INVESTIGATOR_399986]  2023 
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 4 is thus limited in its ability to provide high- level navigation and semantic 
interpretation of the surroundings. The proposed study aims to address these 
limitations of the Argus II through a synergy of artificial vision and state -of-the-art 
simultaneous localization and mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (SLAM) and object  recognition 
technologies.  
 Users of the Argus II device will participate in the study while using their Argus II device according to its intended use. Other non- medical devices that will be used 
as part of this study include the following (see Section D3): 
• Headphones for receiving auditory information about the environment;  
• Vibrotactile stimulator to perceive, through vibrations on a participant’s skin, 
information about the environment;  
• Virtual reality headset (used only by [CONTACT_13541] -sighted participants in order to 
simulate the visual experience of a prosthetic vision user)  
• Portable central processing unit to integrate all environmental information 
and relay the infor mation in informative ways back to the user using the 
various forms of sensory feedback, including the Argus II system or a head 
mounted display  (HMD) , the headphones, and a vibrotactile stimulator.  
 This study is driven by [CONTACT_400005] , 
stereo/depth based and object recognition technologies  conveying spatial 
environmental information via a combination of artificial vision and auditory  and/or 
haptic  feedback. SLAM enables the visual prosthesis system to construct a map 
of the user’s environment and locate the user within that map. Ultimately, we 
expect that this technology will allow users to create an effective spatial image of the environment , that is, a continuously updated representation of locations in 3D 
space that supports volitional action for independent navigation with minimal cognitive load.  
A2 Purpose of the Study Protocol  
 This is a prospective observational case series study. We will develop and test  a 
navigational aid system which 1) constructs a map of  unfamiliar environments and 
localizes the user in that environment using SLAM technology 2) automatically identifies navigationally -relevant objects and landmarks in that environment using 
object recognition and 3) provides sensory feedback via multiple modalities for 
navigation, obstacle avoidance, and object/landmark identification.  
 We will test the system ’s potential  with both Argus II users  and with normall y 
sighted participants (by [CONTACT_400006] a retinal prosthesis via a head- mounted display  
that emulates the capabilities of the Argus II device) .  
 The human subject tests fall into three groups: in Group 1, target identification and 
localization tasks  test the basic capabilities of the system for conveying 
characteristics (e.g. shapes, sizes, movement direction) and location information 
Environmental Localization Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399986]  2023 
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 5 about objects that would be targets for navigation or action.  In this group, 
participants will be stationary and only be as ked to rotate/pan their head to acquire 
camera- generated targets.  In Group 2,  egocentric localization and spatial image 
updating tasks test how well the system provides spatial parameters, particularly 
distance, from optical flow and non- visual sources, leading to the formation of the 
spatial image. Finally, Group [ADDRESS_504140] identities.  The features to be utilized will be determined after tests in Group 
1, but the general goal is to add spatial and/or  temporal uniqueness without 
cluttering the display.  The third system, the Augmented + Modal  system , adds 
non-visual cues.  Initially, we are targeting two non-visual au gmentation modalities 
including  (i) verbal and non- verbal auditory feedback  along with spatial sound for 
purposes such as  to convey the identity , distance, and direction of objects relative 
the user and ( ii) haptic feedback for purposes such as to direct u sers how to adjust 
their head azimuth and elevation in order to acquire a landmark or waypoint within their field of view . 
 
The enhanced imagery information for visual feedback used in the Augmented 
and Augmented + Modal modes of the system will be computed by [CONTACT_400007] a built -in 
video input on the Argus II that enables visual information provided from an external source to be displayed by [CONTACT_28024] ’s implant. No alterations, including  
software or hardware changes, will be made to a participant’s Argus II system during this study.  
 
B Background  
B1 Prior Literature and Studies  
 
The Argus II system is a fully portable medical device approved by [CONTACT_400008] (HDE) program. It consists of implanted and external components  (see Figure
 1). 
Environmental Localization Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399986]  2023 
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 6 The implant is an epi[INVESTIGATOR_399989] a 
receiver, electronics, and an electrode array that are surgically implanted in and around the eye. The array has 60 electrodes arranged in a 10x6 rectangular grid  
[2], [3] . It is attached to the retina over the macula with 
a retinal tack. The external equipment includes glasses, a video processing unit (VPU) and a cable. The glasses include a miniature video camera, which 
captures video images, and a coil that transmits data and stimulation commands to the implant. The VPU converts the video images into stimulation commands and is body -worn. The cable connects the glasses to 
the VPU. The Arg us II system operates by [CONTACT_400009], delivering the signal through the optic 
nerve to the brain where it is perceived as light.   
 Retinal implant technologies are just emerging, and the Argus II currently serves as a complementary device to the long cane and guide dog for complex tasks, such as O&M. Due to the low resolution and highly limited field of view of the retinal implant, vi sual prosthesis users  must use continuous head scanning, both 
horizontal and vertical, to observe the visual field of normal human  vision. This skill 
has been trained and demonstrated in previous studies  [4], [5] which were based 
on “radar vision”  [6], a scheme using head scanning to locate a high- contrast object 
in an uncluttered background.  
 Our proposed efforts focus on technology that  will help develop the Argus II, and 
other prosthetic vision devices, into stand- alone aids capable of enabling people  
with profound vision loss to regain their independence, just as cochlear implants developed from lip- reading aids  into fully functional devices capable of restoring 
speech understanding in as little as two decades [7] . 
B2 Rationale for this Study  
 To enhance the Argus II capabilities, we will be adding recognition- enabled 
navigational technologies for these visual prosthesis users. This will consist in delivering enhanced visual cues optimized for user recognition and to provide auditory / verbal cues as well as haptic information through vibrotactile stimulators.  
 We will recruit approximately  [ADDRESS_504141]. We do not claim that  Argus II users will be comparable 
in performance; in fact, testing will be directed at the implanted users to  
characterize a range of performance compared to baseline.

 7 Our Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) , Johns 
Hopkins Medicine Wilmer Eye Institute (JHM/Wilmer), and Second Sight  teams 
have been collaborating for the past several years to advance the capabilities of 
the Ar gus II system and improve performance of Argus II recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], including 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_399990], and have extensive 
experience in designing and developi[INVESTIGATOR_399991]. In addition to the investigators at  Wilmer Eye Institute and Second 
Sight who have extensive experience in working with retinal prosthesis users, our team includes [CONTACT_400048], who has a long history of research working with visually impaired individual s and studying the impact of human neurophysiology 
and psychology on the design of instruments and devices that can be used as navigational aids for the blind.  
 
C Study Objectives  
C1 Primary Aim  
 
The primary aim of this study is to ascertain whether our system allows Argus II recipi[INVESTIGATOR_399992] a “spatial image” of their environment, that is, a continuously updated 
representation of locations in three dimensional space that supports volitional action for 
independent navigation.  
C2 Rationale for the Selection of Outcome Measures  
 The outcome measures derive directly from the goals of this study, namely the ability to 
identify and localize targets, with and without movements, and navigate through a field 
comprised of these targets.  
 
D Study Design  
D1 Overview  or Design Summary  
 
Testing will be conducted at JHU /APL, JHM/Wilmer  and at  JHU Homewood 
campus . 
 
This study will be conducted with three different sets of participants.   
• One set of eligible participants will consist of Argus II users , with a  total of 
approximately [ADDRESS_504142] sites.  
• A separate set of  eligible participants will consist of normally sighted 
individuals from JHU/APL’s staff of over 7, 000. To simulate the visual 
perception of  the Argus II users, these participants will be equipped with a 
head- mounted display , such as an Oculus Rift , that simulates the field of 
Environmental Localization Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399986]  [ADDRESS_504143] at JHU/APL.  
• Another set of eligible participants will consist of normally sighted individuals 
from interested students and staff from JHU Homewood campus. Similar to 
the JHU/APL study group, these participants will be equipped with a head-
mounted display that simulates the field of view and pi[INVESTIGATOR_399993] . A total of approximately [ADDRESS_504144] at JHU  Homewood campus , but could utilize JHU/APL campus if 
needed.  
 For information regarding recruitment and informed consent for these participant groups, refer to Section D2 .b. 
 The study itself will consist of  two phases  which are expected to be conducted over 
the course of 1- 5 testing days (longer for Argus II users, due to setup time 
requirements, shorter for normally sighted subjects) . In the first phase (Group 1 
and Group 2 tasks, see Section A2  and below ), subjects will be trained to identify 
and localize objects within an unfamiliar environment  by [CONTACT_400010] a visual prosthesis . These tests will be conducted to 
assess the capabilities of the system for conveying identity and location 
information about objects that could be targets for navigation or action. Compared with the Basic system , we will then assess how well the augmented system s 
(Augmented and Augmented + Modal systems, refer to Section A2 ) function in 
providing  spatial parameters, particularly distance, using visual  but also non- visual 
sources  of information including haptic/vibrotactile and auditory feedback . 
 The identification and localization tests  (Group 1)  use common psychophysical 
judgments such as the following: discriminating between two alternatives by [CONTACT_400011], touching a tablet  computer to indicate the  
apparent  location of a target  in the frontal plane, and looking for targets by [CONTACT_400012]. In t he egocentric localization and spatial 
updating tasks (Group 2) , the participants will make similar psychophysical 
judgments, but now in the context of movement, for example requiring the 
participant s to walk several meters towards a visible  target . For example, i n some 
trials  participants may be asked to move  backwards  to the origin (with aid of a 
guide) , then verbally estimate the distance to the target or point with a joystick 
toward it . Similarly, in other trials, after walking toward the target with vision 
present , they may be asked to move forward a short distance without vision and 
make the sam e types of judgments.   
 The second phase of testing (Group 3 tasks ), will involve using the information 
gleaned from the first phase to assess participants’ ability to navigate through an  
unfamiliar  environment . This phase will again compare user performance using the 
Environmental Localization Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399986]  2023 
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 9 Basic system  with user performance using the Augmented and Augmented + 
Modal  systems where contextual information associated with the task  is conveyed 
to users via enhanced visual, auditory , and haptic modalities.  
 
Our algorithms for mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399994]. As the user traverses their environment, object recognition will be used in concert with the spatia l 
localization and mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399995] (e.g., doors, signs, etc.) and store these locations in the map. Once stored in the map, these semantic attributes may then be verbally queried by [CONTACT_400013], e.g., “lead me to the nearest restroom”.  
 The enhanced imagery  generated by [CONTACT_400014] + Modal  
systems will be achieved without modifying the Argus II device. The i magery 
content  for these modes will be computed by [CONTACT_400015] . 
 
 
Figure [ADDRESS_504145] recognition during algorithm testing and stored in the system’s map of the 
environment. The path to the door is impeded by a couch, which is also stored in the map as an obstacle labeled by [CONTACT_400016]. Upon receiving the user request, the system computes a path around the couch to the door and initiates navigational cues to guide the user along the planned path. As the user progresses along this path, the door is enhanced (brightened) in artificial vision as being the 
target destination. Nearby [CONTACT_400017] (such as the couch) are also shown through 
the prosthesis (or the simulated prosthesis for normally sighted participants) , while 
the system’s stereo- vision -based obstacle detection feature continually monitors 
the scene for both mapped and previously undetected obstacles along the way.  
 In additi on to the navigation itself, participants will provide numerical ratings on 
scales to indicate the mental (cognitive) load of the task, perceived effort, and ease of travel.  Participants will also provide qualitative answers to questions pertaining 
to thei r experience using the system, such as what elements of the system were 
more or less helpful and how they believe the system could be improved.  
 During the consent process, participants will be given the opportunity to consent to audio- video recordings being taken of them while performing the tasks of this 
study.  Consenting to audio- video recording is not mandatory for subjects to 
participate in t he study.  For those participants who consent to audio- video 
recording,  the recordings may be used to help analyze the participant’s  
performance in the study and may be used in presentations of the methods and 
outcomes of the study  before a general audience.   Audio- video recordings will not 
be used for advertising or non- study related purposes.

D2 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
2.a Inclusion Criteria  
 
Criteria for inclusion of normally sighted individuals:  
• Subject speaks English;  
• Subject is an adult ( at least 18 years of age) ; 
• Subject has the cognitive and communication ability to participate in the 
study (i.e., follow spoken directions, perform tests, and give feedback);  
• Subject is willing to conduct psychophysics testing up to 4 -6 hours per day 
of testing on 3- 5 consecutive days;  
• Subject has visual acuity of 20/ 40 or better  (corrected) ; 
• Subject is capable of understanding participant information materials and 
giving written informed consent.  
• Subject is able to walk unassisted 
 Criteria for inclusion of Argus II users:  
The inclusion criteria for the study are the following:  
• Subject is at least 25 years of age;  
• Subject has been implanted with the Argus II system;  
• Subject’s eye has healed from surgery and the surgeon has cleared the 
subject for programming;  
• Subject has the cognitive and communication ability to participate in the 
study (i.e., follow spoken directions, perform tests, and give feedback);  
• Subject is willing to conduct psychophysics testing up to 4- 6 hours per day 
of testing on 3- 5 consecutive days;  

Environmental Localization Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399986]  2023 
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 11 • Subject is capable of understanding patient information materials and giving 
written informed consent ; 
• Subject is able to walk unassisted (for participation in mobility tasks) . 
 The aim for the normally sighted group is t o avoid any visual acuity issues that 
could impact the participant’s performance in the study . Therefore, we require a 
visual acuity of 20/40 or better with correction, which is  sufficient to perceive the 
low-resolution visual feedback that will be displayed to sighted users using the VR 
headset . We also require sighted participants to be adults, as experiments with 
this group simulate a medical device that is used by [CONTACT_400019] . For the Argus II 
group, t he minimum FDA- approved age for use of the Argus II device is 25. We do 
not require  a maximum age limit for this study group, but do require that 
participants are able to walk unassisted for participation in mobility tasks. Participants in the Argus II group who are not able to walk unassisted may still 
participate in non- mobility tasks, such as stationary tasks that evaluate the 
participant ’s ability to perceive and understand various forms of visual feedback 
provided to their retinal implant.  
2.a Exclusion Criteria  
 
Exclusion criteria for all subjects is the following:  
• Subject is unwilling or unable to travel to testing facility for at least 3 days of testing within a one- week timeframe;
 
• Subject does not speak English;  
• Subject has language or hearing impairment.  
 
The requirement that subjects speak English and do not have a language or 
hearing impairment  is due to the fact that this study involves use of a voice- enabled 
navigational aid that subjects will interact with via a speech interface both to control 
the system and to receiv e specific forms of information feedback from the system 
regarding the subjects’ surroundings. The voice- enabled device leverages 
autonomous speech recognition and speech synthesis capabilities with support  for 
only the English language. Therefore, it is required for subjects to both speak and 
hear English in order to fully utilize the capabilities of the navigational aid being 
developed for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] ; however , future accommodations may be made for 
non-English speakers  or hearing impairments . 
 
2.b Subject Recruitment Plans and Consent Process 
 
As described in Section D1 , this study will be conducted with t hree different sets 
of participants.   
• The Argus II user group of participants will be recruited from Argus II users 
who have given their consent to be reached for human subject tests in previous non- significant risk studies. S ubjects will learn about the study via 
phone call from a member of our study team . 
Environmental Localization Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399986]  2023 
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 12 • A normally sighted group of participants will be recruited from JHU/APL’s 
staff of over 7,000. Interested candidates will be informed of the study 
through IRB -approved lab- wide human subject testing email distributions.  
Interested candidates will contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238], if they meet 
inclusion /exclusion  criteria, they will coordinate a time with the study team 
that would allow for experiments to take place.  
• Another normally sighte d group of participants will be recruited from JHU  
Homewood’s students and staff. For this group of JHU Homewood 
participants, all direct recruitment will be conducted only by [CONTACT_400020], a member of the study team who is both a full -time staff member of 
APL and a graduate student within the Whiting School of Engineering and who is not involved in the academic supervision of students at JHU Homewood. This recruitment by [CONTACT_400021]- of-mouth and/or through IRB -approved human subje ct testing 
email distributions. I nterested candidates will contact [CONTACT_400022], if they meet the inclusion /exclusion  criteria, they will coordinate 
a time with the study team that would allow for experiments to take place.  
Prior to beginning the study, the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_399996], 
will walk each interested candidate through the consent form, providing additional details about the study, and if a candidate is still interested, consents and has time, they  will be able to begin the first testing day immediately after providing 
informed consent. Study participant s are also free to leave the study at any time.  
 
2.c Risks and Benefits 
 This is a non- significant risk study in which no medical procedures will be 
performed. It is not a treatment , and it has no impact on healthcare or health itself. 
There will be no exchange of information with physicians.  
 Elements of minimal risk are described herein. We divide the risks into three groups: common to all participants,  Argus II users only, and normally sighted users 
only.  
 As described in Section D1 , the tasks associated with this study require a 
participant to walk slowly or stand in place while making simple judgments such as 
pointing to a target in space, judging distance, and discrimi nating identities or 
direction of motion of target objects.  
 Risks f or All Participants:  
Navigating through an unfamiliar environment with limited visibility (delivered through the HMD for normally sighted participants) involves a risk of trippi[INVESTIGATOR_399997]. Our team has 
worked in this kind of testing and to- date this risk has never materialized.  This is 
due to a combination of ensuring the participants understand the requirement to 
Environmental Localization Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399986]  [ADDRESS_504146] of eligibility data, user-specific configuration settings for the Argus II device, sensor data 
required to create maps of the testing environment, and behavioral data (includes video).  As a result, there is a risk of breach of confidentiality . This is mitigated by 
[CONTACT_400023] .  
 Risks for Argus II U sers:  
For Argus II users there are no risks associated with using the Argus II device that 
are greater than the risks that  participants face using their Argus II device in their 
everyday liv es. In accordance with the device’s Safety and Probable benefit 
document ( https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf11/H110002B.pdf)
, the 
following precautions will be followed:  
• In the event of any undesirable sensation when using the device, all 
operations will be halted, and Argus II glasses will be removed or the 
Argus II Visual Processing Unit (VPU) will be turned off.  
• Argus II user s will only use a VPU that has been specifically 
programmed for them by [CONTACT_400024].  
• Argus II users will continue to use their other mobility aides, such as a 
cane, at all times.  
 
Risks for JHU/APL Participants : 
Normally sight ed study participants at JHU/APL will be asked to don a head 
mounted display for extensive periods of time. In addition to the common risks mentioned above, there is a risk of dizziness and fatigue  caused by [CONTACT_400025]. As above, this risk is  mitigated by [CONTACT_400026][INVESTIGATOR_399986]  [ADDRESS_504147] as well as interrupting testing and potentially resuming on a 
different day if requested by a participant. Here too, participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time.  
 
Benefits:  
Potential benefits that individual participants may experience from taking part in this research stems from the new sensory information afforded to prosthetic vision 
users by [CONTACT_400027] , as 
well as the addition of haptic and auditory sensory feedback to supplement 
prosthetic vision. This may help current and future prosthetic vision users to 
independently form mental maps of their surroundings using their prosthetic vision  
device and allow users to gain confidence in using the device for navigating new 
environments .  
2.d Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
 
In all cases, expected time commitments will be clearly communicated to participants ahead of time. It will also be clearly communicated to participants that 
they may choose to withdraw from the research at any time for any reason.  
2.e When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
 
Subjects will be withdrawn early from the study anytime upon subject request. It is also 
possible that other factors may contribute to the need for early withdrawal. For 
example, a malfunction of the system may cause us to have to stop testing. No 
special procedures are associated with withdrawing a subject early from this study other than to discontinue testing. Participants will be compensated for their time spent participating in the study prior to early withdrawal as described in Section I3 . 
2.f Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
 
In case of early withdrawal, no further data gathering nor  follow -up will be conducted  with 
the subject s.  As for all subjects, if a subject consents to be contact[CONTACT_60735], they may be contact[CONTACT_400028] . 
D3 Study Device  
3.a Description  
 
The following devices are used in this study . No device will be used with any study 
participant prior to being reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_243015]’ clinical 
engineering services (CES).  
• Argus II Retinal Prosthesis Sys tem: used in this study by [CONTACT_400029] a pre- existing implanted retinal prosthesis . This is an FDA 
approved device and will be used according to its intended use.  
Environmental Localization Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399986]  2023 
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 15 • Head Mounted Display: used in this  study by [CONTACT_400030]. For this device we will use a virtual reality headset, such as the 
Oculus Quest or HTC Vive or equivalent . Use of this device in the study 
will require review and approval by [CONTACT_400031] (CES) prior to being used in the study.  
• Embedded Processing Platform and Sensors: an embedded processing 
platform will be used to process information acquired by  [CONTACT_400032]. Imagery  displayed to user s will be computed by [CONTACT_400033] . For Argus II users, the computed images will be transmitted to 
the Argus II system for display via the retinal prosthesis, whereas, for 
sighted users, the computed images will be transmitted to the HMD device. The embedded processing platform and associated sensors will be battery powered. The system  will be  carrie d by [CONTACT_400034] a beltpack 
or other suitable means of mobility, along with head gear for carrying the head- mounted sensors . This system will incorporate various sensors 
such as an RGB  camera, depth sensor,  and inertial measurement unit 
(IMU) for sensing objects and tracking the environment. Example 
environmental sensors that may be used include the Intel RealSense 
Depth Camera D435i and Intel RealSense LiDAR  Camera L515 or 
similar . Use of the embedded platform and sensors will require review 
and approval by [CONTACT_400035] (CES) 
prior to being used in the study.  
• Wearable H aptic Device:  used in this  study to augment sensory 
feedback delivered back to the user , such as to guide the user in a  
direction to turn their head in order t o visually locate an object of interest. 
This device will be battery -powered and designed to be worn and used 
by a human with insignificant risk. Specifically , we will embed haptic 
actuators (such as the Zorb vibrotactile actuators from Somatic Labs) 
within a body -worn  device that when donned provides localized haptic 
feedback  to signify directionality . For example, a neckband device may 
provide localized vibra tion points behind the neck, over each shoulder, 
and in front of the chest, with each vibration point signifying one of the four cardinal look directions (up, down, left, and right). This device will 
also require review and approval by [CONTACT_400036] (CES) prior to being used in the study.  
• Wearable Audio Device: used in the study to augment  sensory feedback  
delivered back to the user  by [CONTACT_400037]/or audible tones to 
communicate, such as communicating the identity or locati ons of objects 
in the scene or communicating which direction to turn in order to 
advance towar ds a destination. For this devic e we will use either 
conventional or bone- conduction headphones such as the Aeropex from 
Aftershokz or equivalent or other form of  wearable speakers such as the 
neck -worn Soundwear Companion from Bose or equivalent . This device 
Environmental Localization Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399986]  2023 
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 16 will also require review and approval by [CONTACT_400038] (CES) prior to being used in the study.  
3.b Treatment Regimen  
 The Argus II device will be used in accordance with its intended use.  All other 
devices will require IRB CES approval for use in human testing.  
 
E Study Procedures  
E1 Screening for Eligibility  
 As described in S ection D2.b, subjects will be recruited from normally sighted 
populations at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory  and JHU 
Homewood campus  as well as from lists of users of the Argus I I device who have 
participated in prior studies associated with their device and who have granted consent to be contact[CONTACT_7678] . As long as interested candidates meet 
the inclusion criteria and are not rejected by [CONTACT_400039] w ill be 
eligible to participate in this study.  
E2 Schedule of Measurements  
 Testing is expected to be conducted over a [ADDRESS_504148] current version of the study protocol.  
Both the PI ([CONTACT_400049]) and the site -PI’s at each study location will be responsible for 
monitoring participant safety, evaluating the progress of the study, reviewing procedures 
for maintaining the confidentiality of data, the quality of data collection, management, and 
analyses, in accordance with guidance provided by [CONTACT_60683].  In case of protocol 
events or deviations at participating sites, any team member aware of the issue will 
promptly notify the PI ([CONTACT_400049])  and site-PI, and a report will be promptly submitted to 
the IRB  (and sponsoring agency if appropriate)  per the JHM IRB’s prompt reporting 
requirements , as described further below. 
 
The research data will be reviewed every day that data are collected, and the accrued 
data reviewed again at the end of the study to ensure its validity and integrity. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_399998] a monthly basis to discuss study progress, data 
quality and any  unanticipated problems or findings will be reported upon occurrence.  
Reports  concerning the progress of the study and subject status will be  provided in the 
study closure report or when requested by [CONTACT_1201].  
 
If any protocol changes are needed, they will not be implemented prior to IRB approval , 
with possible exception of minor or administrative deviations which do not affect the 
scientific soundness of the research plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of human 
subjects. If a protocol deviation occurs which meets this definition for a minor deviation, the deviation will be reported to the JHM IRB at the time the continuing review application 
is submitted in eIRB us ing the Protocol Deviation Summary Sheet (R.F. 4) . 
 In the event of an emergency protocol deviation taken without prior IRB approval  to protect 
the life or physical well -being of a participant, it will be reported to the sponsor and the IRB 
of record as soon as possible, but not later than 5 days after the emergency situation occurred.  
 The research team s at all site locations will monitor subjects for adverse events throughout 
the study. Adverse events that fit the following criteria will be reported to JHM IRB within 
10 working days from the time when the principal investigator s become aware of them per 
JHM IRB policy: 
 
• Event is UNEXP ECTED (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) 
the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, 
such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document, 
and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• RELATED or POSSIBLY RELATED to participation in the study (possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, 
or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_400040]); 
and 
Environmental Localization Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399986]  2023 
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 18 • Suggests that the study PLACES SUBJECTS OR OTHERS AT A GREATER 
RISK OF HARM (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) 
than was previously known or recognized.  
 
The following unanticipated problems that are not adverse events will also be reported to 
the IRB within 10 days of becoming aware of them:  
 
• Unanticipated problems that do not fit the definition of an adverse event, but 
which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], involve risk to the subject, affect 
others in the study, or signi ficantly impact the integrity of study data. An 
example of this might be a report of accidental destruction of a study record; 
• Unplanned protocol deviations/violations that have already occurred, that may adversely affect the rights, safety or welfare of s ubjects or the integrity of the 
study data, AND for which IRB approval was not obtained.  
 
In reporting any deviations or adverse events  to the IRB , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_879] a report to the 
IRB of record in eIRB  via a Further Study Action for Protocol Event Report. 
 
In addition to reports issued to the IRB, any unanticipated problem involving risks to 
subjects or others or any serious or continuing noncompliance with [ADDRESS_504149]  be reported to the sponsoring agency  (NIH) and to the Office for 
Human Research Protections (OHRP), HHS , per NIH policy .

N/A. This is a non-significant risk study and interested candidates will not be undergoing 
medical procedures as part of this study. 
5.b Definitions of Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event is any undesirable experience associated with the use of a 
medical product in a patient.  Adverse events may occur during the course of this 
study. T he medical device that will be used in these studies  is the FDA HDE 
approved Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System .

Environmental Localization Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399986]  [ADDRESS_504150]:  
1. The augment ed system s expand  users ’ ability to identify target s in the field 
of view and to usefully interpret the egocentric information obtained from 
the retinal  prost hesis  by [CONTACT_400041].  
2. Aided by [CONTACT_400042], the retinal prosthesis is capable of enabling the formation of an externalized spatial image that aids navigation.  
 These hypotheses will be tested statistically with sighted subjects (see Section F ) 
by [CONTACT_400043]. Argus II subjects will be assessed individually to determine whether augmentation leads to lower error, and their error will be quantified through comparisons with the sighted subjects.  
 
F Statistical Plan  
F1  Sample Size Determination and Power  
 No significance testing will be possible with Argus II participants due to the small 
number of people expected to be recruited for each Argus II participant group in this study (approximately 5) . 
 Importantly, however, w e will use the sighted subjects , who simulat e the 
performance of Argus II users through the head mounted display conveying information similar to what is perceived by [CONTACT_400044], as a baseline. As 
described in G3, w e characterize performance by [CONTACT_400045].   
 
In particular, f or tests with sighted subjects, we use within- subject factorial designs 
and test with conventional ANOVA  statistics; inter- subject correlations between 
abilities tests can also be computed. We use sample sizes based on prospective power analysis.  A sample size of 20- 30 subjects was calculated with [9]  to achieve 
Environmental Localization Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_399986]  [ADDRESS_504151] designs  [10]. 
As a more general point, the experiments use a within- subject design, in which 
every subject provides a replicate of the entire study. In psychophysical research (i.e., where a physical variable is parametrically  explored), these designs are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_399999] 10- 20 participants . The proposed 
sample is also consistent with similar studies of navigation by [CONTACT_400046] (e.g., [11]). 
F2 Analysis Plan  
 For each measure, the Argus II participants will be characterized by [CONTACT_941] z -score 
distance of their performance fro m the sighted participants (as computed with their 
mean and variance). We will use two other approaches to assess the Argus II participants’ performance: (i) Use standards from the literature for basic psychophysical effects, including setting .2 as an eff ective d’ score for 2-  choice 
discrimination, based on Cohen’s d effect -size statistics; setting 25% as the 
expectation for a size difference threshold, and setting a standard of 15°  for 
absolute pointing error based on screening cutoffs in previous work . (ii) Set 
standards by [CONTACT_400047]; in particular, use distance expressed in device pi[INVESTIGATOR_400000]. Finally, we intend to test the effects of learning by [CONTACT_132641] g performance over time. For this, we will fit trends to the measures over 
repeated trials and assess the linear component for a positive slope.

INTRODUCTION  
Indication/Objectives  
Definition of indication  
Critical limb ischemia is a condition in which the blood circulation to the extremities (mostly the legs) is 
decreased to a degree that pain and non -healing wounds ensue. Mostly, this is a consequence of 
arteriosclerosis and/or diabetes. If surgical and other methods for improvement of revascularization have 
failed or are not poss ible, as a final option these patients need limb amputation.  
The Rutherford classification is a standard clinical staging system for peripheral artery disease. The 
classification has 7 stages;  
 
- Stage 0 – Asymptomatic  
- Stage 1 – Mild claudication  
- Stage 2 – Moderate claudication  
- Stage 3 – Severe claudication  
- Stage 4 – Continuous pain  
- Stage 5 – Ischemic ulceration not exceeding the digits of the foot  
- Stage 6 – Severe ischemic ulcers or frank gangrene  
An upward shift of 1 stage indicates improveme nt, except for stage 5 and 6, where a shift towards stag e 
3 is required for improvement/  
 The trial was originally intended to a randomized placebo control but was converted to be performed as 
an open label single arm clinical trial with ASCT01 administrat ion with approval from FDA. All patients 
received the autologous ASCT01 treatment. A staggered product administration approach for enrolment 
was used -a minimum of one week between administrations of the product to the first five subjects was 
allowed to st udy any potential effects of the product and/or the administration process.  
 
The treatment - was a one -time, one dose application carried out by [CONTACT_1963] - via 
angiographic application (80% of the dose). The remaining 20% ASCT01 was injected intramuscular 
distal of the obstruction and along the anatomic course of the a rtery or the neurovascular bundle in the 
ischemic limb. Selection and follow -up evaluation was performed by [CONTACT_601478].  
This Phase II (proof of concept) trial was conducted as a clinical study.  A total of 33 male and/or 
female patients  were screened, and 24 evaluable patients, completed the study.  The patients were  
evaluated till one year (12 months) post -administration with last patient out on March 30, 2017.  
 
Other variables also effect outcomes and reported mortality in success of r evascularization, which also 
correlates with the severity of the disease at presentation.   Rutherford stage 4 patients generally appear

to do better than stage 5; specifically, those requiring early major amputation. The stage [ADDRESS_796468] proliferation. Patients may progressive because of proximal 
disease changes as seen on a few MRA's. Resumption of smoking also appears  to have a clear negative 
effect.  
  
The primary efficacy outcome is considered a success if at 3 months after administration of the cell 
treatment there is no major amputation or has shown a 15% increase in ankle -brachial index (ABI) or 
transcutaneous oxim etry measurement (TCOM) from the measured baseline data . Other secondary 
variables such as pain analysis, would healing, angiography and walking distance, were also evaluated 
in this study for investigative purpose. The following summary is a review of the  outcomes . 
 
SUMMARY OF PRIMARY EFFICACY RESULTS : 
Major Amputations: There were 2 major amputations (both below knee) dur ing the 3 -month period  
(Table 5 ). Both major amputations occurred in patients who were Rutherford [ADDRESS_796469] 5 at baseline, major below amputa tions occurred in 8% of the patients 
during the 3 -month period. 2 more major amputation occurred during the 6 -month period evaluation and 
an additional 2 amputations occurred between the 6 -month and the 12 -month monitoring period or a total 
of 6 major amputations, however one of these patients received an amputation at a different clinic within 
33 days of the treatment. There were minor toe amputations recorded for 2 patients after the 3 -month 
period. Major amputation rates of 30 to 40% are not uncommon in such patients and has been seen in 
other studies.  Rutherford 5s enrolled with insufficient time for the stem cell effect may also exhibit 
rapid progression of other disease potentially leading to amputation . The late amputation patients who 
underwent below knee amputations have shown improvement after the cell therapy and in some cases 
preventing an above knee amputation.  
ABI and TcPO2  
The ankle -brachial index is an efficient tool for objectively documentin g the presence of lower -
extremity peripheral arterial disease  (PAD) and critical limb ischemia (CLI). It is a simple, reproducible, 
and cost -effective assessment that can be used to dete ct lower -extremity arterial stenosis in the primary 
care setting and transcutaneous oxygen measurement  (TCOM or TcPO 2) is a non -invasive method of 
measuring the oxygen  level of the tissue below the skin. Since oxygen is carried by [CONTACT_33428], TCOM 
can be used as an indirect measure of blood flow  to the tissue. Since blood flow is important for wound 
healing , TCOM is often used to gauge the ability of tissue to effectively heal. These parameters are used 
as combined primary parameters in the study.

There was more than 15% improvement in ABI  and/TcPO2  measurements  in 12 patients from that  
obtained at treatment date and in the open -label phase of the trial at 3 months  with some showing 
additional improvements at 6 months . One patient showed a 14.89 % more increase ( Table 2 ). 
SUMMARY OF MAJOR SECONDARY EFFICACY RESULTS:  
Pain Analysis  
Pain was assessed using a [ADDRESS_796470] scale changes  in some pa tients is  indicative of potential healing was 
observed however.  consistency could not be observed in this patent group.  
 
SUMMARY OF SAFETY EVALUATION:  
Safety and adverse events  
There was one death 6 months after treatment however the coroner’s information and PIs statement have 
conclusively ruled out any causative link to the stem cell treatment. There were no severe unexpected 
adverse events during this 3 -month reporting period and later (Table 4  (a, b and c) ). Bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_601465] h no complications in most and only minor complications in some related 
to injection pricks.  The hematology values have not shown any trends. Muscle injury due to the 
intramuscular injections was not observed clinically or any adverse effects or embolism with the infusion 
process were noted . Ophthalmologic examinations at screening demon strated baseline proliferative

SUMMARY OF STUDY  
1. SUMMARY PAGE  
Study title  An open -label single arm phase 2 study to assess the efficacy and 
safety of ASCT01 in Patients with Critical Limb Ischemia.  
Treatment  About 200 mL (150 +/ - 50 mL) of the patient’s bone marrow 
(BM) is aspi[INVESTIGATOR_601466] (s). The bone marrow was 
then transported to a processing site and processed to produce 
ASCT01 by a qualified institution operating under FDA cGMPs 
and cGTCPs.  
 
In the current study al patients, BM harvest, processing and 
treatment steps were completed on the same day, however the 
stability profile of ASCT01 allows for treatment within three 
days (72 hrs) after the bone marrow harvest.  
 
After angiographic visualization of the arterial stenosis in the 
affected limb, 80% of ASCT01 was infused intra -arterially 
proximal to the stenosis. The remaining 20% ASCT01 was 
injected intramuscular (IM) distal to the obstruction along the 
anatomic course of t he artery and the neuro -vascular bundle in 
the ischemic limb (at least 6 injections). The infusion dose was 
approximately 10 million cells per mL infused at a rate of 5 ml 
per minute using suitable catheters qualified for the 
administration. The sequence o f the IM and IA administration 
was at the investigators discretion. The intra -arterial infusion 
occurred via a metered infusion system ( BBraun Syringe pump 
or similar) that accommodating a 50 -60 ml syringe and infuse 
rates capability of 0 -999ml/hr)  with ei ther a Quick Cross 
Catheter of 0.035” (catalog 518 -038) or 0.018” (catalog 518 -
035) ID.  
 
The ASCT01 (cellular composition) prepared by [CONTACT_601479], cell count and viability varies with individual 
characteristics. The agency has reviewed the ASCT01 process 
and has confirmed that this process can be characterized as 
minimally manipulated -  Appendix 1.

Design Methodology  An open -label single arm phase 2 study to assess the efficacy 
and safety of ASCT01 in Patients with Critical Limb 
Ischemia (CLI) who would otherwise need amputation. For 
this trial, patients with a severe grade of CLI and categorized 
in the group of failed  traditional revascularization treatment 
patients (no option patients) were enrolled.  
 
Selected patients received ASCT01 treatment. The patients in 
the treatment group underwent bone marrow collection for 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_601469] [ADDRESS_796476](s). The bone marrow was processed to the required 
dilution of the ASCT01 at Kansas University Midwest Stem 
Cell Research Center and Biomedical Devices of Kansas 
operating under FDA cGMPs and cGTCPs.  
The bone marrow collection and the treatment  occurred for 
all patients on the same day. Although there is a provision for 
treatment up to [ADDRESS_796477].  
 
After angiograph ic visualization of the arterial stenosis in the 
affected limb, about 80% of diluted ASCT01 was infused 
intra-arterially (IA) proximal to the stenosis. The remaining 
20% ASCT01 was injected intramuscularly (IM) distal to the 
obstruction along the anatomic course of the artery and the 
neuro -vascular bundle in the ischemic limb (at least 6 
injections). The infusion dose is 10 million cells per mL 
infused at a rate of 5 ml per minute using suitable catheters 
qualified for the administration. The sequence of th e IM and 
IA administration was at the investigators discretion.  
 
The intra -arterial infusion occurred via metered infusion 
system ( Braun Syringe pump or similar) that accommodated 
a 50-60 ml syringe and can infuse at rates of 0 -999ml/hr)  
with either a Quick Cross Catheter of 0.035” (catalog 518 -
038) or 0.018” (catalog 518 -035) ID.  
After ASCT01 administration, the patients were evaluated at 
3 months for the primary end points evaluation and 
monitoring continued for a total period of 12 mo nths (the 
visit schedule table is at the end of the synopsis).

Statistical Evaluation  Statistical analysis was performed using SAS® package 
(SAS Institute Inc., [LOCATION_003], Version 9.3). for subject size 
requirement and power of the study based on the outcomes 
in the proof of concept. Comparative analysis for the 
number of treatment failures (i.e. major amputations or the 
number of unchanged Critical Limb Ischemia) for the 
treatment group with baseline data and the outcomes.  
Other Analyses of time to treatment failure and of time to 
amputation for the treatment group was evaluated.  
An external Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was 
used to oversee the conduct of the study as outlined in th e 
DSMB Charter.  The DSMB had access to the data and 
performed the following functions:

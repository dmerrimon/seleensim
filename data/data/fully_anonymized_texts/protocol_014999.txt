NOPSIS 1
TITLE:   A Phase 3, Open Label, Switch Over Study to Assess the Safety , Efficacy and 
Pharmacokinetics  of pegunigalsidase alfa ( PRX -102) 2.0 mg/kg Administered by [CONTACT_162819] 4 Weeks for 52 weeks  in Adult Patients with Fabry Disease Currently Treated 
with Enzyme Replacement Therapy : Fabrazyme® (agalsidase beta) or Replagal™ (agalsidase 
alfa) 
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:   Pegunigalsidase alfa, a PEGylated crossed linked  
recombinant human alpha  galactosidase -A  
INDICATION:   Pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX -102) is indicated for long -term enzyme 
replacement therapy  (ERT)  in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (alpha 
galactosidase deficiency) . 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:   3 
INVESTIGATIONAL SITES/LOCATIONS:   Multicenter  
OBJECTIVES:   To evaluate the safety , efficacy  and pharmacokinetics  of pegunigalsida se alfa 
(PRX -102) in patients with Fabry disease currently treated with currently commercially  
available ERT  (agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta) . 
STUDY DESIGN:   This is an open -label switchover study to assess the safety , efficacy , and 
pharmacokinetics  of peguni galsidase alfa treatment of 2  mg/kg every [ADDRESS_188936] 3 years and on a 
stable dose (>80% labelled dose/kg) for at least the last 6 months.  
Following screening, patient s will be enrol led and switched from their current ERT to receive 
intravenous (IV) infusions of pegunigalsidase 2  mg/kg every 4 weeks for 52 weeks (total of 14 
infusions) .  
At the time of enro llment, premedication, if used for the agalsidase alfa or agalsid ase beta 
infusions before enrol lment, will be continued using the same premedication regimen during 
the first infusion with pegunigalsidase alfa and then will be gradually tapered down at the 
Investigator ’s discretion during the next infusions based on Appendix 8. 
First infusions  of pegunigalsidase alfa will be administered under controlled conditions at the 
investigation site.  Based on Appendix 8, the patient s will be able to  receive their 
pegunigalsidase alfa infusions at a home care setup once the Investigator and Sponsor Medical 
Monitor agree that it is safe to do so.   
In the case of clear clinical deterioration,  the treat ment may be change d to 1.0 mg/kg every 2 
weeks at the Investigator ’s discretion and discussion with the Medical Monitor .

 INTRODUCTION 4
Fabry disease is a progressive lysosomal storage disease that is seriously debilitating and 
ultimately life-threatening.  It is caused by X-linked deficiency of the enzyme  galactosidase-A (-
GAL-A), and affects both males and females. The disease is characterized by [CONTACT_162824]-GAL-A. Clinical onset of the disease typi[INVESTIGATOR_162801] ( Schaefer et al., 2009 ) and will progress to end-stage renal disease, cardiac 
complications, and cerebrovascular problems in the fourth or fifth decade of life ( W ilcox et al.,  
2008 ). Although Fabry disease is a X-linked disorder, females are also affected and develop 
manifestations of the disease due to lack of cross-correction between cells with normal alpha-

L-A activity (mutated X chromosome is inactivated) and cells with enzyme deficiency (non-
mutated X chromosome is inactivated). The clinical abnormalities in females are more variable, 
and of later onset compared to males ( Schiffmann et al., 2009). 
F
abry disease is regarded as a rare disease and it is estimated that 1 in 40,000 males has the 
disease, whereas the estimated prevalence in the general population is 1 in 117,000 ( Meikle et al. 
1999). 
Alpha
-GAL-A is a lysosomal enzyme which primarily catalyses the hydrolysis of the glycolipid 
globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) to galactose and lactosylceramide. Fabry disease is characterized 
by [CONTACT_162825]3, predominantly in cells of the vascular system, cardiomyocytes, 
neuronal cells,  and kidney podocytes (Thurberg et al., 2002) . Progressive accumulation of Gb3 
and related lipi[INVESTIGATOR_162802]. The ultimate consequence of 
glycolipid deposition in the vasculature and other tissues is end-organ failure, particularly the 
kidney, but also heart and cerebrovascular system ( Schiffmann et al., 2009). In addition, 
invol
vement of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems result in epi[INVESTIGATOR_162803] 
a
nd impaired peripheral sensation. Vascular changes in the skin also result in angiokeratomas 
(Hoffmann et al., 2009). The mechanism by [CONTACT_162826]-GAL-A deficiency and glycolipid 
a
ccumulation cause such a wide variety of complications is not well understood. Based on the 
pathology of Fabry disease, the ongoing accumulation of alpha- D-galactosyl moieties, 
particularly of Gb3, appears to be a chronic toxicity state (Schiffmann et al., 2001) . A study by 
[CONTACT_162827]., reported that globotriaosylsphingosine (lysoGb3), a Gb3 metabolite, is dramatically 
increased in the plasma of male Fabry patients, and plasma and tissues of Fabry mice, and may 
have an important role in the pathogenesis of Fabry disease ( Aerts et al., 2008). Increased levels 
of
 lysoGb3 occur also in symptomatic Fabry females ( Van Breemen et al., 2011). 
As 
Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder, the prevalence of the mutation is predicted to be two 
times high er in women than in men. There is considerable variation in phenotype in 
heterozygous females. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_3404] X-linked nature of the disease, heterozygous and 
therefore tissue-mosaic females can be as severely affected by [CONTACT_162828], experiencing progressive, multi-organ involvement, reduced quality of life, and reduced 
li
fe expectancy. Case-finding studies have reported mutations that are known to be associated 
with Fabry disease in 0.3-2.4% of women who had unexplained stroke, hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, or renal failure requiring hemodialysis.  A study by [CONTACT_162829]., comparing 
men 
and women with Fabry disease, using data from Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS), showed no 
significant differences between men and women for most clinical features evaluated. Overall, 
both sexes responded to enzyme replacement treatment in a similar way ( Hughes et al., 2011).  
Enz
yme replacement therapy (ERT), by [CONTACT_162830], is nowadays among the most successfully employed drug treatments for lysosomal 
storage disorders. The first disorder for which this treatment modality has proven to be effective 
is type 1 Gaucher disease (Barton et al., 1991; Hollak  et al., 1995). This success has paved the 
wa
y for the development of ERT for other lysosomal storage disorders, including Fabry disease.

ecombinant human alpha-GAL- A can restore enzyme function in patients, and currently two 
ERTs using this enzyme are available; agalsidase-alfa (Replagal™), that was approved in Europe, 
a
nd agalsidase-beta (Fabrazyme®), that was approved both in Europe and in the [LOCATION_002]. 
B
oth recombinant enzymes are comparable in their properties and differ only slightly in glycan 
composition ( Blom et al.,  2003 ). They are produced using different protein expression systems 
and are administered at different doses. Fabrazyme® is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary 
(CHO) cells and is administered by [CONTACT_33433] 2 weeks at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Replagal™ is 
pr
oduced in a human cell line (stably expressed in human foreskin fibroblast) ( Schiffmann et al., 
2000), and is administrated by [CONTACT_33433] 2 weeks at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Both products 
ha
ve shown their efficacy in clinical studies regarding clearance of Gb3 from plasma, kidney 
cells (such as capi[INVESTIGATOR_117749], glomerular endothelial cells, noncapi[INVESTIGATOR_162804], and noncapi[INVESTIGATOR_162805]), and capi[INVESTIGATOR_162806] 
(Eng et al., 2001a; Germain et al., 2007; Schaefer et al., 2009 ). In addition, ERT with both 
products leads to improvement in quality of life, reduction or stabilization of cardiac mass, 
preservation of renal function, and slowing down the decline of glomerular function ( Wilcox et 
al., 2004; Schiffmann  et al.,  2006;  Weidemann et al., 2009;  Germain et al.,  2007; Schiffmann et 
al., 2009).  Although these findings are encouraging, the clinical effects of the current treatment 
of Fabry patients are not as robust as anticipated and show only limited clinical improvement 
(Schaefer et al., 2009;  L idove et al.,  2010; El Dib et al., 2011). 
One
 of the major factors responsible for the limited efficacy of current treatment is the presence 
of irreversible organ damage. Another factor that may contribute to this is the characteristics of 
the current ERTs (such as short circulatory ha lf-life and dose regimens) which seem to be 
insufficient in preventing the chronic toxic effect of Gb3. One way to improve enzyme 
bioavailability may be to extend circulation residence and tissue half-life. A third factor which 
may influence the treatment outcome is the induction of antibodies towards the recombinant 
proteins ( Hollak et al.,  2009 ). Emergence of antibodies with in vivo  neutralizing capacities is 
frequently encountered in treated Fabry disease patients, resulting in inhibition of enzyme 
activity and adversely affecting Gb3 clearance (Hollak et al., 2009). In early clinical studies, 25 
to 88% of male patients developed these IgG antibodies within the first 6 months of treatment 
(Schiffmann et al., 2006; Eng et al., 2001; Eng et al., 2001a ) . Regarding treatment outcome, it 
was shown that antibodies against alpha-GAL-A interfere with the clearance of Gb3 from 
plasma, urine ( Linthorst et al., 2004; Vedder et al.,  2008 ), and from the tissue ( Benichou et al., 
2009). The cross-reactivity of alpha- GAL - A antibodies suggests that it is unlikely that switching 
from one recombinant protein to the other may prevent the immune response and related effects 
(Linthorst et al., 2004; Hollak et al., 2009). Currently, administration of a higher dose of the 
re
combinant enzyme is an effective way to overcome the negative effect of the neutralizing 
antibodies (Vedder et al., 2008; Hollak et al., 2009). However, this approach is not considered a 
long-term solution. 
Prota
lix has developed p egunigalsidase alfa, a chemically modified recombinant human alpha-
GAL-A expressed in plant cell culture. Because of this modification, pegunigalsidase alfa 
e
xhibits more stabilized enzymatic activity, extended circulation residence time, and enhanced 
bioava
ilability of the enzyme relative to the commercial drugs.

______________________________________________________________________________  
 
16 of 60 P
egunigalsidase alfa was studied in Fabry disease patients in a Phase 1/2 study ( PB-102-F01) for 
12 
weeks and continued in a 9-month extension stud y (PB- 102-F02) for a total duration of one 
year.  The results of the se studies from 16 patients who completed the extension study, 6 each in 
the 0.2 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg treatment groups and four (4) in the 2.0 mg/kg treatment group, 
de
monstrated that after receiving one year of pegunigalsidase alfa  treatment: stable cardiac and 
renal function with favorable trends; Gb3 inclusion in kidney peritubular capi[INVESTIGATOR_162807]; a mean reduction in the total score of the Mainz Severity Score Index 
(MSSI ; Whybra et al., 2004 ) for the severity of Fabry disease in general, neurological, 
cardiovascular, and renal systems; a stable or favorable trend in the severity and frequency of 
a
bdominal pain and frequency of diarrhea in Gastrointestinal Symptoms Assessment (GSA); and 
reduction in pain severity score and pain interference score with the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 
scale, indicating an improvement in general activity, walking, working, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and enjoyment 
in life. 
The
 most commonly experienced all-cause adverse events ( AEs) were fatigue in [ADDRESS_188966] discomfort, dizziness, 
mac
ulopapular rash, and fatigue each in 2 patients. Two patients experienced a treatment-related 
serious adverse event (SAE): migraine and bronchospasm. The patient who experienced a Grade 
3 h
ypersensitivity-related bronchospasm led to the patient’s discontinuation from the study per 
protocol. Pegunigalsidase alfa PK parameters and profile in Fabry patients indicate dose 
depe
ndency. The enzyme was found to be available throughout the 2-week infusion intervals 
with a plasma half-life of approximately 80 hrs. The data from the se two studies conclude that 
dosing of pegunigalsidase alfa at 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks offers an optimal treatment regimen 
for attenuating disease progression in patients with Fabry disease, while indicating the option, 
based on the enzyme amount delivered, for the use of 2.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks to be used in 
patients with mild to moderate Fabry Disease currently treated with ERT.   
 Rationale 4.1
The rationale for this open label, switch over study is based on the enhanced PK profile of 
pegunigalsidase alfa. Phase 1/[ADDRESS_188967] 
peg
unigalsidase alfa 2.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks would be beneficial in patients with Fabry Disease 
currently treated with ERT.   
The weekly projected partial AUC and average concentration (Cave) indicate that there should 
be measurable levels of pegunigalsidase alfa at the third and fourth  weeks after infusion in the 
same order of magnitude as Fabrazyme® in the first week after infusion ( Ta ble 1:  ) . 
Calculations enabled the evaluation/estimation of the drug availability on weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 of 
pe
gunigalsidase alfa compared  to Fabrazyme® every other week following repeated dosing.  The 
ha
lf-life (t½) of 2.0 mg/k g p egunigalsidase alfa is ~ 80 hrs vs. ~2 hrs of Fabrazyme® and 
R
eplagal™ with Cmax values ~10x greater than those published for Fabrazyme® (Fabrazyme® 
USPI 2016). The estimated Cave of 2.0 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa every 4 weeks provides a 
c
oncentration of ~90 ng/mL at the 3rd  week and ~10 ng/mL at the 4th  week post infusion. Both 
values are greater than the negligible 2nd week Cave values for Fabrazyme® (Table 1:  ).

Note: Since the projection was done for repeated dosing, the different shading 
indicates the infusion intervals to make it easier to follow. 
This treatment dose and regimen is aimed as a maintenance program for Fabry patients without 
severe clinical symptoms with relatively slowing disease progression. Additionally, it may 
a
ddress the clinical needs of early or younger diagnosed patients. 
The
 unique PK parameters of pegunigalsidase alfa with the proposed dose and regimen have the 
potential 
to results with a comparable efficacy and safety profile with a reduced immunogenicity 
compared to current ERTs, with greater convenience leading to significant improvement in QOL . 
This has the potential to delay the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_162808]. This study will provide health care providers and patients

8.3.1 Adver se Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical 
trial. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
a
ssociated with the use of the study medication, whether or not considered related to the study 
medication. AEs will be collected from the start of treatment until [ADDRESS_188995] 30 days of the extension study will 
be considered the observation period for adverse events of this study (PB-102-F50).  Any events 
oc
curring prior to treatment will be recorded on the medical history page with the event name 
[CONTACT_162859].  Known p re-existing clinically significant 
conditions observed at screening should be recorded as medical history.  
This definition also includes accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug 
and/or dose) other than planned titration, reasons for admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or reasons for 
surgical procedures (unless for minor elective surgery for a pre-existing condition).  It also 
includes AEs commonly observed and AEs anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of 
the study medication. Any laboratory abnormality assessed as clinically significant by [CONTACT_162833].  
A treatment-emergent AE is any AE occurring after start of study medication and within the time 
of residual drug effect ([ADDRESS_188996] administration of the study medication; please note 
the above provision for subjects who enter the extension study), or a pre-treatment AE or pre-
existing medical condition that worsens in intensity after start of study medication and within the 
time of residual drug effect. 
AEs should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate sign(s) and symptom(s) are 
recorded. One diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record.  Treatment-related 
hypersensitivity/infusion reactions are defined in Appendix 3.  Pegunigalsidase alfa 
H
ypersensitivity Evaluation and Treatment Algorithm  and can be defined as a single AE at the 
Investigator’s discretion.   
Note that death is not an event, but the cause of death is.  An exception is the event of sudden 
death of unknown cause. Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_162809]; however, the reason for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138]. Procedures are not events; the reasons for conducting the procedures are. In 
general, only the reason for conducting the procedure will be captured as an AE. However, if 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_737], a procedure can be captured along with the reason for 
conducting the procedure. 
An overdose is not an AE unless it is temporally associated with an unfavorable or unintended 
sign or symptom.   
Each AE is to be classified by [CONTACT_162834]-serious.  A serious adverse event 
(SAE)
 is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that occurs at any dose:

 R equires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 R esults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 I s associated with a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 I s an important medical event 
An AE caused by [CONTACT_162835] a criterion listed in the 
definition above is fulfilled. 
Important AEs that may not result in death, may not be life-threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject’s safety or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above. 
SAEs also include any other event that the Investigator or sponsor judges to be serious or which 
is defined as serious by [CONTACT_61462]. 
The Investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_162836].  In addition, each trial subject will be questioned 
about AEs.  The question asked will be “Since you began taking the study medication, have you 
had any health problems?” 
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures for Assessing, Recording, and Reporting AEs and SAEs 
Thr
oughout the duration of the study, the Investigator will closely monitor each subject for 
evidence of drug intolerance and for the development of clinical or laboratory evidence of AEs.  
All AEs (expected or unexpected) which occur during the course of the study, whether observed 
by [CONTACT_162837], and whether or not thought to be drug-related, will be 
reported and followed until resolution or until they become stable. 
The description of the AE will include description of the event, start date, stop date, intensity, if 
it was serious, relationship to test drug, change in test drug dosage, if the subject died, and if 
treatment was required. 
AEs with the causality assessed as possible or probable are categorized as related to study 
medication and are called adverse drug reactions. 
All SAEs must be reported immediately (no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
event) by [CONTACT_162838]. The Sponsor’s Medical 
Director and Safety Monitor will be notified of the event by [CONTACT_1624]. In the case that 
the eCRF system is not available, the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_46133] (972-54 -
2228472) or Safety Monitor ([PHONE_3580]) to notify the Sponsor of the event.

Severity  Definition  
Mild (Grade 1)  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity  
Moderate (Grade 2)  Discomfort sufficient to interfere, but not prevent, daily activity  
Severe (Grade 3)  Unable to carry out usual activity  
Very severe (Grade 4)  Incapacitating, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], resu lts in death  
Category  Definition  
Unrelated  Clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes, and does not meet criteria 
listed under possible or probable.  
Unlikely  Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration. May have been 
produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_162839][INVESTIGATOR_124888].  
Possible  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration, but may have been also 
produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, environmental factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_124888].  
Probable  Clear -cut temporal association with administration with improvement on cessation of 
investigational medicinal product or reduction in dose. Reappears upon rechallenge. 
Follows a known pattern of response t o the investigational medicinal product.  
Definitely  There is evidence of exposure to the test product, for example, reliable history or 
acceptable compliance assessment; the temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the 
drug is reasonable; the AE is m ost likely to be explained by [CONTACT_162840]; the challenge is positive; re -challenge (if feasible) is positive; the AE shows 
a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the drug treatment.

its standard error, median, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range).  
eGFR is calculated from the serum creatinine according to the CKD-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_14420]. Intra-patient 
comparison will be also evaluated. 
10.3.2 Safety Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
Adverse events (AE) will be coded to system organ class and preferred term using MedDRA 
version 9.1 or higher.  All AEs occurring after the initiation of the study treatment (treatment-
emergent AEs) will be reported, including events present at baseline that worsened during the 
study. 
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_162844] t 
groups with respect to incidence of AEs (the number of subjects reporting at least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] 
a specific AE), incidence of AEs by [CONTACT_162845], incidence of AEs by [CONTACT_162846], and incidence of AEs causing withdrawal and incidence of SAEs.  
Regarding severity and attribution summaries, the most extreme outcome (highest severity and 
closest to study drug related) will be used for those subjects who experience the same AE on 
more than one occasion.  
Hypersensitivity reactions will be analyzed as AEs of special interest using descriptive statistics. 
W
ritten narratives will be provided for all serious, unexpected or other significant AEs that are 
judged to be of special interest because of their clinical importance. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory 
Clinical Laboratory examinations will be performed prior to and during treatment. 
De
scriptive statistics will be presented for the value and abnormality of each of the clinical 
laboratory results by [CONTACT_162847].  Shift tables describing abnormality shifts from 
baseline to after treatment and follow-up will be created. 
10.3.3 Interim Analysis 
An interim analysis may be performed for administrative purposes. 
10.3.4 Missing Data 
No imputation will be made for missing values of safety endpoints except for some AE 
parameters as described above. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_162814] (AKI) will be considered missing data for the purposes of the 
efficacy analysis.  AKI will be defined by a 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine from the 
immediately previous laboratory value and assessment by [CONTACT_737].  However, prior to 
Protocol PB-[ADDRESS_189026]:  2017-001528-23 25 J ul 2018 
______________________________________________________________________________  
 
38 of 60 da
ta base lock, cases of AKI will be assessed by [CONTACT_162848]. Their 
evaluation will include whether they agree that AKI occurred in a patient and whether serum 
creatinine values should be excluded from the eGFR slope calculations for the primary endpoint.  
Excluded serum creatinine values will be considered missing data. 
 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 11
 Source Data and Records 11.1
Source data are all the information in original records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_2149], observations, laboratory reports, data sheets provided by [CONTACT_162849], which are necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. 
The Investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audit(s), IRB review(s), and regulatory 
inspection(s), with direct access to all the required source records.

endix 2.  Tolerability and Infusion Rate Algorithm 14.2
The
 infusion rate (IR) may be adjusted according to individual subject signs and symptoms.  The 
assumptions with respect to adverse experiences to the infusion are: 
1. Most  of the subjects will tolerate the infusion without any special symptom or event.  
2. Subjects presenting with signs and symptoms of severe  hypersensitivity will be evaluated 
according to the CTCAE Drug Toxicity criteria and there may be a discontinuation of 
treatment according to the protocol. 
3. Subjects may present with signs and symptoms that will respond to reducing the infusion 
rate and may not appear at the next infusion. 
4. Tole rability and the subject-specific infusion rate will be assessed and decided by [CONTACT_162854]. 
Definitions to be applied regarding tolerability of infusions are as follows: 
Good Tolerability  Partial Tolerability  Poor Tolerability  
Infusion was performed 
without signs and symptoms 
(such as burning, pruritus, 
flushing, discomfort, or 
change in vital signs).  Signs and symptoms appeared 
during the infusion and 
resolved after slowing  the 
infusion rate  or at the end of 
the infusion.  Signs and symptoms meeting 
the definitions of CTCAE  
Grade 1 or 2 toxicity 
responding to reduction of 
infusion rate or responding to  
treatment ( e.g., antihistamine 
for urticaria).

Estimates of GFR are the best overall indices of the level of kidney function. The level of GFR 
should be estimated from prediction equations that take into account the serum creatinine 
concentration and some or all of the following variables: age, gender, race, and body size. 
Among adults, the CKD-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_162817] a clinically useful estimate of GFR ( Levey et al.,  
2009).  This equation provides an estimate of GFR standardized for body surface area. 
14.5.2 CKD-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_8850]:  
The CKD-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908] ( Levey et al. , 2009) p erformed better than the MDRD (Modification of 
Diet in Renal Disease Study ; Levey et al., 2006 )  equation, especially at higher GFR, with less 
bias and greater accuracy. When looking at NHANES (National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey) data, the median estimated GFR was 94.5 vs. 85.0 mL/min per 1.73 m2, 
and the prevalence of chronic kidney disease was 11.5% vs 13.1%. The CKD-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908], 
e
xpressed as a single equation, is: 
GFR = 141 * min(Scr/κ,1)α * max(Scr/κ,1)-1.209 * 0.993Age * 1.018 [if female] * 1.159 [if 
black/African American] 
Scr: serum creatinine (mg/dL),  
κ: 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males,  
α: -0.329 for females and –0.411 for males,  
min: indicates the minimum of Scr/κ or 1, and  
max: indicates the maximum of Scr/κ or 1.

Protocol PB-[ADDRESS_189051]:  2017-001528-[ADDRESS_189052]:  2017-001528-[ADDRESS_189053]-Infusion  
Proposed schedule to: 
1. Ta per down premedication 
2. I ncrease infusion rate 
3. R educe  observation time after infusion 
The schedule below, will guide the sites on the process to taper down premedication, increase the 
infusion rate up to minimal time of infusion allowed by [CONTACT_162856], and reduce the observation time after infusion.  At the end of the process, the patient 
may be offered to continue therapy in a home care setup based on the Investigator evaluation and 
discussion with the Medical Director. 
General considerations: 
1. P atients whose weight is up to (≤)[ADDRESS_189054] infusion will be 4.5 hours. 
2. Patients whose weight is more than (>) [ADDRESS_189055] infusion will be 6 
hours. 
3. C linical follow-up (observation) after the infusion in all rates will be [ADDRESS_189056] infusion of 
pegunigalsidase alfa with the same protocol of premedication as with the previous ERT. 
5. All cha nges can be implemented only if there is good tolerability of the previous change. 
6. I n the case of questionable tolerability, the continuation of the process will be discussed 
between the Investigator and the Medical Director. 
1. T aper down premedication 
The principle in the process is: 
On the first infusion: the subject will continue the premedication as  in previous ERT tratment. 
On the next  infusion, one of the medications used as premedication will be removed. If well 
tolerated, on the next infusion, additional medication used as premedication will be removed 
(when applicable).  This regimen will continiue up to tapering down all premedications, or best 
tolerability to the infusion is achieved.

58 of 60 2. Re duce infusion time  
The principle in the process is: 
Reduction in the infusion time will start after an attempt was done to taper down the 
premedication based on patient tolerability.  The length of infusion will be reduced by 0.[ADDRESS_189058] tolerated infusion length or an infusion of 2 hours (for 
pa
tients ≤ 100 kg weight) or 3 hours (for patients weighing more than 100 kg). 
3. Re duce observation time after infusion  
The principle in the process is: 
The process for reducing observation time after the infusion will start after the attempt of 
tapering down the premedication was finalized (when one of the results could be the patient will 
remain on premedication).  Until then, the post-infusion observation will be [ADDRESS_189059]-infusion.  
4. Re ferring the patient to home care set- up 
The patients will be able to join the home care program once the patient is clinically stable with 
no additional changes in premedication, infusion rate, and observation time.  
The changes require discussion and approval by [CONTACT_1689]/Director. 
Table [ADDRESS_189060] infusion observation; Other regimens need to be discussed and approved by [CONTACT_5134]/Director.

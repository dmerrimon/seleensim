I. Purpose, Background and Rationale  
A. Abstract  
More than 40 million Americans are currently taking  statins for the treatment or prevention of 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_765082] (CVD). Based on the new usage guidelines from the 
American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) (2), that number is expected to increase to over 60 million (3), reflecting the growing sentiment for more wide -spread use 
of statins, even in otherwise asymptomatic patients. Although generally well -tolerated, statin therapy is 
not without risks. The most common reported side effects include mild to moderate muscle weakness, 
fatigue and/or pain, the incidence of which increase as a function of both dose and duration of statin 
use (4, 5). Statins also increase the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_861199], including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (6 -9). The underlying mechanism(s) for these complications is 
unknown. In recent years however, evidence has been mounting from both cell culture and animal models that statins interfere with mitochondrial function in muscle (10 -12). In the present application, 
we provide data from both ex vivo and in vivo preliminary studies in humans suggesting that statins induce progressive and quite striking reductions in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_861200] . The overall aim of  the study is to examine whether  statin treatments 
differentially blunt the mitochondrial, metabolic, and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_861201].  Our hypothesis is statin therapy will impair  exercise induced adaptations in skeletal muscle  
mitochondria content and function (respi[INVESTIGATOR_861202]), cardiovascular 
responses, and  systemic insulin sensitivity.  
  
B. Background and Significance  
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly one of every four adults over 40 years of age is taking a statin –  which equates to more than 40 million Americans. This number is 
predicted to increase to over 60 million Americans (3) under the new guidelines released in  2013 by [CONTACT_861235] (ACC/AHA). The new guidelines which emphasize prevention of stroke as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) , simplify evaluation  by 
[CONTACT_861236], and feature a risk prediction  algorithm  (14). The new 
guidelines represent a departure from the 2002 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III statin therapy recommendations based on LDL -C treatment target levels of <70 -
100 mg/dl, depending on risk (15). Although not without controversy (16), the new algorithm recommends initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention in patients with a predicted 10 -year risk 
of CVD of ≥7.5% and consideration of statin therapy for patients with 10 -year risks of between 5 -

Fig 1. Relationship  between  maximal  oxygen  uptake and 
age in sedentary,  active and endurance trained  subjects.  
The figure  is adapted  from Wilson  and Tanaka  (1) and 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_861203] (solid  red 
line) or accelerate (dotted  red line) the loss of aerobic  
capacity  relative  to age and therefore morbidity  and mortality.  7.5%. Backed by a recent study spanning six continents showing a small but significant decrease in 
CVD events (17) the new guidelines  are expected  to lead to a dramatic increase in the use of statins 
world -wide for primary prevention in middle -aged individuals who do not have , but are at risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_179558]. 
Without question, statin therapy is extremely effective at lowering LDL -C and risk for CVD in high risk 
populations, and, in general, statins are well- tolerated (18).  Muscle fatigue, pain and weakness are 
idiopathic but well known potential side effects. Less appreciated is the fact that statins  also increase  
the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_216184]/type 2 diabetes (6 -9, 19-21) and attenuate the beneficial 
effects of exercise on cardiovascular adaptations and fitness (13). In fact, statins when combined with exercise increase the risk and severity of adverse muscle reactions (22 -24). This interaction effect is of 
obvious concern given the importance of physical activity in the clinical treatment of patients with type 
2 diabetes and/or CVD. Although the mechanism(s) underlying the side effects of statins is unknown, 
there is evidence that the impact of statins on skeletal muscle may be progressive. In the only direct comparative cohort study between patients on statins and matched controls, duration of statin therapy (< 10 vs. ≥ 10 months) was found to increase the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_771934] -related side effects (5), which is 
consistent with clinical reports of some patients experiencing symptoms only after years of statin therapy (25).  Perhaps most alarming, mounting evidence, 
including preliminary data in  this application,  indicates  
that statins directly compromise mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_2606], providing a potential unifying mechanism for the dose- and duration -dependent complications associated 
with statin use. Clinically, because the loss of aerobic capacity with age (Fig. 1)(1) is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality (26, 27) a direct inhibition of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_861204] (see redline) and hasten 
the decline in aerobic capacity needed to support daily 
living (Fig. 1). This is especially alarming given that the greatest increase in statin prescription is predicted to occur in adults >[ADDRESS_1200443] low aerobic capacity (3) and that statin therapy is being widely advocated for younger individuals, meaning 
that lifetime statin use may potentiate aging induced loss of aerobic capacity (28). Thus, while the risk for CVD undoubtedly favors statin therapy for many patients, it is imperative to develop a better understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying the effect of statins on muscle biology to better define 
the risk –  benefit ratio for all patients.  
The widespread use of statins combined with the potential for more aggressive use of high intensity 
statin therapy emphasizes the urgency and importance of this research topic to the medical 
community. Importantly, we are studying one of the most widely prescribed and utilized statins, atorvastatin (trade name “Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_17133]”) (29) making the outcomes applicable to a large number of statin users. In addition, high dose (80 mg/day) atorvastatin is widely employed as the “go to” dose based on data from three clinical trials showing the largest effect in terms of lowering of CVD risk (30 -32). This 
will immediately help physicians and patients make better -informed decisions, thereby [CONTACT_861237].  
 
 
 
KUMC – HRPP-  03/12/[ADDRESS_1200444] line of treatment  for patients  at risk for the metabolic  syndrome  and CVD 
because  they lower lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (LDL-C and TG) and reduce  CVD. Although,  statins  undoubtedly  reduce  
CVD, they have been shown  to increase  both insulin  resistance  (8, 9, 20, 21) and rates of type 2 
diabetes  development  in large cohort  studies  (6, 7, 19). Importantly,  the mechanism(s)  linking  
statins  to insulin  resistance  and type 2 diabetes  remain  unknown.  Statin  induced  mitochondrial  
dysfunction  in skeletal  muscle  is one of the suggested mechanism(s)  for statin  induced  insulin  
resistance,  but this has not been directly  tested.  
Although  statins provide  a powerful  20-40% reduction  in relative  risk for CVD (19, 85-87), there 
is still room for improvement  through  the use of potent  lifestyle  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_861205].  
At risk patients  are commonly  encouraged  to start a regular  aerobic  exercise  program,  that can 
also lower  LDL-C and TG, and unlike  statins,  is a proven  efficacious  treatment to improve  
insulin  sensitivity  and protect  against  type 2 diabetes  (88, 89). The ability  of exercise  to 
increase  skeletal muscle  mitochondrial  content  and function is believed  to play an important  
role in improving  skeletal muscle  insulin  sensitivity.  Exercise  also increases  cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_801974]  (VO2peak ), which  is a critical  adaptation  because  low fitness  is a powerful  independent  
risk factor  for CVD, type 2 diabetes, and overall  mortality  (26, 27, 90-92). In fact, mid-life fitness  
is an excellent  prognosticator of susceptibility  for chronic  disease  conditions  later in life (93). A 
recent  study  implicated  statin  therapy  in reducing  physical  activity  levels  by a significant  amount  
in free living  individuals  (94). Importantly,  another  trial found  that alterations  in physical  activity  
(measured  by [CONTACT_861238])  significantly  impacted  CVD risk in at risk patients  regardless  of 
pharmacotherapy  treatment  suggesting that increasing  or maintaining  physical  activity  
throughout  the lifespan  is paramount  for CVD protection  (95). In summary,  these  findings  
suggest  that the most complete  treatment  for patients  at risk for CVD would combine  both statin  
and exercise  therapy  in addition  to maintenance  of moderate  to high daily physical  activity.  
 
Although many clinical reviews propose harmful interactions with exercise and statins, until a recent report from our lab, there were no carefully controlled studies. We published a trial comparing the effects of 12 
weeks of exercise vs. 
exercise + statin therapy (40 mg/day simvastatin) in previously sedentary obese participants with 2/5 metabolic syndrome risk factors (13). Our results showed that statins blocked both exercise induced increases in whole body cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_861206]. As shown in Table 1,  the exercise  only group  experienced  a 9%  
increase in cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] (VO2peak) and a 13% increase in mitochondrial content (measured by [CONTACT_861239]), while the  statin plus exercise group had 1%, and - 4% changes, 
respectively. We also now have preliminary  data in a subset  of subjects (n=15) that centrally mediated 
cardiovascular effects were blunted by [CONTACT_275084]. Exercise training lowered resting heart rate as expected in the exercise only group (Pre: 67±1.[ADDRESS_1200445]: 64±1.7; P<0.05), but did not lower heart rate in the exercise + statin group (Pre: 64±2.[ADDRESS_1200446]: 65±2.5). Importantly, statin induced blunting Table 1  Exercise Only (n=19)  Statins + Exercise (n=18)

induced myopathies (no myopathies reported).  
We posit that statin induced impairments in mitochondrial function play a primary role in mitigating 
exercise training responses; however, this hypothesis needs further testing. The next step is to 
determine if statins modify mitochondrial adaptations including respi[INVESTIGATOR_861207], H202 emission, and transcriptional factors that control mitochondrial biogenesis, providing greater mechanistic insight of the potential negative  interaction between exercise and statin therapy. Another factor that needs to be 
explored is if a lower dose of statin therapy will not block or mitigate exercise adaptations. Physicians reportedly lower the dose of  statins for individuals who complain of problems with exercise but this 
approach has not been experimentally tested. In summary, the goals this project  are to build upon our 
previously published data to determine if atorvastatin, now the most commonly prescribed statin,  
impairs  exercise  induced  adaptations  in skeletal  muscle mitochondria content and function (respi[INVESTIGATOR_861208]), cardiovascular responses, and  systemic insulin sensitivity. An additional 
goal is to determine if low dose atorvastatin (20 mg/day) does not block these exercise training adaptations, an outcome that would provide physicians a new treatment option for patients who want to exercise and/or increase daily physical activity but also require statin therapy.  
 
II. Research Plan  and Design  
 
A. Study Objectives : The overall aim of the study is to  determine whether low or high intensity 
statin treatments differentially blunt the mitochondrial, metabolic, and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_861209].   
a. Primary Objective :  
i. Changes in Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] (VO2peak) : Subjects  will be tested  for 
VO2peak at baseline and post training using a Bruce protocol on a treadmill as 
previously performed (13, 97). Relative (ml/kg -1/min -1) and absolute (L/min -1) 
VO2peak and treadmill time to exhaustion will be used as determinants of fitness while additional measures of respi[INVESTIGATOR_38952] (RQ) and heart rate at each stage of the GXT, and heart rate recovery and excess post oxygen consumption 
following the test will also be  measured as determinants of exercise  training 
adaptations. Blood CK levels will be assessed 30 minutes following the cessation 
of exercise and also 24  hour later. In addition , sub-maximal exercise (60% HRR) 
measures of heart rate, RQ, and O2 consumption will also be determined during 
exercise training sessions occurring during the first week and the  last week of 
training.   
b. Secondary Objectives :  
i. Mitochondrial Responses in  Skeletal  Muscle : Multiple aspects of mitochondrial 
function (basal and ADP -stimulated respi[INVESTIGATOR_861210], H 2O2 production and emitting potential) will be assessed in 
duplicate on permeabilized fiber bundles from freshly obtained muscle biopsy samples as previously described (61 -64). Fibers are then freeze dried for 
determination of citrate synthase activity (index of mitochondrial content). Frozen muscle tissue will also be analyzed for electron tra nsport complex activity , content 
(Western blot using complex I through V antibody cocktail) and cellular redox state (GSH/GSSG, thioredoxinred/thioredoxinox) as previously described (63).Of 
the remaining approximate ≥90 mg of muscle biopsy tissue, a small portion (<5 
 
 
 
KUMC – HRPP- 03/12/2015   Page 5 of 25
  
 
 
 mg) will be prepped for electron microscopy for future analysis of morphology 
(mitochondrial size, content, ragged muscle fiber analysis) (66). Remaining muscle will be frozen for later analysis of intracellular atorvastatin concentration 
(both the acid and lactone forms) (67), ubiquinone (co -enzyme Q10) (68, 69), 
and potential future gene array, metabolomics, or proteomics analysis. An in -vivo 
assessment of mitochondrial function using NIRS  will determine  muscle oxygen 
consumption (mVO2) and the recovery kinetics will be determined during a series 
of repeated arterial occlusions following maximal knee extension. The mVO2 data are fit to a mono- exponential function to calculate the rate constant, which is 
directly related to the mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_14008]. (46). The protein and 
mRNA for key transcriptional factors controlling mitochondrial biogenesis and 
function will also be measured (PGC -1α, NRF -1, NRF -2, mTFA) in all subjects as 
done previously (98, 99). In addition, muscle will be frozen in OCT to examine if 
there are altered fiber type changes, and or other important markers including apoptosis (TUNEL staining).  
ii. Body Composition, Physical Function, Pain Assessments, and Physical Activity :. 
DEXA will measure bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition (fat mass, fat -free mass, and percent body fat).  Pressure 
thresholds will be determined using an  algometer  during rest and after exercise.  
Current and usual w hole body muscle pain while resting using 0 -10 numeric scale. 
Steps, physical activity and sedentary time will be determined over a 5 -day period 
using pedometers and accelerometers . (BodyMedia Sensewear) . 
iii. F
asting Blood Draw : Glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL -C, LDL -C, and 
triglycerides, CK,  creatinine  and ALT will be measured in fasting blood samples.  
iv. I nsulin Sensitivity : Glucose and insulin, and insulin sensitivity will be calculated 
using a minimal model program following the IVGTT.  
v. C ardiovascular Function : Heart  rate ECG  will be measured under  resting  and 
maximal  exercise  conditions.   
B. Study T ype and D esign : This study is a longitudinal, repeated measures, double -blinded 
design with  subjects  randomly assigned to placebo, low (20 mg/d) or high (80 mg/d) 
atorvastatin therapy during a [ADDRESS_1200448] to  screen 
approximately 150 participants to enroll  (randomize)  a maximum of [ADDRESS_1200449] 60 participants complete all study procedures (20 in each group).   Repeated 
measures design allows each subject to serve as their own control.  Placebo groups are included 
to account for potential changes in muscle mitochondrial function independent of statin therapy 
over the 1 year dose -response.  
C. Sample size , statistical methods,  and power calculation : The randomization for study 
drugs will be carried out by [CONTACT_861240] a computer -based random number 
generator at a 1:1:1 allocation. Sample  size for the  study is powered on the  powered on the 
basis of detecting a difference in VO2peak between the EX+Plac group and the EX+Atorva80 group as well as between the EX+Atorva20 group and the EX+Atorva80 group at [ADDRESS_1200450]-treatment. In our previously published study(13) (Table 2) the EX only group had a mean 
2.6 ml/kg/min increase in VO2peak following 12 weeks of training while the EX+Statin group only had a 0.4 ml/kg/min increase in VO2peak. The estimated effect size of between group differences is 0.9 (Cohen’s d). The increase of VO2peak in the EX+Atorva20 group is expected 
 
 
 
KUMC – HRPP-  03/12/2015   Page 6 of 25
  
 
 
 to be similar to that of EX+Plac group. A sample size of 35 per group provides 80% of power of 
detecting an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_1200451] a difference of 1.53 ml/kg/min VO2peak between groups. These power calculations led to a desired final sample size of 105 (35/group). We plan an enrollment of 120 (40/group) subjects to account for 10% dropout rate. The subject enrollment will be split equally between the two sites.  As an exploratory analysis, the mean difference of VO2peak (EX+ 
Atorva20 - EX+ placebo) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated. If the lower 
bound of the 95% confidence interval is greater than - 0.8 ml/kg/min, EX+ Atorva20 will be 
considered non -inferior to EX+ placebo.

b. Withdrawal/Termination criteria: Subjects are free to abstain from taking their 
statins and leave the study at any time.  We will test both muscle enzymes (creatine 
kinase) and liver enzymes (ALT) to determine if statins are causing either muscle 
myopathies or liver injury.  This testing will occur at baseline and at [ADDRESS_1200452] will be taken out of the study for their own 
health.  
 
E. Specific methods and techniques  
This stu dy will require approximately 13 total study visits plus exercising 5 times per week . The total 
time commitment of study visits is approximately 30 hours over the 12 weeks  of study participation.  
 
  
 
 
a. Testing Procedure  
i. Telephone screen:  A telephone screen will be used to collect health history, 
concurrent medications, and physical activity level of potential participants prior to 
in-person screening.  
 
 
 
KUMC – HRPP- 03/12/2015   Page 8 of 25
  
 
 
  
ii. Blood draw : A screening blood draw will be used to determine presence of genetic 
markers associated with increased risk of myopathy from statin, creatine kinase 
(CK), kidney function (GFR) and liver enzymes (ALT). CK , GFR  and ALT will be  
used to detect abnormal muscle, kidney or liver function prior to enrollment . A 
blood draw will be repeated at [ADDRESS_1200453] (IVGTT) : The subject will arrive following an 
overnight fast (10 -12 hrs). Upon arrival, anthropometrics and vital signs will be 
measured. A catheter will be placed in one arm for blood draws. A fasting blood 
draw (~14 -16mls) will be used to determine blood  glucose,  insulin,  total 
cholesterol,  HDL-C, LDL-C, triglyceride s. Creatine kinase (CK) and liver enzymes 
(ALT)  will be tested at [ADDRESS_1200454] abnormal myopathy, and changes in liver function from statin use for 
participant safety. Following the baseline draw glucose (50%) will be injected at a dose of 0.3 g/kg.  Insulin  will be mixed with the participant’s blood for injection. 
Blood (5ml) and insulin (1.25 ml) will be injected into a 250 ml bag of sterile saline and mixed thoroughly.  A dose of 0.025 U/kg body mass will be administered  at 
minute 20.  These mixing procedures have been safely preformed at the CTSU for a 
recent study (INFORM; HSC#[ZIP_CODE]). . Serial blood samples (25 total) will be 
obtained from the other arm at minutes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 19, 22, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, and 180. Plasma will be frozen at -80°C for later determination of glucose and insulin, and insulin sensitivity will be 
calculated using a minimal model program (77).  A total of approximately [ADDRESS_1200455] is complete any remaining blood samples will be stored indefinitely for future research. Fasting blood draw will be repeated at , 4 and 12 weeks . The 
IVGTT will be repeated at week12.  
iv. Mu
scle biopsy : After an overnight fast, the participant will  complete a survey to 
confirm the absence of bleeding disorders, and avoidance of NSAIDs and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_861211] 7 days prior to biopsy. Participants will then  lie on a table in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. 
A location on the mid -thigh will be identified. The area will be properly shaved and 
then thoroughly cleaned using sterile techniques (alcohol and iodine). A sterile 
drape is then placed over the leg with the biopsy site showing through a fenestration in the center of the drape. A numbing agent will be lightly sprayed onto the biopsy location (ethyl chloride) immediately before the skin, adipose, and muscle fascia is anesthetized with lidocaine (1 -2% HCL). After allowing 1 -2 
minutes for the site to become numb the skin and fascia is incised with a sterile 
scalpel (#11). The Bergstrom needle (5mm) is then placed through the incision 
into the vastus lateralis muscle. Suction is applied to the proximal port of the needle, and the tissue is cut rapi[INVESTIGATOR_861212], and the entire needle is removed from the incision. Sterile gauze is placed on the incision site and pressure is applied with an ice pack for ~5 minutes. The site is then closed with a steri -strip and band -aid. Sterile gauze is then applied on top of 
the band -aid and pressure is applied by [CONTACT_6406][INVESTIGATOR_861213]. 
Approximately 100- 200 mg of skeletal muscle will be collected during each biopsy 
in one pass. In the case where less muscle is harvested per pass, one more 
additional pass will be taken with the participants consent. The tissue collected is 
 
 
 
KUMC – HRPP- 03/12/2015   Page 9 of 25
  
 
 
 dissected free of connective tissue and separated for mitochondrial function 
studies or frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent biochemical analyses as done 
previously (13, 61). After analysis for current project is complete any remaining 
muscle samples will be stored indefinitely for future research.  Muscle biopsies will 
be repeated at [ADDRESS_1200456]. Thyfault has performed over 300 
skeletal muscle biopsies without incidence since starting his independent lab in 2005. See appendix for letter from IRB Director (Michele Kennett) at [CONTACT_861266]’s 
previous institution (MU) stating his record for conducting muscle biopsies and a 
letter of support for the procedure from [CONTACT_713453], the Director of the CTSU.  
Additionally, Neurologists who study various muscle diseases regularly perform the 
technique at KUMC.   Muscle biopsies will be repeated at 4   and 12 weeks . 
v. Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) : Muscle mitochondrial functional capacity will 
be measured non -invasively using a NIRS technique developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Terence 
Ryan, a member of the research team at ECU (46). Participants will perform 
submaximal knee extension exercise to increase muscle oxygen  consumption 
(mVO 2) and the recovery kinetics is determined during a series of repeated 
arterial occlusions. The mVO 2 data are fit to a mono- exponential function to 
calculate the rate constant, which is directly related to the mitochondrial 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_14008]. NIRS will be repeated at  week 12.  
vi. P ain Assessment : Pressure pain threshold will be objectively assessed by a 
computerized algometer at rest and after exercise (73). In addition, we will ask participants to rate their current and usual whole body muscle pain while resting and moving using 0 -10 numeric scales (0 = no pain, 10 = most intense pain 
imaginable) at different time points. We will ask the participants to rate the highest pain felt immediately and for up to [ADDRESS_1200457], as well as 24 hours later. Pain assessments will be repeated at  week 
12. 
vii. M
uscular Strength Assessment:  Knee isometric strength will be assessed using  a 
Biodex dynamometer.  Participants will be seated in a specialized chair and leg 
will be strapped to the dynamometer arm.  Participants will also be secured to the 
chair to ensure isolation of the knee joint. Trained staff will instruct participants on how to gradually develop force in one second. Following [ADDRESS_1200458] between contractions. There will be 3 trials of flexions and extension on both legs. Muscular 
strength assessments will be repeated at 1, 6, and 12 months        
 
viii. Physic al Performance Assessment : A series of physical performance 
measurements will be performed to access balance, gait speed , and strength  (74). 
The physical performance  will be repeated at week 12.  
ix. B ody Composition : Participants will be evaluated with dual energy x -ray 
absorptiometry (DEXA, Lunar Prodigy, version 11.2068, Madison, WI) to 
determine fat -free mass, fat mass  and percent body fat at. DEXA uses very low X -
ray doses (0.02mREM) to detect changes in body composition.  DEXA body 
composition will be repeated at week 12.  
x. E xercise Testing : Whole body steady state submaximal O [ADDRESS_1200459] (2.5  mph) to determine VO [ADDRESS_1200460] (Bruce protocol) to 
determine cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] (VO 2 peak) and peak heart rate as previously

 described (13). We will also investigate post exercise oxygen consumption and 
heart rate at 60, 90, 120, and [ADDRESS_1200461] to 
determine if exercise recovery is impacted by [CONTACT_101818].  Blood will be sampled for 
measurement of CK 20- 30 minutes following the maximal exercise to assess 
potential muscle damage.  Exercise testing will be repeated at week 12.  
xi. Cardiovascular Function : These  measures include  both heart rate and stroke  
volume  performed  under  both resting  and sub-maximal  exercise  conditions  
(performed  on separate  days). Stroke volume will be estimated by [CONTACT_861241]  (80). Cardiovascular function will be repeated at week 12.  
xii. P hysical Activity Monitoring : Physical activity levels and sedentary time will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_861242] (BodyMedia Sensewear) (75, 76) for 5 day periods.  Physical activity monitoring will be repeated at week 12.  
xiii. S
tain Therapy Intervention : Once participants have successful completed baseline 
testing, the participant will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups (1:1:1 ratio). Statins  will be prescribed  as a placebo  or at a dosage  of 20 or 80 mg/day  
(atorvastatin;  Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_17133])  by [CONTACT_861243] , [CONTACT_761815],  MD. 
Subjects  and research  team will be blinded to the type and dose of statin.  
Statins  will be dispensed  by [CONTACT_861244]’s  enrollment in the study.  The study  physician  will 
provide  care for any problems  associated  with the statin  treatment  after un-
blinding  by [CONTACT_861245],  [CONTACT_861267].  All doses  fall within  the norms  of recent  recommendations  and are 
given  chronically  (2) 
xiv. A
erobic Exercise Intervention:   Exercise training will be performed as done 
previously (13) and will consist of brisk walking and/or slow jogging on a treadmill 5 d each week at approximately 65 -75% of each subject’s VO2peak, 45 
min/session, at an energy expenditure of 1800 -2000 kcal/wk, for 12 weeks.  The 
exercise training will follow a three -stage progression: 1. wk 1=30 min, 3 d/wk, 
60% VO2max; 2. wk 2=30 min, 5 d/wk, 60% VO2max; and 3. wk 3 -12=45 min, 
5 d/wk, 60- 75% VO2peak. Exercise intensity for each session will be monitored 
using heart rate monitors every [ADDRESS_1200462] four exercise sessions per week w ill be supervised within KUMC exercise facilities.

 F. Risk/benefit assessment:   
a. Potential risks:  
i. Exercise : Some risks are associated with the exercise testing used to assess 
maximal aerobic capacity. Cardiovascular events during maximal exercise and in 
recovery are possible but rare in this population (1). However, these risks could be serious. Therefore, initial screening by [CONTACT_861246] a clinical setting under the direction of a medical monitor (medical monitor only supervises the graded exercise test) . Muscle soreness and strain are possible with 
exercise testing and training, bu t these are not a serious risk.  The maximal 
aerobic capacity test represents greater risk of cardiovascular events than the training exercise because of the increased intensity of the exercise.  However, 
events are extremely rare, and subjects will be screened for risk of cardiovascular disease and symptoms. Emergency equipment, including defibrillator, and ambulance plan  are available for all subjects. Exercise training will be monitored 
by [CONTACT_861247].  
ii. S
tatins : Statin therapy is associated with muscle issues that range from more 
minor issues of muscle pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_861214], to myopathies, to the very severe issues of rhabdomyalgia, although this is rare. Statins are the most prescribed drug in the world. Statins are also associated with headaches, nausea, and constipation. Statins are also not well tolerated by [CONTACT_861248].  Thus, there is the 
potential that participants in our study may have adverse effects while taking 
statins.  A recent trial conducted by [CONTACT_21123], [CONTACT_861268], utilized 80 
mg/day of atorvastatin and found that ~15% of participants experienced pain and weakness (2). atorvastatin 80 mg is an increasingly common dose because three large clinical trials, REVERSAL (atorva 80 v. prava 40, n=502) (3), PROVE IT (atorva 80 v. prava 40, n=4,162) (4), and TNT (atorva 80 v. prava 10, n=10,001) (5) demonstrated reduced atherosclerosis and cardiac events with atorvastatin [ADDRESS_1200463] (>3 times upper 
normal limits [UNL]) and creatinine kinase (CK) elevations (> 10 UNL) occurred in only 1 -3.3% of patients treated with atorvastatin 80 mg for up to 24 months, 
respectively. These side effects should be even more rare given that we will pre-screen and exclude individuals with polymorphisms (GATM and SLC01B1) that increase risk for myopathy.  We will test both muscle enzymes (creatine kinase) 
and liver enzymes (ALT) to determine if statins are causing either muscle myopathies or liver injury.  This testing will occur at baseline and at [ADDRESS_1200464] individuals report that 
 
 
 
KUMC – HRPP- 03/12/[ADDRESS_1200465] would “soldier on” 
simply for the reimbursement.  
iii. Muscle Biopsies: Acute issues of muscle tightness, soreness, and bruising can be 
associated with muscle biopsies.  More severe problems include the risk of 
infection.  To avoid these issues the biopsy procedures are conducted with sterile 
techniques under medical supervision . Moreover, the subjects are given detailed 
instructions including how to take care of the incision site and who to contact [CONTACT_861249].  
iv. I
VGTT Catheter Placement and Venipuncture: Their risk is very minimal. However, 
certain risks including discomfort, blood clot, minor bleeding, bruising, infection, and redness can occur. Aseptic techniques will be used to minimize such risks.  
Risks of bruising and minor pain can occur with venous phlebotomy. Venous 
catheter placements can rarely cause bleeding, bruising, soreness, and infection. Risk of bleeding after removal of the line also is possible. Infusion of glucose or insulin may cause the subject to feel nauseous or flushed. Drinks and snacks will be available for the subjects at the completion of the IVGTT should they have low blood sugar or feel nauseous.  
v. D
EXA : The DEXA scan may make participants slightly uncomfortable because you 
have to hold very still.  This research study involves exposure to radiation equal to  
approximately  the level of  radiation that most Americans receive in about 2 days 
from background radiation, such as naturally occurring radioactivity in the soil and air. The risk from radiation exposures of this magnitude is too small to be 
measured directly and is considered to be very low when compared with other everyday risks.  
b. Potential Benefits: All subjects will gain health information about themselves. At the 
end of the study, results collected will be shared with the subject in face -to-face 
meetings.  Moreover, although we are studying the impact of statins on muscle health, 
statins overall do have a strong track record of lowering blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_861215].  Moreover, the health information gained throughout the 
study will aid the subjects in making future medical decisions with their physicians in relation to cardiovascular and diabetes risk.  The aerobic exercise intervention will 
represent a stimulus for the beginning of a permanent improvement in lifesty le and a 
dramatic reduction in  risk of cardiovascular  disease.  
In summary, the benefits to the subjects are substantial, and the information detailing the impact of statins on mitochondrial, metabolic, and cardiovascular function have the promise of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_861216]. There are risks associated with the study, but the experience and medical expert[INVESTIGATOR_861265] a minimum, and our track record with exercise and diet research indicates that this diligence has been effective.

 G. Location where study will be performed:  All portions of the study will occur at KUMC.  
H. Collaboration: This is a Multi- PI [INVESTIGATOR_861217]. John Thyfault and Darrell Neufer from 
the University of Kansas Medical Center and East Carolina University, respectively. Both 
investigators have been conducting research on statins for several years. The project was 
born out of a common desire to combine their individual expertise to investigate the mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle complications associated with statin therapy in a repeated measures, longitudinal design. Due to the scope of the design (i.e., number of subjects, duration) and complexities of the primary outcome measures, it was felt a multi -PI, 
multi-institutional approach represented the most efficient and statistically valid means of 
completing the project and thereby [CONTACT_861250]. Each investigator has trained at/frequently visited the other institute and is quite familiar with the 
research environments. Standard operating procedures will be developed for all common 
testing and primary outcome measurements, and each investigator and their key personnel will visit the other institute prior to commencing the study to conduct trial runs to insure continuity. The PIs will share responsibility for fiscal and research management. Using the multi-PI [INVESTIGATOR_861218].

 a. Key personnel : John P. Thyfault, PhD, Sandy Billinger, PhD, Darrell Neufer, PhD, John 
Miles, MD, study physician at KUMC and Bruce Ferguson, MD, study physician at ECU.  
b. Plan for safety monitoring and review : [CONTACT_861269] will serve as the 
Chair of the Data Safety Monitoring Board and will convene every [ADDRESS_1200466] access to dose and type of statin and will consult the study physicians/cardiologist to make a decision on whether 
the subject should be removed from the study for safety concerns. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_861219] a subject to subject basis to ensure it is accurate and to address any potential problems that may arise with the protocols. In addition, Drs. Neufer and Thyfault will discuss data at least once per month through in person meetings or by [CONTACT_861251] a consistent manner at both locations. Plan for adverse event reporting : Adverse events will be 
defined as any untoward medical occurrence in study participants or others immediately involved in the performance of the protocol, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study treatment, but results in a change in intervention, daily 
function, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816225] 3 or above using the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0. Expected events such as slight muscle soreness consistent with statin therapy , or those consistent with a 
participant’s prior medical history not sufficient to alter the intervention will not be considered an AE. Staff involved in performance of the protocol (e.g. coordinators) will continually monitor participants for adverse events throughout the intervention, and study staff will assess adverse events at every testing visit as well as during regularly scheduled telephone assessments with all randomized participants.   
If study staff, tester, or participant reports adverse events or complaints, relevant information will be collected and documented.  The participant will be evaluated by [CONTACT_861252]. The investigator will determine the severity (according to the CTCAE) and relatedness of the AE to the intervention.  The 
investigator will identify adverse events of clinical concern, those that may require further workup, or suggest that additional participation in the intervention might be a safety risk.  These AEs will first be discussed with the participant and then communicated 
to the study staff or providers with participant’s consent and as appropriate.  Serious 
adverse events  directly related to study intervention  will be reported immediately to the 
IRB. Any adverse event rate over 30% in [ADDRESS_1200467] Participation  
 
A. Recruitment : 
a. Subjects will be recruited from the KUMC campus, from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_861220] -Kansas City, Kansas and Missouri areas.  Recruiting will occur 
through physicians and clinics and through advertisements in emails, flyers, newspaper 
 
 
 
KUMC – HRPP-  03/12/[ADDRESS_1200468] about the research protocol, compensation, risks, and benefits of taking part in the study.  
b. The targeted/ planned distribution of subjects by [CONTACT_4321]/gender and racial/ethnic groups for 
the proposed study or protocol will follow the local demographics. The Kansas City area 
has a population that is comprised of 13 % African American, 2% Asian, 5% Hispanic, and 80% Caucasian. It is anticipated that the study population at KUMC will have much the same racial and ethnic make -up. Statistical comparisons among minorities or 
between minority and Caucasian groups are not aims of the current study. We fully intend to enroll every eligible minority individual in these studies. Ample pools of all targeted populations exist.  
 
c. Selection criteria: Only premenopausal women will be included in this study because of 
the possible complications that hormone replacement therapy may have upon findings. It 
is anticipated that women will comprise approximately 50% of the study subjects.  It is 
also anticipated that gender will not be a significant factor in the response to exercise training or statin therapy, and hence, it is anticipated that the data from both genders will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_861221] a group.  
 
d. Exclusions:  No minority groups will be excluded.  
 
e. Outreach: The subject pool will be limited to the greater Kansas City (MO and KS) area. 
Subject will need to make regular visits to the laboratories, and thus, subjects will only be recruited who are within the county region and can regularly make appointments.  
 
B. Screening Interview/questionnaire: NA 
 
C. Informed consent process and timing of obtaining of consent : Should the participant 
meet the initial qualifications, they will come to the lab for an informed consent meeting with 
the PI, research coordinator, or other study staff.  They will be provided with an informed 
consent that is fully approved by [CONTACT_861253] -person meeting. 
Subjects who are interested in taking part in the study will be asked to sign the informed 
consent in the presence of a witness. Participants will have adequate opportunity to review the informed consent and to ask any questions they may have about the research protocol, compensation, risks, and benefits of taking part in the study.  
D. Alternatives to Participation : NA 
 
 
 
 
KUMC – HRPP-  03/12/[ADDRESS_1200469] s: There is no cost to subjects for participation in this study.  
 
F. How new information will be conveyed to the study subject and how it will be 
documented : New information about risks associated with involvement in the study will be 
disseminated but no other information will be disclosed.  
 
G. Payment, including a prorated plan for payment : Participants will receive  a one -time 
compensation of $400  for completing all study  visits. If participation en ds early, participants will 
receive $[ADDRESS_1200470] and the Internal Revenue Service if your payments are $600 or more in a calendar year. The subjects’ personal information will be kept on a secure computer. It will be removed from the computer after the study is over and the money on the card has been used. The information will not be shared with other businesses. It will be kept confidential.  
 
H. Payment for a research -related injury : We will include the following text in the consent 
form:  “All forms of medical findings, whether routine or experimental, involve some risk of 
injury.  In spi[INVESTIGATOR_31246], you might develop medical problems from 
participating in this study.  You must report any suspected illness or injury to the study 
coordinator immediately.  If such problems occur, you will be provided with emergency 
medical treatment and the investigator will assist you in getting proper follow -up medical 
treatment.  Neither the investigator nor the sponsor will provide compensation for research -
related injuries.  Payment of lost wages, disability or discomfort is not available.  You do not 
give up any of your rights by [CONTACT_3368].”   
 
IV. Data Collection and Protection  
A. Data Management and Security : All identifiable files, data, and tissue will be coded and 
stored in secure locations.  These data include:  study progression, subject numbers, percent 
completion, data quality, subject retention, adverse events, etc.  
The PIs at both KUMC and ECU will be responsible for the quality of the data and will supervise the data  acquisition with the help of study coordinators. All data will be coded for 
confidentiality, and only the PI, study coordinator, and study statistician will have access to the code. The results of each test on each subject will be screened by [CONTACT_861254]. This is standard practice in our laboratories. Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_861222]. Coded data  files will be sent to the study 
statistician for statistical analyses. These analyses will be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_861223]- Is. At the end of participation in the study, 
each subject will receive a personal data summary of their test results. The study coordinator or a study investigator will discuss the results with the subject.  
After 1 year, the PI’s including the biostatistician, [CONTACT_861270] will be un -blinded but the 
study staff will remain blinded, so that the important research findings can begin to be 
 
 
 
KUMC – HRPP-  03/12/[ADDRESS_1200471]. He to being to examine if the trial is finding more or 
less significant effects for outcome measures.   
 
B. Sample / Specimen Collection: All subjects will be assigned a data code. Blood and tissue 
samples will be labeled with the participant’s data code and stored in a locked freezer. Blood and tissue samples will be stored indefinitely following completion of current project for future research.   
 
C. Tissue Banking Considerations: Following completion  of the current project, remaining 
blood and tissue samples will remain in locked freezer indefinitely . Samples will only be used 
by [CONTACT_861255], both KUMC and ECU, when a new biomarkers or 
techniques of interest emerge.   
 
D. Procedures to protect subject confidentiality : Risks to confidentiality are reduced by 
[CONTACT_861256] a data code. Folders are stored in locked file cabinets, and only the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_861224]. Individual names or initials are not used in any discussions or publications of the data.  
 
E. Quality Assurance / Monitoring : Data will be reviewed twice a year by [CONTACT_861257]. 
In addition, data will be reviewed on a yearly basis with the biostatistician, [CONTACT_861271] to 
determine if the studies should be shortened do to either no measured effect or due to 
effects that are greater than what power calculations indicated. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_861225] a subject to subject basis to ensure it is accurate and to address any potential problems that may  arise with the protocols. In 
addition, Drs. Neufer and Thyfault will discuss data at least once per month through in person meetings or by [CONTACT_861251] a consistent manner at both locations.  
 
 
V. Data Analysis and Reporting  
 
A. Statistical and Data Analysis:  This project is a two -factor study. One factor is treatment 
group (between subjects) and a second factor is time of data collection (0, 1, 6, and 12 months) (within subject). The data analysis will be carried out for the primary outcome variable of cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863], in addition to other outcome variables ( muscle 
mitochondrial change,  and insulin sensitivity, etc.). For each measure, its baseline measure 
and age will be added as covariates to adjust for the individual difference at baseline. Two -
way interaction between treatment and time will be added in the model for testing if the outcome changes differently between groups over time. Additional variables, such as 
demographics, BMI, physical activity, etc. may also be included as covariates. If the test of 
trend difference is significant,  then the comparison  at each time point will also be considered  
to identify  when  the difference between groups  reaches the maximum. Least Square Means 
will be used for the aforementioned comparisons. The statistical analysis will be performed with mixed procedure in STATA 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Mixed model does 
 
 
 
KUMC – HRPP-  03/12/2015   Page 18 of 25
  
 
 
 not require complete data for a longitudinal study. Residual analyses will be conducted and 
efforts to address those will be made, including appropriate transformations.  
 
B. Expected Outcome s: The EX+Plac group and EX+Atorva20 groups will have a significant 
increase in VO2peak, stroke volume, and a lowering of resting heart rate, common responses to exercise  training. Measures of mitochondrial content (citrate synthase) and 
function (in- vivo NIRS, and ex -vivo respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) will improve following the intervention, and 
will be preceded by [CONTACT_861258] (PGC -1α, NRF -1, NRF -2, mTFA) known 
to control mitochondrial biogenesis measured at 1 month. Insulin sensitivity will also improve in the EX+Plac and Ex+Atorva20 groups. In contrast, the EX+Atorva80 group will display diminished mitochondrial and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_861226].  This may occur 
due to a blunted exercise induced increase in PGC -1α which is known to up regulate anti -
ROS defense enzymes (101). Other cardiovascular adaptations may not improve in the 
EX+Atorva80 group, which could be due to impaired mitochondria oxygen consumption. We expect measures of pain and function to be triggered by [CONTACT_861259]80 treatment. These findings would indicate that higher dose atorvastatin impair exercise adaptations and that physicians should consider prescribing lower dose atorvastatin to patients who plan to utilize exercise training to lower cardiovascular risk. If these findings occur we will have remaining tissues to examine further mechanisms including if these 
findings are associated with reduced cellular  ubiquinone  levels,  and altered balance between 
pathways controlling autophagy and apoptosis (Bcl -2 and Bax). These can  be further 
supported by [CONTACT_861260]. Given that a rodent study showed atorvastatin therapy blocked exercise induced increases in Glut4 mRNA and glycogen content (102), and that mitochondrial adaptations are critical for improved insulin sensitivity, we expect the EX+Atorva group will also display impaired improvements in insulin sensitivity.  
 
C. Study results to participants : At the end of participation in the study, each subject will 
receive a personal data summary of their test results. The study coordinator or a study investigator will discuss the results with the subject.  Results to be shared include: Body 
composition, exercise testing results,  lipid profile,  liver function (ALT), and glucose  and 
insulin results from IVGTT,  and summary of physical activity levels.   
 
D. Publication Plan : We will publish all data derived from this award in a timely fashion and to 
make those data freely available to the general research community whenever possible. All 
genomic data will be made publicly available through NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO), and all publications that result from this work will be deposited in PubMed Central (PMC).

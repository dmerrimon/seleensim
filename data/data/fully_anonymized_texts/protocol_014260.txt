(also known as slow wave activity) of posterior cortex (overlying the precuneus brain region) and  the 
functional and effective connectivity between brain regions as indicated by [CONTACT_531280].  The result s of this study will help to identify the 
neurophysiological correlates of changes in conscious experience that occur during drug -induced 
sedation informing clinical practice of sedation and anesthesiology as well as consciousness science.  
 
The study will employ auditory stimuli and high -density electroencephalography (HD -EEG) in 
combination. We hypothesize that consciousness during sedation will be associated with lower delta 
power at the CPz electrode than unconsciousness .  HD-EEG allows non -invasive reco rding and mappi[INVESTIGATOR_531250]. Transmission of signals within the brain will be evaluated in normal subjects by

states of sedation i.e., wakefuln ess, responsive sedation, and unresponsive sedation.  Sedation will be 
induced with FDA -approved, clinical sedatives, dexmedetomidine, ketamine , midazolam  and propofol . 
All these drugs have distinct mechanisms of action. We will study 20 patients for each drug.  Hence 60 
subjects will be recruited in total.  We will compare these responses from those obtained from natural 
sleep with sleep data acquired at the Wisconsin Psychiatric Institute and Clinics  (WISPIC) . 
 
We have previously shown that midazolam,  a short -acting benozodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_531251]. Herein we seek to develop these same 
findings through out the study of the other sedative drugs.  In the proposed doses, there is a very small 
risk of prolonged sedation and loss of airway control. All drugs will be administered by [CONTACT_531282]. The sedative drugs (dexmedetomidine, 
ketamine,  midazolam  and propofol) have very low all ergic potential.

1.1. Background  
‘Consciousness’ is synonymous with ‘subjective experience’: it can be summarized as “what abandons us 
every night when we fall into dreamless sleep and returns the next morning when we wake up or when 
we dream.” Similarly, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_531252] (though they sometimes also report dreams). It is evident that sleep and anesthesia are 
not the same. But, they do share certain behavioral features, such as unresponsiveness and loss of 
muscula r tone. They also share a number of neurophysiological characteristics, including EEG slowing 
and synchronization, characteristic events such as “K -complexes” and “spi[INVESTIGATOR_36874]”, and partially 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_531253] m icroelectrode and imaging methods. 
Although there are similarities, there are also several notable differences between sleep and anesthesia. 
For example, whereas sleep may be interrupted by a noxious stimulus or even a loud noise, anesthesia – 
at clinical doses - survives these challenges. Does this mean that the unconscious state produced by 
[CONTACT_531283]? This is one of the fundamental questions we will 
address.  
 
Anesthetics appear to produce a reversible state of uncon sciousness accompanied by [CONTACT_531284]1. This 
remarkable phenomenon brings great relief to surgical patients and wonder to clinicians and scientists. 
However consciousness also occurs during anesthesia: dreaming is  common under clinical conditions 
(33% of patie nts) and in laboratory st udies (up to 80% of subjects2) but subjects typi[INVESTIGATOR_395166] 
“disconnected” from their environment (ie. they may be in a dream -state, unaware of their environment 
and the external sensor y world)1. This complex pharmacological state mirrors that of sleep but to date, 
we do not fully understand the mechanisms by [CONTACT_531285]. Nor do we have a deep understanding of consciousness itself or how to measure it – a 
shortcoming that hinders progress in the newly emerging science of consciousness, and has prevented 
the development of an effective diagnostic tool or monitor that can be applied in clinical settings.  
 
The intense interest in “depth -of-anesthesia” monitors demonstrates its perceived importance among 
practicing clinicians. Just as monitors of cardio -respi [INVESTIGATOR_531254], a reliable monitor of consciousness has the potential to reduce the incidence of awareness with 
recall, which remains unacceptably high (up to 0.2%) and can lead to adverse psychological sequelae, 
such as symptoms of  post -traumatic stress disorder . At the same time, there is a concern that many 
patients may be “overdosed” in an attempt to m inimize awareness with recall . 
 
Current approaches to measuring depth -of-anesthesia suffer from significant inter -patient var iability in 
response properties . They also lack predictive power: although valid on average, they fail too often to 
report the level of consc iousness in individual patients1. We suggest that an approach based on a 
fundamental understanding of consciousness is an essential path to identifying a universally applicable 
measure that can be used to guide drug administration in  the perioperative setting.  
 
Understanding how we may be conscious  under anesthesia  but unaware of our environment (sensory 
disconnection) is also critical1. Sanders et al. have discussed , achieving sensory disconnection appears 
desirable in anesthesia but may fail in approximately 37% of cases1. Our ConsCIOUS study (IRB: Bauer 
(PI) 2014: 1558) has shown that 4.6% of patients are aware of their environment following intubation 
under general anesthesia . Presently we lack a marker of disconnection that provides confidence that 
sensory stimuli will not trigger a conscious experience. Such a marker would have clinical utility to 
identify patients at risk of anesthesia awareness.  As discussed above, dreami ng (disconnected 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page 7 of 52 consciousness) is  c ommon under clinical anesthesia . A depth of anesthesia monitor that detected 
internally -triggered dreaming (with sensory disconnection from surgery) would signal to the 
anesthesiologist to unnecessarily deepen the anest hetic state increasing the risk of the side effects of 
anesthesia. A marker of disconnection would have significant clinical utility to signify the lack of 
perception of surgery. Any insights afforded into the mechanisms of disconnection could lead to 
deve lopments of improved anesthesia or sedation in the critical care unit as well as development of 
further sleep aids for use in the community.  
 
Patterns of brain activity during anesthesia can be recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). EEG 
reflects the electrical activity of the brain, and is characterized by [CONTACT_531286], 
including slow waves and spi[INVESTIGATOR_36874]. A more complete understanding of these patterns will elucidate both 
normal brain function, and alterations in these patterns may be sensitive indicators of disrupted brain 
function in disorders of brain function. This aim will be supported by [CONTACT_531287]: dexmedetomidine (an alpha2 adrenergic agonist), propofol  and 
midazolam (GABAm imetic s), and ketamine (NMDA antagonist ). While midazolam and propofol both 
affect GABAA receptor function, midazolam targets synaptic (benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_531255]) while 
propofol also targets extrasynaptic channels (and HCN -1 channels in addition). These differences 
necessitate individual studies of those drugs. We will study the EEG correlates of conscious experience 
and lack of conscious experience under sedation. In order to obtain report of consciousness, we will 
wake patients from the sedated st ate and ask them questions to gain insights into the experience – if 
any – they were having at the time.  We will compare the responses obtained during sedation with those 
collected during natural sleep . We will test whether EEG responses during sleep corre late with changes 
during sedation. In the future we envision that sleep data can be used to develop personalized 
thresholds for an EEG consciousness monitor  to be used during sedation and anesthesia  and we will test 
this proposal in a subsequent application based on the data acquired herein.  
 
We will also test  the cognitive state when aroused from sedation that we expect will be associated with 
impaired feedback processing in the brain and therefore  disturbed predictive coding3. We have recently 
shown that feedback connections are particularly susceptible to sub -anesthetic concentrations of d rugs4 
and we will therefore te st whether cognitive processes that depend on feedback processing, particularly 
those dependent on predictive coding3, are affected during sedatio n. We will then titrate the anesthetic 
to a state of unresponsiveness to v erbal command and repeat the experiment  (but not the predictive 
coding tasks requiring the subject to respond) .  
 
Our laboratory has pi[INVESTIGATOR_531256], particularly in advancing the use of high -density EEG 
(HD-EEG) in the study of sleep, especially in combination with transcranial magnetic stimulation – a non -
invasive method for stimulating specific brain regi ons and auditory stimuli (IRB: Tononi (PI) 2013 -0019). 
We have successfully and safely used this technology during HD -EEG during sleep and anesthesia5 (IRB: 
Pearce (PI) 2008 -0018). The combination of HD -EEG,  and auditory stimuli, will provide novel insights 
into EEG and connectivity changes in the brain under varying depths of anesthesia.   
 
 
1.2. Rationale and hypothesis  
This study will be a single -site, controlled, unblinded study at the University of Wisconsin to examine 
changes in  posterior cortical delta power of the HD -EEG during anesthesia and waking. We hypothesize 
that sedation, with different agents, will increase posterior cortical delta power, interrupting the  
conscious experience,  testing this using several anesthetic drugs.  
 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page 8 of 52 We will apply high -density electroencephalography (HD -EEG) to assess waking and anesthetized brain 
activity in response to non -invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as auditory  stimulation.  
 
2. Objectives

UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page [ADDRESS_689833] data in 
wakefulness, light sedation and deep sedation. The primary outcome focuses on light sedation during 
which data will be collected divided on conscious experience present/absent.  
 
We will study four different sedatives that have diff erent mechanisms of action, to provide a cross 
section of the drugs used in clinical practice and provide greater insight into the mechanisms through 
which consciousness may be perturbed.  We will recruit [ADDRESS_689834] to titrate to consciousness/unconsciousness.  Drugs will be administered , on 
separate days,  in the order of dexmedetomidine, ketamine , midazolam  and propofol .

used in study procedures has been evaluated and approved by [CONTACT_531290] 
(clinical) applications. As all proce dures are considered “research”, they do not require specific approval 
by [CONTACT_531291], as long as subjects are informed of the nature of the study, and all devices are 
clearly labeled “WARNING - For Investigational Use”. However, most of the equi pment used in this study 
has an FDA approval for clinical use AND/OR an FDA 510(k) pre -market clearance. A summary of FDA 
approvals of equipment is detailed below:  
 
Electroencephalography equipment:  Most EEG equipment has been “grandfathered” by [CONTACT_1622], a s it 
has been used in clinical settings prior to the [ADDRESS_689836] part, substantially equivalent and maintain this 
exemption.   
 
High -density (HD) EEG equipment  is identical in concept to previously existing EEG equipment. However, 
HD-EEG has many more individual electrodes placed across the scalp to allow superior spatial and 
temporal resolution in the analysis of the EEG signals. Analysis of HD -EEG data has become practical only 
with the advent and improvement of powerful personal computers. High -density EEG systems have 
been in use since at least the early 1990’s, and do not require FDA approval for research use. However, 
more recently some HD -EEG systems (electrod e caps, amplifiers, recording software) have received  FDA 
510(k) pre -market approval, as these companies intend to market their products for commercial clinical 
use. In addition to HD -EEG systems, multiple sensor systems used for clinical polysomnography 
(integrated systems incorporating EEG, respi[INVESTIGATOR_42766], movement monitoring, etc. along with 
amplifier and recording/analysis software) also have 510(k) clearance.  
 
The following systems have FDA 510(k) approval:  
- Electrical Geodesics Inc., hydrocel geodesic sensor net (HCGSN) hd -EEG system (64 -, 128 -, and 256 -
electrode systems). (http://www.egi.com)  
- Philips -Respi[INVESTIGATOR_531258] 
(http://www.healthcare.philips.com/main/homehealth/sleep/alice5 /default.wpd - current vendor for 
Wisconsin Sleep Center although other systems from Nihon -Koden, Compumedics, ViaSys, etc. may 
potentially be used in the future)  
 
The following systems do not have FDA 510(k) approval:  
- BrainAmp, BrainAmp MR Plus MRI comp atible high density EEG system. 
(http://www.brainproducts.com/products/brainampmrplus/).  
- NexStim Eximia EEG system (http://www.nexstim.com/index.php?k=[ZIP_CODE])  
 
These systems are designed and marketed exclusively for research applications, and as such do not 
require FDA approval. However, these devices are not substantially different than the other EEG 
systems, and are still considered NSR devices. Wireless EEG systems may also be used. These systems 
consists of battery powered EEG amplifiers that are not directly plugged into the power mains. Several 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page 12 of 52 wireless EEG devices are commercially available. The wireless EEG device currently used for research in 
the laboratory and approved for use in protocol H2009 -0052 was specifically designed for sleep 
according to ANSI/AAMI ES1 -1985 guidelines for “Safe current limits for electro -medical apparatus” and 
safety standards for wireless communications according to the Radio and Telecommunications Terminal 
Equipment directives by [CONTACT_531292].  
   
Audit ory Stimulation:  Devices that produce evoked auditory stimuli (an EEG response from an auditory 
stimulus) are described in 21CFR882.1900 as a Class II device (exempt from pre -market notification 
[510(k) clearance). Auditory stimuli will be produced on a st andard personal computer through 
commonly available media software (e.g. – Windows Media Player, iTunes, etc.) and played back 
through standard commercially available small speakers or earphones connected to the computer. 
Volume of playback will be estimat ed before experiments using a decibel meter, and are maintained 
below 80dB (“low” volume range, corresponds to a speaking voice level). Volume will kept at the lowest 
level that still produces an auditory evoked potential (an EEG signal in response to hear ing a sound). It is 
critical to keep the volume as low as possible as louder sounds could awaken a subject and disrupt the 
experiment.   
 
GE Clinical anesthesia machine : monitoring and full resuscitation equipment consistent with American 
Society of Anesthesiologists and UW -Madison guidance with FDA approval. Studies conducted in the

EZstim II nerve stimulator, model es400, Life Tech has 510k clearance  to provide tetanic stimuli to assess 
neuromuscular function and is routinely used in clinical anesthesia.  
 
Predictive coding t ask. We have designed a behavioral task in which subjects use prior auditory 
information to process visual information. This task uses biomorphic visual stimuli from Michael Tarr’s 
lab, known as greebles (http://wiki.cnbc.cmu.edu/Novel_Objects). Greebles w ill either be colored or gray -
scale images. Each greeble is personified with a name. For example, the violet, green and yellow greebles 
shown in figure [ADDRESS_689837] learn two or three pairs of name [CONTACT_531323] s through trial and error (images 
and their names are randomly assigned each session) . This phase is called the learning phase, and it will 
take place before the administration of anesthetic agents . Subjects will hear a name [CONTACT_531324] [CONTACT_531293] a visual image of a greeble on the monitor. Auditory feedback on correct and 
incorrect responses provided at the end of each trial. To confirm that subjects have learnt the correct 
associations , subjects perform a match/non -match task (figure 2A). Subjects report whether the auditory -
visual pairs matched or not using a button response device (keyboard, mouse or button box). The buttons 
signaling a match and non -match on each trial are respective ly indicated by a star (or check) and null (or 
cross) symbol on the monitor (after the presentation of the greeble image). The appropriate button 
changes randomly over trials to minimize motor preparation (on half the trials, the left button will signal 
a match, and on the other half, the right button will signal a match). To allow measuring of reaction times, 
we will also use a variant of the task shown in figure 2, in which the second delay period (after the greeble 
image) is absent.

Figure 1  (left). Stimuli used in the behavioral 
task. To avoid differences in salience of 
stimuli, greeble images have similar size, 
number of extensions and contrast, and 
greeble names have the same number of 
syllables, start with a ‘hard’ consonant and 
end with a vowel.   
  

UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page 14 of 52 Figure 2  (below). Task design. A1, A2 and A3 are computer -voiced names Paluti, Kagotu and Tilado. V1, 
V2 and V3 are greeble images. Star=match; null sign =non -match; screen position indicates left/right 
button.  
 
 
Once subjects demonstrate g reater than 80% accuracy in the match/non -match task during the learning 
phase, they progress to the testing phase (figure 2B -D). In this phase, which will occur during baseline 
recordings, the administration of anesthetic agents  (prior to loss of consciousness),  and during recovery  
we manipulate predictions by [CONTACT_531294] a greeble visual image appearing after its 
associated auditory name. For example, whenever subjects hear the name [CONTACT_531325], there will be an 85% 
chance of Paluti’s image being shown; whenever subjects hear the name [CONTACT_531326], there will be a 50% 
chance of Kagotu’s image being shown; and whenever subjects hear the name [CONTACT_531327], there will be a 33% 
chance of Tilado’s image being shown. In an individual ex perimental session, there will be roughly equal 
numbers of match and non -match trials, to avoid response bias. In addition, there will be approximately 
equal numbers of Paluti, Kagotu and Tilado images, and their corresponding names will have similar 
proba bility of being presented as the auditory cue, to control for stimulus familiarity.  
To test how precision (or the reliability of sensory information) is represented, in some cases, we may 
introduce two conditions during the predictive coding testing phase. These are high noise and low noise 
conditions. White noise will be added to the gre eble images to manipulate perceptual confidence.  
To rule out the possibility that expectation of a match or non -match in itself may contribute to subjects’ 
responses, we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a variant of the predictive coding task in which half of trials subjects s imply 
respond to the color of the visual image (or, in the case of gray -scale images, whether the image is upright 

UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page 15 of 52 or inverted) rather than whether the auditory name [CONTACT_531328]. In this 
behavioral pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], the second delay period (a fter the greeble image) is absent, to allow measuring of 
reaction times. Further, on the half of trials in which subjects simply respond to the color of the visual 
image (or, in the case of gray -scale images, whether the image is upright or inverted), a co lored swatch 
(or, for gray -scale images, and up/down arrow) on each side of the fixation point replace the star and null 
symbols at the end of the trial (see figure 3). Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_531259] a match or 
non-match in itself contri bute little to subjects’ responses.   
 
Most of this experimental phase is conducted prior to sedation commencing with the testing phase that 
will take  approximately  [ADDRESS_689838] been asked (equivalent 
to OAAS scale 4 -5) and then the subject will be allowed to return to sleep. The duration of sedation will 
not be extended for this experimental addition. Patients will be asked to perform the [ADDRESS_689839] but as they get more sedated this is not possible. 
Therefore we will also apply a passive tasks  as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_1427] y that involves passive  audio -visual integration 
where in addition to a tone , a paired visual stimulus is provided  (for example a pi[INVESTIGATOR_531260] a face is provided)  
on the computer screen . Each tone and/or face is provided as a 250ms stimulus. The tone will be provided 
through the headphones as above and the face will be displayed on a computer screen as per 6. Fifteen 
minutes of data will be acquired using this paradigm under sedation. The paired visual and auditory 
stimulus produces an integrated evoked response  [AV]. The interaction of the responses can be calculated 
by [CONTACT_531295] (V) or auditory cue (A) i.e. (AV – (A+V)) which 
we call the AV interaction. We will model how sedation affects  the AV interaction response hyp othesizing 
that during states of disconnection or unconsciousness the AV interaction will disappear.  
 
Cognitive Tests:  To better understand what areas of cognition are affected by [CONTACT_77147], participants 
may also complete a flanker task, verbal fluency task, and Wisconsin card -sorting task. Participants would 
complete these tasks during the HD -EEG recording. To obtain baseline cognition, these tasks will be 
completed before the start of sedation. They will also be completed during the lighter sed ation period. 
Similar to the Predictive Coding task, once participants reach a deeper level of sedation, they will be 
unable to perform these tasks so they will only be done when the patient is still conscious.  Subjects will  be 
asked to complete them again  during recovery in the CRU , taking approximately [ADDRESS_689840] of attention , executive control, and inhibition. For this task, participants are 
instructed to focus on a central, directional,  target stimulus such as an arrow .  The target stimulus will be 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page [ADDRESS_689841]. The letters they will be 
presented with are “F,” “A,” “S,” and “T”.  
The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task tests executive function and cogni tive flexibility. For this task images are 
presented that vary along different dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Participants are then instructed to 
sort the images along one of the dimensions. During switch trials, the dimension in which the participant  
is asked to sort changes. Their ability to quickly and accurately switch between dimensions is considered 
a measure of cognitive flexibility . 
 
Auditory Stimuli:  
 
Oddball Paradigm:   
We will use the “roving” oddball paradigm that our collaborator, [CONTACT_531330] (UW -Madison, Neurology) 
used previously to study brain -damaged patients with altered levels of consciousness7 (Fig. 1) and that 
[CONTACT_219713] (UW -Madison, Psychiatry) is investigating in sleepi [INVESTIGATOR_40675]. This paradigm has been well 
studied in other volunteer settings but not  specifically  in anesthesia. The stimuli comprise a structured 
sequence of pure sinusoidal tones. The loudness of the tones will be set in each subject to a comfortable 
level, which will be maintained throughout the experiment. Within each stimulus train, all tones are  of 
one frequency and are followed by a train of a different frequency. The first tone of a train is a deviant, 
which becomes a standard after several repetitions. This paradigm ensures that deviant tones and 
standard tones have exactly the same physical p roperties, differing only in the number of times they 
have been presented, which is varied pseudo -randomly between one and eleven. The frequency of the 
tones will vary from 500 to 800 Hz, in randomly selected integer multiples of 50 Hz. Stimuli will be 
presented binaurally via headphones for 20 minutes during wakefulness. The duration of each tone will 
be 70 ms and the inter -stimulus interval is 500 ms. 200 “standard sets” ranging from 1 -11 tones/set 
(also resulting in 300 deviant tones) will be presented t o each subject in each condition.  
 
Local/Global Deviant Paradigm : 
Experimental stimuli are vowels /a/ and /i/, presented in a local global deviant paradigm (Bekinschtein 
et al., [ZIP_CODE]; Fig. 1). The vowels were excised from the steady -state vowel portions of consonant -vowel 
stimuli /had/ and /hid/, spoken by a female talker ( F0 = 232 Hz and 233 Hz, respec tively) (Hillenbrand et 
al., 1995). On each trial, five 100 ms vowels, normalized to the same root -mean -square amplitude, gated 
with 5 ms on/off ramps and separated by [ADDRESS_689842] four or different (Fig. 1a). This difference constituted the local 
deviance: /aaaaa/ and /iiiii/ trials were local standards, while /aaaai/ and /iiiia/ trials were local 
deviants.

Figure 1. Local global deviant experimental paradigm. a: Schematic of the four experimental stimuli. b: 
Stimulus sequences. c: Comparisons between trials to characterize local and global deviance effect.  
 
The intertrial interval will be varied within a Gaussian distribution (onset -to-onset mean 1500 ms, S.D. = 
10 ms) to reduce heterodyning in the recordings secondary to power line noise. In each block, the 
stimuli were presented in four sequences, with the order of the sequences randomized across blocks 
(Fig. 1b). Each sequence will begin with a recorded instruct ion that defined the task and the target 
stimulus to the subject, e.g., for Sequence 1: “This time, press the button when you hear this sound: 
/aaaai/. Once again, press the button when you hear this sound: /aaaai/.” This will be followed by a 
sequence of [ADDRESS_689843] trials 
and 18 global deviant trials, presented in a pseudorandom order. The difference in presentation 
frequency thus constituted the global deviance, and the identity of the global deviant changed across 
the four sequences within each block. The duration of each block is 11 minutes (400 1.5 s trials and four 
15-second instruction segments); this will be paused during wake ups.  Stimuli will be delivered to both 
ears via insert earphones that were integrated into custom -fit earmolds. Acoustic stimulation will be 
performed at a comfortable level, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [ADDRESS_689844]. Subjects will be instructed to report detection 
of the target stimuli (i.e. global deviants) by a button press if they are awake.

Paradigm : 
For encoding, subjects will be presented [ADDRESS_689846] A or B.  
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page 19 of 52  
Memory will be assessed and analyzed using the two -alternative forced choice (2AFC) signal detection 
method in the CRU . Here, the subjects are presented with a pair of words; one is a target word, and the 
other is a foil. The subjects are asked to select t he word that seems more familiar, or otherwise to choose 
randomly. The following methods are applied to minimize sources of bias: (1) 2AFC word pairs are 
balanced for linguistic characteristics of valence, arousal, dominance, frequency, and syllables1 2, and 
avoidance of semantic or phonemic similarity across pairs; (2) Alternate versions of the command 
sequence are created to balance the word used as the target and that as the foil, and applied randomly; 
(3) To avoid position effects in the 2AFC pairing, a lternate versions of the retrieval list are created, and 
applied randomly.  
 
Limitations : 
The 2AFC method is a sensitive, but not specific assessment of implicit memory. Any explicit memory trace 
will also influence the discrimination of target words. This limitation is acceptable because: (1) There is a 
sound a priori hypothesis that explicit memory will be absent or rare during sedation/anesthesia; (2) In 
the context of anesthetic patients who report no spontaneous recollection, the existence of any memory  
behavior that represents performance above chance is of interest and significance; (3) Alternate methods 
that are specific to implicit memory are less robust with the limited number of patients and words 
possible, and are also less resilient to cultural l inguistic heterogeneity.

Tetanic Stimulus:  
In deeply sedated individuals (OAA/S 1), we will apply a tetanic stimulus for 10s at 50Hz 50mAmp to the 
forearm using a clinical nerve stimulator (EZstim II, model es400, Life Tech). Peripheral nerve stimulation 
is routinely used on emergence from anesthesia to monitor return of muscle function. It is a moderately 
painful stimulus and hence we will not conduct it in wakeful individuals. However it has been used to 
assess rousability during anesthesia previously9. 
 
Video Recording:  
Participants will be video recorded during the duration of each sedation appointment to ensure quality 
of research and to aid in analysis  of the timing  events following sedation.  A written copy of the 
recordings will be made for use in the research.  Video recordings will be s tored in a secure departmental 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page [ADDRESS_689848] sedative  session  will 
be dexmedetomidine  followed by [CONTACT_113883] , propofol  (dependent on the availability of the drugs)  and 
then midazolam . Allocation is not randomized to ensure that dexmedetomidine, the drug that is easiest 
to titrate, is administered first.  Hence we will recruit [ADDRESS_689849] i dentification  
Subjects will be recruited via advertisements ( mass email distribution ). All advertising materials will be 
submitted to the IRB for approval . Potential subjects may respond to advertisements via phone to study 
staff.  
 
 
6.2. Screening  
Subjects will respond to the volunteer posts for the study by [CONTACT_531296] a study specific phone number. 
They will complete  a phone screening to determine basic eligibility for the study. If they qualify, the 
volunteer will be asked to come into UWHC for an in person meeting with a F aculty anesthesiologist and 
consented, followed by a  basic pre -anesthesia exam  to confirm they are healthy and safe enough to take 
part in the study.   The Faculty anesthesiologist will confirm with the subject that the study could kill 
them and there is no direct benefit to the subject.  
 
6.3. Recruitment  and con sent  
The subject will meet with a staff anesthesiologist in a private room. The subject will undergo informed 
consent discussion for the study where the risks of anesthesia , and the study procedures  are explained 
by [CONTACT_15374]. Participants will be offered informational handouts on the sedative drugs. Undue 
coercion will be prevented by [CONTACT_531297] t he potential subject will not change regardless of the decision about 
participation.   
 
7. Activities and measurements  
 
Screening  & Baseline:   
An informed consent discussion, reviewing the risks of participation, eligibility, and data collection will 
be completed at this visit. All questions from the potential subjects will be answered at this visit. If 
consent is provided and criteria for inclus ion are met, a history and physical, neurologic and 
anesthesiologic examinations for candidacy will be performed (assessment of a normal airway and 
adequate venous access ).  Vital sign s will be measured and a review of concomitant medications will be 
perfo rmed.  
 
 
Sleep Study Protocol:  
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page 22 of 52  
This protocol mirrors IRB approved protocol ( 2013 -0019 ; PI [INVESTIGATOR_531261]) . Subjects will be reimbursed 
$[ADDRESS_689850] an “accommodation” night in the sleep lab, or 
will be able to use a “demo” hd -EEG net at home prior to the sleep lab record ing. 
 
Accomodation night:  Subjects will have sleep hd -EEG recordings on two nights. The first night 
will be an “accommodation” night and the second will be considered the baseline recording. 
Procedures and recording equipment will be the same between the t wo nights.  
 
“Demo” hd -EEG nets:  Another option to allow accommodation to the EEG net is the use of a 
“demo” net. The demo nets have the identical appearance and shape of the recording hd -EEG 
nets (supplied by [CONTACT_491162], Inc.). However, instead o f recording electrodes, the net 
has only the plastic/rubber electrode housing, and also does not include the wires/cables 
necessary for recording. These do not require conductive gel and can be worn by [CONTACT_531298]. Because they do not require any se tup or other hardware, the demo nets can be used 
by a subject at home. Subjects will come to the lab for an instructional session (about 15 -20 
minutes) to learn how to put on and care for the net. Subjects will then be allowed to take the net 
home and use it while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_48908] [ADDRESS_689851] comfort and accommodation to the recording net prior  to the laboratory 
session.  Nets that were previously used as recording nets but are no longer functional may also 
be used as “demo” nets.  
 
EEG is a non -invasive technique commonly used both in research and clinical settings to 
measure electrical activity in the brain. We will record hd -EEG while subjects are awake and 
asleep to have recordings for both states. Baseline recordings will be compared to recordings 
during other experimental procedures. The sleep hd -EEG recordings will be performed in a 
manner c omparable to clinical polysomnography (PSG). The consent will instruct subjects that 
the PSG should not be considered to be a substitute for a clinical study ordered by [CONTACT_153155]. Interpretation of PSG data will be supervised by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Plante , a board -certified Sleep 
Medicine Specialist. Subjects will be informed of any identified sleep disorders, and assistance 
will be given with referrals for appropriate medical followup.  
 
In addition to the hd -EEG net, there will be additional electrodes/sensors to mo nitor other 
physiologic activity during sleep including:  
Electrodes at the corner of each eye to monitor eye movements.  
Electrode on the chin to measure muscle activity.  
Low-resolution video recording using an infrared camera to allow assessment of sleep/w ake 
state, sleep -related movements, assist with sleep scoring of the EEG record, and to allow real -
time monitoring of subjects. In addition to providing important information for assessing sleep, 
video monitoring provides additional subject safety by [CONTACT_531299].  
 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page 23 of 52 The actigraph is a small device (about the size of a postage stamp) worn like a watch. The device 
registers movement, and is used to estimate how many hours a subject sleeps (e.g. – when the y 
are not moving). Actigraphs are FDA approved for use in clinical sleep labs. There is no 
foreseeable risk associated with wearing this small recording unit. The actigraphic recording will 
be used to confirm daily (circadian) patterns of activity/sleep, i n conjunction with subject report 
on the Sleep Diary form.  
 
After baseline waking recordings, a sleep EEG will be recorded for the subjects’ entire night of 
sleep. The experiment will be scheduled so subjects lie down and try to fall asleep within [ADDRESS_689852] activity power in natural sleep. After this period, The wake up procedure will be followed 
with wake ups approximately every 15 -30 minutes as per our prior work with the same questions 
asked as during sedation.  After  awakening, subjects will repeat the awake eyes open and eyes 
closed recordings (~10 minutes). The setup and awake recordings will take up to approximately 
2-[ADDRESS_689853] activity during sleep +/ - 10% can be 
used to predict consciousness during sedation and whether EEG characteristics are similar or not 
between sedation and sleep. Subjects will be reimbursed $50 for the nights recording.  
 
Sedation Protocol s: 
On a separate day to the baseline data ac quisition the subjects will be invited back for the first sedation 
experiment  (dexmedetomidine) . Subsequent sedation experiment s (for drugs in order),  will occur on 
separate days at least [ADDRESS_689854]  (only one study sedative will be a dministered on 
a given day) . Subjects will be reconsented on the day of sedation. If the patient is inappropriate for one 
sedative, due to a specific contraindication to that drug (and not the study in general) but are eligible for 
another drug, then they will progress through the order of sedatives (as above).  
 
Female patients will have a pregnancy test on the day of the sedation to confirm they are not pregnant.  
 
As in our previous protocol (IRB: Pearce (PI) 2008 -0018) at the beginning of this sessio n, participants will 
affirm that in the interval since their baseline visit, they have not acquired any of the cited exclusion 
criteria that would preclude participation. A review of these exclusion criteria will be completed by [CONTACT_531300]. A sta ndard pre -anesthetic assessment will be performed, including confirmation of 
NPO status, and documented using the standard Department of Anesthesiology pre -operative 
evaluation form. Participants will have the EEG cap placed and will be given a clear antac id (Bicitra), and 
a 20 -gauge intravenous catheter will be placed for drug delivery.  Supplemental oxygen will be provided 
at 2-10 L/minute via nasal cannula.  Many of the sedation drugs have been associated with nausea and 
vomiting, therefore each subject will be given Ondansetron (8 mg) intravenously as a nausea 
prophylactic during each procedure  as required . Ondansetron has limited side effects that are rarely 
reported but include headache and constipation.  The subject’s  EKG, non -invasive blood pressure, SaO2, 
exhaled CO2, and axillary skin temperature will be monitored continuously.  Before each experiment, 
the anesthesia machine and drug cart will undergo routine pre -anesthetic scrutiny, and the availability 
of resuscitation drugs and equipment will be c onfirmed and documented.  
 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page [ADDRESS_689855]. Level of consciousness will be assessed using the 5 -point OAA/S 
scale.  The level of 1 corresponds to “no eye opening or coherent response to verbal command or mild 
physical stimulus (mild shaking or prodding)”.  At this level of responsive ness, airway patency and 
ventilation are maintained in most, if not all, patients.  Patients will not be routinely intubated for this 
study.  
 
All anesthetic drugs t hat are being used in this study are FDA approved clinical anesthetics (propofol, 
dexmedetomidine and ketamine) in routine clinical use with a proven track record in clinical practice . 
They will be used in a manner analogous to clinical care with appropriate safety measures, dosing and 
treatments for side effects available. Contraindica tions to these drugs are rare but are a critical 
exclusion criteria. Anesthesia will be administered in a designated clinical anesthesia area in UWHC 
designed for this purpose : the lithotripsy suite  (C7/214)  in the Ambulatory Procedure Centre  (APC)  or 
the Motility room (C7/201) also in the APC . Both rooms are designated clinical anesthesia areas, with 
the same access to equipment/emergency care.  Drugs will be administered consistent with American 
Society of Anesthesiology and UW -Madison safety guidelines with full safety monitoring and access to 
clinical resuscitation equipment. Lactated Ringers or normal saline may also be administered anywhere 
from 25mL/hr to 1 000m L/hr at any point as needed. An anesthesiologist will be present th roughout the 
study procedures until the patient is awake.  In the APC, other faculty will be notified of the sedation in 
case of patient safety issues. If patient safety issues arise they will be managed in the standard clinical 
manner including an “Anesthesia stat” call if required. Recovery from anesthesia will occur in a 
designated clinical area for that purpose. All the sedative agents may provoke cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_531262], by [CONTACT_15374], in clinically approved 
environments. Full resuscitation equipment will be available throughout . 
 
In order to achieve more controlled transitions in drug concentrations, and therefore more stable 
levels of sedation when administering intravenous medications (dexmedetomidine, ketamine and 
propofol), the sedative infusion rate will be altered using information from Target Controlled 
Infusion (TCI) technology.  TCI is a mature technology that is used throughout the world10-15. It 
maintains stable plasma concentrations by [CONTACT_531301]. In addition to providing greater stability12,13, this method  minimizes the 
need for bolus administration11 and so reduces unwanted drug accumulation. We propose to use 
Rugloop  TCI software, which  is classified as “non -significant -risk”. It will be used only as an 
adjunct to clinical supervision of drug dosing by [CONTACT_101034]. TCI has been used in 
multiple volunteer a nd clinical studies safely10-15. Importantly, we will not deviate from 
approved FDA  total  drug doses.  TCI will enable the subject to stay in a stable sedative state 
allowing cognition to vary while drug concentrations are held constant. We will still be able to 
use all the prior data collected in the study by [CONTACT_531302].  
 
Dexmedetomidine : 
Dexmedetomidine is an ICU sedative noted for its safety and lack of idiosyncratic drug reactions. All 
adverse effects are dose -dependent and hence dexmedetomidine will be given thr ough slow 
intravenous infusion16. Dexmedetomidine is known for lack of respi[INVESTIGATOR_531263] . Close attention to these 
parameters will be mainta ined and treated as per standard anesthesiology measures as required. If 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page [ADDRESS_689856] been reported twice both 
with minimal effects  
 
Dexmedetomidine will be administered by [CONTACT_104482] (TCI) (following 15 minutes of acquisition of data in 
wakefulness as performed previously ). The infusion will be conducted consistent with FDA guidance/ 
approval of up to 1mcg/kg bolus followed by [CONTACT_531303] 0.2 -1.4 mcg /kg/hr  until the desired 
OAA/S level is achieved. Incremental  change s in infusion rate  will be allowed to  titrate to the subject’s 
cognitive and physiological state including, for example, slow ing bolus administration or b olusing in an 
incremental fashion . To aid in guiding these incremental changes, infusion rates will be adjusted 
using information from  the TCI model (Dyck model18) and clinical judgment. The TCI model 
will be asked to predict plasma concentrations of dexmedetomidine at 0.5 ng/ml inc rements 
allowing [ADDRESS_689857] throughout to ensure they are safe and the drugs are being administered at an 
appropriate rate as per clinical practice.  
 
Ketamine : 
Ketamine is an anesthetic noted for producing dreaming (disconnected consciou sness) that produces 
limited cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_531264]. Ketamine a lso preserves 
airway responses19. [CONTACT_155526] has visited Liege, Belgium to  witness their use of ketamine for fMRI and 
HD-EEG experiments. In volunteer studies, ketamine has been associated with nausea and vomiting and 
hence we will administer ondansetron 8mg intravenously at the end of the ketamine infusion.  
 
Ketamine  will be t itrated using  up to a 4.5mg/kg bolus over 10 minutes followed by 0.1 -0.5mg/min  
intravenous  infusion  with 5 minutes between increments and titrated to OAA/S level . This infusion rate 
may be slowed further or stopped for patient safety concerns. Infusion rates will be adjusted using 
information from t he TCI model (Domino model20) and clinical judgment. The TCI model will 
be asked to predict plasma concentrations of ketamine at 0.5mcg/ml increments allowing [ADDRESS_689858] safety. Short -lived emergence delirium (confusion on 
awakening) may occur on emergence from ketamine anesthesia and this will be managed through 
standard clinical practice including administration of midazolam (up to 4mg IV)  if required. However in 
most instances these epi[INVESTIGATOR_531265]. Allergic reactions to ketamine are extremely rare howe ver, as with all anesthesia care, full 
resuscitation equipment and supportive medications will be available.  
 
Propofol:  
Propofol is a standard anesthetic intravenous induction agent used for sedation for minor procedures in 
ambulatory settings due to its f avorable a nesthetic profile and wake -up. While it may be safely 
administered through bolus injections, we again will an infusion to provide a slow titration of sedation 
and reduce any safety concerns with the drug. Infusion rates will be adjusted using information 
from the TCI model (Ma rsh model21) and clinical judgment. The TCI model will be asked to 
predict plasma concentrations of propofol at 0.5mcg/ml in crements allowing 5 -minutes to 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page [ADDRESS_689859]. Subjects will be notified  that propofol can initially cause some pain on 
injection (through their IV line) and if this is not tolerable, the subject can withdraw from the study. 
Allergic reactions to propofol are rare. There have been concerns that food allergies may cross react 
with propofol b ut these have proven unfounded22. Nonetheless, while a reaction is considered unlikely, 
clinical grade resuscitation equipment will be available.  
 
Propofol  dosing  will be confined to FDA approved limits  with up to a  2.5mg/kg bolus over 1  to 3 minute  
followed by [CONTACT_60801] 50 -200mcg/kg/m in titrated to the desired OAA/S levels.  
 
Midazolam  
Midazolam is a sedative/anesthetic benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_531266] -critically ill patients. It is safe to administer through bolus injections or an 
infusion. We will administer midazolam in accordance with FDA guidance: initial boluses of up to 
0.35mg/kg followed by [CONTACT_531304] 0.1mg/kg/ h as a maintenance infusion. The side effects of 
midazolam are similar to propofol, though pain on injection are not noted. Allergic reactions are rare but 
standard clinical practice measures will be employed to ensure subject safety.  
 
In this session the subject will experience both HD-EEG and auditory stimuli (the Roving Oddball or LGD  
paradigm ) as described above during administration of each  sedative. The drugs will be titrated initially 
to an OAA/S Score of [ADDRESS_689860] drifts to sleep, they will lose feedback 
processing in the brain and this will lead to altered predictive coding.

4. Did you hear the tones /words ? Were you aware of your environment?  
5. Were you asleep or awake? (Visual Analogue Score 0 -6) 
 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page [ADDRESS_689862] whether they were conscious of their environment (conne cted 
consciousness), dreaming (disconnected consciousness), conscious but cannot remember details, 
unconscious (no report).  We will also ask whether they noticed time passing. We anticipate the 
questions will take 15s  and in the first [ADDRESS_689863] to return to OAA/S level  2/[ADDRESS_689864] these periods.  
 
The subjects will then be more deeply sedated to OAA/S [ADDRESS_689865] will be asked to squeeze the observer’s hand and open their eyes and then 
asked to squeeze again if they have pain  mimicking our recent isolated forearm technique study 
demonstrating that 4.6% of subject become wakeful after intubation under general anesthesia . If they 
become awake enough to answer the questions above, these will be repeated. A maximum of 20 stimuli 
will be administered over 20 minutes (one per minute). The drugs will then be stopped and the EEG 
continued until the subject is OAA/S  5. At that point we will conduct the Confusion Assessment Method 
(CAM) to assess for delirium on awakening and monitor the patient until there is absence of delirium on 
the CAM test.  We estimate the whole study duration will be five hours , four of which will  be sedation . 
 
Participants will be observed in the clinical environment until they are judged by [CONTACT_531305] (CRU ) to complete the  recovery process . We 
anticipate th e full recovery from the sedatives to take at least two hours. Orders for post -sedation care 
in the C RU will follow standard post -sedation hospi[INVESTIGATOR_531267].  UWHC 
clinical criteria for ‘street readiness ’ will be used to determine suitability for discharge after a procedure 
performed under sedation. Participants will be discharged by [CONTACT_531306] C RU nurse according to pre -determined criteria. Participants w ill be given a copy of 
instructions and contact [CONTACT_531307][INVESTIGATOR_307], and 
they will be mandated to be accompanied home by a companion.  Patients will be instructed not to 
drive or operate machinery, a nd not to consume other drugs with central nervous system activity within 
[ADDRESS_689866] incidents  (e.g. nausea, headache, mood disturbance). This information will be 
documented on a post -procedure adverse event form.   
 
If patients have been enrolled in the study previously and re -present for another sedati on epi[INVESTIGATOR_531268] -screening but will have a new consent completed with their prior ID – X, where X is a 
number that  refers to the number of their sedation visits. E.g. if this is the second visit study ID -2. 
 
Sedation Appointment Follow -Up 
Participants will be called by [CONTACT_531308]. During this phone 
call, the participant will be asked about their recovery from sedation and any adverse events will be 
recorded. During this phone call, the partic ipant will also be asked if they can write a summary of what 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page [ADDRESS_689867] within their participant folder.  
  
7.1. Data to be recorded  
Demographics  (age, sex, right handed or left handed, ASA grade, level of anxiety prior to commencing 
drug (on visual analogue scale) , physiological variables, blood samples for intravenous sed atives  plasma 
concentration  (ketamine, propofol , midazolam  and dexmedetomidine) , Intra -procedural data 
(responsiveness to questions during sedative procedures,  responses to predictive coding tasks , OAA/S 
status, etc .) Roving Oddball  or LGD  paradigm details and EEG data will be collected from each subject , 
recorded in the CRF (see appendix 1),  and stored in an anonymized fashion on secure servers.  
 
7.2. Blood sample collection  
Patients sedated with ketamine, propofol , midazolam  and dexmedetomidine will have two intravenous 
lines placed for administration of sedatives and rescue medications/blood draws respectively. All of the 
lines will be placed in preparation on the day of the sedative procedu re.  
 
Blood samples  for plasma drug levels  will be drawn a drug induced OAA/S 2 -3 and OAA/S 1 levels are 
reached. Two 5ml blood samples will be drawn for consistency.   Each blood sample will be a 5  mL 
sample from the intravenous line indicated for blood sa mpling in EDTA tubes. The total amount of blood 
drawn for this stud y will be approximatel y 80 mL (2* 2*5 mL samples for each sedative drug x 4 sedative 
drugs). The samples will be stored on ice until processed in [CONTACT_531331]’s Lab. Samples will be spun 
down to plasma and alliquotted into separate vials labeled with coded subject data and frozen at -80° F 
until analysis. Further analyses may require processing of de-identified and anonymized  data in other 
laboratories but patient confidentiality will be maintained.  
 
7.3. Data entry  
Data collected for this study will be recorded on  electronic  Case Report Forms (CRFs)  (see appendix 1) 
and stored on secure servers in the Department of Anesthesology . Adverse events will also be recorded 
in OnCore to facilitate the D MC. 
 
Clinical Trials Management Software:  
Online Collaborative Research Environmen t-Clinical Research Management (OnCore) will serve as the 
Clinical Trial Management System for this study.  ICTR OnCore is supported by [CONTACT_531309] (SMPH -IT) staff and managed by [CONTACT_531310] R esearch Infrastructure System (CRIS).  
 
OnCore is a sophisticated, web -based data management system that: a) ensures secure, easy data entry 
at multiple sites; b) integrates multiple data sources; c) provides controlled, secure access to sensitive 
data usi ng role -based access control; d) provides workflow automation; and e) allows export and 
reporting of data for Data and Safety Monitoring Boards and biostatisticians. This software provides 
protocol management functions (e.g. subject scheduling; screening, data organization), maintains 
updated forms, addresses budget development, billing, and fiscal management, generates summary 
reports, and provides essential links with other research administration and electronic medical records 
systems. ICTR OnCore eases the burden of the individual researcher and unifies protocol management 
within research programs and across research sites, enhancing protocol integrity and regulatory 
compliance efforts.  
 
7.4. Subject withdrawals  
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page 29 of 52 Subjects that do not meet the EEG signaling criteria (due to craniofacial muscle artifact) will be 
withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_531311]. Their consent and data collected 
up to this point will be maintained as part of the study records. Additionally, s ubjects will be withdrawn 
if safety concerns arise (see adverse events below).  
 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study prior to any sedative procedures, they will not count towards 
the enrollment total of [ADDRESS_689868] one of the sedative procedures has been completed, they 
will remain part of the study total enrollment numbers.  
 
7.5. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_531269] (such as cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_531270] ) the study drug will be stopped immediately . If 
any degree of ventilatory insufficiency is detected, the anesthesiologist in attendance will adjust the 
position of the airway and assist ventilation with bag, mask and supplemental oxygen as necessary.  
 
Pulmonary aspi[INVESTIGATOR_152211]:  Participants who have received an oral clear antacid after an 
8-hour fast are at very low risk for pulmonary aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  Participants will be closely monitored for signs 
of nausea and vomiting, and the experiment  will be terminated in the event of emesis . 
 
In the event of an allergic reaction, the study drug will be stopped immediately. The subjects will be 
given chlorpheniramine 10mg, hydrocortisone 100mg and will be reviewed for necessary anaphylaxis 
protocols. Allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to anesthetic drugs are extremely rare.  
 
If heart rate falls below 40bpm or mean arterial blood pressure falls <55  mmHg  or >133 mmHg , the 
experiment will be stopped and the patient will be treated until stable.  
 
Sedation will be limited to a 4 hour maximum duration, once 4 hours has elapsed the sedation will be 
stopped and the patient will be woken up.  
 
The study will be stopped as ad vised by [CONTACT_531312] . 
Seizures and intubations will be notified to the ICTR DMC within 7 days of the event. The DMC will be 
informed of study progress on a monthly basis and any serious adverse events includi ng drug reactions 
will be reported to the DMC within 24 hours of occurrence . 
 
8. Data analysis and statistical considerations  
 
8.1. Sample size determination  
 
Spontaneous EEG: Our primary outcome is difference in delta power (also known as slow wave activity) 
over posterior cortex between consciousness and unconsciousness during sedation. Our preliminary 
data suggest that a mean difference in 12 dB with a standar d deviation of 12 dB requires 16  subjects per  
group. An additional 4  subjects per group are recruited may be to difficult to wake patients and get 
descriptions of the subjects conscious experience through questioning hence approval is sought for the 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page 30 of 52 enrollment of 20 participants per drug in the present proposal. In total 80 subjects will be recruited.   
Secondary endpoints: All secondary endpoints are considered exploratory:  
1. The incidence of disconnected conscious expe rience (dreaming) versus connected conscious 
experience (awareness of the external world) during sedation.  
2. The ability to percieve visual illusions (defined as time to perceive the illusion and percentage 
accuracy of perceiving the illusion) or match audit ory and visual cues (defined as the time to match 
the cues and percentage accuracy of matching the cues).  
3. Differences in auditory and visual evoked responses under sedation compared to wakefulness and 
other conscious states.  
 
Exploratory endpoints:  
1. Difference in HD -EEG responses assessed by [CONTACT_531313]. Phase locking factor is calculated by [CONTACT_531314]. PLF is 
quantified on a scale of [ADDRESS_689869] 
consciousness under sedation (confirmed by r eport of participant) with lack of report 
(unconsciousness).  The percent difference in duration of Phase Locking Factor (PLF) following 
auditory  stimuli  in the consciousness state (PLFc) of anesthesia compared to the unconsciousness 
state (PLFu) of anesthe sia (100*[PLFu -PLFc]/PLFc).  Duration of PLF from the conscious and 
unconscious states will be a single value which has been averaged over all measurements from all 
channels across the scalp.  The primary hypothesis is that at least one of the drugs will s how a 
significant difference in percent difference in duration of PLF between the two consciousness states.  
 
2. Drug effect on percent difference in duration of PLF between the two consciousness states.  
3. The effect of consciousness during sedation vs. unconsciousness during sedation on PLF following 
auditory stimulation.  
4. Differences in connectivity between conscious states.  
  
8.[ADDRESS_689870] 8 0% power at an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_689871] a null hypothesis of 0 dB difference. These 
estimates are made based on pre -acquired data comparing consciousness in ketamine sedation with 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page 31 of 52 deep anesthesia  (propofol). We anticipate that in 25% of subjects it may be to difficult to wake patients 
and get descriptions of the subjects conscious experience through questioning hence approval is sought 
for the enrollment of [ADDRESS_689872] 86% power to show a 20%  difference in the Phase Locking Factor  using a single sample t -test 
against a null hypothesis of 0% difference. These estimates are made based on pre -acquired data 
comparing consciousness in wakefulness with deep anesthesia (propofol).  
Sedation will be recorded as the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scal e. Standard 
clinical monitoring of physiological variables (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], and oxygen saturation) will be recorded. The imaging and EEG endpoints will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_531315] S tatistical Parametric Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_531271]. Following FIR filtering we will 
calculate the  spontaneous delta power at CPz (as well as in the precuneus in source space) as  well as  PLF 
per channel as calculated previously23 and then average all channels across the scalp to get a single 
value per subject. The difference in delta power (primary endpoint) and the percent diffe rence in 
duration of PLF following the audit ory stimuli  between consciousness and unconsciousness will be 
compared against a null hypothesis of 0dB or 0% difference respectively with single sample t -tests for 
each drug individually with an alpha level of 0.0125.  An exploratory  analysis will look for a drug effect in 
the percent difference in duration of PLF , or other evoked response changes,  between the two 
consciousness states with a repeated measures ANOVA with drug as a fixed effect and subje ct as a 
random effect.  If we  report  this analysis we will explicitly state that the subjects were not randomized 
to each sedative. Other exploratory analysis will look at possible differences in percent difference in 
duration of PLF following audi tory stimulation.  This will be analyzed in the same methods as the primary 
endpoint. Secondary and exploratory analyzes will be conducted at a significance level of 0.05.  We 
acknowledge that we are likely under powered to detect statistically significant differences in our 
secondary analy ses however the results can be foundation blocks for further studies on the differences 
between consciousness and unconsciousness states of anesthesia.  Underpowered exploratory analy ses 
may not be completed  if the analysis would not yield meaningful results  for future studies . 
 
 
5. Risks and benefits of trial participation  
Overall, risks in this study should be infrequent. Specific risks for individual study procedures are 
detailed below.  
 
None of the procedures included in this study are consider ed to be therapeutic or diagnostic, as detailed 
for each specific procedure. Each of the procedures has minimal risks associated with them, and have 
been employed successfully, without incident, by [CONTACT_531316] 10 years in sleep 
[Protoco ls H-2001 -456, H -2002 -414, H -2003 -238, H -2004 -0023, H -2004 -444, H -2007 -0150]. Furthermore 
we have specifically applied HD-EEG safely during anesthesia (IRB: Pearce (PI) 2008 -0018) and seek to 
extend these findings here.

obstruction  if given too rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. Propofol may also cause hypotension, hypertension, apnea, oxygen 
desaturation, arrhythmia, stinging  at injection site, rash and pruritus. Allergy to prop ofol has been 
reported  but is rare . 
 
Ketamine  
Short -lived emergence delirium (confusion on awakening) may occur on emergence from ketamine 
anesthesia and this will be managed through standard clinical practice including administration of 
midazolam (up to 4mg IV) if required . Other common side effects may include hypotension, bradycardia, 
arrhythmia, apnea, laryngospasms, diplopia, nystagmus, increased intraocular pressure, and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
 
Dexmedetomidine  
Dexmedetomidine is known for lack of respi[INVESTIGATOR_531272] , dry mouth  and hypotension. Close attention to these parameters will be 
maintained and treated as per standard anesthesiology measures as required. If interventions are 
required, dexmedetomidine infusion will be stopped.   
 
Midazolam  
Midazolam may cause cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_531273].  Other common side effects include hiccoughs, headache, nausea, 
vomiting, coughing and drowsiness.

UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page 33 of 52 EEG:  
Electroencephalography is a technique commonly used to non -invasively measure electric brain activity 
both in research and in clinic . There i s no risk from EEG recording.  However, individuals with very 
sensitive skin may experience, on rare occasion, a slight irritation at the site of sensor application due to 
the use of mildly conductive saline gel and site preparation for EEG recording.  Con tinuous EEG 
monitoring during audit ory stimulation  represents an additional safety factor allowing the early 
detection of any sign of EEG abnormality.  The hd-EEG recording device will be screened for current leak 
before use in the operating room.  
 
Intravenous Catheters:   
Intravenous catheters will be placed by [CONTACT_531317].  Nevertheless there may be some discomfort to participants upon insertion, and 
there may be a slight risk of bru ising, and inflammation after removal.  In normal subjects subcutaneous 
infiltration and induration are very rare complications, and are easily managed with warm packs and 
oral analgesics.  
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] / loss of patent airway:  
Because the anest hetics will be administered incrementally under close observation, we expect that if 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_531275].  In general, a reposition of the 
airway (i.e., jaw thrust) and assisted ventilation with bag and ma sk will be sufficient to return the 
participant to full ventilatory control within several minutes.  If greater assistance is required, a standard 
oral, nasal and laryngeal mask airways will be immediately available. Caregivers are skilled in their use.  
Full resuscitation equipment will also be available if required.  
 
Pulmonary aspi[INVESTIGATOR_152211] :  
Participants who have received an oral clear antacid after an [ADDRESS_689874] are at very low risk for 
pulmonary aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  Participants will be close ly monitored for signs of nausea and vomiting, and the 
experiment will be terminated in the event of emesis.  Participants will be sedated in the operating 
room on tables allowing positions that reduce the risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_531276], and a fully opera tional 
suction apparatus will be available at all times.  During recovery, participants will be closely observed for 
signs of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and instructed in the steps to take if signs of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_531277].  
 
Cardiovascular Effects:  
All the se dative drugs can provoke cardiovascular changes including hypotension and hypertension, 
bradycardia and tachycardia and arrhythmias. These may be most pronounced for dexmedetomidine. If 
these arise they will be treated in line with standard clinical care i ncluding administration of medications 
and fluids as clinically appropriate.  
 
Prolonged sedation:  
It is anticipated that most, if not all, participants wi ll have fully recovered within [ADDRESS_689875] instructions after proce dural sedation.  
 
Drug allergy and other side effects:   
Allergies to  ondansetron,  propofol, ketamine,  midazolam  and dexmedetomidine  administration are 
extremely rare. Patients with known allergy will be excluded.  While a number of side effects have been 
report with acute and chronic use, they are very uncommon.  Common or serious risks include residual 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page 34 of 52 'hangover' after administration of midazolam, such as sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and impaired psychomotor and 
cognitive functions that may persist into the next day, and may impair the ability of users to drive safely.   
 
Risks associated with loss of confidentiality  
There is a risk that information recorded about subjects  will be shared with people who would not 
normally have access to this information.  
 
Unknown risks  
This study  may involve risks to the subject which are currently unforeseeable . We will inform subjects as 
soon as possible if we discover any  information that may affect the subject 's health, welfare, or decision 
to be in this study . 
 
b. Mitigation of potential risks 
An anesthesiologist will ensure that subjects fit the inclusion criteria for the study and should not be 
excluded for safety reasons. The  Anesthesiologist  will be present throughout the study to ensure safety 
at clinical standards. If it is judged the patient is at risk from continuation of the study, the study will be 
stopped. Patients who are at risk from seizure induction will be excluded.  
 
 
Mitigation o f risks associated with EEG:  There are no known risks from EEG.  
 
Mitigation of risks associated with Sedation:  The Anesthesiologist will be present throughout the study 
to ensure safety at clinical standards  including administration of required medication s and fluids to 
maintain subject safety . Clinical grade  anesthesia and resuscitation equipment will be available 
throughout the study.  Subjects will be instructed not to drive or operate heavy machinery and must be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_531318] a ride from another service. The study 
coordinator will verbally confirm this with the subject. The study coordinator  will also instruct the 
subject to be accompanied overnight and verbally confirm this will happen with the subject.  
 
Mitigation of risks associated with Blood Draws: Staff obtaining blood samples will have the necessary 
training and draw samples from exist ing venous catheters.  
 
 
 
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page [ADDRESS_689876] benefit will accrue to participants. We anticipate that s ociety may benefit from the possible 
development of a new diagnostic technique (i.e., a monitor of sedation and anesthesia), and because 
information may be obtained regarding the mechanisms of conscious experience  that has important 
ramifications for detecting/preventing consciousness during anesthesia and sedation and in neurological 
conditions such as unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and coma . Furthermore in our recent 
ConsCIOUS study , 4% of patients during routine general anesthesia were aware of intubation  
(connected consciousness) . Half of these, 2% of all people were in pain. This is a good example of why it 
is important for us to understand the mechanisms and markers for conscious experience that is related 
to the external world (connected consciousness). In order to identify the markers and mechanisms of 
connected consciousness, it is important to perform “within state” experiments such as probing 
conscious experience during sedati on, as we plan here. If we are able to identify a marker of sensory 
disconnection or unconsciousness in these studies this will have great potential importance for the 
clinical care of patients under anesthesia and sedation. These potential benefits go bey ond 
anesthesiology and may inform diverse fields from the disorders of consciousness (such as coma or 
delirium) to sleep.  Finally once we identify a potential marker, studies can be undertaken to understand 
the mechanisms of sensory connectedness under ane sthesia/sedation followed by [CONTACT_531319]/sedation through targeting these mechanisms.  It is also 
important to separate connected consciousness (experience of external world) from disconnected 
consciousness (dre ams). If an anesthesia monitor could detect disconnected consciousness  (e.g. 
dreaming as occurs in 10 -30% of people during emergence from anesthesia)  then this might imply to the 
care provider that they should deepen the anesthetic but this would not be ne cessary as the patient is 
unaware of the surgery. Hence a marker of sensory disconnection/connectedness (to provide an index 
of likelihood of awareness of surgery) will provide  important information to guide the clinical care of 
patients undergoing anesthe sia and sedation. Overall our work aims to identify markers of conscious 
experience under anesthesia, whether it is connected or disconnected, and use these markers to define 
clinical monitoring devices and novel pharmacological strategies to reduce patien t experience of surgery 
under anesthesia.  
 
 
6. Adverse events  and unanticipated problems  
 
a. Adverse event definitions  
 
Adverse event (AE)  
An adverse event is defined as a ny untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject 
including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the subject's participation 
in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject's participation in the research.  Patients 
will be phoned 24 hours after discharge to confirm a lack of adverse events.

entered into OnCore for review by [CONTACT_1363].  
 
f. Other reportable events  
Reporting timeframes begin when the site learns of the occurrence of the event.  
 
Event  Definition  Reporting  
Breach of 
confidentiality  The exposure of any study information or 
communications directly related to a study 
subject to anyone not named as stud y staff or the 
release of a study subject’s identifiable 
information to study staff who were not specified 
to receive such information in the protocol or IRB 
application.  Treat as major deviation  
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page [ADDRESS_689877] of the study. Deviations may result from 
the action of the participant, investigator, or 
staff.  See below  
Major 
deviations  Deviations are considered major when the 
unapproved chang e(s) in previously approved 
research activities, implemented without IRB 
approval, may potentially adversely affect 
subjects’ rights, safety, welfare, or willingness to 
continue participation, or affect the scientific 
design of the study and/or the integri ty of the 
resultant data.  Treat as an Unanticipated 
Problem  
Minor 
deviations  Deviations are considered minor when the 
unapproved change(s) in previously approved 
research activities, implemented without IRB 
approval, do not adversely affect subjects or the 
integrity of the study data . Sites are to report cumulative 
events to AE Coordinator at 
time of continuing review.  
Protocol 
violation  An incident involving an intentional deviation 
from the IRB -approved protocol that was not 
implemented i n response to an emergency 
situation and that may impact a subject’s rights, 
safety, and/or welfare, makes a substantial 
alteration to risks to subjects, or affects the 
scientific design of the study and/or the integrity 
of the resultant data. Violations m ay also be 
repeated deviations (major or minor) of the same 
nature. Violations can represent serious or 
continuing non -compliance with the federal 
regulations and guidelines for ethical conduct of 
human subject research.  Treat as an Unanticipated 
Problem  
Protocol 
Exceptions  A protocol exception is an IRB -approved 
deviation for a single subject or a small group of 
subjects, but is not a permanent revision to the 
research protocol . Protocol exceptions must be 
approved by [CONTACT_531320].  
 
g. Reporting by [CONTACT_531321] s tudy site will follow their local IRBs guidance for reporting all events to the local IRB.  
 
 
7. Data Safety Monitoring  
 
We plan to utilize the UW I nstitute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR)  Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) to oversee the study. T he UW ICTR DMC is comprised of experienced members (core 
plus ad hoc) with expertise required to oversee this study. The DMC members will review protocol -
specific reports created by [CONTACT_531322]| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page [ADDRESS_689878] of this study, the ICTR DMC will meet biannually . Additional 
meetings may be scheduled as determined by [CONTACT_262635].   
 
 
8. Medical Monitor  
The Medical Monitor may perform oversight functions (e.g., observe recruitment, enrollment 
procedures, and the consent process for indi viduals, groups or units; oversee study interventions and 
interactions; review monitoring plans and reports; and oversee data matching, data collection, and 
analysis) and report their observations and findings to the sponsor or a designated official.  
 
The Medical Monitor may discuss the research protocol with the investigators, interview human 
subjects, and consult with others outside of the study about the research. The Medical Monitor shall 
have authority to stop a research protocol in progress, remove in dividual human subjects from a 
research protocol, and take whatever steps are necessary to protect the safety and well -being of human 
subjects. Medical Monitor shall have the responsibility to promptly report their observations and 
findings to the sponsor or other designated official.  
 
Each participating site’s local IRB must approve a written summary of the Monitors’ duties, authorities, 
and responsibilities.  
 
The Medical Monitor shall have expertise consonant with the nature of risk(s) identified within the 
research protocol, and shall be independent of the team conducting the research involving human 
subjects.  
 
The Medical Monitor is required to review reports of serious adverse events (SAEs) and unanticipated 
problems (UPs) and provide an independent ev aluation and an unbiased, written report of each event. 
At a minimum, the Medical Monitor shall comment on the outcomes of the event or problem, and in the 
case of an SAE comment on the relationship to participation in the study. The Medical Monitor shall also 
indicate whether he or she concurs with the details of the report provided by [CONTACT_6962]. The 
Medical Monitor’s evaluation of these events will be provided to each participating site’s local IRB.  
 
If requested, the Medical Monitor shall hav e access to de -identified source documents.  
 
The Medical Monitor for this trial is [CONTACT_531332].  
 
 
9. Administrative requirements  
 
a. Good clinical practice  
UnConsCIOUS Study| Protocol  (version date : 1/11/2023 ) page [ADDRESS_689879]. Study data will be ent ered 
into an electronic case report form (eCRF) by [CONTACT_8786] .  
 
c. Ethical consideration  
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The IRB will review all appropriate study documentation in order to safeguard the rights, safety and 
well-being of the subjects . The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB approval has been 
obtained. The protocol, informed consent form, written informatio n given to the patients, safety 
updates, annual progress report s and any revisions to these documents will be  provided to the IRB  by 
[CONTACT_093].  
 
d. Patient confidentiality  
All subjects will be assigned a study -specific ID number. We will maintain a master list linking each 
subject’s medical record number (MRN) with a study -specific ID number. This list will be maintained in a 
location separate from any study data. Only site staff listed on the IRB applic ation shall have access to 
the list.  
 
 
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements 
of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Those regulations require a

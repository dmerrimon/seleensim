STUDY SYNOPSIS
Protocol number:  SPD489-348 Drug: Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate
Title of the study:  A Phase 3, Open-label, Multicenter, 12-Month Safety and Tolerability Study of SPD489 in 
Preschool Children Aged 4-5 Years Diagnosed with Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
Number of subjects:
Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled into this study. Subjects will enroll into this study from antecedent 
study, SPD489-211 or SPD489-347. If a decision is made to enroll subjects directly, the study procedures and 
definition of baseline for directly enrolled subjects will be described in the amended protocol.
The sample size was established to provide long-term safety data in this population.
Investigator(s):   Multicenter
Site(s) and Region(s): 
Approximately 20 sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US)
Study period (planned):2014-2021Clinical phase: 3
Objectives:
Primary:  To evaluate the long-term safety of SPD489 administered as a daily morning dose (5, 10, 15, 20, and 
30mg/day) in preschool children (4-5 years of a ge inclusive) diagnosed with Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity 
Disorder (ADHD).
The evaluation of safety and tolerability will be based on the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), specific evaluation of blood pressure, pulse, we ight, height, clinical laboratory evaluations,
electrocardiogram (ECG) results, and sleep assessments.
Secondary: 
1. To describe the long-term efficacy of SPD489 using the clinician administered Attention-
deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV Preschool Version (ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version).
2. To describe the long-term efficacy of SPD489 using global clinical measures of improvement, as measured 
by [CONTACT_98948] – Global Improvement (CGI-I).
Rationale:The purpose of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety of SPD489 in preschool children who are diagnosed 
with ADHD. Based on IMS Health data and discussion at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pediatric 
Advisory Committee in September 2012, it has been noted that there is off-label use of SPD489 in children 
under 5 years old (4%, or approximately 100 000 patients betw een February 2007 and March 2012).  The lack 
of controlled data regarding the safety and efficacy of SPD489 in the preschool ADHD population, along with 
the prevalence of off-label prescribing of SPD489 supports the need for SPD489 studies in the preschool ADHD 
population.  Importantly, it is not known if the therapeutic effects of stimulant medications in school age children with ADHD can be extrapolated to preschool children with ADHD.  There are some indications that the effect size may be reduced (Greenhill 2006).  There may also be differences in the safety and pharmacokinetic 
profiles (Wigal 2007; Wigal 2006).
Generating long-term safety data in this population will provide important information on the use of  SPD489 in 
the preschool ADHD population.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1139602], dose, and mode of administration:
The sponsor will provide SPD489 as 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30mg strength capsules.
All subjects will be instructed to take 1 capsule daily throughout the study at approximately 7:00AM (+/-2 
hours). SPD489 will be administered one of the following ways: 
•swallow SPD489 capsules whole, or
•open capsules, empty and mix the entire contents either with yogurt, water, or orange juice.
The contents should be mixed until completely dispersed. The subject must ingest the entire amount of the 
mixture immediately within [ADDRESS_1139603] should not take anything less than one capsule per day and a 
single capsule can not be split. The empty gelatinous capsule should be discarded. 
Methodology:
This study is a Phase 3 long- term, open -label, safety and tolerability study in preschool children (4-5 years of 
age inclusive at the time of entry into antecedent study or at the time of enrollment if directly enrolled) with 
Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
The study will enroll two types of subjects; Subjects “A” and Subjects “B”. The “A” Subjects will have 2 
periods: (1) Dose Maintenance and (2) Safety Follow-up. The “B” Subjects will have 4 periods: (1) Screening 
and Washout; (2) Dose-optimization; (3) Dose Maintenance; and (4) Safety Follow-up.
The duration of the evaluation phase for “A” Subjects (Dose Maintenance) and “B” Subjects (Dose-optimization 
and Maintenance) will be 52 weeks. 
SPD489 will be provided in 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30mg capsules.Visit 0 procedures for “A” Subjects will be performed at the final dose maintenance visit of the antecedent 
study. 
Subjects will be required to visit the site up to 20 times over a 57-week p eriod, depending on their assignment.
“A” Subjects may visit the site up to 13 times while “B” Subjects may visit the site up to [ADDRESS_1139604] 2014

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate caps ules (SPD489, previously referred to as NRP104) were 
developed for the once- daily treatment of ADHD.
SPD489 capsules contain 5, 10, 15, 20, or 30mg of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, a new 
chemical entity designed for once-daily oral administration.  Lisdexamfetamine itself is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug.  After ingestion it is converted to l-lysine (a naturally 
occurring essential amino acid) and dextroamphetamine ( d-amphetamine, responsible for 
pharmacological activity) primarily in the blood.
Amphetamine is a chiral compound that exists as 2 stereoisomers: dextro (d)- and levo (l)-
amphetamine. Lisdexamfetamine is the l-lysine conjugate of the dextro stereoisomer.  After oral administration, lisdexamfetamine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_822067] l-lysine (a naturally occurring amino acid) and d-amphetamine, which is responsible for the drug’s pharmacological activity.
Lisdexamfetamine is classified as a psychomotor stimulant.  Amphetamine appears to exert its pharmacological effects in the CNS by [CONTACT_822080]. Amphetamine increases synaptic levels of dopamine (DA), norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) through multiple mechanisms ( Hardman et al. 2001). It promotes the release 
of DA, NE, and 5-HT into the extraneuronal space, and also inhibits the reuptake of DA and NE into the pre-synaptic nerve terminal resulting in prolonged residency of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. In addition to producing a CNS response, amphetamine treatment is also associated with cardiovascular effects such as an increase in SBP and DBP, and pulse. Amphetamine may also suppress the appetite.
In addition to the approved indication of ADHD, other indications have been explored.Additional information can be found in the current IB for SPD489.
1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options 
Attention-deficit/hy peractivity disorder is a heterogeneous neurobehavioral disorder 
characterised by a pattern of developmentally inappropriate inattentiveness, impulsivity, and 
hyperactivity resulting in clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.  Although ADHD was originally thought to be a disorder primarily affecting elementary school age children; it has become clear that ADHD may persist across a 
lifetime, and that ADHD symptoms may manifest several years prior to entry into elementary school.  
Shire CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1139616] scientifically rigorous ADHD studies in this population.  It would be beneficial to provide additional evidence-based support for ADHD treatment decisions in the preschool population.  
Estimates of the prevalence of ADHD in the preschool population vary depending on the 
referral source and the method used to diagnose ADHD; however it appears that approximately 4-5% of preschool children are considered to have ADHD.  Using the PAPA, an assessment validated for use in the preschool population, the prevalence of ADHD in a sample of 1 073 children aged 2-5 years was reported to be 3.9-5.1% ( Egger et al. 2006a ; 
Egger 2004; Greenhill 2008 ).  In 2007, the National Survey of Children’s Health obtained 
information from parents of 73,123 children aged 4-17 years ( MMWR 2010).  Parents 
reported a current diagnosis of ADHD in 5.5% of 4- 10 year olds ( MMWR 2010 ).  Prevalence 
in males aged 4-11 is roughly 3 times greater than in females ( Szatmari 1989 ).
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is characterized by [CONTACT_822081], hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are “maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental 
level” (DSM-IV).   Preschool children, ages  3-5 years, often exhibit symptoms of 
hyperactivity and impulsivity, so it may be challenging to delineate what is “inconsistent with developmental level” for this population ( Smith 2007) .  Nevertheless, it is possible to 
diagnose ADHD in the preschool population in a reliable fashion ( Egger et al. 2006a ;Egger et 
al. 2006b; McGoey et al. 2007) .
The presence of ADHD symptoms that are frequent, severe, and developmentally inappropriate, can be used to define ADHD in this population ( Connor 2002 ;Smith 2007 ).  In 
addition, impairment in [ADDRESS_1139617] been validated for this population and include age-appropriate questions and prompts ( Egger et al. 2006a; McGoey  et al. 2007).  
It is appropriate to consider whether an ADHD diagnosis in a preschool child will endure or resolve as the child matures.  ADHD has been described in terms of a developmental 
trajectory that can be modified by [CONTACT_822082] (Sonuga-Barke and 
Halperin 2010; Sonuga-Barke et al. 2005) .  Potential risk factors such as severity of ADHD 
symptoms, the presence of oppositional defiant symptoms, and neuropsychological 
impairment may affect the course of ADHD (Sonuga-Barke and Halperin 2010).  Although 
some children may not retain the ADHD diagnosis as they grow older, for many children the diagnosis endures beyond their preschool years (Lahey et al. 2004; Tandon et al. 2011).  In a 
sample of 96 children aged 4-6 years with ADHD, 79% of the children continued to have an ADHD diagnosis 3 years later as compared to 3% of the non-ADHD control children ( Lahey
et al. 2004).  This finding was replicated in a sample of [ADDRESS_1139618] 2014
Protocol SPD489-348 Version 1.0, FINAL Page 28 of 87
ADHD who were followed for 2 years ( Tandon et al. 2011).  These results suggest that when 
an ADHD diagnosis is first made in a preschool child, it is likely to be stable over time. 
The constellation of impairments associated with an ADHD diagnosis in preschool children 
suggests a characteristic profile similar to that for individuals diagnosed after the preschool period.  Preschool children with ADHD demonstrate impairments in social functioning and pre-academic skills ( Dupaul et al. 2001 ;Ghuman et al. 2008).  They are also more likely to be 
aggressive towards others and to sustain an injury ( Greenhill et al. 2008; Rappley et al. 1999 ;
Connor et al. 2003) .  In a longitudinal study which followed children from ages 4-21 years, 
the attention span at age 4 years predicted math and reading skills at age 21 years and 
completion of college at age 25 years ( McClel land et al. 2013) .
Currently, the lack of a robust body of evidence derived from controlled clinical studies in preschool children makes it difficult to create reliable treatment recommendations. The AAP ADHD Clinical Practice guideline suggests that preschool children with ADHD initiate 
treatment with behavioral therapy prior to using pharmacotherapy (Subcommittee on ADHD 
2011); however the PATS results indicates that (13%) preschool children have a satisfactory 
response to behavioral therapy ( Greenhill et al. 2006) .If the preschool child with ADHD 
does not respond to behavioral therapy, the guideline then suggests the use of 
methylphenidate. Of note, methylphenidate does not have an indication for a population less 
than 6 years old ( Subcommittee on ADHD 2011). Immediate-release Adderall 
(dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate) and dextroamphetamine are approved for children with ADHD as young as [ADDRESS_1139619] Background and Clinical Information

1.2.1 Preclinical Information
Lisdexamfetamine is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug. After ingestion, it is converted in 
the blood to d-amphetamine (responsible for phar macological activity) and l-lysine (a 
naturally occurring essential amino acid). A comprehensive set of studies has been conducted to evaluate the pharmacological and toxicological properties associated with the parent compound lisdexamfetamine.  The safety profiles associated with d-amphetamine and l-lysine 
are well established.
All safety and toxicology studies, except the single dose acute toxicity study in rats, were 
conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice.Complete preclinical information is presented in the current SPD489 IB.

0 ∞ and C max
generally behaved in a linear, dose-proportional manner. The weight-normalized d-amphetamine AUC
0 ∞ is similar for children and adults, with t max and t ½consistent across age 
groups.
In the ADHD Clinical Development Program, the efficacy of SPD489 for the treatment of
ADHD has been demonstrated for children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD. Substantial evidence of efficacy was provided in well-controlled studies, where SPD489 was shown to be 
effective compared to placebo. SPD489 was associated with a statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvement in ADHD symptoms, functional outcomes, and health-related quality of life compared to placebo, in studies that used a variety of study designs, a variety of validated assessments, and a variety of raters.
The well-characterized SPD489 safety profile was consistent with that of other stimulants 
used in the treatment of ADHD. When the safety results from the [ADDRESS_1139622] frequently reported AEs were those typi[INVESTIGATOR_822068] (including decreased appetite, insomnia, headache, dry mouth, irritability, upper abdominal pain, and weight decrease), or potentially attributable to intercurrent illnesses (e.g., upper 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1139623] infection and nasopharyngitis). These TEAEs were generally non-serious and 
were considered by [CONTACT_822083].
Stimulant medications like SPD489 cause a modest increase in average blood pressure (about
2-4 mmHg) and average pulse (about 3-6 bpm). Individuals may have larger increases.

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE
2.1 Rationale for the Study
Based on IMS Health data and discussion at the FDA Pediatric Advisory Committee in 
September 2012, it has been noted that there is off-label use of SPD489 in children under 5 
years old (4%, or approximately 100 000 patients between February 2007 and March 2012).  
The lack of controlled data regarding the safety and efficacy of SPD489 in the preschool ADHD population, along with the pr evalence of off-label prescribing of SPD489 supports the 
need for SPD489 studies in the preschool ADHD population.  Importantly, it is not known if the therapeutic effects of stimulant medications in school age children with ADHD can be 
extrapolated to preschool children with ADHD.  There are some indications that the effect size may be reduced ( Greenhill et al. 2006 ).  There may also be differences in the safety and 
pharmacokinetic profiles ( Wigal et al. 2007;  Wigal et al. 2006).
Generating long-term safety data in this population will provide important information on the use of SPD489 in the preschool ADHD population.
2.2 Study Objectives
2.2.1 Primary Objectives
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of SPD489 
administered as a daily morning dose (5, 10, 15, 20, and 30mg/day) in preschool children (4-5 years of age inclusive) diagnosed with ADHD.
The evaluation of safety and tolerability will be based on the occurrence of TEAEs, specific 
evaluation of blood pressure, pulse, weight, height, clinical laboratory evaluations and ECG results, and sleep assessments.

•To describe the long-term efficacy of SPD489 using global clinical measures of improvement, as measured by [CONTACT_87791]-I.
3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Study Design and Flow Chart
Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled in this long-term, open-label study to evaluate 
safety and tolerability of SPD489, administered as a daily morning dose in the treatment of 
children 4-5 years of age with ADHD. SPD489 will be provided in 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30mg capsules. 
This study will enroll subjects who participated in an antecedent SPD489 study (SPD489-211 
or SPD489-347). Subjects entering into this study will be classified as either an “A” Subject or a “B” Subject, determined by [CONTACT_822084]489 dose, defined as follows: 
•“A” Subjects are subjects on a known dose of SPD489, classified as subjects who 
completed the final visit of the treatment phase of an unblinded antecedent study (SPD489-211) who are directly entering this study ≤[ADDRESS_1139625] dose of study medication in the previous study.  
•“B” Subjects are subjects who require dose titration, classified as subjects who completed 
at least the dose optimization and follow up of the blinded antecedent study (SPD489-347) 
OR those subjects who completed the final visit of the treatment phase of the unblinded antecedent study (SPD489-211) and did not enroll in this study within 3 days.  
For “B” Subjects, screening assessments (physical examination, vital signs, height, weight, clinical laboratory tests, and ECGs) must be repeated for this study if more than [ADDRESS_1139626] 
elapsed since the conclusion of the antecedent study.  
During the Dose Maintenance Period for both “A” and “B” Subjects, the investigator may 
make further dose adjustments based upon TEAEs and clinical judgment.

6. Subject has lived with the same parent or guardian for ≥6 months.
4.2 Exclusion Criteria
Subjects are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria are met at Visit 0 for “A” 
Subjects or at Screening (Visit -1) and/or Visit 0 for “B” Subjects. These criteria apply to all subjects regardless of duration since participation in an antecedent trial.
1. Subject was terminated from an antecedent SPD489 trial for non-compliance and/or 
experienced a SAE or AE resulting in termination from any previous SPD489 trial.
2. Subject experienced any clinically significant AEs in any previous SPD489 trial that, in

3. Subject is required to or anticipates the need to take medications that have central nervous 
system effects or affect performance, such as sedating antihistamines and decongestant 
sympathomimetics, or are monoamine oxidase inhibitors.  Stable use of bronchodilator inhalers is not exclusionary.
4. Subject has a concurrent chronic or acute illness (such as severe allergic rhinitis or an 
infectious process requiring antibiotics), disability, or other condition that might confound the results of safety a ssessments conducted in the study or that might increase risk to the 
subject.  Similarly, the subject will be excluded if he or she has any additional condition(s) that, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], would prohibit the subject from completing the study or would not be in the best interest of the subject.  The additional condition(s) would include any significant illness or unstable medical condition that could lead to difficulty complying with the protocol.  Mild, stable asthma is not exclusionary.
5. Subject has a documented allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to amphetamine or to 
any excipi[INVESTIGATOR_38852].
6. Subject has a known family history of sudden cardiac death or ventricular arrhythmia.

diagnosis of Tourette’s Disorder.
12. Subject has a chronic or current tic disorder that is judged by [CONTACT_412596].
13. Subject is taking any medication that is excluded per the protocol.
14. For “B” Subjects only: Subject had any clinically significant ECG or clinical laboratory 
abnormalities at the Screening Visit (Visit -1).
15. For “B” Subjects only: Subject has current abnormal thyroid function, defined as 
abnormal TSH and T4 at the Screening Visit (Visit -1) or Visit 0.  Treatment with a stable 
dose of thyroid medication for at least [ADDRESS_1139633] at any time (e.g., in the interest of subject safet y).  T he investigator is 
encouraged to discuss withdrawal of a subject from investigational product with the medical 
monitor when possible.
If investigational product is discontinued, regardless of the reason, the evaluations listed for 
the Safety/Follow-up visit are to be performed as  completely as possible.  Whe never possible, 
all discontinued subjects should also undergo the protocol-specified follow-up.  Comments (spontaneous or elicited) or complaints made by [CONTACT_822087] [ADDRESS_1139634] be 
further evaluated if they meet any of the criteria defined in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] a nd [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure
Blood pressure criteria for further evaluation have been developed based on the normative 
data presented in the National Institutes for Health Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents ( 2005).
Increases in blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) from the 50
thto the 95thpercentile 
(representative of a change of [ADDRESS_1139635] deviations) range from 17-20 mmHg for both boys and girls in this age range.  Based on this range, an increase of >15mmHg from Visit 0 was selected for this protocol.
If there are elevations in the average (of 3 readings with approximately 2 minutes between 
readings) systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure based on the criteria defined below further assessment will be required:  
•Elevations in average (of 3 readings) sitting systolic blood pressure defined as an increase 
of >15 mmHg from Visit 0 of the antecedent study  for “A” Subjects or Visit 0 for “B” 
Subjects or an average (of 3 readings) sitting systolic blood pressure value ≥95th 
percentile for age, sex, and height percentile
•Elevations in average (of 3 readings) sitting diastolic blood pressure defined as an increase 
of >15 mmHg from Visit 0 of the antecedent study for “A” Subjects or Visit 0 for “B” 
Subjects or an average (of 3 readings) sitting diastolic blood pressure value ≥95th 
percentile for age, sex, and height percentile
The investigator will discuss each subject meeting any criterion with the medical monitor, and a joint decision between the investigator and the medical monitor will be made regarding dose reduction and continued participation in the study. If the dose has been previously decreased, or if the subject is already at the lowest dose, then the subject will be immediately 
discontinued from the study.
If the subject is allowed to remain in the study, an unscheduled visit will be conducted the 
next business day. If a visit cannot be conducted the next day, the subject may be 
discontinued from the study.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1139636] with a systolic or diastolic blood pressure measurement <95th percentile for age, 
sex, and height percentile may be discontinued from the study based upon the clinical judgment of the investigator regarding the subject’s safety.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pulse
The resting pulse rate criterion for further evaluation has been defined based on the normative 
data presented in the National Health Statistics Reports “Resting Pulse Rate Reference Data 
for Children, Adolescents, and Adults: [LOCATION_002], 1999 -2008.”
Elevations in the average (of 3 readings) sitting pulse, defined as 126 beats per minute (bpm) -equivalent to the [ADDRESS_1139637] be 
discontinued from the study.

5. PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT TREATMENT
All non-study treatment (including but not limited to herbal treatments, vitamins, behavioral treatment, non-pharmacological treatment, such as psychotherapy) received since the subject’s last visit in the antecedent study and through the final study contact (including protocol-defined follow-up period) must be recorded on the appropriate CRF page. 
5.1 Prior Treatment
Prior treatment includes all treatment (including but not limited to herbal treatments, vitamins, 
behavioral treatment, non-pharmacological treatment, such as psychotherapy) received within 30 days (or pharmacokinetic equivalent of 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) prior to the date of first dose of investigational product.

6.2.3 Dosing
Dosing should begin at approximately 7:00AM (+/-2 hours) on the morning after Visit 0. 
Subjects will be instructed to take 1 capsule daily in the morning throughout the study, at 
approximately the same time each day. The same parent/LAR should be available daily to dispense the dose of investigational product for the study duration. 
SPD489 will be administered one of the following ways: 
•swallow SPD489 capsule whole, or
•open capsule, empty and mix the entire contents with either yogurt, water or orange juice.
The contents should be mixed until completely dispersed. The subject must ingest the entire 
amount of mixture immediately within [ADDRESS_1139650] from the open-label antecedent study (SPD489-211) will enter this study on their 
optimal dose, if entering this study within [ADDRESS_1139651] is entering this study from the double-blind antecedent study (SPD489-347), or the subject does not immediately enter following the dose maintenance period of the unblinded study (SPD489-211), then the 
subject will begin dosing at 5mg of SPD489 and should be titrated in a stepwise fashion until an optimal dose is reached. 
The objective of dose optimization during the first 6 weeks for “B” Subjects is to ensure that 
subjects are titrated to an optimal dose of study drug based on TEAEs and clinical criteria.
The Investigator will categorize subject response into [ADDRESS_1139652] 4 weeks until an “acceptable response” is achieved.
•Intolerable response
(i.e., subject experiences intolerable side effects): This response 
suggests tapering the subject to a lower dose of investigational product (if available).
However, if this lower dose also produces an intolerable effect, the subject should be discontinued from the study.
•Ineffective response
(i.e., subject has not achieved at least a 30% reduction in 
ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version Total Score from Baseline (Visit 0) of the antecedent study and a CGI-I score of 1 or 2): This response suggests titrating the subject to the next available dose of investigational product (if available, provided there are no tolerability issues).
•Acceptable response
(i.e., subject has achieved at least a 30% reduction in ADHD-RS-IV 
Preschool Version Total Score from Baseline (Visit 0) of the antecedent study and a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 with tolerable side effects): This response suggests that an optimal dose has been achieved and the subject should maintain this dose for the remainder of the study.

Further, if the “acceptable” dose is well tolerated and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_107832], the 
subject may potentially receive additional symptom reduction, the dose may be increased to the next dose strength.
Dosing will continue at the protocol specified doses of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30mg for all subjects 
for the duration of the trial.  Subjects who turn [ADDRESS_1139654](s) container.

[IP_ADDRESS] Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV Preschool Version
The ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version (McGoey et al. 2007) , the secondary efficacy measure, 
is completed by [CONTACT_822093] 1 
and each subsequent visit up to and including the End of Study Visit to capture the ADHD symptoms within each study  period.  The ADHD -RS-IV Preschool Version was adapted from 
the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (DuPaul et al. 1998 ) and provides examples appropriate for the 
developmental level of preschool children.  The ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version is an 18-item questionnaire that requires the respondent to rate the frequency of occurrence of ADHD symptoms as defined by [CONTACT_2681]-IV-TR criteria.  Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often) with total scores ranging from 0-54.  The 18 items may be grouped into 2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and inattentiveness (odd numbered items 1-17).
The ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version will be completed by a clinician trained and 
experienced in the evaluation of preschool children with ADHD.  Since the ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version is used to guide dosing decisions, if it is not completed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_54720]-Investigator who is medically/clinically responsible for the subject, it must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_476]. All individuals performing this assessment must be pre-approved by [CONTACT_822094].
The title, version, and date of the ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version used in this study are 
included in Table [ADDRESS_1139679] 2014

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Global Impressions
The CGI Scale (Guy 1976 ) permits a global evaluation of the subject’s severity and 
improvement over time.  The CGI has been used extensively in clinical studies of ADHD 
(Michelson et al. 2001 ; Weiss et al. 2005; Wilens et al. 2001) .
The Investigator will perform the CGI-S to rate the severity of a subject’s condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill subjects) at Visit [ADDRESS_1139680] to ADHD 
symptoms.
At each visit from Visit 1 up to and including Visit 13/ET (for “A” Subjects) and Visit 18/ET
(for “B” Subjects), the Investigator will assess the subject’s improvement relative to the 3 target areas of improvement recorded at Visit 0 of the antecedent study, on the CGI-I, a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).
The CGI-I should be completed by a clinician trained and experienced in the evaluation of 
preschool children with ADHD.  Since the CGI-I is used to guide dosing decisions, if it is not 
completed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_54720]-Investigator who is medically/clinically responsible for the subject, it must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_476]. All individuals performing this assessment must be pre-approved by [CONTACT_822094].
The title, version, and date of the CGI-I used in this study are included in Table 1andTable [ADDRESS_1139681] party vendor (e.g., clinical laboratory) used in this study 
will be maintained in the investigator’s and sponsor’s files.

•Cardiovascular.
Abnormalities identified at the Screening Visit (Visit -1) will be documented in the subject’s 
source documents and on the medical history CRF.  Changes after the Screening Visit (Visit -1) will be captured as AEs on the AE CRF page, as deemed by [CONTACT_093].
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Collection
At each study visit, subjects will be questioned in a general way to ascertain if AEs have 
occurred since the previous visit (e.g., “Have you had any health problems since your last 
visit?”).  Adverse events are collected from the time informed consent is signed. Any AE 
ongoing from the antecedent study must be entered. Any AE ongoing from the antecedent study must be recorded on the CRF for this study. (Please refer to Section 8, Adverse and 
Serious Adverse Events Assessment.)

Blood pressure will be determined by [CONTACT_344318] (the same unit and the same arm should 
be used throughout the study).  A blood pressure cuff appropriate for the subject’s arm length 
and girth should be used for all blood pressure measurements.  The cuff should be approximately two-thirds the length/width of the subject’s arm (from elbow to shoulder).  All blood pressure measurements should be performed throughout the study using the unit 
provided by [CONTACT_461665].  The automated cuff will obtain 3 measurements with 
approximately 2 minutes in between each collection for blood pressure and pulse and report the average of the 3 measurements for each parameter.  The 3 individual measurements and the averaged reading should be recorded in the source and CRF.
Any clinically significant deviations from Baseline (Visit 0) vital signs which are deemed 
clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_73601].
[IP_ADDRESS] Height and Weight
Height will be captured at each visit for all subjects. A calibrated stadiometer must be used for 
all height measurements.  Height should be measured in inches or centimeters without shoes with the subject standing on a flat surface and with chin parallel to the floor. The body should be straight but not rigid.
Weight will be captured at each visit to the site. The same calibrated scale must be used for all 
weight measurements. Weight should be measured in pounds or kilograms without shoes.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Evaluations
All clinical laboratory assays will be performed according to the laboratory’s normal 
procedures.  Reference ranges are to be supplied by [CONTACT_108487]-of-range pathological changes.  The investigator should assess out-of-range clinical laboratory values for clinical significance, indicating if the value(s) is/are not clinically significant or clinically significant.  Abnormal clinical laboratory values, which are unexpected or not explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical condition, may, at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor, be repeated as soon as possible until confirmed, explained, or resolved.
Clinical laboratory assessments for “A” Subjects will be performed at Visit 0, Visit 6, and 
Visit 13/ET. While the Clinical Laboratory assessments for “B” Subjects will be performed at 
the Screening Visit (Visit -1), Visit 9, Visit 16, and Visit 18/ET.  Additionally, clinical laboratory tests are required to be repeated prior to Visit [ADDRESS_1139685] elapsed since the clinical laboratory assessments completed as part of the Screening Visit (Visit -1) were performed.

Additionally, for “B” Subjects, a 12-lead ECG is required to be r epeated prior to Visit [ADDRESS_1139688] elapsed since the 12-lead ECG completed as part of the Screening Visit (Visit -1) was performed.Additional ECGs may be performed during the study at the Investigator’s discretion.
All ECGs will be performed after [ADDRESS_1139689] using the central ECG provider’s 
equipment and will be sent to the central ECG provider electronically.
The initial interpretation of the ECG, normal or abnormal and clinical significance, will be 
performed immediately after collection to ensure the safety of each subject.  An ECG tracing will then be evaluated by a cardiologist at a central ECG reading vendor and returned to the site with a determination of normal or abnormal.  Upon review of the report from this vendor, the Investigator will re-evaluate the clinical significance of the ECG while taking into consideration all other safety data available for the subject.
Although a central ECG reader is being used for this study, the eligibility of the subject is 
based on the Investigator’s assessment of the ECG.  If abnormal and significant results are observed following assessment by [CONTACT_9251], the Investigator, in consultation with the 
appointed CRO Medical Monitor, reconfirms subject eligibility to continue.
All ECGs transmitted to the central ECG reader will be analyzed.  If the central ECG reader 
receives multiple ECGs, the first readable ECGs will be analyzed as the scheduled ECG. Every ECG transmitted to the central ECG reader will have corresponding CRF data collected. No ECG should be deleted by [CONTACT_26271]. All ECGs must be transmitted to the central provider regardless of quality, results, or number of ECGs taken at a respective visit.

[IP_ADDRESS] Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire and Sleep Diary 
The CSHQ is a tool designed to screen for the most common sleep problems in children, and 
consists of 33 items for scoring and several extra items intended to provide administrators with other potentially useful information about respondents. The instrument evaluates the child’s sleep based on behavior within 8 different subscales: bedtime resistance, sleep-onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night wakings, parasomnias, sleep-disordered breathing, and daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. The CSHQ will be completed at every visit to the site starting with

[IP_ADDRESS] Suitability of the Subject to Remain in the Study
At each visit (except for Visit 13/ET or Visit 18/ET) starting with the Visit 1, the Investigator 
or a medically qualified designee should assess whether it remains in the best interest of the 
subject to continue in the study and that it is safe for the subject to do so.  As part of the assessment of the subject’s suitability to remain in the study the Investigator should assess the subject’s current potential for suicide, suicidal ideation, self-harm, or harm to others, as well as psychiatric disorders.  The Investigator should make this assessment by [CONTACT_14664] a clinical interview with the subject and by [CONTACT_38908], including results of the C-SSRS.  The Investigator should also ensure that there is appropriate 
documentation of this assessment in the subject’s source notes.  As part of this assessment, if appropriate, the Investigator should discuss risk factors for suicide with the subject.  Where a subject has suffered an accidental injury, the Investigator should ensure that this was a true accidental injury, rather than an epi[INVESTIGATOR_571018]-harming or a suicide attempt.
The subject’s source notes should clearly document that the assessment of continued 
suitability including an assessment of the subject’s current potential risk of suicide, suicidal 
ideation, feelings of hopelessness, drug use, self-harm, or harm to others has taken place and should contain the decision on whether the subject is suitable to continue in the study.
The Investigator should pay particular attention to:
•Any “yes” response to items 2, 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_1139693]’s source notes.

8. ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS ASSESSMENT
8.[ADDRESS_1139697] a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (ICH Guidance E2A 1995).  
All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent is signed until the defined follow-up 
period stated in Section 7.1.3.  This includes events occurring during the screening phase of 
the study, regardless of whether or not investigational product is administered.  Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of sy mptoms should be recorded.  If a diagnosis has not 
been made, then each symptom should be listed individually.  All AEs should be captured on the appropriate AE pages in the CRF and in source documents.  In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the investigational product indication should also be captured on the AE CRF.
All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline 
status or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study.  Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained.  When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) can be documented.
8.1.[ADDRESS_1139698] be recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dyspepsia prior to dosing of investigational product, but the dyspepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose of investigational product has been administered, a new AE of severe dyspepsia [with the appropriate date of onset] is recorded on the appropriate CRF).
Shire CONFIDENTIAL [ADDRESS_1139699] 2014
Protocol SPD489-348 Version 1.0, FINAL Page 62 of 87
The medical assessment of severity is determined by [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:
Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment 
or therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention.  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject.
Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.
8.1.2 Relationship Categorization
A physician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product 
for each AE.  The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is 
a reasonable possibility t hat the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  
If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related”.  Otherwise, if there is any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause-and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”.  The causality assessment must be documented in the source document.
The following additional guidance may be helpful:
Term Relationship Definition
RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the 
investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response 
pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident.
Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s underlying 
medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible tem poral or 
biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event.
8.1.[ADDRESS_1139700] be recorded during the course of the study on the  CRF.  Outcomes 
are as follows:
• Fatal
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved

Protocol SPD489-348 Version 1.0, FINAL Page 63 of 87
• Recovered/Resolved
• Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae 
• Recovering/Resolving
• Unknown.
8.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease Under Study
Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classed as AEs as long as they are within 
the normal day-to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the 
efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the symptoms should be recorded as an AE.
8.1.[ADDRESS_1139702] to the start of study treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible explanation (e.g., concomitant disease) is found for the 
abnormal values.
The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinically significant and therefore represents an AE.
8.1.6 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the 
sponsor according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they result in an AE/SAE as described in Section  8.2.  Note: The 24-hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply 
to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. 
The categories below are not mutually exclusive; the event can meet more than [ADDRESS_1139703] 2014
Protocol SPD489-348 Version 1.0, FINAL Page 64 of 87
• Abuse Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used 
for a non-medical purpose (e.g., to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a 
manner that may be detrimental to the individual and/or society
• Misuse Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at 
any dose (Note: this includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as directed at the dose prescribed by [CONTACT_760])
• Overdose Intentional or unintentional intake of a dose of an investigational product 
exceeding a pre-specified total daily dose of 30mg of the product
• Medication Error An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or 
use of an investigational product.  For studies, medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined below.
Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigational product are not considered reportable as medication errors.
Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation.The administration and/or use of an expi[INVESTIGATOR_10151] a 
reportable medication error.
All investigational product provided to pediatric subjects should be supervised by [CONTACT_31588]/legally-authorized representative/caregiver.

they result in an SAE. 
The investigator must complete, sign, and date the Shire Clinical Trial Serious Adverse Event 
Form and verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the form with the corresponding 
source documents (Note:  Source documents are not to be sent unless requested) and fax or 
e-mail the form to the Shire Pharmacovigilance Department. A copy of the Shire Clinical

the CRO/Shire Medical Monitor using the details specified in the emergency contact [CONTACT_1739].
8.2.[ADDRESS_1139707] medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to 
investigational product or not) that at any dose:
•Results in death
•Is life-threatening.  Note: The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of “serious” refers 
to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which hy pothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which are the result of elective or previously scheduled surgery for pre-existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be classified as SAEs.  For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73607](s) serious 
criteria must be reported as SAE(s).
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect
•Is an important medical event.  Note: Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent until the defined follow-up period stated in Section 7.1.3, and must be 
reported to the Shire Pharmacovigilance Department and
the CRO/Shire Medical Monitor 
within [ADDRESS_1139708] awareness of the event. 
In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by 
[CONTACT_822098] [ADDRESS_1139709]’s death (i.e., the SAE was noted as the primary cause of 
death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date.  For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded.
For any SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, the 
action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not changed” or 
“not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product).
8.2.[ADDRESS_1139710], Ethics Committee, and Site 
Reporting
The sponsor and the clinical CRO are responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory 
authorities and US central IRBs of related, unexpected SAEs.
In addition the sponsor and clinical CRO are responsible for notifying active sites of all 
related, unexpected SAEs occurring during all interventional studies across the SPD489program.  
The investigator is responsible for notifying the local IRB, local EC, or the relevant local 
regulatory authority of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required.
9. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS

reviews their medical records and data collected during the study.  These records and data may, in addition, be reviewed by [CONTACT_1774]: independent auditors who validate the data on behalf of the sponsor; third parties with whom the sponsor may develop, register, or market SPD489; national or local regulatory authorities; and the IRB(s)/EC(s)which gave approval for the study to proceed.  The sponsor and/or its representatives 
accessing the records and data will take all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities.
Subjects are assigned a unique identifying number; however, their initials and date of birth 
may also be collected and used to assist the sponsor to verify the accuracy of the data (e.g., to 
confirm that laboratory results have been assigned to the correct subject).
The results of studies containing subjects’ unique identifying number, relevant medical 
records, and possibly initials and dates of birth will be recorded.  They may be transferred to, 
and used in, other countries which may not afford the same level of protection that applies within the countries where this study is conducted.  The purpose of any such transfer would include: to support regulatory submissions, to conduct new data analyses to publish or present 
the study results, or to answer questions asked by [CONTACT_1775].
10.5 Study Results / Publication Policy
Shire will endeavor to publish the results of all qualifying, applicable, and covered studies 
according to external guidelines in a timely manner regardless of whether the outcomes are perceived as positive, neutral, or negative.  A dditionally, Shire adheres to external guidelines

intellectual property review, with Shire agreement to publish prior to release of information.  The review is aimed at protecting the sponsor’s proprietary information existing either at the commencement of the study or generated during the study.  To the extent permitted by [CONTACT_38927], the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_59702] (or share with other authors) the copyright on his/her publications.  To the extent that the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10159], joint or shared rights, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10160] a perpetual, irrevocable, ro yalty-free license to make and distribute copi[INVESTIGATOR_10161].
The term “publication” refers to any public disclosure including original research articles, review articles, oral presentations, abstracts and posters at medical congresses, journal 
supplements, letters to the editor, invited lectures, opi[INVESTIGATOR_10162], book chapters, electronic postings on medical/scientific websites, or other disclosure of the study results, in printed, electronic, oral or other form.
Subject to the terms of the paragraph below, the investigator shall have the right to publish the 
study results, and any background information provided by [CONTACT_822102], or necessary for other scholars to verify such study results.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no publication that incorporates the sponsor’s confidential information shall be submitted for publication without the sponsor’s prior written 
agreement to publish, and shall be given to the sponsor for review at least [ADDRESS_1139731] publication of the study results shall be 
made by [CONTACT_10208]’s presentation of a joint, multicenter publication of the compi[INVESTIGATOR_38865].  If such a multicenter publication is not submitted to a journal for publication by [CONTACT_10209] 18-month period after conclusion, abandonment, or termination of the study at all sites, or after the sponsor confirms there shall be no multicenter study publication of the study results, an investigator may 
individually publish the study results from the specific site in accordance with this section.  The investigator must, however, acknowledge in the publication the limitations of the single-site data being presented.
Unless otherwise required by [CONTACT_10210], or the forum in 
which it is made, authorship will comply with the ICMJE current standards.  Participation as an investigator does not confer any rights to authorship of publications.

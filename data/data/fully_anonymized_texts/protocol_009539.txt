Presurgical letrozole  [ADDRESS_282150] (and adjacent lymph nodes), and is surgically resectable and potentially 
curable.  Seventy-five percent of primar y breast tumors express estrogen receptor 
alpha (ER). Patients with Stage I-III ER-positive breast cancer are typi[INVESTIGATOR_233758]- estrogen therapy for 5 years after surgical removal of 
the primary tumor. Among the cases of ER+ breast cancer, ~10% harbor genomic 
amplification of the ERBB2  (HER2) proto-oncogene; patients with HER2+ cancer 
are treated with HER2-directed therapy, a nd will not be part of this study. This 
study focuses on patients with Stag e I-III ER+/HER2- breast cancer. 
 
1.2. The presurgical study model  
An initial diagnosis of breast cancer is typi[INVESTIGATOR_233759] a tissue biopsy specimen. Patients with Stage I-III cancer will 
then typi[INVESTIGATOR_233760] a few weeks to remove the primary tumor(s).  Therefore, it is common to have a paired tumor biopsy specimen and a surgical tumor specimen.  The availability of such paired specimens has prompted 
a large initiative in recent years to treat patients ( e.g., with drug) during the 
intervening period between the time of diagnostic biopsy and the time of surgery. 
We can then compare the biopsy tissue (baseline, pre-treatment) to the surgical tissue (post-treatment) to assess biological changes ( e.g., changes in mRNA and 
protein expression).  This study design has provided a wealth of information on 
the effects of systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_233761] [reviewed in ref. ( 1)], and it 
requires no additional biopsy procedure. 
 1.3. Therapeutic inhibition of mTORC1  
mTORC1 is a molecular hub that integrat es signaling inputs from an array of 
sources, including growth factor recepto r signaling pathways, nutrient sensing 
pathways, and energy sensing pathwa ys. Activated mTORC1 promotes cap-
dependent protein translation, and this pathway is hyperactivated in many cancer 
types. As such, mTORC1 is an attractive therapeutic target. The mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001 (Afinitor, Everolimus) was recently approved for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic ER +/HER2- breast cancer in combination 
with the steroidal aromatase inhibito r Exemestane following progression on a 
non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (Letrozo le, Anastrozole). Everolimus is also 
approved for the treatment of other non- breast malignancies. While the phase 3 
BOLERO-2 study demonstrated that Exemestane/Everolimus increased 
progression-free survival compared to Exemestane/Placebo ( 2), nearly all patients 
eventually progressed. Genetic analysis has not identified a clear, individual 
biomarker that predicted benefit from Everolimus ( 3). Furthermore, it is unclear

Fig. 2. Anti-estrogen-mediated inhibition of ER with  fulvestrant abrogates PI3K/AKT activation induced 
by [CONTACT_218525]1 inhibition with RAD001. Left: MCF-7 cells were pre-treated with medium containing 10% 
FBS ± 1 M fulvestrant for 24 hours. Then cells were treated with medium ± 1 M fulvestrant ± 20 nM 
RAD001 for 24 hours before lysis. Lysates were  analyzed by [CONTACT_233767]. Right : ZR75-1 cells were pre-treated with medium containing 10% FBS ± 1 M fulvestrant for 
3 days. Then cells were treated with medium ± 1 M fulvestrant ± 20 nM RAD001 for 24 hours before 
lysis. Lysates were analyzed as in  (A). Note that RAD001 treatment decreases P-S6 (marker of mTORC1 
activity) but increases P-AKT. Fulv estrant treatment decreases IRS-[ADDRESS_282155] cancer requiring mastectomy, to four mont hs of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy 
with either letrozole or tamoxifen.  Sixt y percent of subjects receiving presurgical 
letrozole had an objective radiologic re sponse and 48% were able to undergo 
breast-conserving surgery, while only 41% of subjects receiving tamoxifen had an 
objective response and 36% were able to undergo breast-conserving surgery ( 12).  
The Ki-67 proliferation biomarker can be assayed at diagnosis and again after a 
short run-in period of treatment with letrozole, and Ellis showed that suppression of Ki-67 with persistent expression of  ER in a node negative patient with a 
primary tumor under 5 cm in size is predic tive of such a low risk of recurrence 
that adjuvant chemotherapy is obviated ( 13).  [ADDRESS_282156] cancer were randomized to 
receive letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane for 16 to 18 weeks prior to surgery.  The clinical response rate to letrozole was 75% versus 69% for anastrozole and 63% for exemestane.  51% of the pati ents who were j udged to require a 
mastectomy at the time of study registration were able to achieve breast preservation ( 14).  Neoadjuvant endocrine ther apy can therefore increase the 
likelihood of achieving breast preservation in a woman with a locally advanced 
hormone receptor positive breast cancer , and biopsies after a brief treatment 
interval have provided biomarkers whic h were predictive of prolonged disease-
free survival with endocrine therapy alone . Letrozole is an active agent in the 
neoadjuvant setting and can be considered  an appropriate standard of care as 
neoadjuvant therapy for locally  advanced breast cancer. 
 1.6. Study rationale 
 
We propose a presurgical study in patient s with Stage I-III ER+/HER2- breast 
cancer to determine whether anti-estr ogen therapy (Letrozole) suppresses 
mTORC1 inhibitor (RAD001)-induced activ ation of PI3K/AKT signaling. As the 
primary objective is to determine whethe r anti-estrogen ther apy alters mTORC1 
inhibitor-induced signaling that can be assessed in a short time frame ex vivo , we 
will treat patients with or without Letrozol e for 10-21 days prior to surgery; this 
time frame will allow sufficient time for maximal estrogen suppression and 
downstream changes in the levels of ER-regulated transcripts and encoded 
Presurgical letrozole  9 
 
proteins. Viable core samples of surgically resected tumors will be used for ex 
vivo culture to assess the effects of RAD001 on signaling, to avoid exposing 
subjects to potentially adverse side e ffects of RAD001. Findings from this study 
will provide mechanistic insight into the effects of mTORC1 and ER inhibition on 
oncogenic signaling pathways in cancer cells.

primary breast tumor]. 
  
4.0 REGISTRATION 
Patients will be registered by [CONTACT_233770]-treatment evaluations 
and informed consent. At the time of regi stration, the following information will be 
recorded: 
 - Patient's name [CONTACT_233792]. 
 - Patient's date of birth.  - Date of treatment start. Eligibility criteria will be verified at the time of regi stration. A case number will be 
assigned following registration.    
 
Presurgical letrozole  [ADDRESS_282158] on surgical planning. This 
period will be up to 4 weeks prior to th e start of presurgical treatment with 
Letrozole for subjects enrolled onto Ar m B (this time period does not apply to 
Arm A).  
5.2 Treatment Period 
Patients will receive either A) no presur gical drug treatment, or B) presurgical 
treatment with Letrozole for 10-[ADDRESS_282159] until accrual is full (n=10). Following successful completion of molecular analyses to support the first primary objective (To determine whether mTORC1 inhibition with RAD001 in creases IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway 
activation in ER+/HER2- breast tumors ex vivo ), we will proceed to enroll 
patients in Arm B (presurgical Letrozol e, as below in Section 5.2.2).  An 
estimated 10 subjects will be enrolled into Arm B to obtain the necessary evaluable number of subjects (n=10).  
 
5.2.1. Surgery and tumor specimens 
The patient will undergo definitive su rgical resection of the primary 
tumor. Management of the axilla will be left to the judgment of the surgical oncologist and the patient.  It is strongly preferred that surg ery be scheduled between Monday and 
Thursday for optimal timing of tissue fixation and processing.  
 The Pathologist will promptly dissect the surgical primary tumor specimen. ASCO-CAP guidelines require  initiation of dissection of a 
surgical specimen within 1 hour of removal from the patient; for this 
study, minimal “cold ischemia time” is preferred.   The Pathologist will assess whether the tumor specimen is large enough to 
procure:    A. tissue for routine diagnostics    B. ≥8 core punch biopsies that ar e 1 mm in diameter and ≥0.5 cm long 
for research 
Presurgical letrozole  12 
 
   C. ≥4 core punch biopsies that ar e 3 mm in diameter and ≥0.25 cm long 
for research  A 2-cm tumor is expected to provide  sufficient material for all needs. 
 When the tumor is sufficiently large to provide adequate tissue ( e.g., >3 
cm), the Pathologist will first remove core punch biopsies for this research study using 1-mm and 3-mm punch biopsy devices.  All research samples 
must be acquired within 1.5 hours of  tissue removal from the patient; 
a shorter lag time is strongly preferred to maximize tissue viability.  
The Pathologist will then acquire ti ssue samples for routine diagnostics. 
 If the tumor specimen is approximately [ADDRESS_282160] procure tissue for routine diagnostics. Then if adequate tumor tissue remains to provide punch biopsies for research purposes, these samples will be taken from the tumor. If the tumor is too small to provide adequate tissue for research, the tumor will be  considered non-evaluable and the 
patient will need to be replaced.  Punch biopsy tumor specimens required fo r this research study are listed 
below in order of priority.  A) Fresh tissue (n=8) -  Using a 1-mm  punch biopsy device with plunger 
(provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Miller), remove 8 tumor samples ≥0.5 cm long. These 
samples will be immediately  placed into cold (0-4°C) tissue culture 
medium (serum-free DMEM + Pen/Stre p; provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Miller to be 
kept on-hand in Pathology lab) and ke pt on ice or refrigerated (0-4°C). 
These tissues will be transported within [ADDRESS_282161]. 
Miller’s lab on the 6th floor of Rubin Research  Building. Jennifer Bean, 
Wei Yang, and Todd Miller (members  of the Miller lab) will be 
responsible for transporting tissues, a nd need to be contact[CONTACT_233771]. They will be paged when tumor tissues are available for pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-up. 
 B) Frozen tissue (n=2) -  Using a 3-mm  punch biopsy device  with plunger 
(provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Miller), remove 2 tumor samples ≥ 0.25 cm long, put 
into cryotubes (1 core per tube), an d snap-freeze in li quid nitrogen. Liquid 
nitrogen can be provided in a small c ontainer by [CONTACT_233772], if they are 
notified early on the day of surgery.  C) Formalin-fixed (FFPE) tissue (n=2)  - Using the same 3-mm  punch 
biopsy device, remove 2 tumor samples ≥ 0.25 cm long, fix in formalin (3 
hours to overnight), and paraffin-embed the next day as per standard tissue 
processing procedures in Pathology lab. Alternatively, if Pathology will be processing diagnostic FFPE tumor 
samples that will provide sufficient excess tissue for molecular analyses, 
Presurgical letrozole  13 
 
and tissues are fixed for less than 24 hours, then such samples may be 
used in lieu of punch biopsies.  D) Extra tumor tissue-  If tissue requirements for categories A, B, and C 
are filled and excess tumor tissue is available, more 1-mm cores of fresh 
viable tissue for tissue culture are re quested (up to 20 more). Such extra 
cores should be placed into tissue cult ure medium as in section A (above). 
 Histological qualification of tumor samples- The Pathologist will perform routine histological anal ysis of the diagnostic FFPE surgical tumor 
specimen. If the diagnostic  tumor sa mple is found to have <50% tumor 
cellularity, the tumor samples procured for research will be considered non-evaluable, and this patient will need to be replaced. 
 
5.2.2. Presurgical Letrozole 
Patients enrolled on Arm B will be treated with Letrozole (2.5 mg/day, 
administered orally) for 10-[ADDRESS_282162] time frame in presurgical 
studies with aromatase inhibitors in patients with ER+ breast cancer. This 
drug and dose are given as standard adjuvant therapy for up to 5 years following surgical removal of a primary ER+/HER2- breast tumor in patients with Stage I-III disease.  Th e final dose of Le trozole should be 
taken on the morning of surgery. 
 
It is strongly preferred that surg ery be scheduled between Monday and 
Thursday for optimal timing of tissue fixation and processing. 
 
The primary tumor will be surgica lly resected as in Section 5.2.1. The 
Pathologist will promptly dissect the surgical tumor specimen, and obtain punch biopsies for this study as in Section 5.2.1.  
5.2.3. Letrozole drug information  
Letrozole (4,4'-(1H-1,2,4-Triazol-1-ylmet hylene)bis-benzonitrile) is a syn-
thetic achiral benzydryltrizole derivativ e. It is an orally active highly 
selective, non-steroidal competitive inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme system ( 15, 16 ). Aromatase inhibitors block the aromatase enzyme, 
consequently lowering estrogen levels and thereby [CONTACT_233773]. Letrozole effec tively inhibits the conversion of 
androgens to estrogens in both in vitro and in vivo (15).  This property 
makes it in particular suitable for postmenopausal women whose main source of estrogen is via peripheral ar omatization of androgen precursors. 
 
Preclinical and pharmacodynamic data in humans 
In vivo , in female rats, the aromatase inhibition manifests itself in a 
reduction in uterine weight, an incr ease in body weight, a decrease in 
serum estradiol concentration, an in crease in plasma LH concentration 
Presurgical letrozole  14 
 
(16, 17 ) and suppression of the growth of DMBA-induced rat mammary 
tumors ( 15, 18 ). The ED50 values for some of these effects lie in the range 
of 0.001 to 0.03 mg/kg with maximal e ndocrine and anti-tumor efficacy in 
the dose range of 0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg po ( 18). 
 Comparison to Aminoglutethimide (AG) Letrozole is up to 150-[ADDRESS_282163] generation 
aromatase inhibitor AG, in vitro and more than 10,000 times as potent as 
AG in inhibiting aromatase in vivo (15). The high potency  of letrozole is 
not accompanied by [CONTACT_233774] e ffect on adrenal steroidogenesis in 
vitro or in vivo over its maximally effective dose range ( 16, 17 ). Inhibition 
of adrenal steroidogenesis resulting in  adrenal hypertrophy does occur 
with therapeutic doses of AG. Th e high potency a nd selectivity of  
letrozole explains its ph armacological profile and high therapeutic index. 
 
Activity in breast cancer patients 
In postmenopausal patients with advan ced breast cancer, daily doses of 0.1 
to 5 mg letrozole suppressed plasma levels of estradiol, estrone and estrone sulfate to 75-95% from baseline ( 15, 19 ).  Estrogen suppression 
was maintained throughout the treatmen t period of 28 days in all patients. 
 Selectivity of letrozole Letrozole is a highly selective inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme. No clinically relevant changes in the plasma levels of cortisol, aldosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, 17-hydroxyprogester one, ACTH or plasma renin 
activity were found in postmenopausal pa tients treated with  a daily dose of 
letrozole ranging from 0.1 to 5 mg ( 15, 20, 21 ). Synacthen7 tests 
performed after 6 weeks of treatmen t with daily doses  of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 
2.5 and 5 mg letrozole indicated no atte nuation of aldostero ne or cortisol 
production ( 22). 
 Toxicities of letrozole Most adverse reactions to le trozole in the literature are mild to moderate in 
severity and are indistinguishable fro m the consequences of the patient’s 
metastatic breast cancer, the effects of estrogen deprivation, or other 
concurrent illness.  Reported events in greater than 5%  of subjects incl ude chest pain, 
hypertension, edema, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, increased  appetite, constipation, diarrhea, 
weight gain, weight loss, bone fractures , arthralgias, arthritis, back pain, 
bone pain, breast pain, myalgias, weakness, asthenia, dizziness, 
depression, fatigue, headache, inso mnia, lethargy, malaise, rash, hot 
flashes, sweats, vaginal bleeding, vaginal dryness, and infections. 
 
Presurgical letrozole  [ADDRESS_282164]’s oncology provider and the 
subject will be asked to fill the pr escription at her commercial pharmacy. 
 
5.3 Study exit 
Following surgery, the patient’s role in  the study will end. The patient will 
then be treated as per standard-of-ca re by [CONTACT_233775]. Subjects 
who begin letrozole in the pre-surgi cal setting may receive chemotherapy 
followed by [CONTACT_233776].  
 
5.4. Evaluable patients 
Subjects who proceed to a definitive surg ical procedure with A) tumor tissue 
sufficient to provide punch biopsy specimens for research purposes, and B) histologically-confirmed tumor tissue in the surgical specimen with ≥50% tumor 
cellularity, will be considered evaluabl e. Subjects whose surgical specimens do 
not contain adequate tumo r tissue to assess the pr imary endpoint will not be 
considered evaluable, and will need to be replaced.  
5.5.  Analyses 
  5.5.1. Ex vivo analysis of RAD001 effe cts on IRS-1/PI3K/AKT signaling. 
Fresh viable tumor cores in tissue culture medium (serum-free DMEM + Pen/Strep) will be placed into me dium containing 20 nM RAD001 (4 
cores) or DMSO control (4 cores) a nd cultured at 37°C for 1 hour. If extra 
tissue cores are available, we will treat +/- 20 nM RAD001 for 2-8 hours 
to evaluate delayed changes in si gnaling, and treat +/- 1 uM OSI-906 
(IGF-1R/InsR inhibitor) for 1-8 hour s to determine whether PI3K/AKT 
signaling is IGF-1R/InsR-dependent in these tumors. Tissue cores will 
then be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. 
 Immunoblotting- Two cores each of DMSO- and RAD001-treated tumor 
will be homogenized and lysed on ice in RIPA buffer containing protease 
and phosphatase inhibitors. Samples w ill be sonicated and centrifuged, 
and supernatant will be used to qu antify protein concentration. Protein 
lysates for immunoblotting will then  be mixed with reducing sample 
buffer and stored at -80°C.  Lysates will be heated at 95°C for [ADDRESS_282165]:  IRS-1 phospho-IRS-1-Ser636/639 (mar ker of p70S6K activity)

If excess protein lysate  is available, we w ill immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_233762] p85 
subunit of PI3K, and immunoblot for IRS-1 and IRS-2 to assess drug 
induced changes in IRS-1/2-induced PI3K activation.  We will also immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_233763]-Tyro sine antibody, and immunoblot for 
IGF-1Rb, InsRb, IRS-1, and IRS-2 to assess protein activation. 
 
The primary goal of this analysis is to determine whether RAD001 
treatment ex vivo  globally decreases mTORC1 signaling (indicated by a 
decrease in levels of phospho- p70S6K, phospho-S6, and phospho-4E-
BP1), increases IRS-1/2 levels an d phosphorylation, and increases AKT 
phosphorylation. Secondary goals are to  assess changes in IGF-1R and 
InsR activation, and compensatory  signaling through the MEK/Erk 
pathway. 
 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on frozen  tissues- Two cores each of 
DMSO- and RAD001-treated tumor will be sectioned and processed for 
IHC in the Pathology Translational Re search Shared Resource. Tissue 
sections will be immunostained using antibodies against phospho-S6-
Ser240/244, phospho-AKT-S473, phospho-AKT-T308 and phospho-IGF-1Rb/InsR- Tyr1131/Tyr1146. Samples will  be scored using a Histoscore 
scale that incorporates stai ning intensity and frequency ( 12). 
 
The primary goal of this analysis is to determine whether RAD001 
treatment ex vivo  decreases mTORC1 signaling (indicated by a decrease in 
levels of phospho-S6) and increases AKT phosphorylation uniformly throughout tumor cores, and whether dr ug treatment alte rs IGF-1R/InsR 
phosphorylation (which cannot be asse ssed by [CONTACT_233777]). Staining intensities in the center of each core will be 
compared to the outer edges to assess uniformity of signal; non-uniformity may be due to time of exposure of cells to drug or medium. 
  5.5.2.  Immunohistochemical analysis of pre- vs. post-Letrozole tumors.  
Baseline (diagnostic core biopsy speci men) and post-Letrozole (surgical 
specimen) tumor samples will be sec tioned and processed for IHC in the 
Pathology Translational Research Shar ed Resource. Tissue sections will 
be immunostained using antibodies ag ainst ER, PR, and Ki67. ER and PR 
Presurgical letrozole  17 
 
will be scored using a Histoscore scale ( 23); we expect Letrozole 
treatment to decrease PR levels, while ER may be unaffected. Ki67 will be scored by [CONTACT_233778]-stained cells in 10 high-power (400x magnification) microscopic fields ( 24, 25 ). Pre- and post-
Letrozole Ki67+ cell counts will be compared by t-test; Letrozole treatment should induce an overa ll decrease in Ki67 score. 
 
The primary goal of this analysis is to determine whether changes in signaling induced by [CONTACT_233779]001 treatment ex vivo  are associated with Ki67 
score. A higher post-anti -estrogen Ki67 score, and a smaller decrease in 
Ki67 score in response to presurgical treatment with an anti-estrogen, are associated with shorter recurrence-free survival ( 26). Hence, it is thought 
that a higher level of residual tumor cell proliferation (h igher Ki67 score) 
following anti-estrogen treatment, or a weaker biological response (change 
in Ki67 score) to anti-estrogen treatm ent, are indicative of less dependence 
of tumor cells on ER for growth and su rvival. Our preclinical data indicate 
that ER drives IRS-1 and IGF-1R expression, which facilitate RAD001-
induced PI3K/AKT activation. Theref ore, in tumors that are less 
dependent upon ER, Letrozole treatment is expected to have less of an 
effect on IRS-1/PI3K/AKT signaling. Such findings would support the use 
of combinations of anti-estrogens and mTORC1 inhibitors in patients with 
ER-driven tumors. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_282166] of 
1996 (HIPAA). Participants will sign an aut horization that includes the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in 
this study 
• Who will have access to that information and why • Who will use or disclose that information • The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of 
their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subjec t revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the 
investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability  to use all information collected prior 
to the revocation of s ubject authorization. 
 
Loss of patient confidentiality is a risk  of participation.  Study participant 
identities will be kept confidential except as required by [CONTACT_2371].  Subjects’ samples 
will be identified by [CONTACT_233780] (i.e., linked, but de-identified).  Patient samples will be de-identified at the time and site  of collection.  Participant and study 
information will be kept in the Velos eResearch password-protected database or its equivalent.  Additionally, documents cont aining participant identifiers, such as 
those from the medical record to confirm eligibility, will be filed in binders and 
Presurgical letrozole  [ADDRESS_282167] s are maintained to allow easy and timely 
retrieval, when needed (e.g., audit or inspection) and, wh enever feasible, to allow 
any subsequent review of da ta in conjunction with assessment of the facility, 
supporting systems, and staff.  Upon co mpletion of study analysis, research 
information is stored in Dartmouth Colle ge Records Management off-site storage 
located at [ADDRESS_282168] 
protected database (or its equivalent) indefinitely. 
 
7.0 STUDY MONITORING, AUDI TING, AND INSPECTING  
 
7.1 Safety and Data Monitoring 
 
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_65063] (DSMAC) of the Norris Cotton Cancer Center.  The Committee meets 
quarterly to review accrual rates and info rmation of all studies that have accrued 
participants.  The DSMAC has the authority  to suspend or terminate all research 
activities that fall with in its jurisdiction.  In the event that a study is suspended or 
terminated by [CONTACT_233781], that informa tion will be forwar ded to the CPHS 
office.   
 
7.[ADDRESS_282169]  provide support at 
all times for these activities. 
 7.3 Auditing and Inspecting  
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential 
inspection by [CONTACT_233782]. The investigator will permit study-
Presurgical letrozole  19 
 
related audits and inspections by [CONTACT_233783], government regulatory 
bodies, and Dartmouth compliance and quality assurance groups of all study 
related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection 
instruments, study data etc. ) The investigator will ensure the capability for 
inspections of applicable study-relate d facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic 
laboratory, etc.) 
 
 8.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
 
 
Patients on Arm B will be instructed to repor t the occurrence of any adverse event (this 
will not apply to participants on Arm A). An adverse event is any undesirable event 
associated with the administration of letrozol e. Adverse events will be graded according 
to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Versi on 4.0.  A copy of the CTC version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.info.nih.gov).  All appropriate 
treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTC version 4.0. 
 This trial will be independently monitored by [CONTACT_233784].  
 The following definitions will be used to assess causality: No: The clinical adverse event is definitely unrelated to the study 
medications (e.g., does not follow  a reasonable temporal sequence 
from study medication administration, present prior to receiving study 
medication, etc.) 
Unlikely: The study medications do not ha ve any reasonable association with the 
observed experience; however, rela tionship cannot be definitely 
excluded. 
Possibly: The connection with study medi cation administration appears feasible, 
but cannot be excluded  with certainty (e.g.,  follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from medication administration, but may also be 
related to other known factors). 
Probably: The clinical expe rience appears relate d to the study me dications with a 
high degree of certainty (e.g., follows  a reasonable temporal sequence 
from medication administration and abates upon discontinuation of the 
medication, cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_233785]’s clinical state or ot her modes of therapy administered to 
the patient, etc.) 
  
9.0. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
9.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT – The pr imary endpoint of this trial is the level of IRS-
1/PI3K/AKT pathway activation in prim ary tumors, measured by [CONTACT_233786] (IRS-1, 
phospho-IRS-1-Ser636/639, phospho-AKT-T308, phospho-AKT-S473). 
9.2  SECONDARY ENDPOINT – The seconda ry endpoint is Ki67 score, as 
determined by [CONTACT_233787]67+ tumor cells by [CONTACT_4658].

alter IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway activat ion in breast tumors. RAD001-induced 
pathway activation will be defined as a ≥50% increase in phospho-AKT 
densitometric signal value compared to DMSO-treated control; this scoring 
system provides a binary metric for sample  size determination for Arm B (below). 
Given that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we do not know what fraction of ER+/HER2- 
breast tumors will exhibit RAD001-induced  IRS-1/PI3K/AKT activation. Hence, 
tumors from 10 untreated patients in Arm A will be used to determine the 
frequency with which RAD001 induces AKT activation. 
The fraction of tumors in Arm A (unt reated patients) th at exhibit RAD001-
induced AKT activation will be used to determine the number of patients that 
need to be enrolled in Arm B (presurgical Letrozole treatment) to detect a significant effect of presurgical Letr ozole treatment on RAD001-induced AKT 
activation. We estimate that ≤15% of Letrozole-treated tumors will exhibit 
RAD001-induced AKT activation. If we  observe that RAD001 increases 
phospho-AKT in _X_ of 10 tumors in Arm A, we will enroll _Y_ patients in Arm 
B (presurgical Letrozole) to provide a su fficient number of tumors to detect a 
significant effect ( p≤0.05) of presurgical Letrozol e on RAD001-induced changes 
in phospho-AKT levels with 80% power (calculated using uncorrected chi-
squared statistic). If we observe that ≤3 tumors from untreated patients in Arm A 
exhibit RAD001-induced AKT activation, th e study will be terminated at this 
point, and Arm B will not enroll patients. To account for interpatient/intertumor 
variability, we will enroll a minimum of [ADDRESS_282172] patient population X 
(n of tumors  from untreated patients that exhibit 
a ≥50% increase in P-AKT levels in response 
to RAD001 treatment ex vivo )  Y

10.[ADDRESS_282173] written and dated approval from the CPHS of 
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center fo r the trial protocol, amendment(s), 
written informed consent form, consen t form updates, subject recruitment 
procedures (e.g., advertisements) and writ ten information to be provided to 
subjects.  The investigator s, or a person designated by [CONTACT_473], will 
explain the benefits and risks of particip ation in the study to each subject (and  
impartial witness when applicable) and obt ain written informed consent prior to 
the subject entering the study (before initiation of non-routine tests and 
administration of study drug).  The final fo rm must be agreed to by [CONTACT_233790]-Hitchcock Medical Center and must contain all elements in the sample form, in language readily understood by [CONTACT_3433] e subject.  Each subject’s original 
consent form, signed and dated by [CONTACT_233791], will be re tained by [CONTACT_093].  In addition, 
a copy of the signed informed consen t will be given to the subject. 
 
10.3  Potential Risks and Benefits 
The physical risk of study participation is low. Subj ects in Arm A are receiving 
no study-related treatment. Subjects in  Arm B are receiving 10-21 days of 
treatment with 2.5 mg/day Letrozole prior to  surgery; adjuvant therapy with this 
drug and dose are standard-of-care fo r this patient population, and will be 
administered for up to 5 years after surger y. The results of this  investigation may 
provide novel information on ER and PI 3K/mTOR signaling pathways in breast 
cancer, which may shape the development of future treatment regimens to benefit 
future patients with breast cancer. Loss of patient confidentiality is a risk of participation.  Participation in this study is of low overall risk and has no potential 
for direct clinical benefit.  
10.4  Confidentiality 
The pathology specimens from the patient biopsies will be la beled only with the 
patient case number.  The key matching pati ent identification with the patient case 
number will be kept in a locked drawer in the PI’s office.  Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_233764].  No one will have access to the study records but for the I nvestigators and CRA’s, the Dartmouth-
Hitchcock CPHS, the FDA, and OPRR.

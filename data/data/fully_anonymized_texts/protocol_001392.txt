 BACKGROUND AND STUDY  RATIONALE  
 
This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable University of Pennsylvania Research Policies 
and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations including [as applicable include 
the following regulations as they apply 45 CFR 46 , 21 CFR Parts 50 , 54, 56, 312, 314 and 812 and Good 
Clinical Practice : Cons olidated Guideline s approved by [CONTACT_5787] 
(ICH). Note:Only include ICH compliance if the study will actually comply with these requirements.]  All 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478].  
Introduction  
Lidocaine is used widely in the field of dermatology for  anesthetizing the skin.  It is used commonly for 
minor procedures such as  punch biopsies, and more complex outpatient facial reconstruction  after skin 
cancer removal . Patients consistently experience  discomfort from lidocaine injection s, particularly since 
procedures on highly sensitive areas such as the nose and lips are common . Vibrating kinetic anesthesia 
devices have  shown efficacy in reducing the pain of lidocaine injections in dentistry, pediatr ics, and 
dermatology, however no  studies exist investigating the effect of these devices on the pain of lidocaine 
injections on the face.  
 
The proposed study is a split -body randomized controlled trial of kinetic anesthesia devices on pain of  
lidocaine in jection measured by a visual analog scale  (VAS) . Study participants will be healthy  adult  
volunteers  recruited from students, faculty, staff, and others  healthy adult  within the University of 
Pennsylvania. The study  intervention will be application of the Blaine Labs Vibration Anesthesia Device at 
the time of injection,  according to the manufacturer ’s instructions. Participants will rate the pain from one 
injection with the  kinetic anesthesia device  (KAD)  in use, and one injection without the KAD. Ratings will  
occur on a VAS. Participants will be asked whether they preferred the injection with or  without the KAD. 
Injections will occur at these three sites: lateral forehead,  nasofacial  sulcus, and lateral b ack. Participants 
will be randomized to one of three locations, and to the  order of intervention (i.e. first or second injection  
with KAD ). Injections with and without the intervention will  occur on the right and left side of the body 
respectively.  
1.[ADDRESS_1147218] been proposed and include slow 
rate of injection, with warmed, buffered  lidocaine to decrease discomfort of local anesthetic injection  
(Kuboa) , Vibrating  devices have been shown to reduce the pain of local botul inum toxin  injections,  steroid 
injections for keloid  treatment  , local anesthetic injections in eyelid surgery , and in venipuncture in a 
pediatric emergency department . It is thought that vibration decreases the pain of injection by [CONTACT_826924], first proposed by [CONTACT_341844], which asserts that the vibrating neural input  
overrides painful signals and prevents them from reaching the central nervous system. No study has yet 
investigated vibration devices for lidocaine inj ection at multiple body sites in the  dermatologic surgery 
setting. The VAS is reported to be the most frequently used assessment instrument to evaluate the 
analgesic  effects of various therapi[INVESTIGATOR_826913]. It has been systematicall y 
evaluated by  [CONTACT_826925], who determined that a change of 10mm or more on this scale represents a real 
clinical  change in acute pain.

1.2.[ADDRESS_1147220] of KAD on the pain of lidocaine  
injection in healthy adult volunteers at sites with clinical relevance in dermatologic surgery. Primary  
Objectives: To determine the effect of KAD versus no device on pain of local anesthetic  
injection measured by [CONTACT_826927]: 1. To determine if the effect of KAD on pain of local anesthetic injection is 
associated with anatomic location of the injection ;  2. To determine subject  preference of KAD versus no 
device for local anest hetic injection ; 3. To gather  qualitative data on changes to the subjects’  experience of 
pain and overall experience using the KAD versus  no device.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1147221] of KAD versus no device on pain of lidocaine injection, participants  
will be asked to evaluate each injection on a 100mm visual analog scale (VAS). Ratings will be  
quantified at intervals of 1mm from 1mm to 100mm, with 1 mm representing "no pain at all" and 100  
mm representing "worst pain imaginable." VAS ratings from injections with and without the device will be 
compared in each patient.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives (if applicable)  
To determine if the effect of KAD on pain of local anesthetic injection is associated wi th 
anatomic location of the injection, VAS ratings will be used within a statistical model. To determine  
subject  preference of kinetic device versus no device for local anesthetic injection, participants  will be 
asked  after the completion of their  second injection: "Which method of injection did you prefer  overall?" 
with the following answers: "With the vibrating kinetic anesthesia device being used"  
"without the vibrating kinetic anesthesia device" and "no preference" To gather qualitative data on  
changes to the subjects’  experience of pain and overall experience using KAD versus no device, patients 
will be asked the following questions: "Do you have any comments on how  the KAD affected your

 injection experience?" "Were you bothered in any way by [CONTACT_826928]   [check yes or no] if so please 
comment" . 
3 Investigational Plan  
3.1 General Design  
The study will be an open label split -body crossover trial, using healthy adult volunteers recruited from the  
faculty, staff and student body of the University of Pennsylvania , and from the University City area of 
Philadelphia . Participants will be randomi zed to one  of three anatomic sites deemed relevant: the 
nasofacial  sulcus, the lateral forehead, and the upper  back.  Participants will then be randomized to 
receive injection with the KAD first or  second. The injection will be 0.5 cc of room temperature bu ffered 
lidocaine injected at constant slow  speed (approximately 5 seconds) through a [ADDRESS_1147222] of practice.  When the KAD is used it will be used as  directed: firmly 
pressed on the skin adjacent to the injection, with the needle aimed into the lighted  area. Volunteers will 
evaluate each injection immediately after it is complete using the visual analog  scale. When both 
injections are completed, participants will indicate their preference of injection,  complete qualitative 
questions, and note necessary demographic information. Injection location and  order of intervention (i.e. 
first or second) will be noted.  
3.1.[ADDRESS_1147223] in an examination room in the Dermatologic Surgery clinic at the Perelman  
Center for Advanced Medicine.  
2. The KAD used will be the Blaine Labs Vibration  Anesthesia Device. The device will be purchased from 
Blaine Labs directly.  
3. Injections will be made up of 0.5mL of room temperature 1% lido caine buffered with 8.4% sodium 
bicarbonate, procured from the  dermatologic surgery clinic. Injections will use th e standard syringe with 30 
gauge  needle.  
4. Before any procedure is done or information is collected for the study, subjects  will be asked to read  and 
sign the consent form. Adequate time will be given for subjects to review the Informed Consent Docum ent 
and review any of their questions or concerns with the study staff or Principal Investigator.  
5. Baseline vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure) will be obtained prior to the first injection.  
6. Then each subject will be randomized to one location: nasofacial  sulcus,  lateral forehead or lateral back.  
7. Each subject will be randomized to receive the intervention with  KAD either first or second.  
8. The first injection will always be on the left side and  the second will always be on the right  
9. When the KAD is used for the injection, it  will be held by [CONTACT_826929] h and. 
It will be firmly pressed on the skin,  turned on, adjacent to the injection [ADDRESS_1147224]. Sobanko,  with verbal cues standardized.  
11. After each injection, study participants will be asked to document  their level of acute pain using the  
VAS. A paper and pen version of the scale will be used . 
12. After both injections are complete, safety vitals will again be obtained (heart rate, blood pressure) in 
order to assess whether subject has tolerated the injection without any adverse reactions. If necessary , 
repeat vitals will be obtained until the P rincipal Investigator feels the subject is medically clear to leave.  
[ADDRESS_1147225] has 
additional questions or concerns regarding their participation or study -related procedures,  participants will 
be compensated and will be free to go at this point.  
16. The kinetic anesthesia device will be cleaned with  an alcohol swab. Study personnel will wash hands 
and repeat the exercise on the next participant.  
3.1.3  Allocation to Interventional Group  
Participants will be randomized to one of three locations: nasofacial  sulcus, lateral forehead, or upper  back. 
Additionally, subjects  will be randomized to receive the intervention with vibration anesthesia device on 
their first (left) or second (right) -sided injection. This is a split body study so each participant will receive 2 
total injections – one with and one without the interven tion. Randomization will be achieved by [CONTACT_826930] a sealed envelope by [CONTACT_241264], that will have a location and an order listed. This will 
randomize subjects and will ensu re that groups can be balanced, by [CONTACT_826931].  
3.2  Study Endpoints  
3.2.1  Primary Study Endpoints  
Each injection will be evaluated by 100mm visual analog scale (VAS) for acute pain immediately after  
the injection is complete. Patients visually indicate by [CONTACT_826932] a [ADDRESS_1147226] been  completed. They will be asked age, sex, and role at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Because pain is  characterized as quantitative AND qualitative, there will be  a free response section for 
comments,  specifically asking “Do you have any comments on how the kinetic anesthesia device affected 
your injection experience? ” A second qualitative entry section will ask: “Were you bothered in any way by 
[CONTACT_826933] [check yes or no] if so please comment ”

 9 Safety and Adverse Events  
9.1 Definitions  
9.1.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be a dverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_241890]:  
 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans 
whether or not considered drug related.  
 
In this study, the most likely event would be an adverse reaction to lidocaine. In this specific setting, using 
this dosage of lidocaine the most likely reaction will occur at the local injection site. A systemic reaction 
would be exceedingly unlikely.  
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836] 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical signific ance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bro nchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .  
 
For additional information on definitions and clarificatio ns which may be helpful in creating the safety 
monitoring portion refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_1147239], the investigator will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be 
recorded  in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.

 All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event will 
be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determi ned that the study intervention or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study 
period and is considered to be possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will be 
recorded and reported immediately.  
9.3 Relationship of AE to Study  
9.4 Reporting of Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Problems  
Investigator s and the protocol sponsor  (which may or may not be a Penn Investigator)  must conform to the 
adverse event reporting timelines, formats and requirements of the various entities to which they are 
responsible,  
 
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the 
initial report includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Current status  
• Whether study intervention was discontinued  
• The reason why the eve nt is classified as serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study intervention  
 
 
Additionally all  other events (unanticipated  problems, adverse reactions, unanticipated adverse device 
effects and subject complaints  will be recorded and reported with respect to institutional and federal policies 
as described in the Penn Manual  and below.  
9.4.1  Follow -up report  
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes the 
investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant new or reassess ed 
information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted to the IRB. The investigator 
is responsible for ensuring that all SAE are followed until either resolved or stable.  
9.4.2  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Data and safety monitori ng will be performed by [CONTACT_458].  Monitoring will be conducted per 
the Lidocaine drug label: “Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (adequacy of 
ventilation) vital signs and the patients state of consciousness should be accomplished after each local 
anesthetic injection. ” For additional safety precautions, vitals will be also be obtained prior to subject 
receiving their first injection. Vitals will include heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_98157]. Assessment of 
the participants adequacy of ventilation will also be carried out prior to and after the lidocaine injections.  
 
[ADDRESS_1147240] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
[ADDRESS_1147241] vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
10.[ADDRESS_1147242] will be assigned a random study ID number, and a key will be used to link this number to their 
identifiable information. This link will be used only to track adverse events if they occur.  
Study data, i.e. visual analog scale ratings, preferences, and demographic information will not be connected 
with names, birth dates, or MRNs at any time. Data will be collected in this manner on paper and will be 
immediately encoded in a secure com puter database, and the paper records will be kept securely until after 
the closure of the study with the IRB.  
Electronic identifiable information will be stored on the Penn Medicine server and that any paper documents 
with identifiers (such as consent fo rms) will be stored in a secu re location under lock and key.  
Data will be kept on password -protected computers.

11 Ethical Considerations  
11.1 Risks  
The main risk of this study is the (expected) discomfort  of lidocaine injection in the face and back.  
Lidoc aine is a well -studied and well -tolerated drug. The risks of injecting this dose  of lidocaine  
(0.5mL, 1%) are exceedingly low.  The most likely reaction to this dose will be at the site of the injection.  
Inadvertent intravenous injection is theoretically possible but has not happened in over hundreds of 
thousands of injections in our clinic while properly anesthetizing skin for c ancer removal since 2005.   
Furthermore,  the concentrations and volume injected has an infinitesimal risk of inducing systemic side 
effects.  Adverse reactions to lidocaine will be treated according to standard of care.  Study personne l are 
also w ell trained in diagn osing side effects of lidocaine toxicity. There  will be no epi[INVESTIGATOR_826918] (a common additive to lidocaine) - this lowers the chances of  an adverse reaction. There are no 
known risks from application of a KAD at the peri -injection  site. Covino BG: Pharmacology of local 
anesthetic agents. Br J Anaesth. 58:701 -716 1986  Walsh A, Walsh S: Local anesthesia and the 
dermatologist. Clin Exp Dermatol. 36(4):[ADDRESS_1147243] painful part of minor  dermatological 
procedures. A reduction in the pain of injections by [CONTACT_826940], and  possi bly patients in 
outpatient surgical  settings. Furthermore, if successful this study would provide  evidence based 
guidelines for the proper use of these medical devices in multiple locations on the body.  
11.3 Risk Benefit Assessment  
We anticipate that the potential benefits and knowledge to be gained by [CONTACT_826941]:  Individuals have 
volunteered to participate and given informed consent to enter the study. They face minimal risk. There are 
no direct benefits for participation in the study. The knowledge gained will benefit those receiving similar 
injections in the future.  
11.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
Informed consent will be obtained in writing  at the time of the investigative procedure, by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_826919]. Prospective participants, after responding to a recruitment email, will receive a full  
description of the study procedure, risks and benefits. They will then be able to decide whether they  
wish to participate in the study. If they choose to participate, subjects will be informed again on the day  
of the study, and written consent will be obtained at that time. The language used will be targeted for a  
layman's understanding . This should be well -understood by [CONTACT_826942]. It is not anticipated that subjects incapable of consent or those requiring legally authorized  
representatives will enroll in the study. Participants will be allowed to withdraw from the study at any  
time by a verbal refusal to proceed .  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1147244] Stipends or Payments  
For their time and effort of being in a trial, subjects will be compensated $25.[ADDRESS_1147245] 
at the end of their completed visit.

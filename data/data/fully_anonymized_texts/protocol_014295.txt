3.0 INTRODUCTION  
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) is based on Protocol HS -15-549, Amendment 4: 5.0, [ADDRESS_451065] 2016. 
The purpose of this document is to provide details and clarifications on study populations and on how the 
variables will be derived, how missing data will be handled, as well as details on statistical method ologie s 
to be used to analyze the pharmacokinetics ( PK), safety and efficacy data from the study.   
 
The document may evolve over time, for example, to reflect the requirements of protocol amendments or 
regulatory requests.  However, the final SAP must be finalized, approved by [CONTACT_1034], and placed on  
file before database is locked .  Deviations from the final approved plan will be noted in the clinical study 
report.  
 
4.0 STUDY DESCRIPTION  
4.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the steady state PK of buprenorphine (BPN) and norbuprenorphine (norBPN) 
following repeated subcutaneous (SC) administration of CAM2038 q1w (50 mg/mL) at 4 different injection sites in adult opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- dependent subjects with chronic pain. 
• To evaluate steady state PK of BPN and norBPN following repeated SC administration of CAM2038 q4w (356 mg/mL) with the buttock as the injection site in adult opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -dependent 
subjects with  chronic pain. 
The secondary objective of the study is: 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w in adult opi[INVESTIGATOR_362051]. 
• To assess relative bioavailability of B PN at steady state following repeated  SC administration of 
[ADDRESS_451066] s with chroni c pain 
The exploratory objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate maintenance o f treatment efficacy when transferring adult opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -dependent subjects 
from Sublingual (SL) BPN to CAM2038 q1w and q4w, as determined by [CONTACT_252255]. 
• To evaluate subject -rated worst daily pain and average daily pain, using an 11-point numerical 
rating  scale (NRS), following repeated SC administration of CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w 
in adult opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent subjects. 
4.2 STUDY TREATMENTS  
Within 21 days of a medical Screening visit and confirmation of eligibility, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treat ment groups (refer to Section 10.2  of the clinical study protocol , Eligibility Review and 
Randomization, for more detail.  Please also note that Group 3 was not randomized.):

buttock to reach steady state, rotating between right and left buttock sites, followed by 4 single 
BRAEBURN PHARMACEUTICALS  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 1.00—16 December, 2016  
HS-15-549 SAP  Page 7 of 18  weekly SC injections of 32 mg CAM2038 q1w administered in the buttock (reference), abdomen, 
thigh, and back of upper arm in a randomized, crossove r manner, with injection site sequence 
allocated using a randomized crossover design.  
• Group 2: 4 monthly SC injections of 128 mg CAM2038 q4w (356 mg/mL) administered in the buttock, rotating between right and left buttock injection sites.  
• Group 3: 7 daily doses of 24 mg of SL BPN followed by 4 monthly SC injections of 160 mg CAM2038 q4w (356 mg/mL) administered in the buttock, rotating between right and left buttock injection sites.  
4.3 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a Phase II, open -label, partially randomized, 3- treatment group, multi -site study designed to 
evaluate the steady state PK of BPN and norBPN following repeated SC administration of CAM2038 
q1w (Group 1) at different injection sites and to evaluate the steady state PK of BPN and norBPN after 
repeated SC admin istration of CAM2038 q4w (Groups 2 and 3 ) in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- dependent subjects with a 
history of chronic non- cancer pain. The study will involve 4 phases: Screening, Treatment, open label 
safety extension and Follow-up.   
 Within 21 days of a medical Screening visit and confirmation of eligibility, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (refer to Section 10.2 of the clinical study protocol , Eligibility Review and 
Randomization, for more detail):  
• Group 1: 3 single weekly SC injections of 32 mg CAM2038 q1w (50 mg/mL) administered in the buttock to reach steady state, rotating between right and left buttock sites, followed by 4 single 
weekly SC injections of 32 mg CAM2038 q1w administered in the buttock (reference), abdomen, 
thigh, and back of upper ar m in a randomized, crossover manner, with injection site sequence 
allocated using a randomized crossover design.  
• Group 2: 4 monthly SC injections of 128 mg CAM2038 q4w (356 mg/mL) administered in the buttock, rotating between right and left buttock injecti on sites.  
• Group 3: 7 daily doses of 24 mg of SL BPN followed by 4 monthly SC injections of 160 mg 
CAM2038 q4w (356 mg/mL) administered in the buttock, rotating between right and left buttock 
injection sites.  
For subjects in Group 1, the first 3 SC injections of CAM2038 q1w will be administered in the buttock, 
rotating between right and left buttock on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 in order to achieve steady state PK of 
BPN and norBPN. Subjects will be administered each CAM2038 q1w injection at the clinical resea rch 
unit (CRU) on an outpatient basis. Following the first administration, subjects will attend an interim visit 
on Day 2 to evaluate safety and tolerability of the transition from 24 mg SL BPN (Suboxone or 
equivalent) to CAM2038 q1w. To evaluate steady state PK of BPN and norBPN following CAM2038 
q1w administration at various sites, CAM2038 q1w will be administered at 4 different injection sites, i.e., buttock (reference), abdomen, thigh and back of upper arm, on Day 22, Day 29, Day [ADDRESS_451067]- dose. At the 
Day 50 (EOT) visit, subjects may continue on with open-l abel extension phase for up to [ADDRESS_451068] daily pain and average dai ly pain 
using an 11-point NRS on an electronic device. 
 
BRAEBURN PHARMACEUTICALS  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 1.00—[ADDRESS_451069] -dose on an outpatient basis to determine achievement of 
steady state. To characterize steady state PK of BPN and norBPN, subjects will be confined to the CRU and serial PK samples will be collected for up to 24 hours following the fourth dose, administered on Day 85; subsequent PK samples will be collected up to 28 days’ post -dose on an outpatient basis. At each 
study visit, safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted at pre- specified times. At the Day 113 
(EOT) visit, CAM2038 q4w [ADDRESS_451070] daily pain and average daily pain using an11-point NRS on an electronic device. 
 For su bjects in Group 3 (160 mg CAM2038 q4w) , repeated  daily doses of [ADDRESS_451071] -
dose on an outpatient basis. At the Day 127 (EOT) visit, subjects will be transitioned back to standard  
care. At each study visit, safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted at pre- specified times. 
Subjects will also be required to record their worst daily pain and average daily pain using an 11-point 
NRS on an electronic device.   
For all Groups, fo llow-up call will be conducted approximately [ADDRESS_451072] study visit of the 
Treatment Phase or open label safety extension phase.  
4.4 RANDOMIZATION AND BL INDING  
Up to a total of 40 subjects will be randomized at a 3:2 ratio to Group 1 (CAM2038 q1w) o r Group 2 
(CAM2038 q4w).  Per Protocol Amendment  05, up to additional [ADDRESS_451073] 20 subjects, and up to 24 subjects, will be randomized to Group 1 and assigned to 1 of the 
following 4 injection site sequences  at a 1:1:1:1 ratio : ABDC, BCAD, CDBA, and DACB, where 
A=buttock (reference), B=abdomen, C=thigh, and D=back of upper arm. For Group 2 (CAM2038 q4w), 
approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled.

Prior and Concomitant medication will be summarized for the safety population.  
9.0 EFFI CACY ANALYSES  
The primary objective of the study is to assess PK profile.  The efficacy evaluation is for exploratory 
purpose  only.   
9.1 NUMERICAL RATING SCA LE (NRS) FOR PAIN  
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for p ain will be used to assess the worst daily and average daily pain.  The 
NRS is an 11- point scale with anchors 0 (no pain) and 10 (worst pain imaginable). Subjects will record 
their Worst and Average Pain Score over the past [ADDRESS_451080] daily pain ( AWDP)  at a visit  will be defined as the average of the non -missing 
worst daily pain score  since previous visit; the average of the average daily pain ( AADP) at a visit will be 
defined as the average of the non -missing average daily pain score since previous visit .   
 Changes from baseline in AWDP  will be defined as Baseline AWDP  – Post-baseline AWDP .  A positive 
change is indicative of improvement.  Similarly,  changes from baseline in AADP  will be defined as 
Baseline AADP  – Pos t-baseline AADP .  A positive change is indicative of improvement.  
 
Changes from baseline in AADP  and in AADP  will be summarized over post- baseline visits by [CONTACT_362057].  
 AADP and in AADP will be summarized over p ost-baseline visits by [CONTACT_1570]. 
9.2 URINE TOXICOLOGY  
The urine toxicology for opi[INVESTIGATOR_362052], and other non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_362053].   Frequency and incidence of positive urine toxicology results will be su mmarized 
by [CONTACT_1570].   
9.3 INTERIM ANALYSES  
No interim analysi s will be performed .  Data for all subjects from Groups 1 and 2 who either co mpleted 
or discontinued prematurely from this open label study will be cleaned and locked .  The data will then be 
analyzed  according to the SAP and the results may be presented in a preliminary report.  Regardless of 
the analysis results, no additional subjects will be enrolled into Groups 1 and 2.   
 
Data from subjects in Group 3 will continue to be cumulated after data from subjects in Groups 1 and 2 
are locked.  After all subjects in Group 3 are either completed or discontinued prematurely from this open 
label study, these d ata will be cleaned and locked.   The final analyses from all data from Groups 1, 2, and 
3 will be performed according to the SAP after Group 3 data are locked.  The formal results of the study 
will be presented in the CSR. 
9.4 ADJUSTMENT S FOR MULTIPLICITY  
As the efficacy evaluation is for exploratory purpose only, no adjustment for multiple testings will 
be made.     
BRAEBURN PHARMACEUTICALS  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 1.00—[ADDRESS_451081] 20 subjects, but no more than 24 subjects, will be enrolled to Group 1 (CAM2038 q1w). 
Approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled to each of Group 2 (128 mg CAM2038 q4w) and  Group 3 
(160 mg CAM2038 q4w), for a total of approximately 32 subjects administered  CAM2038 q4w.. These 
sample sizes are consistent with typi[INVESTIGATOR_362054]. Replacement subjects may be added at the discretion 
of the Sponsor with the agreement of the Principal Investigator. 
 
10.0 SUMMARIES OF PHARMACOKINETIC  ANALYSI S 
10.1 PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS  
PK parameters of BPN and its active metabolite norBPN will be estimated using Phoenix® WinNonlin® 
(Certara, L.P., 100 Overlook Center, Princeton, NJ [ZIP_CODE] [LOCATION_003]), version 6.4 or higher. Standar d non-
compartmental methods and actual dates and times of dosing and blood sampling will be used in the calculations. The following PK parameters will be determined for BPN and norBPN (if applicable): 
Group 1:  
o AUC
ss (area under the plasma concentration -time curve during a 7-day dosing interval at 
steady state) for each injection site, i.e., buttock (reference), abdomen, thigh and back of 
upper arm  
o Average plasma concentration during a dosing interval at steady state ( Css,av) for each 
injection site, i.e., buttock (reference), abdomen, thigh and back of upper arm  
o Maximum observed plasma concentration during a dosing interval at steady state ( Css,max) 
for each injection site, i.e., buttock (reference), abdomen, thigh and back of upper arm  
o Time to C ss,max (tss,max) for each injection site, i.e., buttock (reference), abdomen, thigh and 
back of upper arm.  
o Trough concentration C ss,trough  measured prior to the next actual dose or next scheduled 
hypothetical dose at steady state .  
o norBPN/BPN ratios for AUC ss and C ss,max for each injection site, i.e., buttock  
(reference), abdomen, thigh and back of upper arm . 
Group 2: 
o AUC ss (AUC during a 28- day dosing interval at steady state)  
o Css,av  
o Css,max  
o tss,max  
o Css,trough  
o %Fluctuation  
o norBPN/BPN ratios for AUC ss and C ss,ma x 
 
Group 3: 
o AUC ss (AUC during a 24-hour (SL BPN) and 28-day (CAM2038 q4w) dosing interval at 
steady state)  
o Css,av  
o Css,max  
o tss,max  
o Css,trough  
o %Fluctuation  
o norBPN/BPN ratios for AUC ss and C ss,max 
 
BRAEBURN PHARMACEUTICALS  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 1.00—16 December, 2016  
HS-15-549 SAP  Page 13 of 18  AUC ss will be cal culat ed using the linear trapezoidal meth od up to C ss, max  and the logarithmic trapezoidal 
method for the remainder of the curve up to 168 hours after dose for CAM2038 q1w, 672 hours after dose 
for CAM2038 q4w and 24 hours after dose for SL BPN. 
 
Css,av will be calculated as AUC ss/τ, where τ  is the dosing interval (168 hours for CAM2038 q1w,  672 
hours for CAM2038 q4w and 24 hours for SL BPN. 
 
%Fluctuation will be calculated as (C ss,max – C ss,min)*100/C ss,av for CAM2038 q4w and SL BPN, where 
Css,min is the minimum plasma concentration during a dos age interval at steady state (4th dose for 
CAM2038 q4w and 7th dose for SL BPN).    
 
The norBPN/BPN ratios for AUC ss and C ss,max will be  adjusted for differences in molecular weight 
betwee n buprenorphine (molecular weight 467.64 g/mol) and norbuprenorphine (molecular weight 413.55 
g/mol).  
 Plasma concentration levels of BPN and norBPN assessed prior to  next actual or  hypothetical dose 
(C
trough) will be assessed after Dose [ADDRESS_451082] party Clinical Research Organization (CRO), 
Worldwide Clinical Trials.  PK results will be produced by [CONTACT_166181] a separated report.  T he PK results 
will also be discussed in the Clinical Study Report (CSR) by [CONTACT_362058].  
10.2 HANDLING OF VAL UES BELOW THE LLOQ  
Plasma concentration values below the limit of quantification ( LLOQ ) will be assigned a value of zero 
when they preceed precede  the first quantifi able sample. V alues below LLOQ embedded between two 
quantifiable data points or occuring after the last quantifiable concentration will be treated as missing 
data.  
10.3 ANALYSIS OF PHARMACO KINETICS  
Summaries of plasma concentrations of BPN and norBPN will be presented for the PK EVAL  population 
and PK population by [CONTACT_362059], if applicable. The following descriptive statistics will be 
presented at each nominal time point: n, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and coeffi cient of variation 
percentage (CV%), median, geometric mean, geometric CV%, minimum and maximum values. Mean plasma concentration -time data will be displayed for the PK EVAL  population and the PK population in 
linear and semi -logarithmic scales by [CONTACT_362060], if applicable. Individual plasma 
concentrations of BPN and norBPN will be listed for the PK population by [CONTACT_19313]. 
 
The PK parameters (Section 10. 1) will be listed for the PK population and summarized for the PK EVAL 
population and PK populat ion by [CONTACT_362059], if applicable . Summary statistics will include n,

For Group 1 (CAM2038 50 mg/mL q1w), the following consideration s will apply in the PK analyses. The 
primary PK parameters will be AUC ss and C ss,max after steady state injections of CAM2038 q1w at 
different injection sites. The injection site buttock will be the reference. The analyses will be based on 
log-transformed data. The natural log -transformed AUC ss and C ss,max data will be analyzed using an 
ANOVA model, sequence, subject within sequence (1, 2, 3, 4 corresponding to A/B/D/C, B/C/A/D, 
C/D/B/A, D/A/C/B, where A=buttock, B=abdomen C=thigh, or D=back of upper arm), period, and

estimated injection  site effects, injection site differences versus the reference (B -A, C-A, and D-A), and 
the 90% confidence intervals of the estimated differences will be presented. The above estimates will be 
expressed on the raw scale (expressed after performing the anti-log).  
 
No interim analysis will be performed.  However, after all Groups 1 and 2 subjects either completed the 
study or discontinued from the study prematurely , the above analysis may be performed before subjects 
from Group 3 complete the study  or discontinued from the study prem aturely .  Before the analysis is 
conducted all data records related to the PK parameters will be locked. Any changes to the records after 
the analysis will be discussed in the CSR.  No additional subjects will  be permitted to enter Group s 1 or 2 
after the analysis is conducted.  
 
For Groups 2 and 3  (CAM2038 q4w), the PK parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086]. 
The primary PK parameters will be AUC ss and C ss,max. Relative bioavailability of BPN will be assessed at 
steady state for 160 mg CAM2038 q4w vs 24 mg SL BPN by [CONTACT_362061] 90% confidence intervals 
tabulated for treatment differences (back tr ansformed and expressed as a percentage).   
 
11.[ADDRESS_451083] ’s physical examination, vital signs, and clinical laboratory results , Injection s ite examination and 
wound c are.  Safety variables will be tabulated and presented by [CONTACT_362062].  
 Because there is no pre-specified  safety outcome defined in terms of AEs , clinically relevant laboratory 
parameters, or vital signs, any formal comparisons between the treatment arms with respect to specific 
safety parameters will be post -hoc. 
11.1 EXTENT OF EXPOSURE  
Summary statistics ( number and percentage) of weeks of exposure to study drug (i.e. from date of  initial 
injection to  the end of the study) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]., 
11.2 COLUMBIA -SUICIDE SEV ERITY RATING SCALE ( C-SSRS)  
Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) w ill be summarized for the Safety Population. 
11.3 COWS AND SOWS  
Clinical Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5390] (COWS)  Scale, and Subjective Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5390] (SOWS) Scale  will be 
summarized over time by [CONTACT_1570]. 
11.4 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Each AE and SAE term recorded on the case report forms (CRFs) by [CONTACT_92869] (SOC) 
and will be mapped to a preferred term using the MedDRA dictionary.  The investigator will assess AE  
severity and relationship to the study treatment. 
 
A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined  as any AE with an onset date on or after date of 
randomization (Groups 1 and 2) or first SL BPN dose (Group 3), or any ongoing event on the date of first 
dose that worsens in severity after date of randomization. Only TEAEs with an onset date prior to dat e of 
last dose + 30 days will be tabulated in summary tables.  For the purpose calculating treatment emergence 
and inclusion in summary tables, incomplete onset dates will be imputed as detailed in Appendix A.

Deaths and SAEs will be summarized similarly to AEs. All adverse event tables will also include the total number of events, counting multiple events per subject. 
 Injection related TEAEs, Other (non- injection  related) TEAEs as well as all TEAEs will be presented by 
[CONTACT_2938]. Summaries of these TEAE subsets will be presented for the following 
categories:  
 
• Study drug related 
• Intensity  
• Relation ship to injection  
• Serious  
• AEs which led to discontinuation  
• SAEs which led to discontinuation  
• TEAEs occurring in 5% or greater of any treatment group (by [CONTACT_11702]) 
 In the AE summary, preferred term s within each SOC will appear in alphabetical order.   
 
Frequencies for deaths and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_362055]. 
 Other safety analyses will be performed as appropriate. 
11.5 LABORATORY ASSESSMENTS  
Chemistry, Hematology, Urinalysis and Coagulation Profile will be assessed over time  (see Section 
10.5.[ADDRESS_451085] of parameters to be assessed) .  Summary statistics 
for these parameters will be presented by [CONTACT_362064] (Hematology, Chemistry, Urinalysis, and Coagulation Profile). Shift tables 
will be presented for shifts from baseline lab  categories to end of study laboratory category.  The three 
laboratory categories will be:  L (below lower bound of norma l range ), N (within normal range), and H 
(above higher  bound of normal range).    
If a lab value is reported using a non- numeric qualifier (e.g., less than (<) a certain value, or greater than 
(>) a certain value), the given numeric value will be used in the summary statistics, ignoring the non -
numeric qualifier. 
BRAEBURN PHARMACEUTICALS  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 1.00—[ADDRESS_451086] of blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mmHg), pulse rate (beats 
per minute), and  respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breaths/min) .  Vital sign  values  and change from baseline in the vital 
signs will be summarized for each treatment group.  
11.[ADDRESS_451087]  will also be 
presented in a listing. 
11.8 12-LEAD ELECTROCARDI OGRAM (ECG)  
12-Lead ECGs will be performed over time . The ECG variables will include ventricular heart rate and the 
PR, QRS, QT, QTcB and QTcF intervals. The ECGs will be signed and dated by a medically -qualified 
individual to confirm review of the ECG and verify whether any abnormalities are clinically signi ficant.  
 
Number and percent of subjects in each ECG finding category (normal, abnormal not clinically 
significant, and abnormal and clinically significant), will be summarized for each visit by [CONTACT_362065]. Summary statistics will be presented for the actual value and actual change for each 
ECG parameter.  
 The number and percent of subjects with QT, QTcB and QTcF intervals < 450 msec, 450 to <480, 480 to <500 and greater than/equal to 500 msec at each visit and overall (at any visit) will be summarized. 
Additionally, the number and percentage of subjects with changes in these parameters of <30 msec, 30 to 
<60 msec and greater than/equal to 60 msec will be summarized at  each visit and overall at the visits 
where ECG is scheduled ). 
 
Bupre norphine plasma concentration vs QT, QTcB and/or QTcF interval relationships will be 
graphicslly graphically  explored. 
11.9 INJECTION  SITE EXAMINATION  
All CAM2038 injection sites (new and old) will be examined during each scheduled visit after the first dose of  CAM2038 for any signs of adverse site reactions, including erythema, pruritus, edema, pain, etc. 
Injection site examination form is included in Appendix 17.3 of the protocol . Subjects will also be 
queried specifically about local tolerability AEs in connection to the examinations.  
AEs that believed to be associated with injection  procedures will be summarized similarly to the 
summaries for other AEs (not associated with injections ).

15.0 APPENDICES  
15.1 APPENDIX A - IMPUTATION ALGORI THM FOR PARTIAL AND 
MISSING DATES  
This section describes missing date imputation methods.  
 
For Adverse Events  
 
If onset date is completely missing, onset date is set to date of randomization.  
If (year is present and month and day are missing) or (year and day are present and month is missing):  
• If year = year of randomization, then set month and day to month and day of randomization 
• If year < year of ran domization, then set month and day to December 31. 
• If year > year of randomization, then set month and day to January 1. 
If month and year are present and day is missing: 
• If year=year of randomization and  
• If month = month of randomization then set day to day of first dose 
• If month < month of first dose then set day to last day of month 
• If month > month of first dose then set day to first day of month 
• If year < year of randomization then set day to last day of month 
• If year > year of randomization then set day to first day of month 
 
For all other cases, set onset date to date of randomization. 
 
• Concomitant Medications /Medical History  
• For start date  
• If start date is completely missing, start date will not be imputed.  
• If (year is present and month and day are missing) or (year and day are present and month 
is missing), set month and day to January 1.  
• If year and month are present and day is missing, set day to 1st day of month. 
 For end date  
• If end date is completely missing, end date will not be imputed.  
• If (y ear is present and month and day are missing) or (year and day are present and month 
is missing), set month and day to December 31.  
• If year and month are present and day is missing, set day to last day of the month.  
 
Note : that if both start and end dates are missing then the medication will be classified as concomitant.

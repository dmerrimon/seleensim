1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
[LOCATION_001] City (NYC)  is home  to 100,000  taxi drivers,  of whom  92% are immigrants.  The 
overwhelming  majority  are men.  This large,  male  taxi driver  population  faces  poor health  
outcomes  that can be mitigated  through  scalable,  targeted  interventions.  NYC taxi drivers  
work  long hours  (10-12 h/d shifts,  ~6d/wk),  most  often  in heavy  traffic.  Exposure  to high 
levels  of particulate  matter  (PM)  and air pollution  are closely  linked  to lung cancer  and 
cardiovascular  disease  (CVD).  
 
DRIIVE  (Data  and Research  on Interventions  to Improve  the Vehicular  Environment)  is a 
community -engaged  translational  pi[INVESTIGATOR_699374]  a two parallel  arm design  to 
obtain  preliminary  data on associations  between  Particulate  Matter  (PM)/air  pollution  and 
physiologic  measurements  and biomarkers  in taxi drivers,  and to determine  the impact  of 
a HEPA  filter (to remove  PM  and volatile  organic  compounds)  intervention  on such  
physiologic  measurements  and biomarkers.  DRIIVE  is funded  by [CONTACT_699424][INVESTIGATOR_699375]   (ECRIP),   which  
trains  physicians  in clinical  research  in [LOCATION_001].  Drivers  will be randomized  to one of two 
groups:  Intervention  or Wait-list Control.  In total, two groups  of 14 participants  in each  
group  will be recruited:  1) Wait List Control  group,  who will receive  a HEPA  filter at the end 
of the 1 month  participation  period  and 2) Intervention  group,  who will receive  a HEPA  
filter two weeks  into their participation  period.  The project  will be completed  within  a 2 year 
timeframe.

3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
There  are approximately  240,000  taxi/limousine  drivers  in the U.S. (1). By  2020,   this 
number  is expected  to increase  by 20% (1). [LOCATION_001] City (NYC)  is home  to 100,000  taxi 
drivers,  among  whom  92% are immigrants  (2, 155).  Forty  percent  of those  are South  
Asian  (originating  from India,  Pakistan,  Bangladesh,  Nepal,  and Sri Lanka)  (2), followed  by 
[CONTACT_699425],  Mexico,  former  USSR,   Haiti,  
Nigeria,  Ethiopia,  Columbia,  Ecuador,  and Jamaica  (2). The overwhelming  majority  of taxi 
drivers  are minority  men.  They  are at great  risk for increased  cancer  risk and poor 
cardiovascular  health  due to a number  of occupation -related  factors,  including  stress,  diet, 
sedentary  lifestyle,  and poor health  care access  (18-21). 
They  work  long hours  (10-12 h/d shifts,  ~6d/wk  (2)), most  often  in heavy  traffic,  and are 
exposed  to environmental  contaminants.  This exposure,  including  to ambient  particulate  
matter  (PM) (even  low-level exposure  to fine airborne  PM [PM smaller  than 2.5 
micrometers  (PM2.5)]), increases  health  risk (13, 22, 23). Even  short -term exposure  (i.e., 
while  driving)  to peak  particle  concentrations  appears  to be linked  with adverse  health  
effects  (24-27). A vehicle  cabin  is a relatively  confined  space  where  drivers  are exposed  to 
high concentrations  of PM. In comparison  to outdoor/indoor  microenvironments,  in-vehicle  
PM levels  are often  very high, originate  from external  sources,  including  road traffic  (28), 
and can be 3-5 times  that of outdoor  PM values  (29). In a study  examining  PM levels  in 
private  cars,  values  in moving  vehicles  exceeded  those  in parked  cars by 9.2 times  for 
PM 10 (PM smaller  than 10 micrometers)  and 3.8 times  for PM 2.5 (28). These  conditions  can 
potentially  be improved  at very low cost,  with a HEPA  filter,  with a resultant  diminution  of 
lung cancer  and cardiovascular  disease  (CVD)  risk in this vulnerable  group  of minority  
men.

The association  between  mortality  with PM 2.5, sulfate  particles,  and sulfur  dioxide  (SO 2) 
was illustrated  in a study  that demonstrated  their role in increasing  all-cause,  
cardiopulmonary,  and lung cancer  mortality  (4, 49). Several  additional  studies  have linked  
PM exposure  to lung cancer  (14, 15, 50). A 26-year prospective  study  found  that each  10 
µg/m3 increase  in PM2.5 exposure  concentration  was associated  with a 15-27% increase  in 
lung cancer  mortality  among  never -smokers  (14). Another  study  found  that each  10 µg/m3 
increase  in PM 2.5 was associated  with an adjusted  increased  risk of all-cause  mortality  of 
14% (95%  CI: 7, 22%),  and with a 37%  (95%CI:  7, 75%)  increase  in lung cancer  mortality  
(15). Many  studies  (although  none  in the U.S. to date)  have  demonstrated  a high 
prevalence  of lung cancer  among  taxi drivers,  suggesting  a possible  association  with PM 
(16, 17). In a large  population -based  study  of Danish  male  drivers,  the odds ratio (OR)  for 
lung  cancer   among   taxi  drivers   was  1.6  (95%   CI  1.2  –  2.2)  after  adjusting   for 
socioeconomic  status  (16). As the duration  of driver  employment   increased,   the  lung 
cancer  risk also increased  significantly:  the highest  risk was found  among  long term taxi 
drivers  with [ADDRESS_949470] employment  (OR 
3.0; 95% CI 1.2 – 6.8) (16). A prospective  study  of drivers  in Geneva  found  that 
professional  drivers,  including  taxi drivers,  had significant  excess  risk compared  to the 
general  population  for all causes  of death  (standardized  mortality  ratio (SMR) 115, 90% CI 
1.07-1.23)  and for all cancers  (SMR  125, 90% CI 1.12-1.40)  (51). Cause -specific  analysis  
showed  significant  excesses  for lung cancer  (SMR  150, 90% CI 1.23-1.81)   (51).  In 
DRIIVE,  we will collect  data on biomarkers  associated  with lung cancer,  including  cytokine  
levels,  changes   in white  blood  cell profiles,  and changes   in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_699380] (52-55). 
The health  effects  of PM are related  to both particle  size and chemical  composition  (56, 
57). Fine particles,  PM 2.5, produced  mostly  by [CONTACT_699426],  can penetrate  more  
deeply  into the airways  than PM 10. Lung  airways  and alveoli  retain  mostly  PM 2.5 rather  
than PM 10; 96% of the effectively  retained  particles  are PM 2.5, of which  5% are ultrafine  
particles  (<0.1  μm) (58, 59). Fine and ultrafine  particles  are also more  likely  than coarse  
particles  to induce  inflammation  and oxidative  damage.  Elemental  and organic  carbon  
together  make  up a significant  fraction  of ambient  particles.  In  particular,   elemental  
carbon,  a pseudo -marker  of traffic  pollution  such  as that caused  by [CONTACT_699427],  has 
been  found  to be significantly  correlated  with cardiopulmonary  morbidity  and mortality,  and 
thus important  to assess  (144,  145).  
 
There  are data showing  that increased  levels  of inflammatory  cytokines  (e.g. TNF-α, 
interleukin -6, interleukin -8) and bronchoalveolar  lavage  fluid are correlated  with lung 
cancer.  The interleukin -1 family  of cytokines,  including  IL1-beta,  is a key pro-inflammatory  
cytokine  which  regulates  the expression  of several  genes  involved  in the inflammatory  
process.  There  is ample  evidence,  moreover,  that PM stimulates  alveolar  macrophages  
and human  bronchial  epi[INVESTIGATOR_699381],  including  IL-6 
and Il-1beta.  
 
There  is a growing  understanding  of the role of epi[INVESTIGATOR_699382],  
especially  respi[INVESTIGATOR_699383].  Exposure  to 
environmental   carcinogens,   including   particulate   air  pollution,   traffic   particles,   cigarette

smoke,  and cadmium,  has been  reported  to alter normal  DNA  methylation  patterns.  
Importantly,  Palmisano  et al. found  that alterations  to p16 and MGMT  methylation  can be 
identified  in 100%  of patients  with squamous  cell lung carcinoma  up to [ADDRESS_949471] large,  prospective  cohort  study  that 
demonstrated  that chronic  exposure  to air pollutants  is independently  related  to 
cardiovascular  mortality  (3). It showed  that elevations  of PM 2.[ADDRESS_949472]  associations  with CVD.  Fine particulate  air pollution  is a risk factor  for CVD 
via mechanisms  that likely  include  altered  cardiovascular  autonomic  function  (associations  
have been  seen  between  elevations  in PM 2.5 and increases  in systolic  blood  pressure  (30) 
and reduced  heart  rate variability  (31-38), inflammation,  and accelerated  atherosclerosis  
(5, 39-41). Short -term exposure  to PM has been  associated  with elevated  proinflammatory  
markers,  including  interleukin  1-beta (IL-1β), interleukin  6  (IL-6),  tumor -necrosis -factor  
alpha  (TNF -α), and high sensitivity  C-reactive  protein  (hs-CRP),  which  may potentially  
mediate  harmful  subclinical  cardiovascular  effects  (30, 42-45). There  is epi[INVESTIGATOR_699384] a strong  predictor  of future  CVD risk (46) and that elevated  hs-CRP  
is highly  associated  with poor cardiovascular  prognosis  (47, 48). DRIIVE  will contribute  to 
the understanding  of the associations  between  these  mechanisms  and increased  CVD 
risk. 
 
Products  of diesel  combustion,  such  as polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons  (PAHs),  are also 
relevant  to drivers  (164,  165).Many  individual  PAHs  are genotoxic  carcinogens  (165).  One 
of the parent  PAHs,  pyrene,  is metabolized  to 1-hydroxypyrene  and excreted  in the urine,  
has been  widely  used  as a biomarker  for PAH exposure,  and has been  shown  to be 
elevated  in studies  including  taxi drivers  (166-168).  Increased  incidences  of cancer  have 
been  associated  with occupational  PAH exposure,  including  lung cancer  (169).  PAHs  may 
also contribute  to the atherosclerotic  process  and inflammation,  increasing  cardiovascular  
disease  risk (170).  
 
Various  reviews  have shown  that 1 hydroxy  pyrene  (1-OHP)  is a biomarker  of exposure  to 
poly-cyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons  from traffic  related  air pollution   (161,  162).  1 hydroxy  
pyrene  is a major  metabolite  of pyrene  and it is used  to estimate  overall  exposure  to PAH.  
Work specifically  on taxi drivers  has shown  that urinary  1 OHP  levels  were  increased  in 
drivers  compared  with non-occupationally  exposed  subjects.   Elevated  1-OHP  levels  were  
also shown  to be associated  with elevated  levels  of pro-inflammatory  cytokines  and were  
negatively  associated  with levels  of antioxidants  in exposed  taxi drivers.  (163).   In DRIIVE  
we look to show  the impact  of use of a HEPA  filter on [ADDRESS_949473] implementation  of filter.

PRELIMINARY STUDIES 
 
Immigrant  Health  and Cancer  Disparities  Service  (IHCD ) 
One of IHCD‘s  long-standing  community  based  participatory  research  programs  (CBPR)  is 
the South   Asian   Health   Initiative   (SAHI),  founded   in 2004.  [CONTACT_699475]  has led  SAHI  in 
several  projects  on cardiovascular  disease  (CVD)  and cancer  risk reduction  (104):  South  
Asians  Engaging  in Hypertension  Awareness  and Treatment , an NIH-funded  RCT of the 
impact  of linguistically  and culturally  appropriate  educational  materials   on hypertension  
(105);  Smokeless   Tobacco  Oral Pathology  Prevention  and Awareness   Network  (STOP  
PAAN)  (103);  and the Health  Camp  Project  (106) . In Gany‘s  ―Drive  By R eadings  ‖ s tudy, 
over 100 taxi drivers  were  followed  through  their tuberculosis  screening  and treatment,  
with the results  impacting  TB policy  in NYC (107).  Additional  taxi driver  initiatives  include:  
STEP  I (Supporting  Taxi Drivers  to Exercise  through  Pedometers),  funded  by [CONTACT_699428][INVESTIGATOR_699385]    (ECRIP),   to 
investigate  the health  knowledge,  attitudes,  and beliefs  of South  Asian  taxi drivers.  Drivers  
described  high work-related  stress,  health  risk, and poor health  care access  (21). STEP  II, 
also funded  by [CONTACT_699429],  was  a randomized  controlled  trial to evaluate   the efficacy  of a 
culturally  responsive  pedometer/motivational  interviewing  exercise  intervention  among  taxi 
drivers   (108).   74  male   South   Asian   taxi  drivers   participated.   15%  of  the  drivers   who 
completed  the study  improved  > 2000  steps  from their baseline  (108).  Step On It! is a 
cancer  and CVD risk reduction  case  management  project  for NYC taxi drivers  at John  F. 
Kennedy  airport,  and a parallel  effort  in San Francisco  in partnership  with the Palo Alto 
Medical  Foundation  Research  Institute  (109).  Airport  holding  lots are places  where  the taxi 
driver  community  can congregate  to eat, talk, play games,  walk/exercise,  and pray.  We 
have been  successful  in engaging  the taxi driver  community  at airport  holding  lots in our 
risk reduction  interventions.  480 taxi driver  participants  at JFK were  enrolled  in Step On It!, 
50% of the taxi drivers  did not have  a primary  care provider  and 51% did not have  health  
insurance  prior to the intervention.  51% more  are now engaged  in ongoing  care.  33% of 
the drivers  were  subsequently  diagnosed  with diabetes  or  hypertension  and prescribed  
medication    (109).    CICHD    facilitated    the   formation    of   the   Taxi   CAB   (Community  
Advisory/Action  Board)  in [ADDRESS_949474]  on health,  as  an important  issue  for 
drivers.   In  Gany   protocol   X12-025,  a  p ilot  s urvey  s tudy  to  as s es s  NYC  taxi  drivers  ‘   
knowledge,  beliefs  and awareness  of health  risks associated  with air pollution  , 100 NYC 
drivers,  including  both yellow  taxi (N=77)  and livery  (N=23)  cab drivers,  were  surveyed.  
Sixty-seven  percent  of respondents  had worked  as drivers  for at least  three  years,  with 
17% having  worked  more  than 15 years.  Drivers  were  evenly  dispersed  in age, with 17% 
between  18 and 30 years  old, 24% between  31 and 40 years  old, 26% between  41 and 50 
years  old and 32% over 50. Eighty -eight  percent  of all drivers  were  foreign -born.  Over  half 
of all surveyed  drivers  (56%)  believed  that they are exposed  to more  air pollution  than 
those  who are not taxi drivers,  while  25% did not believe  as such,  and 19% were  unsure.  
Most drivers  thought  that air pollution  in general  causes  health  problems  (81%),  while  19% 
did not  agree   or were  unsure.  A belief  that air  pollution   causes  health  problems   was 
significantly  associated  (p<0.05)  with drivers   who had at least  10 years   of taxi driving

experience.  Thirty -four percent  of respondents  stated  they were  ―not worried ‖ about  being  
exposed  to air pollution  while  driving,  while  another  40% said they were  ―a little or 
somewhat  worried ‖. Nineteen  percent  reported  that they believed  they had a  health  
problem  attributable  to air pollution  exposure.  In Gany  protocol  X12-021, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_699386] , we measured  levels  of 
in-vehicle  Particulate  Matter  (PM) concentration  in a convenience  sample  of 7 NYC Taxi 
Cabs.  In-vehicle  PM levels  were  measured  through  Personal  DataRams (pDR)  and 
Microaethalometers , which  were  placed  on the passenger  seat or console  area of the 
taxicab  for the full 6-hour shift. Near-roadway  outdoor  air monitoring  of PM and BC 
concentrations  was also conducted  using  aerosol  monitors  . Compared  with previously  
published  results  of personal  exposure  studies  conducted  in NYC (156,  157),  taxicab  PM 
and BC concentrations  were  elevated.  Average  concentrations  of PM per  15-minute  
interval  for all seven  shifts  indicated  large  intra- and inter-car variability.  Per shift average  
PM concentrations  ranged  from 4 µg/m3 to 49 µg/m3 and 1-minute  peak  levels  measured  
up to 452 µg/m3. Black  carbon  levels  were  also elevated,  and reached  over 10 µg/m 3. 
Peak  in-vehicle  PM levels  were  short  and sporadic,  and may have  been  influenced  by 
[CONTACT_699430],  such  as passenger  smoking,  as recalled  by  [CONTACT_699431]. 
Roadside  air monitoring  was conducted  at three  large  taxi passenger  pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-up stands  in 
midtown  Manhattan,  all located  at traffic  hubs and mass  transport  terminals.  Monitoring  
during  morning  and evening  rush hours  revealed  ambient  PM levels  to be near or greater  
than the EPA 24 hour NAAQS  of 35 µg/m3  for PM 2.5. Average  levels  at each  taxi stand  
were  44 µg/m3 (SD ± 32), 58 µg/m3  (SD ± 10), and 76 µg/m3, (SD ± 43) and peak  levels  
were  as high as 434 µg/m3, mirroring  peak  in-vehicle  values.  Levels  of black  carbon  were  
also found  to be high; peak levels  at one taxi stand  were  as high as 12 µg/m 3. Average  
taxi stand  BC and PM levels  were  significantly  higher  than levels  recorded  at the closest  
[LOCATION_001] State  Department  of Environmental  Conservation‘s  air monitoring  site (Division  
Street)  (158).  As a sedentary  occupational  group  with a disproportionate  prevalence  of 
disease,  taxi drivers  are likely  at greater  risk from air pollutant  exposure   than  those  
working  away  from roadways.  Community -engaged  interventions  are needed  to limit their 
exposure  to high levels  of PM and BC. The proposed  DRIIVE  project  will move  the 
preliminary  data a step forward and the CAB will continue  to play a central  role  in 
planning,  implementation,  and dissemination.

traffic -related  pollution.  Ambient  PM exposure  assessment  and several  similar  health  
endpoints  (e.g.,  inflammatory  cytokines  in the blood,  and ECG,  heart  rate, pulmonary

PM exposures.  
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This study  is proposed  to be carried  out across  a two year period  including  an intervention  
period  and dissemination  of results  to the Taxi Network  community.  Twenty  eight non- 
smoking  male  NYC cab drivers  will be recruited  and randomized  to one of two study  arms,  
an Intervention  Group  (to receive  the HEPA  filter 2 weeks  into their 4 week  period  of 
participation)  and a Wait-list Control  Group  (to receive  the HEPA  filter at the end of their 4 
weeks  of participation).  For the Intervention  and Wait-list Control  Group  drivers,  during  the 
first 2 weeks,  measurements  (e.g. biological  markers  and air monitoring)  will be taken  
under  usual  conditions.  At the end of the initial  two weeks,  portable  HEPA  air purifiers  
(136)  will be placed  in the Intervention  Group  drivers‘  cars and the air monitoring  and 
biological  parameters  will be repeated  for another  2-week  period,  to determine  changes  in 
PM levels  and physiological  measurements  as a result  of this targeted  intervention.  The 
Wait-list Control  Group  drivers  will not receive  a HEPA  air purifier  at this time,  but will also 
have the air monitoring  and biological  parameters  repeated  for another  [ADDRESS_949476] drivers  
will then receive  a HEPA  air purifier,  so that they may also potentially  benefit  from the 
intervention  being  tested  in this study,  but no further  measurements  will be taken.  Drivers  
will serve  as their own controls  before/after  work  and before  and after the intervention.

Our taxi network  CAB (Community  Advisory/Action  Board)  will be engaged  in the 
implementation  and dissemination  of the proposed  study.  This Taxi CAB represents  the 
full range  of the taxi driver  experience,  including  varied  shifts,  income,  education,  age, 
ownership/lease  arrangements,  and countries  of origin.  The Taxi CAB will be instrumental  
in study  recruitment  and dissemination  of results.  The CAB will meet  quarterly,  with 
additional  meetings  as needed.  This study  is conducted  in collaboration  with Drs. Gordon  
and Zelikoff ‘s research  teams  at [LOCATION_001] University  Department  of Environmental  
Medicine,  and [CONTACT_699478],  working  from the City College  of [LOCATION_001] (CCNY).  
Biological  specimens  collected  will be immediately  transported  to MSK BAIC  Core  facilities  
for temporary  storage  and will be shipped  later to either  NYU or CCNY  (outlined  in the 
assessment  and evaluation -section  7). 
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
Over  the course  of the study,  we will monitor  several  biological  and physiological  markers  
associated  with lung cancer  and CVD risk, along  with ongoing  air monitoring  of work -sites 
and residences  of all study  participants.  HEPA  filters  were  selected  as the intervention  
because  of their effectiveness  in removing  PM and volatile  organic  compounds  (VOCs),  
ease  of use, relatively  low-cost,  small  size, light weight,  and lack of interference  with 
drivers‘  normal  practices  (136).  In a previous  study  by [CONTACT_699433]., placing  the air 
recirculation  mode  on (and with a cabin  air filter in place  already  installed  by [CONTACT_699434],  not all cars have cabin  air filters),  was successful  at substantially  removing  
ultrafine  particles,  although  was still relatively  inefficient  (45.5%  particle  removal  efficiency)  
compared  to a HEPA  filter (137).  
 
The study  will require  4 weeks  of participation.  Drivers  will be recruited  and randomized  to 
either  the control  condition  or the HEPA  filter intervention  condition.  The in-vehicle  (for all 
drivers  PM exposure  levels  and physiologic  and biochemical  markers  will be measured  
over the course  of [ADDRESS_949477] two weeks  of the 1-month  period,  measurements  
will be taken unde r usual conditions ( without HEPA filters) for all participants. 
 
Particulate  matter  concentrations  will be measured/monitored  through  Personal  DataRams  
(pDR)  (personal DataRam™  model  pDR-1200).  The DataRam  measures  particulate  matter  
through  optical  impedance,  and produces  per-minute  averages.  Therefore,  the time that 
the DataRam  is ―on‖ will be directly  reflected  in the data that is produced . The pDR is [ADDRESS_949478]  of their off work hours;  
the DataRam  will then be moved  to the bedroom  at night  (or during  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_449786]).  For 
drivers,  the pDR will record  PM levels  throughout  the work shift while  the vehicle  is in 
motion,  momentarily  stopped,  or parked.  
Black  carbon  exposures  will be measured/monitored  through  BGI [ADDRESS_949479],  6.75 inches  in height,  3.1 inches  in width  
and 2.3 inches  in depth,  which  is ideal for mobile  projects.  It is attached  to an external

Nickel  Metal  Hydride  battery,  which  is 5.75 inches  in height,  3.60 inches  in width  and 1.10  
inches  in depth.  BGI pump  connects  with a Tygon  or ID tubing,  ¼ inch in diameter,  which  
is attached  to a plastic  cassette  on the other  end, where  the pre baked  quartz  filter is 
placed.  The BGI pump  and filter will be placed  in the vehicle  of the participant  at the 
beginning  of their work shift and pi[INVESTIGATOR_699387]. All participants  will 
monitor  black  carbon  exposures  at minimum  for one work  shifts  on week  1 and week  4 of 
the study,  or a maximum  of three  work shifts  every  week.  
 
PAH exposure  will be measured  through  portable  passive  Polyurethane  Foam  Filter  (PUF)  
sampler  sized  10 cm by 2.2 cm diameter  (171).  The PUF filter will be place  in the vehicle  
of the drivers  at the beginning  of their work  shift and pi[INVESTIGATOR_699387]. 
Drivers  will monitor  PAH through  PUF sampler  one day every  week.  
 
The intervention  of HEPA  air filters  will be introd  uced  after 2 weeks  of participation  in the 
Driver  Intervention  group  (but not in those  of the control  drivers‘  cars. The HEPA  air 
purifier  is 7.5‘‘x  8.5‘‘, [ADDRESS_949480],  and a seatbelt  clip to secure  the filter 
(159).  Air monitoring  and measurements  of PM exposure  levels and physiologic  and 
biochemical  markers  will be continued  for another  2-week  period  to assess  the extent  of 
risk reduction  achieved  by [CONTACT_699435].  Two weeks  should  be more  than 
sufficient  to measure  risk reduction  by [CONTACT_699436],  as the study  by [CONTACT_699437]. showed  that with the air recirculation  mode  on and a cabin  filter in place,  in-cabin  
aerosol  concentration  was reduced  to below  typi[INVESTIGATOR_699388]  3 minutes  (137).  HEPA  filters  will be given  to drivers  in the Wait-list Control  
Group  at the end of the 4 weeks  of participation.  
 
 
Physiologic  and biochemical  markers  will be measured  by [CONTACT_699438] 1 work day and 1 non-working  day per week,  for a total of four 
measurements  per week  (see section  7 for details).  Physiologic  and biochemical  markers  
to be measured  include:   high-sensitivity  C-reactive  protein,  blood  pressure,  and reduced  
heart  rate variability  – data to be downloaded  via a smart  phone  (associated  with CVD),  
and pro/anti -inflammatory  cytokines  (i.e., interleukin  (IL)-1b, -6, -8, -10, tumor  necrosis  
factor  (TNF) -α, and interferon  (IFN) -γ), and epi[INVESTIGATOR_699389]/or  inflammation  (see Figure  1 below  and section  7 for details).

Polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbon  (PAH)  exposures  will also be assessed  through  
measurements  of the urinary  metabolite  1 hydroxy  pyrene.  Drivers  will be asked  to give a 
urinary  sample  in the morning  after several  days  of work.  They  will be provided  with a 100 
cc sterilized  polypropylene  container.  (Urinalysis  Cup Kit). This will be collected  by [CONTACT_86492],  protected  from sunlight  and transported  to BAIC  for storage  in a -20 degree  
freezer.  Samples  will ultimately  be analyzed  using  liquid  chromatography -tandem  mass  
spectrometry  (LC-MS-MS) by [CONTACT_699439].  PAH 
exposures  will also be measured  through  PUF sampler  sized  10 cm by 2.2 cm diameter  
(171).  Drivers  will monitor  PAH through  PUF sampler  one work  day every  week.  The PUF 
filter will be place  in the vehicle  of the drivers  at the beginning  of their work shift and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_699387]. The study  team  will transport  the sampler  to the 
collaborating  facility  City College  of [LOCATION_001] for analysis.  
 
The study  team  will be trained  on screening  and recruitment  procedures,  downloading  
DataRam  results  on PM measurements,  on fingerstick  blood,  salivary,  and buccal  swab  
sampling  procedures,  and on storage/handling  of samples  (e.g. shippi[INVESTIGATOR_699390]).  Samples  collected  will be transported  immediately  by [CONTACT_699440].  If any critical  abnormal/irregular  health  measurements  are identified  
in the process  of data collection,  study  staff will be trained  to refer participant  to low-cost 
health  services.  
 
Prior to study  implementation,  the study  team  will conduct  a series  of validation  testing  
along  with necessary  calibration  checks  for all study  equipment   (including   pDRs,  air 
pumps  and HEPA  filters).  Taxi Network  CAB members  will assist  in trial runs to ensure  all 
equipment  and logistical  concerns  are optimized  before  equipment  is provided  to study  
participants.

affiliates  and will be a part of the study  team  to assist  with identifying  potential  study  
candidates  through  their previous  relationships  with the taxi driver  community.  Study  staff 
will enroll  a convenience  sample  of drivers  by [CONTACT_699442] - 
frequented  sites across  NYC- including  taxi garages,  taxi bases,  parking  stands,  taxi relief  
and shift change  stands,  gas stations,  restaurants,  and religious  and community

including  drivers  who are waiting  in their parked  and stationary  vehicles.  Staff will also 
utilize  partnerships  with CBOs  and local and ethnic  newspapers,  radio  stations  and media  
outlets  such  as the Union  Fouta  and Murid  Islamic  Community  of America  radio  station  
and newspaper  to accrue  study  participants.  Flyers  (Appendices  F) for Drivers  will be

various  community  locations  drivers  frequent  including  garages,  taxi bases,  parking  
stands,  gas stations,  restaurants,  religious  and community  organizations  to garner  interest  
in the study.  A screening  tool (see Appendix  A) will be used  to identify  eligible  participants  
(drivers).  All those  who meet  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  will be informed  of the risks and 
benefits  of study participation  and, if willing  to participate,  asked  to read and sign a written  
informed  consent  document.  Consenting  professionals  will use general  teach -back  
method  in which  we will ask drivers  if they understand  what participation  entails  to ensure  
they are informed  of the study  procedures.  
 
Following  informed  consent,  participants  will be assigned  a participant  number  and 
administered  the Intake  Assessment  (Appendix  B). Participant  drivers  will also be 
randomized  to either  the Intervention  or Wait-list Control  Groups,  as described  above.  A

and (3) physical  activity  and nutrition.  (10-15 min to complete)  
 
Log-book  (Appendix  C), given  to drivers  to record  environmental  manipulations  within  the 
area they are driving  or their vehicle.  This includes  air exchange  levels  within  the cab 
(documenting  whether  the DataRam  is used,  HEPA  filter and air conditioning  is on, vents  
and windows  are open,  the vehicle  make  or model  of taxi cab or the neighborhoods  driven  
in during  shift).  This also includes  documenting  neighborhoods  travelled  thru, whether  they 
were  in high traffic  jams,  or travelled  thru tunnels.  In our preliminary  work  (X12-021),  we 
have succeeded  in encouraging  drivers  to complete  a similar  log-book.  When  we meet  
with drivers  to conduct  biological  measurements,  or contact  [CONTACT_699445],  we 
will remind  them  to complete  their log-books  using  the text reminder  system  described  
below.

Environmental  Measurements,  Physiologic  and biochemical  markers  
For all participants,  measurements  for environmental,  physiologic  and biochemical  
markers  will taken  twice  a week,  and twice  per day for a total of four data collection  time 
points  per week.  This will include  one work  day per week  (on the last work  day of their 
work  week)  and on 1 day per week  off from work.  On work  days measurements  will be 
taken  both immediately  before  (to establish  pre-work  biological  parameters)   and 
immediately  after their work  shift, and on non-work days measurement  will be taken  at 
approximately  the same  times  during  their day(s)  off. In addition,  blood  pressure  will be 
measured,  data on heart  rate variability  will be downloaded,  and a blood  sample  will be 
taken  from each  participant  via finger  stick to provide  for measures  of  inflammatory  
markers  and changes  in white  blood  cell profiles.  Salivary  cotinine  levels  will also be 
measured  twice  (once  at Intake  and at the halfway  point)  for all participants  to assess  any 
exposure  to smoking  or smokeless  tobacco  products.  High sensitivity  C-reactive  protein  
will be measured  once  during  Intake  and again  at end of the [ADDRESS_949488]   any 
assessments  at a participant‘s  home.  All measurements  will be collected  by [CONTACT_699447].  Samples  will be collected  and 
transported  immediately  to MSKCC  Core  facilities,  located  on the 4th floor of the Breast  
and Imaging  Center  for storage.  Samples  will be shipped  to NYU facilities  for processing

monitors  (Thermo  Scientific)  that measure  real-time PM levels  (measured  range  = 1 µg 
to 400 µg/m3). For drivers,  the DataRam  will be placed  inside  the cab on the island  
between  driver  and front passenger  seat during  workshifts.  All participants  will monitor  
PM at their homes  in the room  in which  they spend  most  of their off work  hours;  the 
DataRam  will then be moved  to the bedroom  at night (all participants  will receive  daily 
text messages  as reminders  to do this).  The DataRam  will be zeroed  prior to use and 
all data internally  logged  and displayed  on an LCD monitor.   DataRam   PM 
measurement  files (hourly  averages)  will be downloaded  every  week  at the same  time 
as blood/  salivary  samples  are taken.  To maximize  efficiency  in the field, gravimetric  
calibration  will be performed  by [CONTACT_665678] a filter sampler  and programming  of a 
calibration  constant.  Teflon  and quartz  filters  will be used  to capture  PM (a time- 
averaged  sample)  for subsequent  gravimetric  and trace  element  analyses,  including  
sulfur  and organic  and elemental  carbon  analyses  (micro -balance/XRF  instrumentation  
available  at NYU‘s  NIEHS  Center  of Excellence  Facility  Core) . A portion  of the glass - 
fiber filter will be cut for organic  analysis.  This portion  of the filter will be extracted  via 
pressurized  liquid  extraction  (ASE  100 system,  Dionex)  with hexane:  dichloromethane  
(1:1, v/v) at 90C and 1500  psi (140).  The extracts  will be concentrated   using   a 
Turbovap  and cleaned  before  analysis.  BFRs  polybrominated  diphenyl  ethers  (PBDEs)  
will be analyzed  via gas chromatography -mass  spectrometry  with negative  chemical  
ionization  (GC-NCI-MS) (141).  Parent  PAHs  will be analyzed  with GC-MS in electron  
impact  ion (EI) mode  and selected  ion monitoring  (SIM), whereas  nitro-PAHs  and oxy- 
PAHs  (quinones)  will be analyzed  via GC-NCI-MS and SIM (142).  Another  portion  of 
the glass -fiber filter will be cut for metal  analysis.  This portion  of the filter will be 
extracted  via microwave  digestion  and trace  metals  will be analyzed  via inductively  
coupled  plasma -mass  spectrometry  (ICP-MS) according  to the method  of Kulkarni  et 
al.(143).  
DataRam  data downloads  will be sent to study  collaborators  Drs. Gordon  and Zelikoff  
at NYU for analysis.  
 
 
2. Black  carbon  exposure  (measured  at minimum  after 1 work  shifts  during  week  1 and 
week  4, at maximum  will be measured  after 3 work  shifts  every  week)  
In-vehicular  black  carbon  concentrations  will be measured  using  calibrated  BGI 
Personal  Sample  Pumps  (BGI Inc.) (provided  by [CONTACT_58703])  and pre baked  quartz  filters  . 
Using  the constant  air flow, the quartz  filter is able to trap black  carbon  levels  in real 
time.  For drivers,  research  staff will meet  them  at the beginning  of their work shift with 
the BGI pump  fully charged  and the flow rate pre-set to 4L/min.  The filter, sealed  in 
aluminum  foil, will be unwrapped  immediately  before  the sampling,   placed   in  the 
plastic  cassette  using  a tweezer  or forceps  that is attached  to the BGI pump  via Tygon  
tubing.  Staff will turn on the BGI pump  and steadily  place  at the floor of the vehicle  
away  from foot traffic  with the Tygon  tubing  coming  up to the island  in between  the 
driver  and the passenger  seat,  where  the cassette  with the filter would   rest  in  a 
secured  position.  Staff will record  the start flow rate, start sampling  time,  and 
environmental  condition  in a log book.  
At the end of the shift, the staff will meet  the driver  to collect  both USP and the filter.  
Staff will also record  the end flow rate, end sampling  time and changes  in 
environmental  conditions.  The filter will be removed  from the plastic  cassette  using  a 
tweezer  or forceps  and immediately  wrapped  in aluminum  foil and placed  in ice packs  
within  a cooler.  Sampled  filters  will be transported  in coolers  with ice packs  to BAIC  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -247 A(9)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_949489]  flow rates  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897]  2-4 liters per minute)  and 
measurement  time base  (10 to 300 seconds),  the filter will be removed  from the 
sampling  frame,  wrapped  in aluminum  foil, and transported  to the NYU  NIEHS  
laboratory  for analysis  by [CONTACT_699448]. Gordon  and Zelikoff.  There,  a 
standard  punch  of the filter will be used  for sample  analysis.  The filter sample  is 
inserted  into the analyzer,  with a replicate  sample  as needed  for quality  control.  EC 
and OC mass  will be determined  via calculation  using  the analyzer  results  and the 
sample  portion  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897]  1.5cm2), i.e. the area of the standard  punch.   The  entire  
NIOSH  Method  5040,  including  how to make  accommodations  for changes  in sample  
punch  size and other  quality  control  procedures,  will be followed  
(http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003 -154/pdfs/5040.pdf ). 
 
 
3. Blood  pressure  (measured  before  and after work  shift 1 work-day per week  and at 
approximately  same  times  on 1 non-work day per week):  Blood  pressure  will be 
measured  using  a 9002  E-Sphyg  2 Digital  LCD Desk  Unit Sphygmomanometer  
(American  Diagnostic  Corporation;  Hauppauge,  NY). This will be performed  by [CONTACT_699449].  In the event  that study  staff are unable  to coordinate  a date and time to meet  
participants  for BP measures,  study  participants  will have the option  to self monitor  
blood  pressure  using  a portable  MDS3001PLUS  blood  pressure  unit (Medline,  
Mundelein,  Illinois ), which  is given  to the participant  to keep  at their home  during  the 
study.   A log will be provided  (see Lab Manual)  and study staff will contact  [CONTACT_699450].  
 
4. Heart  Rate Variability  (measurements  to be downloaded  once  a week) : Heart  rate 
variability  (HRV)  describes  the time intervals  between  heartbeats  that vary as an 
individual  breathes  in and out (inhalation  and exhalation),  during  a rest state.  The heart  
speeds  up when  you inhale  and slows  down  when  you exhale.  Reduced  heart  rate 
variability  has been  reported  in several  cardiological  and non-cardiological  diseases.  
Participants  will be required  on every  day of study  participation,  to wear  Ithlete  strap  
when  they wake  up and before  going  to bed and sync the chest  strap  monitor  to their 
smart  phone.  Participants  will then follow  breathing  instructions  provided  by [CONTACT_699451].  The ithelete  will download  small  changes  in the heartbeat  
and the variance  will be analyzed.  HRV  will be measured  over time via an Ithlete  ECG  
receiver,  a small  pi[INVESTIGATOR_699392] a heart  rate monitor  
chest  strap.  The chest  strap,  ECG  receiver,  and Ithlete  app will be supplied  to each  
taxi driver  being  tested.  Data are downloaded  via a smart  phone.  (See HRV test 
procedure  in appendix  4 for further  details)  
 
5. Serum  cytokines  and white  blood  cell profiles  (measured  before  and after work 
shift 1 work-day per week  on week  1 and week  4): Serum  cytokines  (i.e., interleukin  
(IL)-1, -6, -8, -10, tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF) -, and interferon  (IFN) -) will be 
measured  using  dried  blood  spot sampling  and MesoScale  Discovery  (MSD)  
immunoassay  system  (www.mesoscale.com ). As done  previously  in collaboration  with 
the EPA,  a drop of blood  will be spotted  onto a  commercial   sampling   paper   and 
allowed  to dry. The sampling  paper  will be labeled  with study  ID, date,  and the initials  
of the person  conducting  the collection.  The paper,  along  with other  study  samples,  will 
be transported  immediately  to the BAIC  Core  facilities,  4th  floor storage  at -80 Freezer,  
until shipped  on ice to our EPA collaborator,  , for analyses.  Blood  samples  for testing

will be obtained  by [CONTACT_699452]  a disc from the center  of the spot,  followed  by a simple  
liquid  extraction  of the sample.  MSD  assays  employ  a sandwich  immunoassay  format  
whereby  [CONTACT_699453] a single  spot on the wells   of a MULTI - 
SPOT  plate.  Multiplex  assays  can measure  1-10 cytokines  in a 96-well MULTI  SPOT  
plate;  each  sample  will be analyzed  in duplicate.  A second  blood  drop from the finger  
stick will be placed  onto a glass  slide,  air-dried,  stored  in a locked  box for later H&E 
staining  and used  for differential  counts  of white  blood  cell profiles  as a systemic  
marker  of inflammation.  Slides  will be shipped  to [CONTACT_699477]  at NYU for analysis.  (See 
blood  prick test procedures  in appendix  4 for details).  
 
 
 
6. High  sensitivity  C-reactive  protein  hs-CRP:  Similar  to the processes  described  
above,  the blood  sample  for hs-CRP  analysis  will be a drop of blood  spotted  onto a 
commercial  sampling  paper  and allowed  to dry. The sampling  paper  will be labeled  
with study  ID, date,  and the initials  of the person  conducting  the collection.  The paper,  
along  with other  study  samples,  will be transported  immediately  to the BAIC  Core  
facilities,  4th floor storage  at -80 Freezer,  for analyses.  (See blood  prick test 
procedures  in appendix  4 for details).  
 
7. Salivary  cotinine  (measured  at Intake  and at the half-way point):  Participants  will be 
directed  to use a saliva  collection  aid with a cryovial  for collection  of 1ml saliva  sample.  
Saliva  sample  can only be collected  at least one half hour after eating  or drinking.  
Saliva  samples  will be frozen  at -20°C.  Cotinine  will be measured  with an EIA 
(Enzyme -immunoassay)  (148).  (See salivary  cotinine  test procedures  in appendix  4 for 
details).  Saliva  samples  will be transported  to MSK BAIC  Core  facilities  for temporary  
storage,  until shipped  to Drs. Zelikoff  and Gordon  at NYU for analysis.  
 
8. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_699377]  (at Intake):  We will use the minimally  invasive  buccal  cell 
approach  to identify  traffic  pollution -related  epi[INVESTIGATOR_699393],  
because  gene  expression  changes  induced  by [CONTACT_699454]/or  nasal  cells reflect  those  in bronchial  epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]  (76, 149, 150).  Buccal  
cells will be collected  from study  participants  by [CONTACT_699455][INVESTIGATOR_699394]  (Gentra  Puregene  Buccal  Cell Kit, 
Qiagen,  Valencia  CA). Methylation -specific  PCR  (MSP)   (151)  will be performed  as 
routinely  (134),  using  HotStar  Taq DNA  Polymerase  kit (Qiagen),  using  MSP primers  
identified  from the literature.  Methylated  (M) or unmethylated  (U) status  will be denoted  
per gene  per participant.  Buccal  samples  will be transported  to MSK  BAIC   Core  
facilities  for temporary  storage  and later shipped  to collaborators  at NYU for analysis.  
(See buccal  swab  test procedures  in appendix  4 for details)  
 
PAH (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon) will be assessed via urine sample 
collection  of Urinary  1 hydroxy  pyrene  and particulate  matter  collected  via 
Polyurethane  Foam  Filter  (PUF)  sampler:  
 
9. PAH via Urinary  1 hydroxy  pyrene: Drivers  will be asked  to give a urinary  
sample  twice  during  the study.  The first urine  sample  will be collected  on the 
morning  at the end of the first or second  work week  of study.  The second  
sample  will be collected  from drivers  on the morning  of the end of the fourth  
week  of study  participation.  Drivers  will be provided  with a 100 cc sterilized

polypropylene  container  (Urinalysis  Cup Kit). This will be collected  by [CONTACT_699456],  protected  from sunlight  and transported  directly  to BAIC  for 
storage  in a -20 degree  freezer.  Samples  will ultimately  be analyzed  using  
liquid  chromatography -tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS-MS).  This analysis  
will be carried  out at the collaborating  facility City College  of [LOCATION_001].  
 
10. PAH via PUF sampler  (measured  at one work  day each  week):  Drivers‘  PAH 
exposure  will be measured  through  portable  passive  PUF sampler  sized  10  
cm by 2.2 cm diameter  (171).  Drivers  will monitor  PAH through  PUF sampler  
one day every  week.  The PUF filter will be place  in the vehicle  of the drivers  at 
the beginning  of their work  shift and pi[INVESTIGATOR_699387]. Sampler  
will be tranported  to collaborating  facility  City College  of [LOCATION_001] for 
extraction  and analysis.  The PUF filter will be extracted  using  dichloromethane  
according  to the method  of Jaward  et al. (172).  The extracts  will be 
concentrated  using  a Turbovap  and cleaned  before  analysis.  Parent  PAHs  will 
be analyzed  with GC-MS in electron  impact  ion (EI) mode  and selected  ion 
monitoring  (SIM), and nitro-PAHs  and oxy-PAHs  (quinones)  will be analyzed  
via GC-NCI-MS and SIM (173). 
 
Genes  in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_699395] (10) genes  that have  
been  informative  as epi[INVESTIGATOR_699396]  (69). 
These  are: p16- tumor  suppressor,  cell cycle  regulator;  hMLH1 - mismatch  DNA repair  
gene;  E-cadherin - cell-cell adhesion  molecule  associated  with epi[INVESTIGATOR_699397];  RARβ2 - binds  retinoic  acid, regulates  cell growth/differentiation  genes;  DAPK - 
serine/threonine  kinase  involved  in gamma -interferon  induced  apoptosis;  RASSF1A - 
interacts  with DNA repair  protein  XPA,  inhibits  cell cycle  arrest;  RUNX3 , regulator   of 
alveolar  differentiation,  frequently  hypermethylated  in lung adenocarcinomas;  and FHIT , 
the most  common  gene  inactivated  in lung cancer  besides  p53. We also include  a few 
inflammatory  response  genes:  IL-4, whose  promoter  methylation  decreased  in mice  
exposed  to diesel  exhaust  (DEP)  and fungus  (152)  and IFNg , interferon  gene  whose  
methylation  increased  in DEP/fungus  exposed  mice.  
 
Pyrosequencing  to detect  global  genome  methylation  levels  (approximated   by  [CONTACT_243552] -1 
repeat  methylation)  will be performed  per Colella  (153)  using  a PSQ96MA  System  
(Biotage/Qiagen).  Recent  studies  show  decreased  LINE -1 methylation  following  exposure  
to traffic  particulates,  PM 2.5 and carbon  black  (71). Because  pyrosequencing  quantifies  
percent  methylation  of individual  CpG sites,  we can also use it for quantitative  analysis  of 
percent  methylation  of genes  in the reference  panel  above,  to supplement  the qualitative  
M/U calls made  by [CONTACT_594619].  While  the gene  choices  in a candidate  gene  approach  are vast, 
support  for the particular  genes  chosen  here is evident  in a recent  study  of non-small  cell 
lung cancer  in Asians  (China)  showing  good  correlation  for RASSF1A,  RARB,  hMLH1,  
p16, RUNX3  and DAPK  with lung cancer  (154).  
Due to the nature  of the study,  staff will handle  and transport  biological  specimens  that are 
categorized  as potential  toxic and infectious  substances  (dangerous  goods -class  6, 
category  b) To ensure  good  clinical  practice  procedures  are followed,  before  study  
activation,  all staff will complete  the Dangerous  Goods  Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_699398].   Additional   biospecimen  
collection  training  procedures  will be provided  by [INVESTIGATOR_353947].

procedures  and trained  to identify  participant‘s  signs  of distress  during  and after 
procedures.  Participants  may on occasion  recognize  problems  or identify  unmet  clinical  
needs  as a result  of participating  in a study  such  as this. If patients  do report  concerns  of 
study  burden,  distress  or mention  specific  medical  concerns  he will be informed  to report  
this concerns  to research  staff who will be trained  to alert study  investigators   who will 
make  referrals  to low cost community  health  services  as appropriate.  
 
9.1 PRIMARY  OUTCOMES  
 
The primary  outcomes  are: 
 
• To collect  preliminary  data on in-vehicle  excess  PM exposure  the personal  
DataRam  will monitor/report  the PM levels  as time-averaged  sample  (hourly  
averages)  that will be monitored  at work  site and at homes  across  all groups  
 
• To conduct  a preliminary  assessment  of the correlation  between  PM exposure  and 
physiologic  and biochemical  markers  associated  with increased  risk of lung cancer  
and CVD the personal  DataRam  will monitor/report  PM levels  (hourly  averages)  
that will be analyzed  in comparison  to increased  systolic  blood  pressure,  reduced  
heart  rate variability,  and presence  of biological  markers  related  to lung cancer  and 
CVD risk. 
 
10.0 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
Participants  may be removed  from the study  protocol  based  on the following  
circumstances:  1) if they choose  to voluntarily  withdraw;  2) they are determined  to be 
ineligible  for the study;  3) they express  significant  distress  related  to completion  of the 
study  (the study  staff will refer the participant  to counseling  and support  services   if 
needed);  or 4) if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_699400]‘s  best interest  to do so. 
11.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
Overview.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_699401]  a two parallel  arm design.  Drivers  will be randomized  to 
one of two groups,  an Intervention  Group  (an in-vehicle  HEPA  filter will be provided)  and a 
Wait-list Control  Group  (HEPA  filter will be provided  at the end of wait-list period).  We plan 
to recruit  a sample  of n=14  participants  in each  group  (n=11  per arm with analyzable  (non- 
missing)  data,  assuming  a 25% drop-out rate as described  below).  
 
General  analytic  strategies.  The general  data analytic  paradigm  for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_699402]. The aim is to collect  pi[INVESTIGATOR_699403]  a future  
randomized  intervention  study.  Descriptive  statistics  and assessments  of correlations  will 
be sought  to address  the aims (see below).  The sample  size of 14 per condition  was 
primarily  determined  by [CONTACT_699458].  A sample  of 14 per condition  was deemed  
possible  within  the funding  resources  of no more  than 2 years.

Analytic plans for the Specific Aims. 
 
Aim 1a: The primary  aim will be to collect  preliminary  data on in-vehicle  excess  PM 
exposure.  
 
Descriptive  statistics  (means  and standard  deviations)  will be sought  on: 1) PM size 
distribution  2) mass  concentration,  and 3) chemical  composition   for  all  three  groups.  
These  observations  will be used  to evaluate  to what extent  the two groups  were  exposed  
to these  environmental  hazards.  For each  study  participant,   an  area-under -the-curve  
(AUC)  summary  will be sought  for each  of the three  PM measurements  over appropriate  
time periods.  Generally,  a daily average  will be calculated  from the hourly  PM 
assessments.  Then  the AUC of the 28 daily averages  will be calculated  per person  to 
represent  the summary  of PM exposures  during  study  participation.  
Aim 1b: To conduct  a preliminary  assessment  of the correlation  between  PM exposure  
and physiologic  and biochemical  markers  associated  with increased  risk of lung cancer  
and/or  CVD.  
 
For each  group,  a correlation  matrix  will be constructed  between  the three  components  of 
the AUC outcomes  described  in Aim 1a and a set of physiologic  and biochemical  markers.  
Generally,  Pearsons‘  correlation  coefficients  will be sought.  If preliminary  analyses  found  
the variables  to be skewed,  then Spearman‘s  rank correlation  coefficients  will be 
calculated  instead.  The purpose  of these  correlation  coefficients  are to examine  the 
associations  between  the environmental  exposure  to air pollutants  and physiologic  and 
biochemical  markers.  Point -biserial  correlation  coefficients  will be sought  between  the 
continuous  AUC summaries  of PM data and other  binary  variables  of interest  (e.g.,  
methylation).  These  correlation  coefficients  can be sorted  in descending  order  to help 
identify  the top candidates  of physiologic  and biochemical  markers  that are most  likely to 
be associated  with PM exposure.  Care  will be taken  to match  the variables  by [CONTACT_5586],  using  
the time stamps  from the PM measurements  and the date of biomarker  serum  collection.  
For example,  the AUC of PM in the first week  will be associated  with serum  cytokines  
measured  during  the first week.  This work  will have to be done  in a post-hoc manner,  
after we have  all data sources.  Then  we will evaluate  the best strategies  to link them  
together  by [CONTACT_5586].  It helps  to have  automatic  time  stamps   by [CONTACT_699459],  which  is likely to minimize  coding  errors  and missing  data.  
 
Aim 2: To use a randomized  wait-list controlled  design  to conduct  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_699378]  
a targeted  intervention,  installation  of a portable  car high-efficiency  particulate  air (HEPA)  
filter (to remove  PM), results  in a reduction  of in-vehicle  PM exposure  and associated  
physiologic  and biochemical  markers  among  taxi drivers..  
 
We will calculate  the difference  in the three  PM components  and in 
physiologic/biochemical  markers  between  the HEPA  intervention  condition  and the Wait- 
List Control  condition  to obtain  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_699404] a future,  larger  study  with the 
potential  to provide  remediation  to potential  harmful  exposures  to air pollution  among  NYC 
taxi drivers.

Aim 3: To collect  feasibility  data on conducting  the proposed  randomized  wait-list 
controlled  pi[INVESTIGATOR_699379].  
 
We will perform  descriptive  statistics  to describe  the feasibility  data collected  in this study  
(number  of participants  approached,  number  refused,  number   droppi[INVESTIGATOR_699405],  time  and 
effort  required  to conduct  the study,  adherence  with the study  protocol  including  carrying  
dataRAMS  to and from home  and work and completion  of the multiple  biological  
measurements,  etc.).  These  data will inform  a future,  large -scale  randomized  controlled  
study.  
 
 
12.1 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES 
 
12.2 Research  Participant  Registration  
 
Confirm  eligibility  as defined  in the section  entitled  Criteria  for Patient/Subject  Eligibility.  
 
Obtain  informed  consent,  by [CONTACT_40136].  
During  the registration  process  registering  individuals  will be required  to complete  a 
protocol  specific  Eligibility  Checklist.  
 
The individual  signing  the Eligibility  Checklist  is confirming  whether  or not the participant  is 
eligible  to enroll  in the study.  Study  staff are responsible  for ensuring  that all institutional  
requirements  necessary  to enroll  a participant  to the study  have  been  completed.  See 
related  Clinical  Research  Policy  and Procedure  #401  (Protocol  Participant  Registration).  
12.3 Randomization  
 
Drivers  will be randomized  to one of the two arms:  1) Driver  Wait list control  arm or 2) 
Driver  Intervention.  After eligibility  is confirmed  and after consent  is obtained,  participants  
will be registered,  and then randomized  using  the MSKCC  Clinical  Research  Database  
(CRDB)  or by [CONTACT_699460] [PHONE_214]  
between  the hours  of 8:30 am and 5:[ADDRESS_949492] copi[INVESTIGATOR_699406]: 14 -247 A(9)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_949493], matching  participants‘  name  [CONTACT_699474] a secure  area at MSKCC.  All questionnaire  data 
completed  by [CONTACT_699461] a study  code  number.  
The data collected  for this study  will be managed  through  UNITY  Web Database,  
questionnaire  and screening  data will be entered  into the research  study  web based  
database  UNITY  maintained  by [CONTACT_30588].  UNITY  Web is a secure  web based  research  
database  application  that was developed  and being   maintained   by  [CONTACT_699462].  The primary  goal of UNITY  Web is to 
streamline  research  data collection  via the Internet  and the ease  of survey  creation.  
Data collection  in UNITY  Web can be accomplished  directly  over the Internet  without  
establishing  a VPN connection.  Eliminating  the VPN connection  requirement  can  be 
crucial  when  conducting  multi-site research  studies  with Institutions  outside  of MSKCC  
locations.  UNITY  Web was developed  using  the latest  Microsoft  .Net Framework  with C# 
and JQuery.  The application  is being  hosted  by [CONTACT_699463].  A number  of various  encryption  methods  were  used  from the 
user interface  to the servers  and as well as the communications  between  servers.  All 
encryption  methods  used  have either  met or exceeded  the requirements  described  in the 
standard  HIPAA  web application  security  guideline.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
13.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Registration  reports  will be generated  regularly  to monitor  patient  accruals  and 
completeness  of registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  
missing  and inconsistent  data.  Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and 
follow -up will be monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  
will be brought  to the attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  Rando m- 
sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_2362].  
 
13.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
were  approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  ―Po licy of the National  Cancer  
Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials‖  which  can be found  at: 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . 
 
The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_699464].  The MSKCC  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found   on  the 
MSKCC  Intranet  at 
https://one.mskcc.org/sites/pub/clinresearch/Documents/MSKCC%20Data%20and%20Saf  
ety%20Monitoring%20Plans.pdf  There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_699465],  safety  and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  
for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  
therapeutic  response,  and staff education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  
procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two institutional  committees  that are 
responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials  programs.  The committees:  
Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the 
Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  report   to  the 
Center‘s  Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for 
its level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH 
sponsored,  in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be 
addressed  and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  
activation.  
13.4 Regulatory  Documentation  
 
Participating  sites that are consulting  and/or  conducting  specimen  or data analysis  should  
submit  this protocol  to their IRB according  to local guidelines.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_699407].

answering.  Confidentiality  of each  subject ‘s self-report  information  and each  patient‘s  
medical  information  will be protected  with the utmost  care.  Each  study  subject  will be 
given  a unique  numeric  identifier  upon  study   entry.  Data sheets  collected   from  each  
subject  will be identified  solely by a code  number.  A list matching  subject  names  and code  
numbers  will be maintained  separately  and kept in a secure  area.  This will preserve  the 
anonymity  of participants.  All data will be used  only for research  purposes.  IRB and HIPAA  
regulations  concerning  confidentiality  will be strictly  enforced.  Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_699408].  Through  the use of password  security  
measures,  restrictions  will be applied  to each  user commensurate  with their needs  to

measures  are identified,  staff will be trained  to alert study  investigators  and research  
manager,  participant  will be referred  to low cost community  health  services.  During  weekly  
assessments,  staff will be trained  to check  in with participants  to identify  if study  
participation  has impacted  their working  environment  (unintended  consequences,  such as 
passengers  and others  asking  them  about  equipment  despi[INVESTIGATOR_699409]).  In the event  
that a concern  is reported  staff will inform  participants  of their right to withdraw  from the 
study  and the study  team  will work  them  to mitigate  problems.  
 
14.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC‘s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  
of protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by [CONTACT_11097]  [INVESTIGATOR_40092]  (IRB/PB).  
 
 
14.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  
judgment,  they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or 
surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
As this is a minimal  risk study,  we will only report  SAEs  (including  deaths)  that are 
believed  to be at least possibly  related  to the protocol  intervention.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.   SAE reporting  is 
required  for 30-days after the participant‘s  last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  
Any events  that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to 
protocol  treatment  must  be reported.

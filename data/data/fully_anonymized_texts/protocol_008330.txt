Determine the Efficacy  and Safety of AP0302  in the Treatment of 
Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)

OBJECTIVE(S)  Primary objective : 
• To evaluate the efficacy of AP0302 5%  (  
 in DOMS of the elbow flexors in generally healthy 
subjects  
Secondary objective:  
• To evaluate the safety of AP0302  in DOMS  of the elbow 
flexors in generally healthy subjects 
STUDY DESIGN  This is a Phase 2/3 , randomized, single- center, double -blind, 
vehicle -controlled, parallel -group study designed to determine the 
efficacy and safety of AP0302  (  
 for the treatment of muscle 
pain/soreness  associated with DOMS.   Enough subjects will be 
screened to randomize 250 subjects.  
Subjects will be screened up to 28 days prior to Day 1 .  After 
completing the info rmed consent and screening  processes, the 
following  procedures will be completed: physical examination, 
medical history and concomitant medications collections, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria review, baseline laboratory testing, 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram (EC G), pregnancy testing (females of child -bearing 
potential), drug and alcohol testing , and vital sign measurements.  
Subjects who meet initial inclusion/exclusion criteria will be scheduled to return to the research center to  undergo an exercise 
regimen  
.   
Between  following the end of the exercise regimen, 
subjects will return to the clinic to be evaluated for eligibility into the 
active treatment phase of the study. 
To qualify  for randomization, subjects mus t report a

Other Secondary Endpoints:  
1. Sum of time -weighted differences from baseline in muscle 
stiffness with movement  (SSID MOVE ) over the following 
intervals:  0-6, 6-12, 0- 12, 12- 24, 0- 24, 0- 36, 24- 48, and 0- [ADDRESS_375368] -T0.

Protocol Amendment 3 AP-007 Version: 02-Jul-2018 8 ANALYSIS 
POPULATIONS  Three analysis populations will be used: 
Safety Population:  all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study 
drug.   
Full Analysis Set (FAS):  all subjects who are randomized, receive at 
least [ADDRESS_375371]-baseline efficacy 
assessment.  
Per Protocol Set (PPS):  all subjects in the FAS without a major 
protocol deviation.  The sponsor will identify  which protocol 
deviations are considered major before unblinding the study.  
PRIMARY ENDPOINT 
ANALYSIS  The primary efficacy endpoint will be the SPID MOVE  for [ADDRESS_375372]-T0.  The  muscle pain/soreness  intensity differences  will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_306623]-T 0 muscle pain/soreness  intensity  
score from the baseline muscle pain/soreness  intensity  score.  The 
weight given to each pain intensity difference  (PID) will be equal to 
the elapsed time since the previous evaluation.  
The mean SPID MOVE  for [ADDRESS_375373] -T0 will be compared between 
treatments using an analysis of covariance model with baseline muscle 
pain/soreness  score as a covariate .

• Full Analysis Set (FAS): all subjects who are randomized, receive at least [ADDRESS_375414]-baseline efficacy assessment.

time 0, T

14.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Analysis 
The primary efficacy outcome is the sum of the time-weighted differences from baseline in 
muscle pain/soreness with movement (SPID MOVE ) over 0-[ADDRESS_375417]-T 0 (SPID MOVE  0-24h), that 
is the area under the differences from baseline pain/soreness intensity difference curve. 
The PI[INVESTIGATOR_306618] A to time point B will be calculated using the 
trapezoid rule by [CONTACT_306623]-T 0 pain score with movement from the pain score with 
movement at time point T i as follows: 
•PID with movement at time point i (PID MOVE  i) = NRS score with movement at time point
i – NRS score with movement  at baseline.
•Mean of adjacent pain intensity differences M MOVEi  = (PID MOVE i  +  PID MOVE  i+1) / 2
•The weight given to each M MOVE  i score (W i) = elapsed time to the next  evaluation (ti+1 –
ti).

time point between A and B (not including B).

point between baseline and 24 hours.

Where i refers to each scheduled assessment time point between a and b hours post 
baseline, t i is the ith time point and PID i is the pain intensity difference at time i 
The mean SPID MOVE  for 0-[ADDRESS_375418]-T 0 will be compared between the 2 treatment groups 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline pain/soreness score as a 
covariate.  
14.4.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints and Analyses 
Following the similar formula mentioned in the previous section, the following SPID MOVE  for the 
different time intervals will be estimated and compared for the 2 treatment groups using the same 
ANCOVA model. 
• SPID MOVE  over the following intervals: 0-6, 6-12, 0-12, 12-24, 24-36, 0-36, 24-28, 36-48, 
and 0-[ADDRESS_375419]-T 0 will be compared between the 2 treatment groups 
(active versus vehicle) using an ANOCVA model with the baseline pain/soreness score as the covariate. 
14.4.3 Other Secondary Analyses 
The following other secondary endpoints for different time intervals will be compared between 
the 2 treatment groups using an ANCOVA model with the baseline pain/soreness score as the covariate. 
• SSID MOVE  over the following intervals: 0-6, 6-12, 0-12, 12-24, 0-24, 0-36, 24-48, and 
0-[ADDRESS_375420]-T 0 will be compared between the 2 treatment groups (active versus 
vehicle) using an ANOCVA model with the baseline muscle stiffness score as the covariate.

(or upon early termination if the subject withdraws prior to the 48-hour assessment).  The 
distribution of 5 categories (poor, fair, good, very good, or excellent) will be compared between 
the 2 treatments (active versus vehicle) using the Chi-Squared test.  In addition, the 5 categories will be dichotomized into 2 categories (good/very good/excellent versus poor/fair).  The proportion of good, very good, and excellent ratings will be calculated for each treatment.  This proportion will be compared between the 2 treatments (active versus vehicle) using the Fisher’s Exact test.

summarized for categorical variables.  Since all subjects will receive vehicle on the dominant arm in addition to blinded study drug on the non-dominant arm, some subjects will receive both active and vehicle treatments.

Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA) 
version 19.1 (or higher).  For summary tables, AEs coded to the same preferred term will be counted only once within a given subject.  If an AE was recorded on multiple occasions in the 
same treatment period, only the highest severity and the highest degree of relationship to the 
study drug will be presented.  If [ADDRESS_375425] dose of study drug.  Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC), and preferred term.  Summaries will be prepared for all AEs, treatment-related AEs, and SAEs.  The

specific to the arm, such as application site reactions, will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148] (active versus vehicle).  
Changes from baseline in chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis parameters will be 
summarized descriptively.  Laboratory results will be classified as low, normal, or high according 
to the laboratory-supplied reference ranges.  Shift tables describing out-of-range shifts from

started prior to the day of the first dose of study drug.  Concomitant medications  are defined as any 
medications taken on the day of or after the first dose of study drug.  Prior and concomitant 
medications  will be coded usi ng the WHO Drug Dictionary version of September [ADDRESS_375426] w ill be counted only

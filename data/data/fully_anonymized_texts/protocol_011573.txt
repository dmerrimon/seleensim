Application Number: HP -[ADDRESS_171587] suggested that electroencephalograpic (EEG) measures 
of peak alpha frequency might provide a means of objective pain assessment. In healthy subjects, 
increased peak alpha frequency is strongly correlated with pain self -reports after exposure to acute 
noxious heat.  Conversely, chronic pain patients compared to healthy con trol display decreased peak 
alpha frequencies higher in alpha power. Measures of peak alpha frequency also show a negative 
relationship with disease duration ( de Vries  et al., 2013 ), suggesting that peak alpha frequency may not 
only index ongoing pain but also disease progression.  
While a simple EEG -based test could provide a useful diagnostic tool for assessing pain objectively, no 
study to date has evaluated this potential in a systematic way. Here we propose to build on our ongoing 
work to develop a rel iable and simple measure of pain. Our overall aim is to determine the predictive 
accuracy, reliability, and specificity of EEG alpha activity in acute pain and a model of neuropathic pain in 
healthy subjects.   
3. Purpose/specific aims/objectives and hypothesi s 
Our overall aim is to determine the predictive accuracy, reliability, and specificity of EEG alpha activity in 
acute pain and a model of neuropathic pain in healthy subjects.  
Aim 1. To determine how the experience of innocuous and noxious stimulation affects alpha activity and 
whether alpha activity can predict acute and neuropathic -like pain.  
Aim 2. To assess the test -retest reliability of the alpha frequency as an objective measure of pain in two 
different experimental pain states (acute and neuropat hic-like).  
If our approach is successful it would be a major step forward to providing an objective measurement of 
pain. This approach could be adopted by [CONTACT_149115]. 
Once we have optimized the procedure , the setup could be simplified to only include a few recording 
electrodes and would thus be a relatively quick method. Future work would also include testing the 
effects of analgesics versus placebo in healthy subjects, as well as in chronic pain patients , to determine 
whether this method could provide a sensitive test of drug efficacy that would not rely on subjective 
ratings.  
4. Research design  
[ADDRESS_171588] three weeks. A flow chart of the events can be seen in the figure . 
Using a 64 -channel EEG system, peak alpha frequency will be measured while participants undergo a 
baseline, pain -free resting state (no stimulation), an acute pain re sting state, a return from pain resting 
state, and a neuropathic -like pain (ongoing pain) resting state.

Visit 0 is an eligibility screening visit that consists of drug testing  (randomly selected with 1/10 
probability) , a health screening, and quantitative sensory testing (QST) with thermal stimulation by 
[CONTACT_149116]. Upon arriving at the imaging site, participants will complete 
all relevant consent, demographic, and questionnaire forms. Participants will then undergo a brief 
sensory testing session, using the Medoc Pathway system, to assess the temperature at which each 
individual first feels pain (pain threshold). All sensory testing will occur with a thermode placed on the 
left volar forear m.  
A subject is eligible to continue to complete one or  two EEG study visits once the study team confirms 
that the subject’s warmth detection (WDT) and heat pain thresholds (HP T) are in the range of normal 
values  (WDT of less than 39°C, HPT between 41 and  47°C ) and that the subject has a pain reaction to 
capsaicin cream. The EEG study visit (s) consist of a sequence of resting state EEG sessions. During all 
resting state sessions, moment to moment fluctuations in pain ratings will be collected in order to t est 
their relationship to peak alpha frequency.  
Subjects will then complete two separate EEG visits ; all visits (V0 -V2) are  separated by [CONTACT_149117]. Using a 64 -channel EEG system, peak alpha frequency will be measured while participants 
undergo a  baseline, pain -free resting state (no stimulation), an acute pain resting state, a return from 
pain resting state, and a neuropathic -like pain resting state. During all resting state sessions, moment to 
moment fluctuations in pain ratings will be collecte d in order to test their relationship to peak alpha 
frequency.  
At the start of Visit [ADDRESS_171589] a urine toxicity (and take 
pregnancy test for female subjects ) screen and reassess the participant’s eligibility. N ext, participants 
complete questionnaire. We will then prepare participants for EEG recordings with a 64 -channel EEG cap 
and auxiliary recordings of skin conductance, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and ECG. To ensure consistent head electrode 
placement across participants t he two frontal electrodes, FP1 and FP2, will be placed a distance from 
the eyebrows equal to 10% of the total skull diameter (measured from the eyebrows to the inion  
Experimental paradigm. Subjects are tested on  one or  two separate visits and undergo multiple types 
of painful and nonpainful stimulation while E EG is continuously recorded.

 landmark). The center array electrode, Cz, will be placed at a distance from the inion and  eyebrow that 
is equal to 50% of the total skull diameter. Once the cap has been placed appropriately, conducting gel 
will be passed through each head electrode until electrode impedance falls below the [ADDRESS_171590] feels pain (pain threshold). All sensory testing will 
occur with a thermode placed on the left volar fo rearm.  
Prior to beginning the formal experiment, participants will complete a one minute eyes open resting 
state and a one minute eyes closed resting state. These two sessions will be used to identify each 
individual’s alpha frequency band.  
The following  resting state scans are completed in a darkened testing room with subjects instructed to 
close their eyes, remain still, and avoid falling asleep. All resting state scans are five minutes in length 
except for the acute pain condition which is comprised of  five, one minute resting state scans. During all 
scans, pain ratings will be captured with an analog response device. Scans are sepa rated by [CONTACT_149118] . 
Condition 1:  innocuous. The thermode is set to a baseline temperature of 32°C (skin temperatur e).  
Condition 2:  acute pain. The thermode will be set to the temperature that previously produced 
moderate pain intensity.  
Condition 3:  neuropathic -like pain. A topi[INVESTIGATOR_55594] 10% capsaicin cream will be placed on the 
participant’s left volar for earm and covered with a Tegaderm bandage. A 40°C thermode will placed 
directly on top of the capsaicin, and incubation will occur for twenty minutes. 40°C is confirmed as a 
temperature below  the participant’s  pain threshold at V0. A five minute resting sta te EEG session 
follows incubation.  
Condition 4:  return to baseline. Following completion of the acute pain and neuropathic -like pain 
conditions, an ice -pack will be placed directly over the recently stimulated skin. The icepack will be held 
in place for fi ve minutes. Pain ratings will be assessed to ensure that pain reports return to baseline 
levels. Following five minutes of icepack application, the ice pack will be removed and the thermode 
placed on the skin at skin temperature.  
5. Relevant prior experience  and gaps in current knowledge  
While a simple EEG -based test could provide a useful diagnostic tool for assessing pain objectively, no 
study to date has evaluated this potential in a systematic way. Here we propose to build on our ongoing 
work to develop a  reliable and simple measure of pain.   
6. Background, rationale, and significance , and supporting literature  
Neurophysiological investigations of pain have suggested that peak alpha frequency might provide a 
means of objective pain assessment. In healthy subjects, increased peak alpha frequency is strongly 
correlated with pain self -reports after exposure to acute  noxious heat (Nir et al., 2010 ). Conversely, 
chronic pain patients compared to healthy control display decreased peak alpha frequencies higher in 
alpha power (Sarnthein et al., 2006 ). Measures of peak alpha frequency also show a negative

7 
 relationship with disease duration (de Vries  et al., 2013 ), suggesting that peak alpha frequency may not 
only index ongoing pain but also disease progression. Another important factor is that these outcomes 
are often observed from temporal and central electrodes overlying the secondary 
somatosensory/posterio r insular region (S2/pI[INVESTIGATOR_149107]) (Dowman et al., 2008 ), which strongly tracks 
nociceptive input and is potentially essential to the experience of pain (Garcia -Larrea, 2012 ). This is 
important as it indicates that peak alpha frequency not only appears to index pain but originates from a 
site is both easily accessible with EEG and biologically plausible.  
As part of a larger study, o ur lab recently collected peak alpha frequencies from healthy individuals 
during exposure to capsaicin and a previously innocuous heat stimulus, which we herein refer to as 
“neuropathic -like pain.” This protocol induces hyperalgesia and allodynia in a larg e majority of 
individuals, making it a clinically relevant model since it matches several characteristics of chronic 
neuropathic pain (Baron et al., 2009 ). Specifically, the capsaicin model induces sustained burning pain, 
with periods of  spontaneous pain, brush allodynia, and heat hyperalgesia. These symptoms are common 
to several neuropathic pain disorders such as diabetic neuropathy and complex regional pain syndrome. 
Other models of ongoing pain in experimental settings include infusio n of hypertonic saline into the 
muscle or the use of a prolonged pressure stimulus. The capsaicin method is the model of choice in the 
current protocol because we can control  the pain intensity level for an extended period of time with the 
application of a  warm thermode at a temper ature below the pain threshold . The application of a 
thermode on the capsaicin is required to achieve a consistent pain intensity rating. Some subjects 
experience mild ongoing (spontaneous) pain  even in the absence of a thermode, but the majority of 
subjects require  the application of a warm thermode. Because we use a low temperature thermode, 
there is no increased risk of damaging the tissue. We use this method in several other ongoing studies in 
the laboratory and find we can con sistently achieve a prolonged pain state in subjects who respond to 
capsaicin . In direct contrast to what has been found with an acute painful stimulus alone, our analysis 
revealed a negative relationship between measured peak alpha frequency and reported pain scores at 
both temporal and central electrodes. The greater pain intensity an individual reported, the lower their 
observed peak alpha frequency was, mirroring the lower peak alpha frequencies found in chronic pain 
patients. Furthering this parallel, we found that peak alpha frequency power was higher following 
capsaicin administration than it was during an otherwise -identic al, but pain -free resting state.  
While our results suggest peak alpha frequency may distinguish between acute and neuropathic -like 
pain states, further work is needed to determine how individual differences affect peak alpha frequency 
across pain states as well as to assess the test -retest reliability of peak alpha frequency during pain 
states.

Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST)  
All quantitative sensory testing will be performed on the face, arm, and neck.  
Test for Warmth, Cool, and Heat Pain Detection Thresholds, Heat Pain Ratings.  Trained study staff will 
perform thermal warm, cool, and heat pain testing procedures using a computer controlled Medoc 
Pathway system. To familiarize participants with the stimuli, there will be an initial trial in which the 
temperature of the thermode is slowly decreased or increase d to the maximum tolerable levels. The 
participant will hold the thermode and remove it from the skin when it becomes intolerable. Thresholds 
are determined by [CONTACT_149121][INVESTIGATOR_149108], or until the participant reports pain. The experimenter will 
then determine the temperature that is consistently rated as moderately painful by [CONTACT_2931] a 
temperature above the threshold level and asking the participant to r ate the pain from 0 (no pain) to 
100 (most intense pain imaginable)  on a continuous visual analog scale  (COVAS) . The testing for this part 
will be performed on the participant’s left volar forearm. The temperature that gives a consistent rating 
of about [ADDRESS_171598] for Offset Analgesia.  Offset analgesia involves applying a temperature of 47 °C to the arm, b riefly 
increasing the temperature to 48 °C, then returning back to 47 °C. A dramatic reliable effect is seen when 
the temperature is lowered: the pain decreases well below the level previously experienced at 47 °C 
(Martucci et al., 2012;Grill and Coghill, 2002) . The thermode will be strapped to the volar forearm, with 
a baseline temperature of 32 °C. The subject will use the COVAS to continuously rate pain on a 0 – [ADDRESS_171599] is ready, the experimenter will begin the trial. The thermal probe rises to 47 °C 
with a ramp rate of 10 °C/s. the temperature remains at 48 °C for 4 -7 s (T1), then increases to 48 °C for 4 -6 
s (T2),  then returns back to 47 °C for 30 s. The following metrics are recorded, according to (Martucci et 
al., 2012;Grill and Coghill, 2002) : Max T2 (the maximum intensity rating following the increase to 5 0°C), 
minimum offset latency, min offset, VAS end latency. The procedure is repeated at least three times,

Application Number: HP -[ADDRESS_171600] 30 seconds between trials, and the thermode is moved to a different position on the 
forearm /face/neck  for each trial. The T1 and T2 dur ations for the three trials are: 4s/5s, 7s/4s, 5s/6s. We 
will subsequently test for offset analgesia at each body site while a second stimulus is simultaneously 
applied to another body site. This will be done for the following combinations of body sites: a rm/face, 
left arm/right arm. Participants will be instructed to rate the pain intensity at one of the two sites using 
the COVAS.  
Test for Brush Allodynia.  This test is performed last, after incubation at V0 and after rekindle at V1 and 
V2. The capsaicin  cream and film cover are removed, and the arm area is cleaned with alcohol  and the 
original 1 inch square site is marked . The  area of se condary hyperalgesia on the participant’s arm is 
measured  with a foam paintbrush dragged at 1 cm per second along four li near paths arranged vertically 
and horizontally around the marked capsaicin site. Brush stimulation from each direction is  started 
outside the hyperalgesic area, and continued towards the marked square until the participant  report s a 
change in sensation (`burning', `ten derness', `pain’). The border i s marked on the skin with a marker  
from each direction . Finally the flare outs ide the capsaicin site is traced on  transparency paper.  
EEG 
The EEG session will last about 2 hours and wil l include the following runs: 1 minute open eyes resting 
state, 1 minute  closed eyes resting state, 5  minute s run of baseline -acute resting state, 5 minute run of 
acute -painful resting state, 5 minute run  of acute -return baseline resting state, 15 minute r un of 
capsaicin cream incubation, , 5 minute run  of chronic -painful resting state, and 5 minute run of chroni c-
return baseline resting state, 5 minute run of chronic -painful resting state  (rekindle).   
Urine Screening  
Urine screening will be decided randomly , by [CONTACT_149122] 1 of 10 envelopes that 
s/he opens to reveal his or her assignment . 9 of the envelopes contain a paper that says ‘No’ to indicate 
no urine test  and 1 envelope contains a paper that says ‘Yes’ to indicate a urine test will be conducted. 
Urine samples will be collected and immediately discarded after screening for drug toxicology. A urine 
sample for toxicology screening testing will be collected in a urine collection cup.  The toxicology 
screening will be performed using Instant -View [ADDRESS_171601], the 
staff will ask the participant about any medications she /he might be taking that could affect the results 
of the test. Participants who fail the drug screening will not be eligible to continue  with the study. 
Results from  the urine test will be recorded by [CONTACT_149123]’s study flow form.

1970) . 
Situational Catastrophizing Questionnaire (SCQ).  This is a short 6 -item questionnaire rated on a 5 -point 
scale ranging from 0 = “not at all” to 4 = “all the time” administered immediately following the Acute -
painful resting state and Chronic -painful resting state EEG runs. The SCQ assesses the subject’s  thoughts 
and feelings during the pain session.  
Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS ). This questionnaire consists of 13 items rated on a 5 -point scale ranging 
from 0 = “not at all” to 4 = “all the time”. Subjects indicate the degree to which they have specifie d 
thoughts and feelings when experiencing pain. This instrument assesses 3 domains of catastrophizing: 
rumination, magnification, and helplessness (Sullivan , 1995;Sullivan et al., 1995) . 
Short form McGill pain ( SFMPQ) . In this brief questionnaire, the subject rates a pain descriptor word 
such as “stabbing” on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Subjects complete the scale with respect to their 
usual headach e pain and their current headache pain. The SFMPQ -2 will assess the type of pain the 
patient is experiencing, which can be compared to databases of many pain disorders (Melzack, 
1987;Dworkin et al., 2009) .  
Beck  Depression Inventory (BDI -II). This is a 21 -question multiple -choice  self-report inventory  that 
assesses the severity of depression in adults (Beck et al., 1988). If the participant’s score on this scale is 
29 or above, or if the participant scores greater than 0 on the suicide item, we will take the following 
steps: 1) ask the partici pant if these feelings have changed recently; 2) ask the participant if he or she 
has a plan if these feelings have been changing (i.e. a plan to seek care); 3) ask the participant if it is 
possible that they might cause harm to themselves or to others bec ause of these feelings. In the case 
that the participant shows the potential to harm themselves or others or a lack of self care, the 
participant will be escorted to psychiatric services or an emergency department. In the case that the 
patient seems unlike ly to harm themselves or others, the participant will be asked to follow -up with a 
primary care physician  or counselor. We will offer to help identify these services if necessary. 
Additionally, if the participant scores greater than 0 on the suicide item, they  will also complete the 
Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS), which is an industry standard for assessment of suicide 
risk severity. The study team member will then decide on the appropriate action, erring on the side of a 
psychiatric consul t at the emergency department when in doubt. In the event of potential immediate 
risk for suicidal behavior the participant will be accompanied to the ER.

 11. Risks and benefits  
Research -related risk, likelihood/seriousness of the risk, and provisions for minimizing the risk  
Some of the heat stimuli  will be painful to participants . Participants  will be able to stop the stimulation 
(the heat or cold on the skin) at any time if participants  find it too uncomfortable. The stimulation 
equipment is designed not to exceed safe temperatures, but there is a small chance  of short -lasting 
tissue injury such as redness, tenderness, and/or in very rare cases minor blistering at the site where 
heat has been applied. Any effects should go away within [ADDRESS_171604] been made to the manufacturers or the FDA. (The FDA is the government agency 
that oversees the safety of drugs, vaccines, and medical devices.)  
During each visit participants  will be asked to endure  controlled experimental pain.  For the temporary 
pain, participants  will be exposed to a hot temperature for a total of [ADDRESS_171605] to end the 
experiment at any time at each session. Any re sidual pain can be eliminated by [CONTACT_2931] a cold wet 
cloth.  
From wearing the EEG cap , participants  may experience slight sensations and irritation as the scalp is  
lightly rubbed at the recording sites. There is some risk that the skin may be broken during  the EEG cap 
preparation, however this is rare in our lab. Also, a small number of people may be  allergic to the 
conducting gel and/or adhesive used to attach the other sensors on the skin, but  this is rare. Please let 
us know if participants  are experienc ing irritation around sensor placement areas.  Lastly, if participants  
experience a temporary reddening of the skin around any of the sensor sites, this  typi[INVESTIGATOR_149109].  
Participants  may feel at unease when reading or responding to personal questions. Participants  can 
refuse to answer any question and stop at any time.  
There is a very small risk for breach of confidentiality of the information that participants  provide for 
this study. We will do the most we can to keep their  informat ion secure and confidential. Loss of 
confidentiality will be minimized by [CONTACT_149124] a locked cabinet and on password -protected 
computers.  
Participants will be asked to contact a study team member to report unanticipated events or potential 
adverse ev ents (see Data and safety monitoring plan).  
Potential direct benefit(s) to participants  
There is no direct benefit to participants.  
Importance of the knowledge expected to result from the study  
The study will provide critical knowledge about the brain mechanisms of pain . We study this by 
[CONTACT_149125] . This could lead to an objective test of sensitivity  to pain and could guide preventive and 
therapeutic approaches to chronic pain in future work.   
Date:  6/6/2018  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_10086] A. Seminowicz, Ph.D.  
Application Number: HP -[ADDRESS_171606], but potentially great g ains for the pain research community from 
the outcomes of the present study. The potential risks to participants associated with sensory testing  
and EEG are minimal. The thermal stimulation device delivers temperatures that produce the perception 
of pain w ithout creating any lasting effects such as a burn to the skin, unlike situations commonly 
encountered in daily life (burning of the mouth on hot coffee or pi[INVESTIGATOR_6107], burning a hand on a stove). The 
benefits of identifying brain mechanisms associated with diff erent types of pain  are potentially very 
great for the pain research community, as the information may lead to developi[INVESTIGATOR_149110] a biomarker for pain sensitivity . 
Alternatives to participation in this study  
Participation is v oluntary and the alternative to participating is to not participate.  
12. Withdrawal or Removal  
Subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request, and the 
investigator may withdraw a subject from participation for any of the  following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of consent.  
• Subject noncompliance with the protocol that results in inability to assess primary 
outcomes.  
• Any event, condition, or situation that would make continued participation in the study not 
in the best interest of the subject, as determined by [CONTACT_093].  
• Investigator discretion.  
Whether a participant has completed all the requirements of the study or decides to terminate his or 
her participation before all the requirements are met, we ask nothing further of t hat participant. If the 
participant has completed a partial  session, the data collected in that time may  be used in the group 
analyses.  
13. Privacy  
Screening, consent, and t esting will be done in private rooms. Study team members who have access to 
participant  names will not talk about participants using names, whether in private or public. When 
contact[CONTACT_39361], information about the study will only be given directly to the 
participant.  
Potential participants will receive research information f rom recruitment posters around the Baltimore 
area and university campuses, including UMB , UMMS,  UMBC , and Johns Hopkins.  Further information 
will be given via telephone when the potential participant calls the phone number on the recruitment 
letter or pos ter. 
14. Confidentiality  
Participants will be numerically coded upon enrollment. Only the team members directly involved with 
the participants will have access to their names, and once a participant has completed the study, only 
numerical codes will be used. The original list with the codes and names will be securely locked.

Data Safety Monitoring by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_149112] -annually.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_149113], Purdue Pharma LP . 
Data to be reviewed include enrollment, adverse events, unanticipated events, and preliminary 
analyses.  
Participants will be asked to contact a study team member to report unanticipated even ts or potential 
adverse events.  
16. Payment  
For their time, participants will be compensated $25 for the eligibility screening visit and $75 per EEG 
visit. Payments will be made by [CONTACT_9434].   
17. Sample  size calculation  
The target sample size for this study is 120 healthy  male and female subjects . This number is based on 
our preliminary data  and accounts for variability in the response to capsaicin (about 10% of people do 
not react to topi[INVESTIGATOR_41956]).   Additionally, this sample size is sufficiently powered to capture a 
moderately size relationship (r > .3) between pain and peak alpha frequency, according to a correlation 
power analysis with a Type I error rate of .05 and a Type II error rate of .2.  The sample size is also 
sufficient for performing multivariate analyses, which will allow us to develop data -driven algorithms for 
pain sensitivity.  
18. Data analysis plan  
Data Analysis Approach  
Data preprocessing for all resting state scans will proceed as foll ows: data will be re -referenced to the 
average of the two ear electrodes, band -pass filtered, removed of obvious non -brain (i.e. movement) 
artifacts, and epoched into [ADDRESS_171607] fourier transform will be 
applied to e ach epoch. The resulting spectral information will then be averaged across epochs. This 
spectral information will then be exported to Matlab where it will be analyzed with custom scripts 
developed in our laboratory. Activity in the alpha frequency band (8 -12hz) will serve as the primary 
frequency band of interest.  
Interim  Data Analysis  
Following acquisition of five full data sets, preliminary analyses will occur to assess the primary study 
outcomes and provide an opportunity to modify the protocol if necess ary.  
Aim 1. To determine how the experience of innocuous and noxious stimulation affects alpha activity.  
Date:  6/6/2018  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_10086] A. Seminowicz, Ph.D.  
Application Number: HP -[ADDRESS_171608] reliability of the alpha frequency as an objective measure of pa in in two 
different experimental pain states (acute and neuropathic -like).  
Here, we will identify the degree to which alpha frequency under various pain states remains constant 
across this time. This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_149126], an d the differences between 
them, across testing sessions. If alpha frequency observations remain stable, within an individual, across 
testing sessions, this will provide important evidence that alpha frequency, and how it shifts, may 
represent an individual ly based characteristic or biomarker.  
19. Informed Consent Process  
Process:  Once participants  have received the initial telephone screening and approval, as described 
above, they will be invited to participate in an experiment. The study  date will be arranged and the 
participant will arrive on that date. Before any research procedures begin, the participant will receive 
the consent form and will be given an opportunity to read the forms and ask questions before agreeing 
or refusing to consent. If the participan t refuses consent, they will not be enrolled in the study . 
Who will obtain consent:  A research team member  will obtain consent.  
Setting:  Consent will be attained in a private testing room, where only the research team member  and 
participant will be present . 
Provisions for understanding:   Before the participant signs the consent form, the research team member 
will ask the participant if he or she understands what he or she has read in the consent form and if he or 
she has any questions. The research team mem ber will then proceed with the Evaluation to Sign 
Consent form (attached) consisting of several questions. Upon successful completion of this evaluation, 
the consent form can be signed.

mostly complex and not very effective, so that the full benefits of treatment cannot be realized. High 
priority should be given to fundamental and applied research concerning innovations to assist patients to

system remains common among today’s Black Belt residents, 75% of whom are black. Internet connections are sporadic, and most families do not have access to computers. Table 1  shows the substantial mismatch of need and 
resources in this region. In 2011, there were 2 certified diabetes educators in an 8 -county area that includes our 
community partners; all are Health Professional Shortage Areas. The result of this mismatch is so bering: fully [ADDRESS_685983] diabetes mortality rates are rural counties.

An alternative perspective is a biopsychosocial framework based on the work of Corbin and Strauss, and of Charmaz.
14,15 Corbin and Strauss interviewed hundreds of people living with chronic disease, thus their 
framework is highly patient -centered. They proposed that three essential elements interactively stabilize and 
reinforce each other to create the sense of well -being: 1) our Body , 2) our personal vision of our  Biography 
through life, and 3) our Conceptions of self. This inter-related triad has been called the BBC chain to emphasize 
how interlinked each element is (Figure 1). Our conceptions of self are how we view ourselves, including our 
roles in the family, at work and in our communities, as well as our social and spi[INVESTIGATOR_528420]. Our biography, referred to by [CONTACT_528505], is our image of what our lives will look like into the future in order  to fulfill our conceptions of ourselves. Illness causes our bodies to fail, impacting this biography and 
forcing us to rewrite it and reconfigure our conception of self. Three types of work are created: work to preserve, 
restore and recast our self -image and identity; work to rewrite the biography; and the work of mourning for the 
passing of our old self and its previous hopes, dreams and identities. The reconfiguration of our self -view is 
extremely stressful, and people take varying amounts of time to est ablish a new equilibrium, with some never 
achieving enough balance to feel well again. This could explain why so many people deny that they have the 
disease, and don’t take medications as recommended even years after their diagnosis.   
Viewed from this perspective, we can make sense of the decision not to take beneficial medicines. Adams 
interviewed asthmatics to better understand why so many fail to take effective medications as prescribed.16 Three 
groups of patients emerged: the deniers, the accepters and those in between. The deniers refused to acknowledge 
that they had asthma at all, despi[INVESTIGATOR_528421]; some had been doing this for years. For these people, taking the preventive medication would legitimize their diagnosis, which they equated with debility and unacceptable biographies. On the other hand, the accepters had integrated their 
body failure into their lives and viewed medications as the route to maintaining their concept of self and 
biography . In between were those who had not fully accepted their con dition and the attendant medications, but 
who did not fully deny it either. On hearing about the Corbin and Strauss model, one of our peer supporter community members said:  
“This is really what it’s like. I have diabetes myself and I went through that. In the beginning you don’t want to accept it, you say I don’t believe 
it, I don’t want it. Then slowly you come around. I see it a lot in my clients. I tell them my own story and they do like that. It makes them feel like they’re not alone. You just keep at it and eventually they do get it. I think it’s a really good idea.”  Table 2. Black individuals with diabetes from the REGARDS

   Living Well with Diabetes Study Protocol | [ADDRESS_685988] results of a literature review on patient -
centered medication adherence interventions using the Institute of Medicine and Planetree organization’s 
definitions of patient -centered care/approaches.17-19 The results were striking: the voluminous literature on 
medication adhere nce and several excellent reviews revealed very few studies on patient -centered interventions, 
none using Corbin and Strauss’ framework. Conference attendees brainstormed and prioritized research gaps, including a call for studies on the trajectory of chronic medication -taking behavior and factors that can favorably 
influence that trajectory. Our study directly responds to this call from this multi- stakeholder group, including 
many patients.  
We briefed our community partners about this conference, and together we developed this proposal. They thought that hearing the stories of “people like me with problems like mine” could be a powerful influence on the trajectory of mediation taking behavior. Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory posits that behavior is influenced by 
[CONTACT_528506], a concept which underlies the power of peer 
storytelling.
20 Many people living with chronic diseases actively seek out others struggling with similar issues as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_528507].com, saying, “ I joined because I didn’t want to feel alone 
anymore. Simply put. And I knew that I could be helpful [by [CONTACT_460747]] my experience .”[ADDRESS_685989] studies were very enthusiastic about including 
videotaped storytelling in this intervention. They thought that watching the stories of how others overcame their resistance to having diabetes and how  they overcame barriers to medication adherence would be intensely 
reassuring to people struggling to do the same. Viewers of peers telling stories often develop para -social 
relationships with the storytellers, “a sense of friendship, attraction, and involvement with the person or character.”
22-24 The more engaging the story, the more listeners are transported into the story and achieve 
“homophily”, or a feeling of relatedness to the storyteller. Thus, unscripted stories told by [CONTACT_528508]- world struggles are most engaging.[ADDRESS_685990] on 
lowering blood pressure in an urban setting, but peer story telling has not been examined for diabetes or in rural 
settings.26,27 We will videotape community members with diabetes discussing their perceptions of common 
barriers to disease acceptance and medication adherence (emerging from the focus groups, see below), and to tell their own story of how they overcame them.  
 Our community partners strongly recommended that our pr ogram 
should provide education. Knowledge of diabetes and self -care is extremely 
limited in our partnering communities; 55% of Encourage participants had diabetes knowledge scores below 50% at baseline. We agree that because of the complexity of self -manag ement for diabetes, viewing stories of how 
other people overcame barriers to medication adherence (including accepting 
their disease) may be most impactful if they are integrated into an education 
program.  
 According to Adult Learning Theory, adults learn best when they 
can build on experiences from their own lives. Although education is a critical first step, community members strongly advised adding a one -on-one 
coaching component to assure that the educational content was understood and to engage participants in discussions about the stories they heard. In our past work, education was incorporated better after a discussion with a peer coach. Peer coaches, sometimes called community health workers (CHW), 
peer advisors or promotoras, are here conceptualized as people with diabetes who live in the same community and who have in -depth understanding of the 
day-to-day challenges of living with diabetes. They receive training, 
inclu ding motivational interviewing, to coach other community members with diabetes on how to improve self -
management within the context of their own lives, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528422] 2. Conceptual model of

(Figure 1). Interacting with a live peer coach is a potent experience because participants have discussions with 
someone like them, facilitating the process of internalizing the DVD content and stories they heard, and working on an action plan to overcome their barriers to medication adherence. There fore, we will add telephonic 
individualized peer coaching to the educational/storytelling DVD.  
Peer support is being more widely evaluated for diabetes,
28,[ADDRESS_685991] that peers could be powerful motivators to 
help people with self-regulation and recognize their medicines as a powerful strategy for staying as well as they can as long as they can.  
Among the Institute of Medicine’s top quartile of priority areas for comparative effectiveness research 
were interventions to reduce health disparities in diabetes using community -based approaches. In July 2013, CMS 
announced that CHW services could be covered by [CONTACT_528509], and CHW interventions are increasingly being integrated into health systems.
32-[ADDRESS_685992] barriers. Although we will study a specific population that demonstrates dramatic disparities in health outcomes (i.e., rural 
black Americans with diabetes), this intervention would serve as a model that could be adapted to other cultures, 
communities, disease states and health systems. Improved med ication adherence would improve the physiologic 
measures that are used to assess the quality of healthcare provided, and these measures include the proportion of 
diabetes patients with controlled A1c levels. Clinical trials like the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the [LOCATION_008] Prospective Diabetes Study showed that control of A1c lowers microvascular outcomes, and other clinical trials have shown that blood pressure and lipid control lower cardiovascular disease outcomes.
3,44-[ADDRESS_685993]  on healthcare performance would therefore be 
profound; as mentioned above, it could lower healthcare costs by [CONTACT_45848] $[ADDRESS_685994] Overview.  We will build on our ongoing partnerships with people living in 
Alabama’s Black Belt, learning together how to improve outcomes for individuals with diabetes. In the first year 
of the study we will conduct focus groups with people with diabetes and medicat ion nonadherence to learn more 
about their beliefs and attitudes toward living with diabetes and the medications used to treat the disease. Using this information and working within the Corbin and Strauss framework, we will collaboratively create DVDs of peer storytelling integrated into a diabetes education experience, and the peer coaching protocol, drawing on 
Social Cognitive Theory and Adult Learning Theory. We will pi[INVESTIGATOR_528423], and we will implement the randomized controlled trial (RCT)  comparing the effectiveness of the intervention with usual care. In years [ADDRESS_685995] baseline and follow -up data 6 months later. Control patients will receive 
comprehensive diabetes education on conclusion of the 6 month period. During all 3 years, we will also work 
with community coalitions in our partnering communities to obtain ongoing input, share knowledge of community resources, create a resource bank website to facilitate the peer coaches’ work, and plan for 
dissemination of the interventions .

Study Aims  
 
Improving medication adherence is one of the greatest challenges in modern medicine. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_528424], as many as half of patients with chronic diseases are not taking medications as recommended, and costs of nonadherence have been estimated at $290 billion annually. One reason for this 
persistent finding could be that interventions rarely acknowledge medications within the larger context of the 
lived experience of illness. Drawing on hundreds of patient interviews, Corbin and Strauss showed that chronic 
illness is a fundamentally destabilizing influence that forces us to confront the potential limitations of our “new”, chronically ill self. A ccepting our illness may be a crucial step in embracing medication adherence and other self -
management behaviors as ways to restore balance following this disruption. The Corbin and Strauss framework is 
not often used to develop and test interventions to i mprove medication adherence, and this is the central objective 
of this proposal.  
 
Medication adherence is especially critical in regions like rural Alabama, where residents have among the worst health outcomes in the US. Rates of cardiovascular mortality, diabetes and obesity are very high, but resources are scarce and the area’s predominately black residents have deep-seated mistrust of the healthcare system (the region 
includes Tuskegee, site of the infamous syphilis study). This project was designed in collaboration with our 
community member partners and builds on a 5- year partnership of community -engaged research on diabetes peer 
coaching interventions and our experience with peer storytelling. We will test the hypothesis that an intervention designed wi thin the Corbin and Strauss framework can improve adherence and health outcomes compared to 
usual care.  
 Our Aims are:  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Aim 1: With our community partners, using qualitative research methods, build on already developed culturally 
tailored education material to develop the medication adherence intervention. The interv ention will consist of 
educational DVDs with integrated storytelling about how community members accepted their disease and 
overcame barriers to medication adherence, plus one-on -one telephonic peer coaching. Activities include 
conducting focus groups with patients; creating the DVDs and the coaching intervention protocol; training peer 
coaches; and pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124].  
 
Aim 2: Conduct a randomized controlled trial with [ADDRESS_685996] of usual care and the intervention on medication adherence and physiologic risk factors including A1c, blood pressure and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (primary outcomes), and quality of life and self -efficacy (secondary outcomes).  
 This innov ative approach would be a major shift in how we help patients in under resourced areas living with 
chronic diseases commit to taking medications, improving health and eventually reducing health disparities.

Study Hypothesis  
 
An intervention designed within the Corbin and Strauss framework can improve adherence and health outcomes 
compared to usual care.  
 
Aim 1: Collaborative intervention development.  
 
Aim 2: Cluster RCT with [ADDRESS_685997] the hypothesis. 
 
Outcomes:  
Primary = medication adherence, A1c, blood pressure, low density lipoprotein cholesterol  
 
Secondary  = quality of life, self -efficacy  
  
  
 
 
Study Design  
 We will compare usual care to viewing an educational DVD including peer storytelling and a [ADDRESS_685998] learned that it is common for different family members to attend different practices many miles from home.

biases. Because of all the shortcomings related to assessment of adherence, we will also assess the result of 
improved adherence: better risk factor control. Three physiologic measures, A1c, blood pressure and LDL -
cholesterol make up the “A-B-C’s ” of diabetes care, which will be assessed here. The “A-B-C’s ” of diabetes are a 
central focus of diabetes education, and the intervention will address medication adherence to control all three risk factors.  
 
Secondary Outcomes  
Secondary outcomes will be health -related quality of life and self-efficacy . Quality of life  will be assessed through 
the validated Short -Form 12 (SF -12), a generic measure of health -related quality of life. We will assess diabetes-

Process Measures  
A careful assessment of intervention implementation can provide insights into which aspects of the intervention 
were particularly effective.  We will use cell phones provided by [CONTACT_528511], as well as how closely they were implemented on schedule. Additional process measures will come from the peer coach Workbooks for each participant. These will include notes from each session as well as data entered for specific activities. We provide a chapter from our current trial’s Peer Coach Workbook in the Appendix to give a general idea of how these workbooks capture process data. We also monitor 
intervention implementation on an ongoing basis through weekly teleconferences with peer coaches, and we ekly 
outreach to each peer coach individually throughout the intervention period. We provide updates on the progress 
of the study, collaboratively troubleshoot problems, and provide ongoing advice, which often stems from other peers or the community coordi nators. We also address specific concerns with the help of our community 
coordinators (e.g., finding participants whose telephone numbers have changed).  
  
Randomization  
 We will use a block randomization scheme for randomization. The units of randomizatio n are towns identified by 
[CONTACT_528512]. We will group towns by [CONTACT_48995] (small and not small) within each of the [ADDRESS_686002] participant from that town.  
Informed conse nt will be obtained from all participants. We will obtain verbal consent over the telephone at the 
time of the baseline telephone interview. Formal written informed consent will be obtained at the time of the in-home data collection visit. Participants will view a video providing information about the study with the opportunity to call a toll -free number for questions.

Intervention Participants: Living Well with Diabetes  
Peer Advisor s Recruitment  
Peer advisors are individuals who live and work in our target communities. Peer advisors are hired by [CONTACT_528513]. Peer advisors will be trained in motivational interviewing, 
basics of communication and goal setting. In addition, peer advisors will complete an [ADDRESS_686003] in being a peer advisor.  
 
After an individual is referred, UAB staff or the local community coordinator completes a Peer Advisor Candidate 
Screening Form (see Appendix B ). 
 After the screening form is completed, the principal investigator, community coordinator, study coordinator, and the UAB staff (who completed the screener) meet to review the form and discuss each candidate.  
• If the candidate is not asked to move forward in the training, the reason is documented. These individuals 
are notified in person by [CONTACT_528514].  
• If the individual is considered to be a good candidate but is unavailable for the scheduled training, 
permission is obtained from the individual to contact [CONTACT_528515].  
• Individuals who are considered a good candidate to a be peer advisor is scheduled for an upcoming training.  
 
Peer Advisor Retention  
 
As is the recruitment efforts, peer advisor retention efforts will be coordinated between UAB Birmingham -based  
staff, UAB community -based staff ( community coordinators ), and the Health and Wellness Education Center.

5. Engage peers in leading and presenting for other community activities (ex: Black Belt Institute, Coalition meetings, and as opportunities become available)  
 
Living Well with Diabetes Program Description  
Participants enrolled in the intervention arm will receive a Living Well DVD, which contains 6 video lessons that 
cover 6 content areas (1 -diabetes basics,  2-healthy eating, 3 -physical activity, 4- diabetes medications, 5 -blood 
pressure & cholesterol medications, and 6 -stress and your health), and an Activity Workbook. The participant will 
use the activity book when communicating with their peer advisors duri ng the sessions.  
 Every session, the peer and participant will discuss the participant’s medication goals. During week 1, the participant will set a medication related goal. During week 2, the participant will set a goal related to healthy 
eating. During week 3, the participant will set a goal related to exercise. The peer and participant will review the 
previous week’s goal and progress of the goal. If the participant met the goal and ready to extend the goal, the peer advisor will help the participant set a new goal. If session has a video, the peer and participant will discuss the educational content in the video.  
 
During the check -in sessions, no new topic areas are introduced. The peer advisor will review the previous week’s 
goals. Peer will review goal’s progress and assess barriers and help problem solve any barriers. New goals will be 
set if the participant is ready to extend the goal.  
 
Intervention participants also receive [ADDRESS_686004] 3 months of the program. 
The peer advisor will call monthly during the “check -in session”. During these sessions, the peer and participant 
will re view goals set, goal progress, assess barriers and help problem solve barriers. If participant is having 
trouble with their health goals during this phase, the peer and participant can decide that more contacts than 
monthly contacts are needed. For these participants, the peer advisor will provide a ‘mini -intensive’ phase, during 
which calls will be increased to weekly.  
 
The participants will be allowed to telephone the peer advisors with questions or concerns between sessions. 
During session 1, the peer advisor makes sure that the participant has the correct contact [CONTACT_6227]. The peer will let the participant know that it’s okay to call between sessions if they have questions. They will let them know that they may not be able to take the participant calls all the time, but the peer will return their calls as soon as they 
can.

Community Recruiter s. Community recruiters have been identified the community coordinators or peer advisors. 
Recruiters are asked to identify individuals in their social networks that may be interested in participating in a study to help them better care for their diabetes. Before they begin recruitment, community recruiters are given an orientation by [CONTACT_528517], study coordinator. The recruiters are provided instructions and a checklist on how to complete the information sheet.  
 
Community recruiter submits interest cards to their community coordinator w ho submits the cards to UAB staff. 
The community coordinator meets each community recruiter at minimum [ADDRESS_686009] or are asked to call the study’s phone number.  
 
During weekly calls, coordinators and study staff discuss upcoming opportunities in the communities to recruit 
participants for the study. A recruitment calendar is maintained with the event’s name, the date and time, and the 
responsible study member who is attending the event.  
   Living Well with Diabetes Study Protocol | 18 
 
Community coordinators also coordinate these following recruitment activities: radio announcements,  putting up 
flyers, newspaper ads, church announcements, and working with local primary care providers. 
 
Community coordinators or recruiter will call us with the individual’s name [CONTACT_528567]. UAB staff will add the names to the recruitm ent tracking log.  
 For every individual referred that enrolls in the study, community recruiters receive a $5.[ADDRESS_686010] an eligibility screening 
over the telephone using the “Telephone Eligibility Screening Script” in appendix D .  If individuals are eligible 
for the study and interested in enrolling in the study, he or she will be scheduled for the telephone interview.  
   Living Well with Diabetes Study Protocol | [ADDRESS_686011] the telephone intervi ews.  
 The telephone interview will begin with the interviewer reviewing the informed consent form with the participant. 
If the participant agrees to participate in the study, the interviewer will complete the baseline assessments.  
Telephone interview is included in appendix E. 
 
Interviews will be completed in the Preventive Medicine Research 510 suite. As such, the program coordinator and/or data coordinator will listen to interviews in progress. Furthermore, a random selection of interviews will be 
quali ty checked. For these interviews, the program coordinator or data coordinator will listen in to the entire 
interview.  
 
 
  Living Well with Diabetes Study Protocol | [ADDRESS_686012] private spaces available will be selected. Example locations include private rooms in community centers and church meeting rooms. UAB staff members, trained in the biometric study protocols will attend the biometric data collections. Data collectors for the study are trained and certified by [CONTACT_2792]. Training and certification for each data collection 
component are outlined in the biometric protocol. In summary, the data collector to be trained and certified, the 
following is necessary:  
1. Read the biometric protocol  (Biometric protocol included  in appendix F.) 
2. Attend Living Well training session on techniques  
3. Practice on other staff or volunteers

Data management 
Data is being entered into a Redcap Database. Validity checks and skip patterns maximize the quality of data 
entry and text entry is minimized. In -home visit data will be transcribed onto a form during the visit and faxed 
daily to the UAB research office. A tracking system will be implemented to monitor study progress using Redcap.  
 
 
Power Calculations and Sample Size  
This study is powered to detect clinically meaningful differences in changes in medication adherence, A1c, blood pressure and LDL -cholesterol between either of the intervention arms compared with the usual care arm. The 
secondary outcomes are based on surveys (disease acceptance, quality of life). To consider the clustering of 
patients within town, we used a variance inflation factor D = [1 + ρ(m – 1)], where m is the number of 
participants per community and ρ is the intra -class correlation (ICC). We conservatively estimate that we will 
have at least 80 clusters, corresponding to an average of 6 -8 participants per cluster, with ICC=0.01 and 0.05 
yielding D=1.[ADDRESS_686021] measures. To be conservative because we include new communities, we present power 
calculatio ns for ICC=0.01 -0.05. We observed 20% attrition over one year in the Encourage study and although 
attrition is likely to be lower over 6 months, we assume 20% attrition here, leaving 200 participants per group. 
Table 7 displays the detectable differences i n adherence proportions and the difference in mean changes between 
groups detectable with 80% power using 2-sided Χ
2 and t -tests with α=0.05. We used variances based on the 
Encourage sample reporting nonadherence at baseline. We hypothesize that the interv ention will result in 
improved medication adherence. Because eligibility requires low adherence at baseline, we expect low acceptance 
at baseline. Starting with low baseline values by [CONTACT_528520], as was seen in a 
storytelling intervention directed at blood pressure.27 For N=200 per group, the difference in rates of medication 
adherence treated as a binary outcome detectable with 80% power depends on the proportion observed in the intervention group. If adherence is only 20% in the intervention group, then we can detect as different rates 
among the control group of 8.8-10.1%, depending on ICC. These rates are both lower than we anticipate for the 
intervention group and considerably higher than we expect in the control group. Assuming [ADDRESS_686022] 80% power using 2-sided t-tests to detect differences of 0.[ADDRESS_686023] deviations for 
continuous outcomes. Using variance estimates from Encourage data for change in the Diabetes Distress Score, another validated psychometric instrument, this translates into detecting differences as small as 3.7 -4.4% of the 
range. Similarly, detectable differences for change in A1c are in a clinically meaningful range from 0.41 -0.48%. 
We anticipate detectable differences for systolic blood pressure of 3 -4 mmHg, and for LDL -cholesterol of 6.7-8.1 
mg/dL.  
  
Data Analysis 
The main hypothesis to be tested is that participants in the intervention group will have higher medication adherence and significantly greater improvement in A1c, blood pressure, LDL -cholesterol, and measures of 
quality of life; and fewer barriers to adherence compared to control patients. While medication adherence can be considered as a continuous variable, we will follow the literature and treat adherence as a binary outcome by 
[CONTACT_528521] -adherent if measured adherence is <80% and adherent otherwise. Therefore, 
unadjusted testing of the main hypothesis will use two -sided Χ
2 tests and statistical modeling will use logistic 
   Living Well with Diabetes Study Protocol | 24 
regression. The other primary outcomes (A1c, blood pressure, LDL -cholesterol) and the secondary study 
outcomes of physical and mental functioning, as measured by [CONTACT_20763] -12, diabetes distress, and barriers t o 
adherence are all continuous or ordinal measures. As such unadjusted hypothesis tests for these outcomes will use 
t-tests or the Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney test, as appropriate, and statistical modeling will use linear regression. 
Analysis will begin by [CONTACT_528522]; if the ICCs are 
found to be significantly non-zero with p<0.05 or with a point estimate greater than 0.01, testing of main hypotheses will use unadjusted regression models (logistic or linear, as appropriate) with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to account for clustering.  All regression models for outcomes with non- negligible ICCs will use 
GEE to account for clustering due to randomization at the town level, and will be repeated usi ng mixed models 
treating the towns as random effects with results examined for consistency.  
The primary analysis will test the hypothesis that medication adherence treated as a binary outcome will be greater in the treatment arm than the control arm at follow -up. As above, the primary unadjusted hypothesis test 
will use either a Χ
[ADDRESS_686024] or logistic regression with GEE depending on the magnitude of observed ICCs. Statistical 
significance will be judged by p<0.[ADDRESS_686025] or the coefficient for study group in regression models. 
The intervention group will be compared to the control group; further analyses will use logistic regression with GEE to model adjusting for any covariates that were imbalanced between groups at baseline, and will then proceed to examine regression models adjusted for the covariates described in Table 6. 
Analysis for A1c, blood pressure and LDL -cholesterol and the secondary outcomes will be very similar to the 
analysis of medication adherence described above. We note that we will also be able to analyze adherence as a 
continuous outcome as a secondary analysis using the following approach. For each of these continuous or ordinal measures, we will begin by [CONTACT_528523] [ADDRESS_686026]. It is possible that the interventions will result in better compliance with medication treatment, resulting in  
over-control of diabetes or blood pressure. This could result in low blood sugar or low blood pressure and 
resultant symptoms. Therefore, we will monitor potential adverse events of this nature. We will monitor symptoms of low blood sugar in both trial ar ms at the follow -up data collection point as well as at ongoing 
contacts during the 12-week intervention phase, by [CONTACT_67026]. During these contacts, symptoms of low blood sugar and low blood pressure will be assessed and reported to the investigators and to the participant’s physician. If symptoms are present, the peer coach will refer participants to their primary care provider for evaluation immediately, assisting with the telephone call if needed.  
 
Data on safety endpoints will be reviewed by a board  convened for this purpose. Quarterly reports will be 
presented to the board over the course of the trial. The board will be constituted by [ADDRESS_686027] of clinical trials and the safety of human subjects. Adverse events will be reported to the UAB IRB, 
and the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA) in accordance with regulations, by [CONTACT_978].  
 [CONTACT_528582] and project investigators, including our community team members, will have an initial organizational meeting or conference call to discuss the protocol development, review of scientific, safety and ethical issues 
 
  Living Well with Diabetes Study Protocol | [ADDRESS_686028] will be responsible for monitoring the safety and efficacy of the study, executing the data and safety 
monitoring plan, and complying with the reporting requirements. She will provide a summary of the DSM report 
to PCORI on an annual basis as part of the progress report. The report will include participant’s sociodemographic characteristics, expected versus actual recruitment rates, any quality assurance or regulatory issues that occurred during the past year, summary of adverse events, and any actions or changes with respect to 
the protocol. The DSM report to PCORI will also include, when available, the results of any efficacy data analysis 
conducted.  
 
Project investigators will be primarily res ponsible for protecting the safety of the study participants and the 
scientific credibility of the project, and the validity of the assessment of the efficacy of the interventions used in the projects. The project investigators will also formulate recommen dations relating to the selection, recruitment 
and retention of participants, their management, improving adherence to protocol -specified regimens, and the 
procedures for data management and quality control.  
 The entire project team will monitor success of recruitment, assess data integrity, and most importantly monitor 
for adverse events. Risks to study participants relate mostly to misinterpretation of what is research and what is 
usual care and loss of confidentiality. Project investigators will carefully evaluate how the study is described and 
assure that study subjects are informed not to report urgent symptoms (chest pain) through email communications. Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_528428].  
 The risks of the study are low, and thus the safety monitoring plan has been matched to the risk to subjects in this 
study. Risks to physician study participants relate mostly to misinterpretation of what is research and what is usual care and loss of confidentiality. We are encouraging physicians and their staff to increase their provision of care related to diabetes, osteoarthritis and chronic pain to be consistent with current guidelines.  However, we are not asking the physicians or their staff to provide services beyond those in standard, high- quality medical 
practices.  
 For this study, we plan interim data analysis twice annually to assess probability of stati stically significant group 
differences. We will first compare baseline data to assure adequacy of randomization. We will then conduct interim analyses that will coincide with practice data intervals, and set intervals for patient data collection for outcom es data. Prior to interim analyses, investigators will assign stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. Safety data to be included in

What is Living Well with Diabetes? 
Diabetes is a big problem in rural Alabama, especially in the Black Belt.  The Black Belt has among the 
highest rates for diabetes and diabetes complications such as heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, amputation, and eye problems. Many people who have diabetes do not take their medications every day. 
Taking your diabetes medications every day as directed by [CONTACT_528524], as long as you can.  
 
The goal of the study is to help people take care of their diabetes by [CONTACT_528525], eating healthy foods, exercising, having effective interactions with their 
healthcare team, reducing stress, and getting positive support f rom family and friends. We think that this 
program will help people with diabetes live as well as they can, as long as they can.  
 
What is a Peer Advisor? 
Peer Advisors are people who live in the Black Belt and want to help their communities. We are looking 
for people with diabetes, or people who care for someone who has diabetes. The essentials: you care 
about your community, you want to help, and you have familiarity with what it is like to live with 
diabetes day in and day out. 
 
How long would I be involved? 
The Living Well with Diabetes study will last approximately [ADDRESS_686036] to participate until the program ends? 
We are looking for people who would be willing to work with us for at least one year. 
 
What would I need to do?  
Getting Trained and Certified as a Peer Advisor 
§ Attend 2 days of in-person training, followed by a10-week telephone training. 
o Costs you nothing  
o Learn about diabetes basics, motivational interviewing, talking to the doctor , medications 
for diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol 
o Practice your new skills. NOTE: It is easier for some people to develop these skills 
than it is for others. There will be a test at the end of the [ADDRESS_686037] mastered. Unfortunately, some people may not move on 
to become Peer Advisors.

v.2015 -07-09 2 § Time Commitment for Training: 
o 2 In-person trainings: 6 hours each day, lunch will be provided 
o 10-Week Telephone Training: 2 to 4 hours each week, depending on the week 
§ 30-60 minutes listening to audio recording of the session and watching session 
video 
§ 30-60 minute telephone call with the other peer advisor candidates  
§ 30 minutes roleplaying as a client 
§ 30 minutes roleplaying as peer 
§ 30-60 minutes talking with UAB staff, providing feedback on the program, and 
completing certifications 
§ (as needed) additional practice time with the community coordinator in order to complete certification 
 
Working as a Peer Advisor 
§ Work with someone with diabetes on the phone for 5 months, one-on-one, over the phone.  
§ Time Commitment as a Peer Advisor: 
o First 2 months: talk with client on the telephone weekly (30-45 minutes per call) 
o Last 3 months: bi-weekly or monthly (10-20 minutes per call) 
o Special call before and after a doctor visit (10-15 minutes each call) 
§ Attend a weekly group call with other peer advisors  (30-45 minutes) 
§ Speak with a UAB staff member every 1-2 weeks (15-30 minutes)  
What’s in it for me? 
Peer advisors will be UAB employees. 
§ $[ADDRESS_686038] (1 day) 
§ $[ADDRESS_686039] (1 day) 
§ $[ADDRESS_686040]  
§ $150 for completing the program with each study participant. 
When does it start? The first in-person training will be July. 
The second in-person training and 10-week telephone training will start late summer/early fall.  
 I have trouble with transportation. Does that matter? 
Most of the Living Well with Diabetes program is done over the phone. We can arrange transportation 
for training. 
I only have a cell phone. Is this OK? 
You will receive an UAB cell phone for use for the study. 
How much travel will I need to do? 
You will need to attend the 2-day training in person. 
You will have to meet with your community coordinator regularly to receive / turn in study materials.

 Hello, Ms. / Mr. (__________), this is (___________) from the Living Well with Diabetes 
Program. How are you doing today?  
 We had scheduled this time to talk for about 45 minutes. Is this still a good time? 
 Great! Do you have your Activity Book and your diabetes medications in front of you? If 
needed, let client fetch the Activity Book and medications.  
 OK, let’s get started. First, let me make sure I have your contact [CONTACT_3031]. I already have 
your study phone number, but in case it runs out of battery, would you give me the number 
of two people who would know how to reach you? Verify that the information on page [ADDRESS_686042], and fill in any spaces that are empty.  
 Now, you may have questions between our sessions, so I want to make sure that you can call 
me. Do you still have my telephone number written on the front page of your Activity Book? 
 If you do call me between our sessions, I might not be able to take your call all the time, but 
I’ll call you back as soon as I can. Is that okay? Make sure the client has your number 
written on the front page of the Activity Book.  
 Great. We will be talking today for about 45 minutes. Do you feel okay with that today? 
 Wonderful. I would like to begin by [CONTACT_528527]. Let me tell you a little 
about myself. 
 Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?  
 If needed, ask questions to 
get the client to open up.  
 Write down some notes 
about things li ke their 
spouse’s name, children’s 
name s, hobbies, etc.  
 You will refer back to this 
section throughout the 
program.   
  
 
 Thank you for sharing that with me! I’m glad that we’re getting to know each other better. 
Appendix Page |  46

Refer to the FAQs for answers, or write down the question and let the client know that you will find out 
the answer and let them know next week.  
 
  If needed, suggest events such as the wedding of a grandchild, the birth of a great grandchild, travel, 
or a special reunion.  
 Try to get at least 2 to 3 long -term, meaningful events or goals that motivate them.  
 Write goals on page 3 of the Client Plan Book.  
 
  An important part of this program is looking ahead positively. As part of that, would you 
mind sharing with me some things that you are looking forward to in the future, maybe a few 
years from now? 
 Those are wonderful things to look forward to! This is the reason why I enjoy being a part of 
this program, because its goal is to help people like you and me live a full and healthy life. 
 During this program, we’ll discuss diabetes, healthy eating, exercise, and other health topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], 
providing information that can let you live longer, better.  
 Now, it’s very important that you understand that I am not a doctor or a nurse. 
 I am a health coach, and I’ve been trained to work with you to complete this program. If you 
have a question that I can’t answer, I will get the correct answer from the study doctors . 
How does that sound? Let client answer.  
 
Introducing the Living Well with Diabetes Program ------------------------------------------------  
 Great, now that we know a little bit about each other, let’s talk about the program, which is 
called, “Living Well with Diabetes.” 
 We know that diabetes is very common and has a big effect on how you live . You will be 
taking care of your diabetes for the rest of your life. 
 There are a lot of things you need to do every day to take care of yourself when you have 
diabetes, but people with diabetes can still live a full and active life. 
 So, this program will help you learn what to do to take care of yourself the best you can , 
every single day. You will learn these things through our discussions and watching videos. 
 Speaking of the videos, when you first met the research assistant for this program, she left 
with you a DVD player and program DVDs, and you watched a video on this program. 
 You will watch a video each week between our telephone sessions, so I want to make sure 
you’re comfortable with the DVD player and the DVDs. Do you have any questions about 
the DVD s or how to use the DVD player? 
 
Appendix Page |  47

If needed, remind your client that diabetes can cause blindness, stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, 
amputation, impotence, and nerve damage.   OK, another item that you will use during the program is the Activity Book, which you have 
in front of you right now. During our sessions, we will learn about ways to live well with 
diabetes, and between sessions, we’ll ask you to practice what you’ve learned. 
 The Activity Book will help you practice, so let’s turn to page 2. Here you can see some of 
the points made on the DVD. Let your client get to the page.  
 
Reviewing the DVD: Introduction to Living Well with Diabetes-----------------------------------  
 What did you think about the video for this week? Listen supportively.  
 Let’s review. We learned that diabetes is a problem with the body’s ability to handle blood 
sugar. When the blood sugar stays too high, it can cause all sorts of problems. 
 The video also talked about why some people get diabetes and others don’t, and how long it 
takes for most people to develop diabetes. What did you think about that? Let the client 
answer. 
 Another thing the video talked about was the health problems that people with diabetes may 
experience. This is shown with the figure in the middle at the bottom of page 2. Do you see 
all the arrows pointing to different parts of the body that diabetes can affect? Can you 
remember some of those problems that diabetes can cause? 
 Was any of this information new to you? Let the client answer and listen supportively.  
 There is a lot to take in, isn’t there? For many people, learning that they have diabetes can be 
overwhelming at first. 
 Do you remember the person in the video and what she went through when she first found 
out she had diabetes? What did you think about that? How did you  feel when you first 
learned you had diabetes? 
 Thanks for sharing your experience with me! Different people react differently when they’re 
first diagnosed, but most people find that living with diabetes has a big impact on their life. 
 For most people, diabetes will never go away, so you’ll need to manage your diabetes for the 
rest of your life. The good news is that t here’s a lot that you can do to keep your diabetes 
under control. 
 An important point to remember is that much of what you should do to take care of your 
diabetes is good for everyone, not just people with diabetes. So, your healthy choices will 
not only help you, but it will also help the people that you care about. Notes:  
Appendix Page |  [ADDRESS_686043] diabetes medication.  
 
 
 
 
 
 Step 2.  Ask how the client is taking the medication.  
 
 
 
 
 
  You will see that even small changes can have a big impact on your health and the health of 
the people around you. How do you feel about that? Listen supportively.  
 You are making a wonderful start by [CONTACT_528528]! We have some easy ways to help 
you remember the important parts of taking care of your diabetes.  
 OK, now find the box with “ABCDE” in it on page 2. The video also talked about the 
ABCDEs of diabetes. Do you remember what the ABCDEs stood for? If needed, remind 
client the ABCDEs: A1c, or blood sugar; blood pressure; cholesterol; diet; and exercise.  
 Do you see the 3-legged stool, on the left-hand side of page 2, that the video talked about? 
Can you remind me what those 3 parts were? If needed, remind client the 3 parts: healthy 
eating, being physically active, and taking medications as prescribed by [CONTACT_106224].  
 
 
 
Activity 1a: Checking for Side Effect or Cost Issues for Diabetes Medications -------- --------  
 As we just talked about, taking medications is an important part of living well with diabetes. 
However, many people have trouble taking their medications, and there are a lot of reasons 
why this may be. 
 I’d like to begin by [CONTACT_528529]. You told the research assistant what medicine you’re taking, and 
I’m looking at this list right now. 
 One medicine that you’re taking for your diabetes is [ read off first diabetes medication if 
there is more than one ].  
 Tell me how you take this medicine. How many times a day do you take it? How many pi[INVESTIGATOR_528435]? What are the times you take it? 
Compare what the client tells you to what is written in the Client Plan Book for dose and 
frequency (and other directions, if any). For that medication, mark down whether the client 
is taking the medicine as directed by [CONTACT_62262] “Yes” or “No” in the column headed “Taking 
as Prescribed .” If they are not taking it correctly , explain how to take it. Then, have the 
client repeat back to you, at least once, how to take it correctly. Write notes in the space as 
needed so you can remember what the problem is. You’ll go over this in future sessions. 
 Remember, once daily is usually in the morning at breakfast.  
 Twice daily is about 12 hours apart, morning and evening (for example, 8 a.m. and 8 
p.m. 
 Three times daily is about 8 hours apart (8 a.m., 4 p.m., midnight, or bedtime) .  
 
Appendix Page |  [ADDRESS_686044] diabetes medication.  
 
 
 
 
  
 Are you having any side effects from this medicine?  
Check off “Yes” or “No” next to “Side Effects.”  
If they say , “No” (they are not having a side effect), move on to Step 4. 
If they say, “Yes” (they are having a side effect), then ask:  What’s the side effect? 
 Note down any side effects in the space provided in the client plan book. Then ask: 
 Do you ever miss any doses of the medicine because of side effects ?  
 Check off “Yes” or “No” next to “Is the side effect causing missed doses?” 
 Often people can live with minor side effects, so having a side effect doesn’t mean they 
aren’t able to take the medicine. If they say, “No” (they are taking the medicine even 
though they are having a side effect), praise them and move on to Step 4. 
 If they say “Yes” (they are missing doses due to the side effect), tell them: 
 Having side effects can make it hard for us to take our medicines! But, we are going to 
make a plan to see what we can do about that. 
 Are you having any trouble affording this medicine?  
Check off “Yes” or “No” next to “Is medicine affordable?” 
If they say, “No” (they are not having trouble affording the medicine), move on to Step 5. 
If they say, “Yes” (they are having trouble affording the medicine) , then say:  
 OK, can you tell me more about this? In the client plan book, write down details about 
what makes it hard to afford this medication.  
 Many people find it hard to afford their medicines! But, you and I are going to make a 
plan to see what we can do about that. 
 
 
  Step 5. Repeat Steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 for each diabetes medication.  
 
Step 6. This step depends on what  the client has told you during Steps 1 -5 for each 
diabetes medication:  
 If the client has trouble  with side effects and/or cost, 
1. Complete  Activity 1b , “Making a Plan for Side Effects and/or Cost Issues .” 
2. Then, go to Activity [ADDRESS_686045] of the session.  
 If the client does not have trouble  with side effects and/or cost,  
1. Skip Activity 1b, “Making a Plan for Side Effects and/or Cost Issues.”  
2. Go to Activity [ADDRESS_686046] of the session.  
 
 
Appendix Page |  50
 11 
Go to page 8 of the Client Plan Book to review other barriers to taking diabetes medications.  
 Read aloud each issue marked “Very Often.”  
 If there are no issues marked “Very Often,” then read aloud each issue marked “Often.”  
 If there are no issues marked “Often,” then read aloud each issue marked “Sometimes.”  
 
For exampl e, you might say: “I see that you told the research assistant that you very often just forget to 
take your diabetes medication. Is that still true?”   
 
Activity 1b: Making a Plan for Side Effects and/or Cost Issues -----------------------------------  
 OK, you are having trouble taking your medicine because of… [repeat the side effect and/or 
cost issue from page 4 of the Client Plan Boo k]. 
 Your medicine can’t help you if you can’t take it. Let’s make a plan today to reach out to 
your doctor this week to see what can be done. The doctor can switch you to a different 
medicine, cut back the dose, or both. Go to page 5 of the Client Plan Book . Write today’s 
month, day, and year under “Date of plan.” 
 First, let’s decide who is going to call the doctor. Will you be comfortable calling by 
[CONTACT_202699]? If you’d like to have somebody else on the phone with you, who will it be? Write 
down who will be calling the doctor. 
 OK, now, when will you make this call? Write down the day and time for the call. 
 Finally, let’s rehearse what you’ll say to the doctor. Write down what the client will say to 
the doctor. Have the client repeat what they will say if they hesitate the first time.  
 OK, that sounds like we are beginning to get a plan. Let’s think about how hard this may be 
for you to do. What are some things that might make it hard for you to carry out this plan? 
Write down potential barriers.  
 What do you think you can do to overcome these things? Help clients think of possible ways 
to overcome these barriers, and write down those solutions.  
 This is great. I look forward to hearing how it went when we talk next week.  
 
 
Activity 2: Checking for Other Diabetes Medication Issues and Making a Plan ---------------  
 OK, let’s move on. 
 I’d like to go over some other issues that you mentioned to the research assistant about your 
diabetes medicines .  
 Let’s see. I see that you told the research assistant ... Follow the directions below . 
 
Appendix Page |  51
 12 
Listen supportively. Assess how receptive they are to tackling this issue. If they are not very receptive, 
move on to t he next issue until you find one  they want to work on.  Once the client decides on the issue 
they want to work on, go to page 9 in the Client Pla n Book and write down today’s date and the issue.   OK, it sounds like you’ve got some issues that prevent the medicine from working for you. 
So what should we work on first? If client hesitates, ask: How about… [pi[INVESTIGATOR_528436]]? What do you think about working on this issue? 
 OK, let’s talk about this a bit. I’d like to understand this issue better. Can you tell me more 
about this issue? Let them tell you why they have this issue, or why they feel this way. Listen 
supportively. If the issue is one that was mentioned by [CONTACT_528530], mention that. 
Or, if one of your clients has had a similar issue, mention that also. Let your client know that 
others have this issue also – they are not alone.  
 Can you think of some things that you can do to overcome this issue ? Brainstorm with them. 
Offer suggestions only after you first make sure they want suggestions. Refer to the table of 
potential solutions to each problem starting on page 27 in the Client Plan Book.  
 OK, so what would you like to try to do this week to work on this problem? If they listed 
more than one strategy, ask them to pi[INVESTIGATOR_128718]. Make sure to help client come up with a plan 
that is SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound). Write down the 
strategy in the Client Plan Book in the space provided.  
 OK, that sounds like we are beginning to get a plan. Let’s think about how hard this may be 
for you to do. What are some things that might make it hard for you to carry out this plan? 
Write down potential barriers.  
 What do you think you can do to overcome these things? Help clients think of possible ways 
to overcome these barriers, and write down those solutions.  
 This sound great ! I look forward to hearing how it went when we talk next week. 
 
 
Tracking Your Progress ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 Now, let’s look at the chart on page 4 in your Activity Book. 
On the left side  of the page , do you see the column with a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_510] a pil l bottle at the top?  
 Your homework is to check “Yes” for every day that you take 
your diabetes medications exactly the way they are 
prescribed. If you weren’t able to take your diabetes 
medications that day, then mark “No” for that day. 
 It’s important that you are honest when you fill out this chart 
every day. The goal of the program is to help you take charge 
of your diabetes, and I can’t help you if we can’t track your 
progress together. 
Appendix Page |  52
 13 
 Many people have a lot of problems with their medicines, so I need to understand when 
things are not going as planned. Do you understand? Make sure they are committed to letting 
you know if the answers are “no” on the chart.  
 Do you have any questions about what to do? Make sure client understands what to do.  
 
 Great! This homework is an important part of the program. Research has shown that tracking 
our progress by [CONTACT_528531]’re doing can help us achieve our goals. 
 You’ll monitor something every day during the program, but  what you’ll monitor will vary. 
Honesty is really important here, otherwise I can’t help you. We’ll talk a lot more about 
monitoring in each session. 
 Do you have any questions ? Give client a few seconds.  
 
 
Rules and Responsibilities --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK. Now, for this program to help you, you have to commit to it. So, please go back to page 
3 in your Activity Book. There, you’ll see rules for both of us to follow during the program. 
 Here is what I will need to do: 
 I will call you every week in the beginning, then less often to go over our sessions. 
 We will schedule our phone appointments together. If I can’t make an appointment, I’ll let 
you know, and we’ll reschedule. 
 When I call you, I’ll be on time. 
 I will help you learn, and I will listen to you. 
 Here is what you will need to do: 
 Be on time. If you can’t make it, call me, and we’ll reschedule.  
 Use the phone provided by [CONTACT_528532]. Please don’t use the phone for personal 
calls. Also, please be careful with it, because we’ll need it back at the end of the study.  
 Tell me if you’re not feeling well or if you don’t feel up to having a session. We can 
reschedule.  
 Participate actively. Try your best. This is a training program to help you help yourself, so if 
you don’t try, the program won’t help you.  
 Between our phone sessions, practice and monitor your progress and watch the videos.  
 Finally, tell me if you have any concerns.  
 Remember, this program does not include: 
 Financial support, medical advice, or medication management.

Write down where client will store the Activity Book:  
 
 
  This program is six months long. 
 Please stay on page 3 and look at the chart on the left side of the page. As you can see, I’ll be 
calling you every week for the first six weeks. After that, I’ll be calling you every other 
week for the next six weeks. Then, for the last three months, I’ll be calling you once a 
month. Each phone session will last about a half hour to forty-five minutes.  
 Since this is a research study, the researchers for this program will use the information you 
provide to see how well the program worked. They may also record some of the sessions to 
make sure everything is going on as planned.  
 However, our discussions will be kept between you, the research team, and me.  
 When the program is over, you don’t get to keep the phone, but you do get to keep the DVD 
player and the DVDs.  
 Do you have any questions about how this program works? Let client ask questions.  
 
Signing the Contract --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK. Research has shown that making a commitment to the program really helps people.  
 Are you ready to make this commitment? Give client a few seconds.  Wonderful! Then, 
please stay on page 3 in your Activity Book and look at the bottom right-hand corner . Let 
client get to the box. 
 Take  a moment to sign on the line showing that you are making a commitment to the 
program. Let client take a moment to sign on the line.  
 
Storing the Program Materials --------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, we’re almost through! Let’s take a second to figure out where you’ll keep your study 
materials between our phone sessions.  
 Remember, you’ll use your Activity Book to track your progress between our sessions.  
 So, can you think of a place to keep it where you’ll see it every day and where you can 
easily get to it to do your homework and to bring to our phone calls?  
   
Appendix Page |  54

 Try to make this date as close to 7 
days from now as possible.  
 Allow at least 7 days between 
sessions, but no more than 10 days.  Write down where client will store the DVD player:  
 
 
  Now, where do you think you can keep your DVD player? It would be good to keep it close 
to your Activity Book and in a place away from children until you’re done with the program.  
 
 
This Week’s Homework -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 Great! Let’s make sure we’re clear on this week’s homework and then schedule our next 
phone session. 
 For your homework this week, you’ll use the chart on page 4 to keep track of how you’re 
doing with taking your diabetes medicine exactly as prescribed . Check “Yes” for every day 
that you took your diabetes medicine like the doctor prescribed . On the other hand, you’ll 
check “No” if you weren’t able to take your diabetes medicine as prescribed that day. 
 You’ll tackle the issue with your diabetes medicine that we talked about earlier . I want to 
hear all about how th at went when we talk next week. 
 Finally, you’ll watch the Healthy Eating video and we’ll be talking about that at our next 
phone session, too. Do you have any questions? Let the client answer.  
 
Scheduling Next Session ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, when would you like to talk next week? 
 OK, please write down the date and time in the box at the bottom of page 4. 
 I look forward to speaking next week and hearing how things went!

Say hello and make sure the client is 
still okay with speaking for about a half 
hour to forty minutes today.  
 If they did not watch the DVD, tell them to watch it 
now, and you’ll call back in a half hour.   
Greeting -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
 Great, do you have your Activity Book handy? 
If not, let them get the Activity Book before going on.  
 OK, please turn to page 5 in the Activity Book. 
Today, we’ll review what we learned last week and talk about how your homework went. 
 We’ll also learn about healthy eating and diabetes. To do this, we’ll review the video on 
Healthy Eating and talk about some simple rules that you can follow to help you eat healthy. 
 Finally, we’ll talk about your homework for this week. 
 Can I ask if you’ve watch ed the DVD? 
 
 
Review Last Week’s Session -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, let’s review what we learned last time. Please turn to page 5 in your Activity Book. 
 Please look at the review section of the page. We talked about diabetes, which means the 
body can’t handle blood sugar. 
 When the body can’t use blood sugar normally, there’s too much sugar in the blood stream. 
That’s uncontrolled diabetes, and it makes you tired, thirsty, and run to the bathroom a lot. 
 Over many years, diabetes can cause complications like heart attack, stroke, kidney 
problems like dialysis, blindness, nerve damage, and amputations. Uncontrolled diabetes 
increases your chances of getting these things, sometimes called “diabetes complications.” 
 You can see all the organs that diabetes affects in the cartoon in the middle of the page. 
 We also learned that for most people, diabetes is an illness that develops over many years. 
That’s the pi[INVESTIGATOR_528438], where diabetes didn’t happen 
until after many years of eating unhealthy and being too inactive. 
 For most people, even if they eat right, exercise, and take their medicines, diabetes won’t go 
away. But there’s a lot you can do to control diabetes and decrease your chances of getting 
the problems listed in the review section of the page.  
 That means that you’ll probably need to take care of your diabetes for the rest of your life. 
 Taking care of your diabetes means eating healthy, getting enough exercise, taking 
medications, and going to the doctor regularly for check- ups to keep the ABCDEs of 
diabetes in check. Do you remember what that stands for? Point out the box on the bottom of 
page 5.  
 You can remember what you need to do every day at home to take care of your diabetes by 
[CONTACT_528533] 3-legged stool on the bottom right of page 5. Can you remind me what the 3-
legged stool is? Let client answer. If needed, tell client the 3 legs: eating healthy, being 
physically active, and taking your medications as prescribed.  
Appendix Page |  57
 18 
 We learned that we need to do all 3 things in order for us to live better, longer, with diabetes. 
 Does that sound right? Let client answer. Did you have any questions? Let client answer.   
Appendix Page |  58
 19 
Let client answer. If needed, remind clie nt that  
 Half of the plate should be fruits and vegetables.  
 A quarter of the plate should be protein, like red meat, pork, fish, chicken, and beans.  
 The last quarter of the plate should be starchy foods, like brown rice, pasta, potatoes, corn, and peas.  Review DVD: Healthy Eating ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 Great! Let’s move on and talk about the DVD you watched 
this week. How did you like it? Let the client answer and listen 
supportively.  
 OK, please turn to page 6 in your Activity Book. Let’s 
review some of the things we saw on the DVD. Let the client get to 
the page.  
 So, we learned why eating healthy is so important. First, 
eating healthy provides your body with the nutrients you need to 
be active and healthy. 
 Eating healthy also helps you to better manage your weight and to control diabetes.  
 A healthy diet can make us feel good now and in the future, because eating healthy helps 
keep the blood sugar down to keep you feeling well, and it also decreases the chances of 
diabetes complications, like heart attack, stroke, dialysis, and amputations.  
 In the video, several people spoke about how eating healthy makes them feel, like how it 
affects their mood and their ability to do the things they need to do and to enjoy life. Have 
you noticed this yourself? Do you think healthy eating makes a difference in how you feel 
day-to-day? How about what you are able to do on a daily basis? 
 Now, the DVD shared three simple rules to help you eat healthy every day. Do you 
remember any of the three rules? Let them tell you any or all of the 3 rules.  
 OK, let’s review.  Rule Number One was to avoid second helpi[INVESTIGATOR_14839].  We can remember this 
rule by [CONTACT_528534], “One and done.”  
 Rule Number Two was to use the healthy eating plate as a guide to eating the right 
balance of foods, and to not overload the plate.  You can remember this rule by [CONTACT_528534], 
“Respect the border,” so that you can see the pretty border of the plate and not overload. 
 Can you remember how we should divide up the plate? 
 An important part of this rule is not to overload your healthy plate, right? You want to be 
able to see the border of the plate – respect that border. 
Notes:  
Appendix Page |  59
 20 
 Last but not least, Rule Number Three was to eat less fried foods and fats, and drink 
fewer sugar-sweetened beverages.  You can remember this rule by [CONTACT_528534], “Be sweet on 
yourself.”  Avoiding unhealthy foods is definitely being sweet on yourself. 
 How do these three rules sound? Let the client answer and listen supportively.  
 These rules can not only help you eat healthy and live well, but they also can help your 
family and friends , too! If they don’t already have diabetes, eating healthy can help prevent 
diabetes. 
 As the DVD said, people with diabetes don’t need to fix themselves “special” meals while 
having to fix something different for the rest of the family. 
 Do you remember the person in the video that talked about how she felt when she thought 
she had to cook differently for herself, while the rest of the family ate what they wanted? 
Have you experienced that yourself or known anybody that has gone through that? 
 That person also talked about how her cooking and eating healthy ended up helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528439], like how her husband’s blood pressure went down from eating healthier. What 
about you? Have you known anyone that has gotten healthier because their family or friends 
changed how they ate? 
 Thanks for sharing your thoughts about this! Like the video said, these three rules—one and 
done, respec t the border, and be sweet on yourself—will help the entire  family eat healthy 
and live well. How do you feel about that? Let the client answer and listen supportively.  
 Great! Now that we know the three rules are good for the whole family, we can use these 
three rules to guide us as we shop and prepare foods for healthy meals and snacks. 
 As you know, it can be challenging to shop and prepare healthy foods, because we have to 
drive far to get to the grocery store, and fresh fruits and vegetables can cost a lot and spoil 
quickly. 
 Plus, we are often very busy taking care of our families and friends, working, and 
volunteering. This can make it hard to find the time to take care of our diabetes. Notes:

 We are going to work together to figure out what works best for you and your family so that 
you can eat healthy and live as well as you can, as long as you can. 
 Also, you might enjoy reading the information on page 8 of your activity book, which shares 
some tips about how you can shop at your local Dollar Store or other convenience store and 
make healthier choices. 
 Great! Do you have any questions so far? Let client answer.  
 
 
 
Activity 1: Assess Your Healthy Eating: What did I eat in the past day? -------------------------  
 OK, let’s check out what you’re eating and talk about what you could do to eat a little 
healthier. 
 It’s hard to make a change if we don’t know what we’re doing well and where we could use 
a little help. 
 So, please think about what you ate yesterday. Go to page 12 in the Client Plan Book and fill 
in the chart by [CONTACT_528535].

 Let’s begin with breakfast. 
 Did you have more than one helpi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a meat or a starch?  Remember: starches are 
“white foods” like potatoes, bread, bagels, rice, grits, pasta, cereal. If yes, then ask: How 
many helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528440]? Write down the number over 1; for example, if they had 2 helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528441], that’s one second helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528442] [ADDRESS_686047].  
 Did you have any fruit? If yes, then ask:  How many servings?  Write down the number of 
fruits under breakfast.  
 Did you have any vegetables ? If yes, then ask:  How many servings? 
 Did you drink any sugar-sweetened drinks? If they sweeten coffee with sugar, that’s a 
sugar -sweetened drink. Soda pop is sugar-sweetened. Fruit juice counts as sugar-
sweetened. If yes, then ask:  How many? 
 Did you have any dessert? If yes, then ask:  How many servings? 
 Did you have any fried food? If yes, then ask:  How many servings? 
 Now, let’s talk about lunch. 
 Did you have more than one helpi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a meat or a starch? Note: a sandwich is usually 
two pi[INVESTIGATOR_528443]; the second pi[INVESTIGATOR_528444] a second helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]!  
 Did you have any fruit? If yes, then ask:  How many servings? 
 Did you have any vegetables ? If yes, then ask:  How many servings? 
 Did you drink any sugar-sweetened drinks? If yes, then ask:  How many? 
 Did you have any dessert? If yes, then ask:  How many? 
 Did you have any fried food? If yes, then ask:  How many servings? 
 OK, let’s now talk about dinner. 
 Did you have more than one helpi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a meat or a starch? 
 Did you have any fruit? If yes, then ask:  How many servings? 
 Did you have any vegetables ? If yes, then ask:  How many servings? 
 Did you drink any sugar-sweetened drinks? If yes, then ask:  How many? 
 Did you have any dessert? If yes, then ask:  How many? 
 Did you have any fried food? If yes, then ask:  How many servings? 
 Finally, think about your snacks. 
 Did you have more than one helpi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a meat or a starch? 
 Did you have any fruit? If yes, then ask:  How many servings? 
 Did you have any vegetables ? If yes, then ask:  How many servings? 
 Did you drink any sugar-sweetened drinks? If yes, then ask:  How many? 
 Did you have any dessert? If yes, then ask:  How many? 
 Did you have any fried food? If yes, then ask:  How many servings?

 Add across in each row and enter the total in the “Total” column.  
o For example, if they had [ADDRESS_686048], no second helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528445], 1 second help ing at dinner, and no second helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528446], that’s 1 + 1 = 2.  
o You would enter a “2” in the “Total” box for “Second helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528447].”  
 Repeat for each line (number of fruits, number of vegetables, number of sugar -sweetened drinks, 
number of de sserts, number of fried foods).  
 Repeat for each line (number of fruits, number of vegetables, number of sugar -sweetened drinks, 
number of desserts, number of fried foods).  
 Keep your voice neutral and don’t make the client feel bad.   OK, that’s great. Now, give me a minute to total this up. 
 OK, now let’s see how healthy your eating was. Please turn to page 6 in your Activity Book, 
and write down these numbers in the chart under where it says “Me”. Do you see that? 
 OK, under “Me” in the line that says “Number of second helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528447]”, please 
write down … say the number in the Total box for “Number of second helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528448]” from the chart on page 12 in the Client Plan Book.  
 
 
This is what they see in their Activity Book: 
          ME     Goal  
Number of second helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528449]   0 
Number of fruits   3-4 
Number of vegetables   3-4 
Number of sugar -sweetened 
drinks   0 
Number of desserts   0-1 
Number of servings of fried foods   0

Listen supportively. Use “OARS” (open -ended questions, affirmations, reflective listening, summaries) 
to help them recognize areas in need of improvement.  
 Go to page 13 of the Client Plan Book and write today’s date next to “ Date of plan.”  
 Help the client  set a specific, measurable, achievable , relevant, and time -bound goal.  
 Once a plan has been made, summarize it. For example, a summary could go like this:  
“OK, let me make sure I got this right. So, you noticed that you aren’t eating enough fruits and 
vegetables, you’re taking too many second helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528450] , eating too much fried food, and you 
drink a lot of sugar -sweetened drinks. This week, you would like to mak e a change by [CONTACT_528536] -sweetened dr inks. Rather than drinking sweet tea at dinner, you’re going to switch to 
water. You feel that you’re going to be able to do this during weeknights to start with, so you are 
going to follow your goal Monday through Friday, starting tonight. Did I get that right”?  
 Once the client confirms the plan, write it down in the space provided in the Client Plan Book. Be 
sure to write down specific meal(s) and days during which client will follow the goal.  
 You will encourage the client to also write down their goal in  the box to the right of the chart on 
page 6 of their Activity Book.  Activity 2: Set a SMART Goal to Improve Healthy Eating -----------------------------------------  
 OK, did you write down those numbers? Why don’t you read them back to me? Let the 
client confirm.  What are your thoughts as you look at this? 
 OK, so what would you like to do over the next week to make a change? 
 
 OK, so that you remember, why don’t you jot down this plan in the space on page 6 in the 
box marked “My Goal Is”. Do you see that? 
 Ok, let’s think about how hard this may be for you to do. It’s pretty challenging to change 
what we eat. What are some things that might make it hard for you to carry out this plan? 
Write down potential barriers in the space in the Client Plan Book.  
 OK, what do you think you can do to overcome these things ? Help clients think of possible 
solutions to these barriers, and write down those solutions in the space in the Client Plan 
Book.  
 This is great! You’ll monitor your progress every day this week, and I can’t wait to hear how 
this went for you. Please turn to page 7 and look at the column marked “Eat Healthy?”. Each 
day that you keep to your plan, you’ll mark off “yes”. If you were not able to keep your plan, 
you’ll mark off “no.” Is that clear? Make sure they understand what to do.  
 
 
 
 
Appendix Page |  64
 25 
Continue with Days 2 through 7 before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_528451].  
 For each day, check “Yes” or “No.”  
 For each day, ask client if they took their diabetes medicine,  
even if their blood sugar was normal. Praise them for every  
“yes”  
 If they didn’t take their diabetes medicine every day,  
discuss what happened. Avoid being judgmental.  
 Reassure client that taking medicine every day  
the way the doctor prescrib ed is hard fo r a lot of people.  
Tell them that you will work together to develop  a plan  
 for this week to help them  take the medicine every day.  
 Write down what happened in the box below.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Reassure them that taking medicine every day as prescribed by [CONTACT_528537] a lot of people. 
Tell them that you’ll work together to develop a plan for this week that will help them take their 
diabetes medicine every day.  Notes:  Review of Last Week’s Homework ----------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, let’s now go over your homework from last week. Can you turn to page 4 ? Let the client 
get to the page.  
 For homework, you monitored whether you took all your diabetes medication each day. I’d 
like to go over it, day by [CONTACT_4475], and see how it went.  
 Let’s start with Day 1. Did you take all of your diabetes medication just like the doctor 
prescribed on Day 1?   
 
 Now, last week, we talked about… [go to Client Plan Book on page [ADDRESS_686049]; if not, go to page [ADDRESS_686050] out of your medicines. 
Let’s review how things went. 
 To overcome this issue, you decided to… [read out loud the medication-taking plan from 
last week] . 
 You thought that it might be hard for you to carry out this plan, because… [read 
potential barrier s]. 
 To go around the problem, you decided to… [read how client decided to go around 
potential barri ers].

Notes:  
 If the ir plan worked and last week’s issue is resolved,  encourage them  to tackle a new issue  this 
week.  If you try hard and they don’t want to tackle another issue and they took their medicine each 
day, praise them again for their success and tell them you’d like to discuss tackling a new issue next 
time.  
 If they are ready to tackle a new issue, g o back to page [ADDRESS_686051].  
 If there are remaining issues related to side effects or cost, then help the client make a plan to 
address them this week.  
 If there are no remaining issues related to side effects or cost, go to page [ADDRESS_686052] of statement s that are marked “Very Often,” or “Often” if there are no 
“Very Often” statements to address, and “Sometimes” if there are n o “Often” statements to 
address . 
 Help them decide which  new goal they would like to tackle  for the coming week.  
 Summarize to confirm their new goal. For example, you could say:  
“OK, let me see if I got this straight. Last week, you … [repeat last week’s goal]. You did well 
with that, so  this week, you’ll … [repeat this week ’s goal]. Did I get that right?”  
 
 If they were not able to meet their medication goal, then let them stick to the sam e goal.  
 Be supportive, and l et them know you’ll revisit  the goal next week to see how it went this time.  
 Strategize what they will  do differently this week to succeed. Make it a SMART goal.  
 
 Record this week’s strategy in the Client Plan Book.  
 If the strategy addresses side effects/and or cost, record this week’s strategy on page 5, “Plan for 
Diabetes Medication Side Effects and/or Cost”.  
 If the strategy addresses other barriers besides side effects or cost, then record this week’s 
strategy on page 9, “Plan for Other Diabetes Medication Barriers”.  
 
 
 
   So, how did this go? Listen supportively and take notes in the box below. If things did not go 
well, discuss what to do differently this week. If the problem is solved, praise them!  
 OK, so let’s talk about what you’d like to do for the next week. 
 
 OK, let’s think about how hard this may be to do. What are some things that might make it 
hard for you to carry out this plan? Write down barriers in the Client Plan Book.  
 OK, what do you think you can do to overcome these things? Help clients think of possible 
solutions to these barriers, and write down those solutions in the Client Plan Book.  
 OK, let’s review that. It looks like you’ll… repeat the medication goal. Then, review 
potential barriers and how client will go around those barriers. Let client confirm.  
 I look forward to hearing how this plan worked when we talk next time!

 Try to make this date as close  to 7 
days from now as possible.  
 Allow at least 7 days between 
sessions, but no more than 10 days . This Week’s Homework -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 Now, let’s go over your homework for the coming week. Please turn to page 7 in your 
Activity Book. There, you’ll see the chart where you’ll monitor your progress until our next 
session. 
 First, you’re going to continue tracking how you’re 
doing with your diabetes medication. 
 Every day, under the column with the pi[INVESTIGATOR_510] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_160663], you’re going to mark “Yes” if you took all of 
your diabetes medication that day. If you weren’t 
able to take all of your diabetes medication, then 
you’ll mark “No” for that day.  
 Remember to be honest. I can’t help you if I don’t 
know where you need help. 
 You’ll carry out the plan we discussed that will help you get the most out of your medicines. 
 You’re also going to mark down whether you succeeded with your healthy eating plan . 
Remember, you were going to …Repeat the healthy eating goal you developed today and 
recorded on page 13 of the Client Plan Book.  
 So, under the column with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_528452], you’re going to mark “Yes” if you were able 
to follow your healthy eating plan as we discussed. 
 Finally, you’ll watch the DVD on Getting Exercise, which we’ll talk about next time. 
 Do you have any questions about what to do? Make sure client knows what to do.  
 
Scheduling the next session------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Say hello and make sure the client 
is still okay with speaking for about 
a half hour to forty minutes today.  
 
 If they did not watch the DVD, tell them to watch it 
now, and you’ll call back in a  half hour.  Greeting -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
 Great, do you have your Activity Book handy? 
If not, let them get the Activity Book before going on.  
 OK, please turn to page 9. Today, we’ll review what we 
learned last week and talk about how your homework went. 
 We’ll also learn about physical activity. To do this, we’ll review the DVD on physical 
activity and talk about some simple rules that you can follow to help you add physical 
activity to your life. Finally, we’ll talk about your homework for this week. 
 Can I ask if you’ve watched the DVD? 
 
Review Last Week’s Session -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, let’s review what we learned last time. Please stay on page 9 in your Activity Book. 
 We talked about healthy eating, which is one of the legs of the three-legged stool. 
 Eating healthy will not only help you get the nutrients you need to be active and healthy, but 
it also will help you better manage your weight and your diabetes. 
 We learned 3 rules to help us eat healthy – can you name [CONTACT_476]? Let the client answer. If 
needed, remind the client that the 3 rules of healthy eating are “One and Done,” “Respect 
the Border,” and “Be Sweet on Yourself.” Be sure to review what each of these rules means.  
 We also went over how things were going taking your medicines, and made a plan for how 
you’ll try to get the most out of your medicines to Live Well with Diabetes. 
 Does that sound right? Let the client answer. Did you have any questions? Let the client 
answer. 
 
 
Review DVD: Physical Activity -------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 Great! Let’s move on and talk about the DVD you watched this week. How did you like it? 
Let the client answer and listen supportively.  
 OK, let’s turn to page 10 in your Activity Book and review some of the things we saw on the 
DVD. 
 Now, just as there were 3 rules for healthy eating, the DVD talked about 3 rules for physical 
activity. 
 The first rule is, “Be Smart, Exercise Your Heart.”  This rule will help you to remember 
the many benefits of physical activity. 
 Physical activity can help us feel less tired and more energetic; improve our mood and 
reduce stress and anxiety; help us think better as we age; and help us live better longer by 
[CONTACT_528538].

Notes:  
Notes:   In the video for the past week, there were several people that talked about how exercise 
helps them in a variety of ways. Can you remember some of those things? (If needed, remind 
client of some of the benefits that people mentioned: exercise lifts their spi[INVESTIGATOR_2120], exercise helps 
them sleep better, and exercise helps get stiffness and pain out of their joints.)  What did you 
think about that? Have you or anyone you know benefited from exercise like this? 
 Exercise has lots of benefits beyond helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528453], which is what many people 
think exercise is only good for. The video mentioned that it’s actually not common for 
people to lose weight when they begin an exercise program. 
 Now, the combination of diet and exercise can lead to weight loss, but remember that 
exercise has many other benefits! It’s a critical part of living a long and healthy life. 
 For instance, do you remember the pastor from the video talking about how he thinks about 
his body like a car? Can you remember how he described the heart? How did that strike you? 
 Now, the second rule is, “Walk Down Your Blood Sugar.”  This rule will help you to 
remember that walking and other kinds of physical activity can help lower your blood sugar. 
 The DVD told you that adults should try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate-level exercise 
on 5 or more days per week. If you’re exercising at a moderate level, you can talk but you 
can’t sing.  
 If you are not used to getting any exercise, work up to the 30 minutes gradually. It’s fine to 
start small, for example, just 10 minutes a day, and add 5 or 10 minutes every couple of 
weeks. 
 Since exercise lowers your blood sugar, a great time to take a brisk walk is after a meal, 
when your blood sugar goes up. If you monitor your blood sugar, try testing your blood 
sugar before and after you exercise to see the difference. 
 OK, last but not least, our third rule is, “Sitting is the New Smoking.”  This rule will help 
you remember that it is very unhealthy to sit too long. 
 So, try to incorporate 2 minutes of light activity every hour. The DVD discussed several 
strategies for doing this. For example, if you’re watching TV, you can get up during the 
commercials and walk briskly around the house until your show comes back on. 
 How do these three rules sound? Let the client answer and listen supportively.  
Appendix Page |  70
 31 
 Go to page 16 in the Client Plan Book and write today’s date next to “Date of plan.”  
 Next to “Current exercise,” write down what they are doing currently for exercise and how much.  
 Include minutes per day and level of activity.  
 For example, if they are doing 5 minutes of slow walking, write that down.  
 Be reassuring and supportive if they don’t do any exercise now, or if they do very little.   
 
  What’s nice about these rules is that they can not only help you exercise and live well, but 
they also can help your family and friends , too! 
 As the DVD said, getting at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, 5 days per 
week, is recommended for all adults, so you can improve the health of your family and 
friends by [CONTACT_528539]. 
 You also don’t need to get fancy equipment or go anywhere special to exercise. Our goal is 
to help you be physically active in a way that is manageable  for you. 
 So if walking around your neighborhood works best for you, your schedule, and your 
budget, that’s fine! Walking is a great way to reach your physical activity goal. 
 Also, you might enjoy the chair exercises video and the walk in place video. These videos 
show how we can do chair exercises if we are in too much pain to walk very much, or how 
we can walk in place indoors if we’re not able to go outside. 
 Great! Do you have any questions so far? Let the client answer.  
 
Activity 1: Set a SMART Goal for Exercise -----------------------------------------------------------  
 Great! Now that we’ve discussed how important exercise is, let’s come up with a plan that 
will help you get enough exercise. 
 Some people with diabetes find it hard to walk because of painful joints, amputations, or 
other limitations. However, that doesn’t mean that you can’t exercise. One option is to 
exercise in a chair. Like walking, chair exercises can improve your health. Also, if your 
joints are hurting, chair exercises can improve your pain. 
 There is a “Learn More” video that shows you how to do chair exercises when you are 
unable to be on your feet for a long time. You can do the chair exercises with the DVD 
running, so you might want to give it a try. 
 Now, let’s think about your own exercise program. Remember, we want to work toward a 
total of [ADDRESS_686053] 5 days of the week. 
 Let’s start with what you do right now to get exercise. Can you tell me what kind of activity 
you are doing now? Many people do no exercise at all, so, if that’s you, don’t be shy. 
 OK, thanks for sharing that with me! Now, look at the the top right-hand corner of page 10, 
and you will see a clock and a small calendar. 
 This will help you remember that that the recommended amount of exercise is [ADDRESS_686054] 5 days per week. So what do you think? 
Appendix Page |  71
 32 
 In the Client Plan Book on page 16, help client set a SMART goal that includes these details:  
 Next to “What client wi ll do this week,” write down what they’ll do, for example, walking, or 
chair exercises.  
 Next to “Where client will do it,” write down where the client will exercise.  
 Next to “When during the day,” write down at what time in the day the client will exercise, for 
example, after dinner or 7pm.  
 Next to “How many minutes each time,” write down how many minutes of exercise they will do.  
 Next to “Which days of the week,” write down specific days the client will exercise.  
 For clients that don’t exercise at all right now, start with [ADDRESS_686055] the 30 minutes , 5 days  a week  goal!  
 
 
 
 
Note: if the client has not done some of the homew ork [ADDRESS_686056], the investigators may want to help 
the person to succeed. Let them know that someone from the research tea m will be in touch.  
 Call the research team within 24 hours and let them know what is happening.  
 UAB staff  will brief you on the conversation and the plan so that you can reinforce it next week.   What would you like to do to improve? What kind of activity do you want to do this coming 
week? 
 OK, let’s think about how hard this may be to do. What are some things that might make it 
hard for you to carry out this plan? Write down barriers.  
 OK, what do you think you can do to overcome these things? Help clients think of possible 
solutions to these barriers, and write down those solutions.  
 OK, let’s review that. It looks like you’ll… repeat the type of exercise, how many minutes on 
which days, when and where they’ll do it, and with whom, if they plan to exercise with 
another person. Then, review potential barriers and how client will go around those 
barriers. Let the client confirm.  
 
 Great, I look forward to hearing how this went when we talk next week!  
 
Review of Last Week’s Homework ----------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, now let’s go over your homework from last week. 
 Can you turn to page 7 in your Activity Book? Let the client get to the page.  
 
 
 
 
 
Appendix Page |  72
 33 
Notes:  Continue with Days 2 through 7 before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_528451].  
 For each day, check “Yes” or “No.”  
 For each day, ask client if they took their diabetes medicine,  
even if their blood sugar was normal. Praise them for every  
“yes”  
 If they didn’t take their diabetes medicine every day,  
discuss what happened. Avoid being judgmental.  
 Reassure client that taking medicine every day  
the way the doctor prescrib ed is hard for a lot of people.  
Tell them that you will work together to develop  a plan  
 for this week to help them  take the  medicine every day.  
 Write down what happened in the box below.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Reassure them that taking medicine every day as prescribed by [CONTACT_528537] a lot of people. 
Tell them that you’ll work together to develop a plan for this week that will help them take their 
diabetes medicine every day.  Notes:  Homework #1: Medications 
 OK, let’s review how things went with your diabetes medication. Let’s start with Day 1. Did 
you take all of your diabetes medication on Day 1?  Don’t review healthy eating at this point.  
 Now, I’d like to follow up on the plan that we made last week to help you get the most out of 
your medications by [CONTACT_528540].  
 Let me see, last week, the issue you wanted to work on was… [go to Client Plan Book on 
page [ADDRESS_686057]; if not, go to page [ADDRESS_686058] week] . 
 To overcome this issue, you decided to… [read out loud the medication-taking plan from 
last week] . 
 You thought that it might be hard for you to carry out this plan, because… [read 
potential barriers] . 
 To go around the problem, you decided to… [read how client decided to go around 
potential barriers] . 
 Now, how did it go? Listen supportively and take notes in the box below. Assess how well 
this worked. If it did not work well, talk about why not. If it did go well, praise them.  
Appendix Page |  73
 34 
 If the ir plan worked and last week’s issue is resolved,  encourage  them  to tackle a new issue  this 
week.  If you try hard and they don’t want to tackle another issue and they took their medicine each 
day, praise them and let them know you’ll be talking again about this next time.  
 If they are willing to work on something new, g o back to the Client Plan Book on page 4, the 
diabetes medication list.  
 If there are remaining issues related to side effects or cost, then help the client make a plan to 
address them this week.  
 If there are no remaining issues related to side effect s or cost, turn to page [ADDRESS_686059] of statement s that are marked “Very Often,” or “Often” if there 
are no “Very Often” statements to address, or “Sometimes” if there are n o “Often” statements to 
address . 
 Help them dec ide which new goal they would like to add for the coming week.  
 Summarize to confirm their new goal. For example, you could say:  
“OK, let me see if I got this straight. Last week, you … [repeat last week’s goal]. You did well 
with that, so  this week, you’ll  … [repeat this week ’s goal]. Did I get that right?”  
 
 If they were not able to meet their medication goal, then let them stick to the sam e goal.  
 Be supportive, and l et them know you’ll revisit  the goal next week to see how it went this time.  
 Strategize what they will do differently this week to succeed. Make it a SMART goal.  
 
 Record this week’s strategy in the Client Plan Book.  
 If the strategy addresses side effects/and or cost, record this week’s strategy on the page, “Plan 
for Diabetes Medication Side Effects and/or Cost,” in the Client Plan Book.  
 If the strategy addresses other barriers besides side effects or cost, then record this week’s 
strategy on the page, “Plan for Other Diabetes Medication Barriers,” in the Client Plan Book.  
 
 
 
   OK, so what would you like to do over the next week to help you get the most out of your 
medications?  
 
 OK, let’s think about how hard this may be to do. What are some things that might make it 
hard for you to carry out this plan? Write down barriers.  
 OK, what do you think you can do to overcome these things? Help clients think of possible 
solutions to these barriers, and write down those solutions.  
 OK, let’s review that. It looks like you’ll… repeat the medication goal. Then, review 
potential barriers and how the client will go around those barriers. Let the client confirm.  
 I look forward to hearing how this plan worked when we talk next time!

with that, so now you’d like to add another healthy eating goal. So, this week, you’ll … 
[repeat this week’s goal]. Did I get that right?”  
 If they were not able to meet their healthy eating goal,  
 Let client  stick to the same eating goal, but be sure to modify the plan if needed.  
 Go to page 13 in the Client Plan Book and write down det ails in the space provided. Be sure to 
include all the information necessary for the goal.  
 Be supportive, but do remind  your client that you’ll revisit  the goal next week to see how it went 
this time.  Homework #2: Healthy Eating 
 OK, great! Let’s talk about your plans for healthier eating. 
How did things go with your diet? Listen supportively.  
 Let’s review what you wanted to do to eat healthier. Last 
week, you decided to…  [go to Client Plan Book page [ADDRESS_686060] week].  
 How did that go on Day 1?  For each day, check “yes” or 
“no” for the Healthy Eating column .  
 
 
 
 OK, so let’s talk about this.  
 
 OK, let’s think about how hard this may be to do. What are some things that might make it 
hard for you to carry out this plan? Write down potential barriers.  
 OK, what do you think you can do to overcome these things? Help clients think of possible 
solutions to these barriers, and write down those solutions.

Say hello and make sure the client 
is still okay with speaking for about 
a half hour to forty minutes today.  
 
 If they did not watch the DVD, tell them to watch it 
now, and you’ll call back in a half hour.  
Notes:  Greeting -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
 Great, do you have your Activity Book handy? 
If not, let them get the Activity Book before going on.  
 Please turn to page 12 . Today, we’ll review what we 
learned last week, review your homework, and learn about diabetes medications. 
 We’ll review what you learned on the DVD, and we’ll get new homework for this week. 
 OK, let’s get started. Can I ask if you’ve 
watched the DVD? 
 
Review Last Week’s Session -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, let’s review what we learned last time. Please stay on page 12. 
 We talked about the importance of physical activity, which is one of the legs of the three-
legged stool. Remember – if you ignore any one of the three legs, it all comes tumbling 
down! 
 We learned 3 rules to help us be physically active – can you name [CONTACT_476]? Let client answer. 
If needed, remind client that the 3 rules of physical activity are “Be Smart, Exercise Your 
Heart,” “Walk Down Your Blood Sugar,” and “Sitting is the New Smoking.”  
 We also checked on how you were doing with your medicines, and with healthy eating. You 
are now actively working on all 3 legs of that stool. 
 Does that sound right? Let client answer. Did you have any questions? Let client answer.  
 
Review DVD: Diabetes Medications -------------------------------------------------------------------  
 Great! Let’s move on and talk about the DVD you watched this week. How did you like it? 
Let the client answer and listen supportively.  
 Let’s review some of the things we saw on the DVD. Please stay on page 12 . Let the client 
get to the p age. 
 During this week’s video and the first video you watched for this program, you heard some 
people talk about diabetes medications and how they felt when they were first given 
medications for their diabetes. What did you think about that? Listen to their response. Bring 
out that many people feel reluctant to take medications after finding out that they have 
diabetes. Emphasize how common it is that people in your communities feel this way at first 
and don’t realize how important medicines are for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_528455] . However, it’s never 
too late to get the benefits of medicines.  
Appendix Page |  78
 39 
Notes:  Notes:   One of the important points made on the video is that the medications are really important 
for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_528456], but they aren’t perfect.  
 We learned that diabetes progresses even on medications. This is why you may eventually 
need a second or third medication even if you’re doing everything right. 
 Also, we learned that diabetes progresses much more quickly off medications, shortening 
your life and increasing risks for disabling conditions like stroke, dialysis, heart attack, and 
amputations. 
 These complications can be prevented or delayed with medications, diet, and exercise. 
 There are many types of diabetes medications available, so you should be able to get on a 
medication that both controls your sugar and lets you feel well. 
 Side effects can be a problem, but you should discuss with your doctor before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. In 
the video, do you remember what happened with the person that had trouble with her 
medications at first? If needed, remind client that she had trouble with her sugar going too 
low and experiencing stomach upset. However, instead of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_528457], she worked with her doctor to find the right medicine for her.  
 Finally, the video mentioned how generic medications work as well as brand name [CONTACT_8422], 
but generics can be more affordable. 
 Did you have any questions about what you learned? If the client has questions that weren’t 
covered in the video, write down the questions and ask the research team. Tell the client 
you’ll ask the doctors in the study and let them know the answer next time. Or, coach the 
client to ask their doctor their questions. Write down questions in the box below.  
 
 
Activity 1: How Medications Can Help Me Live Better, Longer-----------------------------------  
 Now, let’s review some of the things we talked about at our first session. Please turn to page 
13. Go to page 3 in the Client Plan Book and look at what the client told you were some of 
their hopes for the future.  
Appendix Page |  [ADDRESS_686061] helped.  
You may also want to discuss the video clips of Black Belt residents talking about their diabetes and 
medicines.  
2. Be supportive and don’t criticize. Encourage them to see th e value of medicine.  
3. If they don’t want to, be  supportive and move on. There will be more opportunities to talk about this 
later in the program.   If the client didn’t share anything during the first session, encourage them to share something now. 
Future plans could include something they want to do in retirement, watching a grandchild grow up, 
attending a family reunion, etc.  
 If needed, ask them about their loved ones, especially grandchildren or great grandchildren. Suggest 
something they may want to look forward to in the future, for example, see their great grandchild get 
married. Add what client shares with you to what you already wrote on page 3 in the Client Plan Book .  You told me that you wanted to. .. read one of their long term goals from page 3.  Is that still 
important to you?  Listen supportively.  
 After watching the video, now you know how diabetes medications are supposed to work for 
you. How do you think taking the medicines will let you… [restate their long-term goal]?  
 So, taking yo ur diabetes medication will help you live well now and live well in the future, 
so that you can do the things we just talked about.  
 Your diabetes medication will help you have less symptoms of high blood sugar. If you stop 
your medicine, within a few days, you may feel very tired and thirsty, and you may run to 
the bathroom all the time.  
 On top of you feeling better, day to day, your diabetes medication will help you reach your 
long-term, future plans so that you’re well enough to do what you want to do and to enjoy it.  
 If you stop your diabetes medication, in the long run, you’ll have higher risks for stroke, 
heart attack, dialysis, and amputation.  
 Many people who have these complications can’t live alone anymore.  
 Independence is so important for us as we get older. It’s great to know there are so many 
things we can do to improve our chances for remaining independent as long as possible.  
 Do you know anyone who lost their independence because of diabetes, or because of a 
diabetes complication like stroke, amputation, or dialysis? Encourage them to tell you about 
a family member or acquaintance who lost their independence. If they don’t know anyone, 
share a personal story of someone you know who lost their independence. Relate this 
person’s story to the client’s own future plans. Ask them how they would feel if this 
happened to them. Ask them whether they’d like to avoid this if possible.  
 If you make sure you are on medicines that you can afford and that agree with you, and you 
take them every day, you’ll feel better now and you’ll increase your chances of being well 
for… restate the long-term goal again. How does that sound? Listen supportively.

Activity 2: Are M y Diabetes Medications Working for Me? ---------------------------------------  
 OK, let’s be sure that your medicines are working for you. 
 The way we tell whether they’re working is your A1c number. From your report card that 
you got at the start of the study, I see that your A1c number was… read out loud the A1c 
number on page 2 in the Client Plan Book.  
 On page 13, write in your A1c number into the box.  
 Can you tell me what that number means? Encourage them to tell you how to interpret the 
number and reinforce what it means. Use the chart below. This is also in their Activity Book.  
 OK, so your number is… read the category of A1c number , which means it’s… read “what 
it means”.  
 Let’s talk about what this means in terms of what you should do.  
 
A1c number  What it means  What you should do  
Less than [ADDRESS_686062] more medicine.  
 If the number is less than 7, you want to do whatever you can to keep it there. Can you tell 
me what that is? Discuss that this is healthy eating, exercise, and taking the medicines as the 
doctor prescribed.  
 When it’s over 7, it’s time for action. That’s a sign that you may need to make more efforts 
to eat healthier, exercise more, or get better at taking the medicines.  
 Sometimes you are doing all of those things well, but the number is still high. Do you know 
what that means? Explain that this happens as diabetes progresses, and some people may 
have uncontrolled diabetes even if they are doing everything right. It may be time to increase 
a dose or get another medicine added – both requiring a talk with the doctor.  
Appendix Page |  81
 42 
If you decided together that they should reach out to the doctor, discuss in detail how the client will do 
that. 
 Many people won’t want to call the doctor themselves and may need help. Discuss who in their family 
can make the call if they don’t feel comfortable.  
 Write down the date of the call and what they’ll say when the client calls the doctor in the box below.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Reassure them that taking medicine every day as prescribed by [CONTACT_528537] a lot of people. 
Tell them that you’ll work together to develop a plan for this week that will help them take their 
diabetes medicine every day.  Note: if the client has not done some of the homew ork [ADDRESS_686063], the investigators may want to help 
the person to succeed. Let them know that someone from the research team will be in touch.  
 Call the research team within 24 hours and let them know what is happening.  
 UAB staff  will brief you on the conversation and the plan so that you can reinforce it next week.   
If you make a plan to reach out to the doctor, call back the day after the planned call by [CONTACT_528541]/family member to check how things went. If needed, plan together what to do next if 
things did not go well (for example, if the client never called, or if they never got to talk to the 
doctor). They may need to make an appointment, and may need help figuring out how to get 
there. Help them with this. 
 
Review of Last Week’s Homework ----------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, now let’s go over your homework from last week. 
 Can you turn back to page 11 in your Activity Book? Let client get to the page.

Appendix Page |  83
 44 
 If the ir plan worked and last week’s issue is resolved,  encourage them  to tackle a new issue  this 
week.  If you try hard and they do n’t want to tackle another issue and they took their medicine each 
day: 
 Go back to the Client Plan Book.  
 If there are remaining issues related to side effects or cost, then help the client make a plan to 
address them this week.  
 If there are no remaining issues related to side effects or cost, l ook at the list of statements  on 
Page 8  that are marked “Very Often” (or “Often” if there are no “Very Often” statements to 
address, or “Sometimes” if there are no “Often” statements to address).  
 Help them decide wh ich new goal they would like to add for the coming week.  
 Summarize to confirm their new goal. For example, you could say:  
“OK, let me see if I got this straight. Last week, you … [repeat last week’s goal]. You did well 
with that, so  this week, you’ll … [re peat this week ’s goal]. Did I get that right?”

 If the strategy addresses side effects/and or cost, record this week’s strategy on the page, “Client 
Plan for Diabetes Medication Side Effects and/or Cost,” in the Client Plan Book.  
 If the strategy addresses other barriers besides side effects or cost, then record this week’s 
strategy on the page, “Client Plan for Other Diabetes Medication Barriers,” in the Client Plan 
Book.  
 
 
 
   OK, so what would you like to do over the next week to help you get the most out of your 
medications?  
 
 OK, let’s think about how hard this may be to do. What are some things that might make it 
hard for you to carry out this plan? Write down barriers.  
 OK, what do you think you can do to overcome these things? 
Help clients think of possible solutions to these barriers, and 
write down those solutions.  
 OK, let’s review that. It looks like you’ll… repeat the 
medications goal. Then, review potential barriers and how 
client will go around those barriers. Let client confirm.  
 I look forward to hearing how this plan worked when we talk 
next time!  
 
 
Homework #2: Healthy Eating  
 OK, now, let’s talk about your healthy eating. 
 Were you able to eat healthy on Day 1?  For each day, check 
Appendix Page |  84

 Let client  stick to the same eating goal, but be sure to modify the plan if needed.  
 Go to page “Plan for Healthy Eating” in the Client Plan Book and write down details in the 
space provided. Be sure to include all the information necessary for the goal.  
 Be supportive, but do remind  your client that you’ll revisit  the goal next week to see how it went 
this time.  “yes” or “no” for the Healthy Eating column.  
 Great! Now, I’d like to talk about the plan that we made last week to help you eat healthy 
every day. Last week, you planned to… [go to Client Plan Book and read out loud the 
healthy eating goal the client chose to work on last week] . 
 You thought that it might be hard for you to carry out this plan, because… [read potential 
barriers] . 
 To go around the problem, you decided to… [read how client decided to go around potential 
barriers] .  
 Now, how did it go? If they were able to meet their goal, praise them profusely! However, if 
things did not go as planned, provide encouragement and tell them that you’ll come up with 
new strategies together, if new plans are needed.  
 OK, what would you like to do this week in terms of healthy eating?  
 
 OK, let’s think about how hard this may be to do. What are some things that might make it 
hard for you to carry out this plan? Write down potential barriers.

 How many minutes of exercise were you able to get on Day 1? For 
each day, write number of minutes under the exercise column .  
 OK, now, I’d like to talk about the plan that we made last week to

new strategies together, if new plans are needed.  
 Thanks for sharing that with me! We know that the recommendation is to get [ADDRESS_686064] 5 days each week, but we need to build up to that gradually.  
 OK, what would you like to do this week in terms of physical activity?  
 
 OK, let’s think about how hard this may be to do. What are some things that might make it 
hard for you to carry out this plan? Write down potential barriers.  
 OK, what do you think you can do to overcome these things? Help clients think of possible 
solutions to these barriers, and write down those solutions.  
 Great, I look forward to hearing how this plan worked when we talk next time!

Say hello and make sure the client 
is still okay with speaking for about 
a half hour to forty minutes today.  
 
 If they did not watch the DVD, tell them to watch it 
now, and you’ll call back in a half hour.  Greeting -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
 Great, do you have your Activity Book handy? 
If not, let them get the Activity Book before going on.  
 Please turn to page 14. Today, we’ll review what we 
learned last week, learn about blood pressure and cholesterol medications, and review what 
you learned on the DVD. 
 We’ll also review your homework, and we’ll get new homework for this week. 
 OK, let’s get started. Can I ask if you’ve 
watched the DVD? 
 
Review Last Week’s Session -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, let’s review what we learned last time. Please stay on page 14. 
 We talked about the importance of taking our diabetes medications, which is one of the legs 
of the three-legged stool.  
 Can you remember some of the ways diabetes medications can help you? Let client answer. 
If needed, remind client that diabetes medications work to keep down their blood sugar; 
high blood sugar will make them feel bad - tired, going to the bathroom too often, and 
feeling thirsty all the time. Along with diet and exercise, medications also prevent or delay 
complications of diabetes like stroke, dialysis, heart attack, and amputations.  
 OK, we learned that medications aren’t perfect, and that your diabetes may continue to 
progress, even when you’re on medications. If you don’t take the medicine, your diabetes 
will progress faster. That’s why you may need a second or third medication, even if you’re 
doing everything right.  
 Diabetes medications may give you side effects, but many people won’t get any side effects. 
 There are many types of medications available, so you and your doctor should be able to 
find a medication that controls your sugar and lets you feel well. 
 We also checked on how you were doing with your diabetes medicines and with healthy 
eating and exercise. In the past two weeks, you have been working on all 3 legs of the stool! 
That’s great! 
 Does that sound right? Let client answer. Did you have any questions? Let client answer.  
 
Review DVD: Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Medications ---------------------------------------  
 OK. Let’s move on and talk about the DVD you watched this week. How did you like it? Let 
the client answer and listen supportively.  
 Let’s review some of the things we saw on the DVD. Please turn to page 15 . Let the client 
get to the page.  
 You heard someone on the video talk about blood pressure medications. What did you think 
about that? Listen to their response. Bring out that she didn’t really understand how 
Appendix Page |  89
 50 
Notes:  important blood pressure medicines were until well after she experienced a complication. 
Emphasize that high blood pressure is very common in your communities, and that the 
consequences of not taking care of high blood pressure can be very serious.  
 There are some important numbers to remember. Do you remember the numbers that mean 
you have high blood pressure? 140 over 90 or higher is high blood pressure.  
 If you don’t get it under control, meaning lower than 140 over 90, high blood pressure can 
lead to serious complications. Do you remember any of these complications?  Complications 
include stroke, heart attack, dialysis, blindness.  
 One of the important points made on the video is that because it has no symptoms, high 
blood pressure can be especially dangerous. You may feel OK right up until you have a 
stroke. It’s the “silent killer.” 
 Sometimes it can feel like the doctor is experimenting because they often switch the 
medications and change the dose. But this isn’t experimenting, right? Many blood pressure 
medicines work better in some people than others, so it may take a while to get it right.   
 Just like for diabetes, there are many different medications available to treat high blood 
pressure, so you should be able to get on a medication that both controls your blood pressure 
and lets you feel well. 
 Some people do get side effects. Do you remember what the advice was if you get a side 
effect? Let them tell you. It should be “talk to the doctor.” You shouldn’t just stop.  
 Now, the video also talked about high cholesterol. We learned that high cholesterol causes 
health problems. Do you remember what those were? Answer: stroke and heart attack.   
 OK, here’s a trick question. Do you remember what symptoms high cholesterol causes? 
Answer: no symptoms with high cholesterol.  
 What about the “bad cholesterol”, do you remember what that was? Answer: LDL 
cholesterol. OK, do you remember the good number you want to be below? Answer: 100.  
 The main medicine for high cholesterol is a statin. Do you remember how many people feel 
well and have no side effects on statins? Answer: 3 of 4.  
 Finally, the video mentioned that, for both blood pressure and cholesterol medications, the 
generic versions work as well as the brand name [CONTACT_8422], but generics can be more affordable.  
 Did you have any questions about what you learned? If the client has questions that weren’t 
covered in the video, write down the questions and ask the research team. Tell the client 
you’ll ask the doctors in the study and let them know the answer next time. Or, coach the 
client to ask their doctor their questions. Write down questions in the box below.

 Encourage clients to think of other things they’d like  to do in the future . Plans could include something 
they want to do in retirement, watching a grandchild grow up, attending a family reunion, etc.  
 If needed, ask them about their loved ones, especially grandchildren or great grandchildren. Suggest 
somethin g they may want to look forward to in the future, for example, see their great grandchild get 
married. If client mentions anything new, add to what you already wrote on page 3.  Activity 1: How Medications Can Help Me Live Better, Longer-----------------------------------  
 Now, let’s review some of the things we talked about at our first session as well as last time. 
Please turn to page 16. Here you see some events or occasions that many people look 
forward to. Can you tell me what you see? There are pi[INVESTIGATOR_67915] a 50th anniversary, a 
wedding, graduation, a baby, and a family reunion.  
 Go to page [ADDRESS_686065] time we talked, you told me that it was important for you to…  read 
their long term goals from page 3.  Since we talked, did you think of any other things that 
you’re looking forward to doing in the future? Listen supportively.  
 You learned a lot about how high blood pressure and high cholesterol affect the body, and 
how the medicines help to slow these changes down.  
 Now that you’ve watched the videos on medicines for diabetes, blood pressure, and 
cholesterol, you know how these medicines are supposed to work for you. How do you think 
taking the medicines will let you… [repeat their long-term goals]? Listen supportively.  
 If you stop your medication, in the long run, you’ll have higher risks for complications like 
stroke, heart attack, dialysis, and amputation. Do you know anyone with any of these 
conditions?  Listen supportively.  
 Many people who have these complications can’t live alone anymore. During our last 
session, we talked a little about people we know that lost their independence because of 
these complications.  
 Since we talked, did you think of anyone else you know who can’t live alone anymore 
because of stroke, heart problems, dialysis or amputation? Encourage client to talk about 
another family member or acquaintance who lost their independence. If they don’t know 
anyone else, repeat or share another personal story of someone you know who lost their 
independence. Relate this person’s story to the client’s own future plans. Ask how they 
would feel if this happened to them. Ask whether they’d like to avoid this if possible.  
 Independence is so important for us as we get older. A lot of people don’t realize that taking 
these medicines for diabetes, high blood pressure, or cholesterol let us stay independent 
longer. Did you know that’s what the medicines are for? Listen supportively.  
  
Appendix Page |  91
 52 
 If they are skeptical about the value of the medicines, talk about others like them whom you have 
helped.  You may also want to discuss video clips of Black Belt residents talking about their medicines.  
 Be supportive and don’t criticize. Encourage them to see th e value of medicine.  
 If they don’t want to, be supportive and move on.   If you make sure you are on medicines that you can afford and that agree with you, and you 
take them every day, you’ll increase your chances of being well for… repeat their future 
goal. You’ll also be able to live independently for longer. What do you think about that?  
 
Activity 2: How is My Blood Pressure? ----------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, let’s talk about your blood pressure. From your report card that you got at the start of 
the study, I see that your blood pressure was… read out loud the blood pressure number 
from the client report card on page 2 in the Client Plan Book. 
 OK, if you don’t mind, on page 16 of your Activity Book, write in your blood pressure 
numbers into the box. Do you see the box in the middle of the left-hand side of the page? 
First, write... read out the first  number.  Then, write... read out the second number.  
 Can you tell me what these numbers mean? Is your blood pressure normal? Is it high? Let 
the client answer. If needed, remind client that 120/80 is normal, less than 140/90 is the 
goal, and 140/90 or higher is high.  
If the blood pressure is lower than 140/90, say:  
 Your blood pressure is in a great range. You’ll want to keep an eye on it because it 
may go up at some point in the future as you get older . Now, let’s stay on page 16 
and talk about your cholesterol . Go to ACTIVITY 3 on page 54 of your manual.  
If the blood p ressure is 140/90 or higher: 
 OK, so your blood pressure is high. Did you know that over half of people with high 
blood pressure don’t have it under control? So you are not alone.  
 If you and your doctor can get it under control, under 140/90, it will help you meet 
your goals and stay independent.  
 Let’s go over your blood pressure medicines and make sure you are not having 
problems. Go to page 19 in the Client Plan Book to see if they’re taking any 
medications for blood pressure.  
If there are no blood pressure medicines listed, go to #1 on page 53 in your manual.  
If there are blood pressure medicines listed, go over each medicine: how they’re 
taking their medicine, whether they’re experiencing side effects that are causing them 
to miss doses, and whether they’re able to afford their medicine.  
1) If they are making mistakes in how they are taking it, or they are missing 
doses because of side effects or cost, go to #2 on page 53 in your manual.    
2) If they are taking it correctly and aren’t missing doses because of side effects 
or cost, go to #3 on page 54 in your manual . 
Appendix Page |  92

1) IF NOT TAKING ANY BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICINES: 
 It looks like you are not taking any medicines for blood pressure, and it’s high. As you 
learned from the video, it’s very common to get high blood pressure as we get older.  
 Have you ever been told your pressure is high before? If this is the first time the pressure 
is high, suggest they get it rechecked at the pharmacy over the next week. Check back at 
the next session.  
If they have been told the pressure was high in the past, suggest they talk to the doctor 
about it. Go to page 20 in the Client Plan Book and help client come up with a plan 
on how to reach out to the doctor: who is calling the doctor, when they are calling, 
what the client will say, potential barrier for carrying out the plan, and how they will 
get around the barrier. Write down plan in the Client Plan Book and check back at the 
next session.  
When finished, go to ACTIVITY 3 on page 54 of your manual . 
 
 
2) IF ON MEDICINES BUT NOT TAKING CORRECTLY:  
If they are missing doses because of side effects or cost, be supportive and tell them this 
happens to a lot of people.  
Go to page 20 in the Client Plan Book and help client come up with plan on how to 
reach out to the doctor: who is calling the doctor, when they are calling, what they 
will say, potential barrier to the plan, and how to get around the barrier. Write down 
the plan in the Client Plan Book and check back at the next session.   
If they are not having issues with side effects or cost but still not taking it correctly, 
supportively correct any mistakes. Tell them a lot of people find this confusing.  
Go to page [ADDRESS_686066] or at the doctor’s office with the nurse. Write down the plan in the 
Client Plan Book and check back at the next session.  
 OK, let’s see how that goes. I look forward to hearing about whether the blood pressure is 
better now that you are taking it like the doctor prescribed.  
Note: here are some common mistakes:  
 Twice daily means morning and evening (not 2 doses in the morning)  
 Many people skip doses of water pi[INVESTIGATOR_528459]. If they do this, make sure 
they take it when they come back – don’t skip a whole day.  
 Some people only take them every other day.  
When finished, go to ACTIVITY 3 on page 54 of your manual .

3) IF ON MEDICINES AND THEY ARE TAKING CORRECTLY:  
 It looks like you are taking the medicines just like the doctor prescribed, but the medicine 
may not be enough. What would you like to do about your blood pressure to get it under 
control? Listen to what they would like to do. If they don’t know what to do, suggest they 
talk to the doctor. If they agree to talk to the doctor, go to page 22 in the Client Plan 
Book and help client come up with plan on how to reach out to the doctor. Decide:  
1. Who is calling the doctor, and when 
2. What the client will say to the doctor 
3. Whether the client needs a friend or family member with them to make sure their 
questions get answered; if yes, then who 
4. Possible barriers to the plan, and what client will do to go around barriers 
Check back at the next session.  
Note: About 1 in 5 people may need 4 or even 5 blood pressure medicines to get the blood 
pressure below 140/90, and some can’t get it down below 140/90. However, if the blood 
pressure is a lot lower than it used to be, that means the medicine is helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a lot and 
they are lowering risks, so you can praise them for getting it down, even if it’s not below 
140/90.  
When finished, go to ACTIVITY 3 on page 54 of your manual.  
 
Activity 3: How is My Cholesterol? ---------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, let’s make sure that your cholesterol is where it needs to be.  
 From your report card that you got at the start of the study, I see that your LDL cholesterol, 
or the “bad” cholesterol, was… read out loud the LDL cholesterol number from page 2 in 
the Client Plan Book.  
 OK, if you don’t mind, on page 16 of your Activity Book, write in your cholesterol number 
into the box at the bottom left-hand corner of the page.  
 Can you tell me what this number means? Is it OK or is it high? Let the client answer. If 
needed, remind client that less than 100 is the goal, whereas 100 or higher is high.  
If the LDL cholesterol is less than 100, say:  
 Your cholesterol is in a great range. Congratulations! Now, we can review your 
homework from last week. Please turn to page [ADDRESS_686067] Week’s Homework on page 57 of your manual. 
 
 
 
Appendix Page |  94
 55 
If the LDL cholesterol is 100 or higher: 
 OK, so your cholesterol is high. Did you know that most people with diabetes have 
high cholesterol? So, you are not alone.  
 If you and your doctor can get it under control, which is under 100, it will help you 
meet your goals and stay independent as long as possible.  
 Let’s go over your cholesterol medicines and make sure you are not having any 
problems. Go to page 23 in the Client Plan Book to see if they’re taking any 
medications for cholesterol.  
If there are no cholesterol medicines listed, go to #1 on page 55 in your manual. 
If there are cholesterol medicines listed, go over each medicine: how they’re taking 
their medicine, whether they’re experiencing side effects that are causing them to 
miss doses, and whether they’re able to afford their medicine. 
1) If they are making mistakes in how they are taking it, or they are missing 
doses because of side effects or cost, go to #2 on page 56 in your manual.  
2) If they are taking it correctly and aren’t missing doses because of side effects 
or cost, go to #3 on page 56 in your manual.   
 
1) IF NOT TAKING ANY CHOLESTEROL MEDICINES: 
 It looks like you are not taking any medicines for cholesterol and it’s high. As I already 
told you, it’s very common for people with diabetes to have high cholesterol. The two 
sort of go hand in hand.  
 Have you ever been told your cholesterol is high before? Listen supportively.  
Note: Some people may have tried a medicine and it didn’t agree with them, or they 
could not afford it, or they just didn’t feel like taking it. 
If your client mentions any of these things, discuss what they learned about 
cholesterol on the video.  
Tell them about others in the community just like them who used to feel the way they 
do, but who now take cholesterol medicine.  
Remind them that most people feel normal when on cholesterol medicine.  
If they seem open to it, suggest making a plan to reach out to their doctor. Go to page 
24 in the Client Plan Book and help client client come up with a plan: who is calling 
the doctor, when they are calling, what the client will say, potential barrier for 
carrying out the plan, and how they will get around the barrier. Write down the plan 
in the Client Plan Book and check back at the next session.  
When finished, go to Review of Last Week’s Homework on page 57 of your manual.

2) IF ON MEDICINE BUT NOT TAKING CORRECTLY:  
If they are missing doses because of side effects or cost, be supportive and tell them this 
happens to a lot of people. 
Go to page 24 in the Client Plan Book and help client come up with plan on how to 
reach out to the doctor: who is calling the doctor, when they are calling, what they 
will say, potential barrier to the plan, and how to get around the barrier. Write down 
the plan in the Client Plan Book and check back at the next session. 
If they are not having issues with side effects or cost but still not taking it correctly, 
supportively correct any mistakes. Tell them a lot of people find this confusing. 
Go to page 25 in the Client Plan Book and help client make a plan for taking it 
correctly. Ask client to get cholesterol rechecked at the doctor’s office after about a 
month. They can wait until their next regularly scheduled visit, which may not be for 
several months. Write down the plan and check back at the next session. 
 OK, let’s see how that goes. I look forward to hearing about how it went and whether 
you got any side effects now that you will be taking the medicine every day like the 
doctor prescribed. If you do, we’ll make a plan for how to handle that. How does that 
sound? Let the client answer.  
When finished, go to Review of Last Week’s Homework on page 57 of your manual.  
 
 
3) IF ON MEDICINES AND THEY ARE TAKING CORRECTLY: 
 It looks like you are taking the medicines just like the doctor prescribed, but the medicine 
may not be enough. What would you like to do about your cholesterol to get it under 
control? Listen to what they would like to do. If they don’t know what to do, suggest they 
talk to the doctor. If they agree, go to page 26 in the Client Plan Book and help client 
come up with plan on how to reach out to the doctor. Decide: 
1. Who is calling the doctor, and when 
2. What the client will say to the doctor 
3. Whether the client needs a friend or family member with them to make sure 
their questions get answered; if yes, then decide who will call with them. 
4. Possible barriers to the plan, and what client will do to go around barriers 
Check back at the next session.

Note: if the client has not done some of the homew ork [ADDRESS_686069], the investigators may want to help 
the person to succeed. Let them know that someone from the research team will be in touch.  
 Call the research team within 24 hours and let them know what is happening.  
 UAB staff  will brief you on the conversation and the plan so that you can reinforce it next week.  
Continue with Days 2 through  7 before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_528451].  
 For each day, check “Yes” or “No.”  
 For each day, ask client if they took their diabetes medicine,  
even if their blood sugar was normal. Praise them for every  
“yes.”  
 If they didn’t take their diabetes medicine every day,  
discuss what happened. Avoid being judgmental.  
 Reassure client that taking medicine every day  
the way the doctor prescrib ed is hard for a lot of people.  
Tell them that you will work together to develop  a plan  
 for this week to help them  take the medicine every  day. 
 Write down what happened in the box below.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Notes:  Review of Last Week’s Homework ----------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, now let’s go over your homework from last week. 
 Can you turn to page 13 in your Activity Book? Let client get to the page.   
 Were you able to complete the homework? 
 
Homework #1: Medications 
 OK, let’s start with your medicines, beginning with Day 1. 
 Did you take all of your diabetes medication on Day 1? 
 Now, I’d like to follow up on the plan that we made last week to help you get the most out of 
your diabetes medications by [CONTACT_528540].  
Appendix Page |  97
 58 
Notes:  
 If the ir plan worked and last week’s issue is resolved,  encourage them  to tackle a new issue  this 
week.  If you try hard and they don’t want to tackle another issue and they took their medicine each 
day, try this:  
 Go back to the Client Plan Book.  
 If there are remaining issues related to side effects or cost, then help the client make a plan to 
address them this week.  
 If there are no remaining issues related to side effects or cost, l ook at the list of statements that 
are marked “Very Often” (or “Often” if there are no “V ery Often” statements to address, and 
“Sometimes” if there are no “Often” statements to address).  
 Help them decide which new goal they would like to add for the coming week.  
 Summarize to confirm their new goal. For example, you could say:  
“OK, let me see i f I got this straight. Last week, you … [repeat last week’s goal]. You did well 
with that, so  this week, you’ll … [repeat this week ’s goal]. Did I get that right?”  
 
 If they were not able to meet their medication goal, then let them stick to the sam e goal.  
 Be supportive, and l et them know you’ll revisit  the goal next week to see how it went this time.  
 Strategize what they will do differently this week to succeed. Make it a SMART goal.  
 
 Record this week’s strategy in the Client Plan Book.  
 If the strategy addresses side effects/and or cost, record this week’s strategy on the page, “Plan 
for Diabetes Medication Side Effects and/or Cost,” in the Client Plan Book.  
 If the strategy addresses other barriers besides side effects or cost, then record this week’s 
strategy on the page, “Plan for Other Diabetes Medication Barriers,” in the Client Plan Book.  
 
 
 
   Last week, the issue you wanted to work on was… [go to Client Plan Book and read out 
loud the diabetes medication issue that they chose to work on last week] . 
 To overcome this issue, you decided to… [read out loud the medication-taking plan from 
last week] . 
 You thought that it might be hard for you to carry out this plan, because… [read 
potential barriers] . 
 To go around the problem, you decided to… [read how client decided to go around 
potential barriers] . 
 Now, how did it go? Listen supportively and take notes in the box below. Assess how well 
this worked. If it did not work well, talk about why not. If it did go well, praise them.  
 OK, so what would you like to do over the next week to help you get the most out of your 
medications?  
  
Appendix Page |  98
 59 
 
 OK, let’s think about how hard this may be to do. What are some things that might make it 
hard for you to carry out this plan? Write down barriers.  
 OK, what do you think you can do to overcome these things? Help clients think of possible 
solutions to these barriers, and write down those solutions.  
 OK, let’s review that. It looks like you’ll… repeat the medications goal. Then, review 
potential barriers and how client will go around those barriers. Let client confirm.  
 I look forward to hearing how this plan worked when we talk next time!  
 
 
Homework #2: Healthy Eating  
 OK, now, let’s go over what happened with your healthy 
eating. 
 So, were you able to eat healthy on Day 1?  For each day, 
check “yes” or “no” for the Healthy Eating column.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Let’s review what you wanted to do to eat healthier. Last week, you decided to…  [go to 
Client Plan Book and read the healthy eating goal that they chose to work on last week].  
 You thought that it might be hard for you to carry out this plan, because… [read potential 
barriers] . 
 To go around the problem, you decided to… [read how client decided to go around potential 
barriers] .  
 Now, how did it go? If they were able to meet their goal, praise them profusely! However, if 
things did not go as planned, provide encouragement and tell them that you’ll come up with 
new strategies together, if new plans are needed.

 If they  met their healthy eating goal,  
 Explore if they are ready to add another goal this  week. Ask them to turn to page 9  in their 
Activity Book and look at the chart. Help them decide which new goal they would like to add for 
the coming week.  
 Go to the Client Plan Book and write down details in the space provided. Be sure to include all 
the information necessary for the goal.

[repeat this week’s goal]. Did I get that right?”  
 If they were not able to meet their healthy eating goal,  
 Let client  stick to the same eating goal, but be sure to modify the plan if needed.  
 Go to the Client Plan Book and write down details in the space provided. Be sure to include all 
the information necessary for the goal.  
 Be supportive, but do remind  your client that you’ll revisit  the goal next week to see how it went 
this time.   OK, what would you like to do this week in terms of healthy eating?  
 
 OK, let’s think about how hard this may be to do. What are some things that might make it 
hard for you to carry out this plan? Write down potential barriers.  
 OK, what do you think you can do to overcome these things? Help clients think of possible 
solutions to these barriers, and write down those solutions.  
 Great, I look forward to hearing how this plan worked when we talk next time!  
 
 
Homework #3: Physical Activity 
 OK, now, let’s go over how you did with exercise. 
 How much exercise were you able to get on Day 1? For each 
day, write number of minutes under the exercise column.

exercise. Last week, you decided to…  [go to Client Plan Book 
and read the exercise goal that they chose to work on last 
week].  
 You thought that it might be hard for you to carry out this plan, 
because… [read potential barriers] .

 If they met their goal and were doing less than 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week, then e xplore if 
they are ready to add another 5 minutes.  
 If they are not comfortable advancing the goal, let them stick to the same goal, but supportively 
warn that you’ll be discussing this again next week and remind them that the eventual goal is 30 
minutes per day.  
 Write the goal for this week in the space provided in the Client Plan Book.  
 If they were not able to meet their goal,  
 Let client stick to the same goal, but be sure to modify the plan if needed.  
 Summarize. For example, say: OK, let me see if I got this straight. Last week, you [repeat last week’s 
goal], and you did pretty well with that, so now you’d like to add another 5 minutes ea ch day. That 
means that, this week, you’d like to [repeat this week’s goal]. Did I get that right?   Now, how did it go? If they were able to meet their goal, praise them profusely! However, if 
things did not go as planned, provide encouragement and tell them that you’ll come up with 
new strategies together, if new plans are needed.  
 Thanks for sharing that with me! We know that the recommendation is to get [ADDRESS_686070] 5 days each week, but we need to build up to that gradually.  
 OK, what would you like to do this week in terms of physical activity?  
 
 OK, let’s think about how hard this may be to do. What are some things that might make it 
hard for you to carry out this plan? Write down potential barriers.  
 OK, what do you think you can do to overcome these things? Help clients think of possible 
solutions to these barriers, and write down those solutions.  
 OK, let’s review that. It looks like you’ll… repeat the type of exercise, how many minutes on 
which days, when and where they’ll do it, and with whom, if they plan to exercise with 
another person. Then, review potential barriers and how client will go around those 
barriers. Let the client confirm.  
 Great, I look forward to hearing how this plan worked when we talk next time!

Say hello and make sure the client 
is still okay with speaking for about 
a half hour to forty minutes today.  
 
 If they did not watch the DVD, tell them to watch it 
now, and you’ll call back in  a half hour.  Greeting -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
 Great, do you have your Activity Book handy? 
If not, let them get the Activity Book before going on.  
 Please turn to page 17. Today, we’ll review what we 
learned last week, review the DVD, and learn more about stress and your health, including 
some specific strategies you can take to reduce stress. 
 We’ll also review your homework and what you learned on the DVD, and we’ll get new 
homework for two weeks.  
 I will give you a quick call next week, just to check in and see how you’re doing, but it 
won’t be a full session. We will talk more in two weeks. 
 OK, let’s get started. Can I ask if you’ve 
watched the DVD? 
 
Review Last Week’s Session -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, let’s review what we learned last time. Please stay on page 17. 
 We talked about the importance of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_528460]. 
Can you remember some complications that can happen from having high blood pressure? 
Let client answer. If needed, remind client that high blood pressure can cause complications 
like stroke, heart attack, dialysis, and blindness.  
 And can you remember some complications of high cholesterol? Let client answer. If 
needed, remind client that high cholesterol can cause heart attacks and strokes.  
 This is why it’s so important for us to keep both of these things under control. Can you 
remind me what is our goal for blood pressure? Let client answer. If needed, remind client 
that our goal is to be below 140/90. What about a normal blood pressure, do you remember 
what that number was? 120/80 is a normal blood pressure.  
 And can you remind me what is our goal for LDL, or “bad,” cholesterol? Let client answer. 
If needed, remind client that our goal is to be below 100.  
 Now, for blood pressure, we learned that there are many different medications available to 
treat high blood pressure. This is why it can take some time to find the right one for you. 
 For cholesterol, on the other hand, there is one main type of medication, the “statins.” 
 As with diabetes medicines, there may be some side effects with blood pressure and 
cholesterol medicines. However, you and your doctor should be able to find a medication 
that works to control your blood pressure and cholesterol and that lets you feel well. 
Remember, don’t just stop – talk to your doc! 
 We also checked on how you were doing with your diabetes medicines and with healthy 
eating and exercise. In the past few weeks, you have been working on all 3 legs of the stool. 
 Does that sound right? Let client answer. Did you have any questions? Let client answer.  
 
Appendix Page |  104

Review DVD: Stress and Your Health -----------------------------------------------------------------  
 Great! Let’s move on and talk about the DVD you watched this week. How did you like it? 
Let the client answer and listen supportively.  
 Let’s review some of the things we saw on the DVD. Please turn to page 18 . Let the client 
get to the page.  
 The video  talked about how being stressed over long periods of time, or having chronic 
stress, can cause problems for our health. 
 People experiencing chronic stress can experience upset stomach, irritability, bad mood, or 
fatigue. Chronic stress can worsen arthritis symptoms, cause weight gain or loss, or cause 
you to have trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_30400]. 
 It can even increase your chances of getting some health conditions. Do you remember what 
those were? Answer: high blood pressure and heart disease.  
 We learned several tips for managing stress in a healthy way. Please stay on page 1 8. 
 First, it’s important to recognize when we’re stressed. Becoming aware of how stress makes 
us feel physically and emotionally is an important step towards dealing with stress in a 
healthy way. How does stress make you feel? Listen supportively.  
 Second, it’s important to identify the sources of stress in our lives. If we’re aware of the 
things and situations that cause us to feel stressed, then we can prepare ourselves ahead of 
time to deal with the stressful situation. What are some of the things in your life that make 
you feel stressed?  Listen supportively.  
 Third, know what helps you relax. Some things that relax you are not so healthy, like 
smoking, or overeating.  These things cause even more health problems in the long run.  
 So it’s important to have healthy ways of dealing with stress so that you can live as well as 
you can, as long as you can.  
 The video mentioned some healthy strategies to relax. Can you remember any of the 
strategies? Let client answer. If needed, remind client that being physically active and 
practicing deep breathing are two great ways to relax. Other talking points:  
 Exercising decreases the level of stress hormones in your body so that you feel less 
stressed and anxious, improving your mood and allowing you to sleep better.  
 In addition to exercise and deep breathing, other helpful things might include:  
calling a friend or a loved one; taking a long, relaxing bath; working in your garden; 
reading a good book; listening to music; or prayer.  
 We’re going to practice one of these strategies together next. Before we do that, did you 
have any questions so far? Let client answer.

Activity 1: Deep Breathing Stress Reduction Technique --------------------------------------------  
 OK, please stay on page 18 in your Activity Book. Let’s practice together the deep breathing 
exercise that you saw on the DVD. 
 This exercise can remove a lot of the stress from our bodies, and you can do it just about 
anywhere. 
 OK, the first step is to get comfortable. Are you comfortable? 
 OK, take some deep and very slow breaths. In…and out…and in…and out. 
 Now, let’s start from the top and work our way down. We’re going to relax every muscle in 
our bodies. Remember to breathe deeply and slowly throughout. 
 Let’s focus on the neck muscles, which are often very tense when we are stressed, and we 
don’t even know it. Focus on relaxing them. 
 Now the upper back…the shoulders…the arms…the chest and stomach. 
 Concentrate on relaxing your back…your thighs…your legs. 
 We’re continuing to breathe deeply…and slowly. 
 Now, we’re going to relax our brain. 
 Our brain is part of our body, and it is working all the time, especially when we are stressed. 
 Now, we’re going to relax our brain, breathing deeply…and slowly. 
 Many people have never relaxed their brains. Let’s begin by [CONTACT_528542]. 
 First, let’s relax and not have any thoughts in response to what I’m saying. 
 Breathing in…and out…deeply…and slowly. 
 Now, do not let your brain respond to anything that I’m saying. Don’t have any thoughts in 
response to what I’m saying. 
 Try to let the sound and the words flow right over you. You hear them, but don’t react to 
them. Just breathe deeply…and slowly. 
 Now, concentrate on your thoughts. Become aware of your thoughts, and then just let them 
flow up…and out…and away. Just like a water fountain…a beautiful water fountain in the 
sunshine. 
 Every new thought that comes, think of it like a sparkling drop of water, floating up…and 
out…and away from you. 
 Don’t react to it…don’t respond to it…it is a 
new thought that flows away. 
 Breathe in…and out…deeply…and slowly.

 Share that you feel great when you do this exercise.  
 Emphasize how good it feels to be rid of stress.  
 Talk about how often we have a lot of stress, and we don’t even know it.  
  Think of a big movie screen that’s blank and white. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Think of your thoughts being images on the movie screen, and as soon as the image is there, 
you let it flow away, disappearing and leaving the screen blank again. 
 Let your mind become blank and white as fewer and fewer new thoughts come, letting each 
of them barely come onto the movie screen before they begin to disappear again. 
 All the time breathing in…and out…deeply…and slowly. 
 OK, that was great! I feel really relaxed! How do you feel?   
 The great thing about this breathing exercise is that you can do it anywhere. If you feel 
stressed at work, you can do this at your desk, or go to the restroom if you really need to get 
away. If the grandkids are really getting to you, go in the kitchen away from them and 
practice deep breathing.  
 
Review of Last Week’s Homework ----------------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, now let’s go over your homework from last week and talk about your homework for the 
next two weeks. Like I mentioned earlier, we won’t be having a full session for two weeks, 
but you’ll continue working on your homework, just like you’ve been doing. 
 Over these two weeks, it will be a great time to start thinking about how you will carry on 
after this program is finishe d. 
 You’ve been focusing on your health and living in a way that will keep you healthy. 
 You’ve learned about the importance of the three-legged stool: eating healthy, being 
physically active, and taking your medications as prescribed by [CONTACT_106224]. 
 You’ve also been setting goals for yourself so that you can tend to all three legs of the stool, 
and you’ve been keepi[INVESTIGATOR_528461].

Note: if the client has not done some of the homew ork [ADDRESS_686071], the investigators may want to help 
the person to succeed. Let them know that someone from the research team will be in touch.  
 Call the research team within 24 hours and let them know what is happening.  
 UAB staff  will brief you on the conversation and the plan so that you can reinforce it next week.   You also took small steps forward, week to week, so that you can continue to live even more 
healthy and do the things that are important to you. 
 Now, we won’t be talking for two weeks. So, if you’ve been able to carry out your plan 
successfully during the upcoming week, you can consider taking another small step forward 
on your own during the second week. 
 For example, you could add another 5 minutes to your exercise plan. 
 You also could add another step towards healthy eating on top of those steps that you’ve 
already taken. You can go back to page 6 in your Activity Book to see your healthy eating 
goals that we discussed a few weeks back. 
 Now, let’s discuss how you did on your homework last week. Can you turn to page 16 in 
your Activity Book? Let client get to the page.   
 Were you able to complete the homework?

Notes:  Continue with Days 2 through 7 before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_528451].  
 For each day, check “Yes” or “No.”  
 For each day, ask client if they took their diabetes medicine,  
even if their blood sugar was normal. Praise them for every  
“yes”  
 If they didn’t take their diabetes medicine every day,  
discuss what happened. Avoid being judgmental.  
 Reassure client that taking medicine every day  
the way the doctor prescrib ed is hard for a lot of people.  
Tell them that you will work together to develop  a plan 
 for this week to help them  take the medicine every day.

 If the ir plan worked and last week’s issue is resolved,  encourage them  to tackle a new issue  this 
week.  If you try hard and they don’t want to tackle another issue and they took their medicine each 
day, try this:  
 Go back to the Client Plan Book.  
 If there are remaining issues related to side effects or cost, then help the client make a plan to 
address them this week.  
 If there are no remaining issues related to side effects or cost, l ook at the list of statements that 
are marked “Very Often” (or “Often” if there are no “Very Often” statements to address, and 
“Sometimes” if there are no “Often” statements to a ddress).  
 Help them decide which new goal they would like to add for the coming week.  
 Summarize to confirm their new goal. For example, you could say:  
“OK, let me see if I got this straight. Last week, you … [repeat last week’s goal]. You did well 
with that , so this week, you’ll … [repeat this week ’s goal]. Did I get that right?”  
 
 If they were not able to meet their medication goal, then let them stick to the sam e goal.

 If the strategy addresses side effects and/or cost, record this week’s strategy on the page, “Plan 
for Diabetes Medication Side Effects and/or Cost,” in the Client Plan Book.  
 If the strategy addresses other barriers besides side effects or cost, then record this week’s 
strategy on the page, “Plan for Other Diabetes Med ication Barriers,” in the Client Plan Book.  
 
 
 
   OK, so what would you like to do over the next week to help you get the most out of your 
medications?  
 
 OK, let’s think about how hard this may be to do. What are some things that might make it 
hard for you to carry out this plan? Write down barriers.  
 OK, what do you think you can do to overcome these things? Help clients think of possible 
solutions to these barriers, and write down those solutions.  
 OK, let’s review that. It looks like you’ll… repeat the medications goal. Then, review 
potential barriers and how client will go around those barriers. Let client confirm.

Say hello and make sure the client 
is still okay with speaking for about 
a half hour to forty minutes today.  
 Greeting -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
 Great, do you have your Activity Book handy? 
If not, let them get the Activity Book before going on.  
 Please turn to page 20. Today, we’ll review what we 
learned during our last session, and then we’ll talk about how your homework went. 
 After today’s session, our next full session will be in four weeks. 
 So, today, we’ll talk about what you’ll be doing for homework for the next four weeks. 
 Now, I will give you a quick call in two weeks, just to check in and see how you’re doing, 
but it won’t be a full session. Like I said, we’ll talk more in four weeks. 
 Do you have any questions? Let client ask questions.  Great, let’s get started! 
 
 
Review Last Session ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 First, let’s review what we learned last time. Please stay on page 20. 
 We talked about the importance of managing stress. Can you remember some of the things 
that people feel if they are stressed over long periods of time? Let client answer. If needed, 
remind client that people with chronic stress can have upset stomach, irritability, bad mood, 
or fatigue. Chronic stress can worsen arthritis symptoms, cause weight gain or loss, or 
cause people to have trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_30400].  
 And having chronic stress can even increase your chances of getting some health conditions. 
Can you remember what they were? Let client answer. If needed, remind client that chronic 
stress can increase your chances of developi[INVESTIGATOR_528464].  
 Because it’s so important for us to manage our stress in a healthy way, the video gave us 
several tips for doing this. Can you remember what some of those tips were? Let client 
answer. If needed, remind client of these tips: 1) recognize when we’re stressed and how we 
feel, physically and emotionally, when we’re stressed; 2) identify the sources of stress in our 
lives so that we can prepare ourselves ahead of time; and 3) know what healthy things we 
can do to help us relax and reduce our stress.  
 We talked about some healthy things that people can do to relax, such as being physically 
active, practicing deep breathing, and calling a friend. We also practiced deep breathing 
together over the telephone. 
 Were you able to try any of these things the last two weeks to help manage your stress? Let 
client answer. If yes, praise client and ask them how it went. If no, share with client how 
these things have helped you, and encourage client to give them a try before the next call.  
 We also checked on how you were doing with your diabetes medicines and with healthy 
eating and exercise. In the past few weeks, you have been working on all 3 legs of the stool. 
 Does that sound right? Let client answer. Did you have any questions? Let client answer.

Note: if the client has not done some of the homew ork [ADDRESS_686078], the investigators may want to help 
the person to succeed. Let them know that someone from the research team will be in touch.  
 Call the research team within 24 hours and let them know what is happening.  
 UAB staff  will brief you on the conversation and the plan so that you can reinforce it next week.  Review Homework For Last Two Weeks ---------------------------------------------------------------  
 OK, now let’s go over your homework from the past two weeks and talk about your 
homework for the next four weeks. 
 Like I mentioned earlier, we won’t be having a full session for four weeks, but you’ll 
continue working on your homework, just like you’ve been doing. 
 These four weeks will be a great way to see how you are able to do your homework on your 
own and make a plan for how you can carry on after the program is finished. 
 In a few minutes, we’ll talk about some things that will help you continue doing the great 
work you’ve been doing to take care of yourself. 
 But first, let’s discuss how you did on your homework during the past two weeks. Can you 
turn to page 19 in your Activity Book? Let client get to the page.

Notes:  If your client 1) took their diabetes medication every day as directed in the past two weeks 
and 2) has successfully overcome  all of the diabetes medication  barriers identified at the 
beginning of the program:  
 Praise profusely ! Tell them to keep up the great work by [CONTACT_528543].  
 Then, go to page 8 8 and continue with Homework #2, Healthy Eating . 
 
If your client was not able to take their diabetes medication every day as directed in the past 
two weeks:  
 Stay on page 8 6 in your manual and continue with setting a diabetes medication goal.  
 Then, go on with the rest of the session.  
 
If your client took their diabetes medication every day as directed in the past two weeks, but 
still has diabetes medication barriers that haven’t been addressed:  
 Check page 8 in the Client Plan Book and see what issues are r emaining. Then, remind 
client about these remaining issues and ask which one they would like to work on next.  
 Go to page 8 7 in your manual and continue with setting a diabetes medication goal.

 If the ir plan worked and last session’s issue is resolved,  encourage them  to tackle a new issue  this 
week.  If you try hard and they don’t want to tackle another issue and they took their medicine each 
day, try this:  
 Go back to the Client Plan Book.  
 If there are remaining issues related to side effects or cost, then help the client make a plan to 
address them this week.  
 If there are no remaining issues related to side effects or cost, l ook at the list of statements that 
are marked “Very Often” (or “Often” if there are no “Very Often” statements to address, and 
“Sometimes” if there are no “Often” stat ements to address).  
 Help them decide which new goal they would like to add for the coming week.  
 Summarize to confirm their new goal. For example, you could say:  
“OK, let me see if I got this straight. Last week, you … [repeat last week’s goal]. You did well 
with that, so  this week, you’ll … [repeat this week ’s goal]. Did I get that right?”  
 
 If they were not able to meet their medication goal, then let them stick to the sam e goal.  
 Be supportive, and l et them know you’ll revisit  the goal next week to see how it went this time.  
 Strategize what they will do differently this week to succeed. Make sure it is a SMART goal.  
 
 Record this week’s strategy in the Client Plan Book.  
 If the strategy addresses side effects/and or cost, record this week’s strategy on the page, “Plan 
for Diabetes Medication Side Effects and/or Cost,” in the Client Plan Book.  
 If the strategy addresses other barriers besides side effects or cost, then record this week’s 
strategy on the page, “Client Plan for Other Diabe tes Medication Barriers,” in the Plan Book.  
 
 
 
   OK, so what would you like to do over the next four weeks to help you get the most out of 
your medications?  
 
 OK, let’s think about how hard this may be to do. What are some things that might make it 
hard for you to carry out this plan? Write down barriers.  
 OK, what do you think you can do to overcome these things? Help clients think of possible 
solutions to these barriers, and write down those solutions.  
 OK, let’s review that. It looks like you’ll… repeat the new medication goal. Then, review 
potential barriers and how client will go around those barriers. Let client confirm.  
 This is a great plan! I look forward to hearing how this plan worked when we talk next time!

If needed, you can ta lk with client about  the three rules of eating healthy:  
1. One and Done – this rule reminds us to avoid second helpi[INVESTIGATOR_14839]  
2. Respect the Border  – this rule reminds us to not overload our plate, and divide up the plate so 
that half of the plate is fruit and vegetab les, a quarter of the plate is protein, and a quarter of the 
plate is starchy foods  
3. Be Sweet On Yourself – this rule reminds us to eat less fried foods and fats, and drink fewer 
sugar -sweetened drinks  
 
 
 
If needed, you can talk about the client about the three rules of physical activity:  
1. Be Smart, Exercise Your Heart – this rule reminds us that exercise has many benefits  
2. Walk Down Your Blood Sugar – this rule reminds us that walking and other kinds of physical 
activity can help lower our blood sugar  
3. Sitting is the New Smoking – this rule reminds us that it is unhealthy to sit too long, and we 
should try to be active throughout the day, even if it’s just 2 minutes of light acti vity every hour  
If needed, you can talk about some of the basics of diabetes medications:  
 Medications are important for diabetes, but they aren’t perfect – diabetes progresses, even on 
medications. So, even if you’re doing everything right, you may eventually need a second or third 
medication.  
 However, diabetes progresses much more quickly without medications. Medications, together 
with diet and exercise, can prevent or delay complications like stroke, dialysis, heart attack, and 
amputations.  
 Side effects can be a problem, but you should discuss with your doctor before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
Remember that there are many types of diabetes medications available, so you should be able  to 
get on a medication that controls your sugar and lets you feel well.  
 Another problem with medications can be how much they cost. However, there are generic 
medications for diabetes that work as well as brand -name [CONTACT_528571].  Activity 1. What Have I Learned, and How Are the Activities Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]?  ------------------------ 

 How about exercise? What have you learned about living a physically active life? 
 
 And what have you learned about your diabetes medications and what they can do for you?

If needed, you can remind them these things about medications for blood pressure and cholesterol:  
 Like with diabetes, there are many different medications available to treat high blood pressure.  
 So, if you have high blood pressure, you should be able to get on a medication that controls your 
blood pressure and lets you feel well.  
 For high cholesterol, there is one main type of medicine, called statins. Most people taking a 
statin to treat their high cholesterol feel well and have no side effects.  
 However, if you ever feel side effects with either blood pressure or cholesterol medicine, don’t 
just stop: always reach out to your doctor first.  
 Finally, if you are worried about the  cost of these medications, there are generic medications for 
blood pressure and cholesterol that work as well as brand -name [CONTACT_528571].  
 
  And can you recall what medications can do for you if you have high blood pressure or high 
cholesterol? 
 
 Great! It’s good to keep in mind that paying attention to all three legs of the stool – eating 
healthy, being physically active, and taking your medications – can make a big difference in 
how you are able to live now as well as your life many years down the road. 
 Now that you’ve been working on the three-legged stool for the past month and a half, let’s 
think about how it’s helpi[INVESTIGATOR_56109]. Please turn to page 21 in your Activity Book. 
 On that page, you can see some of the ways that people have been helped by [CONTACT_528546], 
exercising, and taking their medications.  
 How about you? Have you been helped in these ways? Let’s go down the list together and 
check the boxes that apply to you.  
 How about your blood sugar? Has your blood sugar gotten better?  
 How about your weight?  
 How about your energy?  
 How about your mood?  
 How about your ability to take care of your family?  
 How about your ability to do your job?  
 How about going out?  
 Now, the things that we’ve been talking about are some of the ways that eating healthy, 
exercising, and taking your medications are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528467]. Take a minute and 
think about how taking care of the three-legged stool can help you a bit further down the line  
 How about your chances of experiencing complications from your diabetes? Do you 
think taking care of the three-legged stool is helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528468]?  
 How about your chances of being there for important events down the road, like [repeat

Notes:  Activity 2: How Can I Keep Going in the Future? Health Buddy ---------------------------------  
 Thanks so much for sharing with me what you have learned about eating healthy, exercising, 
and taking your medications. You have done such a great job, and made a lot of progress. 
 Now, we have one more full session, in four weeks’ time. I’ll be calling you in two weeks, 
but it’ll be just a brief call to check in and see how you’re doing. 
 So, in the next month, you’ll practice setting goals and taking care of the three-legged stool, 
mostly on your own. 
 I mention this, because research has shown that, once a program like this comes to an end, 
people may stop doing the good things that helped them during the program. 
 This is understandable! It can be hard to keep going all on your own. 
 One thing that may help is to have a Health Buddy, or a person in your life that can support 
you as you continue practicing those things to live well with diabetes. 
 So, let’s turn to page 22 in your Activity Book and look at the image. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Now, think about the main person in your family that supports you. Can you tell me who this

 Let client stick to the same goal, but be sure to modify the plan if needed.  
 Summarize. For example, say: OK, let me see if I got this straight. Last week, you [repeat last week’ s 
goal], and you did pretty well with that, so now you’d like to add another 5 minutes each day. That 
means that, this week, you’d like to [repeat this week’s goal]. Did I get that right?   OK, what would you like to do this week in terms of exercise?

 If they succeeded in getting a Health Buddy, discuss how that went.  
 If they did not succeed in getting a Health Buddy, ask them if they want to try the same person again 
or if they want to try another person. Wri te down what they decide in the box below:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 If they cannot think of a person to be their Health Buddy, contact [CONTACT_528548]’s session.  
 Note:  
o Sometimes a client may want to have more than one Health Buddy (for example, one Health 
Buddy to help them be physically active, another Health Buddy to go shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_528471], or another Health Buddy to remind each other to refill 
medications or accompany each other to their doctor’ s appointment).  
o Encourage your client to have one main Health Buddy.  
o However, if they feel like they would be helped more by [CONTACT_528549], 
that is fine. Be sure to write that down in the box above.  Notes:  Activity 1. Planning for the Future with Your Health Buddy --------------------------------------  
 You’ve spent another month doing a great job to take care of yourself! As you continue to 
work on eating healthy, being physically active, and taking your medications, how do you 
feel? Listen supportively, and provide praise and encouragement.  
 Over the past three months, you have learned about the importance of the three-legged stool 
for living well with diabetes. Healthy eating, exercise, and medications will help you live 
well now so that you can do what you need to do, day to day. 
 Doing these things also will help you stay well so that you can accomplish your long-term 
goals and be there for important events in the future. 
 You learned how to eat healthy, get exercise, and take medications in ways that work for you 
and your life, and you kept track of how you’re able to do these things so that you can see 
the progress that you’re making. 
 Now, our hope is that you can keep going once the program ends. But, research has shown 
that, once a program like this ends, it can be hard for people to keep doing the good things 
that helped them during the program. 
 This is understandable! It can be hard to keep going all on your own. 
 Now, during our last session, we talked about a Health Buddy, or a person in your life that 
can help you to keep living well once the program ends. 
 Let’s talk about how things went with your Health Buddy. So the last time we talked, you 
were going to contact [ name [CONTACT_528576] 96 in your manual ] and talk to them 
about being your Health Buddy. How did that go?  
  
Appendix Page |  153
 114 
 If needed, use your motivational interviewing skills to help them figure out how they can engage the 
Health Buddy to help them with eating health y, being physically active, and taking medications.  
 
 Here are some suggestions for how the Health Buddy can help:  
o Someone to talk to when feeling stressed, or feeling down or blue.  
o Someone to exercise with.  
o Someone to help you eat healthy (for example, go shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_528472], swappi[INVESTIGATOR_528473], preparing healthy meals, making healthy choices when you go out to eat or when you’re 
attending a party)  
o Someone to help you to take your medications (for example, getting refills on time, accompanying 
you to doctor’s visits, talking to the pharmacist with you)  
 
 It’s also good to remind your client that they will be helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528474], too!  
o Your client will help their Health Buddy live well now, so that they can do what they need to 
do, day to day.  
o Your client also will help  their Health Buddy to stay well so that they can accomplish their 
long-term goals and be there for important events in the future.   As I mentioned before, it can be very helpful to have a Health Buddy to help you continue 
living well after the program ends. 
 Now, can you think of some things you could do with your Health Buddy to help you keep 
taking care of the three-legged stool? 
 
 
Homework for Next Four Weeks ------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 Great! We’re almost done. The only thing left to do is go over your homework for the next 
four weeks. Please turn to page 26 in your Activity Book. 
 For the next four weeks, you’ll continue your homework for each leg of the 3-legged stool. 
 You’ll carry out the plan we discussed that will help you get the most out of your medicines. 
 You’re also going to mark down whether you kept to your heathy eating goal on the days 
that we discussed. Your plan is to… repeat the healthy eating goal from today written in the 
Client Plan Book.  
 So, under the column with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_528452], you’re going to mark “Yes” if you were able 
to follow your healthy eating goal on the days we discussed. 
 The goal is to eat healthy every day, so if you are able to follow your healthy eating goal on 
the other days, mark “Yes” on those days, too. 
 If you do well with your goal this week, you could add another step towards healthy eating 
the following week. You can go back to page 6 in your Activity Book to see your healthy 
eating goals and see if you would like to work on another goal for the following week. 
 You’re going to monitor the number of minutes of exercise every day. You decided that you 
would try… repeat the exercise goal from today written in the Client Plan Book.  
Appendix Page |  154
 115 
 Try to make the  dates as close to 28 
days from now as possible.  
 Schedule it at least 28 days from 
today, but no more than 31 days.   So, under the column with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_510] a person walking, you’re going to write down the 
number of minutes of exercise you were able to do on the days we discussed. 
 If you are doing well with your goal and were able to exercise on the other days, write down 
the number of minutes of exercise you did on those days, too. 
 Also, if you do well with your goal this week, you could add another step towards being 
physically active, like adding 5 more minutes to your plan during the following week. 
 Do you have any questions about what to do? Make sure client knows what to do.  
 OK, remember that we’re not going to talk again for four weeks. When we do talk, we’ll be 
talking for thirty minutes or so to make sure everything is going well with your homework. 
 Now, if you are having trouble with your homework, we’ll talk until we figure out what we 
can do to help you get back on track. Do you have any questions? Let client answer.  
 OK, when would you like to talk in four weeks? 
 
 
 
 Great! Please go ahead and write down the date and time in your Activity Book on page 27. 
 I will be speaking with you in four weeks. I look forward to hearing how things went!

goal], and you did pretty well with that, so now you’d like to add another 5 minutes each day. That 
means that, this week, you’d like to [repeat this wee k’s goal]. Did I get that right?   OK, even though the program is over today, you can continue setting goals for yourself to 
continue being physically active. So, what would you like to do next for exercise?  
 
 OK, let’s think about how hard this may be to do. What are some things that might make it 
hard for you to carry out this plan? Write down potential barriers.  
 OK, what do you think you can do to overcome these things? Help clients think of possible 
solutions to these barriers, and write down those solutions.  
 This is a great plan!

Homework and Wrappi[INVESTIGATOR_528477] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 You have been doing a wonderful job with the three-legged stool! And keepi[INVESTIGATOR_528475]’re doing with this. 
 I know that we talked a few sessions ago about how eating healthy, being physically active, 
and taking your medications are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528478] y ou 
can achieve your goals down the line. Have you thought any more about that since we 
talked? If needed, share with client your own day- to-day efforts to live a healthy, active life 
and how that effort is paying off now, because you are able to do the things that you need to 
do right now, and paying off later, because you will be able to accomplish things that matter 
to you and be there for important events in the future.  
 I just want to tell you I’m so proud of the great work you have done in this program. 
 Now that you have completed the program, you’ll be in charge of your own homework from 
here on out! 
 You can continue to use the Activity Book if you find it helpful. 
 Also, research has shown that monitoring yourself, like the way you’ve been keepi[INVESTIGATOR_528479], can help you improve more than if you don’t monitor yourself. 
 If you turn to page 32 in your Activity Book, you can see that there are a lot more pages for 
you to use if you want to keep track of your homework. 
 Now that you know what to do, you can monitor on your own. 
 Also, your Health Buddy can help you with this, much like I did. 
 Now, you may stop keepi[INVESTIGATOR_528480]-legged stool. 
 If that happens, then it may be helpful to keep track of your healthy eating, physical activity, 
and medications every day, just like you did during the program. 
 Don’t forget to reach out to your doctor if you have trouble taking care of any part of the 
three-legged stool, especially if you have trouble with your medications. 
 Just remember that taking care of the three-legged stool will help you live well now and live 
well in the future , so that you can accomplish things that are important to you, like [repeat 
long-term goals from page 3 in the Client Plan Book].  
 Now, the study staff will be in touch to talk with you again within the next month. 
 Do you have any questions? Give client chance to ask questions.  
 I hope this program has helped you. It’s been a pleasure to work with you!

Examples of strategies to overcome each medication barrier:  
1. I just forget to take them:  weekly pi[INVESTIGATOR_173105], take them at the same time each day (breakfast, brushing  
teeth, etc.), put a reminder on the fridge; if traveling the next day, place 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_14704] a pouch or zip lock bag in your purse or your jacket the night 
before 
2. I forgot to fill my prescription in 
time:  ask the pharmacist if they can call you when it’s time, ask for a 90-day 
supply, ask pharmacy if they have an automatic reminder program that can call you or send you a text, ask a family member to keep track of your refill date with you; ask family member to pi[INVESTIGATOR_528483]’t 
3. I don’t know what dose to take:  have the client read the label to you and go over how to take it; if needed, 
call the doctor together to clarify 
4. I’m not sure exactly what each 
medicine is for:  go over the medicine together with the client; using the list of medicines 
in the back of your manual, let them know what the medicine is for 
5. There are too many doses to 
take each day:  go over the dosing schedule (see below box of common 
misunderstandings); if needed, call the doctor to see if there is another 
option that has fewer doses per day; if there are no other options, 
consider pi[INVESTIGATOR_528484] a routine (meals, brushing teeth, etc.) 
6. It’s too hard to keep track of 
what I am supposed to take when:  pi[INVESTIGATOR_528485]; go over the list with the client and 
make sure they understand how to take each one; use color-coding to know which medications to take (example: put a red sticker on all medicines you’re supposed to take in the morning, put a blue sticker on all the medicines you’re supposed to take in the evening; put both red 
and blue stickers on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_528486]’re supposed to take it both AM 
and PM) 
7. They are unpleasant to take:  take with a strongly flavored drink, drink a lot of water; if having trouble 
swallowing a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], check with doctor to see if it’s okay to crush it up in Jell-O or applesauce; think of a future goal right before you take the 
medicine 
8. I can’t afford them Ask the pharmacist for generics or what may be cheaper and then ask 
him to call the doctor, apply for free medications from the drug company  
9. My medicines make me feel bad 
or have side effects I don’t like. Talk to the doctor about cutting back the dose, or switching to a cheaper 
medicine 
10. I have heard about side effects 
that I am afraid I might get Talk to the pharmacist about how often people get the side effect you are 
afraid of, not everyone gets side effects, it’s possible the side effects you heard about are not true – there are a lot of rumors and misinformation  
-Reassured client that everyone is different and not everyone has side 
effects; always useful to provide a real world example  -All medicines have side effects/ make sure client is correctly taking the 
Appendix Page |  225
	
   28 medication (ex: eating food with medications) 
 -Reassure the client. Talk through the symptoms of the side effect with the client. Tell the client to talk to their pharmacist and doctor if they 
experience any of the side effects 
 
11. Getting to the pharmacy to 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_528487] a 90 day supply, ask a friend or family member for help, plan 
ahead, use a mail-order pharmacy 
12. The pharmacy could not fill 
my prescription Call the pharmacy and find out why – could be they were temporarily out 
of stock, prescription expi[INVESTIGATOR_528488] (by [CONTACT_2371], prescriptions are only filled for 1 year no matter how many refills are 
ordered) 
13. My doctor or nurse forgot to 
write a new prescription Call the doctor and ask them to phone it in to the pharmacy 
14. I ran out of medication before I 
could call or visit my doctor or nurse Plan ahead, ask the pharmacy to set up regular calls before you run out, 
you can call the doctor the same day and they will call the pharmacy that day, use a calendar 
15. I don’t have enough time to 
talk with my doctor or nurse about problems I am having with my medicines. Tell the doctor anyway, start with this problem at your next visit (they 
always ask how you are), write things down and show the list to the nurse, bring a younger friend or family member who can help you to get your problems heard  -Leave a note with the receptionist and nurse to have a doctor call you  
 -The night before, write down your questions  
-prioritize items on the list / questions so that the most important o nes are 
covered during visit.  
16. I sometimes forget to ask my 
doctor or nurse about problems that I am having with my medicines. Write it down ahead of the visit, bring the list, bring a friend or family 
member 
17. I don’t feel my medicines are 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528489] (this program), 
realize that even if the medicine is not controlling your sugar it would be 
even worse off the medicine, the medicines mostly prevent long-term complications so it can be hard to know if they are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_528490]  -Talk to the doctor or nurse or pharmacy, this depends on the client  
-Get the pharmacist’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] -Talk to them and see if they feel better now than before they started, 
(may have felt bad before the doctor started on the medication and after 
they started the meds they felt better). 
18. I just don’t like taking Most people don’t like taking medicine so you’re not alone, years ago 
Appendix Page |  226
	
   29 medicine in general. people didn’t have these options and complications were a lot more 
common, want to avoid complications, think positive thoughts about you long-term goal and that the medicine will help you get there alive and well 
 -Talk about what the client wants to accomplish? Talk about why they want to accomplish this - emphasis the positive benefits – such as living as long as you can, as well as you can - provide your personal story as an example – say if you didn’t like taking medications and why; and what lead you to believe that medications were needed. 
19. Taking medicines makes my 
health worse Ask the doctor for a different medicine to minimize side effects, there are 
a lot of different options available nowadays, although you may have side effects the medicine is lowering your risks of bad things like stroke or dialysis  -Cost-benefit comparison -Discussing your numbers with your doctor and relationship with medicines 
-Talk to your doctor about alternating medications 
-How and what way does the medicine make health worse, severity of the side effects -Finding a medicine that works for you à work with you -Have a notebook to keep all of your documents 
20. I sometimes find it hard to ask 
my doctor or nurse questions about my medications Write it down, practice at home, take a friend/family member with you

3Introduction
1. Baseline Measurements
Among the goals of the Living Well Study is to determine if the program improve HbA1c, blood pressure, weight, and  
physical function. These values will be measured at the beginning of the study and after the 12-week program. 
Measurements on each participant will be made at a community venue or in the participant’s home. Measurements will 
be made in a separate room or, at minimum, in an area properly screened from other participants. Participants should be wearing a loose fitting shirt that allows full access to the arm for blood pressure measurement. 
If asked, the research assistant measuring and recording the values may tell the participant their values at the time of measur ement.
Remind the participant that they will receive a “report ca rd” with the measurement values and an explanation of the values.The Living Well with Diabetes Study is a randomized controlled trial enrolling [ADDRESS_686104] of 3 types of activitie:R5Gathering baseline measurements (blood pressure, A1c, LDL-Cholesterol, weight, height)
R5Generating a participant medication list
R5Providing the participant with their measurements in the form of a report card. 
[ADDRESS_686105]. You will be writing down the names, dosages, and frequencies of the participant’s medications. 
3. Report Card
Participants will receive a report card and an explanation of what the values mean in general terms.
This manual will provide details on how each of the activities should be completed. Since Living Well is a research study, we all all Biometric personnel to strictly follow these 
protocols so that we can be certain these measurements are accurate the precise.

4Blood Pressure
It will take approximately 10-[ADDRESS_686106] measurement taken during the in-person data collection visit.
1. Equipment and Supplies.
R5LifeSource Blood Pressure Monitor (Model UA 789)
R5Blood pressure cuffs (medium, large, extra large sizes)
R5Tape measure
R5Eyebrow pencil
R5Chair with back support
R5Table to rest arm
1.1. Maintenance of Equipment
With each use:
R5Device is turned off at the completion of each participant’s examination.
R5Squeeze all air from the cuff
R5Confirm that the connection of the cuff to the tubing is secure and tubing is not kinked.
Monhtly:R5Inspect cuff and tubing for cracks or tears. If a leak is suspeced, place the cuff around an unopened, full, 12-ounce can, 
start the monitor, and submerge the cuff in water. If there is a leak, air bubbles will start to rise from the area of the leak . 
Replace the cuff if a leak is detected. 
R5Wipe the exterior of the monitor with a clean cloth slightly dampened with mild detergents.
R5Check the blood pressure cuffs to assure all sizes of cuffs are available.
R5Inspect the measuring tape used to measure arm circumference for damage or wear.
2. Participant Preparation.
Participants should not drink any caffeine (from coffee, tea, or soda), should not eat or do any heavy physical activity, smoke, ingest alcohol for 30 minutes prior to recording the blood pressure.
2.1. Arm Circumference
The blood pressure is taken on the right arm. If the participant’s right arm is injured or missing, or if the participant reports a compelling reason to avoid measurement in this arm, suc h as a mastectomy on the right side, use the left arm for 
the blood pressure measurement. Measure the participant’s arm to determine the appropriate cuff size before allowing the participant to rest. Use the following procedures to measure the participant’s arm and determine the appropriate cuff size:
R5Proper measurement requires that the participant’s arm is bare to the shoulder. The participant should be wearing a 
loose-fitting top.
R5Request the participant to stand facing away from the examiner with the right elbow bent 90 degrees at the elbow with the hand on the stomach. The upper arm should be at a 90-degree angle to the lower arm.
R5Measure arm length from the bony prominence of the shoulder girdle (acromion) to the tip of the elbow (olecranon 
process) using a tape measure.
R5Mark the midpoint on the dorsal (back) surface of the arm with an eyebrow pencil.
R5Ask the participant to relax their arm along the side of the body.
R5Wrap the tape measure horizontally around the arm at the midpoint mark, but do not indent the skin. Make the measurement to the nearest 0.5 cm (round down).
R5Use the measurement to determine the correct cuff size. Wipe pencil mark off participant’s skin
$SSHQGL[3DJH_
version 2016-March
5Do not use the markings on the blood pressure cuff for reference. Instead, use the criteria in the chart below for 
determining the appropriate cuff size for the participant.
3. Measurement Procedures.
The blood pressure can be measured after any period where the participant has been sitting quietly (no talking or completing forms) for [ADDRESS_686107] 30 minutes after ingestion of caffeine. After applying the appropriate sized blood pressure cuff, the participant should sit for 5 minutes with his/her feet flat on the floor and legs and ankles uncrossed. Two blood pressure readings will be obtained.
3.1 Application of the cuff
R5Ensure that the participant is seated comfortably in a chair with back supported and both feet are flat on the floor.
R5Make sure that the participant’s arm is resting on the table at a 90-degree angle with the palm facing up.
R5Palpate the brachial artery.
R5Mark the brachial artery with an eyebrow pencil.
R5Attach the appropriate-sized cuff to the monitor by [CONTACT_528554].
R5Place the cuff around the upper right arm, approximately at heart level, with the participant’s palm facing upward (the participant may rest their forearm and elbow on a table or ar m of the chair). Place the lower edge of the cuff with its 
tubing connections about one inch above the natural crease across the inner aspect of the elbow.
R5Wrap the cuff snugly about the arm, with the inflatable inner bladder centered over the area of the brachial artery. The brachial artery is usually found at the crease of the arm, slightly toward the body. Secure the wrapped cuff firmly by 
[CONTACT_528555]. You should be able to insert the first joint of two fingers under the cuff.
R5If it is not feasible to measure blood pressure using the right arm, the left arm will be used. Mark which arm is used for 
the measurement on the Biometric Data Collection Form.

inserted.
R5If “QCOK” is not displayed, please see the Troubleshooting section.
R5Record A1c value in the data collection packet.
2.7. Troubleshooting
R5See the table below for a description of A1cNOW+ operating and error codes.
R5OR = Out of Range / QC = Quality Control / E = Monitor Error
Message Description and Resolution
OR 1The blood sample may have too little hemoglobin (less than 20% hematocrit), not enough blood 
was collected, or the blood was not well mixed inside the Sampler.* You may wish to check he-matocrit by [CONTACT_179323].
OR 2The blood sample may have too much hemoglobin (greater than 60% hematocrit), or excess blood was collected.* You may wish to check hematocrit by [CONTACT_179323].
OR [ADDRESS_686116] too little A1C, or insufficient blood was collected.*
OR [ADDRESS_686117] too much A1C, or excess blood was collected.*OR 5 The Monitor temperature is below 180C (640F). Repeat the test at room temperature.OR 6 The Monitor temperature is above 280C (820F). Repeat the test at room temperature.
<4.0 The %A1C is less than 4%.
>13.0 The %A1C is greater than 13%.
QC 2Occurs when you insert a Test Cartridge that already has sample added to it. Do not remove and 
reinsert Test Cartridge after adding sample.*
QC 6Sample was added to Test Cartridge before “SMPL” display. This counts down one test on the 
Monitor. Remove and discard Test Cartridge. To avoid this error, do not add sample until the “WAIT” prompt clears and “SMPL” appears.
QC 7The Test Cartridge remained in the Monitor without sample addition for 2 minutes after “SMPL” prompt. This counts down one test on the Monitor. Discard the Test Cartridge and 
insert a fresh one when you are ready to dispense the Sampler.
QC 30-33The Monitor was unable to obtain a valid initial reading. Be sure to remove the Sampler within one second after dispensing it into the sample port, and do not disturb the Monitor while the test is running. *
QC 50-[ADDRESS_686118] Cartridge. To avoid this error be sure to fully insert the Blood Collector into the Sampler and shake immediately.*
All other 
QC codesThe quality control checks did not pass. Call Bayer Technical Support toll-free at [PHONE_10946] x 1. The test will have to be repeated with another Test Cartridge and Sample Dilution Kit.
E1-E99 The Monitor has a Fatal Error. Call Bayer Technical Support toll-free at [PHONE_10946] x 1.
*Carefully repeat the test using a new Test Cartridge and a new Sample Dilution Kit.

123. Quality Assurance.
3.1 Training requirements
The technician requires no special qualifications for performing this assessment. Training includes:
R5Read and study manual and data collection packet
R5Attend Living Well training session on techniques 
R5Practice on other staff or volunteers
R5Discuss problems and questions with program coordinator 
 
3.[ADDRESS_686119]
R5Obtains sample per “obtaining blood sample” section of manual.
R5Properly measures and records A1c measurementt.
3.4 Control
R5Use liquid control solution to calibrate machine. 
R5Each A1CNow+ Monitor performs over 50 internal c hemical and electronic quality control checks, including 
potential hardware and software errors (e.g. cartridge alignment, programming), and potential reagent strip errors (e.g. 
insufficient sample volume, invalid calculations). The Monitor has been programmed to report an error code if these quality checks are not passed.
R5Quality control testing should be performed at the following times:
R5With each new shipment.
R5With each new lot.
R5With each new operator.
R5Whenever problems (storage, operator, instrument, or other) are identified.
R5To ensure that storage conditions have not affected the product, run a control sample before running a patient sample if the test kit has been stored for more than a month and it has been at least a month since the last control testing.
R5The measured value should be within the acceptable limits stated for the control material. If the results obtained are outside the acceptable limit, please review the procedure and re-test the control material. If the measured value continues to fall outside the acceptable limit, please refrain from  analyzing additional patient samples and contact [CONTACT_528557] ([PHONE_10946]).
R5Good laboratory practices include a complete quality control program. This entails proper sample collection and handling practices, ongoing training of testing personnel, ong oing evaluation of control results, proper storage of test 
kits, etc. A permanent record of control results should be retained.2.7. Reuse Monitor
R5The Monitor is reusable (either [ADDRESS_686120] system).
R5To run another test, use a new sampler and test cartridge from the same kit.
R5Discard the test cartridge.

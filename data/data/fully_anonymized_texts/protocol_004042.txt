Background:  
 
Endothelial Disease and Cardiovascular Risk  
 
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the [LOCATION_002].1,[ADDRESS_602953] vital organs 
such as the heart, brain and kidneys at risk.  There is a reduction in coronary artery perfusion6 and increased 
risks of stroke, renal impairment and hypertrophic heart disease.7  Furthermore, the effects of shear stress on 
these stiff vessels promote vascular remodeling and thickening.8  Endothelial thickening coincides with a 
decreased production of endogenous vasodilatory mediators, su ch as nitric oxide, further creating non -
distensible arteries without a propensity for vascular dilation.  Ultimately this thickening and lack of elasticity fail 
to properly regulate blood flow and further vital, end -organ damage results.    
 
Heat Therapy and Endothelial Function  
 
In humans, previous work has demonstrated that heat exposure can improve arterial endothelial function.9-11  
In sedentary adults, heat therapy via water immersion had widespread beneficial effects on vascular dilatation 
and a redu ction in arterial stiffness.10  After eight weeks (4 -5 times/week) of heat therapy, participants had 
several markers of improved vascular reactivity including increased flow -mediated dilatation (FMD), improved 
arterial compliance, reduced aortic pulse wave  velocity, decreased carotid intima media thickness and 
decreased blood pressure.   
 
Other studies utilized infrared, dry sauna therapy daily for eight weeks in patients with cardiovascular risk.  In 
patients with at least one coronary risk factor, flow -mediated dilatation was improved by 5.3%.[ADDRESS_602954] 2% have 
been correlated with a 15% reduction in cardiovascular risk.10,12  A follow up study showed that in pati ents with 
congestive heart failure, heat therapy not only improved flow -mediated dilatation but also decreased plasma 
brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels indicating less congestive heart failure burden.9 
 
Mechanism of Endothelial Improvement: Heat Shock  Proteins  
 
A major mechanism thought to be involved in the improvements in vascular tone with heat therapy are the 
expression of heat shock proteins (HSP).13  Heat shock proteins are cytoprotective molecular chaperones that 
accelerate cellular repair and b lock cell death.14  Heat shock proteins are also thought to be beneficial to 
arterial integrity in that there is association of anti -inflammatory13 and anti -oxidative effects with HSP 
response.15  In addition, in bovine coronary endothelial cells, one part icular HSP, Hsp90, has been shown to 
be associated with the critical step by [CONTACT_470461].16  Nitric oxide is an important 
Updated 06/30 /[ADDRESS_602955] important for 
thermo tolerance by [CONTACT_470462] -associated endotoxin translocation and by [CONTACT_470463]’s 
inflammatory response.17  Transgenic mice overexpressing Hsp72 display a 2 -fold increase in running capacity 
relative to wildtype mice and exhibit a 50% increase in m itochondria.18  Increased expression of Hsp72 could 
therefore contribute to an increase in aerobic capacity following chronic heat therapy.   
 
Study Aim:   
 
Translation of Endothelial Modifications using Heat Therapy into Cardiovascular Fitness Improvement  
 
In this study, we will assess if the reported improvements in endothelial function translate into improved 
cardiovascular function.  Since heat therapy has been shown to illicit several molecular markers of benefit for 
endothelial function inc luding enhancement of FMD and other markers of arterial distensibility, there is a 
potential direct benefit for cardiovascular health and fitness.  As of today, these benefits remain theoretical.   
 
Improvements in cardiovascular function are measured by i ncreased exercise tolerance with various strategies 
of fitness testing.  Historically, the gold standard of fitness testing relies on measurements of maximal oxygen 
consumption (VO 2max).  There are numerous methods to obtaining VO 2max, however some methods  are 
invasive, require significant equipment and/or require intense exercise by [CONTACT_2299].  The methods chosen 
for this study are validated, utilize two different mechanisms of VO 2max measurements in order to enhance 
reliability, are noninvasive and require minimal exercise in which the participant can rest when needed to 
ensure safety.  
 
Oxygen consumption testing (VO 2) will be measured with a treadmill exercise respi[INVESTIGATOR_470447]. This test 
measures VO2 indirectly by [CONTACT_470464].  Th is method is known as indirect calorimetry and 
is the gold standard for measuring energy expenditure19. Study participants will complete the treadmill exercise 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_470448], prior to the hot tub session.  This ex ercise will also be 
performed on within [ADDRESS_602956] various hemodynamic data points prior to, during and after hot tub sessions 
utilizing the Clearsight© (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA ) monitor.[ADDRESS_602957] of heat therapy on the cardiovascular system since all of 
these data points are functions of arterial distensibility.  Alterations to these hemodynamic variables is directly 
reflective of cardiovascular tone.  This information will further the understanding of the relationship of heat 
therapy and endothelial tone in a real -time and an in vivo  setting.

 Methods:  
 
All experimental procedures will be approved through T[LOCATION_006]H institutional review board prior to advertisement 
for volunteers.  Participants will volunteer in response to advertisements placed in public areas in The 
University of Kansas Health Systems.  All s ubjects will provide oral and written informed consent prior to 
participation.  Monetary compensation of $100 will be offered upon completion of the study.  The hot tub used 
to provide immersion is located in the Clinical and Translational Science Unit (CT SU), Fairway, KS.  
 
Study Cohort and Safety  
 
Twenty adults, age 50 or older, will be included in the study.  Demographic data required for pertinent 
calculations will be obtained from each participant including height, weight, age and gender.  Exclusion cri teria 
includes current major cardiovascular disease known to the patient including recent myocardial infarction, 
stroke, angina pectoris, high grade coronary vasculopathy or atherosclerosis, severe valvular disease, current 
cardiac dysrhythmia that require s treatment (i.e. atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, frequent ventricular premature 
beats and/or implantation of permanent pacemaker/defibrillator).  Patients with a history of coronary artery 
by[CONTACT_15806], valvular surgeries and coronary intervention s will be assessed as to current exercise tolerance 
and symptomology.  Other exclusion criteria include current treatment with steroids or immunosuppressive 
agents, current malignancy, serious liver disease, end -stage renal disease or judgement by a medica l provider 
that water or heat therapy poses an undue burden or risk upon the individual.  All females of child bearing age 
will consent to pregnancy testing and will be excluded if pregnant.  Should a participant become 
hemodynamically or cognitively impai red during any portion of the study activities, [ADDRESS_602958] demonstrated that benefits from heat therapy require 5 -14 days to become apparent.9-
11,14  Thus, participants in the present study will undergo 8 -10 shoulder -high hot water immersions of 40.5°C for 
45 minutes/session duri ng a 14 -16-day period.  Either 1) a rectal probe with sterile disposable sheaths or 2) a 
sterile rectal thermistor probe will be used to monitor the subject’s temperature (T re).  These probes are 
inserted approximately 2.[ADDRESS_602959] will be removed from the hot tub if T re is 
38.5°C or higher.  Participants will be asked to sit on a bench of the hot tub with until T re is < 38.0°C at which 
time they may return to the hot tub.  Participants are able to drink water ad libitum  while in the hot tub.  T re will 
be monitored for 10 additional minutes following emersion from the hot tub or until T re < 38.0°C.  
 
 Hot tub located in the CRC at KUMC.  
 
Subjects will have dry weights measured prior to and after hot water therapy.  If body weight loss following 
therapy is > 1%, the participant will be asked to drink additional fluids to make up the difference.  Heart rate will 
be monitored continuously during heat therapy.  If heart rate is altered > 50% from baseline, the participant w ill 

Updated 06/30 /[ADDRESS_602960] will be removed from the hot tub, temperature monitored,  and a medical provider notified.   Blood 
pressure will be obtained prior to and after hot water therapy.  Participants with pre -therapy systolic blood 
pressure < 75mmHg or > 180mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure < 40mmHg or > 90mmHg, will not be 
allowed to participate in hot water therapy.  If post -hot tub blood pressure varies by >  20% lower or > 30% 
higher than baseline values, the subject will be monitored until return to < 20% deviation from baseline.  If 
blood pressure values do not return to baseline after [ADDRESS_602961] prior to discharge from CTSU.  If at any time, should a participant become hemodynamically or 
cognitively impaired during any portion of the study activities, 911 will be called for evaluation and possible 
transport to the emergency department at T[LOCATION_006]H.  
 
Cardiovascu lar performance: Oxygen consumption measurements  
 
Study participants will complete the treadmill exercise respi[INVESTIGATOR_470449].  This exercise will 
also be performed on within [ADDRESS_602962].  Importantly, waiting until the next day to perform the 
laboratory and exercise testing also ensures that the  changes seen are not acute benefits of heat therapy, but 
are chronic.   
 
Measurements:  
 
The following data will be collected at two separate time points: T1 = beginning of the study, prior to hot water 
immersion; and T2 = at the end of the study, [ADDRESS_602963] hot tub experience.  
 
1. Blood pressure, stroke volume, stroke volume variation, cardiac index and systemic vascular 
resistance, heart rate with the Clearsight© (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) monitor  
2. VO 2 as measured with treadmill exerc ise respi[INVESTIGATOR_038]  
3. Blood collection tube of approximately 4 tablespoons of blood to assess complete blood count, 
complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and serum heat shock protein measurements (Hsp72 and 
Hsp90)  
 
Risks:  
 
Whole -Body Heat Therapy:   
 
There are some risks associated with heat exposure, including: fatigue, light -headedness, muscle cramps, 
dehydration, and neurological detriments (i.e. heat stroke). However, these symptoms do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_470450] 40°C. Co re temperature (rectal thermistor) will be continuously monitored 
and recorded. Subjects will be removed from the hot bath immediately if either core temperature reaches 
39.5°C or the subjects experience any symptoms of heat -related illness. All symptoms s ubside upon lowering 
core temperature. Ice packs will be on hand if rapid cooling is necessary (see Rapid Cooling SOP). Heart rate 
will also be continuously monitored and recorded throughout heating. If HR increases > 60 beats/min above 
resting or increase s > 20 beat/min with a [ADDRESS_602964].  
 
Rectal temperature probes:   
 
The use of rectal probes to measure core temperature carries minimal ri sk. The primary risk is of damage to 
the lining of the rectum; however, this risk is very slight as we use a flexible thermistor that is designed for this 
Updated 06/30 /[ADDRESS_602965] not washing their hands properly or exposure by [CONTACT_470465] a poorly 
cleaned probe. We will use clean, sterile disposable probes to minimize this risk. The risk of infection is similar 
to that of having a bowel movement, and is considered minimal ( similar to daily experience). There is also the 
risk of embarrassment. The approach is typi[INVESTIGATOR_470451], and the investigative team is 
professional in regard to their treatment of the subjects.  
 
Recruitment:  
 
Participants will be recruited for this study through  IRB-approved  flyers posted at the University of Kansas 
Medical Center, in the community, and through electronic communications via websites and email. The study 
team will also utilize the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_335032]/Frontiers Research Participant Registry after approval from the Data 
Request Committee (DRC). Individual mailings and phone calls will be made to applicable subjects from the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_193034]/Frontiers Research Participant Registry.  
 
Vulnerable Populations:  
 
The recruitment plan will not include any of the vulnerable groups below, exc ept possible students or 
employees of the University or Health System:  
I. Cognitively or decisionally impaired individuals  
II. Children  
III. Pregnant women  
IV. Prisoners  
V. Students and/or employees: While our study does not specifically seek to recruit this subgroup, 
it is not outside the realm of possibility that students or employees may contact [CONTACT_470466][INVESTIGATOR_335032]/Frontiers research registry.  
 
Assessment of Subject Safet y and Development of a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan : 
 
Nursing and study staff will continually monitor participants for adverse events.   Any adverse ev ent will be 
immediately reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_470452] . 
This procedure will be scheduled when a CTSU safety monitor is available. The Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_470453] 5  subjects are enrolled. If a trend of adverse events related to heat -related 
illness occurs, the study will pause or stop until the safety issue is assessed and addressed by [CONTACT_3476].  
 
Definition of Adverse Experiences:   
 
Adverse events are defined a s any untoward medical occurrence in study participants or others, which does 
not necessarily have to be a causal relationship with the study treatment.   The seriousness of the adverse 
event will be determined using the National Cancer Institute Common Ter minology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) v3.0,95 Adverse events (AE) will be reported if they are reported by [CONTACT_470467] a noticeably different experience than is typi[INVESTIGATOR_470454] (CTCAE v3 Grade 1 -
2) Serious adverse events (SAE) will be deemed those AEs significant enough to interfere with activities of 
daily living (CTCAE v3 Grade 3 -5). An adverse event in any category rated 3 or greater according to CTCAE 
v3.0, will result in immediate termination of the procedure.

 Expected Adverse Experiences:   
 
Expected adverse experiences include  potential bruising and soreness at the site of blood draw.  
 
Data Protection:  
 
All data will be deidentified by [CONTACT_403853] a random number that will unable to be traced to identity or 
demographic data.  All data will be stored in a database on the PI’s password protected, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470455] a 
password protected spreadsheet.  This computer is housed in a locked hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470456].   
 
Objectives  
 
The mai n objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_470457].  The translation of enhanced endothelial arterial distensibility into 
improved oxygen consumption, or VO 2max, has yet to be studied.  If indeed, the benefits of heat therapy do 
translate into better cardiovascular health, the implications of this would be far reaching for mil lions of people 
who suffer from cardiovascular disease throughout the world.  
The current pi[INVESTIGATOR_470458].  However, the findings of this stu dy will hopefully set the framework for hot 
water therapy in patients with NYHA Class II -III heart failure in a future study.  The benefits in these patients 
may not only be in VO 2max and biomarker measurements of cardiac function improvements, but also i n 
activities of daily living.  This would have a very meaningful impact on society due to the large and ever -
increasing number of patients with heart failure.  Currently the National Institute of Health recognizes heart 
failure as major public health probl em with a prevalence over 5.[ADDRESS_602966] amatically increase.  However, it is necessary to continue the pursuit of 
understanding heat therapy and the implications in patients with cardiovascular disease.  Unlike other morbid 
disease processes, heart failure can often be prevented and treated such  that patients live higher quality lives.  
This in turn, allows freedom from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470459].  Utilizing the human body’s own 
molecular mechanisms to combat cardiovascular disease is the ideal prevention and therapeutic strategy.  We 
believe heat therapy will be an important steppi[INVESTIGATOR_470460].

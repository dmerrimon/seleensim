Terms Definition of terms
Baseline Observed values/findings which are regarded as the observed starting point for 
comparison. 
Enroll To register or enter into a clinical trial.  NOTE: Once a subject has been 
enrolled, the clinical trial protocol applies to the subject. 
Intervention The drug, therapy or process under investigation in a clinical study that is 
believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study (e.g., health -
related quality of life, efficacy, safety, pharmacoeconomics). 
Investigational 
periodPeriod of time where major interests of protocol objectives are observed, and 
where the test drug or comparative drug (sometimes without randomization) is 
usually given to a subject, and continues until the last assessment after 
completing administration of the test drug or comparative drug.
Screening period Period of time before entering the investigational period, usua lly from the time 
of starting a subject signing consent until just before the test drug or 
comparative drug (sometimes without randomization) is given to a subject .
Randomization The process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups usin g an 
element of chance to determine assignments in order to reduce bias.
Screening A process of active consideration of potential subjects for enrollment in a trial.
Screen failure Potential subject who did not meet one or more criteria required for 
participation in a trial.
Study period Period of time from the first site initiation date to the last site completing the 
study.
Variable Any quantity that varies; any attribute, phenomenon or event that can have

Sponsor:  Astellas Medical Affairs, Americas Protocol Number: IDTX -MA-3004
Name [CONTACT_26323]: 
Tacrolimus extended -release (Astagraf XL®)Phase of Development:  4
Title of  Study:  ASTOUND
Astagraf XL®to Understa nd the Impact of Immunosuppression on De Novo DSA Development and 
Chronic Immune Activation in Kidney Transplantation 
Planned Study Period: 
From 1Q FY20 16to 3Q FY2019
Study Objective(s): 
Primary Objective:   
Compare the incidence of a two -part composite endpoint consisting of de novo donor specific 
antibody (DSA) formation or a designation of “immune activation (IA)” on peripheral blood 
molecular profiling in patients maintained on twice daily, immediate -release tacrolimus 
versus those maintained on Astagraf XL®in the first two years post -transplant.
Secondary Objectives:
To assess the risk factors for each of the following outcomes: DSA formation ;,IA;transplant 
glomerulopathy (TG); acute and chronic forms of antibody -mediated rejection ( ABMR ); 
C1q-binding DSA; HLA -DQ DSA; DSA IgG 3isotype; requirement for and type of antibody 
reduction required; various threshold levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) 
(less than 30, 40, and 50 mL/min/1.73 m2); and the four components of the traditional

Planned Total Number of Study Centers and Location(s):  
Approximately 25 -30 centers
US
Study Population:  
Living or deceased donor kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 16 to 70years of age. 
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled / Randomized:  
550 patients to be enrolled.
Study Design Overview:  
This is an exploratory, two year, prospective, randomized, multi- center, open -label trial examining 
long-term kidney transplant outcomes through the use of an adaptive design and a two -part, 
composite surrogate endpoint.  Specifically, it is designed to co mpare the effects of twice daily, 
immediate -release tacrolimus and once daily Astagraf XL on DSA formation and the development of 
a peripheral blood molecular profile indicating the presence of immune activation (IA) in de novo 
kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_880032].  For the purposes of 
this study, IA will be defined as a positive molecular signature [CONTACT_880164] v2.0 molecular assay 
(Transplant Genomics, Inc., Pleasanton, CA) in all patients.
Patients will b e screened prior to surgery and randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1229883] 
immunosuppression maintenance regimen also consisting of corticosteroids (complete steroid 
avoida nce not allowed –steroid taper and withdrawal permitted if part of institutional protocol) and 
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (or Myfortic® equivalent). Investigators are encouraged to start 
subjects on the randomized study treatment (immediate release tacro limus or Astagraf XL) within 48 
hours of transplantation (pre -transplant administration of study treatment is not allowed). However, if 
medically indicated per the treating physician’s discretion, initiation of study treatment may be 
delayed for up to seve n days post -transplant. 
IF medically indicated, subjects who are unable to tolerate oral administration of their assigned study 
drug may be administered tacrolimus via an alternative route (for Astagraf XL treatment arm: 
intravenous [IV] tacrolimus; for i mmediate release tacrolimus: IV tacrolimus or nasogastric tube 
[NGT]) for up to seven consecutive days. Dosing via alternative routes should be discontinued as 
soon as the subject can tolerate oral administration, and is not allowed for more than seven 
consecutive days. Please see Section 5.1.1 and 4.1for further details regarding non -oral 
administration of tacrolimus.  
Sponsor: APGD, Medical Affairs, Americas ISN/Protocol IDTX -MA-[ADDRESS_1229884] prior assumptions 
relating to the true incidence rate of DSA formation. To apply the rule, the incidence rate of the 
primary endpoint in the control group will be examined once 50% of contr ol patients have completed 
one year of therapy. Early termination of the study, or extension to a second year, will be predicated 
on this assessment (see Formal Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_880033]).
Induction therapy is required for all participants, and will be adminis tered (dosing, type of agent) per 
center protocol.  Intravenous corticosteroids will be administered prior to revascularization as part of 
the initial induction regimen, with dose and duration of therapy also determined by [CONTACT_880111]’s standard protocol.  Thereafter, patients will be followed for up to [ADDRESS_1229885] available to them through normal dispensing mechanisms.  
Astagraf XL will be supplied by [CONTACT_880112].
Initial pre -transplant cross -matching (XM) will be performed per local protocol.  Initial XM serum 
will be collected and stored centrally to facilitate the later assessment of pre -formed antibody on an as 
needed basis.  Thereafter, antibody screening and molecular phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_509887] a 
central lab at one month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 24 months.  Antibody status, 
including HLA -DSA isotype and C1q- binding DSA status, will also be recorded when measured 
locally during the course of clinical care. 
For central laboratory analysis, initial FlowPRA®(One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA) screening will be 
used to test for the presence of anti -HLA antibodies.  Once identified, single antigen testing will be 
used to identify DSA specificity with an MFI greater than or approaching [ADDRESS_1229886] of independent, qualified 
HLA Lab Directors will determine positivity based on relevant clinical data.  In samples that meet 
threshold criteria for DSA positivity, additional classificat ion will be performed to determine the 
degree of antibody strength.  By [CONTACT_746] a single dilution (1:16) of DSA -containing samples, the 
alloimmune response can be further elucidated [Tambur et al, 2015].  Samples in which MFI 
disappears (becomes < 1000 MFI) will be regarded as “weak.”  Samples increasing to > 10,000 MFI 
upon dilution will be regarded as having significant prozone and will be regarded as “strong.”  
Samples which may increase or decrease, but nevertheless remain between 1000 and 10,000 MFI will 
be regarded as “moderate.”  In certain cases, samples with evidence of fluorescence that are 
nevertheless below MFI criteria for DSA positivity will also be subject to dilution.  Samples 
increasing to above threshold criteria following dilution will be regarded as positive and assumed to 
be under the influence of a prozone effect that impairs antibody detection.  For statistical purposes, 
the DSA with the highest MFI level obtained during the course of the study will be used for statistical 
comparison s between groups.  However, the strongest antibody observed at each HLA -locus will be 
reported separately and tracked for patients who are DSA positive [Tambur et al, 2015].  In all cases, 
positive DSA and/or molecular testing results will be communicated to the patient’s treating physician 
when available (DSA) or at the end of study (molecular testing). Testing will be performed in batches. 
De-identified typi[INVESTIGATOR_189032] (donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) will be requested from the participating centers to 
inform the cen tral laboratory testing. De- identified results of recent local pre- transplant DSA testing 
(if performed per SOC) will also be requested to facilitate interpretation of central DSA testing 
results.

clinical care.  De -identified copi[INVESTIGATOR_880034]. For

absent using the Trugraf™ v2.0 molecular assay.  For the purposes of the study, a negative 
designation (Trugraf TX Normal) will be referred to as Immune Quiescence (IQ).  Due to operating 
characteristics of the assay, a positive designation will be considered evidence of Immune Activation 
(IA) in all patients.
The modified Full Analysis Set (m FAS)will be used for the primary endpoint analysis.
Secondary:
The assessment and comparison of the incidence of DSA between trea tment groups will rely on the 
binary variable of DSA positivity at a threshold criteria approaching an MFI of 1000.  Comparisons of 
the cohorts with respect to the various molecular designations as well as correlating the results with 
DSA will rely on the categorical (binary) variable of positivity using the TrugrafTMv2.0 molecular 
assay. 
Comparisons between treatment cohorts regarding incidence will rely upon assessments for each of 
the following results at any point in the study:
DSA
IA)
TG
Acute and chronic forms of ABMR 
C1q-binding DSA
HLA -DQ DSA
DSA IgG 3isotype

Sample Size Justification: 
The sample size for this study was determined based upon a comparison of the rate of the two -part 
composite endpoint in the Astagraf XL group compared to the immediate -release tacrolimus group.  
Assuming a rate of 20% would be o bserved for the immediate -release tacrolimus group compared to a 
rate of 10% for the Astagraf XL group, 220 subjects per group are needed to achieve an 80% power to 
detect a difference between Astagraf XL and immediate -release tacrolimus with a two -sided a lpha 
level of 0.05.  The study will enroll 275 subjects/group (550 total) to allow for 20% dropout.
Efficacy:  
The analysis of efficacy will be conducted using the m FAS.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is theincidence of any one of the following in the first two years post -
transplant: 
DSA formation 
IA
The primary endpoint will be analyzed at a single time point per Section 7.4.1
The incidence of the primary endpoint will be summarized by [CONTACT_880120].  Differences between treatment groups will be analyzed using logistic regression and 
controlled using pre -defined covariates.
For subjects with missing or incomplete endpoint data who did not permanently switch therapy or 
were discontinued from the study prior to DSA/IA event (who are lost to follow up, or those who 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_880041] ), negative DSA/IA values will be imputed unles s there is an otherwise positive 
result.  
The hypothesis for comparison is as follows:
H0: The probability of incidence for the primary endpoint is the same between patients 
receiving Astagraf XL and patients receiving immediate -release tacrolimus.
H1: The probability of incidence for the primary endpoint is not the same between patients 
receiving Astagraf XL and immediate -release tacrolimus.
Hypothesis testing will be performed using a two -sided test with a 0.05 significance level.  The 95% 
confidence int erval for the odds ratio of the primary endpoint between Astagraf XL and twice daily 
tacrolimus will be included . 
Analyses of treatment group differences for secondary endpoints will be evaluated by [CONTACT_880121].  The scope of these analyses will incl ude the following: DSA formation, IA ,TG, acute and 
chronic forms of ABMR, C1q- binding DSA, HLA -DQ DSA, DSA IgG 3isotype, the requirement for 
antibody reduction therapy, chronic graft dysfunction, graft loss, local BPAR, mortality, loss to 
follow -up, ordin al anti body strength, MFI score, histopathology assessments, and tacrolimus trough 
levels.

1.1 Back ground
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_880045] r rates of acute rejection and short- term improvements in patient and graft 
survival, the rate of late allograft loss following kidney transplantation has remained 
unchanged for more than 30 y ears [Lamb et al, 2011; Kaneku and Terasaki, 2006].  During 
thistime, chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) became recognized as the major cause of late 
kidney  allograft failure [Loupy  et al, 2009; Seron & Moreso, 2007; M yers et al, 1984] and 
numerous attempts were made to correlate the progressive fibrosis and vascular injury  seen 
on biopsy  with the use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI s) [Nankivell et al, 2003].  However, 
over the past three decades, the link between chronic nephrotoxicity  and the use of CNIs has 
proven largely  elusive.  For example, in reports examining independent risk factors for 
chronic histological change, low CNI levels were often cited [Shihab et al, 2008; Ekberg, 
Griny o, et al, 2007; Naesens et al, 2007; Nankivell et al, 2004; Seron et al, 2002].  Similarly , 
when investigators have attempted to min imize, avoid, or withdraw the use of tacrolimus 
during the course of a randomized clinical trial, they  have routinel y been confronted with 
inferior outcomes in the reduced tacrolimus/tacrolimus avoidance arms [de Sandes -Frietas et 
al, 2015; Hricik et al, 2 015; Flechner et al, 2011; Weir et al, 2011; Durrbach et al, 2010; 
Vincenti et al, 2010; Lebranchu et al, 2009; Dean et al, 2008; Ekberg, Tedesco -Silva, et al, 
2007; Srinvias et al, 2007; Ciancio et al, 2006; L arson et al, 2006; Medez et al, 2005; Meier -
Kreische et al, 2005; Halloran, 2000; Andoh et al, 1996].
Late allograft injury  as evidenced by  [CONTACT_60142] -to-severe arteriolar h yalinosis (a traditional 
hallmark of CNI nephrotoxicity ) is found to a similar extent in patients never exposed to 
CNIs at 5 y ears [Stegall et al, 2011].  L ikewise, when 1317 cases of allograft loss were 
re-examined by  [CONTACT_26131]-Zoghby  [INVESTIGATOR_20040], alloimmunity  was found to be the leading cause 
of kidney  graft failure, prompting a reclassification of all biopsies with an original diagnosi s 
of idiopathic interstitial fibrosis or CNI  toxicity  [2009].  There have also been several recent 
studies in which biopsies were performed in the setting of new -onset graft dysfunction.  In 
the Deterioration of Kidney Allograft (DeKAF) Trial, the risk of graft failure was unrelated 
to immunosuppression and actuall y intensified in patients presenting with DSA.  I n fact, the 
severit y of clinical injury strongl y correlated with the magnitude of antibody response 
[Gaston et al, 2010].  I n another large stud y, the Edmonton group demonstrated that the 
majority of kidney  failures were not attributable to CNI  use, but rather, rejection, non-
adherence, and the presence of alloantibod y.  In this study  and others, the incidence of 
allograft d ysfunction hastened b y the presence of antibody  increased steadily  over time, 
becoming more noticeable with increasing time from transplant [Wiebe et al, 2015; Sellares 
et al, 2012].   
Indeed, the link between subclinical immune -mediated graft injury  and progressive
worsening of g raft function is now firmly  established.  However, given that the appearance of 
chronic renal allograft injury  may  also take y ears to manifest, any  randomized trial involving 
new forms of therap y and utilizing this parameter as an endpoint may  still be dif ficult to 
conduct from a practical standpoint [Stegall et al, 2015].  For this reason, the identification of

v2.1, Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 2 Astellas Page 35of 124an appropriate surrogate endpoint becomes an important consideration.  In the context of 
long-term investigations, a surrogate offers a theoretical advantage as a study  endpoint in lieu 
of a parameter such as graft loss; the primary  benefit being to decrease the interval between 
therapeutic intervention and the ability  to determine efficacy  [Stegall et al, 2015].  
Unfortunatel y, man y prospective biom arkers are relatively  non- specific, poorly -correlated, or 
may be causally  influenced by  a disease process without, itself, influencing the desired 
clinical outcome [Stegall et al, 2015; Fleming, 2005].  Therefore, in order to establish that the 
effect of a particular intervention on a clinical efficacy  endpoint is reliabl y predicted b y the 
effect of that intervention on a surrogate, Prentice identified two conditions that, if 
satisfactoril y validated, would be sufficient to authenticate any proposed biomarker as an 
appropriate surrogate.  First and foremost, the biological marker must be correlated with the 
clinical endpoint –in this case, graft failure.  Secondly , it must fully  capture the net effect of 
an intervention (immunosuppression) on the clinical e fficacy  endpoint [Prentice, 1989].
Histologic changes, such as transplant glomerulopathy  (TG) or subclinical inflammation, are 
moderatel y good predictors of subsequent graft loss [I ssa et al, 2008; Cosio et al, 2005].  
Patients with graft fibrosis, especia lly with inflammatory  cell infiltrates, have worse 
outcomes and return to dialy sis and/or undergo repeat transplantation with greater frequency .  
Likewise, subclinical histologic abnormalities found only  on protocol biopsies have been 
associated with the d evelopment of chronic injury  and decreased renal function over time 
[Loupy  et al, 2009; Moreso et al, 2006; Nankivell et al, 2004; Shishido et al, 2003; Nankivell 
et al, 2001; Kirk et al, 1999; Rush et al, 1994].  
While some transplant centers routinely  perform protocol biopsies as part of their standard of 
care (SOC), others do not, despi[INVESTIGATOR_880046] y graft loss.  For this 
reason, a search for molecular biomarkers which can predict these phenomenon has been 
undertaken in the allograft, the urine, and the blood [El Ters et al, 2013; Li et al, 2013; Loupy 
et al, 2009; Kee et al, 2006; Moreso et al, 2006; Nankivell et al, 2004; Shishido et al, 2003; 
Nankivell et al, 2001; Kirk et al, 1999 ],the latter two of which having been proposed as a 
minimally  invasive way  to diagnose and monitor subclinical rejection, to optimize and 
personalize immunosuppression decisions, and as a means to poten tially  reduce the incidence 
of chronic rejection, which, in turn, could lead to significantl y improved graft survival and 
function over the long- term.  I n fact, the need to complement histopathological grading with 
an interpretation of accompany ing molecular signals was recentl y identified at the 2013 
Banff Conference on Allograft Pathology [Haas et al, 2014].  However, up to now, relativel y 
few individual molecular transcripts have been shown to correlate with chronic injury .  
Interestingly , an approach ex amining global genomic gene expression profiling in the 
peripheral blood was recently  described.  Using multiple, three -way classifier tools to 
validate [ADDRESS_1229905] 
identified a variet y ofmolecular signatures in the peripheral blood.  Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_880047] a 
sensitivity  ranging from 82% to 100%, a specificity  of 76% to 95%, a positive predictive 
value of 76% to 95%, and a negative predictive value of 79% to 100% [Kurian et al, 2014].  
Sponsor: APGD, Medical Affairs, Americas ISN/Protocol IDTX -MA-[ADDRESS_1229906] to chronic, alloimmune injury  [Einecke et al, 2009; Sis 
et al, 2007].  Further strengthening its role as a surrogate, DSA appears to ac t late in the 
biological injury  pathway , and based on clinical insight and empi[INVESTIGATOR_33727], is likel y the 
predominant mechanism precipi[INVESTIGATOR_880048], immune -mediated graft injury [Jordan & Vo, 
2014; L oupy  et al, 2012].  I n this regard, studies examining the impact of DSA on transplant 
outcomes allude to a quantitative epi[INVESTIGATOR_880049] [Marfo et al, 2014; 
Alachkar et al, 2012; Zachary  & Reinsmoen, 2011; Lefaucheur et al, 2010].  Additionally , 
newer reports are also beginning to link ant ibody  formation to non-adherence [Wiebe et al, 
2015; Wiebe et al, 2012].  The “real world” evidence linking DSA to at least two primary  
clinical outcome measures [antibody -mediated rejection (ABMR) and graft survival] has 
been extensive as well as consiste nt.  For example, DSA dramaticall y accelerates the 
progression of histological lesions [Hill et al, 2011], is independently  associated with TG 
[Issa et al, 2008; Gloor et al, 2007], and is a strong predictor of both ABMR and graft failure 
[Guidicelli et al , 2015; Wiebe et al, 2015; DeVos et al, 2014; Kim et al, 2014; Banasik et al, 
2013; Everly  et al, 2013; Freitas et al, 2013; DeVos et al, 2012; Ginevri et al, 2012; Sellares 
et al, 2012; Wiebe et al, 2012; Willicombe et al, 2012; Cooper et al, 2011; Ntokou et al, 
2011; Gaston et al, 2010; El- Zoghby [CONTACT_2297], 2009; Hidalgo et al, 2009; Lachmann et al, 2009; 
Mao et al, 2007; Cardarelli et al, 2005; Campos et al, 2006; Zhang et al, 2005].  I t is also 
highl y pragmatic that the measurement of DSA is relativel y non -invasive and unlike biopsy , 
can be performed sequentially  in the same patient. 
Recent publications describe that the major causes for de novo development of DSA relate 
primarily  to medication non -adherence and immunosuppression minimization or elimination
protocols [Matas & Gaston, 2015; Nickerson & Rush, 2015; Jordan & Vo, 2014; I ssa et al, 
2013].  Therefore, strategies which improve adherence and optimize exposure to 
immunosuppression should be evaluated to reduce the consequences of alloimmune -mediated 
injury .  Astagraf XL® is an oral, extended- release formulation of tacrolimus developed to 
enable a once daily  dosing regimen with a similar safet y and efficacy profile as Prograf®.  
Available in the European Union as Advagraf® since 2007, its decreased int rapatient 
variability  (IPV) [Stifft et al, 2014; Kurnatowska et al, 2011; Wu et al, 2011] and flatter 
kinetics [van Hooff et al, 2012; Alloway  et al, 2011] should ensure a more consistent 
immunosuppression exposure over the long- term and the once daily  dosing has been

Eberlin et al, 2013; Ku ypers et al, 2013].  Given the negative impact of IPV on kidney  
transplant outcomes [Sapir -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_880050], 2014; Pollock -Barziv et al, 2010] and the 
association of non -adherence with DSA production [Wiebe et al, 2015; Wiebe et al, 2012],

surrogates of chronic immune -mediated graft loss: DSA and real- time molecular profiling 
from individual patient, peripheral blood samples.  Both components will be combined as 
part of a two- part composite endpoint designed to test the hy pothesis that the consistency  of 
immunosuppression with Astagraf XL decreases the development of DSA and reduces the 
molecular signature [CONTACT_880165] (IA).  Accordingl y, this study will perform tests of 
correlation between DSA and peripheral blood molecular profiling as well as correlate each 
with information gained from SOC or institutional-derived protocol biopsies.  In the cours e 
of this study , patients in the control arm will receive immediate- release formulations of 
tacrolimus in accordance with local SOC dispensing practices, thus preserving the real -world 
conditions in which the patient could receive an y manufacturer’s approv ed product.  In this 
manner, it is hoped that this research will improve the understanding of chronic alloimmune 
injury  and provide greater insight into how tacrolimus exposure impacts DSA production.
1.2 Clinical Data
1.2.1 Clinical Summary
Pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus (Prograf) in Humans
Following oral administration, tacrolimus is generally  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_638262] ( tmaxof 
approximately  1.5 hours).  The mean oral bioavailability  is low, approximately  20% to 25%, 
with a large amount of variation between individuals.  Th e drug binds strongl y to 
erythrocy tes resulting in the distribution ratio of whole blood/plasma concentrations of 
tacrolimus of approximately  20:1. In plasma, the drug is highl y bound to plasma proteins 
(>98.8%), mainly  to serum albumin and alpha -1-acid g lycoprotein.  Tacrolimus is also 
extensively  distributed in the body  as indicated by  a large steady  state volume of distribution.
Systemicall y available tacrolimus is cleared b y hepatic metabolism, specifically , from 
isoforms of the CYP3A system, a fact th at contributes to a significant first pass effect.  
Pre-systemic metabolism by  [CONTACT_880123]3A and the ATP- binding cassette 
transporter protein (ABC -transporter), p -glycoprotein, has also been demonstrated and is 
considered responsible for the limited oral bioavailability of tacrolimus.
Tacrolimus is primarily  eliminated in the bile; urinary  excretion amounts to < 2% of the dose 
and < 1% as unchanged drug.
As tacrolimus is metabolized via CYP3A sy stem enzy mes, concomitant use of substances 
known to inhibit or induce CYP3A sy stem enz ymes may  influence the metabolism of 
tacrolimus and thereb y increase or decrease blood levels.  Tacrolimus, itself, is an inhibitor of 
CYP3A4; thus, concomitant use of tacrolimus with other drugs known to be metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4- dependent pathway s may , in turn, affect the metabolism of such drugs (e.g., 
cortisone, testosterone).  Tacrolimus is also extensively  bound to plasma proteins; therefore, 
Sponsor: APGD, Medical Affairs, Americas ISN/Protocol IDTX -MA-[ADDRESS_1229908] high affinity  for plasma prote ins should be 
considered (e.g., NSAIDs, oral anticoagulants or oral antidiabetics).
Pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus (Astagraf XL/Advagraf) in Humans
Biopharmaceutics in Healthy Volunteers
Absorption is variable and the mean oral bioavailability of tacrolimus (investigated with the 
Prograf formulation) is in the range of 20% to 25% (individual range in adult patients of 6% 
to 43%).  The oral bioavailability  of tacrolimus for Advagraf or Prograf was approximately  
35% lower in the evening relative to morning ad ministration.  Bioavailability was also 
reduced when Advagraf or Prograf capsules were administered with, or up to, 1.[ADDRESS_1229909] 2 weeks after transpla ntation in de 
novo kidney  transplant patients.  The data for all patients who completed the study  as planned 
and who provided 4 complete blood concentration -time profiles (day  1, day 3, day  7, and day  
14) without major protocol deviations or factors which could influence the pharmacokinetic 
evaluations showed that the sy stemic exposure to tacrolimus (ln[ AUC 24]) on day  1 was 
approximately  16% lower for Advagraf than for Prograf, although the mean total daily  dose 
(mg/kg) was approximately  the same.  On day s 3, [ADDRESS_1229910]( AUC 24) for Advagraf was 
5%, 22% and 22% higher than that for Prograf, with the 90% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for 
ln(AUC 24) being outside the equivalence range of 80% to 125%.
However, the mean total daily  doses (mg/kg) of Advagraf were approximately  the same as 
the corresponding mean Prograf doses at the times of the day  1, day  3, and day  [ADDRESS_1229911] that systemic exposure is similar b y day 3.
Across all studies where stable kidney , liver, and heart transplant recipi [INVESTIGATOR_880051] y Advagraf on a 1:1 (mg:mg) total daily dose basis, the 
geometric mean ratios of sy stemic exposure of tacrolimus (Advagraf:Prograf) ranged from
88.8% to 100.9%.  The 90% CI s across these studies were all contained within the 
equivalence limits of 80% to 125%.

of the line of best fit was also similar for both Advagraf and Prograf, indicating that for 
therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), the same target trough level range is applicable for both 
formulations.

graft survival and prev ention of biopsy -proven acute rejection (BPAR).  This was seen at 
3years post -transplant in patients for the phase 3 de novo studies (Studies FG -506E-12-03 
and FG -506E-11 -03) from the Advagraf treatment group who were included in the long -term 
follow -up S tudy FG-506-14-02.
Overall Safety Profile
The safet y profile of Prograf has been established worldwide in over 100,000 transplant 
patients treated since its introduction in 1993.  Clinically important events include 
impairment of renal function, abnormal g lucose metabolism, and neurological disorders. 
Many  of the adverse drug reactions are reversible and/or responded to dose reduction. 
Transplant patients on immunosuppressive therap y are also known to be at increased risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_118281] -transplant ly mphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies.  This risk is 
considered to be related to the overall immunosuppressive burden.
The safet y of Advagraf was evaluated in 4201 transplant patients in 16 phase 2/3 studies, of 
who 2801 received Advagraf.
The ad verse events observed following administration of Advagraf in the three large phase 
3/3b studies in de novo kidney  transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (Study  02-0- 158, Study FG -506E-12-03 
and Study PMR -EC-1210 [OSAKA]), and in the two phase 2 pharmacokinetic studies in de 
novo kidney  (Study  FG-506E-12 -01) transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_880055]: APGD, Medical Affairs, Americas ISN/Protocol IDTX -MA-[ADDRESS_1229914] a clinical 
concern were identified, with Advagraf having a similar safet y profile to that o f Prograf, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_880056].
The safet y profile of Advagraf and Prograf were also similar in stable kidney, liver, and heart 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_880057] y Prograf to once dail y Advagraf.
1.2.3 Whole Blood Trough Concentrations Can Be Used to Target the Same Systemic 
Exposure for Both Prograf and Astagraf
Tacrolimus is an active substance with a narrow therapeutic index (NTI).  Like other NTI 
drugs, tacrolimus requires regular monitoring to establish and maintain appropriate drug 
exposure.  Immunosuppressive therapy  with once daily  tacrolimus is usually  initiated at a 
dose between 0.1 mg/kg per day  and 0.3 mg/kg per day  in orall y divided doses.  Subsequent 
doses are adjusted on the basis of clinical signs aid ed by  [CONTACT_880124].  To ensure that appropriate systemic exposure is achieved, the 
prevailing practice is to conduct TDM based on the trough whole blood concentrations 
(Cmin).  Although tacrolimus systemic exposure (AUC) is the critical parameter for both 
safet y and efficacy in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] [Kuypers et al, 2004; Undre et al, 1999], AUC 
monitoring is not feasible in clinical practice.  For this reason, C min(i.e., trough 
concentration) is used as a surrogate for overall exposure.  Moreover, as shown in Figure 1, 
the relationship between C minand AUC is the same for both Prograf and Astagra f XL.  
Therefore , for both formulations, the established trough concentration goals can be used to 
target the same s ystemic exposure level.  I t is not known whether this is the case for other 
formulations.

Prograf (tacrolimus BID) in heart transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_880058], 2011.
1.2.[ADDRESS_1229915] shown that with increasing tacrolimus exposure, the decreased risk of 
acute rejection is offset by a potential for increased risk of toxicity  and infection [(Cockfield 
et al, 2014; Kuy pers et al, 2004) reviewed in (Staatz & Tett, 2004)].  Additional studies have 

Sponsor: APGD, Medical Affairs, Americas ISN/Protocol IDTX -MA-[ADDRESS_1229916], short -term changes in tacrolimus exposure may  result in adverse clinical 
outcomes.  These studies, explained in greater detail below, demonstrated: 
●A significantly  (26.9%) lower AUC in patients who experienced acute rejection at 
day2/[ADDRESS_1229917]-kidney  transplant, compared with those who remained rejection -free 
(157 ng∙h/mL vs. 215 ng∙h/mL , P = 0.007) [Undre et al, 1999];
●Increased risk of BPAR in patients with AUC < 150 ng∙h/mL at day  [ADDRESS_1229918] -kidney  
transplant in comparison to those above this threshold [Kuy pers et al, 2004];
●A 7.2% increased risk of acute rejection w ith every  1ng/mL decrease in tacrolimus 
trough concentration within the first 6 months following kidney  transplant; an additional 
23% increased risk of ac ute rejection with every  1ng/mL decrease in trough between 
3and 6 months [I srani et al, 2013];
●Significantl y increased incidence of BPAR in de novo kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_880059] -dose tacrolimus ER compared with those receiving standard- dose 
tacrolimus ER (actual tac rolimus exposure differed by  30% to 40%) [Cockfield et al, 
2014];
●Significantl y higher mean AUC in de novo kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_880060]  7 and week 6, compared with those who remained infection -free (197.4 
± 70.5 ng∙h/mL vs. 160.5 ± 47.9 ng∙h/mL, P = 0.01 at day  7; 177.5 ± 28.3 ng∙h/mL vs. 
149.2 ± 31.3 ng∙h/mL, P = 0.02 at week 6) [Kuy pers et al, 2004].
Based on the AUCs associated with these adverse events, it appears that risk of acute 
rejection and infection increased outside of t he range of 150 –177ng∙h/mL . 
Similar to the studies described above, the association between earl y acute rejection (within 
the first 6 months of transplantation) and decreased tacrolimus trough concentration was 
shown in a post hoc analysis of the prospec tive DeKAF stud y.  DeKAF was a landmark stud y 
that has shaped our understanding of post -transplantation immunosuppression and long -term 
kidney  transplant function.  The authors of this analy sis reported that for every  1 ng/mL  
decrease in tacrolimus trough concentration, a 7.2% increased risk of acute rejection within 
the first [ADDRESS_1229919] -transplant (P = 0.03).  Between months 3 and 6, 
when centers typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y reduce tacrolimus exposure to limit long-term side effects, there was 
an additional 23% increased risk of acute rejection with each 1 ng/mL decrease in tacrolimus 
trough level (P = 0.008) [Israni et al, 2013].  The latter result is especially  concerning, as 
stable patients are t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_880061] 3 months.
Togethe r, these studies show that small deviations in tacrolimus exposure places patients at 
increased risk of acute rejection and opportunistic infection, highlighting the fine balance 
between tacrolimus under - and overexposure.
1.2.5 Association Between the Potential for Adverse Clinical Outcomes and 
Increased Tacrolimus Exposure Variability
High IPV in tacrolimus concentration over time may put the patient at risk of over -or 
under -immunosuppression. Tacrolimus I PV has been assessed in several studies enrolling 
stabl e transplant patients, in which the coefficient of variation (CV) of tacrolimus trough

v2.1, Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 2 Astellas Page 42of 124concentration is consistently  calculated to be approximately  15%.  The following section 
describes stud y results suggesting that increased IPV is associated with adverse long-term 
(≥[ADDRESS_1229920] -transplant) clinical outcomes.
Study Details
Borra et al. reported that high tacrolimus I PV was associated with significantly  higher risk of 
graft failure at ≥ [ADDRESS_1229921] -transplant, compared with those with low IPV (P = 0.003).   IPV 
was calculated from a retrospective anal ysis of 6 –[ADDRESS_1229922] -transplant trough 
measurements in 297 kidney  transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  The median tacrolimus IPV in this study  
(14.9%) was used as the cut -off for high vs. low variability .  Notabl y, mean ± SD tacrolimus 
concentration was similar between patients who experienced or did not experience graft 
failure (6.9 ± 2.5 ng/mL vs. 7.4 ± 2.9 ng/mL, P = NS).  However, multivariate anal ysis 
showed that I PV was indeed an independent predictor of graft failu re [2010]. 
Another retrospective analy sis in kidney  transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_880062] a similar 
association between high variability and poor graft function.  I n a retrospective anal ysis of 
200 kidney  transplant patients, Makowski et al. reported a signi ficant association between 
high tacrolimus I PV, defined here as CV > 40%, and increased development of delay ed graft 
function and diminished renal function [2013].
Pollock -Barziv et al. reported that increased standard deviation of tacrolimus (TacSD) was an 
independent predictor of acute rejection at ≥ [ADDRESS_1229923] -transplant.  I n this retrospective 
analysis of 144 adolescent heart, kidney , liver, or lung transplant patients, TacSD was 
calculated from trough level measurements since transplant.  In recipi [INVESTIGATOR_880063] < [ADDRESS_1229924] -transplant, graft survival was significantl y better than in those with 
TacSD > 2 [ Figure 2]. Moreover, each 1-point increase in TacSD > 2 of tacrolimus trough 
was associated with a 58% increase in risk of graft loss (P = 0.003) [2010].

v2.1, Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 2 Astellas Page 43of 1241.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
As with other potent immunosuppressive agents, patients receiving tacrolimus are at an 
increased risk for infections (viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoal).  L ikewise, the course of 
pre-existing infections may  be aggravated.  Overall, infections have been reported frequentl y 
in patients being treated with tacrolimus.  Both generalized and localized infections can 
occur.  Patients receiving immunosu ppressive agents are also at an increased risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_119358], particularl y of the skin.  Benign as well as malignant neoplasms, 
including Epstein -Barr virus (EBV)- associated l ymphoproliferative disorders, have been 
reported in association with tacrolimus treatment.
Tacrolimus can result in renal function impairment in post-transplant patients due to its 
vasoconstrictive effect on renal vasculature.  Acute renal impairment, that is usually  
reversible, can result in high serum creatinine, hyperka lemia , decreased secretion of urea, and 
hyperuricemia.
Additional adverse reactions reported in patients receiving tacrolimus include allergic and 
anaph ylactoid reactions, ventricular h ypertroph y or hypertroph y of the septum (reported as 
cardiom yopathies; most cases have been reversible), encephalopathies (such as posterior 
reversible encephalopathy  syndrome [PRES], and pure red cell aplasia [PRCA]).  I n the case 
of PRCA, all patients reported risk factors such as parvovirus B19 infection, underly ing 
diseas e, or concomitant medications associated with PRCA.  Gastrointestinal perforation has 
also been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus, although all cases were considered a 
complication of transplant surgery  or accompanied by  [CONTACT_80601], diverticulum, or malignant 
neoplasm.  Tacrolimus may  prolong the QT interval and may  cause Torsade de Pointes. 
For additional information regarding possible adverse drug reactions related to tacrolimus or 
Astagraf XL, please refer to the Package Inserts (PIs) for Asta graf XL or the various 
immediate -release tacrolimus products.
1.4 Risk -Benefit Assessment
The research proposed herein compares two FDA -approved medications indicated for the 
prophy laxis of acute rejection in kidney  transplantation: 1) tacrolimus, extended- release 
(Astagraf XL) and 2) tacrolimus, immediate -release.  Tacrolimus (in thetwice dail y 
formulation of Prograf) has been extensivel y studied and used in clinical practice for man y 
years.  The safet y profile of tacrolimus has been well -established.  The use of tacrolimus in 
the current study  is consistent with the recommendations described in the approved package 
inserts, and as such, is not expected to shift the known risk -benefit profile in the transplant 
population under study .  Clinical studies have con firmed that Astagraf XL is as efficacious as 
Prograf, with a similar safety  profile [Trunecka et al, 2008; Fischer et al, 2007; Alloway , 
2005; Undre, 2005].

2.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale
2.2.1 Study Design
This is an exploratory , two y ear, prospective, randomized, multi- center, open- label trial 
examining long- term kidney  transplant outcomes through the use of an adaptive design and a 
two-part, composite surrogate endpoint.  Specifically , it is designed to co mpare the effects of 
twice dail y, immediate -release tacrolimus and once dail y Astagraf XL on DSA formation and 
the development of a peripheral blood molecular profile indicating the presence of immune 
activation (IA) in de novo kidney  transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_880064]. For the purposes of this study , IA will be defined as a positive molecular 
signature [CONTACT_880164]™ v.2.0 molecular assay  (Transplant Genomics, Inc., Pleasanton, 
CA) in all patients.
Patients will be screened prior to surgery and randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1229927] 
immunosuppression maintenance regimen also consisting of corticosteroids (complete steroid 
avoidance not allowed – steroid taper and withdrawal permitted if part of  institutional 
protocol) and m ycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (or My fortic® equivalent).  Investigators are 
encouraged to start subjects on the randomized study  treatment (immediate release tacrolimus 
or Astagraf XL) within 48 hours of transplantation (pre- transplant administration of study  
treatment is not allowed). However, if medicall y indicated, per the treating phy sician’s

not allowed for more than seven consecutive day s. Please see Section 5.1.[ADDRESS_1229928] prior 
assumptions relating to the true incidence rate of DSA formation (Section 7.1).  To appl y the
rule, the incidence rate of the primary  endpoint in the control group will be examined once 
50% of control patients have completed one year of therap y.  Earl y termination of the study, 
or extension to a second year, will be predicated on this assessment ( see Section 7.8.1 ).
Induction therap y is required for all participants, and will be administered (dosing, t ype of 
agent) per center protocol.  I ntravenous corticosteroids will be administered prior to 
revascularization as part of the initial induction regimen, with dose and duration of therap y 
also determined b y the participating transplant center’s standard protocol.  Thereafter, 
patients will be fo llowed for up to [ADDRESS_1229929] available to them through normal dispensing mechanisms.  Astagraf XL 
will be supplied by  [CONTACT_880126].
Initial pre-transplant cross- matching (XM) will be performed per local protocol.  I nitial XM 
serum will be collected and stored centrally  to facilitate the later assessment of pre -formed 
antibody  on an as needed basis.  Thereafter, antibody  screening and molecular phenot ypi[INVESTIGATOR_880065] b y a central lab at one month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 
and 24 months.  Antibody  status, includi ng HLA -DSA isoty pe and C1q- binding DSA status, 
will also be recorded when measured locall y during the course of clinical care. 
For central laboratory  analy sis, initial FlowPRA®(One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA) screening 
will be used to test for the presence of anti -HLA antibodies.  Once identified, single antigen 
testing will be used to identify  DSA specificit y with an MFI greater than or approaching 
[ADDRESS_1229930] of indepe ndent, qualified HLA Lab Directors will determine positivity  
based on relevant clinical data.  In samples that meet threshold criteria for DSA positivity , 
additional classification will be performed to determine the degree of antibody  strength.  By  
[CONTACT_343127] a single dilution (1:16) of DSA -containing samples, the alloimmune response can 
be further elucidated [Tambur et al, 2015].  Samples in which MFI disappears (becomes < 
1000 MFI) will be regarded as “weak.”  Samples increasing to > 10,000 MFI upon dilut ion 
will be regarded as having significant prozone and will be regarded as “strong.”  Samples 
which may  increase or decrease, but nevertheless remain between 1000 and 10,000 MFI will 
be regarded as “moderate.”  In certain cases, samples with evidence of fl uorescence that are 
nevertheless below MFI criteria for DSA positivity  will also be subject to dilution.  Samples 
increasing to above threshold criteria following dilution will be regarded as positive and

antibody  observed at each HLA -locus w ill be reported separatel y and tracked for patients 
who are DSA positive [Tambur et al, 2015].  I n all cases, positive DSA and/or molecular 
testing results will be communicated to the patient’s treating ph ysician when available (DSA) 
or at the end of stud y (molecular testing). T esting will be pe rformed in batches. De- identified 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_189032] (donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) will be requested from the participating centers to inform 
the central laboratory  testing. De -identified results of recent local pre -transplant D SA testing 
(if performed per SOC) will also be requested to facilitate interpretation of central DSA 
testing results. 
Follow -up visits will be performed quarterly  during the first year of follow -up to collect 
standard clinical data.  For follow -up bey ond the first y ear, urinary  protein, and tacrolimus 
trough concentrations obtained closest to targeted date of visit, per SOC, should be recorded. 
Thetwo closest serum creatinine levels to the study  visit, obtained at least one month apart, if 
performed per S OC, should also be recorded. Additionally , all local kidney  biopsy  results, 
AEs, and concomitant medications pertaining to AEs will be recorded.  At the terminal study  
visit at [ADDRESS_1229932] y ear will be 
detailed in the eCRF.  Final testing for DSA and molecular profiling will also be performed 
at the 24 month visit.
Pathology  results [hematoxy lin and eosin (H&E), light microscopy , and immunofluorescence] 
will be recorded in the eCRF when local kidney  biopsies are performed and interpreted during 
the course of clinical care.  De -identified copi[INVESTIGATOR_880066]. For purposes of data recording, substantiation b y local biopsy will be 
required for cases of suspected rejection.  For all participants who undergo at least one kidney  
biopsy  during the first year post -transplant (either for cause or per institutional pro tocol), the 
kidney  biops y performed closest to the 12 month visit (but no later than [ADDRESS_1229933] -
transplant) will be submitted for central pathological grading.  All biopsies that are submitted 
for central pathology  review will be evaluated and scored using the most recent version of the 
2007 Update to the Banff ’[ADDRESS_1229934] blinded to clinical results 
and patient identifiers [Solez et al, 2008]. 
2.2.2 Dose Rationale
In line with recommendations from the US PI , the initial dose of Astagraf XL  should be 
weight -based in order to avoid the possibility  of under -immunosuppression and ranged 
between 0.1 mg/kg/day  and 0.2 mg/kg/day  in the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_880067] [Silva et al, 2007; Kramer et al, 2010].  Fo r the purposes of the 
ASTOUND study, patients randomized to the Astagraf XL treatment arm will be 
administered an ini tial, weight -based dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day.  Dry  weight, or estimated 
dry weight, if dry  weight is not available, should be used to calculate the initial dose. 
Subsequent dosing should be based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability  in 
Sponsor: APGD, Medical Affairs, Americas ISN/Protocol IDTX -MA-[ADDRESS_1229935] in dose titration of Astagraf X L, it is important to note that the relationship between 
Cminand AUC has been validated for both Prograf and Astagraf XL, allowing practitioners to 
rely on their clinical experience with Prograf to appropriatel y titrate Astagraf XL .  For the 
purpose of th is study , immediate -release tacrolimus will be dosed in accordance with local 
center protocol.
2.3 Endpoints 
2.3.1 Primary Endpoints
The primary  endpoint is the combined incidence of either DSA or IA on peripheral blood 
molecular profiling at one y ear or at the conclusion of the study.  For this purpose, DSA will 
be considered as a categorical (binary ) variable with positivity  determined at a threshold 
criteria approaching MFI = 1000 at an y time during the stud y.  For reporting purposes, IA 
will be considered either present or absent using the Trugraf™ v2.0 molecular assay .  For the 
purposes of the stud y, a negative designation (Trugraf TX Normal) will be referred to as 
Immune Quiescence (IQ).  Due to operating characteristics of the assay , a positive 
designation will be considered evidence of Immune Activation (IA) in all patients.
The mFAS will be used for the primary  endpoint analy sis.
2.3.[ADDRESS_1229936] to the various molecular designations as well as 
correlating the results with DSA will rely  on the categorical ( binary ) variable of positivity  
using the Trugraf™ v2.0 molecular assay .  Comparisons between treatment cohorts regarding 
incidence will rel y upon assessments for each of the following results at any point in the study:
●DSA 
●IA 
●TG
●Acute and chronic forms of ABMR
●C1q-binding DSA
●HLA -DQ DSA
●DSA IgG 3 isoty pe
●Required antibod y reduction
●eGFR atvarious thresholds (less than 30, 40, and 50 mL /min/1.73 m2, and whether a 
five-point decline in eGFR occurs
●Graft loss (defined as subject death, retransplantation, transplant nephrectomy , or a 
return to dial ysis for at least a 6 week duration)
●Death
●BPAR (inclusive of ABMR and TCMR)
●Loss to follow -up
Sponsor: APGD, Medical Affairs, Americas ISN/Protocol IDTX -MA-[ADDRESS_1229937] occurrence will be assessed for each of the following: DSA, HLA- DQ DSA, 
C1q-binding DSA, DSA IgG 3isoty pe, IA, TG, select BANFF histology  grades (acute and 
chronic forms of ABMR, acute and chronic active TCMR, borderline changes, and IFTA ),
mortality , and local BPAR.
The frequency of the t ype of antibod y reduction employ ed will be assessed.
Patient MFI and eGFR values will be assessed o ver time .
Assessments of histopathology  in biopsies will be made using the following endpoints:
●Incidence of ci, ct, and ptc scores greater than one
●Biopsy  scores for g, t, v, i, cg, ct, ci, cv, ah, ptc, and mm 
The safet y endpoint for AEs will be the incidence of each t ype of AE based on system organ 
class and using the preferred term from themost recent version of the Medical Dictionary  for 
Regulatory  Activities ( MedDRA ).
Persistence of DSA and IA will be the additional endpoints for comparisons in patie nts who 
develop IA and DSA on molecular profiling.
2.3.3 Exploratory Endpoints
Additional exploratory  endpoints include the following:
● A second two-part composite endpoint encompassing the incidence of acquiring DSA or 
positive evidence of TG on biopsy  during the first y ear post- transplant or by  [CONTACT_880127] .
●Expression results, mapped to known immunological pathway s implicated in immune -
mediated, kidney  transplant tissue injury .
● With appropriate informed consent, long- term graft and patient surviv al in de- identified 
study  participants by  [CONTACT_880128][INVESTIGATOR_840] 
(SRTR) following completion of ASTOUND.
●The economic burden of treating patients with molecular evidence of immune activation 
and DSA formation usi ng Medicare claims data (or commercial pay er cost data in 
patients required to transfer from Medicare to private insurance).
●Outcomes in like patients between cohorts managed with maintenance protocol biopsy  
vs. biopsy  for cause with respect to the composi te endpoint, the components thereof, 
complications, and resource utilization.

dry weight, if dry  weight is not available) should be used for the initial dosing. There is no 
dosing adjustment for subjects with gastric sleeves. After the initial dose, Astagraf XL dosing

appropriate TDM of tacrolimus trough concentrations, ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurring [ADDRESS_1229956] that when identical trough levels are 
targeted, s ystemic exposure to tacrolimus is the same for both Prograf and Astagraf XL.
Patients receiving immediate -release tacrolimus should be initiated on therapy  per center 
protocol.
For the purposes of this study, patients receiving Astagraf XL or immediate -release 
tacrolimus should maintain a minimal tacrolimus trough concentration of 6 ng/mL at all 
times during the stud y.  The failure to do so for four out of 6 weeks (continuous) during the 
first [ADDRESS_1229957] a prolonged significant reduction of tacrolimus levels will be discontinued from the

switched from one therapy to another.  
Intravenous tacrolimus will not be provided by  [CONTACT_1034]. 
Instructions for NGT Administration of Immediate Release Tacrolimus
NGT administration of immediate release tacrolimus is only allowed for subjects randomized 
to the immediate release tacrolimus treatment arm. If a decision is made to administer 
immediate release tacrolimus via NGT, the capsules may  be opened and the contents mixed 
with 50 ml of water to form a suspension. The suspension should be drawn into a sy ringe and 
administered via the NGT. The container should t hen be refilled with another 50 ml of water, 
which should be drawn into the same sy ringe to flush the NGT tube and the container.   After 
administration, the NG T may  taken off suction in line with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13707]. Clinical studies 
Sponsor: APGD, Medical Affairs, Americas ISN/Protocol IDTX -MA-[ADDRESS_1229959] recommended removing the NGT from suction for 45 to 60 minutes after medication 
administration [Marubashi et al, 2012; PMR -EC-1106].
Appropriate safet y precautions should be taken when preparing a suspension of immediate 
release tacrolimus. 
Healthcare professionals should bear in mind thattacrolimus in any  form is not compatible 
with PVC (poly vinylchloride). Tubing, s yringes and other equipment used to prepare a 
suspension of immediate release tacrolimus capsule contents should not contain PV C.
5.1.2 Increase or Reduction in Dose of the Study Drug(s)
After initial dosing, subsequent dosing in patients receiving either Astagraf XL  or 
immediate -release tacrolimus should be predicated on clinical experience, patient tolerability, 
and monitoring of whol e blood tacrolimus drug concentrations, the measurement of which, 
along with target tacrolimus levels, should be guided by  [CONTACT_880133].  For the ASTOUND study , the lower limit of 
acceptable tacrolimus trough concentrations in both the Astagraf XL and immediate- release
tacrolimus treatment arms is 6 ng/mL  for the duration of the study .  If a prolonged period of 
reduced immunosuppression will be required to treat infection, sepsis, delayed wound 
healing, or other circumstances, patients should be removed from the study as per the 
discontinuation criteria (Section 6.1).
5.1.3 Previous and Concomitant Treatment (Medication and Non -Medication 
Therapy )
Previous medication (all medications taken up to 30 day s prior to transplant) and concomitant 
medication will be entered on the eCRF.  All patients will receive induction immunotherapy  
(either T- cell depleting agent, IL -2 co-stimulation blocker, or anti -CD52 monoclonal 
antibody –steroid onl y induction therap y is not allowed).  The dose and frequency  of the 
chosen induction agent will be determined b y the patient’s treating ph ysician and 
administered in conjunction w ith the participating transplant center’s de novo kidney  
immunosuppression protocol.  Anti- CMV, fungal, bacterial, and pneumocystis prophy laxis 
will be determined per local standard of care.  As a participant in ASTOUND, in addition to 
tacrolimus, study  subjects will need to concomitantly  receive MMF (or My fortic equivalent) 
and, if given per institutional protocol, corticosteroids (dose and duration of therap y of both 
medications to be determined according to clinical judgment of the patient’s attending 
physician) as their maintenance immunosuppressive regimen.
5.1.4 Treatment Compliance
Study  subjects should be counseled on the need to exhibit 100% compliance with their 
medication regimen in a manner that reflects a center’s own standard of care.  As this study  is 
designed to assess the real- world impact of either once -daily Astagraf XL or a twice daily 
tacrolimus regimen, investigators or their designee should not change how they  counsel 
patients on compliance based on their patient’s randomization status or par ticipation in 
ASTOUND.

5.1.5 Restrictions During the Study 
The following are prohibited medications during ASTOUND (see Appendix 12.1):
1)Extended -release formulations of tacrolimus, other than Astagraf XL 
2)Non-tacrolimus based immunosuppressive regimens (i.e., cyclosporine, e verolimus,

proposed intervention (Astagraf XL vs. twice daily, immediate -release tacrolimus), detection 
of DSA at an y time during the course of the study will be treated as a positive result.  For the 
purposes of the stud y, DSA positivity  will be defined at an MFI threshold approaching 1000.  
An independent adjudication board will take into account relevant clinical information to 
qualify  samples in borderline cases.  In cases where DSA is quantifiable, bu t nevertheless at 
an MFI < 1000, patient serum will be diluted and re -measured to mitigate the possible impact 
of the prozone phenomenon [Tambur et al, 2015].  Samples with new MFI levels above the 
target threshold will subsequently  be regarded as positive .  
In each case of quantifiable DSA or C1q -binding DSA at or above the MFI threshold, patient 
sera may  be diluted 1:16 and re -assessed [Tambur et al, 2015].  MFI readings remaining 
above 10,000 following dilution or those increasing to over 10,000 followi ng dilution (thus 
indicating prozone activity) will be regarded as “strong.”  Samples with MFI values from 
1000 to 10,000 will be designated “moderate.”  Serum samples that demonstrate
disappearance of MFI or reduction to < 1000 following dilution will be regarded as “weak.”
All borderline MFI threshold results will be reviewed b y the Adjudication Board (see 
Section 10.2 ) in conjunction with relevant clinical inform ation to confirm that the results 
have been categorized correctly. The Adjudication Board will also 1) review and adjudicate 
allcases antibod y formation (per central HLA lab assessment) post-transplantation and2) 
determine the need for ancillary  testing of pre -transplant sera in equivocal cases in which 
such testing could indicate the presence of pre -transplant DSA.

cellular and ABMR, 3) borderline changes (suspi[INVESTIGATOR_880076]), and 4) IFTA.  The 
diagnosis of acute and chronic forms of ABMR will be based on C4d positivity  with prior or 
current evidence of DSA during the stud y or evidence of chronic tissue inj ury, such as 
glomerular double contours, and/or peritubular capi[INVESTIGATOR_880077]/or interstitial fibrosis/tubular atroph y and/or fibrous intimal thickening in arteries, also

previously  described [Racusen et al, 1999].  Specimens will be regarded as positive for a 
particular feature if they  receive a score > 0 for that particular characteristic. TG will be

Validated molecular signatures will be used to cla ssify  patients dichotomously  at each blood 
sampling (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months following transplantation) as “IA” or Immune 
Quiescence (IQ) . It is assumed that other causes for the IA signature [CONTACT_880166] r andoml y distributed between the 2 groups .The frequency  of 
IA and IQ signatures will be compared between cohorts receiving Astagraf XL  and 
immediate -release tacrolimus. The use of clinical and biopsy -proven samples from over 
500 patients at 7 clinical centers in the [LOCATION_002] and one from Brazil has enabled 
creation of locked Transplant Genomics Inc. (TGI) classifiers based on core data sets for 
each possible molecular phenoty pe.Thus, each new patient in the ASTOUND study  will be 
treated as an unkno wn and run against each of the core data sets for classification using a 
TGI automated workflow based on multiple R Bioconductor tools and enabling scripts.
For the purposes of the study , assessment and comparison of the incidence of the molecular 
endpoint will rely  on a binary  molecular designation in accordance with the TruGraf v2.0 
molecular assay .  A negative designation (Trugraf TX Normal) will be referred to as Immune 
Quiescence (IQ).  Due to operating characteristics of the assay , a positive designation will be 
considered evidence of Immune Activation (IA) in all patients.
The above -mentioned classifier has alread y been “locked” during the discovery process to 
avoid over -training a classifier on new data. As a dichotomous variable, ‘ IQ’ will represent 
any patient sample classified as not positive .In turn, ‘ IA’ will represent any patient sample 
not classified as ’IQ’.Biopsies, when available, will be used to inform the molecular 
diagnosis when alternative pathology  is recognized (i.e. recurr ent disease).

designee will conduct the exam, determine findings, and assess any abnormalities as to 
clinical significance.
5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a stud y drug 
or who has undergone a study  procedure whic h does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be an y unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. 
An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical exam) should be defined as an AE only  if the abnormality  meets one of the 
follow ing criteria:
●Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms
●Requires active intervention
●Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  medication
●The abnormalit y or investigational value is clinically  significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070].
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE s)
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any  of the following outcomes:
●Results in death
●Is life threatening (an adverse event is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of 
Sponsor: APGD, Medical Affairs, Americas ISN/Protocol IDTX -MA-[ADDRESS_1229967] caused death)
●Results in persistent or sig nificant disability /incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions 
● R esults in congenital anomaly, or birth defect
● Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28939] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_880079]/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered 
as serious) 
●Other medicall yimportant events
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacit y, 
should also usually  be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in 
an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Special situations on the medicinal products administered to the subject as part of the study  
(e.g., study  drug, comparator, background therapy) that may  require expedited reporting 
and/or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:
● Overdose of the medicinal product(s)
●Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product(s)
●Drug exposure during pregnancy  or via breast milk
● Medication error involving the medicinal product(s) (with or without subject/patient 
exposure to the Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])
All of the special situations noted above should be recorded on the eCRF . Any  special 
situations that also meets the criteria for an SAE should be recorded on the AE page of t he 
eCRF and marked ‘serious’ and the SAE worksheet. 
The Sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events.  I f an adverse 
event is reported that is considered to be an event per this classification as “alway s serious”, 
additional information on the event may be requested.
5.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug
Adverse events that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as "adverse 
events whose relationship to the study  drugs could not be ruled out".
Causal relationship to 
the study drugCriteria for ca usal relationship
Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and /orin which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.

time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a 
clinically reasonable response on re- administration (rechallenge) or 
withdrawal (dechallenge).
5.5.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse event
●Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities (Asy mptomatic, or mild sy mptoms, 
clinical or diagnostic observations noted; intervention not indicated.)
●Moderate: Affect normal dail y activities (L ocal or noninvasive intervention indicated.)
●Severe: Inability  to perform dail y activities (Medicall y significant but not immediately 
life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266].)
5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
In the case of a serious adverse event (SAE), the investigator must contact [CONTACT_29003] (within 24 hours of awareness).
The investigator should complete and submit an SAE Worksheet containing all information 
that is required b y the Regulator y Authorities to the Sponsor by  [CONTACT_29004] (within

When the outcome of the pregnancy  falls under the criteria for SAE s [spontaneous ab ortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomal y (including anomaly  in a 
miscarried fetus)], the investigator should respond in accordance with the report procedure 
for SAE s.  Additional information regarding the outcome of a preg nancy  (which is 
categorized as an SAE ) is mentioned below.
●"Spontaneous abortion "includes miscarriage, abortion, and missed abortion
●Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of 
its relationship with the study  drug
●If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as " possible "by

from the anal yses planned in the SAP will be justified in the Clinical Study  Report (CSR).
Prior to Database Lock, a Final Rev iew of Data and TLFs Meeting will be held to allow a 
review of the clinical trial data and to verify  the data that will be used for analy sis set 
classification.  If required, consequences for the statistical analy sis will be discussed and

7.1 Sample Size
The sample size for this study  was determined based upon a comparison of the rate of the 
two-part composite endpoint in the Astagraf XL group compared to the immediate -release 
tacrolimus group.  Assuming a rateof 20% would be observed for the immediate -release 
tacrolimus group compared to a rate of 10% for the Astagraf XL group, 220 subjects per 
group are needed to achieve an 80% power to detect a difference between Astagraf XL and 
immediate -release tacrolimus with a two- sided alpha level of 0.05.  The study will enroll

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is the combi ned incidence of either DSA or IAon molecular 
blood profiling at one year or at the conclusion of the study .
The primary  endpoint will be anal yzed at a single time point, corresponding to end of study  
and with respect to the formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] (see Sect ion 7.8.1 ). The primary  analy sis of this 
endpoint will be based on the m FAS. The incidence of the primary  endpoint will be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_880142].  Differences between 
treatment groups will be anal yzed using logistic regression with the following covariates: 
treatment group (Astagraf XL group versus the immediate -release group), the pre -defined 
randomization st ratification factors, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29039], race, and gender ;type of induction 
therap y, delay ed graft function, and pre -transplant cPRA.
For subjects with missing or incomplete endpoint data who did not permanently  switch 
therap y or were discontinued from the stud y prior to a DSA/IA event, who are lost to follow 
up, or those who expi[INVESTIGATOR_880092] y reason), negative DSA/ I A values will be impute d unless

posterior Bay esian probability  that the primary  endpoint’s incide nce rate will, indeed, be at least 
20% (see Appendix 12.4 for assumption details).  
As mentioned above, a decision to terminate the study  early orextend to a second y ear will be 
predicated on the event rate in the control arm once 50% of control patients have completed one 
year of therapy .  At that time, the estimated proportion will be used to calculate the Beta -
binomial posterior Bay esian probabi lity that the primary  endpoint’s incidence rate will, indeed, 
be at least 20%.
If this probability  is ≥ 70%, the following rules apply :
1)The study  will continue to enroll to completion. 
2)The study  duration will be such that patients will complete at least o ne year of study  
visits.
a)Patients who have not y et completed one year of study  (at the time of the interim 
analysis) will complete the study  at the 12m visit.
b) Patients who have already  completed the 12m visit (at the time of the interim 
analysis) will comp lete the study at their next scheduled study  visit. 
3)Data analy sis will be performed once all patients complete 12 months of study .

8.1 Procedure for Clinical Study Quality Control
8.1.1 Data Collection
The investigator or site designee willenter data collected using an Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) s ystem. In the interest of collecting data in the most efficient manner, the investigator 
or sit e designee should record data (including local laboratory  values, as applicable) in the 
electronic case report form (eCRF) within [ADDRESS_1229995] visit.
The investigator or site designee is responsible to ensure that all data in the eCRFs and 
queries are accurate and complete and thatall entries are verifiable with source documents. 
These documents should be appropriatel y maintained by [CONTACT_779].
The monit or should verify  the data in the eCRFs with source documents according to the 
study  monitoring plan. 
Laboratory  testing performed during the course of routine clinical care, including HLA 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_880097] -transplant cross- match results, will be performed ac cording to local standards. 
De-identified copi[INVESTIGATOR_880098] t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_189032] (donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) as well as recent pre -
transplant local DSA testing results (if performed per SOC) will be sent to the central lab.
For the antibody  and molecular assessments condu cted b y the central laboratory (performed at 
baseline, months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24), results will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_880099] y 
transferred to Astellas or itsdesignee for inclusion in the clinical study  database. The results of 
these central a ssessments for each participant will be shared with the corresponding 
Investigator .The results of the antibody  assessments will be provided, as available (testing 
performed in batches), on an on -going basis, throughout the stud y.  The results of the molec ular 
assessments will not be shared with the corresponding Investigator until the end of the study .
For all participants who undergo at least one kidney  biops y during the first year post -
transplant (either for cause or per institutional protocol), the kidn ey biopsy  performed closest 
to the 12 month visit (but no later than [ADDRESS_1229996] -transplant) will be submitted for 
central pathology  review for pathological grading. It is preferred that centers submit whole 
slide digital imaging using a standard proto col on at least Hematoxly in and Eosin (H&E), 
Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS), Trichrome -stained slides , silver slides, immunoperoxidase C4d, 
and control immunoperoxidase slides for C4d (as available ). If an institution does not do 
whole slide imaging, then the paraffin section slides must also be submitted for central 
review along with the available digital images. Absent the availability  of digital pathology  
transmission capabilities, centers will submit representative H&E, PAS, Trichrome -stained, 
silver, immunoperoxidase C4d, and control immunoperoxidase C4d slides (as available) for 
central pathology  review. The results for each participant with a central pathology  review 
will be shared with the corresponding Investigator at the end of stud y, upon I nvestigator /site 
request.
For screen failures, the demographic data, reason for failing , informed consent/assent, 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and AEs will be collected in the eCRF. 
Sponsor: APGD, Medical Affairs, Americas ISN/Protocol IDTX -MA-[ADDRESS_1229997] all protocol-required data in the prov ided electronic 
Case Report Forms (eCRF).  In the interest of collecting data in the most efficient manner, 
the investigator or site designee should record data (including laboratory  values, if 
applicable) onto the eCRF as soon as possible after the subjec t visit.  ECRFs and any  
supporting documents should be available for retrieval b y the Sponsor/delegated CRO at an y 
given time.  The monitor should verify  the data in the eCRFs with source documents to 
confirm that there are no inconsistencies between them.  
If any inconsistency is detected on the collected eCRFs, the monitor or data manager should 
query  the investigator/sub- investigator.  The investigator /sub-investigator should provide an 
answer to the query  and provide the resolved query  to the Sponsor.
The monitor should verify  the revised data of the eCRFs with source documents and confirm 
that there are no inconsistencies between them, and also check that appropriate records on the 
correction/addition of data are maintained.

v2.1, Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 2 Astellas Page 102of 124To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the investigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  Sy mptoms 
and new onset -diseases should be recorded as ‘adverse events’ on the AE page of the
eCRF. Illnesses and conditions such as hy potensive events, and decompensated cardiac 
disease t hatmay lead to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Non -alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) is seen in obese h yperlipoproteinemic, and/or diabetic patients 
and may  be associated with fluctuating aminotransferase levels.   The investigator should 
ensure that the medical history  form captures any  illness that pre -dates study  enrollment 
that may  be relevant in assessing hepatic function. 
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription medication, 
complementary and alterna tive medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets.  Medications, including dose, should be entered on the concomitant 
medicat ion page of the e CRF .  Information on alcohol, other substance use, and diet 
should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document .
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents .
●Based on the subject ’s history , other testing may  be appropriate including: 
oacute viral hepatitis (A,B, C, D, E or other infectious agents) 
oultrasound or other im aging to assess biliary tract disease

●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations.
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an

Study Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFT’s, such as viral hepatitis, pre -existing or 
acute liver disease or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury , the subject may  be 
discontinued from the study . The investigato r may determine that it is not in the subject’s 
best interest to continue study  enrollment. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered

v2.1, Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 2 Astellas Page 105of [ZIP_CODE].4 Interim Decision Rule Details
The Interim report stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_880108] a Bay esian methodology  of the 
Beta- Binomial posterior distribution.  
The prior distribution used as the basis of the posterior is the Beta(α=2, β=8) .  This prior was 
chosen due to its expectation (mean) of 0.20, and therefore remains consistent with the 
assumption that the twice daily  tacrolimus DSA/IA composite endpoint in cidence rate is 0.20 
(Section 7.1).  The variance of the distribution was also anal yzed for robustness to the scaling 
of α andβ, holding the expec tation constant (mean of 0.20).  Note that in this case, the 
variance of the Beta distribution is inversely  related to the scaling of parameters.  The 
decision rule cutoff values found in Section 7.8.[ADDRESS_1230031] to scaling of the parameters 
for an ything from 1/1000 to unity  (results not shown).  Decreasing the variance bey ond what 
is associated with a Beta(α=2, β=8) distribution was not considered in order to ma intain the 
conservative nature of weighting prior information.  
Let xbe the number of occurrences of the DSA/IA composite primary  endpoint, nbe the 
number of evaluable subjects at the time of analy sis, and pbe the actual probability  of the 
primary  endp oint’s occurrence in the population of twice dail y tacrolimus use.  Therefore, the 
posterior probability  is based on the assumption that x given nand pis distributed as 
         ( ,  ) .  Therefore given the prior distribution of  | ,  ~     (  = 2,   = 8) and a 
binomial distribution for the frequency  of the DSA/IA primary  endpoint 
( | ,  ~          [ ,  ]), then b y Bayes’ rule the conditional distribution of pfollows as a 
Beta- Binomial posterior of  | ,  ,  ,  ~     (2 +  , 8 +   −   ).
The following table [Table 1] illustrates the possible posterior probabilities of p ≥ 0.2 for the 
twice dail y tacrolimus group given 50% of the planned subjects completed the 12 month 
follow -up visit ( n= 110).  I n particular, the distribution in this case is  | ,  ,  ,  ~     (2 +
 ,118−  ).

be terminated earl y due to the immediate -release tacrolimus arm having a DSA/I A incidence 
rate l ess than 0.20.
All analy ses in this report are based on SAS version 9.3, a [ADDRESS_1230033] 0.80.  Additionally, the conservative distributional assumptions of 
Fisher’s Exact Test are used.
The following figu re and table illustrate the difference in statistical significance tests between
having a sample of 220 subjects per treatment group (study  data from either the one year or 
two y ear study  design) versus 110 subjects (earl y termination study  data).  In this case, the 
difference between the boundaries of statistical significance for the two possible sample sizes 
illustrates the risk of the study  having insufficient power to statistically  detect a difference 
between the treatment arms due to  earl y termination of the study .  
For example, the first line of Table 1 represents a potential scenario where the immediate -
release tacrolimus cohort has a 0.19 incidence of DSA/ I A. In this scenario, if the sample size 
per treatment group is N=220, statistical significance will be met with at least 80% power if 
the Astagraf XL cohort’s incidence is 0.093 or less.  However, if the size of each treatment 
group is N=110, statistical significance will be met with at least 80% power if Astagraf XL 
cohort’s incidence of DSA/IA is less than or equal to 0.059.  Therefore, in this example 
scenario, the range between 0.059 and 0.093 for DSA/I A incidence in the Asta graf XL cohort 
shows the risk of study  failure due to earl y study termination –i.e. had the study  not 
termina ted early , the Astagraf XL cohort’s DSA/IA incidence would be statistically  
distinguishable from the immediate -release tacrolimus cohort’s incidence; however, with the 
early termination, there is not sufficient statistical power to detect a difference in D SA/IA
incidence between the two cohorts.  
The calculations in the following table and figure show the incidence boundaries for at least 
80% power under incidence rates of DSA/IA in the immediate- release tacrolimus arm of 
0.[ADDRESS_1230034] for this study .

ISN/Protocol IDTX -MA-3004
Non-Substantial Amendment 2
May 25, 201 8
I.  The purpose of this amendment is:
Non-Substantial Changes
1. Revision of molecular profiling categories 
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE
Sub-categories for the molecular profiling endpoints of cAR (clinical acute rejection) and 
subAR (subacute rejection) were removed throughout the protocol.  
RATIONALE:
Since the approval of the previous protocol amendment, Transplant Genomics, I nc. (the 
vendor performing the molecular categorization analy ses) have revised their molecular 
categorizations; the changes in the amendment, therefore, reflect the categorization s available 
in the most contemporary  version of Transplant Genomics’ TruGraf v2.[ADDRESS_1230036].  
2. Addition of two exploratory objectives to compare the molecular profiling results 
with creatinine and (where available) biopsy results 
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE
Two exploratory  objectives were added to assess creatinine results in subjects with the 
immune activation ( IA)designation and to compare biopsy  results for concordance , where 
available, in patients with an IA designation and abnormal creatinine. 
RATIONALE:
Given that the TruGraf 2.[ADDRESS_1230037] has only  been formally  validated in patients with normal renal 
function, additional exploratory  objectives were included to improve the confidence of results 
in all study  patients (which also includes patients with abnormal creatinines).
3. Clarification of the requirement that all subjects must be taking Mycophenolate 
Mofetil (MMF) or its equivalent while on study
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE
Language was inserted into the concomitant medications section and disc ontinuation criteria 
to clarify  that patients must be maintained on MMF or its equivalent throughout the study . 
RATIONALE
Correction of previous oversight; MMF or its equivalent is given with tacrolimus per 
standard practice / product labeling requirements. 
4. Addition of discontinuation criteria related to tacrolimus discontinuation or 
Sponsor: APGD, Medical Affairs, Americas ISN/Protocol IDTX -MA-[ADDRESS_1230038] a significant reduction or interruption of tacrolimus 
for a period exceeding four weeks. 
RATIONALE:
In the previous amendment, the requirement for a minimum tacrolimus trough concentration 
was removed (due to variation in standard of care therapeutic drug monitoring levels at 
participating centers). This raised questions about whether subjects whose tacr olimus was 
intentionally  reduced (e.g., temporaril y, due to infection or other medical reasons) should be 
discontinued. These revised discontinuation criteria address those questions.   
5. Clarification that Astagraf XL may not be remotely dispensed wit hout prior written 
approval from the Sponsor 
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE
Language inserted to confirm that, due to study  drug handling requirements, remotely  
dispensing Astagraf XL (for example, by  [CONTACT_880159]) is prohibited without prior 
written approval from the Sponsor. 
RATIONALE
Several participating centers have provided feedback that language related to study  drug 
handling is not sufficiently  clear in the protocol for them to discern whether Astagraf XL 
may be sent directly  to subjects via courier. Language was added to prevent centers from 
couriering study Astagraf XL  to study  subjects without adequate quality  assurance. 
6. Minor edits to improve clarity of language
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE
Grammatical, consistency , and other minor edits throughout the document. 
RATIONALE:
The changes are intended to facilitate better understanding and implementation of the study  
protocol.

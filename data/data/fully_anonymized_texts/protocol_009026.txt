Title:  
Non-Damaging Photothermal  Therapy of Non-exudative Age Related Macular 
Degeneration  
 
Introduction  
 
Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness 
and visual disability among patients exceeding 60 years of age in the western 
hemisphere. The clinical presentation of AMD ranges from soft drusen in 
patients with normal visua l acuit y to geographic atrophy or subfoveal 
choroidal neovascularization (CNVs), disciform scarring and eventually legal 
blindness.1  
 Approximately 10 to 15% of patients with AMD develop  severe visual 
loss due to geographic atrophy characterized by [CONTACT_523412][INVESTIGATOR_178712], choriocapi[INVESTIGATOR_523406]. 
Nonexudative AMD is responsible for about 25% of the severe visual loss and 
the remaining i s caused by [CONTACT_523413]2. Fortunately, with the 
introduction of pharmacological anti-VEGF treatment s to neovascular AMD , 
exudative AMD can be effectively treated, thereby [CONTACT_523414] . However, there is sti ll no treatment for 
nonexudative AMD other than vitamin supplementation , and patients 
inevitably progress to ad vanced disease and associated visual loss.3 
 The cumulative incidence of new exudative or atrophic lesions in  
eyes initially free of advanced  AMD has been estimated as 8.6% at one year, 
16.4% at two years and 23.5% at three years .[ADDRESS_679254] eye, varies from  7% to 87%  depending on the coexiste nce of four 
main risk factors  (presence of five or more drusen, focal hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
one or  more large dr usen and systemic hypertension) . 
Owing to the risk of vision  loss associated with the presence of large 
volume of  drusen, retinal laser treatment was proposed to prevent 
progression to advanced  AMD. Several clinical trials have been conducted to 
test the effect of laser photocoagulation on reabsorption of  drusen  in the 
macula.5-[ADDRESS_679255] 
been used with varying levels of energy  (ranging  from sub-visible to faint or 
intense whitish retinal lesions).   The assumption was tha t phagocytic cells or 
macrophages clearing the laser -induced debris in the retina, RPE and choroid 
could  also reduce or eliminate the drusen . It was als o speculated that laser 
could trigger release of cytokines and growth factors from the RPE , which 
may ac t on drusen regress ion.  
A systematic review of  all clinical trials using laser treatment of drusen 
demonstrat ed that there was a significant reduction of drusen over time . 
However there was a lso found a slight  increase in the incidence of CNV and 
geographic atrophy , albeit not statistically significant  3. This increase could be 
related to the fact that conventional photocoagulation used in most of these 
trials  damaged the Bruch’s membrane,  consequently in ducing CNV. 
Therefore, a non -damaging laser treatment strategy might be able  to induce 
drusen regression without the known side effects of photocoagulation. This 
hypothesis is supported by [CONTACT_49392]  “subthreshold” laser treat ments of the  
drusen resulted in their reduction with much fewer side ef fects than with 
2 
 
conventional visible burns : 6 out of 63 eyes treated with visible burns 
developed CNV within 3 months of treatment, while no such CNV was 
reported for subthreshold treatment . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_523407], the 
treatment did not slow the prog ression to geographic atrophy or to CNV, 
compared to observation in this trial. This  might be due to very small number 
(a few tens) of laser spots  applied to the macula . Our approach might rectify 
this deficiency by [CONTACT_523415] : 500 non-damaging 
spots . 11-12 
Micropulse laser photocoagulation avoid s the excessive heat ing which  
causes visible burns, tissue necrosis, and related collateral effects13, while 
providing similar clinical benefits as  conventional laser coagulation .14 -19 
However, the lack of a reliable titration for every patient and absence of visible 
endpoint makes it difficult for the physician to (a) know which retinal areas 
have been treated and (b) to ensure the adequate amount of laser energy  in 
the treatment . In addition, the dense coverage of the retina with the sub -
visible laser exposures typi[INVESTIGATOR_523408] [ADDRESS_679256] developed the titration protocol for PASCAL laser , which 
ensures that pulse energy is within the range of clinic al efficacy, but does not 
exceed the tissue damage threshold 21 in every patient. This protocol, called 
EndPoint Management, has been recently tested in a clinical trial, which 
demonstrated its safety and efficacy in treatment of Central Serous 
Retinopathy22 using 30% energy settings. The trial demonstrated lack of  
tissue damage and excellent tissue response to the treatment, even after 
multiple retreatments. The average retreatment period in this trial was found 
to be 6 months.   
We propose to use the same  laser parameters for treatment of the 
macula in patients with early AMD to prevent drusen growth and 
advancement of the disease into geographic atrophy or neovascularization.  
 
AIMS OF THE STUDY  
 
1. To determine whether photothermal  therapy (PTT) of the macula with 
EpM® reduces the volume of drusen in the macula.  
2. To determine whether PTT decrease s the  incidence of advanced AMD 
(neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy).  
 
The primary efficacy outcome measure will be the reduction in drusen 
volume in the central 3mm circle over 12, 18, 24  months in subjects  treated 
with PTT , compared to observation alone .    
The secondary efficacy  outcome s after the month 12, 18, 24  of follow up will 
be: 
• Functional outcome :  
▪ Mean change in visual acuity in both groups . 
• Anatomical outcome:  
• Reduction of drusen growth ; 
• Prevention of  neovascular AMD ; 
• Prevention of geographic atrophy based on OCT and 
FAF.   
3 
 
• Safety Assessments . Safety of the treatment  will be assessed for 
ocular adverse event incidence (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), 
based on the reports of the patients  and examination during or 
between visits until  the month 24 of follow up.  After 24 months, 
subjects will then be followed for an additional 3 years for 
observation  
• Serious adverse events  (SAEs) will be monitored continuously.

baseline and disease severity. Results will be presented as differences 
between the treatment arms with their associated 95% confidence intervals, 
and non - significant effects interpreted in the context of these and the limited 
power of the study.  
 
SAMPLE SIZE:  
 
We estimated our sample size based on previous comparable 
publications that included approximately 50 eyes on average.11-12 
 
EFFICACY MEASURES:  
 
Primary Outcome:  
• Reduction in drusen volume in arm A  compared to arm B. 
 
Secondary Outcomes:  
• Mean change in visual acuity (ETDRS letters)  
• Mean change in average central retinal thickness (ACRT) after 
12, 18, 24  months of follow up.  
• The proportion of patients with ACRT < [ADDRESS_679266] after 12 , 18, 24  months of follow up   
• Conversion into GA or CNV  
 
SAFETY MEASURES:  
 
• Monitoring of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse effects 
(SAEs) (the incidence of ocular AEs and SAEs).  
• Assessment of the retinal autofluorescence to identify any laser 
burn.  
• Signs of any laser burn identified at RPE -photoreceptors layers 
on DRI -OCT.  
 
ADVERSE EFFECTS:  
 
• Any medical incidence in patients who received laser that could be 
associated with the tre atment delivered in the research study.  
• Any temporal or transitory adverse effect that has relationship to the 
study therapy.  
REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8 
 
• With any AE, we will treat the SP as appropriate to prevent further 
complications and to potentially resolve the event.  
• SAEs and AE will be reported immediately (when the subject is in the 
office, if possible or within 24 hours of learning of the event) to the 
principal investigator, study coordinator and sponsor. The SP subject 
will be referred for further medical treatment if required.  
• Follow -up reports on AEs should indicate whether the AE is presumed 
to be device -related, or a result of other factors, and should be 
recorded on the Adverse Events Report. The Adve rse Events Report 
should be completed each time the subject is seen during the 
management of the incident and at resolution of the incident.  
• All AEs occurring from the time of written informed consent throughout 
the course of the study (end of study is def ined as the end of the scan 
acquisition) will be recorded at the study site.    
• The AE  should be made to describe it in terms of a diagnosis.  If a 
clear diagnosis has been made, individual signs and symptoms will not 
be recorded unless they represent atyp ical or extreme manifestations 
of the diagnosis, in which case they should be reported as separate 
events.  If a clear diagnosis cannot be established, each sign and 
symptom must be recorded individually.  
 
All the adverse events shall be recorded in detail  as specified below:  
Name (Type)  The common name [CONTACT_523425].  
Date of onset  The first date that the physician in charge found the adverse 
event shall be written down.  
Causal 
relation  Write down probable causes, and classify the causal relation 
with the test device depending on the presence or absence of 
the causal relationship as defined below. The adverse events 
that are judged to have no relation with the test devises are 
classified as complica tions; all the others are classified as 
adverse device effects.  
Probably not 
related  The adverse event is definitely related to other 
than the test device. (Complication)  
Possibly 
related  The adverse event is possibly related to the 
test device; the causal relationship with the 
test devices is fully undeniable. (Adverse 
device effect)  
Probably 
related  The cause of the adverse event cannot be 
located. However, the adverse event is 
probably related to the test device. (Adverse 
device effect)  
Definitely 
related  The adverse event is definitely related to the 
test device. (Adverse device effect).  
Severity  The severity shall be classified into mild, moderate and severe 
based on the criteria:  
Mild The symptom is mild and expected to heal 
soon.  
[ADDRESS_679267]’s daily life depending 
on the subject’s physical predisposition or the 
circumstances under which the adverse event 
appeared.  
Symptom, 
progress and 
treatment  Necessity for treatment and progress from the detection of the 
adverse event and the determination of outcome shall be 
written down.  
Outcome  The classification into “healed”, “unchanged”, “aggravated”, or 
“death” and the outcome date shall be written down. If the 
subject died, statement of death shall be made.

adverse 
event  Views on the adverse event by [CONTACT_523419]. Omission is allowed if there are no special 
comments.  
  
POTENTIAL RISKS:  
 
• Complications of conventional laser therapy including marked vision 
loss, paracentral scotomas or accidental application of laser in the 
fovea. There is limited data regarding potential risks of photothermal  
therapy, however, due to its non -damaging nature, it is expected to be 
safer than conventional photocoagulation.  
 
STUDY PATIENT DISPOSITION  
 
Completed SP: A completed SP is one who has not been discontinued from 
the study and has completed all study rela ted procedures.  
 
Discontinued SP:  SP may be discontinued prior to their completion of the 
study due to:  
• subject request  
• adverse events  
• protocol violations  
• administrative reasons (e.g., inability to continue, lost 
to follow up)  
• termination of the study  
Note: In addition, any SP may be discontinued for any sound medical reason.  
Notification of a SP discontinuation and the reason for discontinuation will be 
clearly documented.

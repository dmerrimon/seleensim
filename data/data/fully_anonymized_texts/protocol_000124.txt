registered on clinicaltrials.gov protocol number 15052002. Patients undergoing primary 
total anatomic (TSA) or reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) were screened for 
eligibili ty. Inclusion criteria included patients diagnosed with primary osteoarthritis, 
rotator cuff arthropathy, or post -traumatic arthritis indicated for a total or reverse 
shoulder arthroplasty. Patients who had a recent corticosteroid injection were also 
inclu ded; this information however was not documented or recorded. Exclusion criteria 
included patients with any prior arthroscopic or open shoulder surgery to the affected side, 
patients with a known history of infection or recent antibiotic use within [ADDRESS_309434] perioperative 
antibiotics with weight -based cefazolin (2g for under 120kg, 3g for over 120kg) within [ADDRESS_309435] skin 
preparation with both alcohol and chlorhexidin e (Chloraprep (Becton, Dickinson, and

routinely shaved at our institution. I n the treatment group, doxycycline was infused 
starting ninety minutes prior to skin incision. This infusion was given over one hour to 
prevent thrombophlebitis as per the recommendations of our pharmacist. Once the 
doxycycline infusion was complete, the l ine was then flushed with normal saline, and 
cefazolin was infused over thirty minutes prior to skin incision. In the control group, the 
cefazolin was infused over thirty minutes prior to skin incision.  
 
During the procedure, aerobic and anaerobic cultures  were taken. These culture included 
(1) an excisional tissue biopsy of the skin edge, (2) a tissue swab of the superficial dermal 
tissue within the incision, and (3) a tissue swab of the glenohumeral joint. The first 
culture was taken immediately after inc ision and was an excision of the skin edge that 
was approximately [ADDRESS_309436] surgical protocol, using a separate knife and instrumentation for superficial 
dissection and deep dissection.

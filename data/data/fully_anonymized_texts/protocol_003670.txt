Study Rationale  To compare the kinetics and efficacy of two functionally different diagnostic 
agents, Lymphoseek (CD206 receptor targeted) and 99mTc-SC (non- specific 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_231505]) in intraoperative lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ( ILM) and SLNB.   
Study Design  Single center, blinded, randomized, parallel -group , comparative study of 
Lymphoseek and 99mTc-SC in the preoperative and intraoperative detection of 
lymph nodes in subject s with known breast cancer. All subjects will receive a 
single dose of [ADDRESS_640668] s may also receive up to 1 m L of vital blue dye 
(VBD)  as a companion ILM agent . All radio -labeled agents will be 
administered in a single intradermal injection.   
Methodology  Subjects will participate in 3 study visits (including the Screening Visit  
[Visit 1]) over the course of the study period. Screening will include an assessment of eligibility and informed consent, a review of concomitant medications, and a random assignment to a treatment group. During Visit 2, 
all subjects will r eceive either a single intradermal injection of Lymphoseek 
or 
99mTc-SC based upon the treatment group assigned at screening, followed 
by [CONTACT_498196]: initial sequential planar imaging 
at [ADDRESS_640669]/CT for higher resolution imaging in transaxial, coronal, and 
sagittal planes (see 
Appendix E ). Subjects will then proceed to surgery for 
lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Lymphoseek  and 99mTc-SC positivity will be based upon 
Protocol Number/Version: KHNIC -P14- 001/B  
Date:  April 29, [ADDRESS_640670] procedures.  Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_498197] 5 ± [ADDRESS_640671]- surgery (Visit 3) to assess adverse events.   
Number of Subjects  The sample size for the study is based on the co -primary endpoints.  In order 
to have an 80% chance of demonstrating that Lymphoseek is superior to 
99mTcSC based on the injection site clearance rate, assuming that the mean 
rate of Lymphoseek is 0.250, the mean rate of 99mTc-SC is 0.05, and the 
common standard deviation is 0.15, at least [ADDRESS_640672] an 80% chance of demonstrating that Lymphoseek is 
superior to 99mTcSC based on the SLN uptak e rate, assuming that the mean 
rate of Lymphoseek is 0.1075, the mean rate of 99mTcSC is 0.0875, and the 
common standard deviation is 0.0009, at least 19 subjects will need to be 
enrolled in each treatment group.   
In order to meet the sample size requirements for each endpoint, 
approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled in the study.  These sample size 
calculations were based on a two -sided α=0.[ADDRESS_640673] 
Participation  75  days (includes screening period)  
Approximate 
Duration of Study  [ADDRESS_640674] 
uptake rate of 99mTc-SC will be conducted at a two-sided α=0.05 (one-sided 
α=0.025)  level of significance.     
The secondary efficacy variables are:  
• Number of SLNs identified in each subject  
• Gamma counts at the primary injection site in the breast and the ex vivo gamma counts of the SLNs removed  
• Pain scores  
• Pathology status of SLNs 
Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum)  will be computed for each of the secondary variables. 
All analyses of kinetics and efficacy will be performed on the ITT population, which consists of 
all enrolled subjects who were randomized, received an 
injection of Lymphoseek or 99mTc-SC, went to surgery, and had at least one 
lymph node removed that was confirmed to be lymph tissue and had a known disease st atus (positive or negative for disease) by [CONTACT_26745].

Protocol Number/Version: KHNIC -P14- 001/B  
Date:  April 29, [ADDRESS_640677] cancer by [CONTACT_498198] 1993 [1] and Giuliano  in 1994 [2], intraoperative 
lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (ILM) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) ha ve become stand ard-of-care 
techn ologies  widely utilized in the surgical staging and treatment of breast cancer.  The utilization of 
ILM/SLNB for breast cancer has resulted in the reduction in the short -term complications and long -term 
morbidities , including lymphedema,  that are generally associated with axillary lymph node dissection 
(ALND)  [3-6]. Additional ly, the utilization of ILM/SLNB has allowed for the avoidance of the need of 
ALND in cases of early -stage breast cancer with limited sentinel lymph node (SLN) involvement in both 
cases of breast conserving surgery [7,8] and mastectomy [8].  
An ideal lymph node mappi[INVESTIGATOR_498184]/SLNB should exhibit rapid cleara nce from the injection site, 
rapid uptake and high retention within the first draining lymph node(s), and low uptake by [CONTACT_498199], 
higher echelon lymph nodes. The ideal lymph node mappi[INVESTIGATOR_498185], 
molecular size uniformit y, and a high level of biologic and radiation safety. Specifically regarding a 
radiopharmaceutical lymph node mappi[INVESTIGATOR_231505], it should possess characteristics for allowing for 
convenient, rapid, and stable 99mTc labeling.   
For breast cancer, 99mTc-radiotr acer agents and blue dye agents, used separately or in combination, have 
been described for use during ILM/SLNB [9] . Likewise,  multiple injection routes for ILM/SLNB have 
been described [9]. Definitive evidence for the superiority of the intradermal inject ion route for the 
administration of  a 99mTc-radiotrac er agent (i.e., 99mTc-Sulfur Colloid  abbreviated here as 99mTc-SC) 
during ILM/SLNB is well  established from a pro spective, randomized clinical trial comparing the 
intraparenchymal, subareolar, and intradermal injection routes  in [ADDRESS_640678] cancer patients  [10]. This 
prospective, randomized clinical trial demonstrated that the i ntradermal radiotracer i njection r oute: (1) 
allowed for the greatest success of identification of  an axillary SLN; ( 2) allow ed for minimization of the 
time from injection  of radiocolloid to successful identification of an axillary  SLN; and ( 3) resulted in  the 
generation of the ‘hottest” axillary SLN  and the shortest intraoperative time to harvest.  
Prior to July 2011, 99mTc-SC had been used exclusively off- label for all ILM/SL NB procedures performed 
in the U nited States over the past 20 years.  However, in July 2011, 99mTc-SC eventually received  formal 
FDA approval in the U nited States by  [CONTACT_498200] , Inc.  (Billerica, [LOCATION_005]) for ILM during 
SLNB for breast cancer  [11,12]. Concurrently, within the past 10 years, a novel, soluble, synthetic  (i.e., 
non-biologic) , receptor -directed targeting agent, 99mTc-Tilmanocept ( Lymphoseek®, Navidea 
Biopharma ceuticals, Dublin, Ohio) has been developed for ILM/SLNB  [13-16] , and has been formally 
evaluated in two multi -institutional, open- label, nonrandomized, “within- patient ,” Phase 3 clinical trials 
(NEO3 -05: May 2008 -June 2009; and NEO3- 09: July 2010 -April 2011) with 99mTc-Tilmanocept for 
breast cancer patients (Tis -T4/N0/M0) [17]. Resultantly, as of March 2013, Lymphoseek has now 
received formal FDA approval in the U nited States  for ILM during SLNB for breast cancer and for 
melanoma [1 8] with supplemental approval for guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy for clinically node 
negative squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity in June 2014 . It has been well documented in three  
prospective (but nonrandomized ) clinical trials  of Lymphoseek  [17,19, 20 ] that 99mTc-Tilmanocept, for 
early -stage breast cancer , melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has a high SNL 
localization/detection rate of   > 97 % and a low false negative rate of <  5%, demonstrating potentially 
improved performance over  that previously  reported within the historical literature for 99mTc-SC. Both 
99mTc-SC and Lymphoseek are approved radiopharmaceuticals for use in breast cancer  ILM/SLNB .  
However, to date, there is yet to be a prospective, randomized, double -blinded clinical trial that has been 
conducted at any institution in the [LOCATION_002] for directly comparing the preoperative radiotracer

99mTc-SC. 
1.1.2 Lymphoseek 
Lymphoseek is a radiopharmaceutical tracer that accumulates within lymph nodes by [CONTACT_498201]. Lymphoseek is a soluble macromolecule that has a diam eter 
in the 5 to 7 nm  range and has a molecular weight of approximately 18 kDa. Lymphoseek consists of 
multiple units of DTPA (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid) and m annose, each synthetically attached 
to a 10- kDa dextran core. Lymphoseek binds to mannose receptors ( i.e., CD206) that reside on the 
surfaces of reticuloendo thelial cells  (i.e., macrophages and dendritic cells) that specifically reside within 
lymph nodes. The m annose portion of the macromolecule acts as a ligand binding substrate for the 
mannose receptor  (i.e., CD206)  to increase uptake and retention specific ally with in lymph nodes. The 
DTPA portion of the macromolecule serves as a chelating agent for the radiolabeling of the 
macromolecule with 99mTc. The diameter of Lymphoseek is substantially smaller than that of colloid -
based radiolabeled lymph node mappi[INVESTIGATOR_498186] s, which generally have a particle diameter size range of 
< [ADDRESS_640679] 
cancer or melanoma. 
Lymphoseek is an FDA- approved radiopharmaceutical agent . 
1.1.3 99mTc-Sulfur Colloid (99mTc-SC) 
While Lymphoseek represents a synthetic, receptor -targeted  lymph node mappi[INVESTIGATOR_231505], 99mTc-SC 
represents a non-synthetic /biologic  (i.e., containing bovine gelatin),  non- specific (i.e., not receptor -
targeted) lymph node mappi[INVESTIGATOR_498187]. 
99mTc-SC is an injectable diagnostic radiopharmaceutical  agent that is indicated for:  
(1) In adult  patients only, to assist in the: (i) localization of lymph nodes draining a primary tumor in 
patients with breast cancer when used with a hand -held gamma counter; and (ii) evaluation of peritoneo-
venous (LeVeen) shunt patency in adults.  
(2) In adults and pediatric patients, for: (i) imaging areas of functioning reticuloendothelial cells in the 
liver, spleen and bone marrow ; and (ii) studies of esophageal transit and gastroesophageal reflux, and 
detection of pulmonary aspi[INVESTIGATOR_498188]. 
99mTc-SC is a n FDA- approved radiopharmaceutical agent.

2.1 Eligibility 
Up to 40 evaluable subjects (20 per cohort) will be enrolled in this trial.  Evaluable subject is defined as an 
enrolled subject who was randomized, received an injection of Lymphoseek or 99mTc-SC, went to surgery, 
and had at least one lymph node removed.  Determination of study eligibility will be established by [CONTACT_498203] s of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
The inclusion/exclusion criteria are designed to ensure that study subjects have a diagnosis of primary 
breast cancer and are candidates for surgical intervention as a treatment of breast cancer.  
Subjects who fulf ill all respective inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible for 
enrollment into the trial. Written, dated  informed consent will be obtained from all subjects. 
In the event that a subject has bilateral disease, the subject would not be randomly assigned but instead 
would receive  injections of  both radiopharmaceuticals, one in each breast.  The subject and surgeon will 
be blinded to which breast is injected with which radiopharmaceutical.

and enrolled into each group.  (Power = 0.80; p < 0.05.) 
2.2.1 Screen Failures  
Subjects who sign an informed consent form (ICF) but are ultimately not enrolled in the trial will be 
considered screen failures. Subjects will be assigned a subject identification number at the time the ICF is 
signed. Once all sc reening study procedures have been completed and eligibility has been confirmed, the 
subject will be eligible for enrollment but the subject will not be considered to be enrolled until the morning of drug administration. Demographic data and the reason for  the screen failure will be collected 
for all screen failure subjects.  
For subjects who enroll in the trial but withdraw prior to injection  of either radiopharmaceutical , 
enrollment will be extended in order to meet sample size requirements. Enrollment wil l not be extended 
for subjects who withdraw for any reason after receiving an injection of Lymphoseek.

3.2.2 Visit 2: Injection and Imaging 
Randomization assignment (see Section 4.5)  will be determined just prior to the injection visit when the 
order for the test article is placed by [CONTACT_498205].  E ither Lymphoseek or 99mTc-SC 
will be injected at Visit [ADDRESS_640688] imaging procedures for 
both agents are described below.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pre-Injection 
Prior to receiving the test agent  injection , adverse event monitoring will begin. 
Pregnancy testing for women of child bearing potential. A urine or serum pregnancy test will be collected 
before receiving the Lymphoseek or 99mTc-SC injection. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, the subject 
will be withdrawn from the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Injection of Lymphoseek and 99mTc-SC 
The appropriate dose of 99mTc used to label tilmanocept or sulfur colloid should be ordered from the 
Nuclear Medicine Department or radiolabeling facility once the subject  has been scheduled for surgery.  
Injection of Lymphoseek or 99mTc-SC will be at study time 0:00.  The only method of injection that will  
be used is a single intradermal administration.  
Intradermal Administration:   The injection dose  of 99mTc radiopharmaceutical agent will be administered 
at a dose of 0.[ADDRESS_640689] s will be asked to rate their level of discomfort using the Wong- Baker  
FACES pain rating scale [2 1], which ranges from a  minimum score of zero  (no pain)  to a maximum score 
of ten  (worst pain possible) .  The scale includes a visual analog scale with the following categories, each 
accompanied by a cartoon face indicating the level of pain:  [ADDRESS_640690] will be asked to verbally rate the 
level of pain experienced by [CONTACT_124439] a number between 0 and 10, based on this scale.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  SPECT Imaging  
The lymphoscintigraphy will be performed in two phases: (1) evaluation of the  initial rapid absorption 
and transit phase through lymphatics to the sentinel lymph node(s), (2) additional efforts to facilitate the 
exact location of the SLN for surgical excision.

Subjects will undergo standard sequential planar SPECT imaging at [ADDRESS_640691]/CT will also be performed for higher resolution imaging in 
transaxial, coronal, and sagittal planes. Vital signs (temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse rate, blood 
pressure) will be collected on each subject just prior to injection, and post- injection at  15, 30, 60 and 120 
minutes, respectively,  ± [ADDRESS_640692] will undergo surgery according to her  surgical plan  on 
the day of imaging  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Operating Room and Sur gery (Overview)  
Operating room and surgical procedures are described in Appendix F . 
The surgeon  will be provided with the preoperative imaging results.  The surgeon will perform an initial 
external survey of the subject  with the hand -held gamma detection probe and gamma detection unit in the 
operating room area and will determine the site(s) of 99mTc radiopharmaceutical agent  localization . 
Once the above image review and initial external survey are completed, the subject ’s surgical procedure 
will begin. If the planned surgery is lumpectomy the SLN survey and biop sy will occur prior to the 
lumpectom y.  Conversely, per the operating surgeon’s standard approach with mastectomy, SLN survey 
and biopsy will be completed immedia tely following the mastectomy  with a flap of mammory tissue 
remaining attached during the SLN survey and biopsy . All intraoperative data will be recorded on a 
specifically designed SLNB data collection sheet by a designated clinical research  coordinator for the 
study. All data from the specifically designed SLNB  data collection sheet form will then be transcribed 
into and maintained in a prospective SLNB  computerized database by a designated clinical research 
associate for the study.  
All excised lymph node s will be examined by a pathologist during the surgical case to determine any 
positive findings of malignancy  per frozen section.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_640693] detection and biopsy and pathology evalua tion. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Lymphoseek  and 99mTc-SC Designated  “Hot” N odes  
Ex Vivo  
Lymphoseek and 99mTc-SC positivity is based on radioactivity counts derived from the application of the 
handheld gamma probe ex vivo (excised from the subject ), where such counts must satisfy the threshold 
criterion of 10% or more of the ex vivo count of the hottest node (referred to as the “ 10% rule”)  [22]. Any 
nodal count NOT meeting this threshold criterion will be considered a negative finding (not localized).  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_640694] s will proceed to surgery for 
lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Excision of the primary tumor will be performed at the same time and  in the same 
setting.   
1. Intraoperatively, subjects  will undergo injection of VBD , unless contraindicated, (1% isosulfan 
blue) via the method and injection route of choice of the operating surgeon. Breast massage may 
be performed immediately after VBD injection.  
2. Using the handheld gamma detection system fo r three [ADDRESS_640695] the reading for the room “background” count.  Th en, identify an anatomical 
Protocol Number/Version: KHNIC -P14- 001/B  
Date:  April 29, [ADDRESS_640696] a second reading of three 2 -second counts or one 10-second count 
to to determine the “normal tissue” count to set the threshold criteria.  Three [ADDRESS_640697] s will then under go SLNB 
using a hand- held gamma detection system/probe to detect radiopharmaceutical  (“hot”) uptake 
and using visual inspection to detect blue dye (“blue”) uptake.   
5. An in vivo count will be collected prior to excision of each respective lymph node and an ex vivo 
account will be collected immediately following excision of each lymph node.  
a. A sentinel lymph node (SLN) is defined as any lymph node that was either “hot” and “blue”, “hot” only, or “blue” only, or a palpable, enlarged, hardened node.   
b. A “hot” S LN is defined as the node with the greatest number of counts based on 
radioactivity or counts derived from the application of the handheld gamma detector in 
vivo, or any node that satisfies  the 10% rule of 10% or more of the ex vivo count of the 
hottes t node . Any nodal count not meeting this 10% rule will be  considered a negative 
finding (not localized) .  
c. A “blue” S LN is defined as any lymph node that is  visibly stained blue, ha s a visible 
contiguous blue -stained afferent lymphatic, or both. Therefore, a very thorough 
evaluation of the lymphatic basin should be undertaken during the SLNB procedure. This 
should include gamma detection probe survey (for the detection of 
99mTc 
radiopharmaceutical agent localization to lymph nodes), palpation, direct visualization 
(for the detection of vital blue dye localization to lymph nodes). 
d. Digital palpation (for the detection of intraoperatively clinically grossly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665] (i.e., 
enlarged or hard) lymph nodes ) will be conducted as well . It is important to note that one 
or more SLN may be found at the time of SLNB [22]. 
6. All removed lymph nodes must  be sent to pathology for further evaluation.  Prior to any 
pathological evaluation, confirmation of ex vivo counts per tissue should be conducted. The pathological evaluation of lymph node(s) will include serial sectioning with H&E staining as well as IHC stain.  
a. In those cases in which intraoperative frozen section analysis is performed and all SLNs 
are determined to be negative for malignancy on intraoperative frozen section evaluation, 
no further removal of axillary lymph nodes will be undertaken, unless otherwise determined necessary at the discretion of the operating surgeon.  
b. In those cases in which intraoperative frozen section analysis is performed and the SLN s 
are determined to be positive for malignancy on intraoperative frozen section evaluation, 
a formal axillary lymph node dissection (levels I and II) may be performed at the 
discretion of the  operating surgeon, or may be excluded at the discretion of the operating

Date:  April 29, [ADDRESS_640698]  fits the criteria for exclusion of  formal axillary lymph node 
dissection (as based upon the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria).  
c. Any axillary lymph node that is neither “hot” or “blue”, but is determined to be 
intraoperatively clinically grossly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665] (i.e., enlarged or hard), will also be 
removed. In those cases in which any clinically grossly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_498189], a formal axillary lymph node dissection may be performed at the 
discretion of the operating surgeon.  
d. In those cases in which no SLN can be intraoperat ively identified at the time of ILM and 
SLNB procedure, a formal axillary lymph node dissection may be performed at the 
discretion of the operating surgeon.

4.3 Identification of Vital Blue Dye 
Subjects shall also undergo injection of VBD (1% isosulfan blue see Appendix C ) via the method and 
injection route of choice of the operating surgeon. Isosulfan blue is  commercially available for use as part 
of standard of care. The localization of VBD  is detected by [CONTACT_498206]. V BDs flow through the lymphatic channels/vessels, and then passively drain into the lymph 
nodes in  a non- targeted fashion, and are recognized  by [CONTACT_498207] a  blue color within the 
lymphatic channels/vessels and  the draining lymph node, making these structures visually discernible 
from surrounding tissue s. Allergic reaction to the VBDs  are rare, but have been previously reported to 
vary from 0.7% and 2.7% incidences [24 ]. 
4.4 Dosage and Administration 
Each trial participant will receive either an injection of Lymphoseek (50 µg) or 99mTc-SC with a total 
activity dose amounting to 0.[ADDRESS_640703]

Lymphoseek and 99mTc-SC will be prepared and injected intradermally according to the instructions and 
indications on the manufacturer US Structured Package Label ( See Appendix C ). 
No local anesthetic agents (such as procaine, xylocaine, lidocaine, or carbocaine) will be permitted  to be 
injected  with either radiopharmaceutical, separately , or as a part of the combined solution for injection. 
4.10 Drug  Accountability 
The investigator is responsible for accounting for all trial drug s discussed in the previous section. 
 
Each time Lymphoseek, Sulfur Colloid, and Isosulfan Blue are dispensed to subjects enrolled into this 
study, the following information at a minimum will be recorded on the Drug Accountability Log: the 
patient’s subject number, manufacturer, lot or batch number, radiolabeling facility, radiolabeled date and 
date delivered to Nuclear Medicine. At the completion or termination of the trial, a final drug 
accountability review and reconciliation must be completed, and any  discrepancies must be investigated 
and their resolution documented.

Page 20 of 33 5 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS  
5.1 Introduction 
This is a prospective, double -blind, two- treatment parallel stu dy conducted at a single study center.  Once 
screened, subjects are enrolled in the trial for a period of up to 75 days , which includes a 5 ± 3 day follow 
up period.  The objectives of the statistical analyses are to establish the effectiveness of Lymphoseek 
relative to 99mTc-SC. 
A study center is defined as a treatment administration site of group of treatment administration sites under the control and supervision of the same Primary Investigator.  
5.2 Randomization Methods  
Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study on Day 0 prior to 
surgery.  Enrolled subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: Lymphoseek or 99mTc 
Sulfur Colloid.  See section 4.[ADDRESS_640708]/CT.  Subjects will undergo standard sequential planar imaging at [ADDRESS_640709]/CT will be 
performed for higher resolution imaging in transaxial, coronal, and sagittal planes.  
5.3.2 Secondary  Efficacy Variables  
The secondary efficacy variables are:  
• Number of SLNs ide ntified in each subject  
• Gamma counts at the primary injection site in the breast and the ex vivo gamma counts of the SLNs removed  
• Pain scores  
• Pathology status of SLNs 
For the purposes of the study, an SLN is defined as a lymph node that meets the 10% rule as detailed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].  The number of SLNs will be recorded  for each subject, as well as the ex vivo gamma 
counts for each SLN removed.  The gamma counts at the injection site will also be recorded.  
Subjects will report their pain scores once during the injection procedure.  Scores will be reported on a 
scale of zero (no pain) to a maximum score of ten (worst pain possible).   
All SLNs removed will be sent  for histological evaluation according to the methods described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Each node will be characterized as positive or negative for disease. 
5.4 Safety Variables 
The safety analysis variables, collected on all subjects at the time points indicated, are as follows:

demonstrating that Lymphoseek is superior to 99mTc-SC based on the injection site clearance rate, 
assuming that the mean rate of Lymphoseek is 0.250, the mean rate of 99mTc-SC is 0.05, and the common 
standard deviation is 0.15, at least [ADDRESS_640712] an 80% chance of demonstrating that Lymphoseek is superior to 99mTc-SC based on the 
SLN upt ake rate, assuming that the mean rate of Lymphoseek is 0.1075, the mean rate of 99mTc-SC is 
0.0875, and the common standard deviation is 0.0009, at least 19 subjects will need to be enrolled in each 
treatment group.  These estimates are based on the sample size methods described in Dupont 1998. 
In order to meet the sample size requirements for each endpoint, up to 40 evaluable  subjects will be 
enrolled in the study  (see 5.7.1 intent -to-treat) .  These sample size calculations were based on a two -sided 
α=0.05 level of significance for each endpoint.       
5.6 Statistical Analyses  
The statistical analyses for the efficacy and demographic variables are described below.  Additional 
analyses of the secondary efficacy variables may be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for 
the study.  Unless otherwise stated, all hypothesis tests will be conducted using a two- sided α=0.05 (one-
sided α=0.025)  level of significance.  
 
5.6.1 Analysis Populations 
The following analysis populations will be defined.  
Intent -to-treat (ITT) Population  – The ITT population includes all enrolled subjects who were 
randomized, received an injection of Lymphoseek or 
99mTc-SC, went to surgery, and had at least 
one lymph node  removed that was confirmed to be lymph tissue and had a known disease status 
(positive or negative for disease) by [CONTACT_26745].  
Safety Population  – The safety population includes all enrolled  subjects who were randomized 
and received an injection of Lymphoseek or 
99mTc-SC.  
 The analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy variables will be conducted using the ITT population.  
The analysis of all demogra phic data will be conducted using the safety population.  All subjects will be 
analyzed according to the treatment they received.

 H
0: µLS ≤ µ SC vs.  H A: µLS > µ SC, 
 
where µ LS is the average injection site clearance rate of Lymphoseek and µ SC is the average injection site 
clearance rate of 99mTc-SC.   
SLN Uptake Rate  
The SLN uptake rate for each ITT subject will be computed using the SPECT/CT imaging data.  Gamma counts will be obtained at the injection site by [CONTACT_498208] [ADDRESS_640716]/CT will be 
performed for higher resolution imaging in t ransaxial, coronal, and sagittal planes.   Figures showing the 
percent of peak activity in the node versus time will be constructed for each radiopharmaceutical.  The average uptake rate for each radiopharmaceutical will be computed and the following test w ill be 
conducted using a two- sample t -test at a two -sided α=0.05 (one -sided α=0.025) level of significance:

where µ LS is the average SLN uptake rate of Lymphoseek and µ SC is the average SLN uptake rate of 99mTc 
Sulfur Co lloid.  
In order for the study to be successful relative to the co -primary endpoints, both of the null hypotheses for 
injection site clearance rate and SLN uptake rate must be rejected in favor of their respective alternatives.  
 
5.6.[ADDRESS_640717] will be recorded, and summary statistics (mean, 
median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) on the number of SLNs will be displayed for each 
treatment group.   
Ex Vivo and Injection Site Gamma Counts  
 
The ratio of the ex vivo gamma counts of the hottest SLN removed to the counts at the primary injection 
site in the breast will be computed for all subjects in the ITT population as follows:  
 
R = Ex vivo gamma counts of hottest SLN removed  
             Gamma counts at primary injection site  
 
If three 2 -second counts were obtained for either the ex vivo measurements or the injection site 
measurement, then the average of the counts will be used in the ratio calculation.  If one 10 -second count 
was obtained, then that single count will be used in the ratio calculation.

Page 23 of 33  
It is assumed that the ratio data of each treatment group is lognormal, therefore a log transformation (base 
e) of the data will be also performed for each subject a s follows:  
 
LnR = log e(R) 
 
Summary statistics of the ratio (R) and the log ratio (LnR) will be displayed for each treatment group and 
will include the mean, median, and standard deviation.  In addition, a 95% confidence interval for the mean ratio and the mean log ratio will be computed.   
Pain Scores  
Each subject will rate their level of discomfort using the Wong -Baker FACES pain rating scale 
immediately after injection.  The following sum maries will be computed for each treatment group: 
• Proportion of subjects with a 0 score (No Hurt) 
• Proportion of subjects with a score of 1- 2 (Hurts a Little Bit)  
• Porportion of subjects with a score of 3-4 (Hurts Little More) 
• Porportion of subjects with a s core of 5 -6 (Hurts Even More) 
• Porportion of subjects with a score of 7-8 (Hurts Whole Lot) 
• Porportion of subjects with a score of 9-10 (Hurts Worst) 
• Mean, median, standard deivation, minimum, and maximum of pain scores 
Pathology Status of SLNs 
The patholog y status of SLNs will be assessed on a per subject basis.  The number and percent of subjects 
who have at least one pathology- positive SLN will be calc ulated for each treatment group.

Page 24 of 33 6 ADVERSE EVENTS  
The occurrence of any drug- related adverse events is not expected . 
Normal r isks of nuclear medicine scans due to the injection of a  radiopharmaceuticals include allergic 
reactions, swelling, infections, intravenous injuries, bruising, pain and discomf ort. These risks, if 
encountered, would occur as the re sult of the scheduled clinical l ymphoscintigraphy or ILM.  
6.1 Definition of Adverse Event 
The term "adverse event," is synonymous with the term "adverse experience," which is used by [CONTACT_1622].  
An adverse event is any untoward, undesired, and/or unplanned clinical event in the form of signs, 
symptoms, disease, or laboratory testing , or phys iological observations occurring in a human participating 
in a clinical study with a study drug, regardless of causal relationship.  This includes the following:  
• Any clinically significant worsening of a preexisting condition. 
• Any recurrence of a preexisting condition. 
• An AE occurring from overdose of a study drug whether accidental or intentional (i.e., a dose 
higher than that prescribed by a health care professional for clinical reasons).  
• An AE occurring from abuse of a study drug (i.e., use for nonclinic al reasons)  
• An AE that has been associated with the discontinuation of the use of a study drug. 
Note:  A procedure is not an AE, but the reason for a procedure may be an AE. 
Note: Adverse ev ents are determined by [CONTACT_737]. If in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/experience an 
event (i.e. nausea in the recovery room) is expected and not uncommon for that surgery , and it is not 
deemed different in severity from other epi[INVESTIGATOR_498190],  then it is up to the 
Investigator’s discretion to d etermine the event to be adverse.  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that results in one or more of the 
following outcomes:  
• Death.  
• Life-threatening situation (see below). 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] (see below).  
• Persistent or significant disability or incapacity (see below).  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
Additionally, important medical events that m ay not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above.  Examples of such events include : allergic bronchospasm requiring intens ive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home ; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Protocol Number/Version: KHNIC -P14- 001/B  
Date:  April 29, [ADDRESS_640719] caused death had 
it occurred in a more severe form but that did not create an immediate risk of death as it actually occurred.  
For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failu re would not be 
considered life -threatening, even though drug- induced hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329320].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a criterion for considering an AE to be serious. In the absence of an AE, the participating I nvestigator should not report hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445116] a form.  
This is the case in the fo llowing situations:  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required by [CONTACT_760]. Day 
or night survey visits for biopsy or surgery required by [CONTACT_135707]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112042] a routine procedure followed by [CONTACT_188528] (e.g.,  stent removal after surgery). This should be recorded in the study file. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112043].  
In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112044] a preexisting condition that has not 
worsened does not constitute an SAE (e.g., elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a total knee replacement due to a preexisting condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened during the study). 
Disability  is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes an AE or SAE, the information is treated as an 
AE or SAE.

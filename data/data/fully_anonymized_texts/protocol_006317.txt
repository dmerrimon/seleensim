evaluate the safety and efficacy of canakinumab for the treatment 
for HIV -associated inflammation. This study will assess the safety 
and effects of canakinumab on endothelial function (assessed by 
[CONTACT_1603]-mediated vasodilation [FMD] of the brachial artery), vascular 
inflammation (assessed by [CONTACT_6789] -PET/CT scanning), key 
inflammatory markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (high -
sensitivity C -reactive protein [hsCRP]), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble 
CD163 (sCD163), D -dimer, T -cell and monocyte activation in the 
blood, and size of the HIV reservoir.  
 
DURATION  52 weeks (24 weeks of drug treatment/placebo followed by 
[CONTACT_592898]  28 weeks)

2.0 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Rationale and Background 
Need for nov el strategies to reduce inflammation in the setting of HIV infection   
By 2015, over half of HIV -infected individuals will be ≥ [ADDRESS_782201] an 
adjusted 50% increased risk of acute MI and this increased risk is present even among 
individuals with well-treated HIV3. Deaths due to CVD range from 6-15% in different HIV 
cohorts4 and HIV -infected individuals have a higher mortality from MI compared to 
 
 
Version Date: 11JAN19   12 
 control s5 as well as higher rates of sudden cardiac deat h6.  Although the contribution of 
HIV to atherosclerosis and CVD risk is becoming increasingly clear, the 
pathophysiological mechanism(s) underlying these observations are less well 
understood.  The SMART study found that untreated HIV infection was associated with 
high levels of both interleukin-6 (IL-6) and D -dimers and that these biomarkers were 
strongly associated with all -cause mortalit y7 and CVD even ts8. High sensitivity C-
reactive protein (hsCRP) , IL-[ADDRESS_782202] factor in the pathogenesis of human disease is to manipulate that factor experimentally with the aim 
of enhancing a potentially beneficial response or preventing a potentially harmful outcome.  It is expected that a better understanding of these mechanisms may help 
identify other novel interventions to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with 
HIV as well as non-AIDS conditions. These findings may also inform underlying 
mechanisms of atherosclerosis and treatment in the larger population as well.  
 
 
Inflammation may cause CVD in uninfected adults  
In the HIV -uninfected population, a strong body of evidence from over 20 cohort studies 
involving a wide range of patient populations demonstrates that markers of 
inflammation, particularly hsCRP, are strongly predictive of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) events and mortality14-18. Targeting inflammation as a means of reducing CVD 
risk was partly addressed in the JUPI[INVESTIGATOR_245039], which showed that treatment with rosuvastatin among healthy individuals with normal LDL cholesterol and elevated 
hsCRP levels reduced myocardial infarction, stroke, and all -cause mortal ity by 44%
19. 
This clinical benefit was proportional to the magnitude of hsCRP  reduction, suggesting 
that rosuvastatin was acting partly through an anti -inflammatory mechanism20. However, 
in order to implicate inflammation in atherogenesis directly, an agent that targets inflammation without lipid-lowering and with an acceptable safety profile would be required. Such an agent would be particul arly useful for patients at increased CVD risk 
on the basis of chronic inflammation rather than dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]; this may be the case for 
HIV-infected patients. 
 
The interleukin-1 family, inflammation, and atherothrombosis  
The interleukin-1 (IL-1) family which includes IL-1α, IL -1β and the IL-[ADDRESS_782203] plays a key role in mediating systemic inflammatory responses; namely 
imbalances in the IL-1β proteins which are proinflammatory and the IL-1Rα proteins 
which are anti -inflammatory are associated with clinical diseases.  For example, 
 
 
Version Date: 11JAN19   13 
 mutations in the NLRP3 inflammasome which increase the secretion of IL-1β and 
subsequently cause severe imbalances in IL-1β and IL-Rα result in autoinflammatory 
diseases such as Muckle -Wells syndrome, cryopyrin -associated periodic syndrome 
(CAPS), and neonatal -onset multisystem inflammatory disease21 and treatment with 
canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-1β has successfully treated these conditions
22. Moderate imbalances of the IL-1β system are associated with chronic 
inflammatory conditions including gout23, type [ADDRESS_782204] 
(which competitively blocks binding of IL-1β to the IL -1 receptor) precede elevations in 
troponin and CK, suggesting involvement in the pathogenesis of MI rather than being a 
consequence of myocardial necrosis29.  Among individuals with rheumatoid arthritis who 
have a high prevalence of CVD attributable to chronic inflammation similar to HIV -
infected individuals, treatment with anakinra, a IL-[ADDRESS_782205] reduced IL-6, 
hsCRP, and endothelin levels along with improving endothelial function as assessed by 
[CONTACT_1603]-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery30.   
Canakinumab trial among individuals wi thout HIV infection (CANTOS)  
Published results and safety data from the CANTOS trial has showed that in over 
10,000 individuals with prior MI and hsCRP level ≥2mg/L, canakinumab at a dose of 150 
mg every 3 months led to a significantly lower rate of cardiovascular events as 
compared to placebo (HR 0.85, 95%CI 0.74 to 0.98, p=0.021)31. Notably, most of the 
benefit was observed in those with high levels of inflammation (hsCRP ≥ 2). The 150 mg dose met the pre-specified threshold for significance for the primary and secondary endpoints (HR vs placebo 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95, P=0.005), although there was no significant difference in al l-cause mortality (HR 0.94, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.06, p=0.31).   
Additionally, in the CANTOS study, IL-1β inhibition was not associated  with increased 
risk of opportunistic infections, activation of TB or increased risk of cancers in the 
general population which suggests that canakinumab functions as an anti -inflammatory 
intervention as opposed to being immunosuppressive
32.  
Those at greatest risk for infectious disease complications include older age and the 
presence of diabetes mellitus . Participants receiving canakinumab who achieved on-
treatment IL-6 levels below the study median of 1.65ng/L had a 32% reduction in MACE, a 52% reduction in CV mortality,  and a 48% reduction in all -cause mortality (p<0.0001 
for all of these endpoints).  
As HIV patients are excluded from CANTOS, the only way to determine safety in HIV is to perform a carefully done pi[INVESTIGATOR_592883].  We will work to ensure safety in our trial by [CONTACT_592899] -infected 
adults on long-term effective antiretroviral therapy with a CD4+ T -cell count ≥ 400 
cells/mm
[ADDRESS_782206] study as outlined below.   
Safety  
 
 
Version Date: 11JAN19   14 
 We constructed a two-stage, milestone driven study. In Stage I, we will treat a small 
cohort (n=10) of carefully monitored individuals. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_592884] a 
Safety Monitoring Committee and NIH before moving on to randomized study (Stage II). 
This staged study design has been discussed extensively with NHLBI leadership, who 
support this approach. We have established protocols that were developed with experts in HIV, infectious disease, and oncology for carefully assessing the safety of 
canakinumab in the HIV -infected population.  All subjects will be followed for possible 
adverse events (AEs) throughout their involvement in the study. Routine blood work will 
be per formed on a regular basis. AEs will be graded according to the NIH/NIAID Division 
of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events. The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_592885], assess their degree of severity, and 
make a relationship assessment to study agent/intervention. Primary safety endpoints 
are detailed in the appendix and will be similar to endpoints used for our low -dose 
methotrexate study in HIV which have been carefully developed with the ACTG which 
include 1)For subjects with entry CD4+ T cell count <700 cells/mm
3, confirmed CD4+ 
decline >33% of baseline AND to <350 cells/mm3. 2)For subjects with entry CD4+ T cell 
count ≥700 cells/mm3, a confirmed CD4+ decline >50% of baseline, 3)Confirmed HIV -1 
RNA level > 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL in the absence of an interruption in ART, 4)New or recurrent 
CDC category C AIDS -indicator condition, or 5)Evidence of HIV -associated infection 
including CMV end- organ disease, varicella zoster, EBV related clinical disease.   
We will develop an independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) prior to the 
initiation of the study. The final structure of this committee will be determined with input 
from NIH. We have recruited [CONTACT_592936], Vice-Chair of the AIDS Clinical Trials 
Group (ACTG) from UCLA, [CONTACT_592937], a cardiologist with expertise in clinical 
trials and vascular function at the Mayo Graduate School of Medicine, [CONTACT_592938], a physician scientist with expertise in infectious diseases at University of 
[LOCATION_007], [CONTACT_148011] chael Lederman, a physician with expertise in infectious diseases at Case 
Western Reserve University, [CONTACT_592939], director of infectious disease research 
at Atlanta VA Medical Center and [CONTACT_592940], an infectious disease physician with 
research expertise in HIV and cardiovascular disease from the University of Minnesota 
(see letters of support). These individuals were selected based on their expertise in 
either the clinical management of HIV infection and/or their expertise with clinical  trials. 
The committee will be chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124].  Currier who has experience in the regulatory 
aspects of clinical trials.   
The SMC will meet quarterly during the study and at approximately [ADDRESS_782207] person in Stage I has been dosed. The dec ision to move to Stage II will be 
made by [CONTACT_4484]. A study data coordinator will produce administrative reports after 
completion of each cohort describing study progress including the following: (1) accrual, 
(2) demographics, (3) study subject status, and (4) number and type of serious AEs. The 
SMC will review study progress, efficacy data, all interim and total AEs, and 
unanticipated problems involving risk to participants. Reviews will be communicated to the UCSF Committee on Human Research (CHR), study s ponsor, and/or federal 
agencies, as appropriate. The SMC will have access to treatment assignment. The 
study will be discontinued if the SMC determines that it is in the best interest of the 
subjects.

the trial. Grade 1 or 2 AEs will not result in any change to our study plans. If there is 
evidence for a Grade 3 AE that is not caused by [CONTACT_5257], the study will continue 
as planned. On the other hand, Grade 3 AEs thought to be possibly caused by [CONTACT_592900] 4 AEs will result in a hold on any future enrollments until a decision to proceed or to stop the study is made by [CONTACT_4484], the NIH, and [COMPANY_001].
 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments:  
There are no known drug-drug interactions with canakinumab. There are theoretical 
concerns that antibody -mediated reductions in inflammation may affect drug 
metabolizing enzymes such as CYP450. Elevated IL-[ADDRESS_782209]. Aweeka’s  guidance, we plan to assess PK and carry out ART 
concentration measurements as troughs in N=60 subjects at 6 timepoints as shown in Table 1 which includes measurements prior to initiating and during treatment with 
canakinumab/placebo.  For each trough sample collection,  subjects will have PK trough 
levels drawn in the study clinic and will be instructed to hold their morning ART dose on the day of visit. Precise information on timing of the prior [ADDRESS_782210]. Aweeka’s l aboratory has extensive experience in ART 
quantitation
35-41. Methods are optimized and fully validated to permit quantification of all 
analytes at the sensitivity necessary for clinical PK evaluations. Inter - and intra-day 
coefficients of variation for all assays are consistently within 10%. PK trough estimates in [ADDRESS_782211] commonly prescribed ART (e.g. atazanavir and efavirenz) will be compared 
between subjects receiving canakinumab to those subjects receiving placebo.

measures of systemic and vascular inflammation and endothelial function (all indicators 
of cardiovascular risk) in treated and suppressed HIV infected individuals.  In Stage I of 
our study, we will administer  canakinumab as a single dose (150mg) by [CONTACT_371860] 10 individuals on stable antiretroviral regimens with undetectable plasma 
HIV RNA levels using conventional assays.  Based on safety data from the CANTOS 
study, we anticipate that this dose will be well tolerated and safe.  In Stage II of our 
study, if the drug is well tolerated, we will continue enrolling patients for N=100 individuals and individuals will get two doses of 150mg (at baseline and 12 weeks).  The 
pathogenesis -oriented approach will improve our understanding of the underlying 
mechanisms of the accelerated atherosclerosis observed in individuals with HIV infection, including the potential roles of inflammation and immune activation. By [CONTACT_592901]-
1β inhibition, we will establish specific mechanistic links between HIV infection and its

 leading non-HIV cause of death, CVD.  The results of this proof -of-concept trial could be 
potentially paradigm -shifting in this field; while the majority of studies to reduce HIV -
related inflammation have focused solely on antiretroviral medication, the anti -
inflammatory features of canakinumab can be applied to a variety of different disease 
manifestations in HIV. Theoretically, any intervention that decreases inflammation and T cell proliferation will result in a smaller reservoir.  Thus IL-1β inhibition using 
canakinumab may have broad clinical implications for HIV -infected individuals favorably 
impacting HIV reservo irs and potentially leading to viral eradication and ultimately cure 
of HIV. 
 
2.3  Hypothesis  
Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) prolongs life, it does not fully restore health. For reasons that remain poorly defined, HIV -infected adults on otherwise effective therapy 
have a higher than expected risk of a number of “non-AIDS” conditions, including cardiovascular disease. Chronic inflammation predicts and possibly contributes to this risk. Although markers of T cell activation were dominant predictors in  the era of untreated 
HIV disease, the most powerful and consistent predictors of morbidity in the modern ART era are those which reflect chronic activation of monocyte/macrophage systems. IL-6, 
sCD14, sCD163 and frequency of circulating monocytes with an activated phenotype 
have been found in multiple studies to be elevated in treated HIV disease and associated 
with increased risk of morbidity/mortality. Many of these pathways have also been 
associated with vascular dysfunction. These data collectively support a model in which a 
number of factors (e.g., mic robial translocation, dysbiosis ) activate 
monocyte/macrophages, leading eventually to vascular disease and end-organ tissue 
damage. There is ample precedent for this cardiovascular disease model in the ge neral 
population, where resident inflammatory macrophages in vessels are central to the 
pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesions and vascular dysfunction.  We hypothesize that 
canakinumab administered at a dose of 150mg subcutaneously every [ADDRESS_782213] that canakinumab-mediated inhibition of IL-1B signaling 
will reduce levels of CD4+ T cell activation, cell -associated RNA and cell -associated DNA.
 
2.[ADDRESS_782214] excluded those patients 60 years old or older.  In 
clinical trials involving adults and children (ages 2-17 years), the most frequently reported 
adverse drug reactions were infections predominantly of the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_592886]: 11JAN19   [ADDRESS_782215] adequate CD4+ T -cell counts and suppressed HIV prior to 
enrollment. CD4+ T cell counts and HIV -1 RNA titers will be measured frequently, as in 
the schedule of events.   In clinical trials, injection site reactions were mild (10% of the 
clinical trial population) to moderate (less than 2% of the clinical trial population).  No 
severe injection site reactions have been reported.  Common toxicities associated with 
canakinumab also include, diarrhea,  upper abdominal pain, headache, vertigo, and 
nausea. These will be queried by [CONTACT_592902].  
No hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with canakinumab therapy but we will 
exclude individuals if they  have a known clinical hypersensitivity to the medication.   
As canakinumab may affect the immune response to live vaccines and no data are 
available on the efficacy of live vaccines in individuals receiving canakinumab, adults 
would receive all recommended vaccines prior to initiation of therapy with canakinumab, 
and we will exclude any individual who has a requirement for live vaccines during the 
study.   
Canakinumab has also been associated with a reduction in neutrophil count22.  In a phase 
IIb study of 556 individuals, 10.7% of canakinumab treated patients and 4.6% of placebo 
patients had some neutropenia during the trial defined as an ANC < 1500/mm32. For this 
reason, we will exclude all individuals with ANC< 1500/mm and carefully monitor WBC 
and ANC during the study.     
There may be temporary mild discomfort when the blood pressure cuff is inflated from the 
endothelial function studies.  Some patients may feel weak or get a headache after taking 
the nitroglycerin medication which is also temporary.  There is a risk of death if subjects 
are taking Viagra-like drugs and also take nitroglycerin at the same time; therefore 
subjects who have taken Viagra- like drugs within [ADDRESS_782216]’s physician and arrangements will be made to perform additional imaging or evaluation if clinically indicated.   Phlebotomy may cause some 
discomfort, bleeding or bruising where the needle enters the skin, and rarely, fainting or infection may occur.  No more than 480 ml (2 cups) of blood will be drawn over any two-
 
 
Version Date: 11JAN19   18 
 month period. This is within Red Cross Guidelines (less than 500 ml every two 
months).  Risks of blood collection include anemia (low blood counts).  Symptoms of 
anemia include tiredness, weakness and dizziness. Patients will be checked for anemia 
at each visit.  If the investigator feels that an individual is at signif icant risk for anemia, the 
amount of blood collected will be reduced.  If the study participant’s hemoglobin falls 
below 9 g/dl or hematocrit falls below 27%, we will draw a 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of blood 
drawn to check the hemoglobin and hematocrit.  Other th an the blood required to check 
the hemoglobin and hematocrit, there will not have more blood drawn until the hemoglobin 
rises above 9 g/dl or the hematocrit rises above 27%.  
The effects of canakinumab on an unborn baby [CONTACT_592903].  Female subjects of 
childbearing age and pregnant or nursing women will be excluded from the study. Male 
subjects will be counseled to use two forms of birth control during the study.    
Other side effects that are not known at this time could occur during study treatment.  All 
drugs have a potential risk of an allergic reaction, which if not treated promptly, could 
become life-threatening.  During the course of the study, subjects will be told about any 
new information that may affect their decision to continue to participate.  
Benefits  
Although ART for patients with HIV prolongs life, it does not fully restore health.  Several 
factors contribute to the excess CVD risk observed in patients with HIV, including chronic inflammation and immune activation.  Thus, therapeutic strategies to target inflammation 
and immune activation in the setting of HIV infection may reduce CVD risk, leading to improved survival.  We will perform the first study ever to evaluate the effects of an anti -
inflammatory treatment strategy via IL-1B inhibition that does not affect traditional CVD 
risk factors and is not an HIV antiretroviral medication on endothelial function, 
inflammation, and immune activation in individuals with HIV infection.  Treatment of 
inflammation, other than through use of ART or lipid-lowering medications is a novel 
approach to reducing CVD risk in patients with HIV, and could potentially change 
preventive cardiology treatment paradigms in these patients by [CONTACT_592904] -reducing interventions used in patients with and without HIV 
infection.
 
While receiving the study drug, there is no anticipated benefit for patients participating in 
this exploratory study .

recruited from the SCOPE study or co -enrolled in the SCOPE study. SCOPE is 
an ongoing prospective cohort of over 2000 HIV -infected adults and over 600 
individuals meet the entry criteria for this study ensuring rapid recruitment. 
Advantages of using SCOPE to perform our proposed study include: (1) the ability to leverage existing funds to support the proposed research; (2) rapid 
recruitment of eligible subjects from a well -characterized cohort; and (3) reliance 
on an established infrastructure for patient retention, data collection, laboratory 
testing, and data management.  
 Quest Clinical Research will recruit from their cohort as well as screen referrals 
from sub -investigators.
 
Prior to conducting any study -related activities, written informed consent and the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) author ization must 
be signed and dated by [CONTACT_423]. The date of enrollment is the date the 
participant signs the informed consent form.

7.1.[ADDRESS_782270] should be reevaluated closely 
until the AE returns to Grade ≤2, at which time study treatment may be 
reintroduced at the discretion of the site investigator or according to standard 
practice. Subjects experiencing Grade 3 AEs requiring permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment should be followed closely for resolution of 
the AE to Grade ≤[ADDRESS_782271] study

• Reaching a primary safety endpoint (defined in section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
• Completion of treatment as defined in the protocol.  
• Request by [CONTACT_31125].  
• Clinical reasons believed life threatening by t he physician, even if not addressed in 
the toxicity section of the protocol.  
• Not taking ART for [ADDRESS_782278] of possible reasons for study treatment discontinuation:

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues  
This is a double-blind, 52 week study to evaluate if treating virologically suppressed 
HIV-infected individuals with canakinumab is safe and reduces CVD risk as 
measured by [CONTACT_592915] -associated inflammation.  
Due to the lack of safety data on canakinumab in patients with HIV, we will perform our study in two stages.  In Stage I, 10 individuals will all receive 150mg 
canakinumab once and undergo followup for 12 weeks.  
 
9.2 Endpoints  
9.2.1 Primary Endpoints

decline >33% of baseline and to an absolute value <350 cells/mm3 
• For subjects with an entry CD4+ T -cell count ≥700 cells/mm3, a confirmed CD4 
decline >50% of baseline

baseline to week 18  
[IP_ADDRESS] Markers related to CVD risk, inflammation, and coagulation  
Changes from baseline to week 24 in levels of hsCRP, IL-6, s CD163, 
and D -dimer.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Markers of monocyte subpopulations, adhesion and activation indices, 
and CX3CR1 expression  
Change from baseline to week 24 in monocyte levels, adhesion and 
activation indices, and CX3CR1 expression.   
9.2.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory soluble and cellular biomarkers  
Change from baseline to week 24.  
NOTE:  The final choice of soluble and cellular biomarkers to be 
evaluated will be determined closer to the time of analysis 
based on the current state of knowledge and interest at that 
time. Biomarkers currently of interest include:  
• Inflammation, coagulation, and microbial translocation: sCD14, IP -10, tissue factor, and 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)  
• Monocyte activation: Expression of CD14 and CD16, their activat ion marker (CD69) 
and homing molecule (CX3CR1) expression  
• Immune activation: CD38+HLA -DR+ expression on peripheral CD4+ and CD8+  
 
 
Version Date: 11JAN19   45 
 • Immune senescence: CD57+CD28+ expression on peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ cells  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reactivation of latent CMV and CMV replicat ion 
Qualitative (detectable and undetectable) and quantitative CMV DNA

9.3 Randomization and Stratification 
Study participants will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion in a 2:1 ratio of 
canakinumab to placebo.  A blocked randomization scheme will be generated using 
SAS Proc PLAN.  
9.4 Sample Size and Accrual  
Power calculations (Aim 1):  All power calculations were performed using SAS, 
version 9.3 (SA S Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]) for 80% power, with all 
calculations assuming a two-tailed α=0.05.  
Stage I : The primary focus of the initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_592893]. Rates of AEs will be tabulated, with exact confidence intervals. With [ADDRESS_782280] the occurrence of rare events is 
limited; however, common toxicities are likely to be detected. If none of the 10 
subjects getting active treatment experience any AEs, then the upper confidence 
bound for the probability of having an AE would be 31% (using an exact binomial 
interval); hence, we would have strong evidence that the probability of having an AE 
is less than 50%.
 
 
 
Version Date: 11JAN19   46 
 The sample size was determined based on the primary endpoint for endothelial 
function, while at the same time ensuring that the study will be well powered to 
demonstrate the safety of the intervention.  
9.4.1  Endothelial Function  
Based on a superiority trial design with two-sided α=0.05, assuming a 
standard deviation (SD) of 3% and a 10% drop out rate, a sample size of 100 
participants (67 active, 33 placebo) will ensure 80% power to detect a between- groups difference of 1.9%. An effect size of 1.5-2% change in FMD is 
considered clinically relevant and is detectable with brachial artery FMD studies of this siz e
42. This magnitude of FMD improvement has been seen in 
studies of ART43 and statins44, 45 in patients with HIV -infection. In t he 
Cardiovascular Health Study46 a 1% FMD difference was associated with an 
~14% adjusted CVD risk reduction.  
 9.4.2 Vascular Inflammation  
We will also measure between-treatment arm differences in the change aortic TBR (the measure of arter ial inflammation by [CONTACT_10052]/CT). The assumed SD for 
change in TBR is 0.18; this value is derived from Elkhwad et al
47 and takes 
into account the multi -center nature of PET/CT  measurements in this study. 
That SD is chosen conservatively, since it is for change in TBR from the aorta and carotid arteries combined (which is a secondary endpoint in this 
application, and which is associated with a larger SD for change compared to 
single-vessel endpoints). Based on previous work in a comparable cohort by 
[CONTACT_69517]
12, the anticipated average baseline value in our cohort will 
be approximately 2.23. Based on a superiority trial design with two-sided α=0.05, a total of 82 subjects entering and 66 subjects providing complete, evaluable data sets will ensure 93% power to detect a between-groups 
difference of 0.156 (which is 7% of a mean baseline TBR value of 2.23). The 
minimum meaningful expected change on therapy of 7% is based on the 
observation that low -dose and moderate dose statins are associated with 
~8%
48 and ~19%49 reduction in TBR, respectfully. Of note, the SD for change 
in TBR for the aorta, the primary endpoint in this application, is smaller 
(0.14)[ADDRESS_782281] larger residual power than calculated 
here.  
9.4.3  Safety – Stage II:  
Safety of active treatment will be demonstrated if it can be shown that active 
treatment provides no more than an 18% point absolute higher rate of safety events than the background rate. That is, a non-inferiority hypothesis on the 
difference in the proportions of subjects with safety events between the 
groups utilizing a non- inferiority bound of 18%. 
 
Assuming an underlying true probability of safety endpoints of 8% with 
placebo compared to 10% with treatment, accepting a one-sided 10% type 1 
error rate,  and assuming 10% dropout rate, a sample size of 30 subjects in 
placebo group and 60 subjects in treatment group will provide 80% power to 
 
 
Version Date: 11JAN19   47 
 demonstrate that the difference in the probability of a safety endpoint 
between the two treatment strategies is less than 18%.   
The power of the study to rule out a 18 percentage point (absolute) increase 
in the probability of a safety event over 24 weeks will be adversely impacted if the true event probability in the placebo group is higher than that assumed or 
if treat ment results in more than an absolute 2 percentage point increase in 
the event probability (Figure 9.1).  
Figure 9.1: Power to exclude a difference in the 24 week probability of safety events (canakinumab – placebo) of 18 percentage points (absolute) or greater with a sample size 
of N=30 in placebo and N=60 in canakinumab group. 
 
 
9.4.4 Viral Reservoir Studies  
A sample size of 30 subjects in placebo and 60 in canakinumab group will 
provide sufficient precision to estimate the difference in the proportion of  
subjects with undetectable viremia between the two groups with a 95% 
confidence interval with maximal width of 0.30 (+/ -0.15).

 The study will undergo quarterly reviews for safety by [CONTACT_592917] (SMC) that includes [CONTACT_592941], [CONTACT_592942], [CONTACT_592943], [CONTACT_245174], 
[CONTACT_592944] and [CONTACT_83677].   
9.6 Analysis Plan  
9.6.1 Safety 
 
Analytic plan:  We will compare baseline characteristics by [CONTACT_1570] 
(canakinumab vs. placebo) using a t -test for normally distributed variables 
and using the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables that are non-
normally distributed, and Fisher’s exact test f or categorical variables.  
Analyses for aim 1 will involve comparisons of continuous measures at multiple visits following treatment initiation (through week 52 ). We will use 
linear mixed models to evaluate the association of treatment group with CD4 
count  and HIV RNA level, in separate models for each outcome. Because 
these measures are known to be right -skewed, each outcome will be log-
transformed for analysis; results will be back -transformed to produce 
estimated percentage differences by [CONTACT_1570]. To account for the 
possibility of missing data due to loss to follow -up or study discontinuation, 
which could bias the treatment effect, we will adjust estimates using an 
inverse probability weighting approach
51. We will model each participant’s 
probability of having a non-missing outcome, with separate weights 
calculated at each visit. The inverse of this probabi lity will then be used as a 
weight applied to persons with non-missing outcomes in the regression 
analyses.   
 
9.6.2 Secondary/Exploratory Outcomes  
Primary inference for all remaining continuous study outcomes will be based 
on a comparison of the change in the endpoints from baseline to week [ADDRESS_782283] rank. T hese results 
will be supported by [CONTACT_592918]. For all analyses, missing outcome data assumed to be ignorable.  
All analyses will be presented with longitudinal scatter plots of observed 
changes by [CONTACT_592919]-sided 95% confidence intervals of the 
within group changes and differences in changes between the two study 
groups. The proportions of subjects with detectable HIV -1 RNA levels, and 
detectable CMV will be plotted over time and compared by [CONTACT_592920] 18/24 using Fisher’s exact test. Given sufficient numbers of individuals 
with detectable levels of HIV -[ADDRESS_782284] 8 weeks versus none will be 
performed for all endpoints.

The UCSF Data Coordinating Center was created to develop and support data 
management systems for clinical researchers.  The web-based systems currently in 
use encompass all aspects of a clinical research study's life cycle. They are utilized 
by [CONTACT_34677], medi um and large-sized studies both within and outside UCSF.  The 
standard research data system is a customized hybrid of off -the-shelf software that 
combines decentralized data submission, centralized and remote data editing, and a 
centralized database struct ure designed to collect, transfer, and store data for 
clinical research studies.  The system integrates scannable forms with Internet 
capabilities to provide rapid and timely access to highly accurate data.  In this 
system, data are collected and transmitt ed via the Internet to the Coordinating 
Center by [CONTACT_592921]. After the data have been electronically received by 
[CONTACT_5081], they are assessed for quality via a combination of automated and manual processes and then written to the study database, which has 
a powerful and flexible data dictionary for subsequent query generation. Every 24 
hours, queries (data discrepancies) are generated to identify potential errors in the 
study data. These queries are accessible via a secure study web site so that clinic staff can immediately resolve them in a timely manner. When appropriate, sites can 
audit data in real -time via the web site, which automatically generates a full audit 
trail. Data from outside sources such as participating laboratories are integrated into 
the study database. The ultimate result is elimination of delays in identifying missing data, improved data quality, and faster time to data analysis.  The standard system 
includes a password- protected study web site which can be accessed from 
anywhere in the world for administrative coordination and data operations. The 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_592894]: administrative (meeting 
planner, document archives), data system support (user manuals, Q&A), forms 
tracking, querying and editing reports, and other types of reporting (recruitment, retention, editing).  Finally, the standard system is compliant with all Federal 
 
 
Version Date: 11JAN19   [ADDRESS_782286]. Hsue’s cardiovascular 
studies.  These forms collect data regarding antiretroviral medication usage and 
adherence, quality of life, recreational drug use, HIV transmission beha viors and 
traditional cardiac risk factors.  Study forms are created using Teleform Elite 
software (Cardiff Corp., Vista, CA) and are transmitted via an internet scanner to the 
Data Coordinating Center, where they are read by [CONTACT_592922] a Microsoft SQL-server database. After human verification of key text 
fields, an automated error and consistency -checking algorithm is performed, and all 
errors resolved on- line in real time by [CONTACT_592923].  Data from outside 
sources such as participating laboratories are integrated into the study database. 
The ultimate result is elimination of delays in identifying missing data, improved data 
quality, and faster time to data analysis. The standard system is compliant with all 
Federal Government confidentiality guidelines.  
 
Questionnaire development . All study participants will complete interviewer - and self -
administered questionnaires developed for this study.  These forms will collect data 
regarding antiretroviral medication usage and adherence, as well as quality of life, 
recreational drug use, and HIV transmission behaviors.  Study forms will be created 
using Teleform Elite software (Cardiff Corp., Vista, CA) and eventually transmitted 
via an internet scanner form our clinical research sites to the UCSF Data 
Coordinating Center, which is located s everal miles away.   Using an established 
system, these forms will be read by [CONTACT_592922] a 
Microsoft SQL -server database. After human verification of key text fields, an 
automated error and consistency -checking algorithm wi ll be performed, and all errors 
reported the next day on the study’s password- protected website where they are 
resolved on- line by [CONTACT_592923].   
 
Instruments for this study will be developed based upon existing questionnaires used 
in the SCO PE cohort.  Data obtained from these forms will be will be housed using 
the same variable labels and coding in our existing SCOPE database, thus eliminating substantial start up time and expense on database 
development.  Detailed questionnaires similar to that in SCOPE will be administered 
at baseline and at the primary outcome visits.   We will also develop shorter forms to 
be given at the interim visits.   These forms will contain a standard set of questions 
addressing the following domains: 
 
 
 
Version Date: 11JAN19   51 
 Demographic characteristics.  At baseline and annually thereafter, we will obtain 
information on race/ethnicity (baseline only), education, employment, income, and 
residence.   
General health.  Participants will be asked about the occurrence and degree of 
severity of a list of 20 symptoms developed by [CONTACT_163426].   This index is widely used 
in ongoing studies throughout the world.  It includes symptoms commonly related to 
antiretroviral therapy.  Information will also be obtained regarding emergency room 
use and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149993].  
HIV-related history .  Participant’s self -reported last known negative HIV antibody test 
and first known positive test will be obtained.  Self-reported CD4+ T -cell nadir will 
also be recorded, but this will be supplemented by [CONTACT_592924] t he each 
participant’s medical chart.  A focused chart review will also obtain all plasma HIV 
RNA and CD4+ T -cell counts performed since entry into clinic.   
AIDS -related diagnoses .  Participants will be asked about the occurrence of any 
AIDS -defining diagn osis listed in the [ADDRESS_782287] 4 days (asking about each day separately) and the total number of dosages 
missed in the prior [ADDRESS_782288] records, including consent forms, CRFs, supporting data, laboratory 
specimen records, and medical records (physician progress notes, nurses’ notes, 
individuals’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332]), to ensure protection of study subjects, compliance with the protocol, and accuracy and completeness of records.  The monitors also will inspect 
sites’ regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements are being followed and 
sites’ pharmacies to review product storage and management . 
11.2 Adverse Event Reporting 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of 
a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease 
temporally associated with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational product. 
 
 
 
Version Date: 11JAN19   52 
 A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any AE that results in any of the following 
outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Study 
sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per UCSF 
CHR Guidelines .  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed consent is 
obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.  
All subjects will be followed for possible adverse events throughout their involvement in 
the study.  At each interaction study personnel will elicit subject input as to discomforts 
or adverse experiences while taking the medications.  Subjects will be seen and 
interviewed by a study nurse at screening, day 0, and weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12,  13, 14, 15, 
16, 18, 24,  30, 36, 40, 48 and 52. At each visit, they will b e assessed for any new 
symptoms and vital signs will be obtained.  A complete blood count, complete metabolic 
panel, CD4+ T cell count, and plasma HIV -[ADDRESS_782289] 
visits.  Subjects will also be seen after study drug administration is completed on week 
24 ([ADDRESS_782290] dose).    
Adverse events will be reported within 10 working days of the Investigator’s awareness 
of the event, according to UCSF CHR Guidelines. Adverse events will be described by 
[CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the cause.  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after 
informed consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed. If a subject is withdrawn from treatment due to an adverse event, the 
subject will be followed by [CONTACT_41848].
 
12.[ADDRESS_782291] (IRB) Rev iew and Informed Consent  
All protocols receive approval from the Committee on Human Research, UCSF’s institutional review board.  The consent process is conducted in accordance with the 
division’s SOP, which is based on GCP and HHS guidelines.  All staff a t PHP have 
completed the NIH computer based-training on the Protection of Human Research Subjects.  Certificates for this training are on file.  In addition, all staff have 
completed the Human Subject Protections online course developed by [CONTACT_25999].  In 
accord ance with HIPAA regulations, subjects will be identified by a four -digit code 
(as is currently done in SCOPE).  
 
 
Research staff will ensure that candidates understand all elements of the consent form by [CONTACT_592925], study intervention, basic procedures, risks, and that participation is voluntary.  Subjects will be given as much ti me as they need 
to read, understand and sign the approved informed consent document.  The subject 
will receive a signed/dated copy of the consent form to keep along with the UCSF Subject Bill of Rights and the HIPPA form to keep. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_782292] Confidential ity 
 
 
Version Date: 11JAN19   53 
 All biologic specimens and clinical data obtained from this study will be linked to this 
code and not to personal identifying information (e.g., name, social security number, 
medical record number).  A key which will link the four -digit code to the per sonal 
information will be maintained in a secure pass -word protected file maintained by [INVESTIGATOR_124].

HIPAA Compliance:  All sites are committed to ensuring that appropriate measures 
are taken to protect the privacy and confidentiality of all Personally -Identifiable 
Health Information (PHI) for which it is responsible.  This includes compliance with 
all regulations set forth by [CONTACT_36869], as well as with existing State and 
Federal laws pertaining to PHI.  All entering study volunteers will be given a copy of 
the Notice of Privacy Practices.  Good faith efforts will be made to obtain each 
individual’s written acknowledgement of receipt of the Notice(s).  The rights 
mandated by [CONTACT_592926]’s ability  to access, 
amend, and disclose certain sections of his or her own PHI are fully respected, and every effort will be made to assist patients who choose to exercise these rights. 
12.[ADDRESS_782293] Recruitment  
Recruitment of eligible subjects will be greatly aided by [CONTACT_592927], clinic -based cohort study of HIV -infected adults (the “Study of the Consequences of 
the Protease Inhibitor Era,” or SCOPE (S. Deeks, PI, H8211-[ZIP_CODE])).  To date, 
SCOPE ha s enrolled over 2000 subjects: over [ADDRESS_782294]. Felicia Sterman, a HIV physician in the community will refer individuals to the 
study.  
  
When a protocol opens to accrual, our group initiates a large-scale education effort to inform both providers and patients about study aims, requirements, and 
procedures. Drs. Hsue and Deeks maintain a large primary care clinic and are in the 
clinic nearly every day.   
12.4 Subjec t Compensation 
Subjects will receive reimbursements to cover costs related to the study. They will receive the following amounts for each procedure: $25 at the completion of each 
study visit that does not include imaging,  $25 for each FMD and $100 for each FDG -

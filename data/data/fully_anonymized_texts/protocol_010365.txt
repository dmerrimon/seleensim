The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic is a major public health crisis. As a bridge to 
specific vaccine development and rollout, we urgently need to deploy practical, affordable and 
effective interventions that prevent infection and / or mitigate the severity of COVID -19. The CROWN  
(COVID -19 Research Outcomes Worldwide Network) COLLABORATIVE  is an international, 
transdisciplinary, research network, established to assess rigorously and efficiently promising 
interventions for COVID -19. CROWN CORONAT ION (COVID -19 Research Outcomes Worldwide 
Network for  CORONA virus preven TION ) is a Bayesian, pragmatic, participant -level randomized, multi-
center, and international placebo -controlled platform trial, assessing candidate interventions that 
either modify th e host immune response or target the virus implicated in COVID -19 - severe acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] -2 (SARS -CoV-2). The objective of CROWN CORONATION is the 
prevention of symptomatic COVID -19 by [CONTACT_515856],  with 
complementary mechanisms of action. The primary outcome of CROWN CORONATION is symptomatic 
COVID -19 by [CONTACT_4475] 60 after commencement of study intervention (i.e. any of the following: cough, 
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, musc le pain, sore throat, new loss of taste or 
smell, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) with laboratory confirmation (i.e. based on viral polymerase chain 
reaction). The study design is scientifically compelling and ethically robust. Study arms that are ‘under-
performing’ may be discontinued, and additional prophylactic arms may be added. Thi s efficient 
approach can limit participant allocation to futile or even harmful study arms. The CROWN COLLABORATIVE has partners across the translational continuum, spanning foundational basic science discovery, proof- of-principle human research, pragmatic  effectiveness trials, and public health focused 
implementation science.

 2 Summary  
 
Objectives:  Primary Objective:  
To determine the effectiveness of the trial intervention(s) in 
preventing symptomatic (i.e. any of the following: cough, 
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, muscle 
pain, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell, nausea, vomiting, or 
diarrhea), laboratory test -confirmed COVID -19 in adults  with 
repeated exposures to SARS -CoV-2 by [CONTACT_4475] 60 after receiving trial 
intervention s. 
Secondary objectives:  
1. To determin e the effectiveness of the trial interventions(s) in 
preventing symptomatic ( i.e. any of the following: cough, 
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, muscle 
pain, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell, nausea, vomiting, 
or diarrhea), laboratory test -confirmed COVID -19 in adults 
with repeated exposures to SARS -CoV-2 by [CONTACT_4475] 150 after 
receiving trial interventions.  
2. To determine the effectiveness of the trial interventions in 
mitigating the severity of COVID -19 in adults  who become 
infected with SARS -CoV-2 by [CONTACT_4475] 60 after receiving trial 
intervention . Severity will be graded on a simplified version of 
the ordinal WHO COVID -19 severity scale.  
3. To determine the effectiveness of the trial interventions in mitigating the severity of COVID -19 in adults who become 
infected with SARS -CoV-2 by [CONTACT_4475] 150 after receiving trial 
interventions. Severity will be graded on a simplified version of the ordinal WHO COVID -19 severity scale.  
 
4. To determine the effectiveness of the trial interventions in 
preventing/reducing the incidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection (by 
[CONTACT_44898]) over up to 150 days ( 5 months ) of follow -up (see trial 
duration per participant below).  
Type of trial:  An international, randomized, placebo -controlled, Bayesian 
platform clinical trial. Frequent interim analyses will be performed 
in a Bayesian manner to modify the trial early for overwhelming 
evidence of efficacy, futility or harm, using pre -specified 
thre sholds.  
Trial design and methods:  Participants will be randomized to receive trial interventions.  
Trial duration per 
participant: Participants will be followed up  for 150 days  from randomization . 
Participants who complete 60  days of follow up  (primary outcome 
ascertainment) will be followed up for a further 3 months  (i.e. a 
total o f 150 days ( 5 months ) of participant follow -up). 
Estimated total trial 
duration:  [ADDRESS_668457] 2021        Page 14 of 46 
 Planned trial sites:  Participants will be recruited from sites in Canada, Ghana, India, 
Ireland, South Africa, [LOCATION_006], [LOCATION_003], Zambia, and Zimbabwe, as well as 
other possible countries  
Total number of 
participants planned: There is no fixed pre -specified target for enrolment .  
The Bayesian design includes frequent interim analyses; stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_515818], harm or futility are specified. It is likely that no 
more than 30,000 participants will be included overall.  
Main inclusion/exclusion 
criteria:  Inclusion criteria  
1. Volunteers without clinical evidence of COVID -19 infection 
aged 18 years and older.  
2. Participants who are at high risk of SARS -CoV- 2 infection, 
defined as adults whose locations or circumstances put 
them at appreciable risk of exposure to SARS -CoV- 2 and 
COVID -19. (see country specific addendum if needed to define 
further)  
3. Must have a mobile phone and access to the Internet for data collection purposes.  
4. Participants who are willing and able to provide informed consent via an electronic consent process.  
Exclusion criteria  
5. Weight outside range 50 kg – 120 kg  (110 lbs – 265 lbs).  
6. Self-reported or laboratory confirmed previous or current 
diagnosis of  SARS- CoV-2. 
7. Self-reported current acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416].  
8. Concurrent and/or recent use of  the investigational product, a 
product considered to be equivalent to the investigational product, or any other product that is likely to interfere with the 
inve stigational products in this trial or the interpretation of trial 
data  .  
9. Self-reported known allergies to any of the IMPs and excipi[INVESTIGATOR_515819].  
10. Self-reported presence or history of the conditions  listed in the 
appendices . 
11. Self-reported current use of medication with known to interact 
with any of the m edications listed in the appe ndices . 
12. Inability or unwillingness to be followed up for the trial period . 
Statistical methods and 
analysis: The analysis of the primary endpoint will be by [CONTACT_515857], adjusting for age as fixed effect, and sites as random effects. The secondary severity endpoint will be analyzed by [CONTACT_515858], with the same adjustment strategy. Interim analyses will be performed regularly for efficacy, 
futility and harm.     
 
  
Core -CROWN CORONATION Protocol V8.0, dated [ADDRESS_668458] few months, a health crisis wrought by [CONTACT_410944][INVESTIGATOR_18960] -2 (SARS -CoV-2) has swept the world, taking a massive toll on people and nations; it has 
inflicted substantial societal and economic devastation, and threatens to overwhelm healthcare 
systems. This new deadly contagion has an estimated overall infection fatality rate of up to 2%.1 It is a 
zoonotic infection that crossed to humans in late 2019, it rapi[INVESTIGATOR_515820], and it is readily transmitted from human to human by [CONTACT_515859] (R0 = 2.5, compared to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic that had an R0 of 1.5; the R0 of seasonal influenza is even lower). The resulting infectious disease has been termed COVID -19. Most infections are mild and similar in 
severity to the common cold. However, about 20 -25% of those with documented infection have more 
sever e symptoms, and approximately 5% of those infected have life -threatening complications ( Figure 
1),
2 including a severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686], pneumonia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], sepsis, delirium, 
cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury, liver injury, and m ulti-organ failure. SARS- CoV-2 belongs to the 
Beta -coronavirus family, which also includes severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] (SARS -
CoV) and Middle East respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] (MERS -CoV).3 Some epi[INVESTIGATOR_515821] 30% and 70% of the world’s adult population could contract SARS- CoV-2 over the coming 
year, although this might be modifiable with appropriate behavioral modification and other measures.
4 There is thus an urgent need to develop and deploy multiple behavioral and pharmacologic 
interventions in order to mitigate the harm of the current SARS -CoV-2 pandemic, as well as to inform 
management of future pandemics. In addition, the disease is likely to spread more easily between individuals living in vulnerable areas w ith condensed living conditions, including many low and middle -
income countries, where large proportions of the population living together in close quarters. The extent of physical distancing that has proved effective in certain countries will not easily b e 
implementable in many lower and middle -income countries, where living conditions are often 
informal, extremely dense and crowded. Furthermore, while suppression of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_515822], it requires a high level of compliance that is unlikely to be maintainable for an extended duration even in economically advantaged countries, and it is economically and socially ruinous. Hence there is urgency to identify effective prophylactic, mitigation, and therapeutic opt ions, as a bridge to the development of an effective vaccine. In response to this 
need, t he COVID -19 Therapeutics Accelerator has been created as a collaborative initiative with 
contributions from an array of public and philanthropic donors, intended to support research and development in order to make effective COVID -19 treatments accessible to the world as quickly and 
as widely as possible. The COVID -19 Research Outcomes Worldwide Network (CROWN) Collaborative 
is a research platform, established with the intention of being one of the organizations to realize the 
vision of the COVID -[ADDRESS_668459] 2021        Page 16 of 46 
  
Figure 1 : The incidence of mild, severe and extremely severe COVID -19. From Guan et al (2020).2 
B. The Extent of the Danger  
SARS- coronavirus -2 is extremely dangerous for several specific reasons,5 including:  
(i) with no prior exposure, people have no immunity and are exquisitely susceptible to 
infection;  
(ii) the virus is easily contracted by [CONTACT_515860] (large and small droplets), and by [CONTACT_515861] (fomites), and then putting a hand to one’s mouth, nose, or eyes;  
(iii) infection spreads at an exponential rate through non -immune communities (R0 = 2.5);  
(iv) the virus can be spread from people who are asymptomatic or who are in the prodromal phase of illness;  
(v) infection is associated with a risk of pneumonia, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], and death in a percentage of people, particularly older adults and those with comorbidities.  
 C. Susceptible Populations  
Some groups within society are especially vulnerable to s evere manifestations of COVID -19. 
Interestingly, unlike some other viral infectious diseases such as measles and influenza, this infection has largely spared children, or if they are becoming infected, symptoms are typi[INVESTIGATOR_14105]. On the other hand, morbid ity and mortality are high in certain demographics, including older men, obese adults, 
those with immunosuppression, and those with various co -morbidities including cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_515823]. In these high- risk groups, mortality from COVID -19 infection is likely to be 
between 10% and 20%, with even higher rates of serious complications. As of 15 November 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reports  53.7 million confirmed cases of COVID -19 associated with 
1.3 million deaths.
6 The rate of new cases and deaths continues to increase  and community 
transmission is entrenched  in many countries .7  
 D.  No Proven Prevention, Mitigation, or Treatment  
Worldwide, non -pharmacological interventions like stay -at-home regulations, travel bans, and 
universal masking policies are used to reduce the reproductive number (R0), but such measures relying 
on socials distancing are not applicable to healthcare workers who have to be in close contact [CONTACT_515862].   Whilst barrier interventions, namely personal protective equipment such 
as respi[INVESTIGATOR_13530], face protection, gowns and gloves are indicated as the minimum standard of prevention for healthcare workers who come into contact [CONTACT_515863] -CoV-2,
8,[ADDRESS_668460] 2021        Page 17 of 46 
 infallible and not always available.  For other populations , barrier interventions such as face masks and 
personal screens are even less available. No p harmacological therapy been proven as effective for 
prevention or mitigation  although remdesivir has been shown in some studies to reduce duration of 
ventilation and dexamethasone reduces mortality in severely ill patients . An ounce of mitigation is 
worth a pound of cure; this is especially true for highly virulent, pathogenic, and prevalent infectious 
diseases like SARS -CoV-2. Several specific vaccines for the SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_668461] shown significant 
protective benefit, however several relevant caveats remain including:  
(i) it will take time  to roll out a COVID -specific vaccine with an established safety profile  
to all at -risk populations ;  
(ii) new strains of the virus might emerge for which the vaccine will not work.  
(iii) the vaccine might confer only brief immunity, since antibodies to SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_668462] to either decrease the incidence of symptomatic COVID -19 or mitigate its average 
severity (duration of illness and complication rates).

 Information on the agents that will be used initially in the CROWN CORONATION trial is provided in 
the supplementary appendices . As this is a platform trial, it is important to emphasize that therapeutic 
arms might be discontinued based on external evidence (from other studies) and internal evidence (generated from this trial). Additional candidate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_515824] o n emerging 
evidence. Decisions to include candidate interventions in the platform trial will be made on the basis 
of a combination of evidence for anti- SARS CoV -[ADDRESS_668463] 2021        Page 18 of 46 
 delivery and adherence considerations, cos t, access and potential to scale up delivery if demonstrated 
to be effective.  
 
The intention is to begin the trial with a 2-arm parallel design, in which participants will be randomized 
to receive the MR or the MMR vaccine (depending on in -country availability), or a placebo injection. 
Subsequent to an initial period of enrolment (estimated at 5,000 participants), a second agent (Drug A) will be added, and the trial will follow a 4-arm 2-by-2 factorial design:  
Arm 1: Education and surveillance plus placebo  
Arm 2: Education and surveillance plus MR (or MMR ) vaccine  
Arm 3: Education and surveillance plus Drug A  
Arm 4: Education and surveillance plus Drug A  + MR (or M/MR) vaccine  
 After another period of enrolment (estimated at 10,000 further participants), a third agent (Drug B) 
will be added, and the trial will follow an 8 -arm 2-by-2-by-2 factorial design:  
Arm 1: Education and surveillance plus placebo  
Arm 2: Education and surveillance plus MR (or MMR ) vaccine  
Arm 3: Education and surveillance plus Drug A  
Arm 4: Education and surveillance plus Drug A  + MR (or MMR) vaccine  
Arm 5: Education and surveillance plus Drug B  
Arm 6: Education and surveillance plus Drug B + MR (or MMR ) vaccine  
Arm 7: Education and surveillance plus Drug A  + Drug B  
Arm 8: Education and surveillance plus Drug A  + Drug B + MR (or MMR ) vaccine  
 E. Protection  
All those who participate in the trial will benefit not only from possible effective prophylaxis and 
mitigation, but also from heightened awareness, education, and screening . If interventions used in 
this trial are effective at preventing or mitigating the severity of COVID -19, participants  might be less 
likely to contract SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_668464] notably, it is designed to address a clinically highly 
relevant question with great importance to society. The question is whether interventions can be 
used preemptively to prevent th e occurrence of COVID -19 or to mitigate its severity at risk 
populations . As a large, pragmatic trial, conducted across multiple continents, this trial will generate 
precise estimates and generalizable results. Importantly it might provide relevant information for future pandemics as well as the current coronavirus pandemic. There are also important limitations . 
Event rates (incidence of COVID -19) may vary over time and are somewhat uncertain. These might be 
higher than anticipated, which would allow the study to reach a conclusion more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], or lower than estimated, which would make this trial too small to detect a difference attributable to the interventions . We plan to increase enrolment at sites where COVID- [ADDRESS_668465] and then deploy practical, affordable and effective proph ylactic and 
therapeutic interventions, as well as those that mitigate the severity of COVID -19. In line with this 
priority, the CROWN (COVID -19 Research Outcomes Worldwide Network) COLLABORATIVE is a 
research platform, established to assess rigorously and efficiently promising interventions for COVID -
19. The CROWN CORONATION trial is designed as a platform trial, such that interventions or 
combinations of interventions  can be added as an arm or arms, if recommended by [CONTACT_515864]. Interventio ns that will be tested in this platform trial will be selected based on 
certain criteria including affordability, safety, accessibility, and scalability, particularly within low - and 
middle -income  countries  (LMIC) .   However, there is no guarantee that par ticipants will be able to 
access any of the interventions tested post trial.  
 I. Conclusions  
Over the next year, the number of people who have been infected by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV-[ADDRESS_668466] with participants (e.g. the point of dispensing I nvestigational Medicinal Product (IMP)  
or placebo, or at any point where investigators are required to take part in samples collection, appropriate PPE will be used by [CONTACT_473]).

 4 Objectives  
 
Primary objective:  
To determine the effectiveness of the active arm(s) in preventing symptomatic (i.e. any of the 
following: cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, new 
loss of taste or smell, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea), laboratory test -confirmed  COVID -19 in 
participants  with repeated exposures to SARS -CoV-2 by [CONTACT_4475] 60 after receiving trial intervention s. 
 
Secondary objectives:  
1. To determine the effectiveness of the trial interventions(s) in preventing symptomatic (i.e. any of the following: cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea), 
laboratory test -confirmed COVID -19 in adults with repeated exposures to SARS -CoV-2 by 
[CONTACT_4475] 150 after receiving trial interventions.  
 
2. To determine the effectiveness of the treatment arm(s) in mitigating the severity of 
COVID -19 in participants  who become infected with SARS -CoV-2 by [CONTACT_4475] 60 after 
commencement of trial intervention. Severity will be graded on a simplified Ordinal WHO 
COVID -19 severity scale. 
 
3. To determine the effectiveness of the trial interventions in mitigating the severity of 
COV ID-19 in adults who become infected with SARS -CoV-2 by [CONTACT_4475] 150 after receiving 
trial interventions. Severity will be graded on a simplified version of the ordinal WHO 
COVID -19 severity scale.

5. To determine the effectiveness of the trial interventions in preventing/reducing the 
incidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection (by [CONTACT_44898]) over up to 150 days ( 5 months ) of follow -
up (see trial duration per participant below).  
5 Trial design  
5.1 Overall design  
 
Study  Design  
CROWN CORONATION is a large, Bayesian adaptive, pragmatic, participant -level randomized, multi-
site, international placebo -controlled trial. Randomiz ation will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (<50 and ≥50),site 
and previous vaccination with a SARS -C0V-[ADDRESS_668468] access to the part of the CRF to enable recording of adverse 
events, outcome data and/or severity of COVID -[ADDRESS_668469] month of observatio n will at a minimum be followed- up until symptom resolution and 
at a maximum until 150 days (5 months ) after randomization (whichever comes first ). 
 
The study flow overview is outlined in Figure [ADDRESS_668470] been shown in randomized controlled trials to improve 
adherence to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) treatment and adapted for HIV Pre -Exposure 
Prophylaxis (HIV PrEP) (e.g. two -way SMS with c heck in for those that report symptoms or adverse 
events).

Sites  
CROWN CORONATION is an international, multi- site trial with sites in Canada, Ghana, India , Ireland, 
South Africa, [LOCATION_006], [LOCATION_003], Zambia and Zimbabwe. Sites will be selected in settings such as community -
based clinics, general practice facilities and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_515825]/REC approval is in  place that the study 
can be conducted there. Access to laborat ory testing and a research pharmacy are required. The 
research site will be associated with a healthcare facility or organization whose staff are considered to 
be at high risk of contracting COVID -[ADDRESS_668473] 2021        Page 24 of 46 
 Participants  
Participants will include adult s (18 years or older) who are at risk for contracting SARS -CoV-2 based on 
their work in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_515826]. See the country -specific addenda for country -specific 
definitions of individuals at risk for SARS CoV -2 exposure.    
 
The reason that participants  are at risk will be recorded in the CRF. Participants will be enro lled in low, 
middle, and high -income countries, including, Canada, Ghana, India,  Ireland, South Africa, [LOCATION_006], [LOCATION_003], 
Zambia and Zimbabwe. Other countries may be added with time. All participants will be fully informed 
about the trial and will provide  informed consent (electronically).   
 
Baseline Data  
At the time of enrolment, demographic information will be collected from participants, and relevant data on their medical histories, comorbidities, concurrent medication,  and risk factors for severe 
COVID -[ADDRESS_668474] in case they become 
unwell so that we can establish what happened to them. This will all be done in line with local data protection legislation.  
 Interventions  
As this is a pragmatic trial, other than administration of the intervention , all decisions regarding other 
measures taken to prevent SARS -CoV-2 infection or to mitigate its severity (e.g. use of personal 
protective equipment, limiting high risk exposures) will be at the discreti on of the participant . 
Educational material regarding both social and clinical practice that could prevent or delay infection will be provided alongside trial information. The trial will track participants at a minimum of weekly for symptoms of infection and compliance with drug self -administration, and should participants 
contract SARS -CoV-2, we would offer them the option of participating in a treatment trial if it is 
available.   
6 Investigational Medicinal Products (IMP s) and Non -Investigational 
Medicinal Products  
6.1      Name [CONTACT_515897](s)  
 
Specific details regarding the IMP (s) used in each country is elaborated in the appendices. New dosage -
based arm(s) or drugs might be added or removed  following review and approval by [CONTACT_515866] . Each label for an IMP (active drug or placebo) will include the description of the 
study product and the information of the source (manufacturer/supplier, batch/lot number and expi[INVESTIGATOR_515827]).  
 Placebo will be aligned to the active IMP in terms of dosing schedule . The interventions will be 
continued for (up to) 60 days from enrolment; or until  the participant is diagnosed with COVID -19; or 
development of a complication or safety concern or side effect necessitating stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_52399] ; 
or the intervention arm is stopped; or participants are no longer at risk of contact [CONTACT_515863] -CoV-2 
infected patients (e.g. no longer new COVID -19 cases at the particip ating site). Treatment groups may 
be discontinued at interim analyses, and new treatment groups might be initiated. If a treatment group is discontinued due to perceived harm, participants in that group will be informed as soon as possible to stop taking the IMP.  
Core -CROWN CORONATION Protocol V8.0, dated [ADDRESS_668475] 2021        Page 25 of 46 
 6.2 Source of IMP (s), Manufacture, Distribution and Storage  
The IMPs (see appendices) will be manufactured and QP released for use in the study by [CONTACT_515867] (IMP) license (or international equivalent). Sourcing of the IMP(s) is also discussed in the 
relevant site -specific IMP management plans.  
6.3 Storage and handling of IMP(s) at site  
 All IMP aspects of the trial at participating sites are the responsibility of the site PI, who may delegate this duty to the local pharmacist or other appropriately trained personnel.  The delegation of duties must be recorded on the Staff Signature [CONTACT_515898]. Storage and handling (e.g., reconstitution, labeling) of the IMP will be completed in accordance with the relevant  summary of 
produ ct characteristics ( SPC) and local IMP management plan. Treatment allocation will be sent to the 
pharmacist preparing the intervention at the point of randomization. The site pharmacist(s) will be unblinded to the treatment arm, they will dispense IMP(s) o r placebo(s) in accordance with the 
treatment allocation and dosing regimen. Final presentation of the IMP or placebo will ensure participants are not aware of the treatment allocation. Detailed instructions are contained in the local IMP management plan.  
6.4 Accountability of IMP(s)  
 IMP shippi[INVESTIGATOR_515828]. In each country, standardized procedures for monitoring of temperature and transport conditions of the IMP will apply and will be documented on the IMP shippi[INVESTIGATOR_515829].  
 Upon receipt of the IMP, the site pharmacy will confirm receipt of the IMPs by [CONTACT_515868][INVESTIGATOR_515830]’s file. In 
cases where the IMP was damaged or not stored correctly this will warrant an urgent notification to the supplier and a replacement will be arranged. The supplier will be responsible for dispatching 
replacement IMPs to sites.  Site ph armacy will be responsible for logging receipt of the IMPs on the 
site accountability log within the site pharmacy file. Site pharmacy will be responsible for storing the IMP in line with storage requirements as per the local IMP management plan. Site phar macy will 
monitor temperature of IMP storage and report to the sponsor any temperature excursions that have occurred. Details of reporting temperature excursion are in the IMP management plan or country specific SOP for IMP Management. Full IMP accountability will be conducted during the trial. All IMP dispensed by [CONTACT_515869]. In 
case of delay in drugs reaching the participants, it is important that the drug should have stability data  
supplied by [CONTACT_515870] 4 months and ideally longer than this.  
 
IMP administration will be specific to the intervention  and is detailed in the relevant appendix. 
Additionally, where relevant, participants will be re minded to adhere during the weekly SMS 
messaging. In vaccine arms, the IMP or placebo will be administered as a single dose by [CONTACT_3462], making proper use of PPE.  
 All used/unused IMPs will be reconciled with site pharmacy, to be then updated in the IMP 
accountability log in the pharmacy site file. IMP destruction or disposal will be conducted, once 
authorized by [CONTACT_515871], and  this will be documented in the 
IMP destruction log in the site pharmacy file.

purposes.  
4. Participants who are willing and able to provide informed consent via an electronic consent 
process. 
 
7.1.2 Trial participant exclusion criteria  
Exclusion criteria (these could be modified depending on the choice of interventions in the platform trial)  
1. Weight outside range 50 kg – 120 kg (110 lbs – 265 lbs).  
2. Prior enrolment into this or other COVID -19 interventional prevention or treatment trials 
(observational trials not excluded).

9. Inability or unwillingness to be followed up for the trial period . 
Additional to the set of exclusions in the core protocol, each arm of the trial (e.g. “MR vs Placebo” arm or “ MMR  vs Placebo” arm) will have their own set of additional exclusion criteria ( refer to the 
appendix). Participants will only be randomized to those arms for which they are eligible.  
7.2 Recruitment  
 Each region will adopt an approach that is appropriate for enrolment according to local conditions, and one that is in compliance with its  IRB/REC and national regulatory body guidelines. Recruitment 
may include advertisements (via posters, emails  and social media messages at each site) that will alert 
relevant potential at risk participants  to the study. Participants will self-identify and self-enrol by 
[CONTACT_515872] (PIS) and then offering electronic informed consent through an online website using computer or smartphone. Participants will be asked to confirm their eligibility, i.e. that they meet all the inclusi on criteria and that they do not meet any of the exclusion criteria. 
Formal verification based on participant responses will be needed by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_515832].                         
Participant recruitment at a site will only commence when the trial has:  
• Been initiated by [CONTACT_1034] (or the delegated representative), and  
• Issued with the ‘Open to Recruitment’ letter.  
Core -CROWN CORONATION Protocol V8.0, dated [ADDRESS_668477] 2021        Page 27 of 46 
 7.3 Informed consent procedure  
Informed consent procedures will be implemented in accordance with local IRB/IEC  and national 
regulatory  authority requirements. The participant must sign the approved version of the informed 
consent form online before any study specific procedures are per formed. See country -specific 
addenda for further details on site -specific procedures and documents.  
 
The online participant information will be presented and will detail the exact nature of the study, what it will involve for the participant, the implicat ions and constraints of the protocol, the known side 
effects and risks involved in taking part. Additional consent may be sought for long -term sample 
storage in selected jurisdictions. This will be detailed in the country -specific addenda. All the site -
specific participant information sheets (PIS) describe the safety issues associated with interventions as 
described in the relevant package inserts. It will be clearly stated that the participant is free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason w ithout prejudice to future care and with no 
obligation to give the reason for withdrawal.  
 For this trial, all consent will be obtained electronically after the participant has read the information. Given the urgency of the clinical question, the pressure  under which staff members are working and 
the simplicity of the trial design, if a participant  wishes to enrol online after reading the PIS, this will 
be permitted, unless specifically excluded in an individual country specific appendix, with the site PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_515833]. The participant 
will be given as much time as wished to consider the information, and to question the PI [INVESTIGATOR_515834]. The consent process may be modified as required to meet local regulatory requirements.  
 The participant will confirm they have read the PIS via the consent form. It will be clearly stated that participants are under no obligation to enter the trial and that they can withdraw at any time during the trial, without having to give a reason. They will be asked for consent to access their medical records for study purp oses should they become ill. No clinical trial procedures will be conducted prior to the 
participant giving consent by [CONTACT_515873]. Consent will not denote enrolment into trial. The PIS and consent form will be reviewed and updated if necessary, throughout the trial (e.g. where new safety information becomes available) and participants will be re -consented as 
appropriate.  
8 Trial procedures  
 
Given the infectious nature of COVID -19, the traditional approach to trials will be adapted to data 
collection through telephone interviews  or self -data collection. For this reason, we aim to ensure that 
all participant -reported data are collected through a combination of an online system and SMS 
messaging. See appendix 1 for the trial schedule of evaluations.  
8.1 Screening / Pre -Enrolment Assessments  
 
The following pre -enro lment assessments  and procedures  will be performed:  
● The participant will be invited to view the trial website.  
● Potential p articipants will be shown the participant information online and asked to complete a 
simple e -questionnaire to ensure that they understand the nature of the trial.  
● If potential participants wish to speak to a member of the study team before giving consent, a mechanism will be offered for them to do so.  
● Participants will be invited to offer consent online.  
Core -CROWN CORONATION Protocol V8.0, dated [ADDRESS_668478] 2021        Page 28 of 46 
 ● They will be asked screening and el igibility questions. Eligibility will be confirmed by [CONTACT_515874] . 
● Participants will also confirm that they expect to continue to have a mobile phone and will have 
access to the Internet for the duration of the trial directly or indirectly (i.e. via local center in remote settings).  
● Participants will be asked for details of at least one alternative contact [CONTACT_515875] u nable to respond to the study team. This will allow the study team to find out what has 
happened  
● If required by [CONTACT_515876], the alternative contact [CONTACT_515877].  
● Site lead will confirm that the participant meets eligibility criteria through the online platform.  
● A new case record will be created on the secure online platform. Basic demographic information and details of past medical history, concomitant medications, allergies, smoking, alcohol and other 
drug intake will be noted.  
● Baseline samples will be collected for batched SARS CoV2 serology testing.  
● Screening failures (i.e. participants who do not meet eligibility criteria at time of screening) will be 
allowed to be  rescreen ed once .  
 
See country -specific addenda  for details  on alternate contacts.  
8.2 Enrolment / Randomization Procedures  
Participant registration will be undertaken online using computer or smartphone.  
Following participant consent, and confirmation of eligibility (see section 8.1 for pre -treatment 
assessments) the registration and randomization procedure described below wi ll be carried out.  
 
Coordinated on -line registration and allocation of participant trial numbers will be required to enrol 
participants. Blocked randomization list will be used to allocate study participants to one of the groups, stratified by [CONTACT_654] , study location. The list s will be created by [CONTACT_515878], supplied by [CONTACT_515879].   
 Participants will be assigned to treatment groups through consecutive allocation of subject numbers, 
and the use of a Trial Subject Enrolment Log which will be stored on the Sealed Envelope system. 
Participants will only be randomized to arms that they are eligible for (refer to section 7.1 and relevant appendix ).   
 Particip ants are considered to be enro lled into the trial following: consent, pre -treatment assessments 
(see section 8.1) including confirmation of eligibility, completion of the registration/randomization process, allocation of the participant trial number and treatment by [CONTACT_515880]/remote system.  
8.3 Procedure for Allocating Intervention/s  
 The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_515835] a new participant has joined the study. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_515836]. Once e- consent and 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_515837]. The local IMP supplier (usually the facility’s pharmacy 
or a research pharmacy) will be alerted that a new participant has joined the study. IMP will be 
prescribed and pre pared for the participant using a locally agreed standard operating procedure. Once 
the IMP is ready, it will be dispensed to the participant after verifying ID.    
Core -CROWN CORONATION Protocol V8.0, dated [ADDRESS_668479] 2021        Page 29 of 46 
 8.4 Dose Modifications  
 
If an adverse event is recorded (see Section 9) , the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_89786] e will be immediately alerted. If 
the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_515838], and if the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_515839], 
the partic ipant may continue to take the IMP, where rel evant . If the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_515840], the participant should do so. No dose reductions or other modifications will be included in the trial.  
8.5 Subsequent Assessments and Procedures  
 All participants will complete online questionnaires of symptoms, general well- being (and compliance 
with drug taking where relevant) at enrolment and then at days [ADDRESS_668480] the 
alternate contacts provided (see section 8.1).   
 If a participant experiences symptoms consistent with COVID -[ADDRESS_668481]. This may be 
collected from their routine health care provider. We plan to evaluate sample integrity under the storage/transport conditions we will be using to collect mid -nasal swab specimens or equivalent 
sample collection.
13,[ADDRESS_668482] 2021        Page 30 of 46 
 See Appendix 1 for schedule of assessments. 
8.6 Laboratory Assessments and Procedures  
 
The primary outcome of the trial is symptomatic (i.e. any of the following: cough, shortness of breath 
or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea) COVID -[ADDRESS_668483]. This will be assessed in 
symptomatic  participants by (self- collected) mid -turbinate nasal swab or equivalent if not otherwise 
collected for local clinical purposes. These have be en shown to have equivalent sensitivity to health 
care worker collected nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs but faster, better tolerated, and with less potential 
for sneezing, coughing and gagging, than an NP swab.15 Depending on local circum stances, at 
enrolment participants may be provided with a pack which includes step -by-step instructions for 
sample self-collection. A swab plus viral transport medium (or saline) will be packaged together for ease of use. Participants will be advised to place the sw ab in the transport medium and to place the 
tube in a transport bag provided.  If a participant prefers not to take their own swab they can seek 
assistance with sample collection at their nearest COVID -19 testing center or to their regular 
healthcare provider. We will describe the methodology and performance characteristics of the quantitative RT -PCR assay(s) used in this study in a laboratory analytical manual. Where feasible, we 
will attempt to quantify viral RNA when viral shedding is assessed in the nasal swab samples collected from participants with SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_668484] these samples for testing later. Details of testing will be specified in the laboratory manuals. Participants will be provided with the necessary equipment and instructions for obtaining dried blood spots (e.g. alcohol swab, lancet, filter paper). Each site will have a procedure for obtaining the dried blood spot specimens from  participants. Sample processing and storage will be completed per site -
specific standard operating procedures. T he DBS might  also to conduct serology for measles and 
rubella antibody titers to evaluate against immunization history and also because there are cases of reported primary vaccination failure .  
 Additional sampling and testing procedures will be detailed in country -specific addenda.

8.8 Assessment of IMP compliance  
 Adherence (where applicable)  will be assessed at each monthly questionnaire along with weekly SMS 
prompts.  
8.9 Disconti nuation / withdrawal of participants  
 In consenting to participate in the trial, participants are consenting to trial treatment, assessments, follow -up and data collection. The importance of safety follow -up will be emphasized to the participant 
in the PIS. Each participant has the right to withdraw from the study at any time. If a participant 
Core -CROWN CORONATION Protocol V8.0, dated [ADDRESS_668486].  
 The decision of the participant to withdraw from treatment will be recorded in the CRF /online 
database . The participant may withhold their reason for withdrawal however, if the participant gives 
a reason for their withdrawal, this will be recorded in the CRF/online database. If a participant explicitly 
states they do not wish to contribute further data to the trial their decision will be respected and 
recorded in the CRF/online database. Trial data already collected will not be  deleted.  
 
Additionally, a participant may be withdrawn from trial treatment whenever the site lead investigator  
considers it necessary. Reasons for discontinuing IMP may include:  
● if the safety risk in an arm warrants discontinuation of all participants in that arm in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] D ata Monitoring Committee (DMC); 
● if the participant develops confirmed symptomatic COVID -19 they will stop the trial 
intervention  where applicable ; 
● unacceptable toxicity; either self -reported on based on assessment by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_515841];  
● intercurrent illness which prevents further IMP administration;  
● participants withdrawing consent to further trial treatment;  
● any alterations in the participant’s condition which justifies the discontinuation of IMP in the site investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649];  
● persistent non -compliance to protocol requirements.  
 The decision to discontinue IMP , where applicable,  must be recorded in the electronic CRF . For 
participants who remain in  the trial for the purposes of follow -up for safety and  / or data analysis , they 
will be managed  according to the treatment arms to which they have been  originally  randomised . 
Loss to follow -up 
If a participant moves from the area  where they started the study, every effort will be made for the 
participant to be followed up at another participating trial site and for this new site to take over the responsibility for the participant. If a participant is lost to follow -up at a site, efforts  will be made to 
contac t the participant’s alternate contact [CONTACT_515881], healthcare or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30469] (if 
the participant has given consent), to obtain information on the participant’s status.
 
8.10 Replacements  
 Withdrawn participants will not be replaced.  
8.11 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_515842]:  
● On the recommendation of the DMC (see section 13).  
● On the recommendation of the sponsors and CI.  
 
If a safety trigger is reached safety data will be reviewed and a decision on continuation will be made 
by [CONTACT_515882].

necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.   
Adverse Reaction (AR)  Any untoward and unintended response in a participant to an 
investigational medicinal product which is related  to any dose 
administered to that participant.  
This includes medication errors, uses outside of protocol (including 
misuse and abuse of product) . 
Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE), Serious Adverse 
Reaction (SAR) or Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  Any adverse event, adverse reaction or unexpected adverse reaction, 
respectively,  that:  
● results in death,  
● is life -threatening*,  
● requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]**,  
● results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or  
● consists of a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
* A life - threatening  event, this refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  
** Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_417041] -patient admission, regardless of length of stay. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing conditions, including elective procedures do not constitute an 
SAE.  
Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse 
Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  An unexpected adverse reaction which is also categorized as serio us. 
Important Medical 
Event  These events may jeopardize the participant or may require an 
intervention to prevent one of the above characteristics/consequences. Such events should also be considered 
‘serious’.  
  In addition to the definition above, Adverse Events (AEs) include but are not limited to the following:  
Core -CROWN CORONATION Protocol V8.0, dated [ADDRESS_668488] 2021        Page 33 of 46 
 ● an exacerbation (i.e. increase in the frequency or intensity) of a pre -existing illness, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_515843] (initially observed at the screening), that is detected after IMP  
administration/ trial intervention  
● Occurrence of a new illness, epi[INVESTIGATOR_515843], that is detected after IMP 
administration/trial int ervention  
 AEs do NOT include:  
● Medical or surgical procedures: the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE  
● Pre-existing disease or a condition present before treatment that does not worsen  
● Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_515844] e.g. elective cosmetic surgery  
● Overdose of medication without signs or symptoms  
9.2 Procedures for recording  and reporting of adverse events (AEs) and 
serious adverse events (SAEs)  
 Non -serious AEs as well as SAEs will be self- reported by [CONTACT_515883]. Participants are requested to provide details of any symptoms they have experienced and details of any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. The investigator will be notified by [CONTACT_515884]-reported by [CONTACT_515885] 
‘Investigator Adverse Event Report. If t he participant becomes very unwell, they will not be able to 
respond to the weekly SMS messages. As long as they have given consent for an alternative contact [CONTACT_515886] (in line with local data protection requirements), the alternate contacts will be  contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
If the alternative contact [CONTACT_515887], or if they cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_189036]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_515845], assess the event and complete an AE form, called ‘Investigator Adverse Event Report’ on the online system, immediately and no later than within [ADDRESS_668489] the participant for further information.  If 
the event is classified as ‘serious’ then additional information may be requested to be completed by [CONTACT_515888].  
9.3.2  Severity assessment  
The investigator will assess all SAEs for severity. Where possible the system used by [CONTACT_3989] (Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) v5.0 27 -Nov-2017 should be used for event name [CONTACT_515899]:

 9.4 Notifications  
The site Investigator or designee will receive an automated notification of the AE when it is initially 
self- reported by [CONTACT_2299]. The investigator (or delegated medically trained person ) must 
complete the causality and seriousness assessment. CCTU will receive notifications of all SAEs.  
Automated reminders will be sent to participant or investigator if safety event forms are not completed in the expected timelines.  The site investigato r will be notified of AEs via the electronic 
system, occurring from the time of randomization until 150 days after randomization . The Clinical 
Reviewer ( medically qualified staff delegated by [CONTACT_3211]) will review all SAE reports received. In the 
event of d isagreement between the causality assessment given by [CONTACT_093] (or delegated 
medically trained person) and the Clinical Reviewer, both opi[INVESTIGATOR_515847]. The Clinical Reviewer will review the ass essment of expectedness 
based on possible wider knowledge of the reference material for the treatment. Country leads are responsible for the reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs to principal investigators and for ensuring reporting to relevant IRB/REC and national regulatory authorities as appropriate. Fatal and life threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs must be 
reported to the regulatory  authorities within 7 days of becoming aware of the event; other S[LOCATION_003]Rs 
must be reported within [ADDRESS_668494] if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a treating physician a participant’s health is compromised.   The 
authorized individual will break the code and immediately inform the treating healthcare professional of the participant’s treatment allocation. The treating physician has the ultimate decision and right to 
unblind the participant.  
 
The code breaks for the trial are held on the online system and are the responsibility of the loc al site 
PI. The local site PI [INVESTIGATOR_515848]. If 
the person requiring the unblinded information is a member of the Investigating team then a request to the authorized individual to unblind will  be made and the treatment allocation information 
obtained.  
 
On receipt of the treatment allocation details the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_515849]’s medical emergency as appropriate. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_515850]. It will also be documented at the end of the trial in any final trial report and/or statistical report.  
 The Investigating team will notify the CCTU in writing as soon as possible following the code break detailing the necessity of the code break.  
9.4.[ADDRESS_668495] 2021        Page 36 of 46 
 provide the unblinded S[LOCATION_003]R information to the relevant regulatory  agencies. S[LOCATION_003]R reports will be 
disseminated to Investigators at site(s) and will remain blinded. The unblinded information will not be 
forwarded to the trial team and will be kept in a separated file with limited access.  
9.5 Development Safety Update Reports  
 The sponsor will provide the main IRB/REC  and relevant national drug regulatory agencies with 
Development Safety Update Reports (DSUR). The report will be submitted within 60 days of the Developmental International Birth Date (DIBD) of the trial each year until the trial is declared ended.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_668496] ose  
 IMP adherence and SAEs will be self -reported. In the event of an SAE associated with an overdose, the 
site, national and coordinating PIs and sponsor will be informed. Incidents will be recorded on the deviation log.   
9.7 Reporting Urgent Safety Measures and other safety events  
 If any urgent protocol deviations for safety measures are taken the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_515851] 3 days from the date the measures are taken, give written notice to the national PI [INVESTIGATOR_38107] w ho will inform the relevant IRB/REC  and national medicines regulatory authority of 
the measures taken and the circumstances giving rise to those measures. Data Coordinating Centre 
(DCC)  or global CRO (PRA) will provide a report on all SAEs for submission to all national IRB/RECs and 
relevant national drug regulatory authorities in accordance with local requirements.   
 
9.8 Notification of Serious Breaches to GCP and/or the protocol  
  A “serious breach” is a breach which is likely to affect to a significant degr ee – 
(a) the safety or physical or mental integrity of the participants of the trial; or  
(b) the scientific value of the trial.  
The sponsor of a clinical trial shall notify the licensing authority in writing of any serious breach of:  
(a) the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with that trial; or (b) the protocol relating to that 
trial, as amended from time to time, within [ADDRESS_668497] access to 
participants’ names and contact [CONTACT_515889], consent and in the event of an SAR or other medically important event. Participant contact [CONTACT_8972] (mobile phone number) will be 
shared with the SMS service to enable data collection.  This will be clearly explained to the participant 
in the Participant Information Sheet.  Participant consent for this will be sought.  
Core -CROWN CORONATION Protocol V8.0, dated [ADDRESS_668498] 2021        Page 37 of 46 
 10.2 Data collection tools and source document identification  
 
Data will be collected using SMS messaging in combination with a trial specific electronic CRF (eCRF), 
directly entered by [CONTACT_515890]. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for completing the e- CRF will be implemented prior to the start of the trial. Text messages, push 
notifications and e -mail reminders will be used to maximize completeness of data. A system will be 
included to enable users to recover lost login IDs and passwords. Data will be entered into the eCRF by 
[CONTACT_515890]. The site investigator will be responsible for confirming the data in 
the CRF prior to data lock . Investigators may enter on behalf of the participants without internet 
access , where assistance is required  or fo r those that become too unwell to respond . The eCRF system 
will audit when this has taken place and it should be documented by [CONTACT_3725].  The delegation log will 
identify all those personnel with responsibilities for data collection and handling, including those who have access to the trial database.  
 
The source data will be the eCRF with the exception of when participants are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_515852].
 
10.3 Data handling and analysis  
 The data for the CROWN CORONATION tria l will be owned jointly by [CONTACT_515891]. The Data Coordinating Centre (DCC) will be at University College London (UCL). The DCC will take responsibility for governance in relation to the data. Data will be de -identified and mir rored in a data 
warehouse curated by [CONTACT_515892]. A global CRO (PRA) will assist with data chases and querying. Pseudonymised data will be provided to them by [CONTACT_515893].  
 A trial specific data management SOP will be in place for the trial. This will contain details of the software to be used for the database, the process of database design, data entry, data quality checks, data queries, data security and database lock.  
 UCL will be responsible for data analysis for the whole study. Direct access will be granted to authorized representatives of University College London and any host institution for monitoring and/or audit of the study to ensure compliance with regulations. Each participating site will have the righ t to request 
access to its own data. Access to unblinded data (by [CONTACT_171794]) will not be granted until the trial is unblinded. The trial’s three coordinating principal investigators (Avidan, Moonesinghe and Rees) will arbitrate disputes regarding requests for data access.  
 Where data are transferred electronically this will be in accordance with the [LOCATION_006] Data Protection Act [ADDRESS_668499] for the recovery of original information after transfer. Appropriate measures will be taken to ensure non- disclosure of information that is potentially harmful to participants. All 
data will be stored in the [LOCATION_006] or the EU. Only non -identifiable data will be transferred outside the EU in 
line with GDPR regulations.  
11 Statistical Considerations  
11.1 Outcomes  
11.1.1  Primary outcome  
Symptomatic COVID -19: Clinical diagnosis of COVID -19 with laboratory confirmation (i.e. based on viral 
PCR), and symptoms of COVID -19 (cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, 
Core -CROWN CORONATION Protocol V8.0, dated [ADDRESS_668500] 2021        Page 38 of 46 
 muscle pain, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell, nausea, vomiting, or d iarrhea) by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_668501]: Severity of COVID -19 over the study period  
i)  Uninfected – no clinical or virologic evidence of infection (Score = 0)  
ii)  Ambulatory – no limitation of activities (score=1) or with limitation (Score=2)  
iii)  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] – mild no oxygen (Score=3) or with oxygen (Score=4), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_515853] – 
Score=5 -7*, dead (Score=8) 
*Score 5 is non -invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen; Score 6 is intubation with mechanical 
ventilation; Score  7 is intubation with additional organ support (e.g. vasopressors, renal replacement 
therapy (RRT), extra corporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) . 
These outcome definitions are based on WHO R&D Blueprint consensus definitions for COVID -19. The 
study period refers to the [ADDRESS_668502] of:  
● Primary endpoint, but instead of the [ADDRESS_668503]  30 days 
after receiving trial interventions ; 
● Primary endpoint, but instead of the [ADDRESS_668504] 150 days 
after receiving trial interventions ; 
● Symptomatic COVID -19 (with subsequent virological confirmation) during the 150 -day study 
period ;  
● Incident COVID -19 during the 60 -day study period, which includes asymptomatic infections 
identified by [CONTACT_515894]-point  of study exit.

Safety Outcomes  
Safety outcomes will be determined according to the CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events) v5.0 27 -Nov-2017 for grading severity of adult adverse events.  
 
Implementation and Process Outcomes  
In addition to monthly confirmation of treatment adherence, where appropriate, we will ask participants to self-report on their compliance with the assigned regimen at the time they exit the trial, or at the time they develop the primary outcome. At the sa me time point we will ask participants to 
self- report on whether they used open label treatments that are used in the active arms of the trial 
(outside of the trial protocol) during the trial.  
11.2 Sample size and recruitment  
11.2.1  Sample size calculation  
We conside red different event rates, depending on the following assumptions. Firstly, we assume d 
that 30 -50% of the participants may become infected with SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_668507] -confirmed symptomatic COVID -19 (i.e. any of the following: cough, shortness of breath 
or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea) is uncer tain. We use a range of 15 -50%. The estimated event rate is therefore 
0.15 * 0.30 = 0.045 (or 4.5%, rounded to 5%) to 0.50*0.50 = 0.25.  
 
We declare the superiority of a treatment arm if the probability that the Odds Ratio (OR) of the 
treatment is less or equal to 1 is greater than 95%, i.e. P(OR < 1 ) > 95 %. The remaining Bayesian 
statistical triggers of the adaptive trial are specified in section 11. 5.   
 A 2-arm trial was simulated to assess the required sample size  for the study. The OR was assumed to 
be 0.7. Three event rates for control arm were used: 5%, 10% and 15%. We are interested in the lower end of the 5 -25% range for the control rate since a higher sample size is required when  the event rate  
in the control arm  decreases for a g iven effect size.  
   
Figure [ADDRESS_668508] 2021        Page 40 of 46 
  
 
Figure 5: Sample size estimation for the first phase of the trial (2-arm) 
 
The simulations show that the probability of declaring efficacy depends on the event rate in the 
placebo arm. With 2000 -2500  participants  per arm , even if the event rate is 5% in the control arm, the 
study has >80% chance to declare efficacy.  
 
We propose to retain the option of reaching a maximum of 2,[ADDRESS_668509] phase of the  trial to allow for possible  loss-
to-follow -up (LTFU), withdrawal, protocol deviation, non- adherence and other methodological 
challenges. Further phases may be added to the trial until a maximum of 30,[ADDRESS_668510] phase of the study are estimated to be recruited with in 12 months , 
depending on the rate of site activation .  
11.3 Randomization methods  
 
Participant -level randomization will be used in the study.  
 
The randomization sequence will be computer generated with permuted blocks. There will be initially equal numbers of participants (1:1) in each of the groups. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (<50 and ≥50)  and site.  
 If the education and surveillance plus placebo arm is discontinued at an interim analysis, participants from this arm will be randomized to the remaining arms.  
Modifications to the number of active treatment arms  
Other arms can be added to CROWN CORONATION if evidence emerges that there are other suitable 
candidate prophylaxis options.  

Core -CROWN CORONATION Protocol V8.0, dated [ADDRESS_668511] 2021        Page 41 of 46 
  
Participants will only be randomized to arm s for which they are eligible. ( e.g. pregnant women will 
not be randomized to the “vaccine vs placebo” arm).  
11.4 Statistical analysis plan  
 
This section provides a general overview of the statistical analysis plan (SAP). A more detailed SAP will be written by [CONTACT_515895] (DMC) 
prior to any substantial analysis of the data.  
11.4.[ADDRESS_668512] deviation (or median and inter -quartile range for non -normally distributed data).  
11.4.2  Primary outcome analysis  
The threshold for declaring that an education and surveillance plus therapeutic agent(s) arm is superior to education and surveillance plus placebo will be based on the OR for the specific arm compared to education and surveillance plus placebo. The object ive is to obtain sufficient certainty ( 95% at least) 
that OR < 1 . In mathematical terms, this quantity is referred to as P(OR < 1 ) > 95 %.   
 
Primary analysis models:  
The primary endpoint of incidence of symptomatic  laboratory -confirmed  COVID -19 infection will be 
analysed using a Bayesian logistic regression, including as covariates the treatment arm, age (<50 vs. 
≥50), and a random effect for site.  
 The prior distribution corresponding to the education and surveillance plus placebo arm  will be such 
that it is centered on 15% for the event rate, midway between the 5%- 25% range that we consider. 
The prior distribution corresponding to the OR of the treatment arm will be such that the OR is  
centered on 1. Further details on the prior distributions are provided in the SAP.  
 
Additiona l multivariable analyses will be conducted, taking into account the following variables: sex, 
smoking, body mass index, HIV infection, pre -existing respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765], diabetes (recent HbA1c), 
hypertension,  and coronary artery disease.  
 
Secondary outcomes:  
 The endpoint of severity of symptoms on the WHO scale will be analysed using a Bayesian proportional 
odds model, using the same adjustment approach as the primary endpoint.  
 
Other secondary outcomes that are binary in nature will be analysed using Bayesian logistic regression, 
using the same adjustment methods as previously described.  
 
In addition, time -to-event models will be used to assess the effect of the interventions on  the time to 
incidence  of symptomatic laboratory -confirmed COVID -[ADDRESS_668513] are: age, HIV 
status, geographic region, ethnicity and sex.  
 
11.5 Interim analyses  
 
This Bayesian trial will perform frequent interim analyses for efficacy, futility and harm. This means 
that the D MC will regularly consider the balance of benefit and risk. Strong evidence of benefit, futility, 
or harm will result in the advice to modify or stop the trial.  
 
The objective of interim analyses is two -fold: 1/ identify wh ether an active arm is futile, if the 
probability that its OR≥0. 9 is high, greater than 95%, 2/ identify whether there is sufficient evidence 
that an active arm is superior to the control arm. The following table contains the statistical triggers 
for efficacy, futility and harm at interim analyses and for the final analysis.  
 
 
Probability  Threshold at interim 
analysis  Threshold  at final 
analysis  Evidence for:  
P0 = P (OR < 1 | data)  99%  95%  Clinical benefit  
P1 = P (OR < 0.8 | 
data)  99%  95%  Marked clinical benefit  
P2 = P (OR ≥ 0.9 | 
data)  99%  95%  Non clinically relevant 
(i.e. futile) treatment 
(or harm when OR ≥ 1) 
 Posterior predictive probabilities will also be calculated at each interim analysis  to inform the potential 
adaptation decisions.  
Platform trial  
In the study there exists a possibility of adding treatment arm(s) at interim analysis or during the course of the study. If a treatment arm is added, all comparisons will be made with concurre nt control 
participants.     
 For the main effects of individual treatments (i.e. when given on their own), the thresholds for superiority and futility described above will apply to the same manner to the additional treatment(s).   
 For treatments that are given in combination in the context of a potential factorial design, the quantity 
of interest will be P (interaction term < 1 | data) ≥ 0. 95% (or 99% at interim analysis) to declare evidence 
of synergy. The prior distribution for the  interaction term will be specified in exactly the same way as 
the prior of the OR of the individual treatments.  Only its interpretation changes.  
 The SAP contains additional details regarding the monitoring of the trial, including the cumulative probability of declaring efficacy depending on  the underlying simulated hazard ratio.  
11.6 Other statistical considerations  
 All randomiz ed participant data will be included in the Intention -To-Treat (ITT) analysis according to 
the arm they were randomi zed to, irrespective of the actual study drug that they took. This ITT analysis 
will be the main strategy for the primary outcome and will be followed by a per protocol analysis . 
Core -CROWN CORONATION Protocol V8.0, dated [ADDRESS_668514] for the trial: Trial Management Group (TMG) and independent  Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). The terms of reference for these committees will 
need to be provided in separate documents.  
13.1 Trial Management Group (TMG)  
The TMG will include the three coordinating Principal Investigators, national principal investigators and k ey trial staff.  The TMG will be responsible for overseeing the trial.  The group will meet regularly 
(monthly) and will send updates to site PIs. The TMG will review recruitment figures, SAEs and substantial amendments to the protocol prior to submission to the IRB/REC and /or relevant national 
drug authority.  All site PIs will be kept informed of substantial amendments through the sponsor or designee and/or national PIs.   
The T MG acts on behalf of the funder(s) and Sponsors .  
13.2 Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  
The role of the DMC is to provide independent advice on data and safety aspects of the trial.  A specific DMC charter will be developed to outline the terms of reference, membership,  and frequency of 
meetings.  The DMC is advisory to the TMG and can  recommend premature closure of the trial.  
[ADDRESS_668515] Access to Source Data/Documents  
The investigator(s)/ institution(s) will permit trial- related monitoring, audits, REC review, and 
regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data/documents.   Trial participants are 
informed of this during the informed consent discussion.  Participants will consent to provide access to their medical notes. Source data for most self-reported data points will be the original entry on to the SMS or electronic CRF system.  
15 Ethics and regulatory requirements  
All international participating sites will obtain approval from the relevant local IRB/REC and  national 
regulatory authorities. The national Principal Investigators and sponsor will ensure that the trial protoco l, PIS, consent form and submitted supporting documents have been approved by [CONTACT_32331] -CROWN CORONATION Protocol V8.0, dated [ADDRESS_668516] 2021        Page 44 of 46 
 appropriate regulatory body and the appropriate research ethics committees responsible for the 
proposed recruitment sites. The protocol, all other supporting documents includ ing and agreed 
amendments, will be documented,  and submitted for ethical and regulatory approval as required. 
Amendments will not be implemented prior to receipt of the required approval(s), except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to  trial participants. The in -country sponsor is 
responsible for obtaining insurance coverage. Details on each specific country are not included in this core protocol.  
16 Monitoring requirement for the trial  
The sponsor will determine the appropriate level and nature of monitoring required for the trial.  Risk will be assessed on an ongoing basis and adjustments made accordingly. The degree of monitoring will be proportionate to the objective, purpose, phase, design, size, complexity, blinding, endpoints,  and 
risks associated with the trial. A trial specific oversight and monitoring plan will be established. The trial will be monitored in accordance with the agreed plan. The research team will monitor the study  
for adverse events. All serious adverse events will be reported to the relevant IRB/REC, according to the local stipulations. The monitoring plan for this study is appropriate for the planned pragmatic trial.  
 The CROWN CORONATION trial will have an appropriate data and safety monitoring plan. There will be a charter to guide the functions of the DMC, and the DMC will produce reports in accordance with relevant guidelines. The DMC will provide independent oversight of the CROWN CORONATION trial and will review the general conduct of the trial as well as study data for participant safety.
 The DMC 
will comprise independent, multidisciplinary experts who will make recommendations regarding the continuation, modification,  or termination of the trial. The members will have the requisite expertise 
to examine accumulating data, to protect the integrity of the clinical experiments in which the 
participants have consented to partake, and to assure the regulatory bodies and the public (and 
possibly funding agencies) that conflicts of interest do not compromise either participant safety or trial integrity. There will be a provision for early stoppage for safety concerns, as well as for efficacy and for futility.  
 
Attempts will be  made to track adherence to the treatment regimens (based on daily or minimum 
twice weekly participant logs from their mobile phone). Questions will also be asked about use of other 
mitigation, including personal protective equipment. Participants  will als o be asked to document the 
frequency of high -risk contacts (e.g., number of patients with COVID -[ADDRESS_668517] with every 
day).  
 
Local investigators at all participating sites will report serious adverse events, or unanticipated 
problems involving risks to participants or others, to their IRB/REC and  to the Trial management group.

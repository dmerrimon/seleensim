1.Introduction 
This document describes the rules and conventions to be used in the presentation and 
analysis of efficacy and safety data for protocol 093-050.  It describes, in detail, the data and endpoints to be summarized and analyzed, including specifics of the 
statistical analyses to be performed .   
This Statistical Analysis and Reporting P lan (SAP) is based on protocol version 6.0, 
dated 7June2013. 
2. Study objectives 
The objective of this study is to confirm the long-term safety and maintenance of 
effect of eslicarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_379736] (flexible dose range of 800  mg to 2400 mg) in 
subjects with partial onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, not well controlled by [CONTACT_379762].   
2.1. Prim ary objective 
To evaluate the 1-Year Open -Label Period  and Post-1- Year Open -Label Period  safety 
and tolerability of eslicarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_379737] [ADDRESS_475288] participated in an 18- week 
double-blind eslicarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_379738] (Protocols 093-045 or 093-046).   
2.2. Secondary objectives  
• To evaluate the maintenance of the therapeutic effects of eslicarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_379739] a 1-Year Open -Label Period  and Post-1- Year Open -Label Period.   
• To evaluate the health -related quality -of-life, suicidality, and depre ssive 
symptoms over a 1- Year Open -Label Period  and Post-1- Year Open -Label Period .   
3. Study design  
3.1. General Description  
This study is a long -term, multicenter, open -label, safety extension study in male and 
female subjects (aged 16 to 70 years, inclusive) with partial onset seizures who have 
just completed, discontinued, or exited the 18-week treatment phase of Protocols 093-[ADDRESS_475289]’s locale, or the sponsor terminates the study drug clinical development program.   
This study will evaluate the safety and maintenance of  effect of long -term 
eslicarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_379740] 800 mg to 2400 mg 
once-a-day (QD) over a 1-Year Open -Label Period  and a Post-1-Year Open -Label 
Period.

Copyright © [ADDRESS_475290]-1- Year Open -Label Period  part of the study will continue 
to receive the same dose of study drug that they received at Visit 7 (end of 1-Year 
Open-Label Period  of treatment) .  The same dosing rules as in the 1- Year Open -Label 
Period part of the study are applicable in the Post-1-Year Open -Label Period  part.  
Subjects with a clinically significant increase in seizure frequency, duration, or severity, who have not responded to or did not tolerate an increase in dose of study drug, may be started on an additional antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_32551] (AED) during both the 1- Year 
Open-Label Period  and Post-1-Year Open -Label Period  parts of the study.  A 
maximum of two additional AEDs to control seizures will be allowed, however oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_92560] .  If, after the addition of the second additional 
AED, the subject experiences  an adverse event, the dose of eslicarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_379741].  In addition, for subjects with a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS), the device setting may be changed as needed.   
Subjects who require doses outside of the [ADDRESS_475291]-1- Year Open -
Label Period  parts of the study will be discontinued from study participation.   
Physicians may p rescribe lorazepam for rescue use.  Diazepam (rectal gel) as an 
emergency medication will be provided by [CONTACT_456] (via prescription from local physician) .  In countries where lorazepam and/or diazepam rectal gel are not available, 
alternate treatments are allowed per Appendices XII and XIII in the protocol.

−Visit Date of  first  visit during  the interval  of interest 
3. Relative change in seizure frequency  from baseline 
Seizure frequency change from the baseline period will be evaluated by [CONTACT_379766] 
4 weeks (28 days).  The baseline period is the period from Visit 1 to Visit 2 from 
Protocols 093-045 or 093-046. The relative (%) change in SSF  for any interval of interest (including baseline) will be 
calculated as:  
(SSF during the interval of interest) –  
      (SSF during baseline period) x 100 
SSF during baseline period 
Further the relative change from baseline will be categorized into: 
 100% Decrease
 ≥ 75%  - < 100% Decrease 
 ≥ 50%  - < 75% Decrease 
 0% to < 50% Decrease

complete each interval of interest  without any seizures to be considered seizure- free 
for each interval of interest. 
The number and percent of seizure- free subjects will be presented for the i nterval of 
interest, for each interval the percent will be based out of the number of subjects in 
the ITT population entering each interval of interest.   
6.Seizure frequency by [CONTACT_379767]  #2 of this 
section. 
7.Completion rates  
Study completion is defined as the proportion of subjects from the ITT population 
who completed the entire 1- Year Open -Label Period (Visit 1 to Visit 7 ). 
8.Treatment retention time (time to withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse 
events) .   
If a subject’s reason  for withdrawal from 1-Year Open -Label Period  included: 
withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, physician decision or other, then it will be 
assumed the subject terminated due to lack of efficacy . For subjects that discontinue 
due to adverse event or lack of efficacy, the t reatment retention time during the 1-
Year Open -Label Period will be calculated as the date of last known dose during the 
1-Year Open -Label Period  minus the date of the first dose of eslicarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_379745] 093-045 or 093-046 ( Visit 6/Week 8) , plus 1.  T he time may 
include taking eslicarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_379746].

5.2.4. Entire Open -Label  Period Endpoints  
1. Change in Quality of Life in Epi[INVESTIGATOR_379750] -31 contains seven multi- item scales that assess the following health 
concepts:  emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, cognitive 
functioning, seizure worry, medication effects, and overall quality of life.  The 
QOLIE-31 overall score  is obtained by [CONTACT_2329] a weighted average of the multi- item 
scale scores .  The QOLIE- 31 also includes a single item that assesses overall health  
on a visual analogue scale.  The recorded responses will be converted to 0 -100 point 
scales as described in Table 1 .   The mean of the individual item scores in each 
subgroup are then calculated, with higher converted scores reflecting better quality of life.  If one item within a scale score is missing, it will be replaced by [CONTACT_379769] .  If more than one item is missing, the scale score will not be 
calculated .   
The QOLIE -31 overall score is obtained by [CONTACT_2329] a weighted average of the 7 scale 
scores according to the following formula: 
Overall score = Seizure  worry * 0.08 
   + Overall quality of life * 0.14 
+ Emotional well-being * 0.15 
   + Energy/fatigue * 0.12 
   + Cognitive functioning * 0.27    + Medication effects * 0.03    + Social functioning * 0.[ADDRESS_475309] -treatment 
assessment in QOLIE-31 overall score will also be calculated.

The total score is defined as the sum of all individual item scores .  If one item is 
missing at a  given visit, it will be replaced with the mean of the answers that are 
present.  If more than one item is missing at a given visit, no total score will be 
calculated .   
Change in MADRS total score will be summarized from Visit 2 (Day 0) of P rotocols 
093-045 or 093-046 (baseline)  to end of study treatment ( ET/EOS). This analysis will 
be repeated for subjects  with a MADRS score of ≥14 at screening visit (Visit 1) of the 
present study.   
5.3. Safety Assessments and Endpoints  
5.3.1. Safety Assessments 
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study, starting at Visit 1 .    
Clinical laboratory tests to be collected include:  serum chemistry, hematology, 
thyroid panel ( free T3, free T4, and TSH), coagulation testing (prothrombin time 
[PT]/international normalized ration [INR] and partial thromboplastin time [PTT]), lipid panel (total cholesterol, high -density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol, low-density 
lipoprotein [LDL]-cholesterol, and triglycerides), bone turnover markers (serum  25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-OHD], parathyroid hormone [PTH], os teocalcin, 
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and urinary N-telopeptides of type I collagen cross-links [NTx]), and urinalysis.

The C-SSRS is an instrument designed to systematically assess and track suicidal 
events (suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation) throughout the study.  The C- SSRS 
includes the following four sections: Suicidal Ideation, Intensity of Ideation , 
Suicidal Behavior and Actual Suicide Attempts.  The C-SSRS will be completed by 
[CONTACT_91564]-Investigator (or qualified site personnel).   
5.3.2. Safety Endpoints  
Adverse Events  
All AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), 
Version 13.1.   
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be defined as:  
• AEs that occurred on or after the first dose of study drug during this protocol,   
• AEs with a missing  start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of study 
drug during this protocol, or  
• AEs with both a missing start and stop date.   
Adverse events whose relationship is assessed as “not related” will be grouped as 
“unrelated.” Otherwise, adverse events assessed as “unlikely,” “possible,” “probable,” or “definite,” unknown or missing will be grouped as “potentially related.” Further, if a subject reports more than one AE within the same treatment regimen, system organ class (SOC) and preferred term  (PT), and any are related, it will be summarized as 
related.   
If a subject has more than one occurrence of an event within a SOC and/or PT, the subject incidence summaries will count each subject only once within that SOC and/or PT.  In the case of more than one event within a SOC and/or PT, the event with the 
highest severity will be summarized in the by -severity summaries and the one with the 
strongest relationship will be summarized in the by- relationship summaries.  
TEAEs will be sorted by [CONTACT_379771], with preferred terms with the same frequency sorted in alphabetical order.  
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation    
Observed values and change from baseline will be summarized  for each visit, where 
change from baseline is the result of interest minus baseline value (Visit 2/Day 0 from 
protocol 093-045 or 093-046).  
Each laboratory result will be cross referenced with laboratory-provided normal 
reference ranges to determine whether the test result is below, within, or above the 
normal range.  Similarly, sponsor defined- potentially clinically significant (PCS) 
laboratory results will be identified using the criteria in Table 2.

Graft in the Treatment of Stenosis at the Gr aft-Vein Anastomosis of AV Graft Circuits 
Sponsor: Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc. 
[ADDRESS_1164973] Tempe, AZ [ZIP_CODE] 
Objective: The objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the C OVERATM 
Vascular Covered Stent for the treatment of stenotic lesions at the graft-vein anastomosis of hemodialysis patients dialyzing with a synthetic AV graft. 
Design & Overview: This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm clinical study designed 
to assess the safety and effectiveness of the C OVERATM Vascular Covered Stent for the 
treatment of stenotic lesions at the graft-vein anastomosis of hemodialysis subjects 
with a synthetic AV graft. Safety and effectiveness measures of subjects receiving the 
COVERATM Vascular Covered Stent will be compared to Performance Goals (PG) 
derived from the results reported in clini cal literature as well as those of other 
prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_838648]-market studies. 
Follow-up for all treated subjects will be performed at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], [ADDRESS_1164974]-index procedure.  
Study Device: The C OVERATM Vascular Covered Stent is a highly flexible self-expanding 
endoprosthesis comprised of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) encapsulating 
a nitinol (nickel-titanium alloy) stent framework. The inner lumen of the stent graft 
(blood contact[CONTACT_838650]) is carbon impregnated. 
The C OVERATM Vascular Covered Stent is availa ble in a straight and a flared 
configuration. Devices will come on either an 8F or 9F system.

2  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
2.1 Overview of Study Design 
The clinical study will be a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm study 
with the primary objective to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of the C OVERATM 
Vascular Covered Stent for trea tment of lesions at the graft-vein anastomosis of patient’s 
dialyzing with synthetic AV grafts.  
2.2 Analysis populations 
The analysis populations will be defined as follows for this study: 
 The ITT population will consist of all subjects  that have met all eligibility criteria, 
undergone successful PTA of the targ et lesion, and into which the C OVERATM 
Vascular Covered Stent System is introduc ed (i.e. the delivery system enters the 
subject’s body). 
Subjects who do not receive the study device, but into which the C OVERATM Vascular 
Covered Stent System was introduced, will be included in the ITT population.  
Subjects who require additional treatment modalities will be included in the ITT population. 
 The Modified ITT (MITT) population will consist of any subjects in the ITT 
population who are tr eated with the C
OVERATM Vascular Covered Stent (following 
PTA). 
 A Per-Protocol (PP) population may be crea ted if there are subjects who have any 
major protocol deviations. The PP population w ill consist of any subjects in the MITT 
population who do not have any major protoc ol deviation. The protocol deviations 
that are considered to have a “major” grade will be defined a prio ri in the analysis 
plan.  
All analyses including the primary analyses will be primarily based on the MITT population. Key safety analysis will be perf ormed based on ITT population as well. PP 
analyses may also be performed for the pr imary endpoints. They will only serve as 
sensitivity analyses for the primary analys es which are based on the MITT population.   
2.3 Assessment of the Poolability of Investigational Sites 
The sites will be tested for potential differences in the primary endpoints.  Sites with fewer than 10 treated subjects may be combined for this purpose.  The sites with less than 
10 subjects will be sorted by [CONTACT_838651](s) with at least [ADDRESS_1164983] is 
<0.15, it will be considered as evidence of st atistical significance.  Additional analyses

will be performed to explore the differences between sites to assess their potential causes 
and whether or not they ar e clinically meaningful. 
2.4 Handling of Missing Data 
Study endpoints may be missing due to withdrawal of consent, Investigator’s decision, LTF and subject death.  It is important to minimize missing data by [CONTACT_564168].  Missing data will be handled as de scribed subsequently. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the primary effectiveness and safety endpoints will also be analyzed using survival analys is techniques.  In survival analyses, unobserved endpoints 
are a standard part of the analysis; they are known as “censored observations”.  As long as the censoring is unrelate d to the treatment, this met hod of handling missing endpoints 
produces unbiased estimates of the free dom-from-event rates.  For both primary 
endpoints, the reason  for the censoring of all subjects with missing endpoints will be 
reported.  If there is any indi cation that the censoring is re lated to the study intervention, 
a worst-case analysis may be performed for each primary endpoint, in addition to the 
standard analysis.  In a worst-case analysis, an  event will be assumed to have occurred at 
the time the subject was censored for all such subjects.  
In addition, regardless  of whether missing data are rela ted to the study intervention, a 
tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-point analysis will also be performed, in which assumptions about missing data 
are varied from worst-case to best-case to examine at what point the missing data would alter the results of the analysis.  
2.5 Sample Size Estimation  
The sample size calculation assumes the following: 
1) Primary Effectiveness Endpoint – TLPP at 6 months performance goal. 
 Assumptions: 
o The C
OVERATM Vascular Covered Stent composite  freedom from event rate is 
estimated at 55%; 
o The PG is set at 40%; 
o Attrition (drop-out) rate  (by 6 months) = 15%; 
o The Type 1 error,   = 0.05 (one-sided); and 
o The Type 2 error,  = 0.10 (Power = 1 -  = 90%). 
 Sample Size: o 109 treated subjects [93 evaluable] will give 90% power with one-sided type I 
error =0.05. 
2) Primary Safety Endpoint – Safety at 30 days:  
 Assumptions: 
o The primary safety rate through 30 days in the study device treated subjects is 
98%; 
o The PG is set at 88%;

o Attrition rate (by [CONTACT_4475] 30) = 5%; and 
o The Type 1 error, α = 0.05 (one-sided). 
 Sample Size: 
o 109 treated subjects [104 evaluable] will give 99% power with one-sided type 
I error =0.05. 
Hence, the sample size of 109 subjects w ill provide approximately (99%)*(90%)=89% 
power for the both primary effectiv eness and primary safety endpoint. 
2.6 Primary Endpoints  
2.6.1 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint 
The primary effectiveness endpoint of the study is an effectiveness measure based on Target Lesion Primary Patency (TLPP) through 6-months post index procedure. 
2.6.[ADDRESS_1164986] 
The primary effectiveness endpoint is TLPP through 6-months.  Objective: To 
assess if the 6 month TLPP for the C OVERATM Vascular Covered Stent is greater 
than the effectiveness PG.   
The primary effectiveness endpoint will be evaluated by [CONTACT_103368]: 
H0: The proportion of subjects in the study device treatment group (P CE) with 
TLPP through [ADDRESS_1164987] index procedure is less than or e qual to that of 
the effectiveness PG of 40%. 
H1: The proportion of subjects in the study device treatment group (P CE) with 
TLPP through [ADDRESS_1164988] index procedure is greater than that of the 
effectiveness PG of 40%. 
That is: 
H0: P CE ≤ 40%,  
H1: P CE > 40%,  
Rejection of the null hypothesis will si gnify that the 6 month TLPP of the 
COVERATM Vascular Covered Stent is greater th an the effectiveness PG of 40%.   
A one sided p-value will be derived base d on an exact binomial test.  The study 
device will be considered to have achieved the primar y effectiveness objective if 
the one-sided p-value is less than 0.05.  Or equivalently, the lower limit of the one-sided 95% confidence limit based on ex act method is greater than 40%.

2.6.[ADDRESS_1164990] 
The primary safety endpoint is safety thr ough 30 days.  Objective:  To assess if the 
30-day primary safety rate for the study device is greater than the safety PG: 
H0: The proportion of subjects in the study device treatment group (P CS) free 
from safety events in the primary safe ty endpoint is less than or equal to 
the safety PG of 88%. 
H1: The proportion of subjects in the study device treatment group (P CS) free 
from safety events in the primary sa fety endpoint is greater that of the 
safety PG of 88%. 
That is: 
H0: P CS ≤ 88%,  
H1: P CS > 88%,  
Rejection of the null hypothe sis will signify that the 30 day safety of the C OVERATM 
Vascular Covered Stent is greater than the safety PG of 88%.   
A one sided p-value will be derived base d on an exact binomial test.  The study 
device will be considered to have achiev ed the primary safety objective if the one-
sided p-value is less than 0.05.  Or equiva lently, the lower lim it of the one-sided 
95% confidence limit based on exact method is greater than 88%.

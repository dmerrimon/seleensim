2.0  Background  Information  
 
2.1  Introduction  and Background   
The recent emergence of  Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_303989] (SARS -CoV-2) in 
Wuhan, China in late [ADDRESS_371857] of the world has created a pandemic 
situation unprecedented in modern history 1-4. SARS -CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus closely related to 
SARS -CoV; however, significant differences in the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_179890] (SGP) are present in SARS -
CoV-[ADDRESS_371858] differences in the attachment and entry process. In SARS -CoV, the SGP binds 
to its cognate receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The bound virus is then 
endocytosed into the cell, where SGP is acted upon by [CONTACT_303997]2 to allow 
envelope fusion and viral entry.  
While ACE2 has been confidently identified as the viral receptor, many viruses (including some 
betacoronaviruses) will use cellular polysaccharides as cellular attachment co receptors, allowing the 
virus to adhere to the surface of the cell and increasing the local concentration of viral particles to 
increase effective infection rates. Sequence analysis of SGP of SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_371859] additiona l potential glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding domains compared to 
SARS -CoV. GAGs are a family of linear sulfated 
polysaccharides found on the surface of virtually all 
mammalian cells, and commonly includes 
chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS). 
Previous studies using isolated SARS -CoV-2 SGP 
monomer or trimer and surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR) have shown that SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_371860] stages. Heparin is an FDA -approved drug commonly 
used via intravenous infusion, intravenous injection or deep subcutaneous injection as  an anti -
coagulant, where it acts in the blood to disrupt the coagulation cascade. Heparin has numerous side 
effects, including bleeding and heparin -induced thrombocytopenia, all of which also occur due to 
heparin activity in the blood. Moreover, heparin i s used in COVID -19 treatment where evidence of 
microclotting (such as high D -dimer levels) is present. Because of this, use of heparin as an anti -viral 
through a route of administration that allows for significant distribution to the blood carries risks, 
especially for projected use outside of a closely -observed clinical setting.  
Figure 1: Model of SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_371861] that COVID -19 treatment by 
[CONTACT_303998]-coagulation treatments while potentially still providing a prophylactic or therapeutic benefit.  
Heparin’s inability to affect blood coagulation when administered intranasally is due to the molecule’s 
large molecular weight which precludes its active and passive transport across the epi[INVESTIGATOR_303990].   Recent published reports indicate that the nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_303991]  a probable major 
portal for initial infection and transmission based on viral loads in both symptomatic and asymptomatic 
patients 10-11, as well as expression patterns of both the hACE2 receptor and the TMPRSS2 protease 
12. This suggests that a self -administered nasal spray of heparin  may be a simple, safe and effective 
prophylactic to lower the rates of SARS -CoV-2 transmission. A previously disclosed patent indicated 
that heparin formulated in 15% ethanol had only 0.02% sy stemic bioavailability 13; this small amount of 
bioavailability is likely due to the presence of the 15% ethanol. S ingle intranasal administration of 
saline heparin  in a rat m odel resulted in no noted toxicity and very poor serum bioavailability 9. We are 
aware of no published studies of repeated dosing of intranasal heparin .

assay for heparin (160 USP/mg) are shown in Figure 2 . 
Heparin showed high potency, with an IC 50 of 5.99 µg/L (95% CI: 2 .90 – 11.96 µg/L), or 0.96 U/L. 
Based on the average molecular weight of heparin of 15,000 g/mol, this equals an IC 50 of ~[ADDRESS_371863] all infection has been stopped. C. 
Dose response curve of heparin for doses from 5 00 mg/L to 5 µg/L. 

[ADDRESS_371864] the toxicity of repeated intranasally administered doses of heparin, we carried out a 
two-week blinded toxicology study in C57BL/6 mice. Mice were administered 12 µL (6 µL/nostril) of a 
heparin sodium saline formulation identical to the FDA -approved formulation used for deep 
subcutaneous injection (5 mg/mL sodium chloride, 1% benzyl alcohol, pH 5.0 – 7.5, adjusted using 
sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid as needed) . Four groups of six mice each, plus one control 
group of six mice, were used to test heparin. Each group was given 12 µL of heparin daily for two 
weeks at concentrations of 5000 mg/L, 500 mg/L, 50 mg/L or 5 mg/L, with the control group given the 
vehicle. Given the average mouse nasal cavity volume of 32 mm3, this results in a peak nasal cavity 
concentration of 1875 mg/L, well above the highest dose tested in the in vitro  pseudotype study. Mice 
were monitored daily for bleeding, nasal discharge, nose irrita tion or discoloration, and weight loss.  
At the end of the two -week study, the samples were unblinded  and the mice exposed to the highest 
dose were tested for anosmia. All mice were euthanized, and a necropsy was performed to identify 
any gross tissue abnormalities. Blood was used to perform an activated partial thromboplastin time 
(aPTT ) test to look for  anticoagulant activity , as well as look for decreases in platelet count to indicate 
heparin -induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) . In no cases were any evidence of toxicity found at any dose 
tested.   
3.0  Study Objective s 
 This exploratory clinical trial is desi gned to assess tolerability  of increasing doses of intranasally 
administered heparin sodium in saline solution . Baseline values for aPTT and complete blood count 
will be obtained from six subjects . Heparin will be administered in increasing concentrations using 
one 0.1 mL spray per nostril  (0.2 ml total)  on a daily basis. Major signs of toxicity will be clinically 
relevant changes in aPTT time, clinically relevant decrease in platel et count, signs of anosmia  30 
minutes after administration, or epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. Dosing will start at 1000 units of heparin  administered  (500 
U in each nostril ) and then  escalated to 2000 units . Signs of toxicity include  a clinically relevant aPTT 
time (> 90s) or decrease in platelet count (below clinical lab normal limit).  Tolerance of each dose 
during the acute phase will be used to determine the dose tested for a 14 -day self -administered 
chronic phase to determine any adverse effects of repeated dosing.  
4.0  Study Overview  
4.1 Description of Design of Study  
This study is a single center, prospective , Phase 0 exploratory tolerability t rial.  A total of 6 healthy 
subjects  (3 M and 3 F)  will be enrolled in to the study. This study will evaluate the acute and multi -day 
(14 days) tolerability of intranasally administered heparin . 
5.[ADDRESS_371865]  
 
The study will assess the single and multi -dose tolerability  of intranasal administration of an aliquot 
of an  FDA-approved heparin sodium injection  (5,000 USP units/mL or 10,000 USP units/m L) to 
deliver 1000U or 2000U of heparin sodium .  Doses will be prepared and administered as follows:  
1000 U = (2 x 0.1 mL of 5000U /mL or one spray of 500 U in each nostril)  
2000 U = (2 x 0.1 mL of 10000U /mL or one spray of 1000 U in each nostril)   
 
In order to minimize the need for formulation stability testing, we are limiting our studies to 
formulations of heparin currently FDA -approved for administration by [CONTACT_17838]. In order to maximize 
patient compliance f or self -administration, we are testing formulations that require only a single 100 
µL spray per nostril. Heparin sodium injection is currently available in concentrations up to 10,000 
units/mL, or 1,000 units/spray. As the formulation is liquid, we decided  that nasal cavity volume was 
the appropriate measure to determine tolerable concentration. Our initial mouse studies found that 
7 
V20 9.1 .2020  doses up to 337.5 U of heparin per cubic centimeter of nasal cavity volume each day were tolerated 
for the entire 14 days of th e study, based on an average mouse nasal cavity volume of 32 mm3 14. In 
humans, this corresponds to a dose of up to  7,155 U/day based on an average human nasal cavity 
volume of 21.[ADDRESS_371866] 
available heparin concentration (2,000 U/day).  
Our pharmacok inetic goal was to maintain a concentration of heparin ≥ 0.267 U/cm3 nasal cavity 
volume for at least eight hours (preferably twelve hours).  In vivo  imaging studies in a mouse model 
indicate that between 1% and 4% of the applied 2.67 U dose remained in the  nasal cavity after 
twelve hours. If this elimination model holds in humans, a 1000 U dose (the lower dose to be 
tested) would results in a concentration between 0.47 and 1.89 U/cm3 nasal cavity volume after 
twelve hours, meeting our pharmacokinetic goal. The next lower concentration of heparin currently 
commercially available (1000 U/mL, or a 200 U dose), would result in a lower range of retained 
concentration below our target concentration after twelve hours (0.094 to 0.378 U/cm3). Both the 
1000 U dose (4 7.2 U heparin per cm3 nasal cavity volume) and the 2000 U dose (94.3 U heparin 
per cm3 nasal cavity volume) are well below our highest tested and tolerated dose in mice of 337.[ADDRESS_371867]  
Heparin Sodium (Injection, USP) is a sterile preparation of heparin sodium derived from porcine 
intestinal mucosa in water for injection as an anticoagulant.  The drug preparation is available in 
various potencies.  Potency is determined by a biological assay using a USP reference standard 
based on units of heparin activity per milligram.

(i.e., aPTT ≤90 seconds) will be used for the multi -day phase of this 
study  
 
2. The test subject will receive one spray of heparin nasal solution into 
each nostril to deliver a total dose of either 1000U, or 2000U daily for 14 
days.  The administered daily dose (and volume) will depend upon 
the results of the acute phase. The highest dose in which aPTT ≤ 90 
seconds is observed will be u sed. (Some subjects may only tolerate 
1000U, while others may easily tolerate 2000U. Still others may not 
tolerate 1000U and will be removed from the study.  See Table 2)  
Subjects will receive the dose at which no clinically relevant 
increase in aPTT (i.e., ≤90 seconds) is observed (see Section 9.0 ) 
 
3. The initial dose (Day 0 ) and last dose (Day 14) will be administered at 
the NCNPR Clinical Studies Facility. All other doses will be self -
administered by [CONTACT_304004].

  medications since last dose  
 
4. Obtain a urine sample for hCG on female Test subjects  
 
5. If the test subject’s aPTT result is [ADDRESS_371889] one of 
the two acute doses (result from 72 hour follow up , section 8.1.5 ), 
administer heparin nasal solution into each nostril to deliver a total dose 
of either 1000U or 2000U, per study RN.  The administered daily  dose 
(and volume) will depend upon the results of the acute phase (i.e. 
dose yielding aPTT ≤90 seconds)  as outlined in 8.2.[ADDRESS_371890] subjects  will report  
 to the Resear ch Clinic at specified date/ time for blood draw and  
 assessments.  
 
[ADDRESS_371891] subjects  will be given a 14 day dose nasal sprayer , along with 
“dosing diary” to record time of administration and number of intranasal 
sprays, during self -administer at home. (instru ctions will be given to each 
Test Subject)

9.[ADDRESS_371895] will be called every three (3) days for updates and subjective reports 
(adverse events).  Subject safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_12902], clinical laboratory  
tests, vital signs, and physical examinations.  
 
Throughout the study l aboratory values will be monitored closely by [CONTACT_304005]. Subjects with an aPTT value of 60 seconds or greater 
(normal range is 30 -40 seconds) will not recieve the initial daily dose (one 0.1 mL spray of heparin nasal 
solution in each nostril to deliver a total dose of 1000U [500U per nostril/0.1mL per nostril to equal total 
dose of 0.2mL]), OR  proceed to dose 2 (o ne 0.1 mL spray of heparin nasal solution in each nostril to 
deliver a total dose of 2000U [1000U/0.1mL per nostril to equal total dose of 0.2mL]) , in the acute phase.  
  
In the multi -day, or chronic phase, each individual test subject’s dose will be based on the highest acute 
dose received that produced no clinically relevant impact on aPTT  (i.e., aPTT ≤ 90 seconds). This 
dose (1000U or 2000U) will be used for the multi -day phase of this study.  
 
 9.1 Vital  Signs 
 Vital signs  (temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressur e, heart rate, SpO2) will 
be collected prior to the initiation of the test article  and with the Safety 
assessment visits at 24, [ADDRESS_371896] study visit , per Study RN & MD.   
 
 
9.3 Laboratory Parameters

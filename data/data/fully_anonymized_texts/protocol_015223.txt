Version Date: 1.3.2020  Title: The effect of etelcalcetide on bone -tissue properties and calcification propensity in end stage 
kidney disease  
Hypotheses:  Our hypothesis is that etelcalcetide treatment improves bone tissue -properties and bone mineral 
density by [CONTACT_602045]. We also hypothesize that etelcalcetide’s ability to lower serum calcium will 
decrease propensity of serum to calcify as determi ned by T50.  
Background and Study Objectives  
Chronic kidney disease – mineral and bone disease (CKD -MBD) is a systemic disorder of bone and mineral 
metabolism in patients with CKD. As kidney function declines, a bnormal vitamin D metabolism and renal 
phosphate handling drive the development of hyperparathyroidism (HPT), hyperphosphatemia, renal 
osteodystrophy and soft tissue calcifications. Clinical outcomes associated with CKD -MBD include bone 
fractures, cardiova scular events and death. Treatment of CKD -MBD is centered around the suppression of 
parathyroid hormone (PTH) by [CONTACT_602046] D (parent and active D) and correction of 
hyperphosphatemia. In patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD), tar get levels of PTH recommended by 
[CONTACT_602047] (KDIGO) guidelines are in the range of 2 -9 times the upper limit 
of normal (ULN) for the PTH assay1. However, in patients with long -standing ESKD, abnormalities may develop 
in the parathyroid gland that both diminish responsiveness to treatment and lead to failure to achieve PTH levels 
within the KDIGO target range. PTH levels greater than the target ra nge increase the risks of bone loss, fractures, 
soft tissue calcification and 
cardiovascular events. In these cases, 
treatment with a calcimimetic, a 
pharmacologic agent that enhances 
sensitivity of the parathyroid glad to 
serum levels of calcium, can rest ore 
PTH levels to goal. Etelcalcetide is a 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approved calcimimetic for the treatment 
of secondary HPT in adult patients with 
CKD on hemodialysis2-4. The proposed 
prospective cohort study will investigate 
the effects of etelcalcetide on the bone 
and vascular calcification components of 
CKD -MBD. We will test if treatment with 
etelcalcetide improves bone properties 
on the tissue level, increases area l bone 
mineral density (BMD) by [CONTACT_11323] X -
ray absorptiometry (DXA), improves 
cortical and trabecular BMD and 
microarchitecture and mechanical 
competence by [CONTACT_602048] (HR -
pQCT), and decreases serum 
propensity to calc ify soft tissues. For all 
Aims,  the enrollment scheme and study 
timeline are described in Figures [ADDRESS_796943] if 6 -months of treatment Figure 1. Study Procedures for All Aims

Version Date: 1.3.[ADDRESS_796944] of care. These 20  patients with ESKD will be treated with 
etelcalcetide to maintain levels of PTH between 30 0 and 400 pg/mL, w hich is at the mid -range of the  KDIGO 
recommended range ([ADDRESS_796945] for the PTH assay1) for 6 months. Patients will be identified for inclusion 
based on clinical need for the treatment of severe HPT and high turnover bone disease and only patients whose 
treating physician plans to initiate etelcalcetide will be included. HPT will be defined by [CONTACT_602050] 
(PTH >[ADDRESS_796946] for the PTH assay1) and high turnover bone disease will be defined by a total alkaline 
phosphatase level ≥ upper tertile of the reference range for the assay. At study start, patients will und ergo the 
initial double labeling procedure with tetracycline (TCN; 3 -days of TCN followed by 12 -days off TCN followed by 
3-days of TCN); during the labeling period etelcalcetide will not be administered (Figure 2 ). Patients will then 
undergo a 3 -month etelcalcetide dose -titration phase to ensure that PTH levels are consistently maintained 
within target range (300 -400 pg/mL) , followed by a 6 -month treatment (maintenance) phase. At the study 
endpoint (6 -months of tr eatment), the final set of labels for transiliac crest bone biopsy will be given (3 -days of 
demeclocycline followed by 12 -days off demeclocycline followed by 3 -days of demeclocycline) and bone biopsy 
will occur [ADDRESS_796947] label (TCN) is 
given prior to the initiation of etelcalcetide and the second label (demeclocycline) is given after 6 -months of 
treatment (maintenance) with etelcalcetide. The fluorescence of tetracycline and demeclocycline differs, 
permitting differentiation of the labels under fluorescence microscopy and determination of dynamic indices of 
histomorphometry pre - and post -intervention . To assess bone tissue level effects of treatment, we will use a 
Ram an/Nanoindentation system. This system allows the differentiation of tetracycline (pre -treatment) and 
demeclocycline (post -treatment) labels and permits precise measurement of localized b one tissue properties 
(e.g., mineral/matrix, collagen) and indentation properties (e.g., hardness) within these regions. Additionally, we 
will use [ADDRESS_796948] (µCT)  imaging (resolution 3 μm3) to obtain more complete structural indices 
from the b one biopsy specimens at the [ADDRESS_796949] blood collected and stored at -
80ºC, at baseline (pre -treatment) and after 3 - and 6 -months of treatment (i.e., maintenance phase) ( Table 1 ). 
Blood will be assayed for calcium, phosphorus, P TH, vitamin D metabolites, bone formation (bone specific 
alkaline phosphatase [BSAP], procollagen type -1 N-terminal propeptide [P1NP]) and resorption (C -Telopeptide 
[CTX]) markers, FGF -23 and sclerostin.   
Bone biopsy with quantitative histomorphometry and nanoindentation/Raman spectroscopy . After bone 
biopsy, t he specimens will be transferred to [CONTACT_54350]’s laboratory for tissue analysis (described below).  
µCT. 3D trabecular and cortical structure  will be assessed on biopsies before embedding using a Skyscan 
1172 system (scanning resolution of 6 µm3). Outcome measurements will include both cortical parameters 
(porosity [%], mineralization [average value and variation] and thickness) and trabecular parameters (BV/TV, 
trabecular number, separation, thick ness, and connectivity density) using manufacturer software and standard 
analytical protocols. At study initiation, we will perform short -term precision measurements on selected structural 
and mechanical properties. QC procedures are enforced by [CONTACT_106269] -house software system, and include weekly 
scanning of a QA/µCT phantom. The software system’s QA analysis monitors scanner performance and 
normalizes results for any fluctuations. QA data and specimen results can be exported to SAS or Excel.  
 Quantitative his tomorphometry . Following CT scans, specimens will be embedded in methyl methacrylate 
using standard protocols. Sections will be cut with a rotary microtome and either left unstained or stained with 
McNeal tetracrome or tartrate resistant acid phosphatase f or analysis. Histomorphometric indices will be defined 
in accordance with the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research5. The following histomorpho metric 
indices will be measured or calculated: osteoid surface, area, and width; osteoclast surface, eroded surface, 
resorption depth, resorption period; cancellous wall width, mineral apposition rate, bone formation rate, adjusted PTH, Vitamin D metabolites, Serum 
calcium and phosphorus, FGF -23,

will not be collected, as these will be obtained from CT as above.  
Bone-tissue properties . We will use an integrated Raman/Nanoindentation system, which permits p recise 
measurement of localized bone tissue properties (e.g., mineral/matrix, collagen) and indentation properties (e.g., 
hardness) within identical regions. Areas within the TCN  and demeclocycline double label will be assessed for 
nanoindentation properti es, and subsequently the same spatial location will be assessed for Raman -based 
measurements. Nanoindentation will occur using a Berkovich diamond indenter loading to a peak load of 10mN, 
a strain rate of 0.05 seconds and a holding period of 10 seconds. Ol iver and Pharr methods will be used to 
determine the stiffness and hardness of the unloading curves. A total of 12 -15 indentations will be performed 
within a given region. Following indentation, the same spatial regions will be assessed with Raman spectros copy 
to determine the phosphate and matrix peaks after background and baseline shift correction. The ratio of 
phosphate:mineral will be calculated, along with other parameters (crystallinity and collagen crosslinking).  
 
 
Hypothesis 2. Etelcalcetide will improve bone density, microarchitecture, and biomechanical 
competence in patients with ESKD.  
Aim 2.  To test if [ADDRESS_796950] with application of finite element analysis.  
Procedures.  We will enroll 35 patients (20 from Aim 1 and 15 de novo ) into this prospective  single -arm cohort 
study to test the hypothesis that 6 months of treatment (maintenance) with etelcalcetide will improve bone 
density, microarchitecture and mechanical competen ce measured by [CONTACT_602051] -pQCT with application of 
finite element analysis (FEA). Similar to Aim 1 , eligibility for enrollment into Aim 2  will be based on a PTH level 
>9-times the ULN for the PTH assay ( Figure 1 ), as well as their treating physician’s plan  to initiate etelcalcetide 
per standard of care. However, the presence of high turnover bone disease based on total alkaline phosphatase 
will not be a criterion for enrollment into Aim 2 . Furthermore, all patients enrolled in Aim 1  will be automatically 
enrolled into Aim 2  unless they choose to opt -out of Aim 2 . As per Aim 1  (Figure 2 ), after enrollment, patients 
will undergo a 3 -month dose titration phase to ensure that PTH levels are stability maintained within the target 
rage (300 -400 pg/mL) , followed by  a 6-month treatment (maintenance) phase.  All patients will have imaging 
(DXA and HR -pQCT) performed at baseline (prior to drug) and after 6 -months of maintenance treatment.  
Imaging Methods for Measurement of Bone Mass, Microarchitecture, and Mechanical C ompetence  
 DXA.  areal BMD of spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -4, AP), right proximal femur,  forearm  and whole  body  using Hologic QDR 4500 
(Hologic, Inc., Waltham, MA) in the array (fan beam) mode. Phantoms are scanned daily for QA. Short term, 
in vivo  precision is 0.68%, 1.36%, and 0.70% for spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], FN, and radius respectively.  
 HR-pQCT of the ultradistal radius and tibia . XtremeCT2 (Scanco Medical AG, Brüttisellen , Switzerland, 
voxel size 60µm). Methods and QC are described in our publications6, 7. Precision: cortical and volumetric 
trabecular BMD=0.9%±7.1% and 2.3±3.5%, respectively. HR -pQCT of the forearm will be performed at the 
non-dominant forearm. If dialysis access is located at the non -dominant forearm, we will use the dominant 
forearm  for HR -pQCT imaging.  
Mechanical Analysis of Skeletal Imaging.  Sanchita Agarwal MS will perform analyses of HR -pQCT datasets.  
HR-pQCT Finite Element Analysis (FEA) . [CONTACT_602072]  will estimate mechanical competence (strength) from 
HR-pQCT images . Each image is converted to a µFE model by [CONTACT_602052] 8 -node elastic 
brick elements . A uniaxial displacement equaling 1% o f the bone segment height is applied perpendicularly to 
the distal surface of the radius or tibia while the proximal surface is imposed with zero displacement along the 
same direction. The total reaction force is calculated from the linear µFE analysis, an d the axial stiffness is 
calculated as the reaction force divided by [CONTACT_602053].  
HR-pQCT Cortical Porosity.  [CONTACT_602072] will conduct analyses of cortical porosity using methods that have 
been described and validated in recent publications8.  
 
 
Hypothesis 3. Etelcalcetide decreases serum calcificati on propensity in patients with ESKD.  
Version Date: 1.3.[ADDRESS_796951] if 6 -months of treatment with etelcalcetide decreases serum propensity to calcify soft tissues. In 
a single -arm study of 35 patients with ESKD treated with 6 -months of etelcalcetide, we will measure T50, 
calciotropic hormones, serum calcium and phosphorus, bone turnover markers, FGF -23 and Sclerostin pre -
treatment and 3 - and 6 -months after treatment.  
Procedures.  We will enroll 35 patients (20 from Aim 1 and 15 de novo ) into this prospective single -arm cohort 
study to test the hypothesis that 6 months of treatment (maintenance) with etelcalcetide will decrease the 
propensity to calcify soft tissues as measured by T50. Similar to Aim 1 , eligibility for enrollment into Aim 3  will 
be based on a PTH level >[ADDRESS_796952] for the PTH assay ( Figure 1 ), as well as their treating physician’s 
plan to initiate etelcalcetide per standard of care. However, the presence of high turnover bone disease based 
on total alkaline phosphatase will not be a criterion for enro llment into Aim 3 . Furthermore, all patients enrolled 
in Aim 1  will be automatically enrolled into Aim 3  unless they choose to opt -out of Aim 3 . Thus, we will use the 
biochemical data from the 20 enrollees participating in Aim 1  and enroll an additional 15  patients to be treated 
with etelcalcetide. As per Aim 1  (Figure 2 ), after enrollment, patients will undergo a 3 -month dose titration phase 
to ensure that PTH levels are stability maintained within the  target range (300 -400 pg/mL) , followed by a 6 -month 
treatment (maintenance) phase. Patients will have blood collected and stored at -80ºC, at baseline (pre -
treatment) and after 3 - and 6 -months of treatment (i.e., maintenance phase). Blood will be assayed for T50, 
calcium, phosphorus, PTH, vitamin D metabolite s, bone formation (BSAP, P1NP) and resorption (CTX) markers, 
FGF-[ADDRESS_796953] of treatment on changes in levels of T50, a clinically relevant 
biomarker of calcification propensity9, 10. We will also determine relationships between changes in T50 and 
changes in phosphorus, calcium, bone turnover markers and calciotropic hormones.

Statistical methods (for analysis of primary and secondary endpoin ts or primary/interim analysis)   
For All Aims,  distributions will be examined and Anderson -Darling tests of no rmality and Q -Q plots will be used 
to guide the application of transformations to normalize the values prior to inferential testing. (Data analyzed 
from transformations will be reported in raw units). Inferential tests will be adjusted for multiple compari sons 
within a measurement domain (BMD within DXA, cortical, trabecular and FEA within HRpQCT, and each of the 
four compartments within histomorphometry) using a resampling, step -down procedure to control the family -wise 
error rate. We favor this over a fal se-discovery rate approach given the limited number of hypotheses within each 
measurement domain and that the measurement domains are traditionally seen as free to vary independently of 
each other11, 12. 
 
For Aim 1.  A two -tailed dependent T -test of the change in hardness measured by [CONTACT_602056] -indentation and 
mineralization measured by [CONTACT_602057]: 1.3.2020  outcome values from the pre -treatment baseline to the 6 -month endpoint will be reported with an alpha -level of 
5% as the criterion f or statistical significance. Outcome data missing, for whatever reason, will not be imputed.  
 
For Aim 2.  A two -tailed dependent T -test of the change in femoral neck BMD by [CONTACT_602058] -pQCT from pre -treatment to  the 6 -month endpoint will be reported with an alpha -level 
of 5% as the criterion for statistical significance. Secondary endpoints include treatment differences in change 
in cortical density, thickness and porosity, trabecular density and thickness and sp acing, and areal BMD at the 
forearm, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and total hip. Other predictors to be tested in multiple regression models of change from baseline 
include demographic characteristics collected in Aim [ADDRESS_796954] of the chang e in primary calcification propensity (T50) and secondary 
biochemical indices (calciotropic hormones, FGF -23, sclerostin, calcium and phosphorus) from pre -treatment 
baseline to the 6 -month endpoint will be reported with an alpha -level of 5% as the criterio n for statistical 
significance. Secondary exploratory analyses will assess the within -subject temporal course of change in the 
biochemical outcome with linear mixed models for repeated measures with time as a fixed effect (0, 3 and 6 
months); the baseline value of the dependent variable entered as a continuous covariate; and a covariance 
structure determined by [CONTACT_62866][INVESTIGATOR_602041]. We  will also assess whether the 
Aim [ADDRESS_796955] both of the two 
groups’ baseline values and of the two groups’ change in values from baseline to the [ADDRESS_796956] provider of hemodialysis in New 
York City and provides hemodialysis services to over 1300 patients. Approximately 25% of patients at Rogosin 
have PTH levels > [ADDRESS_796957] for the PTH assay. Therefore, there are adequat e numbers of patients at 
Rogosin who may be able and willing to participate in this prospective cohort study .

Sample Size for Aim 1.  N = 20  
Sample Size Justification for Aim 1.  The proposed sample size of 20 participants provides 80% power and 
5% alpha for a two -tailed dependent T -test of the within -subject difference in the pre - and post -treatment 
hardness measured by [CONTACT_602062]/nanoindent ation in the formation regions of 0.[ADDRESS_796964] change due to treatment sought here is expected to 
be relatively similar across subjects given the established efficacy of ete lcalcetide on other outcomes13. Behets 
et al14 reports patients with end stage renal disease show a baseline bone formation rate of 799 + 334 (mean + 
SD), a O.Pm/B.Pm(%) of 18.9 + 9.4 and a  E.Pm/B.Pm of 13.1 + 4.3 which assures a measurable region for the 
Ramen/nanoindentation assessment of hardness.  
 
Sample Size for Aim 2.  N = 35 (20 from Aim 1 plus 15 additional patients)  
Sample Size Justification for Aim 2.  The proposed sample size of 35 participants provides >80% power and 
5% alpha to detect a change in femoral neck BMD of 0.5% f and a 0.[ADDRESS_796965] from pre -treatment to the 6 -month endpoint. For femoral nec k BMD by [CONTACT_602063], 
Lien et al 15 reported that in 8 patients with CKD treated with cinacalcet for 6 months, areal BMD at the femoral 
neck increased 2.2 ± 1.1% (p < 0.05). For failure load outcomes, in a longitudinal study of 29 patients with ESKD 
who underwent kidney transplantation, we reported that failure load decreased by 3.5 ± 7.0% (p=0.0081) over 
12-months16; our larger sample size will permit detection of at least a 3.4% change in radius failure load due to 
suppression of PTH  production by [CONTACT_602064].  
 
Sample Size for Aim 3:  N = 35 (20 from Aim 1 plus 15 additional patients)  
Sample Size Justification for Aim 3:  The proposed sample size of 35 participants provides >80% power and 
5% alpha two -tailed dependent T -test of the ch ange in T50 from baseline to the [ADDRESS_796966] deviation (SD) decrease in T50 was associated with a 39% increase in odds of all -
cause mortality. Assuming that the variability in T50 in patients on hemodialysis patients enrolled into this 
prospective cohort study  are similar to those rep orted in Smith et al10, approximately [ADDRESS_796967] a 1 -SD decrease in T50. Our sample size of 35 patients will permit the detection of a 0.7 -
SDs decline in T50. We assume that a reduction of lesser magnitude is of unclear clinical signific ance
Version Date: 1.3.2020  Protection of Human Subjects  
This study qualifies as clinical research and will be conducted in compliance with GCP and all regulatory 
requirements for the protection of human subjects.  
 
Informed Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The purpose of the study will be explained to patients 
prior to recruitment as part of the informed consent procedures, which is defined as “to evaluate the effects of 
etelcalcetide on bone quality and the tendency of your soft tissue to calc ify”. The study methods, namely the 
assessment of physical exam and medical history; the evaluation by [CONTACT_602065]; the collection of blood; 
and bone biopsy will be described. The fact that the informed consent and the study protocol have been appro ved 
by [CONTACT_602066]. The potential risks and direct benefits to the patient will be explained. The 
potential benefit from this study to future patients will be explained. The fact that the patient has the option not 
to participate and will re ceive the same standard medical care regardless of participation will be emphasized. 
The rights of the patient, including the voluntary nature of participation and the right to withdraw the consent at 
any time, will be explained. We will also explain that this research does not affect the clinical management of the 
patient as determined by [CONTACT_602067]. In addition, patients will be informed that by [CONTACT_602068]. Thus, participating in this 
study should not put the subject at any risk for altering management deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_102] ’s 
nephrologist. The methods in place for maintaining patient confidentiality will be explained. This will include 
registering all data under a subject specific alpha -numeric system, storing all records in password protected and 
encrypted files. A copy of the signed informed consent will be placed in the patient ’s permanent medical record, 
a second copy of all consents wil l accompany the data to be kept in the PI ’s office, and a third copy will be 
provided to the participant.  
 
Potential Risks  
All key personnel involved in the design or conduct of research involving human subjects will have received the 
required education on  the protection of human research participants prior to funding of this project.  
 
The potential risks are related to  hypocalcemia,  loss of confidentiality, radiation exposure from DXA for 
measurement of bone density and HR -pQCT for measurement of volumetri c density and microarchitectural 
parameters and the bone biopsy procedure. All blood will be obtained from the dialysis line to avoid venipuncture.  
 Hypocalcemia.  Etelcalcetide has been associated with a decrease in serum calcium. We will monitor for 
and mi nimize this risk as described in the main protocol.  
 Loss of confidentiality . due to breaches in data security or deductive disclosure. To ensure that participants ’ 
confidentiality is not compromised, we will minimize these risks through the procedures disc ussed below.  
 Radiation . The total expected radiation dose for the entire study is approximately 8 mrem ( 80 µSv) for [ADDRESS_796968] flight. The total radiation exposure for the study will be below the maximal 
acceptable dose.  
a) CUMC DXA ( 2 sets of scans). Radiation exposure for DXA (sp ine, one hip, forearm) using the Hologic 
QDR4500 (fast scan) is 10.85 µSv ( 21.68  µSv for 2 sets of scans).  
b) HR-pQCT (one forearm and one leg; 3 sites each) . 30 µSv ( 60 µSv for 2 sets of scans)  
 Transiliac crest bone biopsy . The risks of the bone biopsy inclu de those related to tetracycline and 
demeclocycline administered in advance of the biopsy to label sites of bone formation, the risks of conscious 
sedation, and the risks of the biopsy itself. Tetracycline -type agents may cause stomach upset and skin 
rashe s when subjects taking them are exposed to sunlight. Subjects will be counseled to discontinue 
tetracycline/demeclocycline if gastrointestinal symptoms develop and to avoid sunlight exposure during the 
[ADDRESS_796969] brief, 
transient loss of protective reflexes . Either IV or PO sedation will be provided with a combinatio n of a 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  (e.g, midazolam, valium)  and a narcotic -based pain medication  (e.g., fentanyl, oxycodone) . 
Risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_602069] ’s Policies and Procedures 
Manual. Specifically, all nurses and physicians involved in performing bone biopsies will have certification in 
Advanced Cardiac Life Support, the proce dure will be conducted in the Biopsy Suite in the Division of 
Version Date: 1.3.2020  Nephrology at CUMC, and vital signs (including O 2 saturation) will be monitored at regular intervals during 
and after the procedure. An M.D. or Nurse -anesthetist will be present to administer th e conscious sedation. 
Complications from the biopsy are very unusual. Occasionally there will be a bruise at the site or discomfort 
at the biopsy site that persists for a few days.  
 
Protection against risk  
The risks of DXA, HR -pQCT, bone biopsy and loss o f confidentiality are described above. Provision for medical 
treatment, should it be required, will be included in the written informed consent; each subject will receive a copy. 
Confidentiality of patient data will be ensured. No patient will be identifia ble in any publications resulting from 
this study. Patients are identified by [CONTACT_602070]. Access to the computer data bank 
is limited by [CONTACT_374673].  
 Hypocalcemia.  We have implemented a protocol to monitor and manage hypocalcemia.  
 Radiation . DXA, and HR -pQCT have the risk of radiation exposure. The amount of radiation that participants 
will receive as a result of participation in the study will be discussed with eac h participant in detail as part of 
informed consent procedures. Females will undergo a urine pregnancy test prior to the DXA and HR -pQCT. 
Pregnant females will be excluded from the study at any time point in order to protect the unborn fetus.  
 Bone biopsy . The risks of bone biopsy will be included in informed consent procedures.  Furthermore, our 
use of a quadruple label method negates the need for 2 bone biopsy procedures.  
 Confidentiality . Only investigators and the study research staff will have access to t he data. All data are 
recorded with linkages to subject identities to be able to track changes over their longitudinal participation in 
the study. A data collection/tracking system developed for use in previous studies is used in this research, 
and will en sure confidentiality for all participants. All collected data will be identified by [CONTACT_602071]. Only the study investigators will have access to a master list with the study 
identification numbers and names. The master list  will be kept on a secure server on a research shared 
access network. All data containing PHI will be stored on password -protected encrypted CUMC computer or 
the secure research servers. Computers are password protected, encrypted and regularly backed -up to  
prevent data loss. Paper documents, such as consent forms, will be stored in locked cabinets in areas of 
restricted access. Only the research staff will have access to this information, unless written permission is 
received from the participant. The data collected as part of this study will be retained indefinitely. All data and 
records generated during this study will be kept confidential in accordance with Institutional policies and 
HIPAA on subject privacy, and the investigators and other site personnel  will not use such data and records 
for any purpose other than conducting the study.

Title Feasibility study to explore the safety and efficacy of cryolipolysis followed by 
[CONTACT_242854], randomized, interventional cohort 
Purpose The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sequential use of

submandibular area 
Enrollment Up to forty (40) subjects 
Clinical Site Up to three (3) investigational sites 
Subject 
Population Healthy adult men and women with skin fold thickness of > 1 cm in the submental 
and submandibular area who desire reducti on of submental and submandibular fat

Assessment of overall treatment outcome  in submental and submandibular area 
using Investigator-graded Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (IGAIS) at 12-
weeks post final treatment.  
Secondary

Although effective at reducing fat, these invasive and minimally-invasive procedures involve significant patient pain, expense, downtime, and the risks typi[INVESTIGATOR_229281]. As a result, patients who do not require significant fat reduction to achieve meaningful aesthetic results typi[INVESTIGATOR_229282]-invasive fat reduction and body contouring procedures to avoid the pain, expense, downtime, and surgical risks associated with invasive and minimally-invasive procedures.  ZELTIQ Aesthetics has developed and commercialized a technology to non-invasively reduce subcutaneous fat.  The ZELTIQ technology utilizes the sensitivity of fat cells to cold injury in order to selectively eliminate subcutaneous fat tissue without affecting the skin or other surrounding tissues. Termed cryolipolysis, this technology enables a non-invasive alternative for subcutaneous fat reduction through cellular apoptosis. The ZELTIQ CoolSculpting System, which is cleared for use in the [LOCATION_002] for an indication of fat layer reduction in the flanks, abdomen, thighs, bra fat, back fat, banana roll, upper arms, and submental and submandibular 
areas through cold-assisted lipolysis, has been clinically proven to reduce fat bulges, allowing 
patients to achieve noticeable and measurable aesthetic results without the pain, expense, downtime, and risks associated with existing invasive and minimally-invasive procedures.

The CoolSculpting System is comprised of a control unit (Figure 3 ) which houses the system 
controller and power source, and detachable applicators such as the CoolMini ( Figure 4), that are 
used to apply the cooling and/or warming to the treatment site. The vacuum applicators use 
vacuum pressure to draw tissue into the cup shaped applicator. Tissue drawn into the cup will be treated using a cooling parameter of -11
◦C for up to 45 minutes.

3. Visually assess and palpate the intended treatment area to determine if it is 
appropriate for treatment. 
4. Assess oral cavity for current dental infection or evidence of dry mouth.  
5. Assess function of the marginal mandibular  nerve (grimace with ability to show 
lower teeth) and hypoglossal nerve (tongue does not deviate upon protrusion).  
6. Assess upper neck to rule out enlarged lymph nodes or glands.  
7. Measure the skin fold thickness of the in tended treatment areas using a caliper. 
8. Assess for dermatological conditions or implantable devices that may lead to 
exclusion of a subject from the study. 
9. Document potential candidate’s medication use (including over -the-counter 
medications, vitamins and herbs), Fitzpatrick Skin Type, race and ethnicity as well as any skin irregularities (e.g. moles, birth marks, scars, stretch marks, 
discoloration) at the intended treatment area.  
 
All female subjects of childbearing potential wi ll be assessed for the start date of their 
last menstrual cycle to determine if they may be pregnant.  If unsure, a pregnancy test (urine) may be taken at the screening visit.  If the subject is pregnant, she will be 
excluded from participation.  Subjects will al so be advised to a void becoming pregnant 
during the course of the study by [CONTACT_2329] a medically accepted form of contraception if 
they are sexually active.  If the subject becomes pregnant during the course of the study, 
she will not be treated subsequently with th e study device or be required to have follow-
up photographs taken.   
 
All subjects will be asked to maintain their weight by [CONTACT_242861].  If a subject’s weight change 
is more than 5% at 12 weeks after the final treatment, the subjects’ data will be excluded from the primary effectiveness analyses. S ubjects who do not maintain their weight 
within 5% will continue in the study, however their data will be excluded from efficacy analyses.   
 
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criter ia and none of the exclusion criteria shall be 
eligible to participate in the study and the first treatment will be scheduled.

3.15.1. Statistical Methods: Overall Plan 
Data will be summarized based on the n ature of the data.  Dichotomous (e.g., 
gender, independent photographic review ) and ordinal (e.g., Fitzpatrick Skin 
type) data will be tabulated by [CONTACT_17203].  The mean, standard error, 
maximum and minimum will be tabulat ed for continuous data (e.g., age,).  
The significance level will be two-sided 0.05 for all statistical tests.  
3.15.2. Analysis Population 
Analysis Populations are defined as following: 
Per-protocol Population (PP): 
The Per-protocol Population will consist of all treated subjects followed for 
[ADDRESS_294531] the images, the primary 
efficacy analysis will be performed based on this study population. Subjects 
who do not complete treatment will not be included in the primary and 
secondary efficacy analyses. 
 
As-Treated Population (AT): 
This population consists of all treated subjects regardless of whether they 
become pregnant or undergo weight change during the study.   
 
Safety Population (SA): 
This population will consist of all treated subjects with safety evaluation after 
the treatment.  This population should be identical to the AT population.  The safety data analyses will be per formed based on the Safety Population.

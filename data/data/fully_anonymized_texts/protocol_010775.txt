4 SCHEMA  
 
 
 
 
This is a phase II trial to evaluate XL184 (cabozantinib) plus erlotinib in patients with  advanced 
NSCLC harboring an EGFR mutation who have progressed following EGFR TKI therapy. 
Patients may have received prior chemotherapy, and must have progression on erlotinib (retreatment with erlotinib is allowed). Patien ts will receive cabozantinib at 40 mg p .o. daily plus 
erlotinib at 150 mg p.o. daily.  All subjects will be monitored for clinical and biological 
responses and toxicity.  The cycle length is 28 days.  The duration of treatment will continue until subjects d evelop progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is to 
determine the response rate of XL184 (cabozantinib) and erlotinib in patients with an EGFR mutation who have progressed on erlotinib.  Archival tissue specimens and serial blood draws will be prospectively collected from all  
patients. Patients who have an additional biopsy following initial EGFR TKI therapy or after 
progression on study will have archival tissue collected to identify factors contributing to EGFR resistance (i.e. , EGFR T790M mutations, M ET amplification). Analysis of ligands, growth 
factors and soluble receptors will be conducted in serial  blood draws from all consenting 
patients, with an emphasis on baseline levels and changes in VEGF and HGF levels, as well as other ligands that may mediate resistance.

7 1. OBJECTIVES  
 1.1 Primary Objective  
 To evaluate for efficacy by [CONTACT_30530] (RR)  when patients with advanced  non- small cell lung 
cancer ( NSCLC) harboring an EGFR mutation who have progressed following EGFR TKI 
therapy are treated with XL184 (cabozantinib) and erlotinib.  
 1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
1.2.1 Determine PFS for combination XL184 (cabozantinib) and erlotinib in EGFR 
mutation positive patients following progression on erlotinib.  
1.2.2 Assess overall survival.  
1.2.3 Evaluate change in tumor growth rate on XL184 (cabozantinib) and erlotinib. 
1.2.[ADDRESS_686931] that promotes tumor proliferation, migration, stromal invasion, neovascularization, and resistance to apoptosis ( Shawver, Slamon et al. 2002 ).  A subgroup of patients with NSCLC 
that have specific mutations in the EGFR gene that correlate with clinical responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy ( Lynch, Bell et al. 2004; Paez, Janne et al. 2004) . These 
mutations lead to increased growth factor signaling and confer susceptibility to the inhibitor, and improved progression- free survival (PFS) when used as first -line therapy in advanced NSCLC 
(Mok, Wu et al. 2009 ; Mitsudomi, Morita et al. 2010) . Research evaluating which NSCLC 
patients respond to these agents reveals that the majority of responders have activating mutations in the EGFR gene, approximately 90% of which are deletions in exon 19 or L858R point mutations in exon 21.   However, not all NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations respond to EGFR -targeted therapy, and 
for those who initially respond to therapy, secondary resistance eventually develops. A specific EGFR mutation, T790M in exon 20, which generally develops after drug treatment is found in  
approximately 50% of patients with acquired erlotinib resistance (Pao, Miller et al. 2005 ). It 
remains unclear whether T790M is the cause of clinical resistance in this entire population. More recently, germline and de novo T790M mutations have been described, with decreased responsive ness to EGFR TKI therapy ( Bell, Gore et al. 2005 ; Tibaldi, Giovannetti et al. 2011 ; 
Su, Chen et al. 2012 ). This data adds evidence that MET and other mechanisms are highly 
involved in EGFR TKI resistance.  Focal amplification of the MET proto- oncogene promotes 
acquired EGFR TKI resistance in approximately 20% of cases ( Bean, Brennan et al. 2007; 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
8 Engelman, Zejnullahu et al. 2007 ; Turke, Zejnullahu et al. 2010) . In addition, overexpression of 
MET by [CONTACT_528917] a larger  group of patients that could respond to 
MET inhibition.  Other mechanisms of resistance in patients with activating EGFR mutations are still unknown.  Optimal therapy following progression on EGFR TKI therapy for patients with activating EGFR mutations after standard che motherapy is not established (Miller, Hirsch et al. 
2010) , although it has been demonstrated that sensitivity to EGFR inhibition can be regained  
(Sequist, Waltman et al. 2011) .  For patients who are not on clinical trial,  erlotinib or gefitinib 
can be  re-introduced, but limited data exists on its efficacy in this refractory population of 
patients ( Becker, Crombag et al. 2011). 
 2.2 XL184 (Cabozantinib)  
 XL184 (cabozantinib) inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) impli cated in tumor 
growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011).  The primary targets of XL184 (cabozantinib) are MET  and vascular endot helial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2 ); 
additional targets include RET, AXL, KIT, and TIE-2.  Both  MET and VEGFR2 are important 
mediators of tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis, and  i n vivo  pharmacodynamic activity of 
XL184 (cabozantinib) against MET and VEGFR2 has been demonstrated i n both preclinical and 
clinical studies.   
 RTKs regulate many processes including cell growth and survival, organ morphogenesis, 
neovascularization, and tissue repair (Christensen, Burrows et al. 2005) .  Dysregulation of RTKs 
by [CONTACT_147844], gene rearrangement, gene amplification, and overexpression of both receptor and 
ligand have been implicated as causative factors in the development and progression of numerous human cancers.  
 The RTK MET,  encodes the high- affinity receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or scatter 
factor (SF) ( Christensen, Burrows et al. 2005).  MET and HGF are each required for normal 
mammalian development and have been shown to be important in cell migration, morphogenic differentiation, and organization of three- dimensional tubular structu res (e.g., renal tubular cells, 
gland formation, etc. ), as well as cell growth, angiogenesis, and tumor invasiveness and 
metastasis.  Upregulation of MET is found in a wide range of malignancies including thyroid, prostate, ovarian, lung, and breast cancer s, and is associated with more aggressive and invasive 
phenotypes of cancer cells in vitro  and metastases in vivo  (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011).  MET-
driven metastasis may be exacerbated by a number of factors, including tumor hypoxia caused by [CONTACT_408229].  Evidence linking MET and HGF as causative or progression factors in human cancers include:  (1) the overexpression of both receptor and ligand in neoplasms relative to surrounding tissues; (2) the correlation of receptor a nd ligand overexpression with disease severity and outcome; (3) 
genetic alteration of MET  by [CONTACT_408230]; (4) 
introduction of MET and HGF (or mutant MET ) into cell lines , conferred the properties of 
tumorigenicity and metastatic propensity on engineered cells; (5) introduction of MET or HGF as transgenes into the germline of mice resulted in primary and secondary neoplasms; and (6) the inhibition of MET or HGF function with dominant-negative receptors, antibody antagonists

Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
9 (both Met and HGF), and biologic antagonists ( e.g., NK4) have reversed cancer -associated 
phenotypes such as motility, invasion and proliferation of tumor cells, and tumor growth and dissemination in vivo ( Christensen, Burrows et al. 2005). 
 
A wide variety of human cancers, including brain, colorectal, gastric, and lung, demonstrate dysregulated MET activity  (Liu, Newton et al. 2010), eithe r by [CONTACT_528918] ( Comoglio, Giordano et al. 2008 ), activating MET  gene mutations and/or 
amplification ( Jeffers, Schmidt et al. 1997 ; Schmidt, Duh et al. 1997; Comoglio, Giordano et al. 
2008) , or increased autocrine and/or paracrine secretion of the MET ligand, HGF/ SF 
(Birchmeier, Birchmeier et al. 2003 ; Boccaccio and Comoglio 2006; Comoglio, Giordano et al. 
2008).  These alterations have been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, and a high constitutive activation of MET has been correlated with poor clinical prognosis ( Birchmeier, 
Birchmeier et al. 2003 ). 
 
VEGFR2  is the predominant mediator of VEGF- stimulated endothelial cell migration, 
proliferation, survival, and enhanced vascular permeability ( Roskoski 2008) .  Increased 
expression of VEGFR2, often in combination with VEGFR3, has been observed in the tumor vascular endothelium in most common human solid tumor types, on tumor cells in melanoma and hematological malignancies, and in colitis- associated colon cancer  (Tugues, Koch et al. 
2011).  High VEGFR2 expression is an unfavorable prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) , and correlated with triple -negative ( i.e., therapy- resistant) breast cancer and 
poor survival. 
 
Nonclinical Development of XL184 (cabozantinib)   
 
In Vivo  Activity  
Inhibition of the VEGF signaling pathway was previously shown to result in more invasive tumors in the transgenic RIP -Tag2 mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer that 
spontaneously develops aggressive tumors ( Paez -Ribes, Allen et al. 2009 ).  In RIP -Tag2 
transgenic mice, tumors treated with XL184 (cabozantinib) were smaller ( P <0.05) than in mice 
treated with vehicle or an anti-VEGF antibody, but were also less invasive ( P <0.05) and had no 
liver metastases ( Sennino, Naylor et al. 2009).  A ll mice treated with XL184 (cabozantinib) (n = 
6) survived until 20 weeks, but none treated with vehicle (n = 14) or anti-VEGF antibody (n = 8) reached that endpoint.  Tumor vascularity decreased after treatment, with reductions ranging 
from 67% at 3 mg/kg to 83% at 30 mg/kg for 7 days ( You, Sennino et al. 2011).  Tumors were 
35% smaller after XL184 (cabozantinib) treatment than corresponding values for vehicle control mice.  MET protein expression in tumors was slightly decreased , but phosphorylated MET was 
markedly reduced after treatment for 7 days.   
 
Mice bearing MDA -MB-231 cells (expressing MET and VEGF) were administered four oral 
doses of 100 mg/kg ( Yakes, Chen et al. 2011).  XL184 (cabozantinib) increased tumor hypoxia 
(13-fold) and apoptosis (TUNEL; 2.5-fold) at [ADDRESS_686932] and second doses, respectively, when compared to vehicle- treated  tumors.  In addition, XL184 (cabozantinib) 
disrupted tumor vasculature by [CONTACT_528919].   XL184 (cabozantinib) treatment resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition of 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
10 MDA- MB-231 tumors ( P <0.001) at  all doses (1, 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg) when compared to 
vehicle-treated tumors.  Dose-dependent inhibition was observed for the 3 and 10 mg/kg doses (P <0.01), and complete inhibition was observed at the 30 and 60 mg/kg doses.  A single 100 
mg/kg dose resulted in sustained MDA -MB-231 tumor growth inhibition for ~8 days after which 
tumors began growing at a rate similar to vehicle-treated control tumors.  In addition, XL184 (cabozantinib)  inhibited tumor growth ( P <0.001) in the MET- expressing rat C6 glioma cell line 
for all doses (1, 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg) when compared with vehicle-treated tumors.  The 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses resulted in significant tumor regression (62% and 85%, P <0.0001) when compared with predose tumor weights.  Subchronic ad ministration of XL184 
(cabozantinib)  was well tolerated in mice and rats with no signs of toxicity, as determined by 
[CONTACT_408232]/or increasing body weights during the treatment period. 
 
ARCaP -M is a human prostate cancer model which expresses both MET and V EGF co -receptor 
NP-1 used in a human prostate tumor xenograft study in mouse bone ( Zhang, Zhau et al. 2010).  
ARCaP -M cells were injected into the tibia of nude mice on Day 1, and on Day 31 animals with 
established bone lesions  were randomized to receive XL184 (cabozantinib) or vehicle daily (qd) 
for 7 weeks of treatment (Investigator’s brochure, 2011).  Tibiae from vehicle- treated animals 
exhibited both osteoblastic and osteolytic lesions, whereas tibiae from XL184 (cabozantini b) 
treated animals appeared mostly normal.  Thus, XL184 (cabozantinib) treatment blocked both osteoblastic and osteolytic progression of ARCaP-M xenograft tumors in bone. 
 
Nonclinical Pharmacodynamics 
In mice, the effective dose resulting in 50% inhibition  (ED 50) of targets was achieved at well 
tolerated doses of XL184 (cabozantinib) and at plasma exposures comparable to exposure observed in clinical trials  (Investigator’s Brochure, 2010).  XL184 (cabozantinib) produced 
prolonged inhibition of receptor phosphorylation, such as sustained inhibition of MET and VEGFR2 for 10 hours after administration of a single dose of XL184 (cabozantinib) .  This 
extended inhibition occurred in a manner that was generally predicted by [CONTACT_408233], i.e., inhibition was dim inished when plasma levels fell below approximately 20 μM for MET, 5 μM 
for VEGFR2, and 23 μM for TIE -2. 
 
Once daily administration of XL184 (cabozantinib)  resulted in significant inhibition of MET 
phosphorylation in TT tumors, relative to tumors from vehicle control -treated mice, with 
maximal inhibition of 70% seen at 60 mg/kg (Investigator’s Brochure, 2010).  Dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of MET  and RET was observed among the 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg 
dose groups as well .   
 
MET phosphorylation was inhibited by a single 100 mg/kg oral dose of XL184 (cabozantinib), 2–[ADDRESS_686933] dose in H441 tumors (human lung papi[INVESTIGATOR_448553]) that harbor constitutively phosphorylated MET ( Yakes, Chen et al. 2011 ).  This effect was reversible, as 
MET phosphorylation returned to basal levels by 48 hours after treatment.    
Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
In the various xenograft models, plasma exposures were similar and plasma concentrations in the range of 3 to 27 μM were associated with efficacy (Investigator’s Brochure, 2010).  In rats, 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
11 plasma concentrations in the range of 5 to 15 μM were associated with maximal anti -tumor 
activity.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_528892], trough concentrations as low as 0.1 μM were observed at highly efficacious doses in mice.  These results were consistent with in vivo  target modulation studies in mice which demonstrated long (4- to 10- hour) durations 
of action, and indicated that continuous high exposure was not required to maintain efficacy.   
 
Dose proportional increases in exposure occurred at oral doses of 3–100 mg/kg in mice and at 3–30 mg/kg in rats (Investigator’s Brochure, 2010).  In rats, the oral bioavailability of XL184 (cabozantinib)  dosed as a solid was approximately 100% of XL184 (cabozantinib) dosed as a 
liquid.  In comparison, oral bioavailability was much lower in dogs (20%) and monkeys (18%) for the solid versus liquid dosage forms. 
 
Systemic drug exposure parameters (maximum plasma concentration [C
max] and area under the 
time-concentration curve from [ADDRESS_686934]- dose [AUC 0-t] values) associated with single 
XL184 (cabozantinib) oral doses in rats increased less than dose -proportionally with increasing 
dose (100–900 mg/kg)  (Investigator’s Brochure, 2010) .  With repeat daily oral dosing in rats, 
systemic exposure (AUC 0-t values) increased generally dose -proportionally following 14 and 178 
dosing days (dose ranges 1–15 mg/kg/day and 0.1–1 mg/kg/day, respectively).  The C max and 
AUC 0-t values in rats administered 100 mg/kg were approximately 2-fold and 3-fold higher, 
respectively, than for dogs given 2000 mg/kg; therefore, the higher systemic exposure to XL184 (cabozantinib)  in rats correlated with the greater toxicity observed in this species at lower 
administered doses. 
 
Systemic drug exposure parameters (C
max and AUC 0-t values) associated with single XL184 
(cabozantinib)  oral doses in dogs increased less than dose-proportionally with increasing XL184 
(cabozantinib)  dose (400–2000 mg/kg), suggesting possible saturation of systemic absorption 
(Investigator’s Brochure, 2011).  With repeat daily dosing, exposure (C max and AUC 0-24 values) 
both increased greater than dose-proportionally from 10 to 100 mg/kg and less than dose proportionally from 100 to 1000 mg/kg following 14 dosing days.   
 
Toxicology 
In rodents and non-rodents, histopathological changes associated with XL184 (cabozantinib) administration were observed in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, and adrenal and reproductive tract tissues (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011).  Histopathological changes present in the bone and pancreas were considered secondary to XL184 (cabozantinib) ad ministration. Adverse effects following oral exposure to XL184 
(cabozantinib)  were generally dose -related, clinically monitorable, and self- resolving upon 
discontinuation of dosing. In 6-month chronic toxicity studies, treatment- related changes were 
presen t only in kidney (rats) and reproductive tissues (dog).  In reproductive/developmental 
toxicity studies, XL184 (cabozantinib) administration resulted in decreased fertility in male and female rats, in embryotoxicity when given to pregnant rats, and in a vi sceral tissue malformation 
(small spleen) when given to pregnant rabbits. The no-observable-adverse- effect -levels 
(NOAELs) for the chronic toxicity and reproductive/developmental toxicity studies occurred at plasma exposures (AUC) below steady -state values  measured in subjects with solid tumors 
administered 175 mg XL184 (cabozantinib) capsule form daily (Study XL184-001).

12  In definitive genotoxicity bioassays, XL184 (cabozantinib) was negative in an S. typhimurium/E. coli bacterial mutagenicity study, an in vitro  chromosome aberration study using human 
peripheral blood lymphocytes, and an in vivo  mouse bone marrow micronucleus study 
(Investigator’s Brochure, 2010).  In safety pharmacology studies, no adverse effects occurred on neurobehavioral or respi[INVESTIGATOR_408177]184 (cabozantinib)- treated rats or on 
cardiovascular function in XL184 (cabozantinib)-treated dogs. 
 Clinical Experience  
 One thousand two hundred and eighty six patients have been studied in 12 ongoing Exelixis-sponsored clinical trials with XL184 (cabozantinib) treatment 1) as a single agent at does ranging 
from 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg on an intermittent dosing schedule, 2) from 25 to 265 mg (19.7-209 mg freebase equivalent weight) on a fixed daily dosing schedule and 3) in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy (RT), or with erlotinib (Exelixis Communication, 2011).  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on once daily (qd) by [CONTACT_1966] (PO) dosing schedule was determined to be 175 mg L-malate salt (or approximately 138 mg freebase equivalent weight).  
 Detailed information for each of these studies, including pharmacokinetic data, can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (2012).  Safety and efficacy information, from the 2012 
Investigator’s Brochure, is summarized below.  
 
Phase I  Studies  
 Study XL184 -001 was a phase 1 dose -escalation study in subjects with solid tumors.  Eighty- five 
subjects, across 13 dosing levels (DL) ranging from 0.08 mg/kg qd to 11.52mg/kg (using powder- in-bottle [PIB] suspension on a 5 days on, 9 days off schedule), and at 175mg qd and 
265mg qd (using PIB suspension), and at 175mg qd and 250mg qd (using capsules [25 and/or 100mg]) for two, 14- day cycles were enrolled.  The capsule MTD was determined to be 175 mg 
qd (Kurzrock et al ., 2011).  Of the 35 subjects with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and 
measureable disease, 10 (29%, 95% CI) had confirmed partial responses (cPR) (with a duration up to 48+ months), 17 (49%) had tumor shrinkage of ≥30%, and stable disease (SD) of at least 6 months was observed in 15/37 (41%) of the MTC subjects.  In Study XL184 -002, treatment of subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GB) consisted 
of cabozantinib in combination with TMZ with or without radiation therapy.  Enrollment has been terminated and no clinical efficacy data is presented in the 2011 Investigator’s Brochu re.  
All adverse events (AEs) were assessed with respect to combination treatment and not the individual components.  Nineteen patients were evaluated for AEs, the most common grade 3 or higher included neutropenia (21%), thrombocytopenia (16%), leucopenia (16%), and hypertension (11%).  Myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, is a dose- limiting 
toxicity (DLTs) associated with TMZ use.  The frequency at which bone marrow toxicity was observed in this study is consistent with the TMZ prescribing information.

Study XL184 -[ADDRESS_686938] (100 mg 
cabozantinib, dosed as one 100- mg tablet) or Reference (100  mg cabozantinib, dosed as two 
50-mg capsules), according to a randomization scheme.  Each dosing was administered under fasting conditions, and blood samples were collected up to [ADDRESS_686939] after each treatment to assess plasma cabozantinib PK.   See “Pharmacokinetics” section for 
results.  
 
In Study XL184 -008, subjects with advanced solid tumors (particularly renal cell carcinoma 
[RCC] and differentia ted thyroid cancer [DTC]) are evaluated for any potential clinically 
significant drug -drug interaction of cabozantinib on the CYP isozyme CYP2C8.  The effect of qd 
dosing of [ADDRESS_686940] common grade 3 or higher AEs were fatigue (9%), hypophosphatemia (27%), blood amylase increase (9%), and hyponatremia (9%).  In a phase [ADDRESS_686941] cohort experienced DLTs of proteinuria and thrombocytopenia.  A total of 14 subjects in the dose- escalation portion of the study were 
treated across 3 dosing levels ranging from 50 mg qd to 100 mg qd. The capsule MTD was determined to be 75 mg administered qd. Because of a change in study sponsor, this study was reinitiated as XL184 -014.   
 Study XL184 -202 was a phase 1b/2 trial that evaluated the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib 
and erlotinib administered in combination in non- small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subjects.  Of 
the 64 subjects enrolled in the phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the study, all but two had been previously treated with and progressed on erlotinib therapy.  A cPR was observed in 5 subjects 
(8%) and 24 subjects (37%) had SD/PR ≥ [ADDRESS_686942] common grade 3 or higher AEs in 
the phase 1 portion included diarrhea (44%), fatigue (22%), hypokalemia (11%), decreased 
appetite (6%), dyspnea (14%), lipase increase (6%), hypomagnesemia (6%), and dehydration (5%).  Twenty -eight subjects were enrolled in the phase 2 portion of the study, in which subjects 
who had received clinical benefit from erlotinib and subsequently experienced progressive 
disease (PD), received single-agent cabozantinib or cabozantinib with erlotinib.  AEs ≥ grade 3 
included dehydration (8%) and hypertension (8%).  One patient, who was treated with single-
agent cabozantinib, had a cPR. 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, [ADDRESS_686943] or second 
relapse were enrolled to receive cabozantinib qd as a single agent.  Group A received an initial dose of 175 mg (Group A), subsequent cohorts (Groups B and C) received an initial dose of 125 mg.  Forty-six subjects were enrolled in Group A, and a total of 176 subjects were enrolled in Groups B/C.  Fifty- seven subjects experienced one or more serious adverse events ( SAEs) that 
were assessed to be related to treatment, including five fatal related.  
 Study XL184 -203 was a phase 2 randomized discontinuation trial.  Subjects were enrolled into 
one of nine tumor- specific cohorts: breast cancer, gastric/gastroesophageal (GEJ) cancer, 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).  Eligible subjects with advanced solid tumors receive open-label cabozantinib at starting dose of [ADDRESS_686944] or second relapse.  Subjects received one of four regimens: 25 mg qd (Arm 1) continuously, 75 mg qd (Arm 2) continuously, 125 mg qd for 2 weeks followed by 50 mg qd continuously 
(Arm 3), and 125 mg qd on an intermittent 3 week on/1 week off schedule (Arm 4).  A total of 
[ADDRESS_686945] experienced an SAE assessed to be related to 
treatme nt with cabozantinib.  
 Study XL184 -301 is a blind trial for subjects with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic 
MTC, randomized 2:1 to cabozantinib or placebo.  SAEs reported in Study XL184-301 are: one grade 4 reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), one grade [ADDRESS_686946] following asystolic vagal reaction after aspi[INVESTIGATOR_528893], and three SAEs of acquired trachea-esophageal fistula (two grade 3, one grade 5).  
Adverse Events 
The clinical studies with XL184 (cabozantinib) are ongoing and thus the AE data from the clinical database as of March 1, 2011 and May 4, 2011 do not yet include all SAEs (Exelixis Communication, 2011).  As of March 2011, AE data are available for [ADDRESS_686947] been dosed with XL184 (cabozantinib) (806 in single-agent studies and 107 in combination studies of XL184 (cabozantinib) with erlotinib, rosiglitazone, or TMZ ± radiation) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011).  Data from the 806 subjects who received single-agent XL184 (cabozantinib)  show that the most frequently (>20%) observed AEs regardless of causality were 
fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, decreased appetite, constipation, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, vomiting, dysphonia, and hypertension.  Effects that may be relat ed to the 
inhibition of VEGF, including hypertension, thromboembolic events, GI perforation, fistula formation, hemorrhage, wound dehiscence, and proteinuria, have been observed in the single-agent and combination XL184 (cabozantinib) studies.  The most commonly reported SAEs that 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
15 were assessed as related to study treatment with XL184 (cabozantinib) (as a single-agent or combination) were pulmonary embolism (PE), diarrhea, dehydration, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), vomiting, nausea, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, wound dehiscence, and PPE syndrome.  There have been 15 grade 5 AEs related to study treatment: GI hemorrhage (two subjects), PE (two subjects), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (two subjects), respi[INVESTIGATOR_44447] (one subject), hemoptysis (one subject), death due to unknown cause (two subjects), intracranial hemorrhage (one subject), intestinal perforation (one subject), enterocutaneous fistula (one subject), hemorrhage (presumed to be hemoptysis; one subject), and diverticular perforation, peritonitis (one subject) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011).  
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of 74 patients in trial XL184-001 showed dose proportional increases in maximum plasma concentration (C
max) and AUC both for PIB (dose range 0.08- 11.52 mg/kg) 
and the capsule formulation (dose range: 125 to 175 mg) ( Kurzrock, Sherman et al. 2011).  
Terminal -phase half -life (t 1/2,z) values were 59.1 to 136 hours (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011).  
After repeat dosing, t1/2,z values (mean ± standard deviation) for XL184 (cabozantinib) were 91.3 
± 33.3 hours (n = 23), and apparent steady- state plasma levels were reached by [CONTACT_2006] 15 
(Kurzrock, 2011).  Steady- state clearance for the 175 mg capsule dose derived from repeat dose 
data was 4.2 ± 1.5 L/h.  Patients who received 175 mg capsules had four- to five- fold higher 
steady -state exposure (AUC) compared with Day 1 (7.68 ± 2.85 mcg∙h/mL; n =  23 vs. 41.6 ± 
15.3 mcg∙h/mL; n = 23), indicating that XL184 (cabozantinib) accumulated with repeat daily dosing.  There was no significant difference in exposure between patients with MTC and those without MTC. 
 
Based on the preliminary PK data from 23 subjects in XL184 -005 who completed both 
treatments, after a single oral dose of cabozantinib at 100 mg, the terminal t
1/2, z of cabozantinib 
appeared to be similar for both tablet and capsule formulations, with approximately mean values of 110 hours (Exelixis Communication, 2012).  The median time to the maximum plasma concentration (t
max) was [ADDRESS_686948] variability for C max and the area under the plasma drug 
concentration time curve (AUC) values were observed for both formulations (coefficient of variation [CV]% C
max: 51% for the tablet formulation, 61% for the capsule formulation; CV% 
for the AUC from time zero to the last quantifiable time point or to infinity [AUC 0-last or AUC 0-
inf]: 40-43% for the tablet formulation, 43% for the capsule formulation).  The geometric mean 
Cmax of the tablet formulation was approximately 39% higher than the value observed for the 
capsule formulation.  The geometric mean AUC 0-last and AUC 0-inf values for the tablet 
formulation were also higher (15% and 19%, respectively) than those observed for the capsule formulation.  However, due to the high within- formulation variability observed, no statistical 
difference in exposure between the two formulations was apparent.  
 Based on the preliminary PK data from 46 subjects who completed both treatments on trial XL184 -004, a high- fat meal did not appear to alter the terminal t
1/2, z of cabozantinib [mean t 1/2, z 
: 131 hours (fed) vs 128 hours (fasted)].  The high- fat meal significantly increased the median 
tmax to 6 hours from 4 hours (fasted).  The high- fat meal also significantly increased both the 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
16 cabozantinib C
max and AUC values by 39% and 56%, respectively.  The geometric mean ratio of 
Cmax fed/fasted was 1.39 (90% CI: 1.16-1.67), and the geometric mean ratio of AUC 0-last 
fed/fasted was 1.56 (90% CI: 1.34-1.80).  Based on this result, cabozantinib must be taken on an empty stomach (fasting is required 2 hours before and 1 hour after each cabozantinib dose).  Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184-006, showed that concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of 
cabozantinib in healthy volunteers.  Co-administration of cabozantinib with strong inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) may significantly decrease cabozantinib concentrations.  The chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided.  Other drugs that induce CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to decrease exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib (e.g., chronic use of modafinil) should be avoided because of its potential to reduce cabozantinib exposure.  Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme induction potential is recommended.  In addition, caution must be used when discontinuing treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer in a subject who has been concurrently receiving a stable dose of cabozantinib, as this could significantly increase the exposure to cabozantinib.   Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184-007, showed that concurrent 
administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in a 33-39% increase in the cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers.  Co-administration of cabozantinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir) may increase cabozantinib concentrat ions.  Grapefruit / grapefruit juice and Seville 
oranges may also increase plasma concentrations of cabozantinib.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to increase exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib. Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition potential is recommended. 
 
2.3 Erlotinib (OSI -774) 
 Erlotinib (OSI-774 Tarceva®) is an orally active, potent, selective inhibitor of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (Erlotinib Investigator's Brochure, 2012). Erlotinib inhibits the human EGFR tyrosine kinase with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2 nM (0.786 ng/mL) in an in vitro enzyme assay and reduces EGFR autophosphorylation in 
intact tumor cells with an IC50 of 20 nM (7.86 ng/mL). Erlotinib inhibits EGF-dependent proliferation of cells at submicromolar concentrations an d blocks cell -cycle progression in the 
G1 phase.   Erlotinib appears to bind specifically to EGFR. In a study of erlotinib binding specificity, affinity of erlotinib for 67 cellular receptors was examined (Erlotinib Investigator's Brochure, 2012). Erlotinib was shown to bind with low affinity to peripheral benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (IC50=2.5 μM [980 ng/ml]), adenosine A1 (IC50=6.8 μM [2700 ng/ml]), and μ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] (IC50=7.0 μM [2800 ng/ml]) 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
17 receptors. Binding affinities were 1250-fold higher than the IC50 concentration needed to inhibit purified EGFR tyrosine kinase (2 nM [0.79 ng/ml]). When tested at concentrations up to 1 μM (390 ng/ml), no significant inhibition of ligand binding to 64 other neurotransmitter receptors, regulatory binding sites, calcium channels, opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328], or neurotransmitter uptake sites were observed.   Non-Clinical Studies  
 In mice, daily oral administration of erlotinib for 20 days inhibited subcutaneous (SC) growth of the HN5 human head and neck carcinoma in a dose-dependent manner as compared to vehicle-treated mice, with an estimated effective dose for 50% inhibition (ED50) of 9.2 mg/kg/day (Erlotinib Investigator's Brochure, 20 12). Treatment with 11 mg/kg/day of e rlotinib immediately 
halted growth or slightly decreased the size of HN5 tum ors >[ADDRESS_686949] -treatment. Similar 
results were observed i n A431 squamous cell carcinoma xenografts at a dose of 11 mg/kg/day 
erlotinib over 20 days.   Erlotinib (10 mg/kg/day) has been studied in combination with cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel, vinorelbine tartrate, and gemcitabine (Erlotinib  Investigator's Brochure, 
2012). No antagonism of therapeutic efficacy was observed, and additive effects were observed 
with cisplatin (10 mg/kg intravenous [IV] daily × 1), doxorubicin (15 mg/kg IV daily × 1), 
paclitaxel (10 mg/kg intraperitoneal [IP] daily × 5), and gemcitabine (100 mg/kg IP three times daily × 4).   Nonclinical toxicology studies in rats and dogs have included acute and long- term general 
toxicology, genetic toxicology, reproductive toxicology, and local tissue tolerance of erlotinib. Clinical signs of toxicity in rats and/or dogs following a single dose of e rlotinib were dose 
dependent and included transient emesis, ataxia, papi[INVESTIGATOR_179995], increased heart rate, decreased blood pressure, decreased activity, irregular respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], convu lsions, rapid chewing, 
salivation, and death. Following chronic administration in rats and dogs, the following toxicities were observed in at least one species: effects on the cornea (atrophy and ulceration); effects on the skin (follicular degeneration and inflammation, redness, and alopecia); atrophy of the ovary, lacrimal glands, and salivary glands; necrosis of the liver; papi[INVESTIGATOR_528894]; inflammation in the mandibular lymph nodes; hematopoiesis; delayed gastric emptying; and diarrhea. Increases in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin were observed.   Erlotinib causes maternal toxicity with associated embryo -fetal lethality and abortion in rabbits 
at doses 3 times those in humans (AUC  at 150 mg daily dose). However, when administered 
during organogenesis at plasma concentrations approximately equal to humans, no increase in embryo- fetal lethality or abortion in rats or rabbits was observed. Female rats treated with doses 
0.[ADDRESS_686950] week of gestation had an increase in early resorptions. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats or rabbits.

Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
18 Pharmacokinetics  
 The total clearance of erlotinib decreased with increasing dose, re sulting in supraproportional 
increases in exposure (AUC) over the dose range of 1 -2 mg/kg IV in rats and 0.5-7 mg/kg IV in 
dogs (Erlotinib Investigator's Brochure, 2009). In vitro , erlotinib is slowly oxidized by [CONTACT_528920]. The majority of the absorbed dose is extensively metabolized in rats and dogs, and only a small amount is excreted as unchanged drug in urine, bile, and feces. The oral bioavailability of an aqueous suspension is 77% in rats and ~88% in dogs. Plasma protein binding of e rlotinib ra nges from 92% to 95% in man, monkey, rat, and mouse, and is 85% in the 
dog. Corrected for protein binding of 95%, at the average plasma concentration responsible for 50% inhibition of tumor growth (oral dose of 9.2 mg/kg/day in the murine/human tumor xenograft model), the unbound concentration of drug in the plasma is estimated to be 86 nM (34 ng/mL). The estimated unbound concentration of e rlotinib in plasma is consistent (4 -fold higher) 
with the IC50 for the in vitro cellular phosphotyrosine reduction assay and is 43- fold higher than 
the IC50 for the in vitro (isolated enzyme) tyrosine kinase assay. Finally, Erlotinib plasma 
protein binding depends on the levels of α -1-acid glycoprotein (AAG). Thus, AAG might be a 
significant determinant of pharmacokinetic and possibly pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationships in patients.  
 Erlotinib pharmacokinetics were examined in patients with advanced solid tumors who were treated daily for 21 days. Plasma samples were collected on Days 1, 3, and 21 for analysis. The 
following table lists the pharmacokinetic data for these patients:

After oral ingestion, the Erlotinib Cmax values (Tmax) were achieved at a median of 3 hours (range, 2 to 12 hours). Both Cmax and AUC0-24 values w ere roughly proportional to the 
erlotinib dose in the range of 25 to 200 mg/d (R2 = 0.33 and 0.46, respectively, on Day 1). Inter-subject variability was moderate at the 150 -mg/d dose level, as indicated by [CONTACT_528921] 64% for Day 1 AUC0 -24 and Cmax.

Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, [ADDRESS_686951] for novel antiangiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The combination of EGFR TKI therapy and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition was evaluated in the phase III BeTa trial (Herbst, Ansari et al. 
2011). Bevacizumab/  erlotinib did not improve overall survival versu s placebo/erlotinib, but 
prolonged PFS and was associated with a higher response rate.  Additionally, the MET  inhibitor 
ARQ197 improved outcomes when combined with erlotinib, which may provide a mechanism to overcome EGFR resistance ( Sequist, von Pawel et al. 2011 ).  In a recent phase 2 study (XL184-
202) combining XL184 (cabozantinib) + erlotinib, PR was seen in 3 patients with prior erlotinib therapy and prolonged SD was demonstrated in a patient with a T790M mutation (9+ months).   Evidence suggests that MET and VEGF are important in NSCLC tumorigenesis and EGFR TKI 
resistance. Therefore, we hypothesize that treatment with XL184 (cabozantinib) plus erlotinib in EGFR mutation -positive NSCLC following EGFR TKI therapy may allow for tumors to 
overcome this resistance or restore sensitivity to therapy.    This trial will evaluate the comb ination of XL184 (cabozantinib) with erlotinib in patients with EGFR -mutant NSCLC who 
have progressed on EGFR TKI therapy.    Potential correlative markers will be studied by [CONTACT_528922], and in a subset of patients; if available, pre -treatment  tissue samples 
will be analyzed for T790M mutation and MET amplification to better understand mechanisms 
for overcoming resistance in these patients.

The patient will be requested to maintain a medication diary (see Appendix  D) of each dose of 
medication. The medication diary will be returned to clinic staff at the end of each course. Patients will be instructed to record doses as they take them (and not to batch entries at a later time) and how to correct errors if they occur.   
 
5.1.1 XL184 (cabozantinib)  XL184 (cabozantinib) must be taken on an empty stomach without  eating 2 hours before 
through 1 hour after taking XL184 (cabozantinib).  
If the patient vomits after taking the tablets, the dose is replaced only if the tablets can 
actually be seen and counted.  
• Avoid the use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, voriconazole) 
• Do not ingest foods or nutritional supplements (e.g., grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges or products made with grapefruit or Seville oranges) that are known to inhibit cytochrome P450. 
• Avoid the use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital).  
• Do not ingest foods or nutritional supplements (e.g., St. John’s Wort (Hypericum 
perforatum)) that are known to induce cytochrome P450 activity. 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
29 • Cabozantinib should be taken at approximately the same tim e each day.  If a dose is 
missed and it is less than 12 hours till the next dose, the missed dose should not be taken.  The next dose should be taken at the normal time. 
• Cabozantinib is highly protein bound (approximately 99.9%) to human plasma proteins. 
Medications that are highly protein bound (eg, diazepam, furosemide, dicloxacillin, and 
propranolol) should be used with caution during cabozantinib treatment. Because 
warfarin is a highly protein bound drug with a low therapeutic index, administration of 
warfarin at therapeutic doses should be avoided in subjects receiving cabozantinib due to the potential for a protein binding displacement interaction. 
• Treatment with cabozantinib has been associated with a mild prolongation of the QTc 
interval.  Caution should be used when treating subjects on cabozantinib with other drugs 
associated with QTc prolongation (see http://www.qtdrugs.org).  Additional QTc monitoring is suggested for subjects who are treated concomitantly with QTc prolonging drugs. Some [ADDRESS_686992] agents (e.g. odansetron, granisetron) can prolong the QTc 
and should be used with caution.  Alternative medications for nausea and vomiting should be used when possible.

Proton pump inhibitor : Erlotinib's solubility decreases as the pH increases. 
Coadministration of omeprazole with erlotinib will decrease the AUC and C max by 46% 
and 61%, respe ctivel y.  Caution must be observed when administering erlotinib with 
omeprazole.  
 
H2-antagonist : Avoid concomitant use of erlotinib with gastric acid-reducing agents if 
possible. When ranitidine 300 mg is given with erlotinib, erlotinib AUC and C max 
decrea se by 33% and 54%, respectively. Increasing the dose of erlotinib will not 
compensate the loss of exposure. However, if an H2-antagonist receptor is needed, take erlotinib at least [ADDRESS_686994] 
NCI Protocol #: 9303

and C
max of 17%.  
 
Smoking: Advise smokers to stop smoking while taking erlotinib. Smoking induces CYP1A2 enzymes and alters erlotinib exposure by 64%.   Food-drug interaction: Avoid grapefruit /grapefruit juice (potent CYP3A4) while taking erlotinib.

5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 Because there is a potential for interaction of XL184 (cabozantinib) and erlotinib with other concomitantly administered drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, the case report form must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over-the- counter medications, or alternative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_528895]450 isoenzymes.   
 
5.2.1 Concomitant Medications and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Anticancer Therapy  
 
If a subject requires additional systemic anticancer treatment, study  treatment must be 
discontinued.  Local intervention is discouraged unless medically unavoidable.  Subjects receiving local intervention ( e.g., palliative radiation) are allowed to 
continue to receive study treatment at the investigator’s discretion.   
 [IP_ADDRESS] Other Medications  
 
Subjects must be instructed to inform the investigators of the current or planned use or all other medications during the study (including prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins and herbal and nutritional supplements).  It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that details regarding all medications are documented.  Bisphosphonates started prior to screening activities or initiated during the course of the study to control bone pain may be used with caution.  Colony stimulating factors ( e.g., erythropoietin and granulocyte colony- stimulating 
factors) and pain medications administered as dictated by [CONTACT_528923] #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, [ADDRESS_686995] dose of study treatment.   No concurrent investigational agents are permitted.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Potential Drug Interactions 
 
Cytochrome P450:  Preliminary data from a clinical drug interaction study (Study 
XL184-008) show that clinically relevant steady-state concentrations of cabozantinib appear to have no marked effect on the AUC of co- administered rosiglitazone, a 
CYP2C8 substrate.  Therefore, cabozantinib is not anticipated to markedly inhibit CYP2C8  in the clinic, and by [CONTACT_151998], is not anticipated to markedly inhibit other 
CYP450 isozymes that have lower [I]/Ki values compared to CYP2C8 ( i.e., CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4).  In vitro  data indicate that 
cabozantinib is unlikely to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible induction of CYP1A1 at high cabozantinib concentrations (30 μM).  
 Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate (but not a CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 substrate), based on data from in vitro  studies using CYP- isozyme specific neutralizing 
antibodies.  
 
Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184-006, showed that concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers.  Co-administration of cabozantinib with strong inducers of the CYP3A4 family ( e.g., dexamethasone, 
phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) may significantly decrease cabozantinib concentrations.  The use of 
strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided.  Other drugs that induce CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to decrease exposure (AUC) to caboza ntinib (e.g. , chronic use of modafinil) should be avoided 
because of its potential to reduce cabozantinib exposure.  Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme induction potential is recommended.  In addition, caution must be used when discontinuing treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer in a subject who has been concurrently receiving a stable dose of cabozantinib, as this could significantly increase the exposure to cabozantinib.   Preliminary results from a clinical p harmacology study, XL184-007, showed that 
concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in a 33-39% increase in the cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers.  Co -administration 
of cabozantinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family ( e.g., ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir) may 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
32 increase cabozantinib concentrations.  Grapefruit / grapefruit ju ice and Seville 
oranges may also increase plasma concentrations of cabozantinib.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers should be avoided, and CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers that are not strong, should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to increase exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib. Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition potential is recommended.   Because in vitro  studies o nly assessed the metabolizing capacity of the CYP3A4, 
CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 pathways, the potential for drugs that inhibit/induce other CYP450 pathways ( e.g., CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, CYP1A2) to alter 
cabozantinib exposure is not known.  Therefore, these drugs should be used with caution when given with cabozantinib.   Please refer to the Flockhart drug interaction tables for lists of substrates, inducers, and inhibitors of selected CYP450 isozyme pathways (Flockhart 2007; http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx).   
Protein Binding :  Cabozantinib is highly protein bound (approximately 99.9%) to 
human plasma proteins.  Therefore, highly protein bound drugs should be used with caution with cabozantinib because ther e is a potential displacement interaction that 
could increase free concentrations of cabozantinib and/or a co-administered highly protein -bound drug (and a corresponding increase in pharmacologic effect).  Factors 
that influence plasma protein binding may affect individual tolerance to cabozantinib.  Therefore, concomitant medications that are highly protein bound ( e.g., diazepam, 
furosemide, dicloxacillin, and propranolol) should be used with caution.  Because warfarin is a highly protein bound drug with a low therapeutic index, administration of warfarin at therapeutic doses should be avoided in subjects receiving cabozantinib due to the potential for a protein binding displacement interaction.  
 
Drugs Associated with QTc Prolongation:  Treatment with cabo zantinib has been 
associated with a mild prolongation of the QTc interval.  Caution should be used when treating subjects on cabozantinib with other drugs associated with QTc prolongation (see 
http://www.qtdrugs.org ).  Additional QTc monitoring is suggested 
for subjects who are treated concomitantly with QTc prolonging drugs. Some [ADDRESS_686996] agents (e.g. odansetron, granisetron) can prolong the QTc and should be used with caution.  Alternative medications for nausea and vomiting should be used when possible. 
 
Other Interactions: In a relative bioavailability study in dogs, cabozantinib exposure 
was not significantly affected by [CONTACT_528924]. Nevertheless, drugs such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-antagonists produce profound suppression of gastric acid secretion and significant increases in gastric pH.  By [CONTACT_528925], PPIs and H2 -antagonists may decrease cabozantinib plasma exposure levels and its 
effectiveness in vivo , resulting i n clinically significant drug interactions.  The use of 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
33 PPIs ( e.g., omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole) 
and/or H 2-antagonists ( e.g., ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine) is discouraged 
during this study.  If antacids are not adequate, the use of H 2 blockers is preferred 
over PPIs ( Note : Cimetidine should be avoided because of its potential to interfere 
with CYP3A4 mediated metabolism of cabozantinib).  Antacids, H [ADDRESS_686997] 2 hours (preferably 4 hours) after taking cabozantinib but at least [ADDRESS_686998] that cabozantinib is unlikely to be a substrate for P glycoprotein 
(P-gp), but it does appear to have the potential to inhibit the P-gp transport activity.  
 Additional details related to these overall conclusions are provided in the Investigators Brochure for XL184 (cabozantinib).  
 5.3 Duration of Therapy  
 In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue until one of 
the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression ,  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or 
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 
 
• Necessity for treatment with other anticancer treatment prohibited by [CONTACT_760],  
 
• Sexually active subjects who refuse to use medically accepted barrier methods of contraception ( e.g., male condom, female condom) during the course of the study and 
for 4  months following discontinuation of study treatment, 
 
• Women who become pregnant or are breast feeding,  
• Request by [CONTACT_528926], or  
• Significant noncompliance with the protocol schedule in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].

 A window of +/ - 3 days is allowed for the start of cycles following cycle 1.  Patients will be 
withdrawn from study if they fail to recover to CTCAE grade 0-2 (or within one grade of starting value for pre- existing laboratory abnormalities) from a treatment-related toxicity within 6 weeks 
(leading to treatment delay of >6 weeks due to AEs).

XL184 (cabozantinib)- Related Adverse Event Management  
 
Subjects will be monitored continuously for AEs throughout the study. Subjects must be 
instructed to notify their physician immediately for any and all toxicities . 
 
General guidelines for the management of non- hematologic and hematologic toxicities are 
provided in Tables 6- 3, 6-4, 6-5, 6- 6, 6-7, 6-8, 6-9, and 6- 10. As a general approach, it is 
suggested that all AEs be managed with supportive care when possible at the earliest signs of toxicity. Calcium, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus should be kept above the lower limits of the laboratory normal values. For more spe cific guidelines on gastrointestinal AEs (diarrhea,

4mg at first onset, followed by 2mg every 2- 4 hours until diarrhea resolves for 12 
hours ).  Patients should notify their physician immediately at the first signs of poorly formed or 
loose stool or an increased frequency of bowel movements.  Administration of antidiarrheal agents is recommended at the first sign of diarrhea as initial management.  Loperamide is recommended as standard first line therapy.  Alternatively, diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_528896].  Additional agents to consider in subjects with diarrhea that is refractory to the above include 
deodorized tincture of opi[INVESTIGATOR_342845] ( Benson, Ajani et al. 2004) .  Some subjects may 
require concomitant therapy with loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and deodorized tincture of opi[INVESTIGATOR_342846].  The dose modification guidance in Table 6-[ADDRESS_687005] agents (e.g. odansetron, granisetron) can prolong the QTc and should be 
used with caution.  Alternative medications for nausea and vomiting should be used when possible. The 5 -HT3 receptor antagonists are recommended over chronic use of NK- 1 receptor 
antagonists and dexamethasone (NK-1 receptor antagonists can induce or inhibit CYP3A4, and glucocorticoids induce CYP3A4 and thus could lower cabozantinib exposure.)  Caution is also recommended with the use of nabilone, which is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4.  
Stomatitis and Mucositis 
 
Preventive measures may include a comprehensive dental examination to identify any potential complications before study treatment is initiated.  Appropriate correction of local factors should be instituted as indicated, such as modification of ill -fitting  dentures and appropriate care of 
gingivitis.  During treatment with cabozantinib, good oral hygiene and standard local treatments such as non- traumatic cleansing, and oral rinses ( e.g., with a weak solution of salt and baking 
soda) should be maintained.  The oral cavity should be rinsed and wiped after meals, and dentures should be cleaned and brushed often to remove plaque. Local treatment should be instituted at the earliest onset of symptoms.  When stomatitis interferes with adequate nutrition and local therapy is not adequately effective, dose reduction or temporary withholding of cabozantinib should be considered.

40  Cabozantinib treatment should also be interrupted when transaminase increases are accompanied by [CONTACT_408251], and/or elevations of coagulation tests ( e.g., 
International Normalized Ratio [INR]).  Monitoring of transaminases should be intensified (2 –3 
times per week) and cabozantinib  should be held until the etiology of the abnormalities is 
determined and these abnormalities are corrected or stabilize at clinically acceptable levels (INR 
< 1.5 ×  ULN, total bilirubin <  1.5 ×  ULN, aminotransferases ≤ baseline grade).  
 
Subjects must have cabozantinib permanently discontinued if transaminase elevations are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_528930] (bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN), in the 
absence of evidence of biliary obstruction ( i.e., significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase) or 
some other explanation of the injury ( e.g., viral hepatitis, alcohol hepatitis), as the combined 
finding ( i.e., Hy’s Law cases) represents a signal of a potential for the drug to cause severe liver 
injury.

rash (including blister, erythematous rash, macular rash, skin exfoliation, dermatitis acneiform, and papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, erythema, pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491], and alopecia have been 
reported in cabozantinib- treated subjects .  All subjects on study should be advised to use 
prophylactic measures for skin care.  These measures includes the use of hypoallergenic mois turizing creams, ointment for dry skin, sunscreen with SPF ≥30; avoidance of exposure of 
hands and feet to hot water; protection of pressure- sensitive areas of hands and feet; and use of 
thick cotton gloves and socks to prevent injury and to keep the palms and soles dry. Subjects 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
42 with skin disorders should be carefully monitored for signs of infection ( e.g., abscess, cellulitis, 
or impetigo).  Early signs of hand-foot syndrome can include tingling, numbness, and slight redness or mild hyperkeratosis.  Early  manifestations include painful, symmetrical red and swollen areas on the 
palms and soles.  The lateral sides of the fingers or periungual zones may also be affected.  Adequate interventions are required to prevent worsening of skin symptoms such as blisters, desquamations, ulcerations, or necrosis of affected areas.  Aggressive management of symptoms is recommended, including early dermatology referral.  Treatment guidelines for PPE related to study treatment are presented in the table below.  
 In the case of study treatment- related skin changes ( e.g., rash, hand-foot syndrome), the 
investigator may request that additional assessments be conducted with the subject’s consent.  These assessments may include digital photographs of the skin changes and/or a biopsy of the affected skin and may be repeated until the skin changes resolve.

Embolism and Thrombosis  
 
Deep vein thrombosis and PE have been observed in clinical studies with cabozantinib; including fatal events (please refer to the IB).  Subjects who develop a PE or DVT should have study treatment held until th erapeutic anticoagulation with heparins is established.  Study treatment 
may be resumed with a one dose-level reduction in subjects who have uncomplicated PE or DVT and are deriving clinical benefit from study treatment..  During treatment with anticoagula nts, 
subjects need to be monitored on an ongoing basis for bleeding risk and signs of bleeding.  Subjects with life -threatening PE or DVT should have study treatment discontinued unless 
toxicity can be managed and subject is deriving clear clinical benefit as determined by [CONTACT_528934].  Venous filters ( e.g. vena cava filters) are not 
recommended due to the high incidence of complications associated with their use.  Once a subject is fully anticoagulated, treatment can be restarted per investigator judgment at one dose lower.  Subjects should permanently discontinue after a second thrombotic event.  Although 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
44 routine prophylactic anticoagulation is not necessary for all subjects, prophylactic anticoagulation is allowed for indivi dual subjects at the discretion of the investigator.  
 Arterial thrombotic events (e.g., transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction) have been observed rarely in studies with cabozantinib.  Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects who develop an acute MI or any other clinically significant arterial thromboembolic complication.  
 Hypertension  
 Hypertension is a relatively common complication of other VEGF -pathway inhibitors and has 
been observed in cabozantinib clinical studies.  Decisions to decrease or hold the dose of study treatment must be based on BP readings taken by a medical professional and must be confirmed with a second measurement at least [ADDRESS_687022] measurement.  Subjects with known hypertension should be optimally managed prior to study entry.  Clinical judgment should be used in deciding whether new or worsened hypertension emerging during treatment with cabozantinib requires immediate therapy, or whether therapeutic intervention can be delayed in order to confirm the finding of new or worsened hypertension at a second visit before taking new therapeutic action.  It is recommended that this second visit occur within 1  week.  Blood pressure should be monitored in a constant 
position visit to visit, either sitting or  supi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Cabozantinib dosing should be interrupted in 
subjects with severe hypertension (180 mm Hg systolic or 120 mm Hg diastolic; or sustained 
≥160 mm Hg systolic or ≥110 diastolic) who cannot be controlled with medical interventions and discontinued in subjects with hypertensive crises or hypertensive encephalopathy (see next Table below).

 Proteinuria  
 Proteinuria has been reported with approved drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with 
cabozantinib.  Any level of proteinuria diagnosed by [CONTACT_408256] a UPCR (mg/dL protein / mg/dL creatinine).  When a UPCR exceeds 1, a repeat UPCR or a 24-hour urine 
protein and creatinine should be performed to confirm the result. Cabozantinib should be

cabozantinib at a reduced dose by [CONTACT_30560].  Continue 
monitoring UPCR once every week until two consecutive 
readings are < 1, then revert to UPCR monitoring frequency

Guidelines for the Prevention of Hemorrhagic Events 
 Hemorrhagic events have been reported with approved drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with cabozantinib .  As preventive measures, subjects should be evaluated for potential 
bleeding risk factors prior to initiating cabozantinib treatment and monitored for bleeding events with serial complete blood counts and physical examination while on study.  Risk factors for hemorrhagic events may include (but may not be limited to) the following: 
 
• Tumor lesions with cavitations or tumor lesions which invade, encase, or abut major blood vessels.  The anatomic location and characteristics of primary tumors or metastases as well as 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
47 the medical history should be carefully reviewed in the selection of subjects for treatment with cabozantinib. 
• Recent or concurrent radiation to the thoracic cavity.  
• Active peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis, and other inflammatory GI diseases.  
• Underlying medical conditions which affect normal hemostasis ( e.g., deficiencies in clotting 
factors and/or platelet function, or thrombocytopenia). 
• Concomitant medication with anticoagulants or other drugs which affect normal hemostasis. 
• History of clinically sig nificant hemoptysis. 
 Based on the described predisposing risk factors for hemoptysis, many studies with 
antiangiogenic drugs exclude subjects with NSCLC and squamous cell differentiation. Although 
enrollment of subjects with NSCLC with squamous cell differentiation has been allowed on cabozantinib studies, cabozantinib studies exclude NSCLC subjects with any of the following: tumors abutting, encasing, or invading a major blood vessel; cavitating lesions; history of clinically significant hemoptysis; or recent radiation therapy to the thoracic cavity including brachytherapy unless radiation therapy targets bone metastasis.  Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with serious and life-threatening bleeding events or recent hemoptysis (≥0.5 teaspoon (2.5mL) of red blood).  Treatment with cabozantinib should be interrupted if less severe forms of clinically significant hemorrhage occur and may be restarted after the cause of hemorrhage has been identified and the risk of bleeding has subsided at a dose agreed to by [CONTACT_16998].  Therapy of bleeding events should 
include supportive care and standard medical interventions.   Furthermore, subjects who develop tumors abutting, encasing, or invading a major blood vessel or who develop cavitation of their pulmonary tumors while on study treatment must be discontinued from cabozantinib treatment.  Rectal and Perirectal Abscess  Rectal and perirectal abscesses have been reported, sometimes in subjects with concurrent diarrhea. These should be treated with appropriate local care and antibiotic therapy. Cabozantinib should be held until adequate healing has taken place.   Guidelines for Prevention  of GI Perforation/Fistula and Non -GI Fistula Formation  
 GI perforation/fistula and Non- GI fistula f ormation have been reported with approved drugs that 
inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with cabozantinib. Carefully monitor for epi[INVESTIGATOR_151949], especially in subjects with known risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_151950]/fistula or non- GI fistula, to allow for early diagnosis. Such risk factors include (but 
may not be limited to) the following:  
 
GI-perforation/fistula : 
 
• Intra -abdominal tumor/metastases invading GI mucosa.  
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
48 • Active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, cholecystitis or symptomatic cholangitis, or appendicitis .  
• History of abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra- abdominal abscess  
• Prior GI surgery (particularly when associated with delayed or incomplete healing). Complete  healing following abdominal surgery or resolution of intra- abdominal abscess must 
be confirmed prior to initiating treatment with cabozantinib.  
 Additional risk factors include concurrent chronic use of steroid treatment or non- steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs.  Constipation indicative of bowel obstruction should be monitored and effectively managed.  
 
Non-GI fistula : 
 
• Radiation therapy has been identified as a possible predisposing risk factor for non -GI fistula 
formation in subjects undergoing treatment with drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways.  In 
addition, subjects who have undergone extensive surgery may be at increased risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a fistula of the involved organs Non- GI fistula should be ruled out as appropriate 
in cases of onset of mucositis after start of therapy.  
  Discontinue all study treatment in subjects who have been diagnosed with GI or non- GI 
perforation/fistula.  
 Wound Healing and Surgery  
 VEGF in hibitors can cause wound healing complications and wound dehiscence which may 
occur even long after a wound has been considered healed. Therefore, surgical and traumatic wounds must have completely healed prior to starting cabozantinib treatment and be monitored for wound dehiscence or wound infection while the subject is being treated with cabozantinib.  
 Treatment with cabozantinib must be interrupted for any wound healing complication which needs medical intervention. Treatment with cabozantinib can be resumed once wound healing has occurred unless otherwise prohibited in specific protocols. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with serious or chronic wound healing complications.  The appropriate dose hold interval prior to elective surgery to reduce the risk for wound healing complications has not been determined. In general, cabozantinib should be stopped at least 3 weeks (5 half lives) prior to elective surgery.  
 Endocrine Disorders  
 Prospective studies of markers of thyroid functions are currently ongoing in two single- agent 
studies to characterize the effects of cab ozantinib on thyroid function. P reliminary data indicate 
that cabozantinib affects thyroid function tests (TFTs) in a high number of subjects (see 
Cabozantinib Investigator’s Brochure).  Routine monitoring of thyroid function and assessments 
for signs and symptoms associated with thyroid dysfunction is recommended for subjects treated 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
49 with cabozantinib. Management of thyroid dysfunction ( e.g., symptomatic hypothyroidism) 
should follow accepted clinical practice guidelines.  
 Other endocrine disorders such as hypocalcemia and hyperglycemia, and associated laboratory changes, have been observed in less than 10% of subjects.  Monitoring with standard laboratory tests for endocrine disorders and clinical examination prior to initiation and during treatment with c abozantinib is required.  Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with severe or 
life-threatening endocrine dysfunction. 
 Guidelines for Prevention  of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw  
 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported with use of antiangiog enic drugs and 
bisphosphonates and denosumab in cancer patients.  Additional risk factors for ONJ have been identified such as use of corticosteroids, chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, smoking, dental or orofacial surgery procedures, and cancer disease itself.  Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported in subjects treated with cabozantinib, the details of which are provided in the current version of Investigator’s Brochure.  As a preventive measure, invasive dental procedures should be avoided if possible in subjects who have previously been treated with or concomitantly receive bisphosphonates or denosumab. In cases where dental procedures are unavoidable, the risks and benefits of a dental procedure and the extent of the procedure as well as the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_528897] a temporary treatment interruption of cabozantinib.  If clinically possible, treatment with cabozantinib should be held for at least [ADDRESS_687025] be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_17190] a case by [CONTACT_413].  Guidelines for Management of Treatment -Emergent Corrected QT (QTc) Prolongation  
 Treatment with cabozantinib has been associated with a mild prolongation of the QTc interval.  Other factors which may contribute to QTc prolongation include 
• Treatment with other drugs associated with QTc prolongation (see 
http://www.qtdrugs.org). 
• Treatment with CyP 3A4 inhibitors (which may increase cabozantinib drug levels) 
• Electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia). 
• Medical conditions which can alter electrolyte status e.g., severe or prolonged diarrhea. 
 
Subjects having any of these additional risk factors while on cabozantinib must have ECGs 
performed approximately one week after the onset of these factors.  
 If at any time on study there is an increase in QTc interval to an absolute value >500 msec, two 
additional ECGs should be performed within 30 minutes after the initial ECG with intervals not

Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
50 less than 3 minutes apart.  I f the average QTcF from the three ECGs is >[ADDRESS_687026] be withheld and the following actions should be taken:  
• Check electrolytes, especially potassium, magnesium and calcium.  Correct abnormalities as clinically indicated.  
• If possible, discontinue any QTc -prolonging concomitant medications. 
•  Repeat ECG triplets hourly until the average QTcF is ≤[ADDRESS_687027] has been thoroughly evaluated, and further treatment has been agreed to by [CONTACT_1034].  If any additional study treatment is given ( e.g., after correction of electrolyte abnormalities and 
normalization of QTcF), it will be at a reduced dose as agreed to by [CONTACT_5226].

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigator s MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY  Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
 An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_300794], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the NCI via CTEP -

 7.5 Secondary Malignancy 
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
CTEP requir es all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP- AERS . Three options are available to describe the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
7.6 Second Malignanc y 
 A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).   Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting 
via CDUS  unless otherwise specified .  
  8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with XL 184 and Erlotinib administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1.  
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
64 8.1 CTEP IND Agent(s)  
 8.1.1 XL184 (cabozantinib) (NSC 761968)  
Chemical Name:  
N-{4-[(6,7-dimethoxyquinolin-4-yl)oxy]phenyl}- N’-(4-
fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxamide, (2S)-hydroxybutanedioate  
 Other Names: cabozantinib, EXEL -7184, EXEL-02977184  
 
Classification : Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Inhibitor (RTK)  
 
CAS Registry Number : 1140909-48-3  
 Molecular Formula:  C28H24FN3O5.C4H6O5   M.W.:  635.6  
 
Mode of Action :  
XL184 (cabozantinib)  inhibits multiple RTKs implicated in tumor growth, 
metastasis, and angiogenesis, and targets primarily MET and VEGFR2.  Other targets are RET, AXL, KIT, TIE -2, and FLT -3.  
 
How Supplied:  
XL184 (cabozantinib) - NSC 761968 - will be provided free of charge by [CONTACT_528936] (PMB), Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI).  
 
XL184 (cabozantinib) 20 mg will be supplied as tablets for oral administration.  
The XL184 (cabozantinib) tablets contain XL184 (cabozantinib), microcrystalline cellulose, lactose anhydrous, hydroxypropyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal silicon dioxide, and magnesium stearate.  The Opadry Yellow film coating on the tablet contains HPMC 2910 /hypromellose 6 cp, titanium dioxide, triacetin, and iron oxide yellow.     XL184 (cabozantinib) will be supplied in bottles containing 30 – 20 mg tablets of 
XL184 (cabozantinib) with a child -resistant c ap and tamper evident seal.  Dispense 
XL184 in its original bottle; however, XL184 is stable up to 24 hours when dispensed in an open container such as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_408200], and up to 7 days when dispensed in a closed container such as a pharmacy bottle other than th e original 
container.  
 
Administration:    
Take XL184 (cabozantinib)  on an empty stomach, do not eat 2 hours before through 
1 hour after. Do not crush or chew.   
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
65  
Stability:  
Stability testing of the intact bottles is on -going.  XL184 (cabozantinib) is stabl e up 
to 24 hours when dispensed in an open container such as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_408200], and up to 7 days when dispensed in a closed container such as a pharmacy bottle other than the original container.  
 
Potential Drug Interactions:   
XL184 (cabozantinib) is a substrate of CYP3A4.  Co -administration of XL184 
(cabozantinib) with medications that are strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided. Examples of strong CYP3A4 inducers are rifampin, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifabutin, rifampentin, Phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir.  Use alternative medications.  Avoid grapefruit/ grapefruit juice and Seville oranges while participati ng in this trial.  
 In vitro data indicate that XL184 (cabozantinib) is unlikely to be a substrate for P -
glycoprotein, but it does appear to have the potential to inhibit the P -glycoprotein 
transport activity.  Additional details related to these overall conclusions can be found in the investigator brochure.  
 XL184 (cabozantinib) is highly protein bound, 99.9%.  Use caution when co-administering XL184 (cabozantinib) with medications that are highly protein- bound 
(e.g., diazepam, furosemide, dicloxacillin, and propranolol).  Avoid administration of warfarin with XL184 (cabozantinib) as warfarin is highly protein -bound and has a 
very narrow therapeutic index.  
 Avoid concomitant use of XL184 (cabozantinib) with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H
2 –antagonists, if possible.  The PPIs and H 2–antagonists may decrease XL184 
(cabozantinib) plasma exposure levels and its effectiveness in humans.  Examples of PPIs are omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole; examples of H
2 –antagonists ar e ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine.  Cimetidine is 
a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.  Avoid using cimetidine with XL184 (cabozantinib).  If needed, antacids are recommended for the initial treatment of dyspepsia or indigestion.  If antacids are not adequa te, the use of H2 blockers (other than 
cimetidine) is preferred over PPIs.  If antacids, H
[ADDRESS_687039] 2 hours (preferably 4 hours) after taking XL184 (cabozantinib) but at least 14 hours before the next dose of XL184 (cabozantinib) if possible.  
 
Potential Food Effect:  
The effect of food on the bioavailability of XL184 (cabozantinib) was evaluated in healthy adult subjects in a Phase 1, open- label, randomized, single -dose, two-
treatment, two way crossover study (Study X L184- 004).  Based on the preliminary 
PK data, a high fat meal did not appear to alter the terminal t1/2, but significantly 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
66 increased the median tmax to 6 hours from 4 hours (fasted).  The high fat meal also significantly increased both the XL184 (cabozantinib) Cmax and AUC values by 41% and 57%, respectively.  Based on this result, XL184 (cabozantinib) should be taken on an empty stomach [fasting is required 2 hours before and 1 hour after each XL184 (cabozantinib) dose].  
 
Patient Care Implications:    
Do not take grapefruit/ grapefruit juice or Seville oranges while participating in this 
trial.  Inform physician and study healthcare team about current medications including over the counter drugs, herbals, or natural medicines.  There are many H2-blockers a nd PPIs available over- the-counter (OTC) such as cimetidine or 
omeprazole. For dyspepsia or indigestion, use an antacid first, then an H2 blocker if not relief with an antacid.  Do not use cimetidine.  Take an antacid, an H2 blocker, or a PPI [CONTACT_2669] 2 ho urs (preferably 4 hours) after taking XL184 (cabozantinib) but 
at least 14 hours before the next dose of XL184 (cabozantinib) if possible.  
 
Drug Returns:   
            Only undispensed drug supplies (no partial bottles) should be returned to the 
PMB.  When it is necessary to return study drug (e.g., sealed bottles remaining 
when expi[INVESTIGATOR_528902]), investigators should return the study drug to the PMB using the NCI Return Agent Form available on the NCI 
home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov
).

8.1.2 Erlotinib/OSI -774 (718781) 
 
Chemical Name : N- (3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7- bis(2 -methoxyethoxy)-4-
quinazolinamine, monohydrochloride  
 
Other Names:  E rlotinib hydrochloride, Tarceva ™ 
 
Classification:   Tyrosine kinase Inhibitor (EGFR)  
 Molecular Formula : C
22H23N3O4 HCl    
 M.W .:  393.4 (free base) 429.9 (hydrochloride salt) 
 Mode of Action : Direct inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase  
 How Supplied:  Erlotinib  tablets are provided by [CONTACT_528937]/NCI as    25 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
67 white film -coated immediate -release tablets packaged in high-
density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle.  Each bottle contains 30 tablets.   
 The tablets are round and convex without markings.  The 25 mg tablets are 1/4 inches (6 mm); the 100 mg tablets are 11/32 inches (9 mm); and the 150 mg tablets are 13/32 inches (10 mm). OSI -774 excipi[INVESTIGATOR_270130], 
microcrystalline cellu lose, sodium starch glycolate, sodium 
lauryl sulfate, and magnesium stearate.  
 Storage :    Store the intact HDPE bottles as per label’s instruction.  
 Stability:  Current data indicates erlotinib  is stable for at least 3 years at 
room temperature. 
 Route of Administration :  Oral.  
  Method of Administration :  
 
• Tablets should be taken once daily preferably in the morning with up to 200 mL of 
water on an empty stomach 2 hours before through 1 hour after. 
 Potential Drug Interaction: Erlotinib  is highly protei n bound (92% to 95% in humans) and 
metabolizes primarily via CYP3A4 enzymes.  Dose OSI -774 cautiously with agents that are 
highly protein bound or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers enzymes.  
 
CYP Iso -Enzymes Inhibitors/Inducers:  
o Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors:  U se alternative drug.  Alternatively, reduce erlotinib  
dose in the event of drug interaction (if permitted by [CONTACT_760]).  
o Potent CYP3A4 inducers:  Use alternative drug.  If an alternative treatment is contraindicated, consider increasing the erlotinib  dose (if permitted by [CONTACT_760]).   
 
o Food -drug interaction:  Avoid grapefruit /grapefruit juice (potent CYP3A4) while 
taking erlotinib . 
 
o Smoking:  Advise smokers to stop smoking while taking erlotinib .  Smoking induces 
CYP1A2 enzymes and alters erlotinib  exposure by 64%. 
 
Anticoagulant :  Concomitant NSAIDs, warfarin or warfarin -derivatives may increase 
bleeding and PT /INR. Dose adjustment may be needed.  
 
Proton Pump Inhibitor :  Erlotinib ’s solubility decreases as the pH increases. Co -
administration of omeprazole with erlotinib  will increase the AUC and C max by 46% and 
61%, respectively.  
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, [ADDRESS_687040] : Avoid concomitant use of erlotinib  with gastric acid reducing agents if 
possible.  When ranitidine 300 mg is given with erlotinib , erlotinib  AUC and C max  decrease 
by 33% and 54%, respectively.  Increasing the dose of erlotinib  will not compensate the loss 
of exposure.  However, if an H 2-antagonist receptor is needed, take OSI -[ADDRESS_687041] administration.  Dosing such,  
erlotinib  loss of exposure is minimized to AUC of 15% and C max   of 17%.   
 
Gastrointestinal perforation :  Concomitant use of anti -angiogenic agents, corticosteroids, 
NSAIDs, and/or taxane based chemotherapy, or patients with prior medical history with peptic ulcers or diverticular disease are at high risk of GI perforation while on erlotinib  
treatment.  Discontinue erlotinib if GI perforation manifests.  
 Patient Care Implications: If patient vomits after taking the tablets, readminister the 
dose only if the tablets can actually be seen and counted. Recommend patients to use sunscreen protection, and wear hat and long sleeve shirts as sunlight can exacerbate skin reactions.  
  
8.1.3 Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] NCI-supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized 
designee) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management B ranch 
(PMB) policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the 
patient is to be treated.   PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between 
institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained).  The CTEP- assigned 
protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP-supplied investigational agents.  The responsible investigator at each participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum  Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and 
Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).   If there are several participating investigators at 
one institution, CTEP-supplied investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_170739].  
 
Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator- designated shippi[INVESTIGATOR_528903] (OA OP) application ( https://eapps-
ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx).   Access to OAOP requires the 
establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account  
(https ://eapps-ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam/ ) and the maintenance of an “active” account 
status and a “current” password.   For questions about drug orders, transfers, returns, 
or accountability, call ( [PHONE_032] Monday through Friday between 8:30 am and 
4:30 pm (ET) or email [EMAIL_087] anytime. 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
69 Agent Inventory Records – The investigator, or a responsible party designated by [CONTACT_093], must maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of all agents received from DCTD using the NCI Drug Accountability Record Form (DARF).  (See the NCI Investigator’s Handbook for Procedures for Drug Accountability and Storage.)  
 
 9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 9.[ADDRESS_687042] tissue collected to identify factors contributing to EGFR resistance (i.e., EGFR T790M mutations, MET amplification). Analysis of ligands, growth factors and soluble receptors will be 
conducted in serial blood draws from all consenting patients.  Tumor specimens:  
1.   For all patients, tumor positivity for EGFR will have been established  prior to enrollment 
as routine management.  If a post- progression re -biopsy is available, continued EGFR 
mutation status as well as emergence of the T790M resistance mutation will be determined. 
2.   Each specimen  will be evaluated for MET amplification. 
3.  Given sufficient tumor specimen, each sample will be evaluated in the following priority 
order for a) for EGFR IHC expression using the established H- score system, b) the 
presence of PI3K mutations (particularly exon 20) and c) tumor RNA expression levels of EGFR and MET amplification as determined through Response Genetics Inc.  
 In post -progression tumor specimens*  
 If a biopsy was conducted at the time of progression on the prior EGFR inhibitor therapy 
(presumably erlotinib), then the following will be cond ucted in available archival specimens:  
 1. MET copy num ber abnormalities/amplification by [CONTACT_4656].  
 2. IHC evaluation of HGF as a paracrine or autocrine stimulator.  
  
*These assays will also be performed in the original diagnostic specimen for patients who have a complete or near complete response to therapy  
 Analysis of serial p lasma specimens 
 1) A principle goal for analysis of serial patient plasma will be to quantitate baseline levels 
and treatment-induced changes in the MET ligand HGF.  Additionally, through multiplex analysis, ErbB family ligands, including amphiregulin, epi[INVESTIGATOR_13358], EGFR and TGF-alpha will be evaluated.  
  2) Patient plasma will be monitored for the presence of the T790M EGFR mutation in circulating cell -free tumor DNA using previously established techniques (Mack ref).  Detection 
of the original activating mutation (e.g. E19del or L858R) will also be performed.  The ratio of 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
70 mutant DNA (EGFR E19del, L858R and T790M) to wild- type DNA detectable in plasma will be

detection of EGFR mutations in peripheral circulation concomitant with decreased tumor burden.  Progression would be associated with increased levels, potentially including emergence of the T790M mutation.

Version Date: January 24, [ADDRESS_687051] – Solid Tumors  
 For the purposes of this study, patients should be re- evaluated for response after cycle 1 (4 
weeks) and then every 2 cycles (8  weeks).  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans 
should also be obtained at least 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.  Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new inter national criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) ( Eisenhauer, Therasse et al. 2009 ).  Changes in the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_687052] treatment with XL184 ( cabozantinib ) and erlotinib. 
 
Evaluable for objective response.  P atients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline and have received at least one dose of therapy will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below.   
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_687053] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_687054] 
x-ray or as >[ADDRESS_687055] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_687056] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), ar e considered as non -measurable.  
 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
76  ‘Cys tic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions sho uld be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 
11.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging- based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defi ned and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, [ADDRESS_687057] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body 
scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow- up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET- CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET- CT is of identic al diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement .  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the nex t.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_13192], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  The utiliza tion of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete respo nse (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
Cytology, Histology  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, wh ere known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, [ADDRESS_687058] of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG- PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at fo llow-up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG- PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at  follow -up corresponds to a pre- existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively 
described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]- specific medical literature for the 
indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
11.1.4 Response Criteria  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
79  
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non- target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33954], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal 
Investigator).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

11.1.5 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented .  
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.   
 
11.1.6 Progression- Free Survival  
 Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.

response, the study will continue enrollment to the final sample size of 37 subjects.  If 4 or 
more of the 37 patients respond, the trial will be regarded as indicating adequate activity in 
tumors with EGFR -mutations, providing other factors, such as toxicity and time to 
progression, also appear favorable.  The probability of indicating activity by [CONTACT_528941] 0.10 if the underlying response rate is 5%, and it is at least 0.90 if the underlying 
response rate is 20%.   
 13.3 Analysis of Secondary En dpoints  
 
1. Studies on targeted agents in a refractory patient population presents unique challenges in design: (1) publications from 1975 [Band and Kocandrle, 1975] and as recent as June 2011 [Tourneau, et al, abstract #2603, ASCO 2011] suggest that therapy should not 
necessarily  be stopped upon documented progression if the tumor growth is still showing 
signs of reduction from pre -treatment values [Band and Kocandrle, 1975]. (2) responses 
are expected to be rare due to the largely cytostatic nature of the ag ents, (3) historical 
benchmarks for PFS have limited utility in small studies in a heterogeneously and heavily pre-treated patient population and also due to the unknown impact of changes 
implemented as part of the new RECIST 1.1 criteria [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_528909], et al, a bstract #2563, ASCO 
2011] and current scanning technology and schedules ; (4) the effect of patient selection 
in referral cancer centers raises questions about single arm PFS results given variability of tumor growth rates, and (5) the limited patient popul ation due to mutation specific 
selection precludes using designs employed in the large r randomized Phase II lung cancer 
studies in the consortium.  These challenges highlight the need for considering novel approaches to evaluating this drug combination in this setting.  
 
To address the se multiple  concerns, we will attempt to obtain a tumor growth estimate  for 
each patient’s disease on the last erlotinib -based therapy . As patients will “fail” treatment 
on prior EGFR TKI, we will be usually be able to obtain at least two scans on the prior treatment to estimate the tumor growth rate, which will be estimated using an exponential growth model, providing a straight -forward estimate of the tumor doubling times. 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, [ADDRESS_687066] 30% from the observed  tumor growth rate  during the prior TKI 
treatment, using each patient as  their own control. This information will also be 
considered, along with toxicity and tolerability in both the interim and final analysis.   
 
Patients will come off study after progression, unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021], the tumor doubling time continues to be more than 15% longer than the previous growth rate, and it is considered the best option for the patient.  [Tumor doubling time in the presence of multiple lesions will be taken as the median tumor doubling time when each tumor is considered independently].   
 
2. Additional secondary endpoints will include the type, severity (by [CONTACT_4652]), time 
of onset, duration, and outcome of toxicities, as  well as progression -free survival rates  
and correlative tumor assays. Toxicity will be graded according to the  NCI CTCAE 
version 4.0. Demographic and baseline clinical information will be  collected. All 
radiographic responses will be evaluated by [CONTACT_528942]. Survival and time to treatment failure will be  summarized with 
Kaplan -Meier plots.  Subset analysis by [CONTACT_365357][INVESTIGATOR_014], and prior erlotinib 
sensitivity will be evaluated.  
 
3. Analysis of Correlative Endpoints: Because of the limited sample size inherent to 
phase II studies, the analysis of secondary endpoints is primarily exploratory. Standard 
descriptive methods will be used to summarize the baseline levels and the changes 
from baseline (i.e. after treatment) which will allow us to examine whether observed 
patterns are consistent with  hypot hesized patterns. For example, t he role of various 
EGFR  mutations and other correlatives (e.g. MET amplification, VEGF and HGF 
levels) will also be considered . If the combination is not found to have sufficient 
activity,  these patterns may help explain the  lack of activity. If sufficient activity is 
found, then patients who experience an objective response will be compared to those  
who did not in terms of these correlates. Estimates of variation will also prove  useful 
for future clinical research on this re gimen. Formal testing of these  comparisons is not 
planned. All analysis will clearly document the exploratory nature of  these studies, 
although no attempt will be made to adjust for multiple  comparisons inherent in 
correlative studies.  
 13.4 For phase 2 protocols only: Reporting and Exclusions  
 
13.4.1 Evaluation of Toxicity  
 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, [ADDRESS_687067] treatment with  XL184 
(cabozantinib)  and erlotinib. NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0 
(CTCAE) will be used.  Unacceptable toxicity will be defined as any treatment -related (possible 
or higher attribution) toxicity that results in a >[ADDRESS_687068] 20, or 20% thereafter, the study will hold for review with the PI, the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee and the NCI regarding treatment modification or study termination. 
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_687069] be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partia l response, 3) stable disease, 4) 
progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).    All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the exception of those who received no study medication) will  be included in the main analysis outcomes.   All patients will be 
summarized with regard to tumor response, time to progression, and toxicity.  Patients in 
response categories 4- 9 will be considered  treatment failure s (i.e. classified with disease 
progression for the purpose of calculating response rates  and disease control rates ).  Thus, an 
incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  
 
 14. CCCP POLICIES FOR MONITORING CONSORTIUM TRIALS  
 
The protocol principal investigator (PI) is responsible for monitoring the conduct and progress of this Phase I I trial, including the ongoing review of accrual, data and 
toxicities, as well as the accumulation of reported adverse events from other trials testing the same drug(s).  The participating clinicians and their designees are responsible for timely submission  of adverse event reports (see Section 7.0) and case report forms.  The 
Data Coordinating Center for the CCCP Consortium is responsible for providing the PI [INVESTIGATOR_528910] a timely fashion.   Although the PI [INVESTIGATOR_528911], it is the Data Coordinating Center of the CCCP that distributes all submitted SAE reports to the appropr iate individuals, including the local protocol principal investigators, at each of the 
participating institutions.   
 
The Data Coordinating Center posts a summary (accrual, toxicities, and responses) of each CCCP initiated trial on the CCCP website.  In th is way, each PI [INVESTIGATOR_25499] -to-
date information on the status of his or her trial.  In consultation with the collaborating statistician, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_36417]:  
 (a) for Phase I trials, all dose limiting toxicities and decisions regarding dose 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
87 escalation, expansion, as well as decisions to terminate escalation, and  
(b) for Phase II trials, the toxicities and therapeutic endpoints referred to in the statistical plan.  
 The Data Coordinating Committee meets monthly to review data management and data quality issues – completeness of data submissions as well as accuracy in terms of built -in, 
computerized logic checks.  Any issues identified and the corrective plans are presented to the Internal Committee and at the next CCCP teleconference meet ing for review and 
approval. 
 
Oversight Oversight of the conduct of CCCP trials occurs at several levels:  
 
1. The Data Coordinating Center for the CCCP flags all trials that are approaching a decision in terms of toxicity (for both Phase I and Phase II trials) or responses (for Phase II trials).  Decisions are made by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_528912] (U01 Cooperative Agreement or N01 Contract, as appropriate) or his or her des ignee, 
and are communicated to the participating centers by [CONTACT_431342]. At the monthly teleconferences, the accrual of each open protocol is reviewed.  
 
2. For CTEP sponsored Phase I trials, data are reported to the NCI -designated 
clinic al trials monitoring service (CTMS) which will audit patients’ records on 
each protocol – at each CCCP institution; this audit is initiated by [CONTACT_472].  For all 
other CCCP trials, the CCCP will contract with Theradex to audit patient records at each CCCP inst itution. 
 3. An independent CCCP DSMC will review CCCP trials every [ADDRESS_687070] of 3 voting members (2 medical oncologists or hematologists involved in Phase I/II cancer clinical trials but not participating in CCCP studies, and a statist ician) and a non- voting CCCP statistician.   
 
a. DSMC meetings will take place twice a year.  Addition al meetings will be 
convened if necessary.  
b. This DSMC will review each CCCP trial in terms of accrual, toxicity/safety, and adherence to trial design, audit results, and likelihood of successful 
completion.   
c. The DSMC will report to the CCCP leadership.

Responsibility of the Protocol Chair  
• The Protocol Chair will be the single liaison with the CTEP Protocol and Information Office (PIO).  The Protocol Chair is responsible for the coordination, development, submission, and approval of the protocol as well as its subsequent amendments.  The protocol must not be rewritten or modified by [CONTACT_36475].  There will  be only one version of the protocol, and each participating institution will use 
that document.  The Protocol Chair is responsible for assuring that all participating institutions are using the correct version of the protocol. 
• The Protocol Chair is respon sible for the overall conduct of the study at all participating 
institutions and for monitoring its progress.  All reporting requirements to CTEP are the responsibility of the Protocol Chair.  
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the timely review of Adve rse Events (AE) to assure 
safety of the patients.  
• The Protocol Chair will be responsible for the review of and timely submission of data for study analysis. 
 
Responsibilities of the Coordinating Center 
• Each participating institution will have an appropriat e assurance on file with the Office 
for Human Research Protection (OHRP), NIH.   The Coordinating Center is responsible 
for assuring that each participating institution has an OHRP assurance and must maintain copi[INVESTIGATOR_36419].  
• Prior to the activation of the protocol at each participating institution, an OHRP form 310 
(documentation of IRB approval) must be submitted to the CTEP PIO. 
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for central patient registration.  The Coordinating 
Center is responsible for assuring that IRB approval has been obtained at each participating site prior to the first patient registration from that site.  
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for the preparation of all submitted data for review by [CONTACT_36476].  
• The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of AE reports.  There are two options for AE reporting: (1) participating institutions may report directly to CTEP with a copy to the Coordinating Center, or (2) participating institutions report to the Coordinating Center who in turn report to CTEP.  The Coordinating Center will submit AE reports to the Protocol Chair for timely review.  
• Audits may be accomplished in one of two ways:  (1) source documents and research 
records for selected p atients are brought from participating sites to the Coordinating 
Center for audit, or (2) selected patient records may be audited on- site at participating 
sites.  If the NCI chooses to have an audit at the Coordinating Center, then the 
Coordinating Center is responsible for having all source documents, research records, all IRB approval documents, NCI Drug Accountability Record forms, patient registration lists, response assessments scans, x -rays, etc. available for the audit.  
Inclusion of Multicenter Guidelines in the Protocol 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
92 • The protocol must include the following minimum information:   The title page must include the name [CONTACT_372385], telephone number and e- mail address of the responsible investigator at each  
participating institution.  
 The Coordinating Center must be designated on the title page. 
 Central registration of patients is required.  The procedures for registration must be stated in the protocol.  
 Data collection forms should be of a common format.  Sample forms should be submitted with the protocol.  The frequency and timing of data submission forms to the Coordinating Center should be stated. 
 Describe how AEs will be reported from the participating institutions, either directly to CTEP or through the Coordinating Center. 
 Describe how Safety Reports and Action Letters from CTEP will be distributed to participating institutions.  
 
Agent Ordering 
• Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD-supplied investigational agents directly from CTEP.  Investigational agents may be ordered by a participating site only after the initial IRB approval for the site has bee n 
forwarded by [CONTACT_36477].

93 APPENDIX C  INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE DRUG INTERACTIONS  
 Information on Possible Interactions with Other Agents for Patients and Their Caregivers and Non- Study Healthcare Team  
 The patient __________________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the experimental agent XL184 (cabozantinib) and erlotinib .  This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_201439].  This form is addressed to the patient, but includes important information for others who care for this patient.   XL184 (cabozantinib and erlotinib interact with many drugs that are processed by [CONTACT_6813].  Because of this, it is very important to tell your study doctors about all of your medicine before you start this study.  It is also very important to tell them if you stop taking any regular medicine, or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study.  When you talk about your medicine with your study doctor, include medicine you buy without a prescription at the drug store (over -the-counter remedy), or herbal supplements such as St. John’s wort.  
 Many health care prescribers can write prescriptions.  You must also tell your other prescribers (doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practitioners) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. Bring this paper with you and keep the attached information card in your wallet .  These are 
the things that you and they need to know:  
 
XL184 (cabozantinib) and erlotinib interact with (a) certain specific enzyme(s) in your liver.  
• The enzyme(s) in question is  CYP3A4 .  This enzyme breaks down XL184 (cabozantinib) 
and erlotinib, gradually reducing the level of the active drug in your system.    
• Other medicines may affect the activity of the enzyme.  XL184 (cabozantinib) and erlotinib 
must b e used very carefully with these medicines, or you may need to switch to alternate 
medications.  
o Substances that increase the enzyme’s activity (“inducers”) could reduce the effectiveness of the drug, while substances that decrease the enzyme’s activity (“inhibitors”) could result in high levels of the active drug, increasing the chance of harmful side effects.  
• You and healthcare providers who prescribe drugs for you must be careful about adding or 
removing any drug in this category.  
• Before you start the study, your study doctor will work with your regular prescriber to 
switch any medicines that are considered “strong inducers of CYP3A4 .” 
• Your prescribers should look at this web site 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/ table.aspx  or consult a medical reference to see 
if any medicine they want to prescribe is on a list of drugs to avoid.   
• Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs have a brand name [CONTACT_159964]—it’s 
usually big and catches your eye.  They also have a generic name—it’s usually small and located above or below the brand name, and printed in the ingredient list.  Find the generic name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] d etermine, with the pharmacist’s help, whether there could be an 
adverse interaction.   
• Be careful:  
o If you take acetaminophen regularly:  You should not take more than 4 grams a 
NCI Protocol #: 9303 
Consortium Protocol # PhII-125 Version Date: January 24, 2014  
94 day if you are an adult or 2.4 grams a day if you are older than 65 years of age.  Read labels carefully!  Acetaminophen is an ingredient in many medicines for pain, flu, and cold. 
o If you drink gra pefruit juice or eat grapefruit or Seville oranges:  Avoid these until 
the study is over.  
o If you take herbal medicine regularly:  You should not take St. John’s wort while you are taking XL184 (cabozantinib and erlotinib). 
 Other medicines can be a problem with your study drugs.   
• You should check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to use an over-the-counter medicine or herbal supplement.  
 
• Your regular prescriber should check a medical reference or call your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine for you.  Your study doctor’s name [CONTACT_832]

INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE DRUG INTERACTIONS  
You are enrolled on a clinical trial using the experimental agent XL184 
(cabozantinib)  and erlotinib .  This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_138768].  XL184 (cabozantinib)  and erlotnib interact with drugs that are 
processed by [CONTACT_6813].  Because of this, it is very important to:  
 Tell your doctors if you stop taking regular medicine or if you 
start taking a new medicine.  
 Tell all of your prescribers (doctor, physicians’ assistant, nurse 
practitioner, pharmacist) that you are taking part in a clinical 
trial.  
 Check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to use an over -the-counter medicine or herbal supplement.  
 
  
 XL184 (cabozantinib)   and erlotinib interact with a specific liver 
enzyme called CYP3A4, and must be used very carefully with other 
medicines that interact with this enzyme.

99 APPENDIX G  CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
Collection, processing and shipment 
 • Cryovials (1.5 – 2 mL size) must be labeled with  the protocol number ( PhII -125), Consortium 
patient ID, patient’s initials, date of specimen collection, and specimen type.   • Collect ~8 mL whole blood in a purple top (EDTA) tube.   • Immediately invert tube (gently) 8 – 10 times. This reduces the possibility of clot formation.  
 • Place tube on wet ice or refrigerate until centrifugation.  
 • Within 2 hours of blood draw, centrifuge sample at 800 x G for 10 minutes .  
 • Immediately after centrifuging, transfer plasma in 1 mL aliquots to 4 labeled cryovials .  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_528914].  
• Leave a small amount of plasma (~ .5 cm) above the buffy coat layer.  
 • After removing plasma, transfer buffy coat to 1 labeled cryovial.  
• The buffy layer is the off- white layer between the p lasma and the red blood cells.  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_170702] a circular motion to obtain as many buffy coat cells as possible.  
• Contamination of the buffy coat with red blood cells is expected and not a concern. There is no need to further purify the white blood cell s with a Ficol separation.  
 • Snap -freeze cryovials in liquid nitrogen (if available).  
 • Store cryovials in a - 70° C freezer until shipped.  
 Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_528915], the Specimen Submission Form (please email [EMAIL_593] for a copy of the form) should be faxed to the Statistical Center at the City of Hope AND the Mack lab ([PHONE_10957]).   The frozen specimens (along with completed Specimen Submission Forms) should be shipped on dry ice by [CONTACT_528943]:

101 APPENDIX H  GUIDELINES FOR TISSUE BIOPSIES  
   Definitions  
• Invasive biopsies: accessing thorax, liver, or soft tissue or deep nodes within the abdomen 
 • Minimally invasive biopsies(and thoracentesis/paracentesis) : superficial nodes, 
cutaneous or superficial lesions, bone biopsies, abdominal ascites or pleural effusions (when collection occurs for patient management)  
Collection Windows  
• Invasive biopsies: All invasive biopsies should be completed [ADDRESS_687078] dose of cabozantinib if possible due to the half life of the drug. 
 • Minimally invasive b iopsies(and thoracentesis/paracentesis) : Minimally invasive 
biopsies are allowed at any time prior to first dose and while the subject is on 
cabozantinib treatment, providing that attention is given to potential effects of 
cabozantinib on wound healing, fistula formation or perforations. No tumors continguous with the esophagus or trachea should be accessed while on cabozantinib treatment"

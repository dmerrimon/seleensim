 STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Title: A Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, sequential parallel 
comparison design (SPCD) study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of AVP -786 (deuterated 
[d6]-dextromethorphan hydrobromide  [d6-DM] /quinidine sulfate  [Q]) for the treatment of agitation in 
patients with dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.  
Study Objectives  
The objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of AVP-786 compared to 
placebo, for the treatment of agitation in patients with dementia of  the Alzheimer’s type.   
Study Population  
Number of Patients :  Approximately 380 patients will be enrolled at approximately 60 centers in North 
America. 
Condition/Disease :  Patients  with agitation secondary to dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.  The diagnosis 
of probable Alzheimer’s disease will be based on  the ‘2011 Diagnostic Guidelines for Alzheimer’s 
Disease’ issued by [CONTACT_477878] (NIA) -Alzheimer’s Association (AA) workgroups.1  
Diagnosis of agitation will be based on t he provisional consensus definition of agitation in patients with 
cognitive disorders  developed by [CONTACT_477879] (IPA) Agitation  Definition 
Work Group.2   
Key Inclusion Criteria :  Patie nts with clinically significant, moderate/severe agitation at the time of 
screening and for at least 2 week s prior to randomization, that interferes with daily routine and for which 
a prescription medication is indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  A Clinical Global Impression of 
Severity of Illness scale for Agitation (CGI S-Agitation ) score of ≥ 4 (moderately ill) at screening and 
baseline is required for study participation.  Eligible patients must have a reliable caregiver who is able 
and willing to comply with study procedures, including not administering any prohibited medications 
during the course of the study .   
Key Exclusion Criteria:  Patients with dementia predominantly of the non -Alzheimer’s type (e.g., 
vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease, substance-induced de mentia) and 
patients with symptoms of agitation t hat are not secondary to Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., secondary to 
pain, other psychiatric disorder or delirium)  are not eligible . 
A complete list of inclusion/exclusion criteria is presented in Section 4 of the study protocol.  
Study Design  
Structure:  This is a  phase 3 , multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled , SPCD  study  
comprising 2 stages.  A schematic of the study design is presented in  Figure 1. 
Duration: Patients will be enrolled in the study for a pproximately 16 weeks; with up to 4-week screening 
period and 12-week treatment period.   The treatment period is divided equally into 2 stages of 6 weeks 
each, Stage 1 and Stage 2 .

 Study Treatment:  The investigational product  is AVP -786 (deuterated  [d6]-dextromethorphan 
hydrobromide  [d6-DM ; INN:deudextromethorphan ]/quinidine sulfate  [Q]).  Two doses of AVP -786 will 
be evaluated ; d6-DM  28 mg/Q 4.9 mg and d6-DM 18 mg/Q 4.9 mg, hereafter referred to as AVP -786-
28/4.9 and AVP -786-18/4.9, respectively.  
Control :  Placebo  capsules of identical appearance to study medication  will be used as control. 
Randomization/Stratification :  Eligible patients will be rand omized into the study in a  
(active:active:placebo) ratio to receive either AVP -786-28/4.9 capsules, AVP -786-18/4.9 capsules, or 
matching placebo capsules in Stage 1.  The randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_477880]  (NPI) Agitation/Aggression domain score (≤  6 vs. >  6), risk assessment for falls  (norm al/mild  
vs. moderate/severe), and concomitant use of antipsychotic medications (yes vs. n o).    
Dose Regimen : Eligible patients  will be randomly assigned at the Baseline visit to receive AVP -786 or 
matching placebo capsules.  Study medication will be admin istered orally twice daily (BID, 1 capsule in 
the morning and 1 capsule in the evening approximately 12 hours apart)  throughout the study.  
Stage 1  
• Patients randomized to receive AVP -786-28/4.9 will start with AVP -786-18/4.[ADDRESS_613071] 7  days of the study .  From Day 8, patients will 
receive AVP -786-18/4.9 BID for 14 days.  From Day 22, patients will receive AVP -786-28/4.9 BID 
for the  remaining 3-week duration of Stage 1 .  
• Patients randomized to receive AVP -786-18/4.9 will start with AVP -786-18/4.[ADDRESS_613072] 7 days of the study.  From Day 8, patients will 
receive AVP -786-18/4.9 BID for the remaining 5-week duration of Stage 1 . 
• Patients randomized to receive placebo will be dosed with placebo BID during Stage 1.  
Stage 2:  
Patients  who complete Stage 1 are eligible to participate in Stage 2 of the study.  In Stage 2, patients will 
be assigned to study  treatment as follows:  
• Patients who received AVP-786 in Stage 1 will continue to receive the same dose of AVP -786 BID 
(either AVP -786-18/4.9 or AVP -786-28/4.9 ) for the entire 6 -week duration of Stage  2. 
• Patients who received placebo in Stage 1 will be further stratified into two sub -groups (“responders” 
and “non-responders”) on Visit 4 (Day 43) based on their treatment response.  Patients will be 
consi dered “responders” if their CGIS- Agitation score is ≤ 3 at Visit 4 ( Day 43) and their NPI  
[INVESTIGATOR_100887]/Aggression d omain score has decreased by ≥ 25% from baseline.   Patients who do not meet 
these criteria will be considered “non -responders”.  Patients within e ach placebo sub-group will be re -
randomized in a   (active:active:placebo) ratio to receive either AVP -786-18/4.9, AVP -786-
28/4.9 capsules, or matching placebo capsules. 
o Patients who are re-randomized to placebo will continue to receive placebo BID for the entire 
6-week duration of Stage 2.

 Pregnancy tests will be conducted  for females o f childbearing potential . 
General Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses  
Analysis Populations  
Three analysis populations will be used ; modified intent -to-treat (m ITT), intent-to-treat (ITT), and safety.  
The mITT population includes all patients randomi zed in the study who had at least one post -baseline 
efficacy assessment, and will be used for all analyses of efficacy.  Patients in the m ITT population will be 
included in the treatment group to which they were randomized regardless of treatment received.   The 
ITT population includes all randomized patients in the study, and will be used for exploratory efficacy 
analyses.   The safety population includes all patients  who received study treatment, and will be used for 
all analyses of safety .  Patients will b e included in the treatment group based on the actual treatment 
received . 
Efficacy Analyses   
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the SPCD method.  The primary efficacy endpoint of the 
study is the change from Baseline to Week 6  (Day 43, Stage 1)  and from Week 6 to Week 12 (Day 85, 
Stage 2) in the composite CMAI score s.  A weighted test statistics combining treatment effects from 
Stage [ADDRESS_613075] in each stage will be estimated by [CONTACT_2329] a  likelihood -
based linear mixed effects mode l repeated measures (MMRM)  on observed data .  Data from Stage [ADDRESS_613076].   Appropriate procedures to control t ype I error will be implemented  and the details will be 
provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .    
Secondary efficacy endpoints include chan ge from Baseline to Week 6 (Day 43, Stage 1)  and from 
Week 6 to Week 12  (Day 85, Stage 2) for the following efficacy measures: mADCS -CGIC -Agitation, 
NPI-Agitation/Aggression domain score and Caregiver Distress  score, NPI-Aberrant Motor Behavior  
domain,  ZBI , NPI-Irritability/Lability domain, PGIC, DEMQOL , CSDD, RUD, total NPI , CGIS -
Agitation, ADCS -CGIC -Overall,  ADAS -cog; and change from Baseline to Week 12 for GMHR .   
Safety Analyses  
Safety measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_37325] 1, Stage 2, and the 2 stages combined.  
Sample Size Calculation  
Power calculations were performed assuming a bivariate normal distribution for the primary efficacy 
endpoint with AVP -786-28/4.9 (high dose) versus  placebo.

 3 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a  phase 3 , multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, SPCD study  of 12-week 
treatment duration.   The treatment period is divided equally into 2 stages of 6 weeks each, Stage 1 and 
Stage 2.  
Sequence  Screening  Stage 1 Stage  2 
Study Day  Day -28 to -1 Day 1 to 42  Day 43 to 85 
 
There will be 8 scheduled clinic visits including a screening visit, and 2 safety follow-up phone visits in 
this study.  Patients  will attend clinic visits at Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and on Days 8 
(Visit  2/Week  1), 15 (Visit 2.1/Week 2), 22 (Visit 3/ Week 3) , 43 (Visit 4/Week  6), 64 (Visit 5/Week 9), 
and 85 (Visit  6/Week  12).  Safety follow -up phone calls will be made on Days 29 (Week 4) and 
71 (Week  10).  A schematic of the study design is depi[INVESTIGATOR_90850] 1. 
Approximately 380 patients will be enrolled at approximately 60 centers in North America.    
Eligible patients  will be randomly assigned at the Baseline visit to receive AVP -786 or matching placebo.  
Study medication will be administered orally twice daily from Day 1 through Day 85.  Patients  (or 
caregivers)  will self -admi nister study medication on all study days  except on the clinic -visit days  when 
patients will be administered their morning dose of study medication at the clinic in the presence of site 
personnel, regardless of the time of day.   Screening will occur within  4 weeks prior to randomization.   
Stage 1  
Following screening procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible patients will 
be randomized into the stud y in a  (active:active:placebo) ratio to receive either AVP-786-28/4.9 
capsules, AVP -786-18/4.9 capsules, or matching placebo capsules.  The randomization will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_183245]  [INVESTIGATOR_100887]/Aggression domain score (≤  6 vs. > 6) , risk assessment for falls (normal /mild  vs. 
moderate/severe), and concomitant use of antipsychotic  medications  (yes vs. no) .  Study medication 
(active or placebo) will be administered orally BID (1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule i n the evening 
approximately 12 hours apart) throughout the treatment period.  
• Patients randomized to receive AVP -786-28/4.9 will start with AVP -786-18/4.[ADDRESS_613081] 7 days of the study.  From Day 8, patients will receive AVP -786-18/4.9 BID for 14 days.  From Day  22, patients will receive AVP -786-28/4.9 BID 
for the remaining 3-week  duration of Stage 1 .  
• Patients randomized to receive AVP -786-18/4.9 will start with AVP -786-18/4.[ADDRESS_613082] 7  days of the study.  From Day 8, patients will 
receive AVP -786-18/4.9 BID for the remaining 5-week duration of Stage 1 . 
• Patients randomized to receive placebo will be dosed with placebo BID during Stage 1 .

 Stage  2: 
Patients who complete Stage 1 are eligible to participate in the 6 -week Stage 2 of the study.  In Stage 2, 
patients will be assigned to study treatment as follows:  
• Patients who received AVP-786 in Stage 1 will continue to receive  the same dose of AVP -786 BID 
(either AVP -786-28/4.9 or AVP -786-18/4.9 ) for the entire 6 -week duration of Stage  2. 
• Patients who received placebo in Stage 1 will be further stratified into two sub -groups (“responders” 
and “non-responders”) on Visit 4 (Day 43 ) based on their treatment response.  Patients will be 
consi dered “responders” if  
 
 will be considered “non -responders”.   Patients within each placebo sub -group will be 
re-randomized in a   (active:active:placebo) ratio to receive either AVP -786-28/4.9 capsules , 
AVP -786-18/4.9 capsules, or matching placebo capsules. 
o Patients who are re-randomized to placebo will continue to rece ive placebo BID for the entire 
6-week duration of Stage 2. 
o Patients who are re- randomized to AVP -786-28/4.9 will receive AVP -786-18/4.[ADDRESS_613083] 7 days of Stage 2 (Days 43-49).  From 
Day 50, patients will receive AVP -786- 18/4.9 BID for 14 days (Days 50 -63).   From Day 64, 
patients will receive AVP -786-28/4.9 BID for the remaining 3 weeks of the study.  
o Patients who are re- randomized to AVP -786-18/4.9 will receive AVP -786-18/4.[ADDRESS_613084] 7 days of Stage 2 (Days 43 -49).  From 
Day 50, patients will receive AVP -786-18/4.[ADDRESS_613085] present with clinically 
meaningful , moderate/sever e agitation  secondary to AD.  
The diagnosis of probable AD will be based on the ‘2011 Diagnostic Guidelines for Alzheimer’s Disease’  
issued by [CONTACT_45429] (NIA) -Alzheimer’s Association (AA) workgroups.1  These new 
criteria were developed based  on the review of the NINC DS–ADRDA criteria.22  Neither AD nor 
agitatio n should be explainable  by [CONTACT_477883], substance use and /or major psychiatric disorders.  
The provisional consensus definition of agitation in patients with cognitive disorders  developed by t he 
Agitation Definition Work Group (ADWG) from the International Ps ychogeriatric Association (IPA)2, 
will be used  for selecting study patients.   This proposed definition is limited to patients with cognitive 
impairment and requires:  (a) evidence of emotional distress; (b) one of 3  observable types of behaviors -
excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, or physical aggression; (c) that the behavior causes excess 
disability; and (d) that the behaviors cannot be solely attributable to a suboptimal care environment or 
other disorder such as a psychiatric illness, a medical illness, or effects of a substance.  
Eligible patients must have agitation (persistent or frequen tly recurrent) at the time of study screening and 
for at least [ADDRESS_613086] be severe enough such that 
they interfere with daily routine and cause distress to the patient and caregiver for which a prescript ion 
medication is deemed indicated, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021].  
Agitation will further be assessed  using the CGI S-Agitation  scale (0 -7).  A score of ≥ 4 (moderately ill) at 
screening and baseline are required for study participation.  
Eligible patients are to have otherwise  acceptable and stable general health as required by [CONTACT_17143], and documented by [CONTACT_9870], physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and 
clinical laboratory examinations.  
Eligible patients must have a caregiver who is able and willing to comply with all required study 
procedures, ensuring that the patient attends all study visits and takes the study medication as instructed.  
Caregivers will also be instructed to keep a study diary, to report any changes in patient’s status, including adverse events, standard of care setting (e.g., becoming a resident in an assisted living facility) , 
and to provide their impression and assessment regarding the investigational treatment.  In order to 
qualify as a reliable informant  (i.e., caregiver) capable of assessing changes in the patient’s condition 
during this study, the individual must spend a minimum of 2 hours per day  for 4 days per week with the  
study p atient.  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
1. Males and females 50 to 90 years of age, inclusive at the time of informed consent . 
2. Diagnosis of probable AD according to the 2011 NIA -AA working groups criteria.   Either out-

regardless of the time of day.   For Visits 2 (Day 8) and 2.1 (Day 15), t he morning dose of study 
medication can be administered at home if the visit will occur within 2 hours of dosing; the time of dosing should be noted by [CONTACT_102]/caregiver.  Patients  and caregivers will be instructed that the patient should 
take the study medication  orally with water approximately every 12 hours ± 4 hours (morning and 
evening).  The time the  patient takes each dose of medication should be recorded in the diary card.   
Patient’s  missed doses will be noted in the  electronic case report form  (eCRF). 
All study medication will be supplied and administered in a double -blind manner throughout the entire 
duration of the study.  
5.2 Accountability of Study Supplies 
5.2.1 Receipt of Supplie s 
The investigator is responsible for maintaining an inventory of each shipment of IP received and 
comparing it with the accompanying Drug Accountability Report/Material Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_254316].  The 
investigator will verify the accuracy of the information on the form, sign and date it, and return the form to the sponsor or its representative.  All IP supplied is for use only in this study and should not be used for 
any other purpose.   All blister card  material ID numbers will also be recorded and tracked at the site using 
the Drug Accountability Log.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_613095] of Dispensing  
Accurate recording of all IP dispensing for individual patients will be made in the appropriate section of 
the patient’s eCRF.  This eCRF will contain the following information: (i) patient number to whom the 
drug was dispensed; (ii) the date(s) and quantity of the drug dispensed to the patient ; and (iii)  the blister 
card material ID number  assigned to the patient via IWRS .  
Additionally, the detachable panel of the two-panel label on each blister car d will be removed  and affixed 
to the study medication  Dispensing Log page  at the time of dispensing.   Space is provided on both panels 
of the blister card  label to record patient number, the visit week  and dispensing date.   

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol [ADDRESS_613096] be inventoried on the Drug 
Accountability Log  and returned to the sponsor or its representative, along with a completed and signed 
Drug Accountability Report/Material Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_254316].   If any study medication is lost or damaged, it 
should be indicated on the form.   
5.3 Methods of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
5.3.1 Randomization 
Upon entry into the study ( after ICF is signed  at screening), all patients will be assigned a patient 
number.    
.  This  number is the main identifier for patients. 
Stage 1  
Eligible patients will be randomized to receive AVP -786-28/4.9 capsules, AVP -786-18/4.9  capsules, or 
matching placebo  capsules in a  ratio on Day 1 (Baseline, Stage 1) in a double -blind manner 
according to a randomization scheme devised by [CONTACT_477885].  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_239231] [INVESTIGATOR_100887]/Aggression domain score (≤  6 vs. > 6),  risk 
assessment for falls (normal /mild  vs. moderate/severe ), and concomitant use of antipsychotic medications  
(yes vs. no).  Blocked randomization is used to ensure treatment balance in each stratum.   
Stage 2  
Re-randomization will occ ur for patients who were assigned to placebo in Stage 1.  The patient number 
will not be re -assigned; it will remain the same in both stages of the study.    
• Patients who receive placebo in Stage 1 will be further stratified into two sub -groups (“responders” 
and “non-responders”) based on their treatment responses.  Patients will be considered “responders” 
if  
  Patients who do not meet  will be 
considered “non-responders”.   Patients within each placebo sub -group will be re -randomized in a 
 (active:active:placebo) ratio to receive either AVP -786-18/4.9, AVP -786-28/4.9 capsules, or 
matching placebo capsules.  
• Patients who receive placebo and who drop out early in Stage 1 will also be assigned a re-
randomization treatment  in the same manne r as the other placebo patients .  Their  “responders” and 
“non-responders” status will be based on their treatment responses using measurements at their early 
termination visit.     
• Patients who receive AVP -786 in Stage 1 will not be re -randomized and will continue to receive the 
same dose of AVP -786 BID (either AVP -786-18/4.9 or AVP -786-28/4.9) for the entire 6 -week 
duration of Stage  2.

 Page 42 
 5.3.2 Blinding/Masking  
Blinding will be maintained by [CONTACT_477886] 2 doses of AVP -786 and placebo that are 
identica l in appearance.  The sponsor, patients,  caregivers,  investigators, or other study personnel will not 
be aware of a patient’s treatment assignment.   In the event that it becomes medically necessary to identify 
which treatment a patient has received, the bl ind can be broken .  In that event, the investigator is to 
contact [CONTACT_477887]’s medical monitor  or representative to request the unmasking of a patient .  The I WRS 
manager is not required to be blinded and he or she will have access to the study medicat ion list and the 
randomization code.  
5.4 Patient Compliance 
Patients and caregivers will be instructed to bring any unused study medication and empty blister cards to 
the clinic on Days 8, 15, 22, 43, 64, and 85 (Visits 2 – 6).  For this study, compliance will be defin ed as 
when a patient takes at least 80% of their scheduled doses  (compliance range 80-120%) .  Caregivers will 
be provided with diary cards and will be instructed to record daily the number of capsules taken and the 
time of administration.  Diary cards will be reviewed for compliance and collected on Days 22, 43, 64 , 
and 85 (Visits 3 – 6), or at the time of early study discontinuation.  Patients should bring their Diary Card 
on Day  8 (Visit 2) and Day 15 (Visit 2.1) for compliance review;  the Diary Card will be returned to the 
patient and collected at the next visit.

5.5.2 Rescue Medication for the Symptoms of Agitation 
Patients will be allowed to receive oral lorazepam as rescue medication for the short -term treatment of 
symptoms of agitation if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093].  Lorazepam will be administered in a dose 
up to 1.5  mg/day and not to exceed [ADDRESS_613097] be administered by 
[CONTACT_477871]:  CMAI, NPI, mADCS- CGIC -Agitation , and CGIS -Agitation.  
6.1.1 Cohen- Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) 
The CMAI will be used as the primary efficacy measure in this study.  The CMAI (Appendix 2) is used to 
assess the frequency of manifestations of agitated behaviors in elderly persons.  It consists of 29  agitated 
behaviors  
  
   
.  E ach of 
the 29 items is rated on a 7 -point scale of frequency (1 = never, 2 = less than once a week but still 
occurring, 3  = once or twice a week , 4 = several times a week, 5  = once or twice a day , 6 = several times a 
day, 7  = several times an hour).  The ratings are based on the 2 weeks preceding assessment of CMAI.  
The CMAI (long -form version, Appendix 2) will be assessed at Screening (Day -28 to Day  -1), Baseline  
(Day 1) , Day 8 (Visit 2), Day 15 (Visit 2.1), Day 22 (Visit 3), Day 43  (Visit 4), Day 64 (Visit 5) , and 
Day 85 (Visit 6 ).  The CMAI must  be administered by [CONTACT_477871] . 
6.1.2 Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) 
The NPI  [CONTACT_832] a validated clinical instrument for evaluating psychopathology in a variety of 
disease settings, including dementia.  The NPI [CONTACT_832] a retrospective caregiver -informant interview covering 
12 neuropsychiatric symptom domains : delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, 
depression /dysphoria , anxiety, elation /euphoria , apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, 
aberrant motor behavior, sleep and nighttime behavioral disorders, and appetite/eating disorder s.  The 
scripted NPI [INVESTIGATOR_477852] a compound screening question for each symptom domain, followed by a list of interrogatives about domain-specific behaviors that is administered when a positive response to a screening question is elicited.  Neuropsychiatric manifestations within a domain are collectively rated by [CONTACT_477888] ( 1 to 4) and severity (1 to 3), yielding a composite symptom 
domain score (frequency x severity).   Frequency and severity rating scales have defined anchor points to 
enhance the reliability of caregiver responses.  Caregiver distress is rated for each positive 
neuropsychiatric symptom domain on a scale anchored by [CONTACT_171858] 0 (not distressing at all) to 
5 (extremely distressing).  The NPI [INVESTIGATOR_477853]’s caregiver at Baseline (Day 1) , 
Day 22 (Visit 3), Day 43  (Visit 4), Day 64 (Visit 5), and Day  85 (Visit 6).  The Agitation/Aggression

 domain of  the NPI  [INVESTIGATOR_477854]’s caregiver at  Screening (Day  -28 to Day -1),Day 8 
(Visit 2)  and Day 15 (Visit 2.1 ).  The NPI [INVESTIGATOR_477855] . 
The NPI [INVESTIGATOR_477856] 4 weeks  but can be modified 
according  to the needs of the study .  In this study, the recall period will be 2 weeks for all the  visits  
The NPI [CONTACT_41207]-home version (NPI -NH) will be used for patients from in -patient or assisted living 
facilities.  The questions in the NPI -NH were rephrased for professional caregivers who may not know 
the patients prior to the onset of illness; however, the overall instrument domains and scoring is identical 
to the NPI  [INVESTIGATOR_477857] -NH version .    
The Agitation/Aggression domain in the NPI [INVESTIGATOR_477858] (Day 1), 
Day 22 (Visit 3 ), Day  43 (Visit 4 ), Day 64 (Visit 5), and Day  85 (Visit 6). 
6.1.3 Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness- Agitation (CGIS -
Agitation) 
The CGI S (Appendix 4) is an observer -rated scale that measures illness severity and is one of the most 
widely used brief assessment tools  in psychiatry research.   
The Early Clinical Drug Evaluation Unit (ECDEU) version of the CGIS is the most widely used format  of 
this validated tool, and asks that the clinician rate the patient relative to their past experience with other patients with the same diagnosis, with or without collateral information.  The CGI S has proved to be a 
robust measure of efficacy in many clinical drug trials
26–[ADDRESS_613098] been tested in multiple studies, including patients with dementia, schizophrenia and affective disorders.  Overall, CGI showed high correlation (r:  ~90%) with other 
assessment instruments and it has also shown positive significant relationships and concurrent validity with other clinician’s rating.  I n addition, the scale has good sensitivity to change over time.
32–34 
The CGIS is a 7 -point (1- 7) scale (1  = normal, not at all ill; 7  = among the most extremely ill patients) 
and assesses severity of agitation in this study.  The CGIS-Agitation  will be assessed at Screening (Day -
28 to Da y -1), Baseline (Day 1) , Day 43  (Visit 4), and Day  85 (Visit 6 ).  The CGIS -Agitation must be 
administered by [CONTACT_477871] . 
6.1.4 Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global 
Impression of Change Rating (ADCS- CGIC- Overall ) 
The intent of  the ADCS version of the CGIC (Appendix 5) (herein referred to as ADCS-CGIC-Overall),  
is to provide a means to reliably assess change from a baseline level of global function within the 
timeframe  of a clinical tria l.  Unlike a targeted symptom scale, the ADCS -CGIC-Overall takes into 
account a patient's overall function in the cognitive, behavioral and functional activity domains.  Relying 

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 47 
 on information gathered through a semi -structured interview of the patient and  caregiver, the 
ADCS -CGIC -Overall  focuses on clinician’s observations of change in the patient's cognitive, functional, 
and behavioral performance since the beginning of a trial.  Once the baseline level of severity is 
established, the change score at the follow -up visits is based on information gathered from the patient  and 
caregiver interviews.  The ADCS -CGIC -Overall  is rated as: marked improvement, moderate 
improvement, minimal improvement, no change, minimal worsening, moderate worsening, or marked worsening.   
The baseline ADCS-CGIC -Overall  evaluation will be conducted at the Baseline (Day 1)  visit.  The 
ADCS -CGIC -Overall  will be assessed at  Day 43  (Visit 4) and Day  85 (Visit  6) for change in Overall 
Clinical Status.  At Day 43 (Visit  4), change from the Baseline visit (Day 1)  will be assessed.  At Day 85 
(Visit 6 ), change from Day  43 (Visit 4 ) and change from the Baseline visit (Day 1) will be assessed .  
6.1.5 Modified Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global 
Impression of Change Rating (mADCS-CGIC- Agitation) 
The standard ADCS -CGIC instrument was modified to better assess aspects relevant to studying agitation 
in AD ( mADCS -CGIC -Agitation).  The mADCS -CGIC-Agitation  (Appendix 6) contains questions 
related  to agitation and an assessment of the Clinician’s Impression of Change focused specifically on 
agitation.  It was originally designed for the Citalopram  study for Agitation in Alzheimer’s disease 
(CitAD)35,[ADDRESS_613099] ured agitation interview of both patient  and caregiver .   
The baseline m ADCS-CGIC -Agitation evaluation will be conducted at the Baseline (Day 1) visit.  The 
mADCS -CGIC -Agitation will be assessed at Day 43  (Visit 4) and Day  85 (Visit  6) for change in agitat ion 
syndrome .  At Day 43 (Visit  4), change from the Baseline visit (Day 1) will be assessed.  At Day 85 
(Visit 6), change from Day  43 (Visit 4) and change from the Baseline visit (Day 1) will be assessed.  The 
mADCS -CGIC -Agitation must be administered by [CONTACT_477871]. 
6.1.6 Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) 
The ZBI (Appendix 7) is a [ADDRESS_613100] of patient’s disabilities on the 
caregiver’s life.  It is designed to reflect the burden experienced by [CONTACT_477889].
[ADDRESS_613101] commonly used 
scale for measur ing burden in caregivers’ of patie nts with dementia and also other illnesses.[ADDRESS_613102] high internal-reliability with an estimated Cronbach’s alpha at 0.[ADDRESS_613103] reliability at 0.71.  Validity has been estimated by [CONTACT_477890] a single 
global rating of burden ( r = 0.71).[ADDRESS_613104] (never, rarely, sometimes, quite frequently, or nearly always).  The score ranges from 0 to 88 and is determined by [CONTACT_477891].  Higher scores 
indicate greater caregiver distress.  

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 48 
 The ZBI will be assessed at Baseline (Day 1) , Day 43  (Visit 4), and Day  85 (Visit 6). 
6.1.7 Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI C) 
The PGI C (Appendix 8) is a 7-point (1- 7) scale used to assess treatment response, and it is rated as: very 
much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, or very 
much worse.31 
The PGIC will be assessed and rated by [CONTACT_102]’s caregiver at  Day 43 (Visit 4) and Day  85 (Visit 6) 
and will focus on the patient’s agitation .   
6.1.8 Dementia Quality of Life (DEMQOL)  
The DEMQOL  (Appendix 9) is a scale used to evaluate health related quality of life in patients with 
dementia  and their caregivers.40  There are 2 versions of the DEMQOL, a 28-item version  (rated by 
[CONTACT_4676])  and a 31-item version (DEMQOL-proxy, rated by [CONTACT_84452] ).  Both the 28-item and 31-item 
version are recommended to be used for evaluating patients (and their caregivers) with mild to moderate dementia (MMSE ≥10).  For patients with severe dementia, only the DEMQOL-proxy (administered to caregiver) is used.    
The DEMQOL -proxy (and DEMQOL for patients with M MSE ≥10  at the Baseline visit ) will be assessed 
at Baseline (Day 1) , Day 43  (Visit 4 ), and Day  85 (Visit 6 ). 
6.1.9 Alzheimer’s disease Assessment Scale -Cognitive Subscale  
(ADAS -cog) 
The ADAS (Appendix 10) was designed to evaluate the co gnitive and non-cognitive behavioral 
dysfunction characteristics of patients with AD.41  The cognitive sub-scale (ADAS -cog) consists of 
11 subsets related to memory, praxis, and language.  The ADAS -cog takes about 30 to 45 minutes to 
complete.   
The ADAS -cog will be  assessed at Baseline (Day 1), Day 43 (Visit 4), and Day  85 (Visit 6) for patients 
with an MMSE sco re of ≥ 10  at the Baseline visit. 
6.1.10  Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) 
The CSDD (Appendix 11) was specifically developed to assess signs and symptoms of major depression 
in patients with dementia .42  Because some of these patients may give unreliable reports, the CSDD uses a 
comprehensive interviewing approach that derives information from the patient and the caregiver.  
Information is elicited through two semi -structured interviews; an interview with a caregiver and an 
intervie w with the patient.  The interviews focus on depressive symptoms and signs occurring during the 
week preceding the assessment .  The CSDD takes approximately 20 minutes to administer.  
Each item is rated for severity on a scale of 0 -2 (0  = absent, 1  = mild or intermittent, 2  = severe).  The 
item scores are added.  Scores above 10 indic ate a probable major depression,  scores above 18 indicate a 

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 49 
 definite major depression, and s cores below 6 as a rule are associated with absence of significant 
depressive symptoms.  
The CSDD will be  assessed at Screening  (Day -28 to Day -1), Day 43 (Visit 4 ), and Day  85 (Visit 6). 
6.1.11  Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) 
The RUD (Appendix 12) is used to calculate healthcare costs associated with dementia.43  It evaluates 
dementia patients’ utilization of formal and informal healthcare resources, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477859], living assistance, and time spent by [CONTACT_105]- professional caregivers.  Within the context of 
clinica l trials, the RUD is often used to determine the cost effectiveness of new pharmaceutical 
treatments.44   
The RUD is administered as a semi -structured interview with the patient’s primary caregiver, and 
contains 2  sections; one focusing on caregiver impact (loss of work and leisure time incurred by 
[CONTACT_84452]) and the other focusing on the patient’s use of healthcare resources.  The total healthcare costs 
associated with the patient’s dementia can be estimated by [CONTACT_477892] (e.g., 
hours of caregiver time, visits to doctors, nights in accommodation) by [CONTACT_477893].  
The RUD will be assessed at Baseline (Day 1) , Day 43  (Visit 4), and Day  85 (Visit 6). 
6.1.12  General Medical Health Rating (GMHR)  
The GMHR  (Appendix 13) is a global clinical rating  for medical health , designed to quantify in a single 
number (1 to 4) the severity of general co -morbidity in a patient with dementia.45  A rating of 1 = poor, 2 
= fair, 3 = good and 4 = excellent to very good.    
The GMHR  will be assessed at Screening (Day -28 to Da y -1) and Day 8 5 (Visit 6). 
6.2 Pharmacokinetics  (PK)  
At Day 43 (Visit 4 ) and Day 85 (Visit 6), patients will have a blood sample collected between 0 to 3 
hours after the morning dose of study medication for analysis of  plasma levels of  d6-DM, d6-DM 
metabolite s and Q .  The time when the patient was administered  the dose of study medication and the 
time of the blood draw will be recorded on the eCRF.  Plasma samples will be separated by [CONTACT_477894] -20° C until assayed at the analytical uni t.

 6.3 Safety  
6.3.1 Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  
An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence or unintended change (including physical, 
psychological, or behavioral) from the time ICF is signed , including inter -current illness, which occurs 
during the course of a clinical trial after treatment has started, whether considered related to treatment or 
not.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associa ted with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  Changes associated with normal growth and 
development that do not vary in frequency or magnitude from that ordinarily anticipated clinically are not AEs ( e.g., onset of menstruation occurring at a physiologically appropriate time).  
Clinical AEs should be described by [CONTACT_85333] ( e.g., cold, seasonal 
allergies, instead of “runny nose”) . 
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than specified in the protocol and higher than known therapeutic doses.   It must be reported irrespective of outcome even if 
toxic effects were not observed.  
AEs will be graded on a 3 -point scale and repor ted in detail as indicated on the eCRF: 
 Mild:   easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with  
normal everyday activities  
 Moderate:   sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
 Severe:   incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities  
The relationship of each AE to study medication should be determined by [CONTACT_477895]:  
 Not related :  the event is clearly related to other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the patient  
 Unlikely related :  the event is most likely produced by [CONTACT_244130]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the patient; and does not follow a known response pattern to the study medication  
 Possibl y related :  the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration; and/or  follows a known response pattern to the study  medication; 
but could have been produced by [CONTACT_244130]’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the patient  
 Related :   the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of  drug 
administration; and follows a known response pattern to the study medication ;

 and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_244130]’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the 
patient 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE ) is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening experience (one that places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred, i.e., it does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death)  
3. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is a substantial disruption of a person’s 
ability to conduct normal life functions)  
4. In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, or be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91403], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  
The terms “cancer” and “overdose” are not considered to be SAEs, but if a patient exp eriences cancer  or 
overdose , they are  still reportable  as AEs. 
Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE or an SAE , unless a complication occurs that meets the 
requirements for an AE or SAE , but must be reported on a pregnancy report form.   Women who are 
pregnant or likely to become pregnant are excluded from this study.  In the event a patient becomes 
pregnant during the study, study medication must be discontinued, a pregnancy report form must be 
completed to capture potential drug exposure during pregnancy, and the pregnancy must be reported 
within [ADDRESS_613105] be followed until the outcome of her pregnancy is 
known (i.e., normal delivery, abnormal delivery, spontaneous/voluntary/therapeutic abortion).  The 
pregnancy (i.e., the mother and the fetus) must be followed up through delivery with regard to outcome.  
A pregnancy report  form must also be completed in the event that a female partner of a male patient 
becomes pregnant within [ADDRESS_613106] dose of study medication  or study completion, whichever 
is greater.   
The term ‘severe’ is a measure of intensity; thus a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  For example, 
nausea of several hours duration may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious.

Such preliminary reports will be followed by [CONTACT_477898], which may include copi[INVESTIGATOR_3103], autopsy reports, and other related documents when requested.  
The Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee  (IRB/EC ) will be notified of such an event in writing 
as soon as is practical  in compliance with federal and local regulations . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Procedures to be followed  in the Event of Abnormal Test Values 
Any patients with clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results may be required  by [CONTACT_477899] a repeat test 1 week  later or earlier, if medically indicated.  Clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities may be a basis for exclusion from study entry.  
6.3.2 Physica l and Neurological Examinations 
Physical and neurological examinations  will be performed at Screening  (Day -28 to Day -1), Day  43 
(Visit 4), and Day 85 (Visit 6).  The physical examination will  include assessments of head, eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, lymph nodes, skin, extremities, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and nervous systems.  The neurological  examination will include assessments of mental status, cranial 
nerves, motor system, reflexes, coordination, gait and station, and sensory system.   The physical and 
neurological examinations  should be performed by [CONTACT_419078], whenever possi ble.

 Page 53 
 Physical and neurological examination abnormalities determined by [CONTACT_477900].  
Any clinically significant changes in physical and neurological examination findings from the screening 
examination should be recorded as AEs.  
6.3.3 Vital Signs 
Orthostatic blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) measurements will be performed at all clinic visits.  
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_477860] a patient has rested for at least 5 minutes in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  Each measurement will be taken twice in the same position and recorded .  After the measurement of 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_42430], the patient will stand still for up to 3 minutes and a single measurement of standing BP and HR will be recorded within these 3 minutes of standing.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breaths/minute) and body temperature (ºF ) will be assessed  at all clinic visits.  Weight 
will be recorded at Baseline (Day 1) and Day 85 (Visit 6).  
6.3.4 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The following clinical laboratory assessments are to be performed at Screening  (Day -28 to Day  -1), 
Day 22 (Visit 3), Day  43 (Visit 4), Day 64 (Visit 5), and Day 85 (Visit 6): 
• Blood chemistry (calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, 
carbon dioxide, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], serum creatinine, uric acid, albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [AST/SGOT], alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic pyruv ic 
transaminase [ALT/SGPT], creatine kinase [CK], gamma -glutamyl transferase [GGT], 
triglycerides, total protein, and total cholesterol)

 6.3.5 Pregnancy Tests 
Urine pregnancy tests are to be performed for females of childbearing potential at Screening  (Day -28 to 
Day -1), Baseline (Day  1), Day  43 (Visit 4 ), and  Day 85 (Visit 6). 
All female patients  of childbearing potential should be instructed to use appropriate birth control methods 
for up to [ADDRESS_613110] dose of study medication .  
6.3.6 Electrocardiograms  
A resting 12-lead ECG will be performed at all clinic visits  except on Day 8 (Visit 2).  At Screening, ECG 
will be performed in triplicate.  At Baseline (Day  1) and Day  43 (Visit 4), two ECGs will be performed; 
one prior to study medication dosing and one 2-3 hours after dosing .  ECG equipment will be provided by 
[CONTACT_9251].   ECG data will be recorded at the study center and will include general findings, heart 
rate (beats/minute) QRS complex and PR and QTc intervals (milliseconds).  Results will be prov ided by 
[CONTACT_477901] i nvestigators  within 24  hours.  ECG data will be transferred automatically from 
the central reader into the eCRF monthly.  ECG abnormalities present at Screening will be recorded as 
medical history.  Any changes from the ECG status at Screening  Visit  that are deemed to be clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_477902].   Any clinically significant abnormal ECG 
should be discussed with the study MM and, if necessary be repeated within a 1 -week period.  
6.3.7 Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (S -STS)  
The S-STS (Appendix 14 ) is a prospective scale that assesses treatment -emergent suicidal thoughts and 
behaviors .46  Each item of the S-STS is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = n ot at all; 1 = a little; 
2 = moderate; 3 = very; and 4 = extremely) .  The Sheehan -STS can be analyzed as individual item scores, 
suicidal ideation subscale score, suicidal behavior subscale score, or total score.   For the screening visit, 
the timeframe for the items on the scale will be ‘in the p ast 6 months’ and for all other visits it will be 
‘since last visit’.   
The S-STS will be  assessed  at Screening (Day -28 to Day -1), Baseline (Day 1), Day 8 (Visit 2) , Day 15 
(Visit 2.1), Day 22 (Visit 3), Day 43  (Visit 4), Day 64 (Visit 5), and Day  85 (Vi sit 6).  Any change in the 
S-STS score indicating the presence of suicidality should be evaluated by [CONTACT_477903].  
6.3.8 Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE)  
The MMSE (Appendix 15) is a brief [ADDRESS_613111] to document an individual’s response to treatment.  
The MMSE scale comprises 11 questions or simple tasks concerning orientation, memory, attention, and language to evaluate the patient’s cognitive state.
47  It requires only 5 to 10 minutes for a trained rater to 
administer it. 

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0

standard armchair, walk [ADDRESS_613112] will be performed at Screening (Day -28 to Day -1), Day 43  (Visit 4 ), and Day  85 (Visit 6 ).  
6.3.10  Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS)  
The ESS (Appendix 17) is an 8-item questionnaire  that is used to measure sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_477861] [ADDRESS_613113] people engage in during the day .50  The 
questions are rated on a 4 point s cale (0 to 3) where 0 = would never  doze , 1 = slight chance of dozing, 
2 = moderate chance o f doz ing, and 3 = high chance of dozing.  A total score of 0 to 9 is considered to be 
normal.    
The ESS will be assessed at Baseline (Day 1), Day 43  (Visit 4 ), and Day  85 (Visit 6 ).

7.1 Data Collection 
The sponsor  or designated representative (e.g., CRO) will perform the data management activities in 
accordance with the data management plan (DMP).  The DMP  will outline the systems and procedures to 
be used  in the study . 
Clinical study data will be reported (captured) by [CONTACT_477904].  An eCRF must be 
completed for every patient enrolled in the study.  The eCRF data will be entered by [CONTACT_402546] -site 
personnel and then reviewed for completeness and accuracy and electronically signed by [CONTACT_477905] .  All study -site personnel must use a password -protected user account  to enter, 
review, or correct study data.  Electronic signature [CONTACT_477925] 21 
Part 11.  Passwords will be strictly confidential.  
All eCRF data will be exported  from the electronic data capture (EDC) system and transferred to the 
sponsor  or representative.  The sponsor  or representativ e will also receive electronic transfers of non-
eCRF data such as laboratory data from the central laboratory, ECG data from the central ECG reader,  as 
well as other data from third-party vendors as appropriate.  The electronic data format of all transfers  will 
be agreed upon with the sponsor or representative and documented in the DMP or vendor data transfer requirements document as appropriate.  
The clinical monitoring staff will perform source data verification (SDV) of the data recorded in the EDC 
system  with source documents at the clinical study sites according to the data management plan and 
clinical monitoring plan.  The data will be subjected to consistency and validation checks within the EDC system with supplemental data reviews performed outside of the EDC system.   
Medical h istory and adverse events will be coded using a current version of Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and concomitant medications using a current version of the WHO Drug Dictionary.  The sponsor or represent ative will perform a medical safety review of the coding.  
Completed eCRF images with a date- and time -stamped electronic audit trail indicating the user, the data 
entered, and any reason for change (if applicable) will be archived at the investigator’s site and at the sponsor’s site.

The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from Baseline to Week 6 ( Day 43, Stage 1)  and from Week 6 
to Week 12 (Day 85, Stage 2) in the composite CMAI scores.  The pr imary efficacy analysis will be 
based on SPCD method using a weighted test statistics  combining treatment effects from Stage [ADDRESS_613126] in each stage will be estimated by [CONTACT_2329] a  likelihood -based linear mixed 
effects model repeated measures (MMRM)  on observed data .  The model will include fixed effects f or 
treatment,  visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, baseline-by -visit interaction  and baseline covariates which 
include baseline value and other randomization stratification factors.   An unstructured covariance model 
will be used .  Analyses with missing v alues imputed by [CONTACT_176261] ( LOCF ) and 
Multiple Imputation (MI) may be performed as sensitivity analyses.  
The 2 primary comparisons are AVP- 786-28/4.9 vs. placebo  and AVP -786-18/4.9 vs. p lacebo.  An 
appropriate multiple comparison procedure will be used to control the overall type I error at 2-sided α = 
0.05.   
8.3.3 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include change from B aseline to Week 6 (Day 43, Stage 1) and from

The ICF  will follow the principles outlined in the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki .  For e ach 
patient found to be eligible for the study, informed consent  will be obtained from the patient (if the patient 
is capable in the judgment of the investigator to provide informed consent) or the authorized 
representative.  For patients that are not capable of providing informed consent, but are capable of 
providing assent,  the patient will be asked to provide assent.  If the patient is not capable of providing 
assent, the investigator will document the reasons why and maintain that documentation with the other 
informed consent documents.  The patient’s caregiver will also be asked to provide informed consent as 
they will be providing data on themselves and the patient, as well as, being responsible for ensuring compliance from the patient between study visits.  
The patient s and/or patient ’s authorized representative and the caregiver  will be properly informed of the 
purpose of the study.  The patients and/or patient ’s authorized representative and the caregiver  will be 
alerted to any anticipated AE that may be encountered with the study medication.  A signed ICF will be 
obtained from all patients and/or patient’s authorized representative and the caregiver  prior to patient 
entry into this study.  Patients and/or patient’s authorized representative and the caregiver  will be 
provided with a copy of their signed ICF . 
9.3 Patient’s  Diar y Card 
The patient’s Diary Card  will be reviewed by [CONTACT_477907] .  The study personnel are 
responsible for (i) ensuring that patients  and/or caregivers are properly collecting data and recording it 
into the diaries; and (ii) transcribing the diary recordings into the eCRF.  The diary will be collected at all 
study visits after baseline except Visit 2 (Day 8)  and Visit 2.1 (Day 15),  wherein the diary will be

4.6.3  The investigator/institution and/or a pharmacist or other appropriate
individual, who is designated by [CONTACT_093]/institution, should maintain
records of the product's delivery to the trial site, the inventory at the site, the use
by [CONTACT_6992], and the return to the sponsor or alternative disposition of unused
product(s).  These records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers,
expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659] (if applicable), and the unique code numbers assigned to the
investigational product(s) and trial subjects. Investigators should maintain records
that document adequately that the subjects were provided the doses specified by
[CONTACT_477914](s) received from the sponsor.
4.6.[ADDRESS_613150](s) should be stored as specified by [CONTACT_456]
(see sections 5.13.2 and 5.14.3) and in accordance with applicable regulatory
requirement(s).

only in accordance with the approved protocol.
4.6.6  The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093]/institution,
should explain the correct use of the investigational product(s) to each subject and
should check, at intervals appropriate for the trial, that each subject is following
the instructions properly.
4.7 Randomization Procedures and Unblinding
The investigator should follow the trial's randomization procedures, if any, and should
ensure that the code is broken only in accordance with the protocol.  If the trial is blinded,
17the investigator should promptly document and explain to the sponsor any premature
unblinding (e.g., accidental unblinding, unblinding due to a serious adverse event) of the
investigational product(s).
4.8 Informed Consent of Trial Subjects
4.8.1  In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should
comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to GCP
and to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Prior to the beginning of the trial, the investigator should have the IRB/IEC's
written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_477867].
4.8.[ADDRESS_613152]’s consent.  Any revised
written informed consent form, and written information should receive the
IRB/IEC's approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349].  The subject or the
subject’s legally acceptable representative should be informed in a timely manner if
new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s
willingness to continue participation in the trial.  The communication of this
information should be documented.
4.8.[ADDRESS_613153]'s legally acceptable representative to waive or to appear to waive

legally acceptable representative has orally consented to the subject’s participation
in the trial, and, if capable of doing so, has signed and personally dated the
informed consent form, the witness should sign and personally date the consent
form.  By [CONTACT_17317], the witness attests that the information in the
consent form and any other written information was accurately explained to, and
apparently understood by, the subject or the subject's legally acceptable
representative, and that informed consent was freely given by [CONTACT_477916]’s legally acceptable representative.
4.8.10  Both the informed consent discussion and the written informed consent
form and any other written information to be provided to subjects should include
explanations of the following:
(a)  That the trial involves research.

(j)  The compensation and/or treatment available to the subject in the event
of trial-related injury. 
(k)  The anticipated prorated payment, if any, to the subject for
participating in the trial.
(l)  The anticipated expenses, if any, to the subject for participating in the
trial.
(m)  That the subject's participation in the trial is voluntary and that the
subject may refuse to participate or withdraw from the trial, at any time,
without penalty or loss of  benefits to which the subject is otherwise
entitled. 
(n)  That the monitor(s), the auditor(s), the IRB/IEC, and the regulatory
authority(ies) will be granted direct access to the subject's original medical
records for verification of clinical trial procedures and/or data, without
violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_477917], by [CONTACT_2960] a written informed
consent form, the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative
is authorizing such access.
(o)  That records identifying the subject will be kept confidential and, to the
extent permitted by [CONTACT_29695]/or regulations, will not be made
publicly available.  If the results of the trial are published, the subject’s
identity will remain confidential. 
(p)  That the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative will
be informed in a timely manner if information becomes available that may

4.8.[ADDRESS_613159]'s legally
acceptable representative should receive a copy of the signed and dated written
informed consent form and any other written information provided to the subjects. 
During a subject’s participation in the trial, the subject or the subject’s legally
acceptable representative should receive a copy of the signed and dated consent
form updates and a copy of any amendments to the written information provided
to subjects.
4.8.12  When a clinical trial (therapeutic or nontherapeutic) includes subjects who
can only be enrolled in the trial with the consent of the subject’s legally acceptable
representative (e.g., minors, or patients with severe dementia), the subject should
be informed about the trial to the extent compatible with the subject’s
understanding and, if capable, the subject should assent, sign and personally date
the written informed consent.
4.8.13  Except as described in 4.8.14, a nontherapeutic trial (i.e., a trial in which
there is no anticipated direct clinical benefit to the subject) should be conducted in
subjects who personally give consent and who sign and date the written informed
consent form.
4.8.14  Nontherapeutic trials may be conducted in subjects with consent of a
legally acceptable representative provided the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)  The objectives of the trial cannot be met by [CONTACT_3553] a trial in subjects
who can give informed consent personally.
(b)  The foreseeable risks to the subjects are low.
(c)  The negative impact on the subject’s well-being is minimized and low.
(d)  The trial is not prohibited by [CONTACT_2371].

the inclusion of such subjects, and the written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_477869]. 
21Such trials, unless an exception is justified, should be conducted in patients having
a disease or condition for which the investigational product is intended.  Subjects
in these trials should be particularly closely monitored and should be withdrawn if
they appear to be unduly distressed.
4.8.[ADDRESS_613160]'s legally acceptable representative, if present, should be
requested.  When prior consent of the subject is not possible, and the subject’s
legally acceptable representative is not available, enrollment of the subject should
require measures described in the protocol and/or elsewhere, with documented
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1686]/IEC, to protect the rights, safety, and well-
being of the subject and to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory
requirements.  The subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative should
be informed about the trial as soon as possible and consent to continue and other
consent as appropriate (see section 4.8.10) should be requested.
4.9 Records and Reports
4.9.1  The investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and
timeliness of the data reported to the sponsor in the CRFs and in all required
reports.
4.9.2  Data reported on the CRF, which are derived from source documents,
should be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies should be
explained.
4.9.3  Any change or correction to a CRF should be dated, initialed, and explained
(if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry (i.e., an audit trail should
be maintained); this applies to both written and electronic changes or corrections
(see section 5.18.4(n)).  Sponsors should provide guidance to investigators and/or
the investigators' designated representatives on making such corrections.  Sponsors
should have written procedures to assure that changes or corrections in CRFs
made by [CONTACT_3211]'s designated representatives are documented, are necessary, and
are endorsed by [CONTACT_093].  The investigator should retain records of the
changes and corrections.
4.9.4  The investigator/institution should maintain the trial documents as specified
in Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial (see section 8.) and as
required by [CONTACT_8146](s).  The investigator/institution
should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these
documents.
224.9.[ADDRESS_613161].  These documents should be retained for a longer period,
however, if required by [CONTACT_477919].  It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained
(see section 5.5.12).
4.9.6  The financial aspects of the trial should be documented in an agreement
between the sponsor and the investigator/institution.
4.9.[ADDRESS_613162] of the monitor, auditor, IRB/IEC, or regulatory authority, the
investigator/institution should make available for direct access all requested trial-
related records. 
4.10 Progress Reports
4.10.1  Where required by [CONTACT_1214], the investigator
should submit written summaries of the trial’s status to the institution.  The
investigator/institution should submit written summaries of the status of the trial to
the IRB/IEC annually, or more frequently, if requested by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC.
4.10.2  The investigator should promptly provide written reports to the sponsor,
the IRB/IEC (see section 3.3.8), and, where required by [CONTACT_477920], the institution on any changes significantly affecting the conduct of
the trial, and/or increasing the risk to subjects.
4.11 Safety Reporting
4.11.1  All serious adverse events (SAEs) should be reported immediately to the
sponsor except for those SAEs that the protocol or other document (e.g.,
Investigator's Brochure) identifies as not needing immediate reporting.  The
immediate reports should be followed promptly by [CONTACT_12908], written reports.  The
immediate and follow-up reports should identify subjects by [CONTACT_477921]' names, personal
identification numbers, and/or addresses.  The investigator should also comply
with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) related to the reporting of
unexpected serious adverse drug reactions to the regulatory authority(ies) and the
IRB/IEC.
234.11.2  Adverse events and/or laboratory abnormalities identified in the protocol as
critical to safety evaluations should be reported to the sponsor according to the
reporting requirements and within the time periods specified by [CONTACT_477922].
4.11.3  For reported deaths, the investigator should supply the sponsor and the
IRB/IEC with any additional requested information (e.g., autopsy reports and
terminal medical reports).
4.12 Premature Termination or Suspension of a Trial
If the trial is terminated prematurely or suspended for any reason, the
investigator/institution should promptly inform the trial subjects, should assure appropriate
therapy and follow-up for the subjects, and, where required by [CONTACT_477923](s), should inform the regulatory authority(ies).  In addition:
4.12.1  If the investigator terminates or suspends a trial without prior agreement of
the sponsor, the investigator should inform the institution, where required by [CONTACT_302395], and the investigator/institution should
promptly inform the sponsor and the IRB/IEC, and should provide the sponsor and
the IRB/IEC a detailed written explanation of the termination or suspension.
4.12.2  If the sponsor terminates or suspends a trial (see section 5.21), the
investigator should promptly inform the institution, where required by [CONTACT_302395], and the investigator/institution should
promptly inform the IRB/IEC and provide the IRB/IEC a detailed written
explanation of the termination or suspension.
4.12.3  If the IRB/IEC terminates or suspends its approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a
trial (see sections 3.1.2 and 3.3.9), the investigator should inform the institution,
where required by [CONTACT_1214], and the
investigator/institution should promptly notify the sponsor and provide the sponsor
with a detailed written explanation of the termination or suspension.
4.13 Final Report(s) by [CONTACT_10670]/Institution
Upon completion of the trial, the investigator should, where required by [CONTACT_302397], inform the institution, and the investigator/institution should
provide the sponsor with all required reports, the IRB/IEC with a summary of the trial’s
outcome, and the regulatory authority(ies) with any report(s) they require of the
investigator/institution.

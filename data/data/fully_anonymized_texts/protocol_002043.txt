 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1. Synopsis 
Study Title: A Randomized, Open -Label, Phase 2a Comparator Study to Assess the Pharmacodynamics, Safety 
and Pharmacokinetics of Oral Administration of MNK6106 (L -Ornithine Phenylacetate) Versus Rifaximin in 
Subjects With Hepatic Cirrhosis and a History of Prior Epi[INVESTIGATOR_155534]: MNK61062107  Type: Interventional/Phase 2 a 
Condition/Disease:  Hepatic Cirrhosis and a History of Prior Epi[INVESTIGATOR_155535]: [ADDRESS_179917] Participation:  6 weeks 
Rationale :  
Current treatment strategies for the prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy ( HE) are limited to the correction 
or removal of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4582], as well as the imperfect reduction of circulating ammonia ( AMM) levels by 
[CONTACT_155565]/or pharmacological approaches. Pharmacological approaches include non-absorbed 
disaccharides ( eg, lactulose) and antibiotics ( eg, neomycin and rifaximin), which target AMM absorption and 
change the gut microbiome to non -urease-producing bacteria reducing intestinal AMM production, respectively.  
Lactulose is orally/rectally administered, does not directly target AMM metabolism, has limited efficacy in 
subjects with acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_155536], is difficult to administer, and requires doses taken frequently 
throughout the day.  
Rifaximin is indicated  for reduction in risk of overt HE recurrence in patients at least 18 years of age.  
In the trials of rifaximin for HE, 91% of the subjects were using lactulose concomitantly. Differences in the 
treatment effect of those subjects not using lactulose concomi tantly could not be assessed.  
In the Phase 1/2a study OCR002 -SP103, which was conducted with the oral formulation of 
MNK6106  (L-Ornithine phenylacetate tablets) although the percentage change in blood AMM concentrations 
was highly variable, MNK6106 dosing of [ADDRESS_179918] prevent increases in AMM concentrations following the discontinuation of lactulose .

 2. INTRODUCTION  
MNK610 6 is a novel ammonia  (AMM)-lowering agent that uses pathways of AMM removal to 
reduce plasma AMM concentration in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic encephalopathy 
(HE). 
MNK6106 (ornithine phenylacetate), in the form of the L -ornithine (ORN) salt of phenylacetate 
(PAA), is a single new chemical entity that allows for alternative pathways for the excretion of 
AMM in the setting of cirrhosis through the enhanced elimination of AMM (Jalan et al, 2007 ). 
L-ornithine stimulate s the activity of glutamine synthetase, inducing body muscle to trap 
circulating AMM in the form of glutamine, which is a nontoxic carrier of AMM. Glutamine is 
then conjugated with PAA to form PAGN, which is excreted in urine. This strategy prevents the 
eventual recirculation and degradation of glutamine by [CONTACT_155566] -formation of 
AMM. 
L-Ornithine phenylacetate  was granted orphan drug status in 2010 by [CONTACT_48354] (FDA ); for the treatment of hyperammonemia and associated hepatic 
encephalopathy in patients with acute liver failure or acute or chronic liver disease . 
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of products 
containing L-Ornithine phenylacetate  is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure ( Mallinckrodt, 
2019). 
2.1. Background  
Although the onset of HE can rarely be pi[INVESTIGATOR_155540], it is a landmark in patients with 
advanced liver disease (Wijdicks, 2016 ). An estimated 60% to 70% of cirrhotic patients have at 
least subtle signs of neurocognitive impairment. Overt HE has a prevalence of approximately 
30% in patients with end -stage liver disease , and accounts for  about 150,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155541] (Al Sibae et al, 2009 ). Severe HE in patients with cirrhosis is 
associated with a mortality of more than 50% in the first year alone  (Wijdicks, 2016 ). 
HE is a neuropsychiatric disorder that occurs when gut derived toxins , primarily AMM, by[CONTACT_6476] a 
failing liver, which would normally detoxify such agents . These toxins enter the circula tion and 
cross the blood brain barrier, resulting in impairment of neurotransmission and central nervous 
system (CNS) function. HE can arise in the setting of acute liver failure, chronic progressive 
liver disease in the context of advanced liver cirrhosis  (overt HE), and/or as a result of portocaval 
shunting with or without liver disease. The pathogenesis of HE has been incompletely 
understood but the increase in plasma AMM levels remains central to the understanding of HE 
(Wijdicks, 2016 ), supporting the need for novel, safe, and effective AMM lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_155542].  
Dietary protein restriction had long been advocated as a strategy to reduce circulating AMM in 
patients with cirrhosis. However, recent data have shown that this strategy is not effective in 
preventing HE and may harm these patient s by [CONTACT_155567] 
(Cordoba et a l, 2004). 

Protocol MNK61062107 Amendment [ADDRESS_179925] line agent, adjusted for the production of 
3 bowel movements daily (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, 2014 ). 
Rifaximin, which alters gut microbiota, is recommended as an add -on therapy to lactulose for 
prevention of HE recurrence (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, 2014 ); 
(Wijdicks, 2016 ). However, recent data suggest that a significant number of patients receiving 
lactulose and rifaximin are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155543] a recurrence  of HE (Kulkarni et al, 2018 ). 
MNK6106 ( L-Ornithine phenylacetate ), in the form of an orally administered ORN salt of PAA , 
is a single new ch emical entity that allows for alternative pathways for the excretion of AMM in 
the setting of cirrhosis through the enhanced elimination of AMM. 
2.1.1. Nonclinical Safety Data  
The nonclinical safety of L-Ornithine phenylacetate  was evaluated in a series of in vitro and 
in vivo studies which included evaluation of the potential undesirable pharmacodynamic (PD) 
effects of L-Ornithine phenylacetate  on physiological functions in relation to exposure in the 
therapeutic range and abov e (safety pharmacology core battery), evaluation of the mutagenic and 
clastogenic potentials of L-Ornithine phenylacetate  (in vitro and in vivo test battery for 
genotoxicity), evaluation of the short - and longer -term functional and morphologic effects 
associated with L-Ornithine phenylacetate  exposure in whole animal models (mammalian 
toxicology program), evaluation of the effects of L-Ornithine phenylacetate  on fertility and 
embryo-fetal development, and evaluation of local intravenous (IV) and gastrointes tinal tract 
effects of L-Ornithine phenylacetate  administration. The results of the toxicology program 
indicate that L-Ornithine phenylacetate  does not present a genotoxic hazard and is associated 
with a low potential for local (oral/IV) and systemic toxic ity in humans. Potential adverse effects 
of L-Ornithine phenylacetate  on sperm parameters (count and morphology) and embryo -fetal 
development were noted at high doses/systemic exposures.  
2.1.2. Clinical Safety Data  
Safety data from completed sponsor and investiga tor-initiated clinical studies demonstrated  that 
a single IV dose of 20 g L-Ornithine phenylacetate  IV solution (MNK6105)  infused over 4 hours 
or daily 20 g IV doses infused over 24  hours for up to 5  days, were generally well tolerated.  
Regarding oral admi nistration with MNK6106 ( L-Ornithine phenylacetate  tablets), Study 
OCR002-SP103 was an open -label Phase 1/2a, 2 -part crossover study in 30 adult subjects with 
varying degrees of cirrhosis, who received oral administration of MNK6106 . The safety 
conclusions  were that MNK6106  was safe and well -tolerated when administered at doses up to 
21 g/day for 5 days. There were no deaths , 1 serious adverse event ( SAE) was reported during 
Part 2 of the study  (SAE of urinary tract infection in a subject while receiving 21  g/day; the event  
was considered not related to study drug treatment ). In addition, safety data from completed 
Phase 1/2a clinical studies with a single IV dose of 5 g given as an oral solution, as well as oral 
administration of MNK6106 tablets (6  g, 12 g, and 21 g per day for 3 periods, 5 days per period 
with a minimum 4 -day washout in between) indicate that both IV and oral administration of L-

 Ornithine phenylacetate  were generally well tolerated.  No Phase 2/[ADDRESS_179926] 
been initiated.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of L-Ornithine 
phenylacetate  is provided in the Investigat or’s Brochure (Mallinckrodt, 2019 ). 
2.2. Study Rationale  
Current treatment strategies for the prevention of overt HE are limited to the correction or 
removal of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4582], as well as the imperfect reduction of circulating AMM levels by 
[CONTACT_155565]/or pharmacological approaches. Pharmacologica l approaches include 
non-absorbed disaccharides (eg, lactulose) and antibiotics (eg, neomycin and rifaximin), which 
target AMM absorption and change the gut microbiome to non -urease-producing bacteria 
reducing intestinal AMM production, respectively.  
Lactulose is orally/rectally administered, does not directly target AMM metabolism, has limited 
efficacy in subjects with acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_155536], is difficult to administer, and requires doses 
taken frequently throughout the day.  
Rifaximin is indicated for reduction in risk of overt HE recurrence in patients at least 18 years of 
age. 
In the trials of rifaximin for HE, 91% of the patients were using lactulose concomitantly. 
Differences in the treatment effect of those patients not using lactulose concomitantl y could not 
be assessed (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, 2014 ); (Wijdicks, 2016 ); 
(Horizon Therapeutics, 2017 ). 
In a Phase 1/2a Study OCR002 -SP103, dosing of [ADDRESS_179927] 
prevent increases in AMM concentrations following the discontinuati on of lactulose . 
MNK6105 has been evaluated  in two Phase 1 studies: OCR002-HV201 (healthy subjects ) and 
OCR002-HE201 (subjects with Child-Pugh [C-P] Class A or B cirrhosis ) and in two investigator 
initiated Phase 2 studies : 
 OP-GIB study (in subjects with  cirrhosis and active gastrointestinal bleeding ) and  
 OCR002-HE209 (in subjects with cirrhosis and HE). 
The OCR002-HE209 study with MNK6105 (10 g/day, 15 g/day, and 20 g/day IV for 5 days) 
data suggested better clinical improvement, plasma AMM-lowering/norm alizing PD effects ratio 
and decrease in AMM concentrations in subjects receiving MNK6105  compared to  placebo.  
2.3. Assessment of Potential Benefits and Risks   
The results of nonclinical pharmacological studies support the clinical use of L-Ornithine 
phenylacetate  in the treatment of hyperammonemia and acute HE . The studies  demonstrated 

Protocol MNK61062107 Amendment 4 Version 5.0  L-OPA Oral Formulation

Confidential and Proprietary  
 AMM reduction in pig (Ytrebo et al, 2009 ) and rat models  (Davies et al, 2009 ) - effects not seen 
with anti-inflammatory therapy ( with a tumor necrosis factor alpha  antagonist) if 
hyperammonemia remain ed untreated (Wright et al, 2011 ). Significant red uction in AMM levels 
was replicated in [ADDRESS_179928] ligated cirrhotic 
rat model (Mookerjee et al, 2009 );(Vairappan et al, 2009 ). 
L-Ornithine phenylacetate  increases AMM elimination by [CONTACT_155568] (action of ornithine) and its excretion as PAGN (action of PAA ). L-
Ornithine phenylacetate  also reduces AMM production by [CONTACT_155569] 
(action of ORN), demonstrating the synergistic effect of the 2 pharmacophores (Jover-Cobos et 
al, 2014). 
L-Ornithine phenylacetate  prevented neurophysiological abnormalities in a porta caval shunted 
rat model following a simulated gastrointestinal bleed. L-Ornithine phenylacetate  treatment 
significantly blunted the rise in AMM generated by a simulated gastrointestinal bleed. The 
reduction in plasma AMM was associated with normalization of neurophysiologic function as 
assessed by [CONTACT_155570]. These studies provide the pharmacological rationale for 
using L-Ornithine ph enylacetate  in cirrhotic patients to prevent hepatic encephalopathy 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_155544] (Oria et al, 2012 ). 
The conclusion, based on the adverse event (AE) data from the nonclinical pharmacological 
studies support ing the clinical use of L-Ornithine phenylacetate  in the treatment of 
hyperammonemia and acute HE , is that a 20 g dose infused over 24  hours, appears to be well 
tolerated. 
In aggregate, the clinical data presented provide assurance of appropriate benefit/risk for the 
administration of MNK6105  in patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155545]. The 
safety and PK data collected to date from completed studies OCR002 -HV201, OCR002 -HE201, 
OCR002-HE209 along with t he information supplied in the product label for RAVICTI® 
(glycerol phenylbut yrate) and similar other products, support the selection of MNK6105 infused 
up to 20 g/ [ADDRESS_179929] been 
used in the treatment of  hyperammonemia for over 20 years ; ORN as an over the counter 
nutritional supplement and PAA to treat hyperammonemia in patients with urea cycle disorders . 
Substantial data therefore exists on the safety of both L -ornithine, sodium PAA and 
phenylbutyrate; albeit PAA data supports the use of the compound in the treatment of urea cycle 
disorders. 
Toxicity with sodium PAA has been observed in PK studies in both healthy volunteers and 
patients with cancer. In these studies, the drug was administered rapi[INVESTIGATOR_155546] [ADDRESS_179930] been reported to generally correlate with PAA maximum plasma concentration . 
Dose-related adverse effects in these studies were gastrointestinal (eg, nausea and vomiting) and 
CNS (eg, somnolence, fatigue, and headache) in nature.

 Concentrations over 400 μg/mL of PAA have been associated with nausea and vomiting 
[Summary Basis of Approval for AMMONUL®] and concentrations over 490 μg/mL have been 
associated with CNS -related AEs when administered in bolus doses in prior PK studies in 
healthy adult volunteers and in patients with cancer.  
Some cancer patients treated with sodium phenylacetate  had signs and s ymptoms of PAA 
neurotoxicity including somnolence, fatigue, lightheadedness, headache, dysgeusia, hypoacusis, 
disorientation, impaired memory, and exacerbation of preexisting peripheral neuropathy. In this 
study, these adverse effects were reported to be g enerally transient and reversible (Thibault et al, 
1994); (Thibault et al, 1995 ). 
Some patients with urea cycle disorders treated in clinical trials with RAVICTI have experienced 
headache, fatigue, symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, seizures, tremor and/or dizziness. No 
correlation between PAA levels and neurotoxicity symptoms was identified but PAA levels were 
generally not measured at the time of neurotoxicity symptoms (Horizon Therapeutics, 2017 ). 
Appropriate dosing for MNK6106  has not yet been determined.  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefi t, risks, and reasonably ex pected 
AEs associated with L-Ornithine phenylacetate  can be found in the Investigat or’s Brochure 
(Mallinckrodt, 2019 ).

Outcome measures are identified to facilitate clinical trial registration and patient access to basic 
results disclosed on public clinical trial registries.  
The primary outcome measure in the study is the  number of pa rticipants with a change in 
ammonia at Day 5 . 
The secondary outcome measure in the study is the number of participants with adverse events or 
deaths du ring the study . 
4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1. Overall Design  
This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group, multi ple-dose, dose -ranging, active control, 
Phase 2a study. The objective of the study is  to assess the PD, safety and PK of different doses of 
MNK6106 (oral administration) vs rifaximin in subjects 18 to 80 years of age (inclusive) with 
hepatic cirrhosis and a history of prior epi[INVESTIGATOR_155537].  
Approximately 48 subjects will be randomize d to meet the primary objective . Subjects may 
participate in the study  for a total of up to approximately 6 weeks, including a screening period 
of up to 28 days, a treatment period of 1 week (5 days), and a final visit 1 week (7 days [+ 3 day 
window]) after ending study treatment .  
The final visit window may be extended, due to extenuating circumstances, to 14 days after 
discussion with the Sponsor.  
Subjects will be confined to the study center overnight during the 5 -day treatment period and 
randomly assigned  to receive 1 of 3 dose regimens of MNK6106 or the comparator rifaximin for 
5 days. 
Approximately  48 subjects will be 1:1:1:1 randomized to 1 of the 4 groups. Subjects will receive 
either 1 of the 3 MNK6106 dosing regimens  (2 g three times daily , 4 g twice daily , or 4 g three 
times daily ) or rifaximin (550 mg twice daily ) taken orally for 5 days. Samples for plasma AMM 
levels will be drawn at screening and on Days 1, 3 and 5 /ET, predose in the morning 
immediately before breakfast and 4 h ours (± 15 minutes) after the morning dos e as well as at the 
final visit . Samples for plasma PAA , ORN and PAGN  will be drawn prior to the first dose on 
Day 1 (within  15 minutes prior to the morning dose) and then prior to (within 10 min utes) and 1 
hour (± 15 minutes) after the last dose on Day s 1, 3, and 5 /ET. Subjects will remain in the clinic 
overnight during Day 5 /ET and be discharged on Day [ADDRESS_179931] 24  hour urine collection is 
completed.

 All treatment groups will be dosed orally as follows:  
 Group A: MNK6106 2 g  (2 tablets) , three times daily for 5 days  
(6 g daily dose and 30 g total dose) . 
 Group B: MNK6106 4 g  (4 tablets) , twice daily  for 5 days  
(8 g daily dose and 40 g total dose).  
 Group C: MNK6106 4 g  (4 tablets) , three times daily  for 5 days (12 g daily dose and 
60 g total dose).  
 Group D: Rifaximin 550 mg tablet  (1 tablet), twice daily  for 5 days  
(1.1 g daily dose  and 5.5 g total dose) . 
Approximately [ADDRESS_179932] to evaluate the oral administration of  
MNK6106 tablets vs rifaximin 550 mg tablets twice daily  as well as to characterize  the PK/PD of 
MNK6106 in subjects . 
4.2.1. Dose Rationale  
In Study OCR002 -SP103 with, oral administration of MNK6106 at dose levels of 2 g, 4 g and 
7 g three times daily  (total 6 g, 12 g, and 21 g daily), the reduction in AMM concentrations  
appeared to be similar at the doses of 12 g and 21 g daily , with 6 g being able to prevent 
increases in AMM concentrations. This observation was consistent with MNK6105  (L-Ornithine 
phenylacetate  IV formulation),  where the effect of L-Ornithine phenylacetate was maximized  at 
a dose of 15 g/day. Given the fact that MNK6106 (L-Ornithine phenylacetate oral formulation) 
has demonstrated excellent absolute bioavailability ( greater than  95%), the 12 g oral formulation 
is expected to achieve comparable exposure as MNK6105 15 g. Therefore, the high dose in this 
study was selected as 12 g/d ay (4 g three times dail y). The low dose of 6 g/d ay was chosen 
because it was able to prevent an increase in AMM concentrations.  
Since a twice daily  dose is favorable for compliance, a 4 g twice a day (8 g daily) regimen was 
selected, to maximize the reduction in AMM following each administration.  
4.3. End of Study Definition

water. The date and actual (clock) time that the su bject receives the MNK6106 study drug and 
the dose amount administered will be recorded on the electronic case report form ( eCRF). Any 

Protocol MNK61062107 Amendment [ADDRESS_179941] estimated and recorded. Replacements will be 
made accordingly.  
The study drug s will be administered under fed (30 minutes after start of meal) conditions. 
Lunch and dinner will be served at approximately [ADDRESS_179942] 2  hours 
after dosing . In addition, subjects will also be required to refrain from anything more than light 
exercise while confined at the study site.  
6.2. Study Treatm ent Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
MNK6106  tablets are packed into high -density polyethylene bottles with child -resistant caps, 
60 tablets per bottle.  
The bottles of MNK6106 and rifaximin should be stored at room temperature 20° C to 25°C 
(68°F to 77°F); excursions are permitted between 15° C to 30°C (59° F to 86°F). 
The sponsor will supply MNK6106 and rifaximin. The investigator or investigator’s designee  
will maintain the following records: receipt of shipments, dispensation to subjects, and ret urn of 
empty, partially used, and unopened bottles. Reasons for departure from the expected dispensing 
regimen must also be recorded.  
Study drug should not be returned before the designated study monitor has checked the drug 
accountability records with the  study site personnel after database lock . 
Upon receipt of the study drug supplies, the investigator or investigator’s designee  will conduct 
an inventory, follow the process for acknowledging receipt of the study drug, and complete 
appropriate form(s). One  copy of the receipt and the packing slip must be retained.  
At the completion of the study, to satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, 
all study treatment s will be reconciled and retained or destroyed according to applicable 
regulations. 
The investigator or designee will confirm that appropriate temperature control conditions have 
been maintained during transit for all study treatments received and confirm that any 
discrepancies are reported and resolved prior to study treatment admin istration. 
The study treatment will be maintained in a monitored, environmentally controlled  
(in accordance with treatment labeling) , secure, locked area with restricted access at the 
study site. 
Only subjects enrolled in the study will receive study treat ment and only authorized study staff 
will dispense study treatment.

Confidential and Proprietary  
 In accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation  (ICH) requirements, at all times 
the investigator will  be able to account for all study treatment furnished to the study site . 
An accountability record will be maintained for this purpose. The investigator must maintain 
accurate records indicating dates and quantity of study treatment received, to whom it was 
administered (subject-by-subject accounting) and accounts of any study  treatment accidentally or 
deliberately destroyed. All unused study treatment not involved in immediate subject treatment 
will be maintained under locked, temperature -controlled storage at the study site.  
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias  
This is an open -label study. Subjects will be randomized according to a pre-specified, validated 
computer -generated allocation scheme to receive the 4 treatments described above based on a 
1:1:1:[ADDRESS_179943] will be assigned a unique identification (ID) number. The subject ID number will 
be assigned electronically by [CONTACT_155572]. The subject ID number will be used to identify 
the subjects for the duration of the study with in all systems and documentation. A subject with a 
signed ICF in place will be assigned a [ADDRESS_179944] number preceded by [CONTACT_941] 4 -digit 
study site number with a “dash” in between (ie , XXXX-XXXX). Each part must start with a 
non-zero number.  
If the subject is not eligible to receive study treatment, or should discontinue from the study, the 
subject ID number will not be reassigned to another subject.   
In the event that a subject repeats any evaluation during the screening window, they will not 
receive a new ID number. In addition, s ubjects who fail screening and are rescreened will not 
receive a new subject ID number. Qualified subjects who meet all of the eligibility criteria will 
be randomized into the study.  
The investigator must maintain a subject master log linking the subject ID to the subject’s name. 
The investigator must follow all applicable privacy laws in order to protect a subject’s privacy 
and confidentiality. Information that could identify a subject will be masked on material rece ived 
by [CONTACT_456].  
Subjects will be randomized according to a treatment allocation scheme that will be sent to each 
site. The treatment assigned will be recorded in the source documentation.  
Based on the randomized treatment assignment, the investigator or investigator’s designee  will 
dispense the study treatment  tablets (MNK6106 or rifaximin) for each subject . 
6.4. Study Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance will be determined by [CONTACT_155573].

The start and stop date, dose, unit, frequency, route of administration, and indication for all prior 
(taken within the 30 days prior to the Sc reening Visit) and concomitant (taken from the 
Screening Visit through to the Final Visit) medications and nondrug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, blood 
transfusions, oxygen supplementation , physical therapy , etc.) received will be recorded.  
6.5.1. Prohibited Concomitant Therapi [INVESTIGATOR_155548]  (from Randomization through to 
the Final Visit): 
 Current use of drugs that could potentially interfere with renal excretion of PAGN, 
such as corticosteriod s, haloperidol, valproic acid probenecid, estrone sulfate, 
ibuprofen, cimetidine, or diclofenac. Use of L-ornithine L -aspartate is prohibited.  
 Current use of drugs whose plasma concentration  may be affected by [CONTACT_155564]6106, 
such as alfentanil, cyclosporine, midazolam, quinidine,  or cimetidine.  Metformin use 
is permitted at low doses. Doses of metformin > 1,000 mg should be discussed with 
the medical monitor prior to enrollment.  
 Current use of AMMONUL® (sodium benzoate with sodium PAA), BUPHENYL® 
(sodium phenylbutyrate), RAVICTI, or other medica tions containing  sodium 
benzoate or sodium phenylbutyrate.  
 Current use of rifaximin  (except for subjects randomized to rifaximin), oral 
neomycin , oral vancomycin or any other oral or parenteral antibiotic that could 
potentially alter gut flora.  There shoul d be a 5-day washout period for rifaximin use 
prior to the first dose of study drug.  
 Current use of repaglinide.  
 Receipt of an investigational product or device, or participation in a drug research 
study within a period of 30 days (or 5 half -lives of the d rug, whichever is longer) 
before the first dose of study treatment . 
 Any investigational drug, device, or procedure administered as part of a research 
study.  
Exceptions to these restrictions during the subject selection process must be approved by [CONTACT_155574] a case -by-case basis. Once the study has 
started, if a subject is unable to comply with the restrictions described above, their participation 
in the study will be re -evaluated by [CONTACT_093], again in cons ultation with the sponsor. The 
decision to continue a subject who has received a concomitant medication as directed by [CONTACT_155575].

 If any prohibited medication is taken during the study, all pertinent information will be recorded 
in source documents and the eCRF. The designated study medical monitor ( MM) must be 
informed immediately so the sponsor may determine whether to continue the  subject in the 
study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sedatives  
Due to the importance of accurately measuring mental status during the treatment period of this 
study, sedation is an important potential confounder, and thus, sedatives should not be used 
during the study period. Sedatives  such as benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (eg, alprazolam, alcyon, midazolam, 
oxazepam, triazolam, lorazepam, estazolam, temazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, 
clonazepam, flurazepam, clorazepate) and sleep aids (eg, haloperidol, zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], Midol PM®, 
Sominex®, trazodone [D esyrel®], Sleep-eze®), are not allowed during the treatment period 
through completion of the final visit and, if applicable, +  24 hours after final visit assessments.  
Any psychoactive agents including strong analgesics, antidepressants, and/or anxiolytics should 
be avoided. Narcotic use should be avoided due to subject sensitivity to these agents. Any use of 
sedation must be consistent with standard medical therapy. If sedation is unavoidable, use drugs 
with a short half -life (eg, diprivan) as well as drugs  that do not have synergistic effects with 
endogenous promoters of HE (eg, avoid benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]).  
Mind-altering agents (such as barbiturates, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) should be avoided 
during the treatment period through completion of the final visit and, if applicable, +  24 hours 
after final visit assessments.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Neuroactive Agents  
Avoid agents that can precipi[INVESTIGATOR_155549], such as prochlorperazine (Compazine®), promethazine (Phenergan®), 
trimethobenzamide (Tigan®), dronabinol (Marinol®), metoclopramide (Reglan®), or any of the 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]. These drugs are not allowed during the treatment period until after completion 
of all assessments at the final visit and, if applicabl e, + [ADDRESS_179945] 
abstain from tobacco products , including vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  during confinement at the study center . 
6.5.3. Meals and Fluids  
The study drug s will be administered under fed conditions (30 minutes after the start of a 
standardized meal). Lunch and dinner will be served at approximately 30 minutes prior to 
dosing.

 For all subjects, standardized, balanced meals will be provided while subjects are confined at the 
research unit. The meals will be nutritionally balanced and will contain  sufficient fiber/roughage 
to maintain normal bowel activity.  
Snacks are permitted throughout the day , except on Day 1 , Day 3, and Day 5 /ET beginning 
[ADDRESS_179946] per day (including all meals and snacks)  should not 
exceed 1. 5 g/kg body weight per day. 
In order to facilitate urine production, subjects will be encouraged to drink fluids frequently 
throughout the confinement period. 
7. DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY TREATMENT AND SUBJECT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITH DRAWAL  
The duration of the study is defined for each subject as the date that signed written informed 
consent is provided until completion of the final visit or until premature withdrawal from the 
study for any other reason (eg, death, physician decision, subject/caregiver withdraws consent, 
lost to follow-up). 
Subjects (or their caregivers) may withdraw consent  from the study at any time and for any 
reason, without prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_155576]. Every effort should be made to keep subjects in the study. The reason for study treatment 
discontinuation  or subject withdrawal from the study  will be record ed in the subject’s  eCRF. 
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Subjects who discontinue, or are withdrawn from study treatment for any reason, will be 
encouraged to complete the final visit and provide any additional follow -up information as 
required by [CONTACT_1758], unless the subject specifically  indicates that they will not participate in any 
further evaluation s. 
Permanent study treatment discontinuation is required for any of the following:  
 A ‘serious’ adverse reaction (ie,  an SAE considered at least possibly related to the 
study treatment  administration) in [ADDRESS_179947]. 
 Grade 4 AEs as per Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) v5.0 that are 
not expected in the context of underlying medical conditions.  
 The investigator consider s study treatment discontinuation to be in the subject’s best 
interest for any other reason.  
 Major protocol violation.  
 Symptoms of an intercurrent illness not consistent with the protocol requirements or 
that justify withdrawal.

  The subject becomes pregnant.  
Discontinuation of study treatment for abnormal liver function should be considered by [CONTACT_32845] a subject meets one of the conditions outlined in  Section 10.5. 
Additional reasons for permanent study treatment discontinuation include, but are not limited to, 
the following:  
 Subject/caregiver withdraws consent to receive study treatment.  
 Death. 
If a clinically significant cardiac finding is identif ied (including but not limited to changes from 
baseline in QTcF) after the star t of study treatment , the investigator or a qualified designee  will 
determine if the subject can continue in the study and if any change in management is needed.  
The reason for  study treatment discontinuation will be recorded.  
No dose modifications or temporary treatment discontinuations are permitted in this study.  
7.2. Subject Discontinuation /Withdrawal From the Study  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own (o r per caregiver’s) request or  
may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, 
compliance, or administrative reasons.  
If the subject/caregiver withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may  
retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. If a 
subject/caregiver withdraws from the study, the subject/caregiver may request destruction of any 
samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in  the study site study 
records. 
The reason for study discontinuation /withdrawal  will be recorded. A subject may be 
discontinued from the study for the following me dical or administrative reasons including, (but 
not limited to) the following:  
Noncompliance  
The subject is noncompliant with the protocol.  
Intercurrent Illness  
The subject has symptoms or an intercurrent illness that is not consistent with the protocol 
requirements or that justify withdrawal.  
Withdrawal by [CONTACT_155577].  

Protocol MNK61062107 Amendment [ADDRESS_179948] suffers an AE that, in the judgment of the investigator, sponsor , or MM; 
presents an unacceptable consequence or risk to the subject, the subject will be discontinued 
from study treatment .  
Death 
In the event that a subject dies during the study, death will be the reason for discontinuation.  
Lost to Follow -up 
Every effort should be used to maintain contact [CONTACT_155578]. A subject may be con sidered lost to follow -up if there is no response to at least [ADDRESS_179949] by [CONTACT_155579] a certified letter  (or equivalent)  sent to the 
last known address of the subject , if possible . Efforts to contact [CONTACT_155580].

8.5. Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
8.5.1. Pharmacodynamic Sampling  
Plasma AMM data are extremely important, but these samples are exquisitely sensitive. For this 
reason, great care must be taken with the collection, handling, processing, and storage of plasma 
AMM samples. 
Samples for plasma AMM levels will be drawn at screening, on Days 1, 3 and 5 /ET predose in 
the morning immediately before breakfast and 4 hours (± 15 minutes) after the morning dose , 
and at the final visit . 
Before the blood draw to collect a sample for venous AMM, place the collection tube on ice for 
at least [ADDRESS_179957] the specimen on wet ice, separate the plasma by [CONTACT_155581] , and freeze the p lasma specimen for analysis at -70°C or colder immediately 
after centrifugation. This specimen will be processed by [CONTACT_155582]61062107 Amendment [ADDRESS_179958] be prepared and 
stored in a -70°C or colder freezer with the greatest speed feasible. All frozen samples will be 
transported to a laboratory testing site. Review the Laboratory Manual/sample handling guide for 
complete information.  
Venous AMM draws are predicated on timing, which is of paramount importance; however, for 
subjects able to eat, it is preferable to obtain the blood sample prior to food intake (if feasible). 
Because of the exquisite delicacy of this analyte stringent before drawing, blood draw and 
specimen processing pa rameters must be adhered to; documentation of each step of preanalytic 
specimen preparation and processing is required for each time point inclusive of date and time 
for each step recorded on the laboratory requisition and source documentation. It is essen tial 
that venous AMM plasma samples be correctly prepared to avoid spurious results; if the 
specimen integrity is compromised by [CONTACT_155583], it would be preferable not to send 
that sample to the laboratory for analysis.  
8.5.2. Pharmacokinetic Sampling  (Plasma PAA , ORN and PAGN ) 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Blood Sampling for Plasma PAA, ORN and PAGN  Measurement  
Blood samples for analysis of PAA , ORN, and PAGN  will be collected on the days and within 
the time windows specified below and in the Schedule of Study Events (Table 1) and shipped to 
the designated bioanalytical lab oratory for analysis. 
Blood samples for plasma concentration of PAA, ORN, and PAGN will be drawn prior to the 
first dose on Day 1 (within 15 minutes prior to morning dose) and then prior to (within 10  
minutes) and 1 hour (± 15 minutes) after the last dose on Day s 1, 3, and 5 /ET. The date and time 
of each samp le collection will be recorde d. 
Peripheral venous blood samples (3 mL each) for analysis of plasma PAA concentrations will be 
drawn into prelabeled  VACUTAINER® tubes containing spray -dried potassium ethylene 
diaminetetra acetic acid by [CONTACT_155584] (if possible) or a periphe ral venous catheter. 
If a peripheral catheter is used, the catheter should be kept patent using a diluted heparin or 
saline drip; and prior to drawing each blood sample, a small volume of blood (~1 mL) should be 
withdrawn from the catheter using a syringe and then discarded so that an undiluted blood 
sample will be collected into the VACUTAINER® tube. The date and exact (clock) time that 
each blood sample is drawn will be recorded on the eCRF . 
Immediately after collection, the blood collection tubes will be  gently inverted 8  to 10 times to 
allow mixing with the anticoagulant and then kept on wet ice or refrigerated until centrifugation. 
Each blood sample will be centrifuged within 1 hour after blood collection in a refrigerated 
centrifuge at the following ap proximate parameters  to separate the plasma : 4°C, 1000 × times 
gravity, and 15 minutes to separate the plasma . All the plasma for each sample will be equally 
divided and transferred to 2 storage tubes of adequate capacity and appropriately pre -labeled. 
Note that 4  mL NUNC CRYOVIAL® polypropylene biofreeze tubes (3.6 mL fill) with screw cap 
(Order # 366524) are preferred. The storage tubes will be labeled, at a minimum, with the 
sponsor company, protocol number, subject number, sample matrix, study day, s cheduled sample

 time and tube number (eg,  #1 or #2). The tubes will be stored in an upright position in a non -self-
defrosting freezer with the temperature maintained at approximately -80°C until shipment to the 
designated bioanalytical laboratory where sam ples will be stored at approximately -80°C. 
Samples should be placed into the freezer within [ADDRESS_179959]  minute. 
8.5.3. Urine Sampling for PAGN Measurement  
Urine collection (with start/end time and volume recorded) for measurement of PAGN, the study 
drug metabolite excreted in urine, will be collected for [ADDRESS_179960] a baseline sample prior to initial dosing on Day 1.  
 Urine collection will start at the initiation of study drug  (predose urine sample) . 
 The next collection interval time starts immediately following the first dose 
administration of the day. For example,  if the first dose of the day is administered at 8 
AM, all urine volume will be collected  through the following morning at 
approximately 8 AM. 
 Measure total volume during each time interval, document collection start/stop times, 
obtain 2 aliquots and freez e immediately as per Laboratory Manual instructions.  
 The final urine collection time interval on Day 5 /ET is from the first dose on Day 
5/ET until the following day , Day 6 (24 hour interval). 
Urine samples for analysis of PAGN elimination will be collected  into pre-labeled polyethylene 
containers for each collection interval. For each 24 -hour collection, all urine will be collected 
during the specified intervals  in the Schedule of Study Events ( Table 1). Subjects will be asked 
to void at the end of each collection interval, but if a subject voids more than once in a single 
collection interval, each void will be added to the collection container for that interval and 
thoroughly mixed. The start and stop time of each collection will be recorded on the eCRF. Care 
should be taken to avoid spi[INVESTIGATOR_155550].  
Once the collection for a time interval is complete, the container (with cumulative urine) will be 
gently shaken (for at least 30 seconds) to mix the urine thoroughly. The total urine volume in 
each collection interval will be measured and recorded. Two 5 mL aliquots of well -mixed urine 
from each collection (including the predose void) will then be transferred to 2 pre -labeled storage 
tubes of adequate capacity with screw caps. The stor age tubes will be stored in an upright 
position in a freezer set at approximately –80°C until shipment to the designated bioanalytical 
facility, where samples will be stored at approximately -80°C. All storage tubes should be 
labeled with a preprinted  label displaying, at a minimum, the sponsor company, protocol 
number, subject number, sample matrix, study day, scheduled collection interval and aliquot 
number (eg,  #1 or #2). Samples should be placed into the freezer within 2 hours from the end of 
each colle ction interval.

of the study. Before signing the consent form(s) and the privacy authorization form (if 
applicable), subjects will have an opportunity to discuss the contents of these forms with study 
site personnel.  
Subjects must assent understanding of and voluntarily sign these forms in compliance with ICH 
GCP and all applicable national and international regulations, before participating in any 
study-related procedures. Subjects will be made aware that they may withdraw from the study at 
any time. Subjects unable to give written informed consent must orally assent to the procedures 
and written informed consent must be obtained from a legal ly authorized representative in 
accordance with national and local laws, as applicable.  
Protocol MNK61062107 Amendment [ADDRESS_179966]'s signed ICF must  be kept on file by [CONTACT_155606]/or authorized Mallinckrodt personnel. Signed copi[INVESTIGATOR_79642](s) and 
the HIPAA authorization form, if applicable,  will be given to the subject.  
The subjects will be made aware of their right to see and copy their records related to the study 
for as long as the investigator has possession of this information. If the subject withdraws 
consent and/or HIPAA authorization , the investigator can no longer disclose health information, 
unless it is needed to preserve the scientific integrity of the study.  
10.1.4. Data Protection  
Study subjects will be assigned a unique identifier by [CONTACT_11153] . Any subject 
records or data sets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; subject 
names or any information which would make the subject identifiable will not be transferred.  
The subjects must be informed that their personal study -related data will be use d by [CONTACT_135711]. The level of disclosure (in accordance with local 
and/or national law) must also be explained to the subject.  
The subjects must be informed that their medical records may be examined by [CONTACT_155607], by [CONTACT_99473]/IEC members, and by [CONTACT_6668].  
10.1.5. Dissemination of Clinical Study Data  
Aggregate results data will be provided to the study sites that actively enrolled subjects into this 
study after the clinical study report is finalized.  
Study results and de-identified individual subject data will be released as required by [CONTACT_123356]/or 
national regulation.  
10.1.6. Data Quality Assurance  
The sponsor  performs quality control and assurance checks on all clinical studies that it sponsors. 
Before enrolling any subjects in this study, sponsor personnel and the investigator review the 
protocol, the Investigat or’s Brochure, the eCRF and instructions for the ir completion, the 
procedure for obtaining informed consent, and the procedure for reporting AEs and SAEs. A 
qualified representative of the sponsor will monitor the conduct of the study.  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/I EC review, and regulatory 
inspections by [CONTACT_155608].  
Each subject’s eCRF should be fully completed and submitted to the sponsor in a timely fashion.  
If an investigator retires, relocates, or otherwise with draws from conducting the study, the 
investigator must notify the sponsor to agree upon an acceptable storage solution. Regulatory 
agencies will be notified with the appropriate documentation.

 Any significant changes in study personnel will require an upda ted statement of investigator 
(ie, FDA Form 1572) to be filed with the sponsor.  
The investigator must notify their IRB/IEC of protocol deviations in accordance with local 
regulatory and IRB/IEC requirements.  
The eCRF data are stored in a database and processed electronically. The sponsor’s MM reviews 
the data for safety information. The data are reviewed for completeness, and logical consistency. 
Automated validation programs will identify missing data, out -of-range data, and other data 
inconsistencies. In addition, c linical laboratory data will be processed electronically. Requests 
for data clarification are forwarded to the study site for resolution.  
10.1.7. Source Documents  
All subject information recorded in the eC RF will be attributable to source data from the study 
site. 
The investigator shall retain and preserve one copy of all data collected or databases generated in 
the course of the study, specifically including but not limited to those defined by [CONTACT_155609]. Essential documents should be retained until at least [ADDRESS_179967]. These documents should be 
retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_155610]. I t is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. Prior to 
destruction of any study essential documents, the investigator must first obtain written approval 
from the spon sor. 
10.1.8. Study and Site Closure  
The sponsor may suspend or terminate the study or part of the study at any time for any reason. 
If the investigator suspends or terminates the study, the investigator will promptly inform the 
sponsor and the IRB/IEC and provide them with a detailed written explanation. Upon study 
completion, the investigator will provide the sponsor, IRB/IEC, and regulatory agency with final 
reports and summaries as required by [CONTACT_19124]. Study termination and follow -up will be 
performed in com pliance with the sponsor or designee standard operating procedures.  
The sponsor, investigator, or local and national regulatory authorities may discover conditions 
during the study that indicate that the study or study site should be terminated. This actio n may 
be taken after appropriate consultation between the sponsor and investigator.  
Conditions that may warrant termination of the study/study site include, but are not limited to:  
 The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjec ts enrolled 
in the study.

 10.3. Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording,  
Evaluating , Follow-Up and Reporting  
10.3.1. Safety 
For safety information about MNK6106 , refer to the most recent version of the Investigat or’s 
Brochure.  
10.3.2. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward or undesirable medic al occurrence in a subject who is administered a 
study treatment , which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:  
 Clinically significant laboratory findings.  
 Clinically sign ificant changes in physical examination findings.  
 An AE occurring due to study treatment  overdose whether accidental or intentional.  
 An AE occurring from study treatment  abuse. 
 An AE associated with study treatment  withdrawal.  
 Unexpected AE. 
An unexpected AE is defined as an AE, the nature and severity of which is not consistent with 
the applicable product information in the most recent version of the Investigat or’s Brochure.  
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
 Death. 
 Life-threatening AE.  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Other serious (important medical events). 
Death 
Death is an outcome of an event. The  cause of death  should be recorded and reported on the SAE 
form. All causes of death must be reported as SAEs. The investigator should make every effort to 
Protocol MNK61062107 Amendment 4 Version 5.0  L-OPA Oral Formulation  
 
 
 
 
Page 59 
Confidential and Proprietary  
 obtain and send death certificates and autopsy reports to the sponsor or designee, or state not 
available. 
Life-Threatening Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life -threatening" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death. For example, hepatitis that r esolved without evidence of hepatic failure 
would not be considered life threatening , even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be 
fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting in angioedema of the face would not be life 
threatening , even though  angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can 
be fatal. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155555] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155556] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155557] a criterion for an AE to be serious. The following  situations 
should not be reported as SAEs:  
 A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required 
by [CONTACT_760].  
 A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112042] a routine procedure 
followed by [CONTACT_16018] (eg, stent removal after surgery). This should be recorded in 
the study file.  
 A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition that has not worsened.  
Important Medical Events  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening , or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
AEs (serious or non -serious) that commonly occur in the study population or background 
regimen will be considered anticipated events. Such events include known consequences of the 
condition under investigation (eg, symptoms, disease progression) and other events t hat may be 
common in this study population. Anticipated events are to be recorded on the eCRF and 
reported as SAEs when serious. These SAEs will not be expedited to health authorities, but 
rather, included in aggregate safety reports.

 10.3.3.  Adverse Event and Se rious Adverse Event Classifications  
The descriptions and grading scales found in CTCAE v5.0 (U.S. HHS CTCAE Version 5.0, 
2017) will be utilized for AE reporting.  
Study Drug Relatedness  
The followin g classifications should be used when evaluating the relationship of AEs or SAEs to 
study treatment  (Table 3). 
Table 3: Adverse Event Relationships  
Relationship  Definition  
Not Related  No relationship between the AE and the administration of study treatment; the AE 
cannot be explained by  [CONTACT_155612]’s clinical state.  
Unlikely Related  The current state of knowledge indicates that a relationship to study treatment is 
unlikely. 
Possibly Related  An AE that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment  to the start of the A E and follows a known response pattern to the 
suspected study treatment. The reaction might have been caused by [CONTACT_423]’s 
clinical state or concomitant  medications.  
Related The AE that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of the 
study treatment to the start of the AE and follows a known response pattern to the 
study treatment . The suspected causality  can be confirmed with a positive re -
challenge test or supporting laboratory data.  
 
Severity Assessment  
For purposes of consistency, if required, the investigator may use the severity grades presented in  
Table 4. 
Table 4: Adverse Event Severity Grades  
Grade Definition  
Grade 1 Mild AE 
Grade 2 Moderate AE  
Grade 3 Severe AE  
Grade 4 Life-threatening AE  
Grade 5 Death 
Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs. In particular, Grade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for all 
AEs and therefore will not be considered an option for grading severity of AEs; instead, death, if 
it occurs, should be recorded as the outcome of a serious AE.

 To ensure there is no co nfusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
“serious” and “severe,” which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided:  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mil d, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical importance (such as a severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is 
based on the subject/event outcome or action criteria usually a ssociated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.  
If an AE increases in severity (eg, from moderate to severe); decreases in severity (eg , changes 
from moderate to mild); or if there is a change in seriousness, a new AE will be opened, and the 
original AE will be closed. If an AE is still ongoing at the time of a subject’s completion of the 
Final Visit, the resolution/stop date and time is left blank.  
10.3.4. Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording and Reporting  
AEs and SAEs will be recorded from signing of the ICF through completion of the final visit. 
The investigator is required to record the AE or SAE regardless of the severity of the event or its 
relationship to study treatment. The investigator must follow up on all AEs and SAEs reported to 
have occurred through the final visit until the event has resolved or stabilized or at such time the 
investigator refers the subject to a nonstudy  physician. The investigator will document the further 
follow-up information in the subject’s source document.  
During the period specified above, the investigator will:  
 Record all AEs and SAEs from the signing of the ICF through the completion of the 
final visit. 
 Report all SAEs on an SAE Report Form to Mallinckrodt Global Pharmacovigilance 
or designee.  
 Report all pregnancies to Mallinckrodt Global Pharmacovigilance or designee on the 
appropriate form.  
 Submit any Expedited Safety Report or Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reaction from Mallinckrodt Global Pharmacovigilance or designee to the IRB/IEC.  
The reporting requirements for AEs are summarized in Table 5.

10.3.5. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI is an event of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or 
program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_155613]. Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand it.  These will be reported on the AE form including start date  and 
time, stop date and time, severity, relation to study drug, any action taken with the study drug, 
and outcome of the event.  
CNS or abuse-related AEs will also be considered as AESIs for this study, based on the 
recommendation of the FDA to closely monitor these events and report time of onset, duration of 
the event, dose of drug taken, severity, and outcome . The eCRF page for these AESIs will be 
designed to capt ure the above data points . Narratives for all AESIs will be prepared from the 
data reported on the eCRFs . PK values for each individual subject who experienced these AEs 
will be provided to understand if there is a temporal correlation between drug plasma levels and 
AEs. 
CNS AESIs include  somnolence, fatigue, lightheadedness, headache, dysgeusia, hypoacusis, 
disorientation, impaired memory, peripheral neuropathy, euphoria, impaired cognition, attention, 
mood, psychomotor effects, inappropriate affect, and a berrant behavior.  
The following are the abuse-related AESIs: abuse, overuse, lost/stolen/missing or unaccounted 
product, any aberrant behavior in subjects who drop out of the study supposedly due to lack of 
efficacy, lost to follow -up, noncompliance or ove rcompliance. Also, any use of a study treatment 
by [CONTACT_155614], if any.  
10.4. Pregnancy Reporting  
Certain information  regarding pregnancy , although not considered an SAE, must be recorded, 
reported, and followed up as indicated.  This includes the following:  
Subjects should not become pregnant during the study. If a female subject, or the female partner 
of a male subject , becomes  pregnant during any active treatment period, study treatment must be 
discontinued imme diately and the investigator must report the pregnancy by [CONTACT_155615] , or designee , within 24 hours of 
confirmation of a pregnancy (ie, positive serum pregnancy test result). The outcome of 
pregnancy (eg, spontaneous abortion, live birth, still birth, congenital anomalies, birth defects) 
must be reported by [CONTACT_155616] , 
or designee , within [ADDRESS_179969] be reported to Mallinckrodt Global Pharmacovigilance , or 
designee, within 24  hours of the study site  becoming aware of the follow -up information . 
10.5. Liver Safety: Suggested Actions and Follow-up Assessments  
All events of alanine aminotransferase at least 3 × the upper limit of normal ( ULN) and with 
total bilirubin  at least 2 × ULN ( greater than 35% direct bilirubin) or alanine aminotransferase at 
least 3 × ULN and INR greater than 1.5  (if INR is measured) which may indicate severe liver 
injury must be reported as an SAE as outlined in  Section 10.3.4 (excluding studies of hepatic 
impairment or cirrhosis).  
In subjects with cirrhosis  and elevated transaminases and bilirubin at baseline, subjects should be 
discontinued if their alanine aminotransferase  or total bilirubin level doubles, or if they develop 
new symptoms suggestive of drug induced liver injury (jaundice, malaise, abdominal pain, 
unexplained nausea and anorexia ) or decompensation events during the study.  
10.6. Clinical Function Scoring  
10.6.1. Conn Score  
Subjects will be assessed at screening and every day using the Conn score, to determine if they 
have a worsening in HE, indicated as an increase in their score by 1 or more grades. The Conn 
score (also known as the West Haven Criteria) is an extensively us ed grading scale for 
assessment of HE severity. It consists of a 5 -point scale (Grade 0 to 4) as follows:  
 Grade 0: no apparent personality or behavioral abnormality;  
 Grade 1: trivial lack of awareness, euphoria or anxiety; shortened attention span; 
impairment of addition or subtraction;  
 Grade 2: lethargy; disorientation for time; obvious personality change; inappropriate 
behavior;  
 Grade 3: somnolence to semi -stupor, responsive to stimuli; confused; gross 
disorientation; bizarre behavior;  
 Grade 4: coma; unab le to test mental state.  
10.6.2. HESA Score  
The HESA score will be assessed at the screening visit to assess study eligibility, and will also be 
assessed on Days 1 through 5 /ET, to determine if subjects have a worsening in their condition. 
The HESA implements objective ways of measuring the parameters of the West Haven scale. 
The HESA utilizes clinical indicators combined with validated neuropsychological tools and 
well-defined criteria for each stage ( see HESA algorithm in  Section 10.8). The use of the HESA 
is still limited and its metric characteristics have not been fully analyzed. One favorable 
characteristic of the HESA is that it identifies low grades of H E precisely.  It consists of a 5 -point 
scale (Grade 0 to 4) , with [ADDRESS_179970] severe  (Hassanein et al, 2008 ). 

Protocol MNK61062107 Amendment [ADDRESS_179971] mortality within 3 months of surgery in 
patients who had undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure and was 
subsequently found to be useful in determining prognosis and prioritizing for receipt of a liver 
transplant. MELD uses the patient’s values for serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the INR for 
prothrombin time to predict survival. It is calculated using the following formula:  
MELD = 3.78 × ln[serum bilirubin (mg/dL)] + 11.2 × ln[INR] + 9.57 × ln[serum creatinine 
(mg/dL)] + 6.43  
10.6.4. Child-Pugh Score 
Subjects will be assessed at screening and every day using the C-P score, in order to assess the 
prognosis and liver safety evaluations. The C-P score (or the Child–Turcotte–Pugh score or 
Child Criteria ) is used to assess the prognosis of chronic liver disease, mainly cirrhosis. Although 
it was originally used to predict mortality during surgery, it is now used to determine the 
prognosis, as well as the required strength of treatment and the necessity of  liver transplantation. 
The score employs [ADDRESS_179972] will be included in one of the following liver function 
subgroups based on observations and laboratory values at the baseline evaluation:  
 C-P Class A (5-6 points):  mild liver disease.  
 C-P Class B (7-9 points):  moderate liver disease.  
 C-P Class C (10-15 points) : severe liver disease.

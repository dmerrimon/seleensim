Management  
Introduction  
 
The current  opi[INVESTIGATOR_202563] a renewed  interest  in exploring non -pharmacological  
techniques  to treat post -operative  pain.  An increasing  number  of patients  are suffering from  the adverse  
effects  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_202564],  including post -operative  nausea  and vomiting,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_202565],  immunosuppression,  constipation,  and most  recently,  addiction.  In the [LOCATION_002],  over  
$600  billion is spent every  year  on opi[INVESTIGATOR_75715],  including $[ADDRESS_241674]  Aims/Goals  
 
Percutaneous  Nerve  Field Stimulation (PNFS)  is one of these recognized  methods  that ongoing  
research  has shown  to be effective  as a complementary  method of  pain  management.   While  PNFS  is 
not a novel  concept,  clinical  indications  of auricular field stimulation have  been limited in the past  due 
to requirement  of bulky,  stationary  and non- disposable  stimulators  and electrodes. These  technological

limitations  made  it difficult  to establish  the real clinical  potential  of auricular stimulation for  the 
perioperative  management  of pain in surgical  patients,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_202566].  
The NSS-2 BRIDGE  (Appendix  1) is a battery  operated  and disposable  percutaneous  auricular  nerve  field  
stimulator  (Innovative  Health  Solutions,  Versailles, IN,  [LOCATION_003]),  that was recently  cleared by [CONTACT_202584]  a Class  II Risk  Designation;  a class  which  includes  surgical drapes,  pumps  and power  
wheelchairs . The indication  for the NSS-[ADDRESS_241676] - 
operative  nausea  and vomiting;  conditions  which  are also present  following  Cesarean -Section  surgery.  
The use of the NSS-[ADDRESS_241677]  feed  and because of this are very  motivated to  
not use opi[INVESTIGATOR_202567],  allowing  us to explore  the additional  benefits  of non-  
pharmacological  complementary  pain  management techniques.  
Mechanism  of action of  the Auricular  Percutaneous  Electrical  Nerve Field  
 
The NSS-2 BRIDGE  devise allows  for stimulation  to branches  of Cranial Nerves  V, VII, IX and X, 
and the  occipi[INVESTIGATOR_202568],  identified  by [CONTACT_96202].  Such a stimulation is transmitted  to the central  
nervous  and especially  the limbic  system, which is known  to be a key component  of the central nervous  
system  response  to stress,  anxiety  and the pain  pathwa y. The nucleus  involved  by [CONTACT_202585]  (structure  involved  in the response  to fear and anxiety),  the thalamus  (structure

involved  in the management  of visceral and somatic  pain,  addiction),  the nucleus  of tractus  solitarie  
(structure  involved  in the control  blood pressure)  etc….  The stimulation of these nucleus  produces  a 
decrease  in the transmission of pain impulses  from  visceral and/or  somatic  structures  to supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_202569], a  reduction in anxiety  and control  of blood pressure  and associated  changes  of the sympathetic  
and parasympathetic  nervous  system.  
The primary  end point  will be the frequency  of patients  who experience  an excellent tolerability  
along with  a decrease  of at least  20%  in pain score.  Also  pain score  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_202570] 5 consecutive  who  underwent a C-section the month  before.  
Specific Aims  
 
Specific Aims:  
 
1. Tolerability  and feasibility  of applying the  device  following  Cesarean Section  
 
2. Look at the trend  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_202571] - Cesarean section  women  wearing  
device,  compared  to five historical  consecutive  controls  of women  who  underwent  cesarean section in 
January  2019 
Study  Design  
 
The proposed  pi[INVESTIGATOR_202572] a single -center  prospective open -label trial at the 
University  of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_202573]  (UPMC)  Magee -Womens  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The data  collected  during this  
period will  be compared  to historical controls  who  have  had elective  C-Sections  in the period  of January,  
2019.  Institutional  review  board approval  will be obtained  before  eligible  patients  are recruited and 
consented. Trial  will be registered at www.clinicaltrial.gov  before  beginning recruitm ent. 
NSS-[ADDRESS_241679] -operative  pain  control  after  their  Cesarean -Section.  Patients who  
agree  to participate  in the  trial will sign an IRB  approved Informed  Consent  Form.  
Inclusion Criteria: 
 
Over  18 years  of age 
 
Elective  Cesarean -Section Surgery  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
 
History  of active  depression,  anxiety  or catastrophizing  
Active  alcoholism or drug abuse

quality  of recovery  after  cesarean  delivery,  overall patient  satisfaction,  and patient  satisfaction related  to 
pain  management.  When the  patient  is discharged from  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  they will be asked  to complete  a 
patient  satisfaction survey.  For patients  discharged  with  the device  attached,  removal  instructions  will  
be given  to patient  to remove  and dispose  of the device  at [ADDRESS_241682] opi[INVESTIGATOR_202576] (MED)  for analysis  purposes.  
NSS-[ADDRESS_241683]  20%  in pain score. Also  pain  score  
and opi[INVESTIGATOR_202577]  [ADDRESS_241684]  patient  outcomes,  as patients  will experience  fewer  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side  
effects  (such as  respi[INVESTIGATOR_2477],  post -operative  nausea  and vomiting,  constipation and delirium,  
as well  as transfer  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_202578]).  This will also impact  clinicians  caring for post -operative  
patients,  as there  is the real potential  they  will have  fewer  conditions  to monitor  and treat as the patient  
recovers  from  surgery.  The projected number  of patients  served  by [CONTACT_202586] (5) 
enrolled  participants  at Magee -Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202579],  the data  collected from  this trial will serve  
countless  patients  and the community  at large  as physicians  strive  to move  away  from  opi[INVESTIGATOR_202580].  Data  collected  from  this pi[INVESTIGATOR_202581]  a future  proposal  to the National  
Institute of Heath  (NIH)  to fund a full-scale,  randomized , placebo -controlled  trial using the  NSS-[ADDRESS_241685]

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202583]  2019.  Other  outcome  measures  include  the incidence  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_2477],  
PONV,  constipation and length  of stay between  the study  group and historical  control  group.

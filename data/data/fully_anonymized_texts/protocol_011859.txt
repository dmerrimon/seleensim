Main changes to the protocol are summarised belo w,
Substantial changes:
1.Synopsis, Section 2.2 (Secondary  objectives of Cohort 1 and Cohort 2), Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] (Pharmacokinetic analysis)
−Rationale for change : Serum and plasma are used as matrices for PK 
analysis. Standard non compartm ent methods will not be used due to low 
volume of data
2.Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] (Potential risks MEDI4736), Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix E 
−Rationale for update : updated to reflect MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) 
Invest igational Brochure Edition 12 
3.Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] (Potential risks AZD5069 ) 
−Rationale for change : Neutropeni a/Neutrophil count decreased is 
considered expected for regulatory  purposes in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_570369], and not y et in the oncol ogy popul ation (change arising from alignment 
with the CTFG G uidelines).
4.Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] (Safet y assessments) and Sect ion 8.5.1 (Efficacy data)
−Rational for change : Addit ional sensit ivity analysis for Overall Response 
Rate was removed as it will not be conducted due to lack of meaningful 
contribution to the interpre tation of  the data
In addit ion, there are non -substantial changes made in the protocol amendment that are 
listed below. These are inclusive of administrative changes made to the amendment, 
clarifying existing protocol text and correcting existing discrepan cies between different 
sections of protocol.
Please note: Minor clerical corrections are not detailed in this Summary o f Changes

Non substantial changes:
1.Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] (Secondary  endpoints): Corrected errors in disease control rate
Version 4.0, 17 July 2017
Main changes to the protocol are summarised belo w,
Substantial changes:
1.Synopsis, Section 1.2, Section 6.7.: Language was updated to reflect the init ial 
dosing of AZD5069 at 80 mg po bid, with provisio n for dose reductions described in 
Section 6.7.3. Text throughout protocol has been updated for consistency . 
−Rationale for update : updated to reflect that the adopted current RP2D for 
AZD5069 from the D5660C00004 (SCORES) study.  The revised dosing 
scheme (previously included as Appendix F in the previous versio n of this

3(176)protocol ) is now presented in the toxicit y management section of our study  
(secti on 6.7.3).
2.Synopsis, Section 2 & Section 8: Primary objective was clarified to be inclusive o f 
safet y and tolerabilit y of MEDI4736 + AZD5069 in combination, thus separate 
safet y object ive was remo ved.
−Rationale for clarification : the protocol had originally  separated out safety  
as a separate safety  object ive. This has now been clarified that safet y is 
primary  object ive which now aligns wit h the s tatistical analysis plan for the 
study . 
3.Secti on 1.1.2: Secti on has been updated to include the most current clinical data 
available for MEDI4736.
−Rationale for change : to update background data based on updated IB 
4.Synopsis & Section 3.1:  Inclusio n criteria #3 text was simplified and Cohort 2 
progression t imeline for prior therapy was removed.
−Rationale for change : Significant simplificat ion and clarificat ion of entry  
criterion #[ADDRESS_748455] igator feedback and queries 
about eligi bility.  Limi ting the patient populat ion to PDAC patients with 
metastati c disease and a single prior line of therapy  is intended to m ake the 
patient popul ation m ore hom ogeneous.  Thi s will enhance our abilit y to 
understand the meaning of responses without compromising the primary 
endpo int in this init ially small study .  
5.Secti on 3.1, secti on 3.3, Secti on 4, Secti on 5.1: Added inclusio n criteria #9 (cohort 
2) for taking mandatory  tumor biopsy  in screening peri od (or <[ADDRESS_748456] 
dosing if adequate tissue samples are available). Text throughout protocol has been 
updated for consistency . 
−Rationale for change : this has been the intent of the original protocol but 
discrepancy  between protocol  sections has been addressed and the intent is 
reflected mor e clearly  via addi tion of  the requi rement in eligibilit y criteria 
and in schedule of procedures. 
In addit ion, there are non -substantial changes made in the protocol amendment that are 
listed below. These are inclusive of administrative changes made to the amendment, 
clarifying exist ing protocol text and correcting existing discrepancies between different 
sections of protocol.

Collect and store tumor, blood, plasma, and 
serum samples or analyse surplus blood or 
tissue including patient -specific archival tumor 
tissue, if availableSamples may be used for potential future exploratory 
research into factors that may influence development 
of the tumor or response to treatment (where response 
is defined broadly to include efficacy, tolerability, or 
safety).  In the event that additional tumor molec ular 
profiling is required to understand further any response 
to treatment, [COMPANY_008] may request a sample of the 
most recent tumor biopsy for additional research.  Any 
sample collection can be discontinued or suspended at 
the discretion of the Sponsor, without need for a 
protocol amendment.

dose escalat ion phase of  Study  D5660C00004 will be emplo yed.  This reg imen 
entails init ial dosing o f AZD5069 at 80 mg po bid with defined dose reduction 
criteria based on peripheral blood neutrophil counts.  Details o f these cri teria are 
described in Secion 6.7.3. Dosing will cont inue until confirmed PD or another 
discontinuat ion criterion is m et. 
Statistical methods
Cohort 1: First -line, Phase Ib, MEDI4736 + nab -pacli taxel + gemci tabine
Safety and tol erabilit y, and the occurrence of dose limit ing toxicit y, will be evaluated through 
adverse events (AEs), phy sical examinat ions, laboratory  and vi tal sign m easures, and 
electrocardi ogram s.  Secondary  endpo ints, including object ive response rate (ORR), duration 
of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR), and progression -free survival (PFS), will be 
summarized based on Invest igator assessments according to RECIST 1.1.  PFS, overall 
survival (OS), and DoR will be described using programmed list ings due to the cappi[INVESTIGATOR_570370] [ADDRESS_748477] ing capturing which 
patients develop detectable ant i-MEDI4736, anti -nab-pacli taxel or anti -gemci tabine 
antibodies.
PK concentration data will be listed for each patient and each dosing day.
Cohort 2: Second -line, Phase II, MEDI4736 + AZD5069
Safety and tol erabilit y will  be evaluated through adverse events (AEs), physical examinat ions, 
laboratory  and vi tal sign measures, and electrocardiograms, using summary  stati stics.  
Secondary  endpoints, including ORR, DoR, DCR, PFS, proportion of patients alive and 
progre ssion -free after 3 months (PFS3) and proportion of patients alive and progression- free 
after 6 m onths (PFS6), will be summarized based on Invest igator assessments according to 
RECIST 1.1.  PFS, PFS3, PFS6, OS, proportion of patients alive at [ADDRESS_748478] dose

27(176)1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
Pancreat ic ductal adenocarcino ma (PDAC), which accounts for more than 90% of all 
pancreat ic tumors, is a malignancy wit h an extremely poor prognosis, as shown by a 1 -year 
survival rate of around 18% for all stages of the disease and an est imated 5 -year sur vival rate 
of less than 5%.  The low survival rates associated with PDAC primarily reflect the fact that 
tumors progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_570373] (almo st 80% of patients at diagnosis ; Hidalgo et al  2015 ).
Metastatic PDAC is one of the most aggressive and highly lethal malignancies.  Although it 
constitutes only about 3% of all cancers in the Unit ed States (US), it is the fourth leading 
cause of cancer deaths in both men and wo men and is responsible for 7% of all cancer -related 
deaths.  The death rate from the disease rose fro m [ADDRESS_748496] e ([ZIP_CODE] m en and [ZIP_CODE] wom en) will die of pancreatic cancer 
(Dragovich et al 2014 ). In the absence of predisposing condit ions, such as familial pancreat ic 
cancer and chronic pancreat itis, pancreat ic cancer is unusual in persons younger than 45 years.  
After age 50 years, the frequency of pancreat ic cancer increases linearly.  The median age at 
diagnosis is 69 years in whites and 65 years in blacks; so me single -institution data reported 
from large cancer centers suggest that the median age at diagnosis in both sexes has fallen to 
63 years.
The poor prognosis reflects the limited treatment options available, highlight ing the need for 
the development of newer therapeutic options.  Very  few pat ients with truly localized disease 
can be cured by [CONTACT_44850] .  Inoperable patients som etimes undergo surgery  for symptom  relief 
(eg, by [CONTACT_514243], splanchnicectomy), but the main treatment is radiat ion and 
chemotherapy.  Radiat ion therapy  is used to control local symptoms like pain but has no 
proven effect on ov erall survival (OS )  (Thota et al 2014 ).
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_570374], there has been limited progress in therapeut ic options for 
metastati c disease.  Over the past [ADDRESS_748497] of care (SoC) for patients with 
metastati c pancreatic cancer for several years until combinat ion therapy  with gem citabine plus 
erlotinib was shown to increase median survival by  [CONTACT_3450] 2 weeks.  A Pha se III trial 
of gem citabine versus fluoropyrimidine (5-FU) as first -line therapy in patients with advanced 
or metastati c adenocarcino ma of the pancreas reported a significant improvement in survival 
among pat ients treated with gemcitabine (median survival durat ions were 5.65 and 
4.41 months for gem citabine -treated and 5 -FU-treated pati ents, respectively  [p=0.0025]).  The 
survival rate at 12 months was 18% for gem citabine pati ents and 2% for 5 -FU patients 
(Burris et al 1997 ).

28(176)The National Cancer Inst itute of Canada performed a Phase III trial (CAN -NCIC -PA3 
[[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]) that compared gemcitabine alone versus the co mbinati on of  gem citabine 
and erlotinib (100 mg/day ) for first -line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic 
pancreat ic carcino mas.  The corresponding median survival rate for patients receiving 
erlotinib was 6.2 months versus 5.9 months for patients rece iving placebo.  The 1 -year 
survival rate for patients receiving erlotinib was 23% versus 17% for patients receiving 
placebo ( Moore et al 2007).  However, the modest survival benefit was tempered by  a 
significant si de effect profile and the high cost of treatment ( Moore et al 2007 ).  Later, the 
multidrug combinat ion of leucovorin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplat in (FOLFIRINOX) 
was noted to provide an increased median survival of 4.3 months versus gemcitabine; 
however, given its side effect profile, it is available only to a select group of patients with 
advanced pancreatic cancer.  The patients were randomly  assigned to receive FOLFIRINOX 
or gem citabine.  The m edian OS was 11.1 months in th e FOLFIRINOX group compared with 
6.8 m onths in the gemcitabine group (hazard ratio [HR] for death =0.57; 95% confidence 
interval  [CI], 0.45 to 0.73; p<0.001).  Median progressio n-free survival (PFS) was 6.4 months 
in the FOLFIRINOX group and 3.3 months in the gem citabine group (HR for disease 
progression =0.47; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.59; p<0.001; Conroy et al 2011).
Recent ly,the gemci tabine plus nab -pacli taxel combinat ion was shown to increase median 
survival by  1.8 m onths, wi th increased OS at 1 and 2 y ears; adverse effects were reasonable 
and included cy topenias and peri pheral  neuropathy.  The m ulti-center, internat ional Ph ase III 
trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) included 861 patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreat ic 
adenocarcino ma.  The patients were rando mly assigned to receive gemcitabine and

for death=0.72; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.83; p<0.001).  Median PFS was 5.5 months in the

The current National Co mprehensive Cancer Network recommendat ions suggest a cceptable 
first-line chemotherapy co mbinat ions for pati ents wi th good perform ance status (i e, Eastern 
Cooperative Onco logy Group [ECOG] performance status [PS] of 0 or 1), good pain 
management, patent biliary stent, and adequate nutritional intake; these c ombinat ions include 
FOLFIRINOX, nab -pacli taxel + gemci tabine, and gem citabine plus erl otinib.  The only  
recommended first -line chemotherapy option for patients with poor PS is gemcitabine 
monotherapy .  The gui delines for choosing an appropriate treatment r egimen for patients with 
metastati c pancreatic cancer thus remain ambiguous, and in the absence of a rando mized trial 
comparing the combinat ion regimens head to head, the dilemma remains regarding 
appropriate first -line therapy for these patients.
Invariab ly, regardless of cho ice of first -line therapy, pat ients with advanced/metastati c disease 
will progress, and at that point, the cho ice of treatment beco mes considerably murkier.  
According to results from a US cooperative group trial (CALGB [ZIP_CODE]), fewer t han half o f

longer deemed appropriate candidates for further ant icancer therapy .
Current ly, there is no firmly established standard chemotherapy for patients after progression 
on first -line treatment.  A variet y of cytotoxi c agents, ei ther alone or i n combinat ion, have 
been evaluated, although primarily in the context of small single -arm or retrospective studies.  
Most regimens have been associated with median PFS in the range of 2 to 4 months, OS 
ranges between 4 and 8 months, and different response rates varying from 10% to 20%, 
highlighting the very  poor prognosi s of patients who are candidates for such treatment 
(Walker and Ko 2014 ).  Targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_514208] -refractory  setting, 
meanwhile, have produced even worse efficacy results ( Liet al 2014 , Walker and Ko 2014 ).  
The combinat ion of [ADDRESS_748498]- line FOLFIRINOX who can 
receive second -line chemotherapy after progression, gemcitabine can be considered as an 
option (NCCN Pancreatic Adenocarcino ma Guidelines ).  Despi [INVESTIGATOR_570375] e progress, enrollment 
of patients wi th pancreat ic cancer in clinical trials for all lines of treat ment shoul d be 
encouraged to further improve the systemic treatment of this disease ( Seufferlein et al 2012 ).
1.1.1 Immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_570376] , and under 
some ci rcumstances, the immune system may  control  or even eliminate tumors 
(Dunn et al 2004 ).  Studi es in m ouse m odels of transplantable tumors have demonstrated that 
manipulat ion of co -stimulatory  or co -inhibitory  signals can amplify T- cell responses against 
tumors (Peggs et al 2009).  Thi s amplificat ion may be acco mplished by  [CONTACT_27640] -inhibitory 
molecules, such as cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated anti gen 4 (CTLA -4) or programmed 
cell death 1 (PD -1), from binding wit h their ligands, B7 or B7 -homo log 1 (B7 -H1) 
(programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD -L1]).
1.1.2 MEDI4736
MEDI4736 is a human monoclonal ant ibody  (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa 
subclass that inhibit s the binding o f PD-L1 and is being developed by 
[CONTACT_38227]/MedImmune f or use in the treatment of cancer (MedImmune is a who lly owned 
subsidiary  of [COMPANY_008]; [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune will be referred to as [COMPANY_008] 
throughout this document). MEDI4736 may also be referred to by  [CONTACT_570409], non -
propri etary  name ( durvalumab) in this protocol and elsewhere. As MEDI4736 is an 
engineered mAb, it does not induce ant ibody -dependent cellular cy totoxi city or com plement -
dependent cy totoxi city.  The proposed mechanism  of action for MEDI4736 i s interference of 
the interactio n of PD -L1.
PD-L1 is frequent ly found to be expressed on many  cancers wi th a high frequency, up to 88% 
in some cancer types.  Tumors expressing PD -L1 can render cy totoxi c T lymphocy tes (CTLs) 
inact ive or nonfunctional through engagement of the inhibitory r eceptor of PD -1.  Pancreatic 
cancers that are PD -L1 posit ive have been found to have significant ly poorer 1 -year 
postoperative survival and OS compared to tumors that are PD -L1 negative ( Nomi et al 2007).

30(176)Results of several preclinical models have demonstrated that blockade of PD -1 or PD -L1, or 
the use of PD -1-deficient T cells, can result in profound immune -mediated tumor control  in 
many experimental s ystems ( Blank et al  2006 , Iwai et al 2002 , Iwai et al 2005 ).
During the l ast decade, there has been a progressively increased interest in studying the 
therapeutic potential  of immune therapy  in PDAC.  Several  lines of evidence document ing the 
immune dysfunction associated with PDAC support the hypothesis that immunotherapy can 
alter the process of carcinogenesis ( Fokaset al 2015 ).
In parti cular, preclinical and clinical studies in PDAC have indicated that blockades of 
immune checkpo ints can have a posit ive effect on ant itumor immuni ty.  In f act, PD -L1-
expressio n is direct ly related to a poore r prognosis and reduced number of tumor -infiltrat ing 
T lymphocy tes, parti cularly  cluster of differentiat ion (CD) 8(+) T cells.  mAbs against PD -L1 
or PD -[ADDRESS_748499] on murine pancreat ic cancer in vivo.  PD -L1 
blockades promoted CD8(+) T -cell infiltrat ion into the tum or and induced local immune 
activat ion.  Furtherm ore, the combinat ion of ant i-PD-L1 mAb and gemcitabine exhibited a 
significant synergist ic effect on murine pancreat ic cancer and resulted in co mplete response 
(CR) wi thout overt toxi city (Nomi et al 2007).  Available clinical data derived fro m a clinical 
trial evaluat ing a single agent showed a modest clinical act ivity together wi th a tol erable 
safet y profile, suggest ing the possibilit y to evaluate an alternat ive development strategy , such 
as combinat ion with different com pounds.
Treatment of 14 patients with PDAC wit h BMS -936559, a novel ant i-PD-L1 antibody , 
showed no response in any  of the treated patients ( Brahmer et al 2012 ).  Similarly , in a 
Phase II trial in 27 pat ients with locally advanced or metastatic PD AC receiving the 
anti-CTLA -4 agent i pi[INVESTIGATOR_125], there were no responders by  [CONTACT_570410] (RECIST), but a patient experienced a delayed response after init ial progressive 
disease (PD; Pardoll 2012 , Roy al et al  2010 ).  Preliminary  data f rom 
Study CDON-MEDI4736-1108 (ref erred to hereafter as Study  1108), a Phase I mult i-arm 
expansio n study  of MEDI4736, showed 2 partial responses (PRs) in 29 evaluable patients with 
PDAC ( Segal etal2014 ).
As an ant ibody  that bl ocks the interaction between PD -L1 and its receptors, MEDI4736 may 
relieve PD -L1-dependent immunosuppressive effects and, therefore, enhance the cytotoxic 
activit y of antitumor T cells.  This hypothesis is support ed by [CONTACT_570411] m 
other mAbs targeting the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_748500] , which provi de early  evidence of clinical 
activit y and a m anageable safet y profile ( Brahmer et al 2012 , Topalian et al 2012).  To date, 
the responses tend to be more frequent in pat ients with tumors that express PD -L1 
(PD-L1-positive), al though, importantly , responses are also seen in pat ients with tumors that 
are non/low expressors of PD -L1.

(CXCR2) antagonist.  CXCR2 was recent ly ident ified as a novel target for modulat ing tumor 
immunit y (DiMitriet al 2014 , Highfill et al 2014).  Tum or signaling of PD -1 (CD279) on 
Tcells and expansio n of myelo id-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are major mechanisms of 
tumor immune escape.  CXCR2 regulates the trafficking of MDSCs to the tumor ( Highfill et 
al 2014 ), and CXCR2 inhibit ion was found to retard tumor progression both alone and in 
combinat ion with docetaxel  (DiMitrietal2014 ).  Further, when tumor trafficking of MDSCs 
was inhibited by [CONTACT_148647]2 deficiency  anti-PD-1 treatm ent induced significant ant itumor effects 
in established tumors ( Highfill et al 2014).
Studi es have suggested that CXCR2 is expressed in various PDAC cell lines and is primarily 
involved in enhancing the proliferat ion and survival of cancer cells through the autocrine and 
paracrine effect ( Steele et al 2016 , Takamori et al 2000 ).Specifically, expressio n of CXCR2 is 
increased in later stages of PDAC, indicat ing that CXCR2 is invo lved wit h the growth and 
proliferat ion of this tumor ty pe (Hussain et al  2010 ).  Based on these findings, blocking the 
CXCR2 pathway could be used therapeut ically to enhance ant itumor immune responses in 
patients wi th PDAC. Results of mult iple nonclinical studies have supported this hypothesis, as 
well.  Bl ocking the CXCR2 complex reduced cell proliferat ion and cell invasio n of PDAC 
cells ( Wang et al 2013 ) and has also been demo nstrated to prolong survival in a state -of-the-
art GEMM model of pancreat ic cancer ( Steel e et al 2016 ).
Most recently, preliminary  data from  the dose escalat ion part the D5660C00004 t rial in solid 
tumor pati ents treated in co mbinat ion with AZD5069 and MEDI4736 has been obtained.  As

AZD5069 40 mg bid and an addit ional 12 subjects started on AZD5069 80 mg bid was 
available.    During this portion of the trial, an init ial RP2D of 80 mg po bid in co mbinat ion 
with durvalumab was agreed upon by [CONTACT_49750] y review co mmittee.    
AZD5069 was also previously  evaluated in Phase I studies invo lving heal thy volunteers, as

There have also been 2 Phase II studies in pat ients with chroni c or neutrophilic asthma.  A

malignancies, including a heterogeneous popula tion of  heavily  pretreated pati ents wi th 
pancreat ic cancer treated with MEDI4736 as monotherapy .
Chem otherapy , a m ainstay  intervent ion for cancer since the 1940s, has the potential to debulk 
the primary  tumor mass and, therefore, can be used to alter the t umor microenvironment, 
thereby [CONTACT_570412].
Although chemotherapeutic drugs induce their primary damage in many different way s, most 
of them  kill tum or cells by  [CONTACT_570413].  The massive apoptosis induced by 
[CONTACT_514248] -inflammatory mediators, such as heat -shock proteins, that act 
as danger signals and can act ivate dendrit ic cells through the toll -like receptor signaling 
pathways, thus engaging the innate immune response.  It cou ld also induce cytokine 
producti on patterns ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_570377] T -helper, ty pe I phenoty pe, thereby [CONTACT_570414] c T-cell responses ( Zwierzina 2008 ).
There i s evidence that tumor -derived ant igens induce tolerance during tumor progression.  In 
mice, for example, persistent presentation of a tumor antigen causes cytotoxic T cells that 
were once active against the ant igen to become tolerant, resul ting in tum or outgrowth.  
Interestingly , functional capacit ies are regained when T cells are transferred to an antigen -free 
environment.  The eliminat ion of persistent tolerogenic tumor antigen environment via 
chemotherapy -induced debulking may play a role in generating an effective immune response 
(Drake 2012 ).
Another way  in which cy totoxi c drugs can m ake the tum or microenvironment more conducive 
to an effect ive immune response is by [CONTACT_570415] n of tum or anti gens or m ajor 
histocompat ibilit y complex (MHC) mo lecules that have been lost during tumor progression or 
upregul ating the expressio n of costimulatory  molecules (B7 -1 and B7 -2), thereby  [CONTACT_570416].  Others (5 -fluorouracil 
and cisplat in) sensit ize tum or cells to CTL -mediated apoptosis through Fas- or

33(176)Chem otherapy , even at convent ional doses, can eliminate MDSC and Tregs, thus removing 
some of the immune suppressive factors present in cancer patients.  Cy totox ic drugs can 
modulate sy stemic mechanisms of act ive immune suppressio n or am plify expansion o f 
antigen-specific T- cell expansio n via cy toreducti on by [CONTACT_570417] ( Emens and Jaffee 2005).
Moreover, cytoreductive chemotherapy  generates a pl ethora of tum or-associated ant igens, 
which are expressed in the context of MHC mo lecul es on anti gen-present ing cells and can 
potenti ally initiate ant igen-specific T- cell activation.  Furthermore, tumors carry many 
mutati ons, and there is clear evidence that most tumors express neo -antigens against which the 
host has a capacit y to react.  Convent ional chemotherapy could unmask addit ional tumor 
neo-antigens and thus increase the amount of material available for cross -priming ( Emens and 
Jaffee 2005 ).
This immune response is driven by [CONTACT_570418], fo llowed 
by [CONTACT_514254], migrat ion to lymph nodes, and priming of tumor -specific CD8+ CTL in a 
type I interferon -dependent manner.  An antigen densit y within the tum or is an important 
determinant of the outcome of immune surveillance fo llowing chem otherapy  
(Kang et al 2013 ).
In thi s setting, immunotherapy  has the potenti al to m ount an ongoing and dynamic immune 
response that can kill tumor cells for an extended time after the conventional therapy has been 
administered.  This long -lasting response is potentially  able to com pletely  eradicate tum or 
cells rather than producing only a temporary  killing of cells, in contrast to standard 
chemotherapy.  The most promising immune -based treatments are mAbs that act as 
checkpoint inhibitors (eg, MEDI4736), adopt ive cell therapy (eg, T cells expressing chimeric 
antigen receptors), and vaccines (eg, sipuleucel -T).
CXC chemokines display pleiotropic effects in mediat ing immune response, angiogenesis, and 
metastases and deregulat ion of CXC chemokines occurs in late -stage PDAC 
(Fokaset al 2015 ).  The CXCR2 ligand, CXCL5, is overexpressed in pat ients with PDAC and 
is significant ly correlated with advanced disease stage and poor outcome.  CXCR2 -knockout 
mice harboring PDAC presented impaired recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells fro m 
bone marrow that resulted in decreased angiogenesis and tumor growth.  ( Hiraoka et al 2011 ) 
showed that the chemokine (C -X-C motif) ligand 17 (CXCL17) mediated intratumoral 
infiltrat ion of immature dendrit ic cells, while the intercellular adhesio n molecule 2 (ICAM2) 
facilitated CD8+ cell -mediated cy totoxi city and tum or cell killing.  Interestingly, during 
tumorigenesis progressi on from precursor l esions to PDAC, downregul ation of CXCL17 and 
ICAM2 tempered immune response that led to immune tolerance.  Furthermore, blockade of 
TGF -β receptor II in a mutant Kras mouse model resulted in an aggressive di sease phenoty pe 
with increased secret ion of CXCL1 and CXCL5 ligands.  Of note, CXCR2 expressio n was 
higher in stromal fibroblasts compared to epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], whereas signaling attenuation using 
a CXCR2 inhibitor decreased vessel densit y and improved surv ival in tum or-bearing mice.

34(176)Recent work from Highfill and others ( Highfill et al 2014) shows that m urine 
rhabdo myosarco ma (RMS) primarily induces the e xpansio n of granulocyt ic 
CXCR2+CD11b+Ly6GhiMDSCs, and demonstrates that CXCR2 is required for trafficking of 
these MDSCs to the tumor bed. 
In addit ion, a study  reported by  [CONTACT_570419] e et al . dem onstrated an important potential role for 
CXCR2 in pancreat ic duc tal adenocarcinom a (Steele et al 2016 ).  Thei r work dem onstrated 
that high expressio n of CXCR2 at the tumor border was associated with more rapid 
progression in 44 pat ients.  Using a genetically mo dified m ouse m odel of this disease (KPC 
mice, LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL -Trp53R172H/+; Pdx1 -Cre), these investigators further demonstrated

and gemcitabine can significant ly enhance survival.
MDSC -mediated suppression of ant itumor immunity  is a local phenom enon limited to the 
tumor bed because inhibit ion of MDSC trafficking to the tumor enhances the potency  of PD-1 
checkpoint b lockade ( Highfill  et al  2014 ).  Thi s work i dentifies CXCR2 as a new target for

immune checkpo int inhibitors with agents designed to pr event MDSC -mediated immune 
suppressio n for cancer therapy .
Based on the preliminary clinical efficacy and safety  data observed in the pancreat ic cancer 
cohort of Study  1108, this study  is being conducted to determine the safet y and tol erabili ty of 
the comb ination o f MEDI4736 with chemotherapy or novel ant icancer agents in pat ients with 
PDAC.
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups
This study  will utilize an open -label design due to the different treatment administration 
schedules and treatment durati ons.
1.2.1 MEDI4736 dose rationale
A dose of MEDI4736 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks (q4w) is supported by  [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-vitro data, 
non-clinical activit y, clinical pharmacokinet ics (PK)/ pharmacodynamics , biomarkers, and 
activit y data f rom Study 1108 in pat ients with advance d solid tum ors (ongoing first -time-
in-humans study ) and fro m a Phase I tri al perf ormed in Japanese patients with so lid tumor 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
PK/Pharmacodynamic data
Based on available PK/pharmacodynamic data from ongo ing Study 1108 with doses ranging 
from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (q2w) or 15 mg/kg every  3 weeks (q3w), MEDI4736 
exhibited non -linear (dose -dependent) PK consistent with target -mediated drug disposit ion. 
The PK approached linearit y at ≥3 mg/kg q2w, suggesting near complete target saturation 
(membrane -bound and so luble PD -L1 [sPD -L1]), and further shows that the MEDI4736 
dosing frequency  can be adapted to a parti cular regimen given the linearit y seen at hi gher

35(176)doses than 3 mg/kg. The expected half -life wi th doses ≥3 m g/kg q2w is approximately  
21days. A dose -dependent suppression in peripheral sPD -L1 was observed over the dose 
range studied, consistent with engagement of MEDI4736 with PD -L1. Dose -related changes 
in a variet y of peripheral bi omarkers have been observed over the dose range of 0.1 to 
15mg/kg. A low level o f immunogenicit y has been observed. No patients have experienced 
immune -complex disease fo llowing exposure to MEDI4736. For further informat ion on 
immunogenicit y, please see the current IB .
A population PK model was developed usi ng the data from  Study 1108 (doses=0.1 to 
10mg/kg q2w or 15 mg/kg q3w; Fairman et al 2014 ).  Mult iple simulat ions indicate that a 
similar overall exposure is expecte d following both 10 mg/kg q2w and 20 mg/kg q4w 
regimens, as represented by  [CONTACT_570420] -time curve (AUC) at 
steady  state (AUC ss) (4weeks).  Median maximum plasma concentration at steady  state 
(Cmax,ss) is expected to be higher with 20mg/kg q4w (~1.5 fold), and median trough plasma 
concentration at steady  state (C trough,ss ) is expected to be higher with 10 mg/kg q2w 
(~1.25 fold).  Clinical activit y with the 20 mg/kg q4w dosing regimen is ant icipated to be 
consistent with 10 mg/k g q2w wi th the proposed similar dose of 20 mg/kg q4w expected to 
(a)achieve complete target saturation in majorit y of patients; (b) account for anticipated 
variabilit y in PK, pharmacodynamics , and clinical activit y in diverse cancer populations; 
(c)maintain sufficient PK exposure in case o f ADA impact; and (d) achieve PK exposure that 
yielded maximal ant itumor activit y in animal models.
Given the similar AUC and modest differences in median peak and trough levels at steady  
state, the observation that both regimens maintain complete sPD -L1 suppressio n at trough, 
and the available clinical data, the 20 mg/kg q4w and 10 mg/kg q2w regimens are expected to 
have similar efficacy and safet y profiles, supporting further development with a dose of 
20mg/kg q4w.
Clinical data
Overall, cumulat ively, 765 out of 1,744 patients (43.9%) reported SAEs in the monotherapy 
programme.  The most frequently reported SOCs were Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and 
Unspecified (including Cysts And Polyps) (n = 218; 12.5%) [likely in rel ation to the

Infections and Infestations (n = 163 9.3%).  The most frequently reported SAEs were 
Dyspnoea (n=62), Pneumonia (n=53) and NSCLC (n=50) (artefact most likel y represent ing 
progressive disease rather than an SAE).  Possible immune -mediated adverse events (AEs) 
included: GI events (diarrhoea, colit is, enterit is, enterocolitis, pancreat itis and pancreat itis 
acute), endocrine events (adrenal insufficiency, hyperth yroidism, hypothy roidism, and

hepatotoxicit y, hyperbilirubinemia, liver injury  and hepat ic laboratory  abnorm ality SAEs), 
renal events (acute kidney injury , renal fail ure) and respi [INVESTIGATOR_50127] (ILD and pneumo nitis).  
Other SAEs reported were axonal neuropathy  (1), my ocardi tis (1) and tum our flare (1).

highest (> 10%) in advanced cutaneous melano ma.  Response rates to durvalumab 10 mg/kg 
IV Q2W among 30 patients with pancreat ic adenocarcino ma at more than 24 weeks of 
followup were 2/30 subjects treated (6.7%), with a disease control rate of 5/30 (16.7%). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for fixed dosing
A population PK model was developed for MEDI4736 using monotherapy data fro m 
Study 1108 (Phase I study; N=292; doses=0.1 to 10 mg/kg q2w or 15 mg/kg q3w; so lid 
tumors).  Popul ation PK analysis indicated only a minor impact of body  weight (WT) on the 
PK of MEDI4736 (coefficient of ≤0.5).  The impact of body  WT-based (10 mg/kg q2w) and 
fixed dosing (750 mg q2w) of MEDI4736 was eval uated by  [CONTACT_570421] (5th, median, and 95thpercent iles) using the populat ion PK model.  A fixed 
dose of 750 mg was selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on a median body  WT of 
approximately  75 kg).  A total  of [ADDRESS_748506] been reported by  [CONTACT_2312] ( Narwal  et al  2013 , Ng et al 2006, 
Wang etal2009 , Zhang et al 2012).  Wang and colleagues invest igated 12 mAbs and found 
that fixed and body  size-based dosing perform similarly , with fixed dosing being better for 
7of 12antibodies ( Wang et al 2009 ).  In addi tion, they  invest igated 18 therapeutic proteins 
and pept ides and showed that fixed dosing performed bet ter for 12 of 18 in terms of reducing 
the between -patient variability in PK/pharm acodynamics param eters ( Zhang et al 2012).
A fixed dosing approach is preferred by [CONTACT_72959] y due to ease of use and 
reduced dosing errors.  Given the expectation of similar PK exposure and variabilit y, 
[COMPANY_008] considered it feasible to switch to fixed dosing regimens.  Based on an average 
body  WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose o f 1.5g q4w MEDI4736 (equivalent to 20 mg/kg q4w) is 
included in the current study .
1.2.2 Rationale for combination MEDI4736 and chemotherapy (nab -paclitaxel + 
gemcitabine)

resistance.
Cytotoxi c chem otherapy  have been shown to m odulate the immune response by  [CONTACT_570423] T -cell activation via increasing the expressio n of MHC -1 
molecules ( Liu et al  2010 ), stimulating dendrit ic cell maturation ( Liu et al  2010 ), inducing 
immunogenic cell death , a form of cell death that induces dendri tic cells to stimulate tumor 
antigen presentation to T cells ( Kroemer et al 2013 ); and reducing the immunosu ppressive 
funct ion of regulatory  T cells ( Zhang et al 2008 ) and MDSCs ( Kodumudi  et al  2010 ).  
Combining MEDI4736, a PD -L1 antagonist, with cytotoxic agents, such as nab -paclit axel and 
gemcitabine, m ay provi de com plementary  benefit in m ounting an effect ive ant itumor 
immunit y by [CONTACT_570424], increasing the production of protective T 
cells and overco ming immunosuppressio n in the tumor bed ( Mellman etal2011 ).  A vari ety

treatm ent regimen for testing in treatment -naïve pati ents wi th a variet y of cancers.  
Approaches have included co mbinat ions wit h other checkpo int inhibitors (such as

chemotherapy, ant i-angiogenic inhibi tors, and sm all-molecule m olecularly  targeted the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
many with promising results and an acceptable toxicit y profile ( Philips and Atkins 2015 ).
CheckMate 012 [ClinicalTrials.gov ident ifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] i s a m ulti-arm Phase I study  of 
nivolumab with various anticancer agents or as monotherapy .  Preliminary  resul ts from 
4treatm ent arms from  this study  have been presented recent ly at the 2014 Amer ican Societ y 
of Clinical  Oncol ogy annual  meeting.
In the platinum doublet arm, where 3 plat inum -based chemotherapy regimens (cisplat in + 
gemcitabine, cisplat in + pemetrexed, and carboplatin + paclitaxel) were combined wit h 
nivolumab (n=56 patients), the ORR was 33% to 50%, 24 -week PFS 36% to 71% and 1- year 
OS was 59% to 87% ( Antonia et al  2014b ).  No DLTs were seen in the first 6 weeks of 
treatm ent, but 45% of patients had Grade 3 or 4 toxicit ies and 7% (n=4 patients) had
pneumo nitis.  Based on these preliminary results, the ant itumor activit y of first-line nivo lumab 
in combinat ion with platinum doublets is highly promising.  In the erlotinib and nivo lumab 
arm, chem otherapy -naïve patients (n=21 patients) with epi[INVESTIGATOR_294781]

Interestingly , of those wi th acqui red erl otinib resistance, 3 patients (15%) had a PR, 9 patients 
(45%) achieved stable disease (SD), and 1 patient had an unconventional immune -related 
response.  Grade 3 toxicit ies were reported in 19% of pat ients (there were no Grade 4 
toxicities).  Commo n side effects included skin rash, fat igue, parony chia, di arrhea, and skin 
fissures.  While this co mbinat ion has shown encouraging activit y, the data are preliminary and 
validat ion and comparison wi th the thi rd-generat ion EGFR t yrosine -kinase inhibitors in 
tumors harboring T790M mutations is still needed.  Further work on the interaction between 
tumors harboring T790M mutations and the tumor microenvironment and immune 
checkpoints would also be of in terest.

1.2.4 AZD5069 dose r ationale
The recommended Phase 2 dose levels (RP2D) of AZD5069 as determined in Study  
D5660C00004 (SCORES study ) will be em ployed. 
This entails init ial dosing of AZD5069 at [ADDRESS_748510] response to absolute neutrophil counts <0.5 x 109/l (referred to hereafter as 
Grade [ADDRESS_748511] ions).      
In the face of prolonged Grade [ADDRESS_748512] ions unresponsive to dose holds, use of G -
CSF is allowed twice at any  given dose l evel;   subsequent dose reductions to the next lower 
dosing level (80 mg bid 40 m g bid or 40 m g bid20 m g bid) are then mandated.  Of note, 
Grade [ADDRESS_748513] ions (ANC 0.5 -1.0 x 109/l) without clinically significant infect ion 
are tolerated within the dose reduction scheme.  
This dosing regime was developed over more than one y ear of experience treating patients in 
the SCORES trial without seri ous infect ious com plicat ions of AZD5069 neutrophil reduct ions

39(176)marrow rel ease) and not from abso lute reducti ons in the total body  pool  of granulocy tes 
available to respond to infect ious agents, the Safety Review Co mmittee in the SCORES tri al 
subsequent ly decided to enroll an addit ional cohort of up to 12 evaluable pat ients under a new 
dosing schedule for AZD5069 (80 mg bid with scheduled dose ho lds and titration for each 
patient).  Based on the absence of clinically  significan t infections in six addit ional patients and 
also on the accumulating experience wit h AZD5069 in onco logy patients, the dosing scheme 
beginning with AZD5069 [ADDRESS_748516] treatm ent cycle (no init ial 7 day run -in on AZD5069 alo ne, as in the 
D5660C00004 study ). Dosing will  cont inue until c onfirmed PD or another di scont inuat ion 
criterion is met.  
In study  D5660C00004, following a single dose administration, maximum AZD5069 plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) were observed wit h a m edian time to maximum (Tmax) occurring at 2 
hrs (range: 0.5- 8 hr). A s assessed by  [CONTACT_570426]%, there was moderate between -
subject variabilit y in Cmax and AUC, with values ranging from 31 to 46%. As the dose 
increased from 40 mg (capsule) to 80 mg (tablet), Cmax and AUC0 -8, increased by 2.9 and 
2.57 fold, respectivel y. A similar trend was observed with the metabo lite AZ13587715 PK..
In further support of the proposed dosing, a significant body  of data from  healthy volunteers 
and pulmo nary patients also describes the safet y of AZD5069 during lo ng term  
administration.  As of April 2015, AZD5069 had  been studied in 8 co mpleted Phase I clinical 
studi es in a total  of 255 heal thy volunteers, of whom 202 received AZD5069 (single doses up 
to 200 m g; multiple doses up to 80 mg bid for up to 7 days and 100 mg bid for up to 6.5 days).  
In addit ion, three major trials in pulmo nary patients were com pleted in 87 patients with COPD 
(GOLD Stage II -III) (50 mg and 80 mg bid/placebo), 52 patients with bronchiectasis (80 mg 
bid/placebo), and in a Phase II efficacy study  in 640 pati ents with persistent uncontrolled 
asthma (478 patients received AZD5069 at doses of 5 mg, 15 mg bid, or 45 mg bid, while 162 
patients received placebo for 6 months).  In the asthma trial, approximately  70% of  patients 
enrolled during the first portion of the st udy completed a planned optional 6 -month safet y 
extensio n, even though that portion of the study  was terminated early due to a lack of efficacy.  
A small study  of 4 pati ents involving comparison of neutrophils in sputum, serum, and 
bronchial t issue in pat ients wi th neutrophilic asthma has also been completed.

MEDI4736 monotherapy  and AZD5069 m onotherapy , respect ively, prior to the overall 
benefit/risk assessment.
1.3.1 Potential benefits
[IP_ADDRESS] MEDI4736
The m ajority of the safet y and efficacy data currently  available for MEDI4736 are based on 
the first time in -human, single -agent study  (Study  1108) in patients with advanced solid 
tumors.  Updated efficacy data fro m Study [ADDRESS_748517] 2014, 373 patients with all tumor ty pes 
were evaluable for response analysis, including 352 patients receiving 10 mg/kg MEDI4736 
q2w.  The DCR at 12 weeks in pat ients receiving 10 mg/kg MEDI473 6 q2w was 33%, and the 
ORR was 10%.  Greater DCR at 12 weeks (47% versus 28%) and ORR (22% versus 5%) 
were observed in PD -L1-positive versus PD- L1-negative pat ients.  Responses were ongoing in 
92% of patients, with an object ive response durat ion ranging fr om 0.1 to 32 weeks 
(Segal et al 2014 ).  Of the 29 evaluable PDAC pat ients treated in Study 1108, 2 patients had 
PRs ( Segal et al 2014 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] AZD5069
AZD5069 is being evaluated in the D5660C00004 (SCORES) trial and so far a com plete 
remission in one pat ient with a tum or type (ER+ breast cancer) that rarely  responds to PD -
(L)[ADDRESS_748518] ing efficacy has 
been documented in preclinical literature for a number of tumor ty pes (pancreat ic, 
rhabdo myosarco ma, prostate ).  Blocking the CXCR2 complex has reduced cell pro liferat ion 
and CXCR2 expressio n is increased in later stages of PDAC, so strong antagonism to this 
chemokine receptor may favorably affect host cell immune responses to PDAC tumors.  
Modest reductions in the numbers of peripheral blood neutrophils are to be expected and may 
actually prove to reflect dosing of AZD5069 at levels adequate to reduce intratumoral TANs 
and MDSCs, which have been hypothesized to play an important role in the tumor 
microenvironment , potenti ally downregulating host immune responses to malignancies as well 
as affect ing tumor cell senescence.  
Addit ional data on patients with solid tumors will be available fro m Study  D5660C00004 
prior to init iation of treatment in this study .

reacti ons and infections/serious infections. 
For informat ion on all ident ified and potential risks with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) please 
always refer to the current version of the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) IB.
In monotherapy  clinical  studi es AEs (all  grades) reported very  comm only ( ≥ 10% of pati ents) 
are fat igue, nausea, decreased appet ite, dyspnea, cough, constipation, diarrhea, vo miting, back 
pain, py rexia, asthenia, anemia, arthralgia, peripheral edema, headache, r ash, and pruritus. 
Approximately  9% of  patients experienced an AE that resulted in permanent discontinuation 
of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) and approximately 6% of patients experienced an SAE that was 
considered to be related to MEDI4736 (durvalumab) by [CONTACT_43038] y investigator.
The m ajority of treatm ent-related AEs were manageable wit h dose del ays, symptomat ic

[IP_ADDRESS] AZD5069
Ident ified risks that are currently regarded as expected terms for regulatory  reporti ng purposes 
andcomprise the reference safet y informat ion for AZD5069 are as follows:
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_570380] (non -oncology)
 Neutropenia
 Neutrophil count decreased
A reduction in blood neutrophil counts has been seen in healt hy vo lunteers and patients
participat ing in respi [INVESTIGATOR_570381]5069. Data from healt hy vo lunteers indicate a 
dose rel ated effect. The reductions in blood neutrophil counts have been asymptomatic, with 
a return to baseline values fo llowing the com pletion of the dosing regimen. In some cas es this 
reducti onin blood neutrophil counts led to neutrophil levels falling below the lower limit o f 
thelaboratory  reference range.

42(176)While reduction o f neutrophils in peripheral blood or sputum could have an impact on host 
defense wi th regard to infect ions, studies with AZD5069 in healt hy subjects, and in 
respi [INVESTIGATOR_570382], bronchiectasis, and asthma did not show an increased rate of 
overall infect ions co mpared with placebo.  The reduction in blood neutrophil counts in these 
patients was m odest in magnitude compared to that associated with cytoreductive therapeutics 
commo nly employed in oncol ogy clinics.  
Oncology indications
So far in the clinical program of AZD5069 in oncology indications, although reductions in 
peripheral  blood neutrophil  counts have been observed in the ongoing D5660C00004 trial , 
these have been non serious, reversible, and not associated with significant  clinical 
symptoms. No serious reports suggestive of neutrophil count decreased or neutropenia have 
been reported to da ta cut -off. Therefore, in the oncology indications, neutropenia/neutrophil 
count decreased is notcurrently considered expected for regulatory reporting purposes.

AZD5069, pl ease refer to the current AZD5069 IB Section 6, Summary  of data and gui dance

[IP_ADDRESS] Overall benefit and risk assessment
There rem ains a significant unmet medical need for addit ional treatment options for patients 
with metastat ic PDAC.
The combinat ion of nab -pacli taxel  + gem citabine has been approved in pat ients with newly 
diagnosed advanced pancreat ic cancer based on the data generated from the [ADDRESS_748519] trial, demonstrating a median OS of 8.5 months (95% CI, 
7.89 to 9.53) for the nab -paclitaxel + gemcitabine group compared wit h 6.7 months (95% CI, 
6.01 to 7.23) for the gemcitabine monotherapy group (HR for death =0.72; 95% CI, 0.62 to 
0.83; p<0.001).  In the nab -paclitaxel + gemcitabine group, the median durati on (range) of 
treatm ent was 3.9 months (0.1 to 21.9 months) compared with 2.8 months (0.1 to 
21.5 months) in the gemcitabine group.  The most frequently reported nonhematologic AEs 
related to treatm ent wi th the nab -pacli taxel + gemci tabin e combinati on included fat igue 
(54%), alopecia (50%), and nausea (49%).  Grade 3 or hi gher neutropeni a, leukopenia, 
fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy were reported more often in the nab -paclitaxel + 
gemcitabine group com pared wi th the gemci tabine m onother apy group.  Peri pheral  
neuropathy  was the AE with the most notable difference between the [ADDRESS_748520] patients after temporary  discontinuati on of  
nab-pacli taxel and subsequent dose reduction.  None of the patients experienced Grade 4 
peripheral  neuropathy .  The rate of discont inuat ion of nab -pacli taxel  due to peri pheral

with AZD5069 in healt hy pat ients and in pat ients with COPD and bronchiectasis did not 
shown an increased rate of overall infect ions co mpared wi th placebo.
Treatment with agents targeting PD -1/PD -L1 (such as MEDI4736) has shown act ivity in 
several tumor ty pes in a subset of patients deriving meaningful and durable benefit.  Efficacy 
data for patients treated with MEDI4736 monotherapy  in the pancreat ic cancer cohort have 
shown some clinical act ivity.  Thus, combining MEDI4736 with chemotherapy , AZD5069, or 
other agen ts may  potenti ally offer com plementary  antitumor benefit to this patient populat ion.

safet y assessment, i s in place for those risks deemed to be most likely based on pri or 
experience wit h the IPs (including MEDI4736, nab -paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and AZD5069).
No im portant ri sks have been i dentified in the human studies of AZD5069 to date.
The toxi city profile of MEDI4736 monotherapy  includes f atigue, nausea, diarrhe a, decreased 
appeti te, dyspnea, py rexia, AST or ALT increases, amylase and lipase increases, rash and 
pruri tus, and other immune- mediated reactions, which were mostly reversible and manageable 
by [CONTACT_570427].
The rati onale f or this study  is supported by  [CONTACT_570428] y data,

At screening, consent ing patients are assessed to ensure that they meet eligibilit y criteria. 
Patients who do not meet these criteria must not be enrolled in the study .  All screening and 
enrollment procedu res will be performed according to the assessment schedules in Table 2and
Table 3.
Written inform ed consent and any  locally requi red privacy  act docum ent authori zation must 
be obtained prior to performing any protocol -specific procedures, including screening/baseline 
evaluat ions.  All pat ients will be required to provide consent to supply a sample o f their tum or 
(archival or newly acquired biopsy) for entry  into this study .  For Cohort 2, tumor biopsies 
and archival t issue (the l atter only  if available) are mandatory  for entry  into the study  (see 
Table 3for details).  This consent is in cluded in the m ain pat ient inform ed consent form  
(ICF).
Screening/baseline evaluations may be performed over more than 1 visit.
The timing of ECGs and vital sign assessments should be such that it allows the blood draw 
(eg, PK blood sample) to occur at the timepo ints indi cated in Table 2through Table 5
4.2 Treatment period
All procedures to be conducted during the treatment period for both cohorts will be performed 
according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2andTable 3). 
Whenever vital signs, ECGs, and blood draws are scheduled for the same no minal t ime, the 
assessments should occur in the fo llowing order: ECG, vital signs, and then blood d raws.  The 
timing of the first 2 assessments should be such that it allows the blood draw (eg, PK blood 
sample) to occur at the timepo ints indicated in Table 2andTable 3.
4.3 Follow -up period
All procedures to be conducted during the fo llow-up period for both cohorts will be performed 
according to the assessment schedule (see Table 4andTable 5).
Whenever vital signs, ECGs, and blood draws are schedul ed for the sam e nominal  time, the 
assessments should occur in the fo llowing order: ECG, vital signs, and then blood draws.  The 
timing of the first 2 assessments should be such that it allows the blood draw (eg, PK blood 
sample) to occur at the exact no minal time. 
5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS
A Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and query 
handling.  The Invest igator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs as specified in the 
study  protocol  and in accordance with the instruct ions provided.

of the provisio n of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study  Agreement (CSA). 
The Investigator will sign the completed eCRFs.  A copy of the com pleted eCRFs will be 
archived at the study  site.
The Investi gator will record data on the observat ions, tests, and assessments specified in the 
protocol  on the eCRFs provided by [CONTACT_38227].  The CRF will be accompanied with 
“Instructi ons for th e Invest igator,” which should be fo llowed.  These instructi ons provi de 
guidance for the recording of study  data in the eCRF, including how to change data 
incorrectly  recorded.

DoR, DCR, PFS, proportion of patients alive and progression- free after 3 months (PFS3), and 
proporti on of  patients alive and progression -free after 6 months (PFS6).  The RECIST 1.1 
guidelines for m easurable, nonmeasurable, target, and non -target l esions and the obj ective 
tumor response criteria (CR, PR, SD, or PD) are presented in Appendix D.  OS, proportion of 
patients alive at 6 m onths from enro llment (OS6), and proportion of patients alive at 
12months from  enrollment (OS12) will also be evaluated.
The m ethods of assessment of tumor burden used at baseline are CT and/or MRI scans of the 
chest and abdo men; scans of the pelvis should only  be done when there i s suspected or 
docum ented di sease invo lvement.  Any other areas of disease invo lvement should be 
additionally  imaged based on the si gns and symptoms of individual pat ients.
The baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28days before start of study  
treatm ent, and i deally shoul d be performed as close as possible to the start of study  treatment.  
Efficacy for all pat ients will be assessed by  [CONTACT_570439]  8 weeks 
(q8w ±7 days; Cohort 1) or every 6 weeks (q6w ±7 day s; Cohort 2) for the first [ADDRESS_748569] infusio n, and q12w ±[ADDRESS_748570] ive 
disease progressi on.  If an unscheduled assessment is performed and the patient has not 
progressed, every  attempt shoul d be m ade to perform  the subsequent assessments at his or her 
scheduled visits.
A confirmatory  scan is required fo llowing the init ial demo nstrati on of  PD in pati ents receiving 
MEDI4736 as monotherapy  or in combinat ion with nab-paclit axel + gemci tabine or 
AZD5069; confirmat ion is not required for patients receiving nab- paclitaxel + gemcitabine or 
AZD5039 monotherapy .  The confirmatory  scan shoul d occur preferably at the next scheduled 
visit and no earlier than 4 weeks after the init ial assessment of PD in the absence of clinically 
significant deteri oration.  Treatm ent will cont inue between the init ial assessment of 
progression and confirmat ion for progression.
If a patient discontinues treatment (and/or receives a subsequent ant icancer therapy ) priorto 
progression, then the patient should st ill cont inue to be fo llowed unt il confirmed object ive

criteria of response: CR, PR, SD, and PD.  Target lesio n progression will be calculated in 
comparison to when the tumor burden was at a minimum (ie, smallest sum of diameters 
previously recorded on study ).  In the absence of progression, tumor response (CR or PR) and 
SD will be calculated in co mpar ison to the baseline tumor measurements obtained before

5.2 Safety assessments
5.2.1 Laboratory safety assessments
Blood and urine samples for determinat ion of clini cal chemistry , hematol ogy, and urinalysis 
will be taken at the times indicated in the assessment schedules and as clinically indicated (see 
Table 2through Table 5).
Clinical laboratory  safet y tests, including serum pregnancy  tests, will  be perform ed in a 
licensed clinical laboratory  according to l ocal standard procedures.  Sample tubes and sample 
sizes may  vary depending on the laboratory  method used and routine practice at the site.  
Urine pregnancy  tests m ay be perform ed at the si te using a licensed test (urine or serum 
pregnancy test).  Abnormal clinically significant laboratory resul ts shoul d be repeated as soon 
as possible (preferably  within 24 to 48 hours).
Addit ional safet y samples may  be collected if clinically indicated at the discret ion of the 
Invest igator.  The date, time of collection, and results (values, units, and ref erence ranges) will 
be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.
The l aboratory  values to be measured are presented in Table 6(clinical chemistry ) Table 7
(hematol ogy), and Table 8(urinalysis).

Appendix Cfor further instructi ons.  These cases should be reported as SAEs if, after 
evaluat ion, they  meet the cri teria for a Hy ’s Law case or if any  of the individual liver test 
param eters fulfill any of the SAE criteria.  All patients with an elevated AST, ALT, or 
bilirubin value (the latter at ≥1.5 × ULN) at the time of the last dose of study treatment should 
have a further liver chemistry  profile (AST, ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) 
perform ed 30 days (±3 days) after permanent discont inuat ion of study treatm ent.  Resul ts for 
safet y blood assessments must be available and reviewed before commencing an infusio n.
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  values shoul d be repeated as clinically  
indicated and recorded on the eCRF.  Situations in which laboratory  safet y resul ts shoul d be

body  weight m easurement.  Si tuations in which physical examinat ion resul ts shoul d be 
reported as AEs are described in Sect ion6.3.7 .
5.2.3 Electrocardiograms
Resting 12 -lead ECGs will be recorded according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2
and Table 3).  ECGs should be obtained after the patient has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_85951] 
5minutes and should be recorded while the patient remains in that posit ion.
For Cohort 1, ECGs will be recorded at screening and as clinically indicated.
For Cohort 2, 12- Lead ECGs will be recorded in triplicate at screening and day 1 of each 
treatm ent cycle. 
Abnorm al ECGs and the ECG obtained at screening will require triplicate results.  In case of 
clinically significant ECG abnormalit ies, inc luding a QTcF value >470 ms, 2 additional 
12-lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (eg, 30 minutes) to confirm 
prolongati on.  
Situations in which ECG results should be reported as AEs are described in Sect ion6.3.7 .
5.2.4 Vital signs
Vital signs (blood pressure [BP], pulse, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_41351]) will be evaluated 
according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2through Table 5)

79(176) MANDATORY: Provisio n of a tumor biopsy , formalin -fixed and embedded in 
paraffin, for the purpose of PD -L1 expressio n analyses and for enabling exploratory  
analyses (Cohort 2 only) as described in the proceeding sect ion.  A newly acquired 
tumor biopsy  is  mandatory  during screening period or taking place <45 day s before 
beginning treatment .  
Samples shoul d be collected vi a an image -guided core needle (18 gauge or larger is 
preferred).  Where inst itutional pract ice, in this setting, uses a smaller gauge needle, 
samples should be submitted in sufficient number to ensure that a valid result can be 
achieved.
When t issue is acquired for this study , effort should be made to maximi ze viable 
tumor for downstream analyses.  
Tumor lesi ons planned for biopsy  should may be used as index lesio ns for 
assessment of disease.
 Cohort 2 only , MANDATORY on treatment biopsy: on -treatm ent collection o f 
tumor biopsies are requi red if clinically  feasible at the timepo ints indicated in Table
3andTable 5. On treatment biopsy t iming may be refined with emerging PK and/or 
pharmacodynamic data during the course of the trial.  Failure to to obtain sufficient 
on-treatment tumor samples after makin g best efforts to biopsy  the tum or will  not 
be considered a protocol deviat ion.  The Investigator must consult with the Study 
Physician if such sampling is not feasible.
 Cohort 2 only , MANDATORY archived tum or tissue:  Archived tumor tissue 
(form alin-fixed , paraffin- embedded) for evaluat ion of tumor genet ics and/or tumor 
PD-L1 expression, where such samples exist in a quant ity sufficient to allow for 
analysis.
 Cohort 2 only , OPTIONAL: Tum or biopsy  at the time of progression is encouraged.  
Addit ional tumor biopsies co llected as part of clinical care (eg, for mixed responses 
or upon PD) can be submitted for further analysis.  
Tumor lesi ons planned for biopsy  should not be used as index lesio ns for 
assessment of disease.

immuno phenoty pic changes based on geno mic DNA methylat ion patterns associated with 
clinical response or treatment using nucleic acid -directed m ethods.  Changes reflect ing a 
potenti al increase in an act ive immune response, e.g. TH1 response, are likely to be a fo cus.  
Similar procedures may be co mpleted using select peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)

Soluble factors
Serum  and plasma will be obtained at bas eline and on -treatment as outlined in 3and4. The 
concentrations of a panel of cytokines and chemokines will be assessed. Focus is likely to be 
given to factors invo lved in Th1 -driven immune responses, including IFN -γ,  CXCL9, and 
CXCL10 and factors asso ciated with AZD5069 treatment (e.g. rises in CXCL8 and CXCL1). 
High pretreatm ent expressi ons (concentrati ons) of such factors m ay indicate active immune 
responses that may be augmented by  [CONTACT_570444][INVESTIGATOR_014]; correlat ions wit h 
outcom e data may ident ify pat ients likely  to receive benefi t or, al ternatively,ident ifypatients 
likely  to suffer drug -related AEs.  Plasma samples may also be used to evaluate circulat ing 
free DNA (cfDNA) as a potential pat ient selection or clinical response marker.
Serum  and plasma may  also be used for the detection/quant ificat ion of autoantibodies (against 
tumor-associated ant igens). Seroconversio n following treatm ent coul d be used as an indicator 
of overcoming tolerance.  Pretreatment seropositivit y against specific antigens m ay provide 
predi ctive value, particularly when combined wit h data regarding the presence of ant igen-
specific T cells ( Yuan et al  2011 ).  Therefore, select candidate autoantibody  measures may  be 
evaluated for associat ions wit h clinical benefit and for direct ing PBMC -based, ant igen-
directed measures as described for PBMCs abo ve.
Circulating tumor DNA
A 10mL blood sample will be taken at each of the timepo ints to provide plasma and will be 
used for the extraction and analysis o f circulat ing tumor DNA (ctDNA), for the analysis o f

6.[ADDRESS_748583].  An undesirable medical condit ion 
can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachy cardi a, enlarged liver) or the 
abnorm al resul ts of an investi gation (eg, l aboratory findings, ECG).  In clinical studies, an AE 
can include an undesirable medical condit ion occurring at any  time, including run -in or 
washout periods, even if no study  treatm ent has been administered.
The term  AE is used to include both serious and nonserious AEs.
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study  phase (i e, run -in, treatment, and washout, 
follow-up), that fulfills 1 or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
 Results in death
 Is immediately life -threatening
 Requi res in -patient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_36660]
 Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y or substantial disrupt ion of 
the abilit y to conduct normal life funct ions
 Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
 Is an important medical event th at may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
For further guidance on the definit ion of a SAE, see Appendix AAppendix A Addit ional

85(176)6.3 Recording of adverse events
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events
AEs (including AESIs) and SAEs will be collected fro m the time the informed consent is 
signed through [ADDRESS_748584] study treatment.
6.3.2 Follow -up of unresolved adverse events
During the course of the study , all AEs (including AESIs) and SAEs should be proactively 
followed up for each pat ient. Every  effort shoul d be m ade to obtain a resolut ion for all events, 
even if the events continue after discont inuat ion or study  com pletion.
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last visit in the study  are f ollowed up 
by [CONTACT_325391], but without further 
recording in the eCRF.  [COMPANY_008] retains the right to request additional 
inform ation for any  patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if 
judged to be necessary.
6.3.3 Variables
 AE (verbat im)
 The date when the AE started and stopped
 The m aximum  CTCAE grade reported
 Changes in CTCAE grade
 Whether the AE is serious or not
 Invest igator causalit y rating against the IPs (yes or no)
 Action taken with regard to IPs
 Administrati on of  treatm ent for the AE
 Whether the AE caused the patient’s withdrawal from the study  (yes or no)
 Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
 Date the AE met criteria for SAE
 Date the Invest igator became aware of the SAE
 Seriousness criteria fulfilled

86(176) Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
 Date of discharge
 Probable caus e of death
 Date of death
 Whether an autopsy  was perform ed
 Causalit y assessment in relat ion to study  procedure(s)
 Causalit y assessment in relat ion to Other Medicat ion
 Descript ion of the AE
The grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, wil l be ut ilized for all 
events with an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, 
the recommendat ion in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate, and severe events 
into CTCAE grades should be used.  A copy  of CTCAE, Versi on 4.03 can be downloaded 
from the Cancer Therapy  Evaluat ion Program websi te (http://ctep.cancer.gov).
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by [CONTACT_362028] 6.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only  a limi ted degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relat ionship between the IP and each AE and answer “yes” 
or “no” to the question, “Do y ou consi der that there i s a reasonable possibilit y that the event 
may have been caused by  [CONTACT_33159]?”
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associat ed wi th any study  procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as “yes.”
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix AAppendix A

87(176)6.3.5 Relationship to protocol procedures
The Investi gator is also required to provide an assessment of the relat ionship of SAEs to 
protocol  procedures on the SAE report form.  This includes both non -treatm ent–emergent 
(ie,SAEs that occur prior to the administration of IP) and treatment -emergent SAEs .  A 
protocol -related SAE m ay occur as a resul t of a procedure or intervention required during the 
study (eg, blood collect ion).  The fo llowing gui delines shoul d be used by  [CONTACT_570446]:
 Protocol  related: The event occurred due to a procedure or intervent ion that was 
described in the protocol for which there is no alternat ive et iology present in the 
patient’s medical record.
 Not protocol related: The event is related to an etiology other than the procedure or 
intervent ion that was described in the protocol.  The alternative etio logy must be 
docum ented in the study  patient’s medical record.
6.3.6 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_570447]: “Have you had any healt h probl ems since the previous visit/y ou 
were l ast asked?” or revealed by [CONTACT_33145].  
When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred ( when possible) to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or 
symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom 
will be recorded separately.
6.3.7 Adverse even ts based on examinations and tests
The results from protocol -mandated laboratory  tests and vi tal signs will be summarized in the 
CSR.  Deterioration, as compared to baseline, in protocol -mandated laboratory  values and 
vital signs shoul d, therefore, only be reported as AEs if they  fulfill  any of the SAE cri teria or 
if they are considered the reason for discont inuat ion of treatment with the IPs.
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or sympt om will be reported as an AE, and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion.  Wherever possible the reporting Invest igator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term  (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin v alue).  
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in nonmandated 
param eters shoul d be reported as AE(s).
Deteri oration of  a laboratory  value that i s unequivocally due to disease progression should not 
be reported as a n AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical 
examinat ion, as compared wit h the baseline assessment, will be reported as an AE.

Cases where a patient shows elevat ions in liver bio chemistry  may require f urther evaluat ion 
and occurrences o f AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN may  need 
to be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix Cfor further instruction on cases o f 
increases in liver biochemistry  and evaluat ion of Hy’s Law.
6.3.9 Disease progression
Disease progressi on can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condit ion attributable to 
the disease for which the IP is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severit y of the 
disease under study  and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of 
new, or progression of, exist ing metastasis to the primary  cancer under study shoul d be 
considered as disease progression and not a n AE.  Events that are unequivocally due to 
disease progressi on shoul d not be reported as an AE during the study .

 Death cl early  resul ting fro m disease progression should be reported to the Study  
Physician at the next monitoring visit and should be documented in the eCRF.  It 
shoul d not be reported as an SAE.
 Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progressio n of the disease under 
study , the AE causing the death must be reported to the Study  Physician as an SAE 
within 24 hours.  The report should contain a co mment regarding the 
co-involvement of PD, if appropriate, and sho uld assign m ain and contributory  
causes o f death.
 Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE.  A 
post-mortem may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if 
perform ed, a copy  of the post -mortem resul ts should be forward ed to [COMPANY_008]

the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within [ADDRESS_748588] igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, 
an autom ated email alert is sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative.
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study  site perso nnel 
reports an SAE to the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representative by [CONTACT_756].
The [COMPANY_008] representative will advise the Investigator/study  site personnel how to 
proceed.
The reference documents for definit ion of expectedness/listedness are the IB fo r MEDI4736.
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_514226] .  Amedical emergency usually constitutes an SAE 
and is to be reported as such.
6.5 Overdose
Use of IP in doses in excess of that specified in the protocol is considered to be an overdose.  
There i s currently no specific treatment in the event of overdose of IP, and possible symptoms 
of overdose are not established.
 An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagno sis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE m odules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
 An overdose without associated symptoms is only  reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module.
If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] study  drug occurs in the course of the study, then t he 
Invest igators or other site personnel should inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives 
immediately  or no later than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it.

relevant informat ion is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safet y data entry  site.
For overdoses associated with an SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply (see 
Secti on6.4).  For other overdoses, reporting must occur within [ADDRESS_748589] iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion.  Congenital 
abnorm alities/birth defect s and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  El ective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.   The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth, or congenital abnormalit y) shoul d be f ollowed up and docum ented even if the pat ient 
was discont inued from the study.
If any pregnancy  occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within [ADDRESS_748590] igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safet y data entry  site wi thin 1 or 
5calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and within [ADDRESS_748591] dose.
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, 
or congenital abnormalit y) occurring from  the date of the first dose should, if possible, be 
followed up and documented.
Where a report of pregnancy  is received, pri or to obtaining information about the pregnancy, 
the Invest igator must ob tain the consent of the patient’s partner.  Therefore, the local study

6.7 Management of IP -related toxicities
The fo llowing general guidance should be fo llowed for m anagement of toxi cities.
 Treat each of the toxicit ies with maximum supportive care (including ho lding the 
agent suspected of causing the toxicit y if required).
 If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, considerat ion should be 
given to continuing the same dose of the assigned IP alongwith appropri ate 
continuing supportive care. If medically appropriate, dose modificat ions are 
permitted.
 Alldose m odificat ions should be documented with clear reasoning and 
docum entati on of  the approach taken.
 All toxicit ies will be graded according to NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03.
6.7.1 MEDI4736
The fo llowing general guidance should be fo llowed for m anagement of toxi cities:
 Treat each of the toxicit ies with maximum supportive care (including ho lding the 
agent suspected of causing the toxicit y if required)
 If the symptoms prompt ly resolve wi th supportive care, considerat ion should be 
given to continuing the same dose of the assigned IP along wit h appropriate 
continuing supportive care. If medically appropriate, dose modificat ions are 
permitted (see Sections 6.7.2 and 6.7.3 and the Dos ing Modificat ion and Toxicit y 
Management Guidelines in Appendix E).
 All dose modificat ions should be documented with clear reasoning and 
docum entati on of  the approach taken.
In addit ion, there are certain circumstances in which MEDI4736 should be permanent ly 
discontinued (see sect ion 3.9 of this protocol and the Dosing Modificat ion and Toxicit y 
Management Guidelines in Appendix E).
Following the first dose of IP, subsequent administration of MEDI4736 can be modified based 
on toxicit ies observed as described in the Dosing Modificat ion and Toxi city Management 
Guidelines in Appendix Eof the protocol . These guidelines have been prepared by [CONTACT_570448]/her clinical judgment in treating these 
types of  toxicities. These gui delines apply to AEs considered causally  related to MEDI4736 
regimen by [CONTACT_9673].Dose reductions are not permitted. In case of doubt, the 
Invest igator should consult with the Study  Physician.

92(176)[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events of specia l interest (AESIs)
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are events of scientific and medical interest specific 
to the further understanding of the MEDI4736 safety  profile and require close monitoring and 
rapid communicat ion by [CONTACT_570449].  MEDI4736 AESIs may be serious 
or non -serious.  The rapi d reporting of these AESIs allows ongoing analysis of these events in 
order to characterize and understand them in associat ion with the use of this IP.
AESIs for MEDI4736 include but are not limited to events with a potential inflammatory or 
immune -mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or 
intervent ions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy. 
These AESIs are being clo sely monitored in clinical studies wit h MEDI4736 monotherapy  
and co mbinat ion therapy . An immune -related adverse event (irAE) is defined as an adverse 
event that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune -mediated 
mechanism o f action and where t here is no clear alternate aetio logy. Serol ogic, immunol ogic, 
and histol ogic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an irAE diagnosis. 
Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infect ious, m etabo lic, toxin, or 
other etio logic causes of the irAE.
If the Investigator has any quest ions in regards to an adverse event (AE) being an irAE, the 
Invest igator should promptly contact [CONTACT_38234].
AESIs observed with MEDI4736 include:
 Diarrhea/Co litis and intestinal perforatio n
 Pneumo nitis / ILD
 Hepati tis/transaminase increases
 Endocrinopathies (i.e. events of hypophysit is/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297], adrenal 
insufficiency, hyper -and hypothy roidism and ty pe I di abetes m ellitus)Rash / 
Derm atitis
 Nephrit is / Blood creatinine increases
 Pancreat itis / serum lipase and amylase increases My ocardi tis
 Myositis / Polymy ositis
 Neuropathy  / neurom uscular toxicit y (e.g. Guillain -Barré, and myasthenia gravis)
 Other inflammatory  responses that are rare / less frequent with a potential immune -
mediat ed aeti ology include, but are not limited to, pericardit is, sarcoidosis, uveit is 
and other events invo lving the eye, skin, haematological and rheumatological 
events.

6.7.2 Nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine
Nab-pacli taxel and gemci tabine are associ ated wi th a number of unwanted effects. In case an 
AE can reasonably  be attributed to nab -pacli taxel or gem citabine, dose adjustment shoul d be 
attem pted before adj usting the MEDI4736 dose. Management of severe and/or intolerable 
suspected adverse reactions may require dose alterations and should be performed in 
agreem ent wi th the Summary of Product Characterist ics and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l protocol  procedure.
Toxicit ies related to nab -pacli taxel  + gemci tabine treatm ent shoul d be managed as per local 
guidelines and the relevant approved labelling.
6.7.3 AZD5069
AZD5069, an inhibitor of CXCR2, acts by  [CONTACT_570450]. Therefore, 
effects on blood neutrophil count, including reductio n in their number (neutropenia), 
infect ions (especially requiring administration of outpatient oral or IV antibiot ics) are deemed 
events of special interest, as are ECG abnormalit ies occuring after treatme nt with AZD5069.
Patients will  initiate dosing of AZD5069 as 80 mg BID oral tablets.  If a patient experiences a 
clinically significant and/or unacceptable toxicit y, dosing of AZD5069 will be interrupted or 
the dose reduced with supportive therapy  administ ered as required.  For non neutropenic 
toxicities, if the toxi city resolves or reverts to a lower CTCAE grade within 21 days of onset 
and the patient is showing clinical benefit, dosing may be resumed as per Table 9and Table
10for events other than neutropenia associated with AZD5069.  If the toxicit y does not 
resolve to CTCAE gra de 2 (grade [ADDRESS_748592] ion tests) after 21 days, study treatment 
shoul d be perm anently discont inued and the patient should be fo llowed up for safet y.
A maximum of 2 dose reductions fro m 80 m g bid ( Figure 3) will be allowed for an individual 
patient.  If the dose reduction is not tolerated, study  treatm ent should be perm anent ly

8.4.1 Calculation or derivation of efficacy variables
[IP_ADDRESS] RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_748631] 1.1 overall visit response 
of CR, PR, SD, or PD depending on the stat us of their disease compared wit h baseline and 
previous assessments.  Baseline will be assessed wit hin the 28 days pri or to the treatm ent start 
date.  If a patient has had a tumor assessment that cannot be evaluated (either because the scan 
was unreadable or taken before Day  15 of  Cycle 2), the pati ent will be assigned an overall 
visit response of not evaluable (NE) unless there is evidence of progression, in which case the 
response will be assigned as PD.   Endpoints (of ORR, DoR, DCR, PFS, PFS3, and PFS6) will 
be derived from the overall visit response date and the scan dates.
Progression of TLs will be calculated in comparison to when the tumor burden was at a 
minimum (ie, smallest sum of diameters previously recorded on study , including baseline). In 
theabsence of progression, tumor response (CR, PR, SD) will be calculated in co mpar ison to 
the baseline tumor measurements obtained before starting treatment.
For TL measurements, if ≤one-third of  the TL sizes are missing then a scaling up rule will 
be applied as fo llows:
 If ≤ one -third of  all lesions recorded at baseline are missing, the results will be 
scaled up (based on the nadir sizes, including baseline) to give an est imated sum of 
diameters and this will be used in calculat ions. (This is equivalent to comparing the 
visit sum o f diameters of the nonmissing lesio ns to the nadir sum o f diameters 
excluding the lesio ns that are missing and determining at what rate the lesio ns are 
changing.)
 If > one -third of  all lesio ns recorded at baseline are missing, the TL response will be 
NE. However, if the sum of nonmissing TL diameters would result in PD (ie, if 
using a value of 0 for missing lesio ns the sum of diameters has still increased by
>20% or more compared to the smallest sum of diameters on study ); PD takes 
precedence over NE.
 Only responses of PR, SD, PD, or NE will be permitted if any o f the TL data are 
missing.

116(176)An overall visit response o f CR is defined when all TL and NTL lesio ns present at baseline 
have disappeared (with the except ion of lymph nodes which must be less than 10 mm to be 
considered nonpatho logical) and no new lesio ns have developed since baseline. An overall 
visit response of PR is defined when the sum o f diam eters of the TLs has decreased by 30% or 
more com pared to baseline (with no evidence of progression) and the NTLs are at least stable 
with no evidence o f new lesio ns.To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor 
measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_3611] 
[ADDRESS_748632] once after study  entry  at a minim um interval of not l ess than 35 day s.
When the Investigator is in doubt as to whether PD has occurred and therefore reassesses the 
patient at a l ater date, the date of the initial scan should be declared as the date of progression 
if the repeat scans confirm progression.
Please refer to Appendix Dfor the definit ions of CR, PR, SD, NE, and PD.

8.4.2 Calculation or derivation of safety variables
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events
Data from all cycles of treatment will be co mbined in the presentation of safet y data.  AEs 
(both in terms o f Medical Dictionary  for Regul atory  Activi ties [MedDRA] preferred term s 
and CTCAE grade) will be listed individually  by [CONTACT_73002].
Any AE occurring before treatment with IP will be included in the data list ings but will not be 
included in the summary  tables of AEs.  Any AE occurring within 90 days of discontinuat ion 
of IP (i e, the l ast dose of a given IP therapy ) may be included in the AE summaries, but the 
majorit y of those summaries will o mit the AEs observed after a patient has received further 
therapy  for cancer.  Further details will be provided in the SAP.  Any events in this period that 
occur after a patient has received further therapy  for cancer (fo llowing discont inuat ion of IP) 
will be flagged in the data list ings.
A separate data list ing of AEs occurring more than 90 days after discontinuation o f IP will be 
produced.  These events will not be included in AE summaries.
[IP_ADDRESS] Other significant adverse events
During the evaluat ion of the AE data, an [COMPANY_008] medically qualified expert will review 
the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs and AEs leading to discont inuat ion.  Based on 
the expert’s judgment, significant AEs of particular clinical importance may, after 
consultation wit h the Gl obal Patient Safety  Physician, be considered other significant adverse 
events (OAEs) and reported as such in the CSR.  A similar review of laboratory /vital 
signs/ECG data will be performed for ident ificat ion of OAEs.  Examples o f these are m arked

(other than those already  classifi ed as serious) or significant addit ional treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety assessments
For the change fro m baseline summaries for vital signs, laboratory  data, ECGs, and physical 
examinat ion, the baseline value will be the latest result obtained prior to the start of stud y 
treatm ent.
The QTcF will be derived during creat ion of the reporting database using the reported ECG 
values (RR and QT).
QTcF = QT/RR^ (1/3) where RR is in seconds
Corrected calcium will be derived during creat ion of the reporting database using the 
following form ulas:
Corrected calcium (mmo l/L) = Total calcium (mmol/L) + ([40 – albumin (G/L)] × 0.02)
The deno minator used in laboratory summaries will only include evaluable patients, in other 
words, those who had sufficient data to have the possibilit y of an abnormalit y.
For example:
 If a CTCAE criterion invo lves a change from Baseline, evaluable pat ients woul d 
have both [ADDRESS_748633] -dose value recorded
 If a CTCAE criterion does not consider changes from baseline, to be evaluable the 
patient need only have [ADDRESS_748634] -dose-value recorded.
The deno minator in vital signs data should include only those patients with recorded data.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary endpoints
Duration of response
DoR (per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_748635] igator assessment) will be defined as the time 
from the date of first documented response unt il the first date of documented progression or 
death in the absence of disease progression.  The end of response should co incide wit h the 
date of progression or death fro m any cause used for the RECIS T 1.[ADDRESS_748636] documented response.

programmat ically based on RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_748640] p rogression event. 
Progression -free survival (PFS)
PFS (per RECIST 1.1 using Investigator assessments) will be defined as the time fro m the 
date of first dose until the date of object ive disease progression or death (by  [CONTACT_570459]) regardl ess of whether the patient withdraws from allocated therapy  or 
receives another ant icancer therapy prior to progressio n. Pati ents who have not progressed or 
died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessm ent from 
their last eval uable RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_748641] baseline data, 
they will be censored at Day  1 unless they  die wi thin 2 visits of baseline.
The PFS time will always be derived based on scan/assessment dates not visit dates.
RECIST 1.1 assessments/scans contributing towards a particular vis it may be perform ed on 
different dates.  The fo llowing rules will be applied:
 For invest igational assessments, the date of progressio n will be determined based on 
the earliest of the RECIST assessment/scan dates of the co mponent that indicates 
progression.
 When censoring a patient for PFS, the patient will be censored at the latest of the 
dates contribut ing to a particular overall visit assessment.
Note: For target lesio ns, only the latest scan date is recorded out of all scans performed at that 
assessment for the target lesio ns, and similarly  for non -target l esions, only  the latest scan date 
is recorded out of all scans performed at that assessment for the non -target lesio ns.

regul arly scheduled imaging visit and must be no sooner than 4 weeks after the init ial 
suspected progression.  If disease progression is confirmed (or disease progression occurs and 
no further scans are recorded) then the date of progressi on will be when i t was ori ginally  
observed.  Patients with a single disease progression and no further tumor assessment scans 
will be treated as PD in the analysis.  In the absence of significant clinical deterioration, the 
investigat ional site is advised to continue the patient on study  therapy  until  progressi on has 
been confirmed.  If progression is not confirmed, the pat ient shoul d continue study  therapy  
and on -treatm ent assessments.
Proportion of patients alive and progression -free after 3 months
The PF S rate at 3 m onths (PFS3) will be calculated using Kaplan -Meier est imates.  Tumor 
progression will be determined based on Invest igator assessment and RECIST 1.1.
Proportion of patients alive and progression -free after 6 months
The PFS rate at 6 months (PFS 6) will be calculated using Kaplan -Meier est imates.  Tumor 
progression will be determined based on Invest igator assessment and RECIST 1.1.
Overall survival
OS is defined as the time fro m the date of init ial treatment until death due to any  cause.  Any  
patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last 
recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive.
Note: Survival calls will be made in the week fo llowing the date of data cut- off for the

Set.A confirmed response of CR/PR means that a response of CR/PR is recorded at [ADDRESS_748648] observed with no evidence of 
progression between the init ial and CR/PR confirmat ion visit. Therefore, data obtained up 
until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of p rogressi on, will  be 
included in the assessment of ORR. Any pat ient who discont inues treatment without 
progression, receives a subsequent therapy , and then responds will not be included as 
responders in the ORR.
The Objective Response rate (ORR) will be est imated with 95% exact CIs. The

Life threatening
“Life -threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the patient’s 
death.  “Life -threatening” does not mean th at had an AE occurred in a more severe form it 
might have caused death (eg, hepatit is that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96698] a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, b ronchospasm, laryngeal edema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33094]/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in a n 
unexpected way  during the study .
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical events may  not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094], disabilit y, or incapacit y but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_748666] drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.
Examples of such events are:
 Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
 Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_33153] l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring 
treatm ent wi th N-acetylcysteine
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
 Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusio n, etc) or 
convulsi ons that do not resul t in hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094]
 Development of drug dependency or drug abuse

136(176)A GUIDE TO INTERPRETING THE CA[LOCATION_003]LITY QUESTION
The fo llowing factors should be considered when deciding if there is a “reasonable 
possibilit y” that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
 Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the patient actually received the 
suspect drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the 
administration of the suspect drug?
 Consistency wit h known drug profile.  Was th e AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? OR coul d the AE be anticipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
 Dechallenge experience.  Did the AE reso lve or imp rove on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96699]?
 No al ternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably  explained by [CONTACT_96786], other drugs, or other host or environmental factors.
 Rechallenge experience.  Did th e AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped?  [COMPANY_008] would not normally  recommend or support 
a rechallenge.
 Laboratory  tests.  A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship?
A “reas onable possibilit y” coul d be considered to exist for an AE where [ADDRESS_748667], there would not be a “reasonable possibilit y” of causalit y if none of the 
above criteria apply or where there is evidence of exposure and a reas onable 
time course but any  dechallenge (if performed) is negat ive or ambiguous or 
there is another more likely cause of the AE.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
−Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug?
−Is there a known mechanism?
Ambiguous cases should be considered as being a “reasonable possibilit y” of a causal 
relationship unless further evidence beco mes available to refute this.  Causal relat ionship in 
cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to lack of effect should be classified 
as no reasonable possibilit y.

137(176)MEDI4736 DRUG -DRUG INTERACTIONS
There i s no information to date on drug- drug interactions wit h MEDI4736 either pre -clinically 
or in patients.  As MEDI4736 is a monoclonal ant ibody  and therefore a protein, it will be 
degraded to small pept ides and amino acids and will be eliminated by [CONTACT_72974].  It is therefore not expected that MEDI4736 will induce or 
inhibit the major drug metabo lising cytochrome P450 pat hways.  As a result, there are no 
expected pharmacokinet ic drug -drug interactions.  The mechanism o f action of MEDI4736 
involves binding to PD -L1, and therefore significant pharmacodynamic drug interactions wit h 
the commo nly administered concomitant medica tions are not expected.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], 
appropriate clinical mo nitoring in all o f the planned clinical studies will be conducted to 
evaluate any potential drug -drug interactions.

138(176)Appendix B International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) 6.[ADDRESS_748668] samples
International Airline Transportation Associat ion (IATA) classifies bio hazardous agents into 
3categori es.  For transport purposes the classificatio n of infect ious substances according to 
risk groups was removed fro m the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) in the 46th edit ion 
(2005).  Infect ious substances are now classified eithe r as Category  A, Category  B, or 
Exempt.  There is no direct relationship between Risk Groups and Categories A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, i s capable of causing permanent disa bility or life -threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwi se healt hy humans or animals.  Category  A pathogens, eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus:
 are to be packed and shipped in accordance wit h IATA Instruction 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusio n in Category  A.  Category  B pathogens are, eg, Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ty pes 1 and 2.  They  are assigned the following UN

139(176)Appendix C Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver 
Biochemistry a nd Evaluation of Hy’s Law
Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately 
report cases of Hy’s Law.  It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management 
of elevated liver biochemistries.  Specific guidance on the managing liver abnormalit ies can 
be found in Sect ion 5.2.[ADDRESS_748670] igator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets 
potenti al Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any  point during the study .
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternat ive expla nation for the el evations in liver 
biochemistry  other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by  [CONTACT_309582] (IMP). 
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting Adverse Even ts (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome 
of the review and assessment in line with standard safet y reporting processes.
Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥3 × upper limit of 
norm al (ULN) together with total bilirubin (TBL) ≥2 × ULN at any  point during the study  
following the start of study  medicat ion irrespect ive of an increase in alkaline p hosphatase 
(ALP).
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with TBL ≥2 × ULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug.
For PHL and HL to be met the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coinci dent with 
(ie, on the same day) the elevat ion in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
Identification of potential hy’s law cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  patient who m eets any  of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:

140(176) ALT ≥3×ULN
 AST ≥3×ULN
 TBL ≥2×ULN
If a central laboratory is used
When a pat ient meets any of the identificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in combination, the 
central  laboratory  will immediately  send an alert to the Invest igator (also sent to [COMPANY_008] 
representative).
The Investiga tor will also rem ain vigilant for any  local  laboratory  reports where the 
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
 Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  [CONTACT_19690]
 Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  CRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal  
local laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
 Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Appendix C for definit ion) 
by [CONTACT_96791] (including both central and 
local laboratory  resul ts)
If a local laboratory is used
The Investigator will, without delay, review each new laboratory report and if the 
identification criteria are met will:
 Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (Appendix C for definit ion) by 
[CONTACT_33156]
 Prom ptly enter the laboratory  data into the l aboratory  CRF
Follow -up
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
 Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance 
provi ded in the Clinical Study  Protocol .
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investi gator will:
 Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study  Team

141(176)The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss, and agree an 
approach for the study  patients’ follow-up and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to 
this contact [CONTACT_73016]:
 Moni tor the pati ent until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated 
 Invest igate the etio logy of the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physician. If a central laboratory  is used, this includes 
deciding which the tests available in the Hy’s law lab kit should be used.
 Com plete the 3 Live r CRF Modul es as information beco mes available 
 If at any  time (in consultat ion with the Study  Physici an) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures
Review and Assessment of potential hy’s law cases
The ins tructi ons in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
No later than [ADDRESS_748671] and TBL elevat ions, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat iveexplanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF 
accordingly and fo llow the AZ standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
 Report an SAE (report term “Hy’s Law”) according to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes.

142(176)The “Medically Important” serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessmen t of 
“related” should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
 Report an SAE (report term “Potential Hy’s Law”) applying serious criteria and 
causalit y assessment as per above
 Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to 
determine whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the 
outcom e of the review
Actions required when potential Hy’s law criteria are met before and after starting 
study treatment
This sect ion is applicable to patients with liver metastases who meet PHL criteria on study 
treatm ent having previously  met PHL cri teria at a study  visit prior to starti ng study  treatm ent.
At the first on study  treatm ent occurrence of PHL cri teria being met t he Invest igator will:
 Determine if there has been a significant change in the patients’ condit ion#
compared wi th the last visi t where PHL cri teria were m et#
If there is no significant change no action is required
If there is a significant change notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative, who will 
inform  the central  Study  Team , then foll ow the subsequent process described in 
Appendix C
# A “significant” change in the patient’s condit ion refers to a clinically  relevant change in any 
of the individual liver bioch emistry  parameters (ALT, AST, or total bilirubin) in iso lation or 
in combinat ion, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determinat ion of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the Invest igator; this 
may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any uncertaint y.

144(176)Appendix D Guidelines for Evaluation of Objective Tumor Response 
Using RECIST 1.1 Criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors)
Introduction
This appendix details the implementation o f Response Evaluat ion Cri teria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) 1.1 gu idelines ( Eisenhauer et al 2009 ) for the D4198C00003 study  with regards to 
Invest igator assessment of tumor burden including protocol -specific requirements for this 
study .
Definition of measurable, non -measurable, target an d non -target lesions
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in the study .  
Measurable disease is defined by  [CONTACT_92379] l east one m easurable (by  [CONTACT_393] 1.1) 
lesion which has not been previously irradiated.  A tumor lesi on in a previously irradiated 
field can be assessed as measurable disease provided the lesio n has been deemed to 
demonstrate progression.
Measurable:
A lesio n, not previously irradiated per the protocol prior to enrollment, that can be accurately 
measured at baseline as ≥[ADDRESS_748672] diameter (except lymph nodes which must 
have short axis ≥15 mm) with co mputed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements.  A tumor lesion in a 
previously irradiated field can be assessed as measurable disease provided the lesion has been 
deem ed to dem onstrate progression.
Non-measurable:
 All other lesio ns, including small lesio ns (lo ngest di ameter <10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥10 mm to <15 mm sh ort axi s at baseline1).
 Truly non -measurable lesio ns include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusio n, inflammatory  breast di sease, 
lymphangit ic involvement of skin or lung, abdo minal masses/abdo minal 
organ omegaly  identified by  [CONTACT_570474] m easurable by  [CONTACT_118445].
 Previously  irradiated l esions that have not dem onstrated progression2
 Brain metastasis
                                               
1Nodes with <10 mm short axis are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed as 
non-target lesions (NTLs).
2Localized post -radiatio n changes which affect lesion sizes may occur.  Therefore, lesions that have been 
previously irradia ted and have not demonstrated progression will not be considered measurable and must be 
selected as NTL at baseline and followed up as part of the NTL assessment.

145(176)Special cases:
 Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic–blast ic lesio ns, with ident ifiable so fttissue 
components, can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the 
definit ion of measurabilit y.  Bl astic lesio ns are considered non -measurable.
 Cystic met astases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for 
measur abilit y from a radi ological  point of view, but if non -cystic lesions are present 
in the same patient, these should be selected as target lesio ns (TLs).
Target lesions:
A maximum of 5 measurable lesio ns (with a maximum o f 2 lesions per organ), representativ e 
of all lesio ns involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TLs 
at baseline.
Non-target lesions:
All other lesio ns (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be ident ified as NTL at 
baseline.
Methods of assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and recorded lesion at baseline and during follow -up visits.
A summary  of the m ethods to be used for RECIST assessment is provided in Table 16, and 
those excluded fro m tumor assessments for this study  are highlighted with the rationale 
provi ded.

methods to measure TL selected for response assessment and to assess NTL and i dentificat ion 
of any new lesio ns.
In the D4198C00003 study , the methods of assessment of tumor burden used at baseline and 
follow-up visits are CT / MRI of the chest and abdomen, pelvis only  when suspected or

additionally  imaged based on the si gns and symptoms of individual pat ients.  CT examinat ion 
with intravenous contrast media administration is the preferred method.  MRI should be used 
where CT is not feasible or it is medically  contra -indicated.  For brain lesion assessment, MRI 
is the preferred method.
Clinical examination
In the D4198C00003 study , clinical examinat ion will not be used for assessment of TL.  
Clinically detected lesio ns can be selected as TLs if t hey are assessed by [CONTACT_76480].  
Clinical examinat ion can be used to assess NTL and to ident ify the presence of new lesio ns.
X-ray
Plain X- ray
In the D4198C00003 study  plain X- ray may be used as a method of assessment for bone NTL 
and to i dentify the presence o f new bone lesio ns.
Ultrasound
In the D4198C00003 study , ultrasound examinat ion will not be used for assessment of TL and 
NTL as i t is not a reproducible method, does not provide an accurate assessment of tumor size 
and it i s subjective and opera tor dependent.  Ultrasound examinat ion can, however, be used to 
ident ify the presence o f new lesio ns.  If new clinical symptoms occur and an ultrasound is 
perform ed then new l esions shoul d be confirmed by  [CONTACT_542429].
Endoscopy and laparoscopy
Inthe D4198C00003 study , endoscopy  and laparoscopy  will not be used for tumor 
assessments as they are not validated in the context of tumor assessment.
Tumor markers
In the D4198C00003 study , tum or markers will not be used for tumor response assessments as 
per RECIST 1.1.
Cytology and histology
In the D4198C00003 study  histol ogy will not be used as part of the tumor response 
assessment as per RECIST 1.1.
Isotopic bone scan
Bone l esions i dentified on an isotopic bone scan at baseline and confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], MRI, or 
X-ray at baseline should be recorded as NTL and followed by  [CONTACT_73020].
In the D4198C00003 study , isotopi c bone scans may  be used as a method of assessment to 
ident ify the presence o f new bone lesio ns at fo llow-up vi sits.  New l esions will be recorded 
where a positive hot -spot that was not present on the baseline bone scan assessment is 
ident ified on a bone scan performed at any t ime during the study .  The Invest igator should 
consider the posit ive hot -spot to be a signifi cant new si te of malignant di sease and represent

147(176)true disease progression in order to record the new lesion.  Confirmat ion by [CONTACT_4654], MRI and 
X-ray is recommended where bone scan findings are equivocal.
FDG -PET scan
In the D4198C00003 study , 18-Fluoro -deoxyglu cose posi tron emissio n tom ography  
(FDG -PET) scans may be used as a method for ident ifying new lesio ns, according with the 
following algori thm:  New l esions will be recorded where there is positive 
18-Fluoro -deoxyglucose uptake3not present on baseline FDG -PET scan or in a location 
corresponding to a new lesio n on CT/MRI at the same fo llow-up visit.  If there is no baseline 
FDG -PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesions on CT/MRI scans then fo llow-up 
CT/MRI assessments should be continued, scheduled as per protocol or clinical indicated, in 
order to confirm new lesio ns.
Tumor response evaluation
Schedule of evaluation
RECIST assessments will be performed using CT/MRI assessments of the chest and abdo men, 
and the pelvis only when suspected or when ther e is documented disease invo lvement .  
Addit ional anatomy  shoul d be imaged based on signs and symptoms of individual pat ients at 
baseline and fo llow-up.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 day s 
before the start of study  treatm ent, and ideally should be performed as close as possible to the 
start of study  treatm ent (see Table 2and Table 3of the Clinical Study  Protocol ).  Follow-up 
assessments will be performed every 8 weeks (±7 days; Cohort 1) or every  6 weeks (±7 days; 
Cohort 2) for the first [ADDRESS_748674] infusi on, and every  12 weeks 
±[ADDRESS_748675] ive disease progression.  In Cohort 1, if Day 15 
treatm ent administration is delayed due to patient toxicit y (see Clinical  Study  Protocol  
Secti on7.2.1.1), tumor assessments w ill not be altered (ie, assessments will cont inue to be 
every 8 weeks ±[ADDRESS_748676] infusio n per Table 2 of the Clinical Study  
Protocol ).
Addit ional assessments will be performed post confirmed object ive disease progression for 
patients rem aining on assigned treatment, re -treatment, or until subsequent cancer therapy  
according to the clinical study  protocol .
Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be adequately imaged at 
follow-up.
If an unscheduled assessment w as performed and the pat ient has not progressed, every  attem pt 
shoul d be made to perform  the subsequent assessments at their scheduled visit s.  Thi s 
schedule is to be fo llowed in order to minimize any  unintent ional bias caused by [CONTACT_570475] a different frequency than other patients.

lymph nodes), representative of all lesions invo lved should be ident ified as TL at baseline.  
Target l esions shoul d be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non -nodal  
lesions or short axis for nodal lesio ns), but in addit ion shoul d be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesio n 
does not l end i tself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest 
lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected.
The site and locat ion of each TL should be documented as well as the l ongest di ameter for 
non-nodal  lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes).  All measurements should be recorded in 
millimeters.  At baseline the sum o f the diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum of diameters.  At follow-up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be 
calculated and reported as the follow -up sum  of diam eters.
Special cases:
 For TL measurable in [ADDRESS_748677] diameter.  For 
pathol ogical lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short 
axis.
 If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is >5 mm, the minimum size of measurable 
disease at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan.
 If a lesio n has co mpletely disappeared, the longest diamet er shoul d be recorded as 
0mm.
 If a TL split s into two or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those 
parts. 
 If two or more TLs merge then the sum o f the diameters of the combined lesio n 
shoul d be recorded for one of the lesions and 0 mm rec orded for the other lesio n(s).  
 If a TL i s believed to be present and is faint ly seen but too sm all to measure, a 
defaul t value of 5 mm  shoul d be assi gned.  If an accurate m easure can be given, this 
shoul d be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
 If a TL ca nnot be measured accurately  due to i t being too l arge, provi de an est imate 
of the si ze of  the l esion. 
 When a TL has had any intervent ion eg, radi otherapy , embo lization, surgery , during 
the study , the si ze of the TL should st ill be provi ded where possible.

149(176)Table 17 Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all TLs since baseline.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to 
<10mm.
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% dec rease in the sum of the diameters of TL, taking 
as reference the baseline sum of diameters
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD
Progression of disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm .
Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant if any of the TLs were not assessed or not evaluable 
or had a lesion intervention at this visit.  Note: if the sum of 
diameters meets the progressive disease criteria, progressive 
disease overrides not evaluable as a TL response

Non-target lesions
Evaluation of non -target lesions
All other lesio ns (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL shoul d be i dentified as NTL at 
baseline.  Measurements are not required for these lesions, but their status should be fo llowed 
at subsequent visits.  At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL response should be 
recorded by  [CONTACT_11856].  This sect ion provi des the definit ions of the criteria used to 
determine and record overall response for NTL at the invest igational site at each visit ( Table
18).

Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all NTLs since baseline.  All lymph nodes must 
be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).
Non CR/Non PD Persistence of one or more NTL.
Progression (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing NTLs.  Unequivocal 
progr ession may be due to an important progression in one lesion 
only or in several lesions.  In all cases the progression MUST be 
clinically significant for the physician to consider changing (or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) therapy.
Not evaluable (NE) Only relevant when one or some of the NTLs were not assessed 
and, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], they are not able to provide an 
evaluable overall NTL assessment at this visit.
Note: for patients without TLs at baseline, this is relevant if any of 
the NTLs were not assessed at this visit and the progression 
criteria have not been met.
CR  Complete response; PR  Partial response; PD  Progression of disease; NE  Not evaluable; NTL  Non -target 
lesion; TL  Ta rget lesion.
To achieve “unequivocal progression” on the basis of NTLs, there must be an overall level of 
substant ial worsening in non -target disease such that, even in presence of stable disease or 
partial response in TLs, the overall tumor burden has in creased sufficient ly to merit 
discontinuat ion of therapy .  A m odest “increase” in the size of 1 or more NTLs is usually  not 
sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progressio n status.
New lesions
Details o f any new lesio ns will also be recorded with the date of assessment.  The presence of 
one or m ore new l esions is assessed as progression.
A lesio n identified at a follow up assessment in an anatomical locat ion that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease progression.
The finding of a new lesio n shoul d be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in 
scanning technique, change in imaging modalit y or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumor.
If a new lesio n is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumor 
assessments should be cont inued unt il the new lesion has been confirmed.  If repeat scans 
confirm there is a new lesio n, then the progression date should be declared using the date of 
the init ial scan.
Symptomatic deteri oration
Symptom atic deteri oration is not a descriptor of an object ive response: it is a reason for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_45806] .

Confirmation of Progression
In the D4198C00003 study , imaging for confirmat ion of response (complete response or 
partial response) shoul d be perform ed at next scheduled visit (and no less than 4 weeks) 
following the date the criteriafor response were first met.
Disease progressi on requi res confirmati on.  The confirmatory  scan shoul d occur preferably at 
the next scheduled visit and no earlier than 4 weeks afterthe init ial assessment of progression 
of disease (PD) in the absence of clinical deterioratio n.
Progression would be considered confirmed if the following criteria are met:
 ≥20% increase in the sum diameters of TLs co mpared with the nadir at

General Considerations
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management
Drug administration modifications of study drug/study regimen will be made to 
manage potential immune -related AEs based on severity of treatment -emergent 
toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03.
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/study 
regimen based on CTC grade/severity (table below), permanently discontinue 
study  drug/study regimen for the following conditions:
 Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10mg of prednisone per 
day (or equivalent) within [ADDRESS_748680] dose of study drug/study 
regimen
 Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment -related AE 
following res umption of dosing
Grade 1 No dose modification
Grade 2 Hold study drug/study regimen dose until Grade 2 resolution to 
Grade ≤1.
If toxicity worsens, then treat as Grade 3 or Grade 4.
Study  drug/study regimen can be resumed once event stabilizes to 
Grade ≤1after completion of steroid taper.
Patients with endocrinopathies who may require prolonged or 
continued steroid replacement can be retreated with study 
drug/study regimen on the following conditions:
1. The event stabilizes and is controlled.
2. The patient is clinically stable as per Investigator or treating 
physician’s clinical judgement.
3. Doses of prednisone are at ≤10mg/day or equivalent.
Grade 3 Depending on the individual toxicity, study drug/study regimen 
may be permanently discontinued. Please refer to guidelines below.
Grade 4 Permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen.It is recommended that management of immune -mediated adverse events (imAEs)
follows the guidelines presented in this table:
− It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune mediated 
mechanism could occur in nearly all organs, some of them not noted 
specifically in these guidelines.
− Whether specific immune -mediated events (and/or laboratory indicators of 
such events) are noted in these guidelines or not, patients should be 
thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative etiolo gy (e.g., disease 
progression, concomitant medications, and infections ) to a possible immune -
mediated event. In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all such events 
should be managed as if they were immune related. General 
recommendations follow.
− S ymptomatic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_62613] -grade (Grade 
1 or 2, unless otherwise specified) events.
− For persistent (>3 to 5 days) low -grade (Grade 2) or severe (Grade ≥3) 
events, promptly start prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equival ent.
− Some events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality –e.g., myo -
carditis, or other similar events even if they are not currently noted in the 
guidelines –should progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_27550] 
(methylprednisolone at 2 to 4mg/kg/day) even if the event is Grade 2, and if 
clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_27551]/or there has been clinical confirmation. 
Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician, and promptly 
pursue specialist consultation.
− If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering (28 days of 
taper), increase the corticosteroid dose (prednisone dose [ e.g., up to 2 to 
4mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent]) until stabilization or improvement of 
symptoms, then resume corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (> 28days of 
taper).
− More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors ( e.g., infliximab) 
(also refer to the individual sections of the imAEs for specific type of

154(176)Note: For Grade ≥3 asymptomatic amylase or lipase levels, hold study drug/study 
regimen, and if complete work up shows no evidence of pancreatitis, study 
drug/study regimen may be continued or resumed.
Note: Study drug/study regimen should be permanently discontinued in Grade 3 
events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality –e.g., myocarditis, or 
other similar events even if they are not currently noted in the guideline s. 
Similarly, consider whether study drug/study regimen should be permanently 
discontinued in Grade 2 events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality 
–e.g., myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are not currently noted in 
the guidel ines –when they do not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_27552] <1 upon treatment 
with sy stemic steroids and following full taper
Note: There are some exceptions to permanent discontinuation of study drug for 
Grade 4 events (i.e., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Type 1 diabetes mellitus). immunosuppressive) should be considered for events not responding to 
systemic steroids. Progression to use of more potent immunosuppressives 
should proceed more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_118387]/or mortality –e.g., myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are 
not currently noted in the guidelines –when these eve nts are not responding 
to systemic steroids.
− With long -term steroid and other immunosuppressive use, consider need for 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP, formerly known as Pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia) prophylaxis, gastrointestinal protection, and glucose 
monitoring.
− Discontinuation of study drug/study regimen is not mandated for Grade 
3/Grade 4 inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumor response 
(e.g., inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease and lymph nodes). 
Continuation of stud y drug/study regimen in this situation should be based 
upon a benefit -risk analysis for that patient.

Pediatric Considerations
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management
The criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/study regimen based on 
CTC grade/severity is the same for pediatric patients as it is for adult patients, as 
well as to permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen if unable to reduce 
corticoste roid ≤ adose equivalent to that required for corticosteroid replacement 
therapy  within [ADDRESS_748681] dose of study drug/study regimen− All recommendations for specialist consultation should occur with a 
pediatric specialist in the specialty recommended.
− The recommendations for dosing of steroids (i.e., mg/kg/day) and for IV IG 
and plasmapheresis that are provided for adult patients should also be used 
for pediatric patients.
− The infliximab 5 mg/kg IV dose recommended for adults is the same as
recommended for pediatric patients ≥ [ADDRESS_748682].
− For pediatric dosing of mycophenolate mofetil, consult with a pediatric 
specialist.
− With long -term steroid and other i mmunosuppressive use, consider need for 
PJP prophylaxis, gastrointestinal protection, and glucose monitoring.

Pneumonitis/Interstitial 
Lung Disease (ILD)Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
− Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis or 
ILD (new onset or worsening shortness of breath or cough). 
Patients should be evaluated with imaging and pulmonary 
function tests, including other diagnostic procedures as 
described below.
− Initial work -up may include clinical evaluation, monitoring of 
oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), 
laboratory work -up, and high -resolution CT scan.
Grade 1
(asymptomatic, clinical 
or diagnostic 
observations only; 
intervention not 
indicated)No dose modifications required. 
However, consider holding study 
drug/study regimen dose as clinically 
appropriate and during diagnostic work -
up for other etiologies.For Grade 1 (radiographic changes only):
− Monitor and closely follow up in 2 to 4 days for clinical 
symptoms, pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and 
laboratory work -up and then as clinically indicated.
− Consider Pulmonary and Infectious disease consult.
Grade 2
(symptomatic; medical 
intervention indicated; 
limiting instrumental 
ADL)Hold study drug/study regimen dose until 
Grade 2 resolution to Grade ≤1.
If toxicity worsens, then treat as 
Grade 3 or Grade 4.
If toxicity improves to Grade ≤1, 
then the decision to reinitiate study 
drug/study regimen will be based 
upon treating physician’s clinical 
judgment and after completion of 
steroid taper.For Grade 2 (mild to moderate new symptoms):
− Monitor symptoms daily and consider hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
− Promptly star t systemic steroids (e.g., prednisone 1 to 
2mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent).
− Reimage as clinically indicated.
− If no improvement within 3 to 5 days, additional workup 
should be considered and prompt treatment with IV 
methy lprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day star ted
− If still no improvement within 3 to 5 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_432804] 2 to 4 mg/kg/day, promptly start

(e.g., infliximab at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Caution: It is 
important to rule out sepsis and r efer to infliximab label for 
general guidance before using infliximab.
− Once the patient is improving, gradually taper steroids over

Diarrhea/Colitis Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
− Monitor for symptoms that may be related to 
diarrhea/enterocolitis (abdominal pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or changes 
in bowel habits such as increased frequency over baseline or 
blood in stool) or related to bowel perforation (such as sepsis, 
peritoneal signs, and ileus).
− Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression, other 
medic ations, or infections), including testing for clostridium 
difficile toxin, etc.
− Steroids should be considered in the absence of clear 
alternative etiology, even for low -grade events, in order to 
prevent potential progression to higher grade event.
− Use anal gesics carefully; they can mask symptoms of 
perforation and peritonitis.

Peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes
(such as Guillain -Barre 
and myasthenia gravis)Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
− The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes is important, since certain patients 
may unpredictably experience acute decompensations that 
can result in substantial morb idity or in the worst case, death. 
Special care should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms 
that may predict a more severe outcome, such as prominent 
dysphagia, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_27567], and signs of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_83741] .
− Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative 
etiology (e.g., disease progression, infections, metabolic 
syndromes or medications). It should be noted that the 
diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes can be particularly ch allenging in patients with 
underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential confounding 
effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout the neuraxis. 
Given the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is 
essential to have a low threshold to obtain a neurological 
consult.
− Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing (e.g., electromyogram 
and nerve conduction investigations, and “repetitive 
stimulation” if myasthenia is suspected) are routinely

− Sensory neur opathy/neuropathic pain may be managed by 
[CONTACT_27696] (e.g., gabapentin or duloxetine).
MYASTHENIA GRAVIS:
o Steroids may be successfully used to treat 
myasthenia gravis. It is important to consider that 
steroid therapy (especially with high doses) may 
result in transient worsening of myasthenia and 
should typi[INVESTIGATOR_27573] a monitored 
setting under supervision of a consulting 
neurologist.
o Patients unable to tolerate steroids may be 
candidates for treatment with plasmapheresis or IV
IG. Such decisions are best made in consultation 
with a neurologist, taking into account the unique 
needs of each patient.
o If myasthenia gravis -like neurotoxicity is present, 
consider starting AChE inhibitor therapy in addition 
to steroids. Such therapy, if successful, can also 
serve to reinforce the diagnosis.

171(176)− Monitor patients for signs and symp toms of myocarditis (new 
onset or worsening chest pain, arrhythmia, shortness of 
breath, peripheral edema). As some symptoms can overlap 
with lung toxicities, simultaneously evaluate for and rule out 
pulmonary toxicity as well as other causes (e.g., pulmonary  
embolism, congestive heart failure, malignant pericardial 
effusion). A Cardiology consultation should be obtained 
early , with prompt assessment of whether and when to 
complete a cardiac biopsy, including any other diagnostic 
procedures.
− Initial work -upshould include clinical evaluation, BNP, 
cardiac enzymes, ECG, echocardiogram (ECHO), monitoring 
of oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and 
additional laboratory work -up as indicated. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_545007].
− Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression, other 
medications, or infections)

 [ADDRESS_542848] introduced to the dental profession in the 1990’s.[ADDRESS_542849] aced.   Early f lowable composite res ins were 
produced by [CONTACT_428978] e 
formulation to increase flow2.  A comparison of t he filler content of these earlier flowable 
formulations were reported to b e 20 to 25% less than that of the universal composite materials1. 
Unfortunately by [CONTACT_428979]1,2. 
 
Filler content influence s the polymerization shrinkage of resin composites.  Since f iller particles, 
unlike resin, do not contract during  polymerization, increased filler content will decrease the 
polymerization shrinkage of composite resins.  In studies of experimental composites  filled with 
varying concentrations of filler particles, filler concentration was inversely correlated to shrinkage 
and shrinkage stress.3,[ADDRESS_542850] higher volumetric shrinkage5-7, 
shrinkage stress6,7 and shrinkage strain8 than more highly filled materials.  However v olumetric 
shrinkage was not corr elated to shrinkage stress for a series of commercially available flowable 
composites .7  This surprising data was explained by [CONTACT_428980] n.5 The clinical 
repercussion of polymerization shrinkage is tooth -composite marginal opening, possibly leading 
to leakage under a restoration.  In a vitro study  Bonilla  et al reported increased leakage under 
flowable com posite occlusal restorations compar ed to highly -filled composite s.9 
  
Early flowable composite s, with reduced filler content, had less flexural strength than higher filled 
conventional composite filling materials raising concerns about increased bulk fracture of flowable 
composite resin res torations.  Using an e xperimental composite made by [CONTACT_428981] 65.2vol% and nanoparticle filler content up to 40 wt% produced increased flexural 
strength.10,11  A comparative study of 72 commercially available composite s showed that flowable 
resins with higher  filler load (up to 60vol% ) had increased f lexural strength.[ADDRESS_542851] shown increased wear at  concentrations below 48vol% in one study while 
concentrations between 0 -60wt% showed no difference in wear in another.18,19  Lim et al in an in 
vitro study reported increasing nano -filler concentration up to 35vol% improved wear resistance.[ADDRESS_542852] been placed in 2 mm increments. These 
increments are added to fill the cavity due to the limited d epth of cure that the restoring 
composite had. Recently a bulk placed flowable resin composite (Filtek Bulk Fill Flowable 
Restorative, 3M E SPE) has been developed and marketed with a curing system that will allow fewer 
increments to be placed to restore th e cavity.  This composite resin has a 4mm depth of cure 
which allows fewer larger increments to be placed which shortens the tie needed to restore the 
tooth. Wear  of the composite resin is an important property for the clinical success for dental 
composite s especially for very large restorations with heavy occlusal contacts and is  especially for 
patients with heavy or abnormal occlusal function. 2,[ADDRESS_542853] effective than in vivo trials and allow quantitative 
measurement of wear.36,37  From data produced from in vitro wear resistance testing, the 3M Bulk 
Filled Flowable material has adequate wear resistance to be placed in a class II load bearing area.

Experimental Design and Methods:     
 
This clinical trial will compare three techniques using three materials (one for  each technique) for 
restoring class II preparations.  The purpose of this clinical trial is to eval uate the effectiveness of 
a flowable resin composite  (Filtek Supreme Ultra Flowable Restorative, filler  content: 65 wt% and 
46 vol%)  used in Class I I restorations compared to a conventional highly filled composite resin  
(Filtek Supreme Ultra, filler content: 72.5  wt% and 55.6  vol%) and Filtek Bulk Fill in class II 
restorations.  This is a randomized prospective single -center, single -blinded , clinical trial 36 
months in duration.  We propose using one bonding agent (Scotchbond Universal, 3M ESPE) for 
this study with a total etch technique (the enamel and the dentin are etched).  Success with 
Scotchbond Universal, using the total etch tec hnique was 100% in a 2 year44and 98% a three year45 
clinical study.   
 
Purpose: This study will examine the clinical success of 3 composite resins, a conventional 
composite (Filtek Supreme Ultra Universal Restorative,  3M ESPE) placed in 2 mm increments, a 
flowable composite resin (3M ESPE, Filtek Supreme Ultra Flowable, a flowable composite placed 
in 2mm increments) and a bulk placed and cured composite (Filtek Bulk Fill Flowable Restorative,  
3M ESPE). All composite resin restorations will be placed using a  single adhesive Scotchbond 
Universal in a three year clinical trial.    
 
Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of these three 
restorative materials placed in class II posterior restorations using Scotchbond Universal 
adhesive.  To accomplish this goal we will place [ADDRESS_542855] and 50 composite resins of each composite in Class II cavity preparations, evaluate the 
resin composite restorations used in the three techniques at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, 2 
years, and 3 years , using specific criteri a (Attachment 2).

Spec ific Aim : To place three commercially available resin composites in Class II cavity 
preparations, evaluate the resin composite restorations at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, 2  and 
3years using specific criteria (direct and indirect).  
 
Materials:  
Filtek  Supreme Ultra  Universal , 3M ESPE, placed and cured in 2 mm increments , Filtek Supreme 
Ultra Flowable  a flowable composite resin  placed and cured in 2 mm increments , and Filtek Bulk 
Fill Flowable  a composite  placed and cured in 4 mm increments will be used in this study.  All 
restorations will be placed with an adhesive, Scotchbond Universal, using a total etch technique .  
All composite s and the adhesive used in this study are in use in the US dental market at this t ime 
and are commercially available (3M ESPE website).  
 
Duration of the Investigation:   
 36 months  
 
Number of Restorations:  
At least 40 restorations are needed at 36 -month recall.  Our experience at the UAB – School 
of Dentistry Clinical Research area with dropouts over a 36 -month period is about 10%.  Fifty 
restorations will be placed to ensure ample restorations at the 36 -month recall.  
 
Class of Restorations:  
Restorations will be placed in separate preparations in Class II in upper and lower jaw molars.   
All teeth will have natural teeth or crown and bridgework as antagonists. For the clinical 
evaluation of the resin, specific criteria (Attachment 2).  will be used to evaluate, directly and 
indirectly.   
 
Distribution of Restorations:  
Sets of three restorations, one of each composite will be placed per patient for evaluation.  If 
needed by [CONTACT_428982].

 10 Materials and Methods:  
 
Digital images will be made to document the restoration size and placement at each step.  Teeth 
will be cleaned with pumice and water to remove surface stains, a shade selected and the teeth 
to be restored will be isolated with a r ubber dam. Filtek  Supreme Ultra and Filtek  Supreme Ultra 
Flowable, will be placed inserted in 2 mm increments and lighted cure using a LED curing light 
with output of 1000 -2000mW/cm2 which will be monitored to ensure irradiance greater than 
1000mW/cm2 throughout the trial.   Filtek Supreme Ultra w ill also be placed and cured in 2mm 
increments body, enamel will be cured for [ADDRESS_542857] a buccal to lingual width no greater than 1/3 the distance from buccal to lingual/palatal cusp 
tips.   All prepared margins will be placed ninety degrees to the external tooth surface.  Any tooth 
with a pul pal exposure will be excluded from the study. Any cavity preparations judged to be 
within 1mm of pulpal tissue either clinically or radiographically may be lined with Vitrebond (3M 
ESPE)  a glass ionomer  liner.  A light cured, universal bonding agent Scotc hbond Universal (3M 
ESPE, St Paul, MN) will be used for the restorations. Each composite will be placed per 
manufacturer directions. Composi -Tight (Garrison Dental) or Trident sectional matrices will be 
used with class [ADDRESS_542858] 
1000 mW/cm2. The two resin composite s (Flowable and Filtek Supreme Ultra  will be placed using 
an incremental fil l technique, beginning with a 2 mm initial increment in the gingival floor, and 
completing the restoration with 2 mm increments.  The bulk fill will be placed and cured in 4 mm 
increments. Four clinicians will insert fifty restorations.  Carbide finishing burs will be used to 
remove gross excess, followed by [CONTACT_165655] (Sof -Lex, 3M, St Paul, MN), and the Sof 
Lex Diamond Polishing System.   All polishing will be done at slow speed with water spray.  After 
removing the rubber dam , adjusting the occlusion  and polishing the restoration  a digital image 
with the articulating paper marks on the tooth will be made. An conventional impression of the 
restoration will be taken with PVS impression material (Imprint 4) in a full arch or quadr ant tray.   
 
Each restoration will be evaluated directly and indirectly  at basel ine (one week after restoration 
placement), at [ADDRESS_542859] will mark their response on a calibrated 
 
 11 line (10mm) where [ADDRESS_542860] not evaluate the restorations they placed. Additional training will also be 
obtained by [CONTACT_941] e -calib tool.  
 
 
Data Analysis:   
The categorized clinical assessment data (color, marginal disc oloration, secondary caries, 
anatomic form, marginal adaptation) will be summarized by [CONTACT_428985]. In the analysis of 
categorical data of staining, marginal int egrity, proximal contact, recurrent caries, retention, 
anatomical form and marginal adaptation, the frequency distribution over various categories will 
be calculated and reported.  A sample size of [ADDRESS_542861] one experimental composite resin 
restoration - will be evaluated for saf ety of the composite.   
 
Restoration survival at thirty -six months will be a ssessed using Kaplan -Meier survival analysis  and 
Log Rank (Mantel -Cox) test for equality.  The three groups will  compared with Kruskal -Wallis H 
test (mean rank scores, chi -square values,  degrees of freedom, and  p-values ) for each FDI criteria 
at the th irty-six month recall using SPSS  software (Microsoft).   
 
 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Modified USPHA and FDI criteria will be used to assess individual restorations.  Silicone 
impressions will be made at each recall to measure the marginal integrity and loss of anatomical 
form of each resto ration.  
 
 
 12 SUMMARY  
 
Subjects that are from 19 -90 years old will be eligible for this study.  Patients with health 
problems, who cannot tolerate the dental appointment, will be excluded.  Signs advertising the 
study will be posted in the dental school and in the local newspape r.  Up to 2 sets of three dental 
fillings for each patient will be filled with these materials in moderate sized cavities.  The patient’s 
teeth will be restored by [CONTACT_2329] a local anesthetic and a rubber sheet (rubber dam) placed over the 
prepared teeth to i solate the cavities from the patient’s saliva.  The cavities will be prepared using 
currently accepted procedures, an impression or digital scan made of the preparation and the 
resin composite filling material will be placed after applying an etchant and a dhesive to the cavity.  
The filling materials will be placed in increments according to the instructions for use. T o ensure 
that the material is set or hardened sufficiently, the curing  light (Elipar  Deep Cure S, 3M ESPE) that 
activates the polymerization reactions of the filling material.  The light will be routinely checked 
to verify it meets the curing specifications noted in the composite instructions for use.    The biting 
surface of the restorati on will be adjusted so that the patient’s teeth function the same as before 
the procedure. The restoration will be polished and an impression and digital scan of the 
completed filling will be made to record the filling at that point with and without occlus al biting 
markings.  A trained dentist will examine the patient’s fillings at [ADDRESS_542862] between adjacent teeth, and color matching with natural teeth will be recorded 
as scores according to an accepted clinical rating system.  For each category in the evaluation, 
percenta ges of alpha (perfect) scores will be tabulated.  Video images of the procedure to 
document the filling placement for at least one patient will be made

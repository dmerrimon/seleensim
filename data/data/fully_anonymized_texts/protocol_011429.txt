Toxin Type A Injection After Topi[INVESTIGATOR_41454]: Karina Richani -Reverol, MD  
Biostatistician:  Alice Z. Chuang, PhD  
Study Coordinator: Laura Baker, BS  
Population: Sample size ~14, male/female, 18 – 65 years of age, diagnosed with 
forehead rhytides electing for treatment with botulinum toxin Type A  
Number of sites: 1, Robert Cizik Eye Center  
Study Duration: Patient parti cipation time will be approximately 16 weeks  
 
 
 
Background:  
Botulinum toxin type A (BTX -A) is a potent neurotoxin that blocks the presynaptic 
acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, causing a dose -dependent 
weakness or paralysis of skeletal mu scle. Recovery of muscle function occurs through 
proximal axonal sprouting and muscle re -innervation by [CONTACT_41468] a new 
neuromuscular junction. Botulinum toxins are currently used for the treatment of a 
variety of medical disorders including spastic fac ial conditions (essential 
blepharospasms, hemifacial spasms), strabismus, sphincter dysfunction, 
hyperlacrimation, hyperhydrosis and headaches (1 -4). In addition, botulinum toxin has 
been used in the treatment of facial rhytides such as crow’s feet, and gl abellar lines with 
great aesthetic results (5, 6). More recently, the US Food and Drug Administration 
approved the use of Botox for the temporary improvement in the appearance of 
moderate to severe forehead lines associated with frontalis muscle activity i n adults.  
 
A number of factors have been postulated that may affect the efficacy and duration of 
action of botulinum toxin type A including reconstitution process, dilution (units per 
volume), storage time after reconstitution and depth of administration ( 7,8). The use of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_41455] -A for the treatment of facial cosmetic 
rythides and blepharospasm has been proposed to have a deleterious impact on BTX -A 
effect, but the data is very limited (7). Multiple studies have inv estigated the use of  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-0908 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/30/2018   topi[INVESTIGATOR_41456], topi[INVESTIGATOR_41457], vapocoolants and topi[INVESTIGATOR_41458] -A (9-12) without decreasing the 
efficacy of BTX -A. However, there is no consensus on standard of care for 
administratio n of anesthesia prior to BTX -A administration. While many surgeons use 
one or a combination of the anesthetizing methods above to decrease pain associated 
with the injection, others use none.  
 
 
OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this study is to determine whether  there is a difference in clinical effect 
(weakness/paralysis of the frontalis muscle), duration of effect, level of discomfort and 
patient satisfaction in patients receiving topi[INVESTIGATOR_41459] (2.5% lidocaine/2.5 % 
prilocaine cream, Impax Laboratories, LL C) on one side of the forehead and petrolatum 
ointment on the other prior to BTX -A administration for the treatment of forehead 
rhytides.  
 
Outcome Variables  
 Primary outcome variable is change of eyebrow excursion on each side of the 
forehead from baseline to each follow -up visit. 
 
 Secondary outcome  variables  
o Duration of effect, defined as the elapsed time from injection to the end of 
botulinum, such that return of baseline frontalis function, i.e. within 2 mm 
of baseline  value  
o Perception of pain immediately after injection at each  side 
o Patient satisfaction for each  side 
o Patient’s perception of difference in  efficacy

STUDY DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-0908 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/30/2018    
Randomization  
A computer -generated randomization table will be used to assign which side of the 
forehead receives topi[INVESTIGATOR_41460] 41% petrolatum jelly 
(placebo) prior to the BTX -A for each participant.  
 
Masking  
The randomization information wi ll only be known by [CONTACT_458] 
[INVESTIGATOR_41461].  
 
Sample Size Calculations  
This study is design to compare change of eyebrow excursion from baseline at ea ch 
side of forehead. Tzou (2005) reported that the standard deviation of eyebrow excursion 
was 2.31 mm in both European and Asian populations (16). To detect a [ADDRESS_43483] 5% significance 
level and 90% power.  
 
Recruitment period  
Recruitment for this study is anticipated to take approximately 4 -6 weeks.  
 
 
RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE  
All patients who meet eligibility criteria electing to undergo treatment with BTX -A will be 
offered this study. All patients interested will be provided with a written consent. Those 
who agree to participate, informed consent will be obtained and the parti cipant will 
proceed into the Baseline Exam.  
 
Randomization Procedure  
Upon completion of the Baseline Visit and eligibility of the participant is confirmed, their 
randomization assignment will be obtained from the computer -generated randomization 
table.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-0908 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/30/2018    
TREATMENT  
For each patient, one half of the forehead, divided from the contralateral side by [CONTACT_41470], will be treated with a thick layer 
of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 2.5% lidocaine/2.5 % prilocaine cream (Impax Laboratories, LLC), whi le the 
other will be treated with 41% petrolatum ointment. After, [ADDRESS_43484] and the forehead will be cleaned with an alcohol swab and allowed to. 
Botulinum toxin type A (Botox, Allergan Pharmaceutical, Irine, CA, [LOCATION_003]) vial s will be 
reconstituted with 0.9 % NaCl bacteriostatic solution by [CONTACT_1583] 2 ml to 100 units of 
lyophilized toxin. A 1cc syringe with a 30 -gauge 1/2 -inch needle will be used to 
administer at each site (1 syringe - needle for each side). Two units of BTX -A will be 
administered at each injection site. There will be 5 injection sites per side of forehead, 
for a total of 10 injection sites (20 units) for each participant. All injections will remain at 
least 2 cm from the superior orbital rim to reduce the potenti al of brow and eyelid ptosis.  
 
If there is toxin remaining in the vial, this will be stored/refrigerated until needed again. 
Before it is used, the cap will be cleaned off with an alcohol swab. If an open, 
reconstituted vial is not used after 48 -72 hours, the toxin will be discarded (13).  
 
Participant perception of pain at the injection site will be evaluated by [CONTACT_41471], on a scale 0 -10 for each side of the forehead (see Appendix 1).  
 
SCHEDULED STUDY VISITS AND ASSESSMENTS  
 
 
Baseline Visit  
After reviewing and signing the informed consent form, all potential participants will 
undergo a baseline evaluation in order to determine study eligibility, establish baseline 
ocular characteristics and determine randomization group based o n the computer - 
generated assignment. Participant demographics including age, gender, and race will 
be recorded as well as medical and medication history which will include previous use 
of botulinum toxin and if so the location of the injection and the dat e.

Exophthalmometry  
The distance between both lateral canthi will be measured using a Hertel 
exophthalmometer (mm) at Baseline, Week 2, Week [ADDRESS_43486] above the brow, 
parallel to the center of the pupil while the participants is in a relaxed neutral 
expression. Then, the participa nt will then be asked to raise the brows and the 
excursion of the brow from resting position to maximum elevation will be measured in 
millimeters.  
 
External Photography  
Patients will be photographed at Baseline, Week 2, Week 6, and Week 16 Visits. 
Photos w ill be taken using the same digital camera. Patients will be photographed in 
both a relaxed, neutral expression, and while exhibiting maximal voluntary eyebrow 
elevation.  All photos will be transferred to Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, INC).  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-0908 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/30/2018   The method described previously by [CONTACT_41472]. (8) will be used to assess eyebrow 
height. The lateral intercanthal distance will be measured to standardize the photos by 
[CONTACT_740] a horizontal line from one lateral canthus to the other. Baseline brow heig ht will 
be obtained measuring the distance between the line and a point taken at the superior - 
most aspect of the eyebrow, positioned directly above the mid -pupi[INVESTIGATOR_41462].  
Measurements will be made at 150% magnification, viewing images on and Mac OS 
High Sierra Version 10.13.3 with a 15 -in display and a screen resolution of 1920 x 1200 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_41463]. The lateral intercanthal distance will be used to normalize the brow eight from 
each photograph to account for any differences in the camera -to-patient distance. For  
each patient, the ratio brow height to intercanthal distance will be calculated. Then the 
ratio obtained during the neutral brow position will be subtracted from that measure 
during active brow elevation for both sides (pretreatment with anesthetic and 
petrolatum) to yield brow elevation. This will be calculated for each pi[INVESTIGATOR_41464].  
 
Participant Appearance Satisfaction Survey  
Participant satisfaction survey will be conducted at Week 2, Week 6 and Week 16 
Visits. The survey will include questions about the overall appearance of their forehead 
for each side and will be recorded using a 5 -point rating scale: 4 = very satisfied, 3 = 
satisfied, 2 = neutral, 1 = dissatisfied and 0 = very dissatisfied. Participants will also be 
asked if there is a noticeable difference between the 2 sides of their face.  
 
Universal Pain Scale Assessment  
Participant pain and/or discomfort will be assessed on the day of Injection (post 
injection) (Appendix 1) for each side.  
 
ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who is 
administered a test article. The AE do es not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
the treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-0908 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/30/2018   an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with study 
treatments.  
A non -serious AE is defined as a change in a participant’s ophthalmic and/or medical 
health that is not life -threatening, does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], does not prolong a 
current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41465]. All AEs must be reported whether they are 
considered study -related or not.  
 
 
Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is defined as any adverse experience occurring at any time 
during the study that results in:  
 Death  
 Life-threatening  
 Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Prolongation of existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543]  
 Disability or permanent damage (including vision threatening  complications)  
 A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
 Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage and/or 
other serious important medical  events  
 
All SAEs will be submitted to the IRB pursuant to their IRB policy.  
 
 
Recording Instructions  
Mild, moderate, or severe should be used to describe the maximum intensity of the 
adverse event.  
 Mild – Does not interfere with the participant’s usual  functions  
 Moderate – Interferes to some extent with the participant’s usual  functions  
 Severe – Interferes significantly with the participant’s usual  functions  
It should be noted that a severe intensity does not necessarily mean it is an SAE.

Data Analysis  
Data will be summarized by [CONTACT_8477] (SD) and c ompared for continuous variables, e.g. 
age, eyebrow excursion, etc., and frequency (%) for discrete variables, e.g. sex, end of 
effect at each follow up, etc. Eyebrow excursion and patient satisfaction at each follow 
up as well as duration of effect and pa in score will be compared between the topi[INVESTIGATOR_41466] -pretreatment groups using paired t -test; while percent of 
end of effect at each follow -up visit, rate of complications and subjective pain will be 
compared using McNemar test.

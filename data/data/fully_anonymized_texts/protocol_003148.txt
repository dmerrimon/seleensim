Functional Constipation . 
Objective s The objective s are to assess the efficacy  and safety  of the Vibrant capsule 
administered 5 times per week   
Design  The study is a prospective, adaptive, multicenter,  randomized, double -blind , 
Sham -controlled study, to evaluate the  efficacy and safety  of the Vibrant 
Capsule in relieving constipation in subjects with functional constipation. 
 
Two arms  will be assessed:   
- Vibrant Capsule administered [ADDRESS_247845] 120 evaluable subjects 
will complete  the study. The following parameters will be assessed: primary 
endpoint, tolerability and main safety  parameters .  
 Depending on the results of the interim analyis:  
• The study will be stopped, 
• The study will continue as planned,  
• The sample size will be increased . 
 Subject s will be follow ed continuously for an  approximatively 2  week run -
in  period and then will be randomized to either Vibrant or Sham capsules  
for a treatment period of 8 weeks . 
Data reporting will be done on an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and 
an eDiary.  
Subject s will be asked to refrain from taking any medication or supplement 
to relieve their constipation , during the entire study period except as allowed 
under the protocol .  
After the run -in period, the subject s will re turn and e ligibility will be re -
assessed . Subject s will be trained on how to use the base unit  and will 
swallow the first capsule on site the day of baseline visit. They will activate and ingest the rest of the capsules at hom e by [CONTACT_1029], using the base 
unit.  
Subject s will be instructed to complete a simple subject  eDiary each day 
throughout the duration of the study. A  final visit will take place at the end 
of the 8 week  treatment  period.

Sample size:  
A sample size is calculated to test both null hypothes es. Calculations 
(using SAS ® proc power) show that a sample size of a total of 214 
subjects (107 in each arm), would provide 80% power at a studywise 5% 
level of significance, i.e.  2.5% for each one of the two primary endpoints) 
, to detect a difference of 20% in the success rate, assuming a success rate 
of 25% in the sham arm. 
The sample size will be increased to at least 238 subjects (119 in each 
arm) to account for a potential 10% of drop-outs.  Major Efficacy Analyses:  
The subject’s CSBM1 success status (i.e. if the subjects achieve an 
increase from baseline of at least [ADDRESS_247851] 6 out of the 8 treatment weeks) will be modeled and compared between the study 
arm with a logistic regression model, with the baseline weekly number of CSBM and site as covariates. The adjusted success rate per study arm, and their difference between the groups will be 
presented along with their 
respective 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).  
The CSBM2 success rate will be analyzed in the same manner.  
The SBM success rate will be analyzed a similar manner.

5. INTRODUCTION  
 
This document is a clinical research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol, standards of Good Clinical Practices and associated regulations, and all applicable research requirements.  
6. BACKGROUND  
 
Chronic constipation is a common gastrointestinal disorder in the general population. It is 
estimated that chronic constipation affects between 2 and 27% of the population. A majority of chronic constipation sufferers are women, who represent three -fourths  of 
those affected
1. 
Constipation may be primary (Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC), Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS -C)) or secondary to other factors (such as drugs like 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], colorectal cancer, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease or spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828]). It i s 
estimated that 100 million adults in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) have chronic pain
2.  
There is no widely accepted definition of chronic constipation. Although physicians often define constipation based on stool frequency, subject s experience constipation as a multi -
symptom disorder that includes infrequent bowel movements, hard or lumpy stool s, 
straining, bloating, a feeling of incomplete evacuation after a bowel movement and abdominal discomfort
3. The Rome Foundation has created symptom -based diagnostic 
criteria for chronic constipation. To meet the definition of chronic constipation, the criteria must be fulfilled for the prior [ADDRESS_247852] 
costs of IBS to range from approximately $1,600 to $7,[ADDRESS_247853] costs of CIC range from approximately $1,900 to $7,[ADDRESS_247854]  
symptoms and preferences.

The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) has established a treatment 
algorithm for constipation that provides multiple therapeutic steps depending on severity of symptoms.  See http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(12)[ZIP_CODE]-4/pdf
. The 
first step in the treatment of constipation focuses on lifestyle modification  with three 
main parameters: adequate fluid intake, a high fiber diet  and regular physical act ivity.  
Fiber absorbs water, increases stool bulk, and in doing so stimulates the bowel to decrease stool transit time and ease evacuation.  Medicinal and dietary fiber supplements , 
such as psyllium, can be added to the high fiber diet or used as primary therapy. 
If lifestyle modification does not produce satisfactory results, subjects have access to a 
number of FDA-approved products (Food and Drug Administration), available both over the counter (OTC) and by [CONTACT_50246]. Stool softeners (docusate sodium, docusate calcium) act by [CONTACT_207503], making the stool softer, which makes it easier and less painful to pass. However, there is currently limited data on the efficacy of stool softeners in subject s wit h constipation
1.  
Osmotic laxatives are also available, including polyethylene glycol (PEG), lactulose, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium citrate, magnesium sulfate, and sodium phosphate. PEG and lactulose have been shown to improve stool frequency and stool consistency
1,6,7.   
Osmotic laxatives contain poorly absorbed ions or molecules that retain water in the intestinal lumen. Although effective, they can cause bloating and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  In addition, due to their mechanism of action , they should be used with caution in older adults and in 
subject s with renal impairment because of the risk of dehydration and electrolyte 
disturbances. 
Stimulant laxatives include senna, bisacodyl or sodium pi[INVESTIGATOR_207489]. They induce fluid 
and electrolyte secretion by [CONTACT_207504], thereby [CONTACT_133239] a bowel movement.  
Recent advances in research have resulted in new classes of medication for the treatment 
of constipation, available on prescription. For example, linaclotide is an agonist of guanylate cyclase-C receptors, and increases chloride, bicarbonate and fluid secretion into the intestinal lumen, lubricating the stool and accelerating gastrointestinal transit. 
Linaclotide was FDA -approved in 2012 for CIC and IBS-C. Adverse events include 
diarrhea, which leads to discontinuation of the medication in approximately 5% of subject s
8.  In total, 8% of subject s in linaclotide clinical trials discontinued due to adverse 
events, and 27% had their dose reduced or suspended secondary to adverse reactions, the majority of which  were diarrhea or other gastrointestinal  adverse reactions.   See 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/ 2014/202811s004lbl.pdf
 
 Lubiprostone is approved for use in women with IBS-C and in men and women with CIC, as well as opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-induced constipation in subject s with non- cancer pain. It is a 
selective chloride channel activator, increasing ion and fluid secretion. The main adverse event s associated with lubiprostone are mild to moderate nausea and diarrhea

Approximately 29% of subject s who received lubiprostone 24 mcg twice daily in clinical 
trials experienced nausea; 4% of subjects had severe nausea while 9% of subject s 
discontinued treatment due to nausea. Approximately 12% of subjects who received 
lubiprostone 24 mcg twice daily experienced diarrhea; 2% had severe diarrhea while 2% discontinued treatment due to diarrhea.  In addition, it has been reported to cause dyspnea, which was reported in 2.5% of the treated chronic idiopathic constipation population and 0.4% in the treated IBS-C population. Although not classified as serious adverse events, some subjects discontinued treatment because of this event. These events have usually been described as a sensation of chest tightness and difficulty taking in a breath, and generally have an acute onset within 30-[ADDRESS_247855] dose. They generally resolve within a few hours after taking the dose, but recurrence has been frequently reported with subsequent doses.  See http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/ 2008/021908s005lbl.pdf
.   
In subjects with severe chronic constipation, surgery may be considered; however, it is generally limited to use in the most severe cases after medical management has failed to provide adequate relief.  In subject s with severe incapacitating slow transit constipation, 
colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis can improve constipation and related symptoms
10,11. 
In summary, while there are a variety of treatments available for constipation, there is currently no satisfactory treatment for many constipated subject s:  a US study show ed 
that 47% of constipated subject s are not completely satisfied with their current 
constipation treatment
3, while a European study show ed that only 27% of European 
subjects are satisfied with current treatment options5. Furthermore, many subjects become 
refractory to one or more OTC laxatives with chronic use, which may cause frustration for both the clinician and the subject , and ultimately leads many subject s to abandon 
therapy and remain dissatisfied with their condition
2. Nearly 90% of subject s express 
interest in new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]12.

7.2 Intended Use   
 
The Vibrant Capsule is an orally administrated  capsule intended for the treatment of 
Functional Constipation (FC) in subjects aged 22 years or older. 
 
 VIBRATING CAPSULE  
PROTOCOL FOR STUDY V -240 Doc No: 240CLD  
Rev:  03 Date:  December 6th, [ADDRESS_247856] s. Constipation relief is achieved by 
[CONTACT_182597]’s vibrations impi[INVESTIGATOR_207490], consequently inducing peristaltic activity which promotes transit and facilitates defecation . 
 The Vibrant Capsule has several important features:  
• Small Dimensions.  
• Easy to swallow (smooth shell). 
• Delay Mechanism  - A delay mechanism was incorporated in this device to allow 
sufficient time for the capsule to  arrive at the large intestine before it starts 
vibrating. The delay mechanism is the time between swallowing the capsule and 
activation and inducing vibrations within the large intestine. This is obtained by a 
simple software programing mechanism. 
• Sequence Mechanism – sequence of vibration, specifically adapted for subject s 
with constipation. 
The capsule is activated by [CONTACT_207505].  
 
8.[ADDRESS_247857] and batteries, all 
encapsulated in a 2 -pi[INVESTIGATOR_207491] (please refer to Figure 1  below). The capsule is activated 
by [CONTACT_207506], prior to swallowing the capsule.    
       
The capsule dimensions are:  
 Length : 24.2 ± 0.1 mm 
 Diameter: 11.3± 0.1 mm 
 
The capsule shell is made of a well -known biocompatible material: PC MAKROLON 
2458. 
Before starting the vibrating action and to ensure the capsule has arrived at the large 
intestine, the company has integrated a tightly controlled vibrating algorithm that will 
define number of hours from the activation to the vibrating phase.

Following ingestion of the capsule, the vibrating sequence begins after a predetermined 
amount of time (delay). This delay will allow the capsule to reach the large intestine 
before starting the vibrations.  
 
The vibration rate is the following: 
Activation Delay is set to 8 ± 1 hours while sequence of vibration (vibration rate) is 190 
vibration cycles in an hour; each cycle consists of 3 seconds of vibration and 16 seconds 
of repose (rest). Total vibrating time per 1 hour work is 9.5 min. 
 
The capsules are packaged in a blister of 10 units (cf. Fig. 2 below).

Rev:  03 Date:  December 6th, [ADDRESS_247861] , there will be no unwanted outputs of energy or substance. This has 
been evaluated and confirmed in preclinical testing (please refer to the study 
investigational brochure). 
 
The capsule coating (a biocompatible and widely used shell) protects the subject  from 
any potential hazards that might be associated with its contents. The energy of the 
batteries is harmless and cannot leak while the capsule remains intact (break force was 
tested up to 60 Kgf/cm²). The capsule was tested for Safety and EMC [ZIP_CODE] tr ials. No 
ionizing radiation is emitted and no thermal energy  generated . 
 
Device manufacturing and assembly is done in  an ISO [ZIP_CODE]:[ADDRESS_247862] s who completed the study, 12 reported 
Adverse Events (AEs). In all, [ADDRESS_247863] been related to the study. They were: 
- Abdominal pain: [ADDRESS_247864] s (11.1%), 5 events 
- Diarrhea: [ADDRESS_247865] s (7.7%), 2 events 
- Flatulence: [ADDRESS_247866] s (7.7%), 2 events. 
 
All adverse events were mild, and all resolved without any action taken. F latulence lasted 
for 7 and 15 days.  One event of abdominal pain (stomach ache) lasted one day. All other 
events were resolved within one day. 
 
Vital Signs and ECG results did not demonstrate any safety concerns .  
 
During the double- blind, sham -controlled, phase [ADDRESS_247867] s the overall rates of adverse events was not statistically different between sham 
and active groups with the exception of a sensation of vibration (not resulting in  
discomfort or pain) which was more common in the active group. The rate of occurrence 
of bloating/flatulence was numerically but not statistically significantly higher in the 
sham group, and the rate of diarrhea was numerically but not statistically significantly 
higher in the active group.

9.2 Benefits  
 
 
Human Clinical Investigations  
 
Phase 1, 2a and 3 studies show ed clinical benefit s with the Vibrant Capsule: the capsule 
increased the number of weekly SBM among subject s with constipation and improved 
constipation symptoms, such as straining, bloating and stool consistency. 
 
During the phase 2a, single- arm, investigation, there was a significant increase in the 
mean number of SBMs/week for the entire study population. The increase in the mean 
number of SBMs/week for the entire study population was 1.60 ± 1.09; from 2.19 ±0.67 
to 3.79 ± 1.31 (p < 0.001). The mean number of weekly SBMs increased from baseline in 
[ADDRESS_247869] s (88.5%).   
In sub-group analyses by [CONTACT_207511], the mean increase in SBM was 1.46 ± 
1.08 (p = 0.001) for subjects having IBS-C and 1.75 ± 1.14 (p = 0.001) for subjects with 
functional constipation. For the entire study population and for the two sub- groups, each 
weekly mean SBM was higher than the mean at baseline.  
 
In the phase [ADDRESS_247870]  severity of constipation during the baseline period (average weekly number of 
SBM).    
Subject s with ≥1.1 and <2.5 SBMs at baseline were selected. They represented half of the 
population (N=77).  This subgroup demonstrated a 12% increase in the responder rate 
(increase of at least 1 SBM/week) for the Vibrant Capsule (59.5%) compared to the 
control (47.5%).   
In addition, clinical benefit was observed in the Bristol Stool Score, straining and 
bloating: they were significantly improved in the Vibrant arm, compared to sham 
(respectively p=0.0237, p=0.0072 and p=0.0031).  
 
 
10. ANIMAL INVESTIGATIONS  
 
Two animal studies were conducted using the Vibrant Capsule: 
The initial study was approved by [CONTACT_207512] (approval no. 
IL-089-09-2008), and performed at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology. The 
study was overseen by [CONTACT_207513]. Study 
objectives were to evaluate the safety and physiological effect of the v ibrating capsule in 
 VIBRATING CAPSULE

3 dogs. On study initiation the dogs were given sham capsules to evaluate defecation 
time, clear passage of the capsule and safety. After approximately 1 week each animal 
swallowed a vibrating capsule in different intervals starting from 3 days to two week 
intervals during a 6-month period. 
 
Final analysis showed that the capsules were safe for use – they were not damaged even 
when bitten by [CONTACT_207514]. There was no evidence of any discomfort or adverse effects on 
the dog’s health. Evidence of effectiveness of the capsule was indicated by [CONTACT_207515], without creating 
artificial constipation conditions in the dog's gastrointestinal tract.   
 
The second study was conducted at the Rambam Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207492], Israel.  The study was 
approved by [CONTACT_207516] (approval no. IL-130-11-2009).  
Study objectives were to evaluate the safety and physiological effect of vibrating capsule 
in 2 dogs. On study initiation the dogs were given sham capsules to evaluate defection 
time, clear passage of the capsule and safety. After approximately 2 days each  animal 
ingested a vibrating capsule every second day for two weeks' time and was followed for 
an additional month. Capsule delay time was adjusted for the animal model (8 hours for a 
smaller dog and 16 hours for a bigger dog). Clinical observations were recorded by [CONTACT_207517], pain, vomiting or irregular behavior. In addition 
X-ray was used to verify capsule location and vibrating movement. The time of 
defecation and stool consistency were recorded. The capsules were retrieved from the 
dog stools. Capsule integrity was confirmed; capsules were whole with no defects in seal, 
no ruptures, no shell cracks or any other damage.   
 
In all the animals the capsule were passed by [CONTACT_207518]/or any damage to the capsules. There was no evidence that the capsule's colon 
transit or its vibration caused any adverse effect to the dog's physical health and behavior.  
Evidence of effectiveness of the capsule was indicated by [CONTACT_207519]. Moreover, one dog suffered from 
constipation for 4 days (not induced by [CONTACT_1758]), which was relieved by [CONTACT_207520].  
 
11. HUMAN CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS  
 
Vibrant Ltd. has completed three human clinical investigations. 
 
Total Exposure – Human Clinical Investigations 
The human clinical investigations performed by [CONTACT_207521] a total of [ADDRESS_247871] s who received 
the Vibrant Capsule were as follows:

Capsule.  
 
Phase 1 clinical investigation – healthy volunteers 
 
An initial clinical study was approved and initiated in 2 sites in Israel (Tel-Aviv Sourasky 
Medical Center and The Holy Family Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Nazareth), from March 8 to 24th, 2011. 
The study was initially approved for use in 6 healthy volunteers in order to evaluate the 
safety of the Vibrant Capsule in a prospective, open- label , single group study. 
Six consecutive healthy volunteers (3 men and 3 women) ages 21 to 41 years, all 
fulfilling the exclusion/exclusion criteria, were enrolled in the study. During the Baseline 
study visit, subjects were evaluated for eligibility and went through physical examination, 
vital sign measurements, ECG measurements and blood tests, which were all within the 
normal values. Eligible subjects were asked to take 1 vibrating capsule by [CONTACT_71510].  Subjects were followed for 7 days on their normal bowel movements and 
excretion of the capsule.  One week following the baseline visit, subjects returned for a 
visit and repeated the physical examination, vital sign measurements, ECG measurements 
and blood tests.  
All capsules were evacuated from the body, along with stool, safely with no adverse 
events. Average time for capsule excretion was 2.2 days ([ADDRESS_247874]). All clinical and laboratory results were within normal 
values.  Thus, this preliminary study demonstrated safety of the capsule to support 
subsequent studies in the target population. 
 
Phase 2a clinical investigation  
 
The Phase 2a clinical trial was conducted in the Departments of Gastroenterology and 
Hepatology at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and at The Nazareth Holy Family 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], beginning in July 2011. The study was an open- label , pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].  
The primary endpoint was safety, assessed descriptively by [CONTACT_207522] 
(AEs), clinical laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, and ECG measurements.  
The secondary endpoint was efficacy, determined as an increase of more than one 
spontaneous bowel movement (SBM)/week during the 7.5 weeks of treatment compared 
to the 2- week run -in period.  The number of spontaneous bowel movements was 
calculated as a weekly average.  
 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Inclusion criteria were:

laxatives. The capsule was activated and started vibrating [ADDRESS_247879] s were recruited into the study and 26 completed it (the two 
dropouts were not interested in participating in the study anymore. The reason for 
dropout was the difficulty in the study design. Subjects had to collect each capsule from 
their stool and bring it back to the study coordinator). Fourteen of those who completed 
the study had IBS-C and 12 had functional constipation. The mean age of the 26 subjects 
who completed the study was 47.0 ±12.6 years (range 19–65).  The majority of subj ects 
(25/26) were female, as expected in a constipation clinical trial.

Safety analysis  
A summary of all gastrointestinal adverse events observed in the study by [CONTACT_207523].  A table with all adverse events, including non-
gastrointestinal events, is provided in Appendix B.  As shown in the table below, there 
were no statistically significant differences in adverse event rates between the Vibrant 
Capsule and sham groups with the exception of the sensation of vibration in the abdomen 
which was statistically significantly higher in the Vibrant Capsule group compared to the 
sham group, as shown below.  The rate of occurrence of bloating/flatulence was 
numerically but not statistically significantly higher in the sham group, and the rate of 
diarrhea was numerically but not statistically significantly higher in the  Vibrant capsule 
group.  
In addition, no subject  experienced adverse events related to the Vibrant Capsule that 
required discontinuation.  There were also no adverse events related to the Vibrant 
Capsule that were considered serious.  The only serious adverse events in the study were 
not related to the Vibrant Capsule (fractured nose and injured knee).

number of SBM for both groups over the treatment period. The mean number of 
SBMs/week was increased from 2.0 during run-in to 3.5-4.3 SBMs/week throughout the 
8-week treatment period, and remained elevated during the washout period. Similar 
improvements were observed over time with respect to the median number of SBMs.

The secondary endpoints included the change from baseline in weekly SBMs, as reported 
above; the time from first Vibrant Capsule intake to first SBM; use of rescue 
medications; and PAC -QOL  change from baseline; the change from baseline in Bristol 
Stool Score. Additional endpoints included: functional symptoms of bloating, straining, 
abdominal gas, and abdominal pain. The results for the change from baseline in weekly 
SBMs is provided above.  Multiple secondary and additional endpoints with respect to 
the Br istol Stool Score and symptoms showed evidence of benefit, as discussed below.  
With respect to the time to first SBM, there was no significant difference between groups.  
There was also no significant difference between groups in the use of rescue medication 
or the change from baseline in the PAC -QOL  score.  
 
Number of accumulative days with rescue therapy  
 
Use of rescue medication was authorized after [ADDRESS_247897] s were allowed to take, by [CONTACT_75775]: a glycerin suppository, an enema, or 
a laxative/bisacodyl tablet. The number of subjects who took rescue medication during 
the study does not indicate how many days each subject  took rescue medication during 
the treatment. In order to reflect best the quantity of rescue taken, the number of days 
each subject took rescue medication was accumulated. For example, if [ADDRESS_247898] s took rescue medication only once, then the 
number of rescue days will be 3*5 + 2*1=17.  
The number of days with rescue medication, stratified by [CONTACT_207524], is 
detailed below ( Table 4). Table 5  details the statistical tests (one for the Vibrant arm, one 
for the Sham arm) assessing whether the rescue usage between the responders and non-
responders (within the Vibrant arm, and within the sham arm, separately) was significant 
or not. 
Subject s from the Vibrant (and Sham) groups who were responders used significantly 
less rescue medication than subject s who were not responders (p<0.0001 for Vibrant 
group, p=0.0002 for Sham): in the Vibrant group, responders took a total of [ADDRESS_247899]

Bristol Stool Scale  
 
 
The Bristol Stool Scale is a 7 -point, validated scale used to define stool consistency; it 
has been proven to be a useful indicator of transit time13-15. The scale ranges from 1 
(hard, dried, small lumpy stool) which a very constipated subject  is expected to have, to 7 
(liquid stool) which corresponds to diarrhea. The scale reflects the amount of time the 
stool spent in the large intestine. The scales [ADDRESS_247900] s in the Vibrant group had an improvement in the Bristol score of 0.9, vs. 0.5 
in the sham group. The difference in improvement between the two groups is 0.4 and is 
close to significance (p=0.0629), indicating that the Vibrant Capsule improved transit.

Efficacy analysis – post hoc subgroup 
 
 Primary endpoints  
 
Based on a preliminary post- hoc analysis of the data, it became clear that the study 
eligibility criteria based on SBMs allowed the enrollment of a wide range of subject s of 
varying severity. Based on a the observed placebo effect in the overall population, as 
discussed above, additional analysis was performed stratified by [CONTACT_207525], based 
on average SBMs/week at baseline.  The results of this analysis demonstrat e that the 
appropriate population most likely to benefit from use of the Vibrant Capsul e is those 
with moderate to severe constipation. This subgroup was defined according to severity 
at baseline calculated as the weekly average number of SBM. The subjects with ≥2.[ADDRESS_247902]  severity of constipation, the three subgroups encompassing the entire 
population study, were defined as follows:  
- Subject s with very severe constipation: average weekly SBM <1.[ADDRESS_247903] s with moderate to severe constipation: average weekly SBM ≥1.1 and 
<2.5,  (50% of the subject s) 
- Subject s with mild constipation: average weekly SBM ≥2.5. 
 
The responder rate stratified by [CONTACT_207526]/week, 
for the best [ADDRESS_247904] s with ≥1.1 and <2.5 SBMs at baseline represented half of the 
population (N=77).  This subgroup demonstrated a 12% increase in the responder rate 
(increase of at least 1 SBM/week) for the Vibrant Capsule (59.5%) compared to the 
control (47.5%).

average number of SBMs/week, several secondary and additional endpoints showed a 
statistically significant difference in favor of Vibrant for the same subgroup, as explained 
below, including the Bristol Stool Score, straining, bloating, and use of rescue 
medications.   
 
Bristol Stool Scale  
 
At the conclusion of the 8- week treatment, there was a significant difference of 0.[ADDRESS_247909] s (p= 0.0237).  While the other groups 
(<1.1 or ≥2.5 SBMs/week) also showed some numerical advantage for the Vibrant 
Capsule (0.3 and 0.1 SBM/week increase), the effect was smaller . Subjects in the Vibrant 
Capsule group generally moved from stools characterized as very hard to pass to stools 
that were easier to pass according to the scale.   
For moderate to severe subject s, although both Vibrant and Sham arms showed 
improvement, the Vibrant group improved, on average, twice as much as the sham group, 
corresponding to 1.[ADDRESS_247910] colonic contractility.

In addition to the Capsule’s highly favorable safety profile, the majority of subject s in the 
overall population, approximately 60%, showed improvement in symptoms that was 
corroborated with the improvement of the SBM, providing clinically meaningful benefit 
for the subject s, with respect to the number of SBMs/week.  S everal of the secondary 
endpoints reached significance or trended toward significance, including bloating 
(p=0.0345), the Bristol Stool Score (p=0.0629), straining (p=0.0824), and abdominal ga s 
(p=0.1094).   
 
The subgroup that was identified as most likely to benefit from the Vibrant Capsule is 
those with moderate to severe constipation, defined as ≥1.1 and <2.5 SBMs/week.  The 
group with less than 1 SBM/week may have pathology too severe for the Vibrant Capsul e 
to overcome with only 2 capsules/week, while the group with ≥2.5 SBMs/week may have 
a condition too mild to allow sufficient room for improvement according to the specified 
response criteria.  While none of the three subgroups were detrimentally affected  by [CONTACT_207528], the subgroup with moderate to severe CIC showed the greatest 
benefit, with a clinically meaningful difference of 12% between the two groups and 
additional evidence of improvement on several secondary endpoints, including the Bristol 
Stool Scale, as well as symptom scores for bloating and straining based on daily diaries.  
The safety profile in the moderate to severe CIC subgroup was also highly favorable, as 
in the overall population. 
Based on the positive signal, the Sponsor has decided to increase the frequency of 
administration of the Vibrant Capsule and to confirm the positive results reported in the 
sub-cohort population.

constipation and medication use (including prescription medication) will be throroughly 
assessed. Subject  demographic and medical information acquired from the subject  or the 
subject 's medical chart, including age, gender, previous medical history, risk factors etc. 
will be also recorded on the eCRF.   
In addition, subject s will undergo a physical examination including digital rectal 
examination, vital sign measurements  and blood tests.  
 Subject s will then  fill in the the  Rome III  questionnaire to confirm the diagnosis of 
Chronic Idiopathic Constipation and fill out the Bristol Stool S cale and PAC -QOL 
questionnaire .  Findings will be recorded on the e CRF.  
 Eligible subject s will then be asked to refrain from taking any medication or supplement 
they are using to relieve their constipation , and will  perform a daily self -assessment  of 
their normal  spontaneous  bowel movement s for 14 consecutive days  (run-in period), 
utilizing  the eDiary . Subject s will also be asked to record clinical symptoms and usage of 
any m edication or supplement  on the eDiary during the run- in period.  
 After the run -in period the subject s will visit the medical center  for the baseline visit. 
Eligibility will be re -assessed and confirmed ba sed on the subject 's completed eD iary and

deviations in the EDC.  
15.17  Investigative Center Selection Criteria  
 
The investigative site will meet the following selection criteria prior to inclusion in this 
study:  
• Clinical research study experience and resources that demonstrate good 
compliance with study requirements and timely, complete documentation of subject follow -up.   
• Sufficient subject volume to meet enrollment timeframe.  
16. ADVERSE EVENTS RECORDING  
 
At each evaluation, the investigator will determine whether any adverse events (AE’s) 
have occurred. All adverse events occurring during the study will be recorded on the appropriate case report form page by [CONTACT_093].  The nature, severity and rela tion of 
the adverse event to the study device will be documented. 
16.1 Reporting Requirements  
Timely and complete reporting of Adverse Events (AE) and safety assessment allows:  
• Protection of safety and study subjects. 
• Greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the study treatment.  
• Appropriate modification of study protocols and improvement in study design and procedures.  
• Adherence to regulatory requirements.  
The definitions and reporting requirements adopted in this study are derived from the current International standard on clinical investigations: Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), part 312 (Investigational New Drug Application), Section 32 (IND Safety Reporting) and part 812 (Investigational Device Exemptions), Section 150 (Reports).  
16.2 Definitions  
Adverse Events (AE)  
AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject. This definition does not imply that there is a relationship between the adverse event and the device under investigation.  An AE can therefore be any unintended sign, symptom, disease or injury or any unt oward clinical signs (including an abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, 
 VIBRATING CAPSULE  
PROTOCOL FOR STUDY V -240 Doc No: 240CLD

users  or other persons whether or not related to the investigational medical device. The 
following should be reported as AE:  
• Untoward medical conditions or signs or symptoms that were absent before 
starting study treatment.  
• Untoward medical conditions or signs or symptoms present before starting study 
treatment and worsen (increase severity or frequency) after starting study 
treatment.  
• Abnormal laboratory findings. 
• Clinical signs or symptoms that require therapy.  
 Device Deficiency  
Device Deficiency is defined as Inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance, such as malfunction, misuse or use error and inadequate labeling.  Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
ADE is adverse event, related to the use of an investigational medical device. This includes any adverse event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use or the deployment of the device, the operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device, device failure or misuse, and any event that is a result of a user error.  
 Device failures, Malfunctions and Misuse  
Investigators are instructed to report all possible device failures  or misuse observed  
during the course of  the trial. These incidents will be documented in the case report form 
provided as follows:  
 
• Device Failure - A device failure has occurred when the device is used in 
compliance with the Instructions for Use, but does not perform as described in the Instructions for Use. A device failure occurs when  
o A capsule fails to activate.   
o The transmission about the first capsule activation cannot be performed (during the baseline visit)  by [CONTACT_207537]. This event must lead to the 
replacement of the base unit .  
o The base unit loses its ability to transmit information permanently. This 
event must lead to the replacement of the base unit.  
Device Misuse -  Any use of the investigational device by [CONTACT_207538].   
 
 Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
A SAE is an adverse event that:  
1.     Led to a death,  
2.     Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
 VIBRATING CAPSULE  
PROTOCOL FOR STUDY V -240 Doc No: 240CLD  
Rev:  03 Date:  December 6th, [ADDRESS_247945] led to a SAE if a suitable action had not been taken 
or intervention had not been made or if circumstances had been less opportune are also handled under the SAE reporting system.  However, planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing condition and/or procedure required by 
[CONTACT_73326], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered to be a SAE.  
 Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
A Serious Adverse Device Effect is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
 Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
[LOCATION_003]DE is defined as serious adverse device effect which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report or other study related documents.  
 
16.3 Anticipated Adverse Events  
The Vibrant Capsule  targets pathophysiological parameters of chronic constipation by 
[CONTACT_207539]. 
Anticipated Adverse Events include those that are reasonably expected to occur in association with a clinical investigation assessing a treatment for functional constipation. Events can occur as a result of the disease or as a result of the treatment (including usage of the home base unit). They may include but are not limited to the following (in alphabetical order):  
• Abdominal pain/discomfort /crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
• Blood in the stool may develop or increase  
• Bloating/Flatulence  
• Diarrhea   
• Nausea may develop or increase  
• Rectal pain may develop or increase  
• Sensation of vibration in the abdomen  
• Uncontrolled leakage of stool may occur  
• Vomiting may develop 
 All events listed above, and additional events that the investigator will evaluate will fit the definition of ‘anticipated event’, will be categorized as such in the study.

recorded by [CONTACT_207540] e CRF, within a reasonable 
time (up to 5 calendar days from investigator's awareness of the event). All AEs will be characterized by [CONTACT_4868]:  
• Intensity or Severity  
• Relatedness  
• Outcome  
• Treatment or Action Taken . 
 
16.4.1  Intensity or Severity  
The following categories of the intensity of an adverse event are to be used:  Mild  – Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject ’s usual 
activity or is transient, resolved without treatment and with no sequelae.  
Moderate – Interferes with the subject ’s usual activity and/or requires symptomatic 
treatment.  
Severe – Symptom(s) causing severe discomfort and significant impact of the subject ’s 
usual activity and requires treatment.  
16.4.2  Relatedness  
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the investigational medical device:  
Not related  - The cause of the AE is known and the event is not related to the 
investigational medical device.  
Possibly related  - There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_207541].  
The AE has a timely relationship to the study procedure(s); however, follows no known pattern of response, and an alternative cause seems more likely or there is significant uncertainty about the cause of the event.  Probably related  - It is likely that the event was caused by [CONTACT_207542].  
The AE has a timely relationship to the study procedure(s) and follows a known pattern of response; a potential alternative cause, however, may explain the event. Related  - A related event has a strong temporal relationship and an alternative cause is 
unlikely. 
 
16.4.3  Outcome  
The clinical outcome of the AE or SAE will be characterized as follows:  
Death  - The SAE CRF must be completed for this outcome  (see 16.5 Expedited 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events).  
Recovered without sequelae -  The subject  returned to baseline status  
 VIBRATING CAPSULE

Rev:  03 Date:  December 6th, [ADDRESS_247947]  outcome is unknown 
 
16.4.4  Treatment or Action taken  
The treatment or action taken after the occurrence of an AE or SAE will be reported as:  
Interventional Treatment  - Surgical, percutaneous or other procedure  
Medical Treatment  - Medication frequency of administration reduction/interruption or 
discontinuation, or medication initiated for event  
None  - No action is taken 
 
16.5 Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Any Serious Adverse Event, and device deficiencies  should be reported to Vibrant Ltd. 
within 24 hours of investigators' knowledge of the event. Investigator should report these events on the appropriate SAE form / Device Deficiencies Form in the eCRF and send the form by [CONTACT_3719] e-mail, to the following safety contact [CONTACT_9702]:

17.4.1  Procedure  
After all the relevant data will be entered into the database, and the database cleaned, a 
soft lock to the database will be performed. An independent un- blinded statistician (not 
the study statistician) will perform the assessments described below. A designated Data Monitoring Committee will recommend whether to stop the study once the interim results are available.  
At the interim ana lysis, the data of the evaluable subjects will be analyzed  . 
17.4.2  Blinding  
ONLY the un -blinded statistician and members of the interim decision committee will be 
exposed to the interim report. The members of the DSMB ( Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee ) may also have access to the unmasked information of the interim analysis. 
Investigators and company directors will only be informed of a decision to continue or to discontinue the trial, or to implement modifications in trial procedure. The un- blinded

17.8 Data Analysis Sets  
17.8.1  Intent to Treat (ITT)  
The ITT analysis set will consist of all subjects randomized. In accordance with the ITT principle, all subjects randomized will be kept in their originally assigned treatment group.
  
17.8.2  Modified Intent to Treat ( mITT) 
The mITT analysis set will consist of all randomized  subjects who met the inclusion 
criteria of the protocol and successfully completed Visit 1. In accordance with the ITT principle, all subjects randomized will be kept in their originally assigned treatment group. Subjects  with no valid post baseline assessment will not be part of the relevant 
analysis.  
17.8.3  Per-Protocol (PP)  
The per -protocol analysis set will consist of all subjects from the mITT analysis set  
without major protocol violations  and successfully completed the study. 
Major protocol deviations include:  
o Subject who received, by [CONTACT_86966], both treatments (sham capsule and Vibrant 
capsule).  
o More than 25% of the capsules missed or swallowed without activation 
during the treatment period (calculated according to device accountability CRFs). o Subjects with less than 2 weeks (with at least 5 days each week) of valid 
diary data.  
o Use of at least one prohibited drug like opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], Ca+ channel blockers, etc.

17.8.4  Statistical Analysis of Analysis Sets  
The ITT analysis set will serve as the main set for safety  and efficacy  assessments . 
The primary  and secondary efficacy assessment will also be performed on the PP  and 
mITT  analysis set s. 
17.9 Statistical Analysis  
17.9.1  General Considerations  
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® v9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary 
NC, [LOCATION_003]) . 
Baseline demographic and other baseline characteristics, together with safety analyses will be performed on all enrolled subjects. Baseline values are defined as the last valid value prior to treatment .
 
All statistical tests will be two -sided.  If statistical tests are performed nominal p -values 
will be presented. Where confidence limits are appropriate, a two -sided 95% confidence 
interval will be constructed . 
For comparison of means (continuous variables), the two- sample t -test or the Wilcoxon 
rank sum test will be used as appropriate.  For comparison of proportions (categorical variables), the Chi -squared test or Fisher’s exact test will be used as appropriate .
 
17.9.2  Significance levels and handling of type I 
error  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Type I Error  
The overall significance level for this study is 5% using two- tailed tests . According to [ 1-
2-3], planning an interim analysis that permits an increase in the sample size as described 
in section 17.4 does not inflate the type I error. The treatment by [CONTACT_207544] a significance level of 15%.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Endpoints  
The Benjamini and Hochberg technique for controlling the false discovery rate will be implanted for the two primary endpoints  for adjusting the level of significance as well as 
the confidence intervals .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hierarchy Approach for Secondary 
Endpoints Analysis  
The hierarchy approach will be adopted for the primary and secondary endpoints to 
control type I error due to multiple endpoint s testing. Thus , the primary endpoint s will 
first be analyzed and only if one of them will be found statistically significant (see the method described in section [IP_ADDRESS] above) , will the secondary endpoints be analyze d.  
 The first secondary endpoint will be tested, first, for statistical significance and only if found significant (versus an alpha level of 5%), the next in line will be tested. Only if the

The adjusted success rate per study arm, and their difference between the groups will be presented along with their respective 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).  
 The CSBM2 success rate will be analyzed in the same manner.  
 The SBM success rate will be analyzed in the same manner.  
  The change from baseline in number of weekly CSBM will be modeled with an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model, with baseline weekly number of CSBM and site as covariates. The adjusted means of the change from baseline per study arm, and their difference between the grou ps will be presented along with their respective 95% CI.  
 The change from baseline in count of weekly SBM, in symptoms, and in quality of life will be analyzed with similar ANCOVA models, with their respective baseline values as covariate.  
 Time to occurrence of SBM after intake of the first Vibrant capsule (either active or sham) will be assessed and presented by [CONTACT_5263]- Meier curves and will be compared 
between the study arms using the Log- Rank test  if relevant.

28. SUBJECT / STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
 
Subjects should be removed from the study whenever considered necessary for their 
welfare or when the subject expresses a desire to withdraw from the study. Non-compliance with the protocol, the occurrence of a Serious Adverse Event or any medical 
condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], warrants discontinuation from the study 
for the safety of the subject, may necessitate discontinuing a subject. If a subject is discontinued, the reason must be entered on the case report form and signed by [CONTACT_093]. In case of any questionable situation, the study monitor or Vibrant  Ltd. 
personnel should be consulted. When a subject is removed from the study as a result of Serious Adverse Event, a final physical examination must be performed. Subjects removed from the study because of an adverse event will be followed- up until the adverse 
event has been resolved.  
 In the case that the occurrence of adverse events is greater than anticipated, the clinical investigation will be suspended; in such a case, a safety committee will be arranged to decide if the study could be continued. The Ethics Committee will be notifie d and the 
results of the safety committee discussions will be brought for the EC review and decision.  Early termination could be a result of:  
1. Withdrawal of informed consent by [CONTACT_423].  
2. Subject s who after inclusion develop medical diseases which may affect the 
function and interpretation of study results. 
3. Serious protocol deviation. 
4. Non-compliance with medical device administration or study procedures as 
determined by [CONTACT_456]. 
5. Change in subject's condition. 
6. Subject  is Lost to follow -up. 
7. Confirmed pregnancy.  
8. Regulatory authorities stop the trial.  
 During the study, subject s exiting the trial will be replaced with new subject s, in order to 
have approximately 238 subje cts at the end of the trial.

APPENDIX A  – Bristol Stool Scale  
 
 
The Bristol Stool Scale:   How to analyze stools: 
 
Type 1:  Stools appear in separate, hard lumps, similar to nuts. Type 
[ADDRESS_247969] amount of time; a sure 
sign you’re constipated; most common stools.  
 Type 2:  Stools are sausage -like in appearance but lumpy. Indicate 
toxic constipation and need for intestinal cleansing  
 Type 3 (Normal):  Stools come out similar to a sausage but with 
cracks in the surface.  
 Type 4 (Normal):  Stools are smooth and soft in the form of a 
sausage or snake.  
 Type 5:  Stools form soft blobs with clear -cut edges, and easily pass 
through the digestive system. Soft diarrhea, it may indicate a 
possible risk for bowel disease; also indicate you are toxic and need 
regular intestinal cleansing.  
 Type 6:  Stools have fluffy pi[INVESTIGATOR_6927]. Considered 
mushy stools, they indicate diarrhea; and that you are toxic and 
need regular intestinal cleansing.  
 Type 7:  Stool is mostly liquid with no solid pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928]. Passed quickly 
through the colon; is indicative of severe diarrhea possibly as a 
result of a viral or bacterial infection. See a doctor as soon as 
possible.

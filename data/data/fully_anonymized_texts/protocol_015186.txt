patients.  
7) Comparison of recurrence -free survival in patients treated with e ither MEDI -[ADDRESS_845339]-surgical patients.  
 
Study Design:  
Subject s with MPM will undergo surgical mediastinal lymph node biopsy (cervical mediastinoscopy) 
and simultaneous surgical biopsy of the pleural tumor by [CONTACT_633187], at which time tumor tissue (at 
least 2 g) and peripheral blood will be collected for the  study. These procedures are performed as our 
standard of care in the treatment of these subject s. The subject  will be randomized. Three days to three  
weeks after the biopsy,  [ADDRESS_845340] s (if tissue obtained)  will be randomly treated with either 
MEDI -4736  alone  (15 mg/kg once intravenously)  (n=8)  or MEDI -4736 ( 1500 mg  once intravenously) 
plus treme limumab ( 75 mg  once intravenously)  (n=8) , or a control group (n=4)  in a randomized 
controlled  study design . There will be two treatment arms (MEDI4736 only and combination 
MEDI4736+tremelimumab) and one untreated arm (control). Randomization, stratified by [CONTACT_633188], will be performed and will help to minimize patient selection biases 
between three ar ms. Subjects under  [ADDRESS_845341] s will undergo 
resectional surgery , including extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) or pleurectomy/decortication  (P/D),  
at which time  the tumor will be removed (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 200-1000 g ) and obtained for study. Four patients 
that do not undergo tr eatment with MEDI -4736 or tremelimumab will be included as controls. Blood 
will be obtained after  the induction of general anesthesia for both the thoracos copy procedure and the 
EPP or P/D resectional procedure , as is routinely done in these procedures . The sixth rib will be obtained 
at the time of the resection. After the removal of the tumor, our standard protocol includes intraoperative 
heated chemotherapy using a lavage of intracavitary cisplatin in the pres ence of conserved renal function  
(Sugarbaker et al., 2013, 2014; Richards et al., 2006) .

Tumor tissues obtained either by [CONTACT_633189]-of-flight mass spectrometry (CyTOF) to determine intratumor al CD8/Treg ratios and percentage of 
ICOS positive CD4 T cells, and by [CONTACT_9064] (Ventana assay) to determine the tissue 
expression of PD -L1. These variables will be compared before and after treatment (changes within the 
same patient tumor), or  between treatment groups (MEDI -4736 alone, MEDI -4736+tremelimumab, 
untreated) following treatment. Additional hypothesis -generating analyses will include  a comprehensive 
systems based evaluation of the intratumoral immune cell population composition and p henotype 
phenotype [e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), neutrophils, 
T-cell subsets, natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells], and  immune -related gene expression using the 
nanostring system within the tumors, blood,  and bone marrow of patients in all treatment groups.

 Statistical Methods and Data Analysis:  
 
There will be two treatment arms (MEDI4736 only and combination MEDI4736+tremelimumab) and 
one untreated arm (control). Randomization, stratified by [CONTACT_633192], will 
help to minimize patient selection biases between three arms. Preliminary tests will be performed to 
assess whether our data is normally or non -normally distributed. Patient characteristics will be 
summarized descriptively. Baseli ne characteristics will be compared by [CONTACT_15500]. For our 
primary objective that compares outcome variable in tissues before and after treatment with combination 
MEDI4736 and tremelimumab, we will use a paired t -test in log -transformed ratio of intratumoral 
cytotoxic T cells to regulatory T cells (CD8/Treg) before and after the treatment.  In our secondary 
objective numerous variable comparisons are made between tumor tissues from untreated patients with 
from patients undergoing treatment with eit her MEDI4736 or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab, and between 
tumor tissues from patients undergoing treatment with MEDI4736 and tumor tissues from patients 
undergoing treatment with MEDI4736+tremelimumab. In these comparisons, a paired t -test or Student 
t-tests wi ll be performed.  Because approximately [ADDRESS_845349] -surgical patients. SAS software will be used for all other statistical analyses.

 Sample Size Determination:  
 
The primary objective is comparison of the ratio of CD8/Treg before and after treatment with 
combination MEDI4736+Tremelimumab. A total of 20 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in this study 
for 24 months and 8 subjects will be assigned to combination MED I4736+Tremelimumab (8 subjects 
to MEDI4736 only and 4 subjects to control). The outcome of interest in this study is a change in ratio 
of CD8/Treg before and after treatment with combination MEDI4736+Tremelimumab within subjects. 
Our sample size was theref ore calculated based upon the change in CD8/Treg ratio in tumor tissues 
before and after treatment with combination MEDI4736+Tremelimumab therapy. This sample size 
calculation is also applicable to our secondary objectives including the change in CD8/Treg ratio in 
tumor tissues before and after treatment with MEDI4736 monotherapy . 
 
Because there are no data available to estimate a change of ratio of CD8/Treg before and after the 
treatment  in MPM, we utilized data from preclinical reports, and clinical data in melanoma patients. 
The ratio of CD8 T cells to regulatory T cells (CD8/Treg) is increased by [CONTACT_633193] -4 and 
PD-1 within B16 mouse melanoma tumors (CD8/Treg ratio 2 in untreated, 11 in CTLA -4 treated, and 
8 in PD-1 treated)  (Curran et al.,  2010), and this ratio is predictive of therapeutic efficacy in this 
model ( Quezada et al., 2006 ). In a recent report of melanoma patients undergoing PD -[ADDRESS_845350] an increase in the numb er of 
intratumoral CD8 T cells following drug delivery (15.1 ± 6.6 to 36.0 ± 8.4 CD8 T cells/mm2) (Tumeh 
et al., 2014).  Further, our our pi[INVESTIGATOR_26923] 6 subjects with MPM the log transformed ratio of 
CD8/Treg was approximately normally distributed with a mean of 1.94(6.96 in raw scale) and standard 
deviation of 0.808(2.24 in raw scale). Assuming that repeat values are moderately correlated(r=0.5), 
then the difference between before and after the combination treatment will also have a standard 
deviation of 0.808(2.24 in raw scale). We estimate that we will have 80% power (alpha=5%, a paired t -
test) to detect an increased log ratio CD8/Treg of 2.87(17.71 in raw scale) after the combination 
treatment with 8 subjects.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive malignancy of the pleura that is 
associated with prior exposure to asbestos and is fatal in most cases. The tumor most commonly 
arises within the parietal pleura and spreads locally to the ipsilateral visceral pleura, lung, chest 
wall, diaphragm, pericardium, and mediastinum. Treatment  with standard cytotoxic 
chemotherapy regimens, including cisplatin and pemetrexed, results in an extension of the 
median survival time to 12 months, compared with cisplatin alone (Vogelzan g et al, 2003 ). For 
patients with disease confined to the ipsilater al hemithorax, surgical resection combined with 
systemic or intracavitary chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or other local modalities, has 
been offered with reports of more optimistic outcomes. The operative procedures most 
commonly used in these multim odal approaches include the following: extrapleural 
pneumonectomy (EPP), which involves en bloc resection of the lung, pericardium, diaphragm, 
visceral, and parietal pleura; and pleurectomy/decortication (P/D), which involves resection of 
the visceral and parietal pleura with or without resection of the pericardium and/or diaphragm . 
Nonetheless, the majority of these patients will suffer from recurrence and ulti mately succumb 
to the disease (Rusch et al., 2012; Sugarbaker et al., 2014) . There is a clear need for better 
systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_633152].  
1.[ADDRESS_845367] tumors are one of the body’s natural defenses against the 
growth and proliferation of cancer cells. However, over time and under pressure fro m immune 
attack, cancers develop strategies to evade immune -mediated killing , which  allows them to 
develop unchecked. One such mechanism involves the upregulation of surface proteins that 
deliver inhibitory signals to cytotoxic T cells. Programmed cell dea th ligand 1  (PD-L1) is one 
such protein, and is upregulated in a broad range of cancers with a high frequency, with up to 
88% expression in some tumor types . In a number of these cancers, including lung (Mu et al ., 
2011), renal (Thompson et al ., 2005; Thom pson et al ., 2006; Krambeck et al ., 2007), 
pancreatic (Nomi et al ., 2007; Loos et al ., 2008; Wang et al ., 2010), ovarian cancer 
(Hamanishi et al ., 2007),  and hematologic malignancies ( Andorsky et al ., 2011; Brusa et al ., 
2013) , tumor cell expression of PD -L1 is associated with reduced survival and an unfavorable 
prognosis.  
The blockade of negative regulatory signals to T -cells, such as PD -L1 and cytotoxic T -
lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA -4), has shown promising clinical activity. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a 
monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA -4 and prevents the interaction of CTLA -4 with cluster 
of differentiation (CD) [ADDRESS_845368] ivation and 
proliferation (Lipson et al., 2011) . Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_633153]: MEDI4736, tremelimumab

 advanced melanoma ( Hodi et al., 2010 ), and was granted [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approval in 2011 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.  
PD-L1 (B7 homolog 1 [B7 H1], CD274) is part of a complex system of recepto rs and ligands 
that are involved in controlling T -cell activation. In normal tissue, PD -L1 is expressed on T 
cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, mesenchymal stem cells, bone marrow -
derived mast cells, and in various non -hematopoietic cells ( Keir et al., 2008 ). The normal 
function of PD -L1 is to  regulate the balance between T -cell activation and tolerance through the 
interaction with two receptors, programmed death 1 (PD -1, CD279) and CD80 (B7 -1). In the 
tumor microenvironment, PD -L1 expressed  on tumor cells binds to PD -1 on activated T cells , 
which  delivers an inhibitory signal to those T cells, preventing them from killing target tumor 
cells and thus protecting the tumor from immune elimination ( Zou et al., 2008 ). In the clinic, 
antibody -medi ated blockade of PD -L1 induced durable tumor regression (objective response 
rate of 6 to 17%) and prolonged stabilization of the disease (rates of 12 to 41% at 24 weeks) in 
patients with advanced cancers, including non -small -cell lung cancer, melanoma, and  renal -cell 
cancer ( Brahmer et al., 2012 ). Similarly, treatment with anti -PD-1 antibodies produced 
objective responses in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non -small -cell lung 
cancer, melanoma, or renal -cell cancer ( Topalian et al., 20 12). 
Pre-clinical data and clinical research suggests that the concurrent targeting of immunologic 
checkpoints may generate superior anti -tumor activity when compared with a single -agent 
checkpoint blockade, which  may translate into higher and more durable  rates of response. 
Mouse data indicate that the mechanisms of activation of sites known to be involved in the  
activity of CTLA -[ADDRESS_845369] additive or synergistic activity ( Pardoll, 2012 ). For example, in mouse tumor models , the 
combination of PD -[ADDRESS_845370] alone ( Curran et al., 2010;  Duraiswamy et al., 2013 ). Notably, 
in models of murine melanoma, ant i-PD-1 blockade increased the expression of CTLA -4 on 
intratumoral T cells, and reciprocally, CTLA -4 blockade increased PD -1 expression on 
intratumoral T cells, suggesting one potential mechanism for the increased efficacy of dual 
checkpoint therapy ( Curra n et al., 2010 ). The concurrent administration of monoclonal 
antibodies to CTLA -4 (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) and PD -1 (nivolumab) was recently evaluated in a Phase I 
trial that showed impressive preliminary evidence of improved benefit in advanced melanoma 
patients. The  overall response rate was 53% at the maximum tolerated dose. Three patients 
presented with a complete response (CR), and all responding patients experienced a ≥80% 
decline in tumor burden at 12 weeks ( Wolchok et al., 2013 ). 
MPM has recently been recognize d as an immunogenic tumor, and durable clinical responses 
to immunotherapy have been obtained  in the laboratory setting ( Tan et al., 2014; Adusumilli

 2014; Adusumilli et al., 2014; Fridlender et al., 2009; Anraku et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2012 ). In 
murine models of MPM, for example, CTLA -4 blockade results in significant anti -tumor 
responses ( Wu et al., 2012 ). In the clinic, tremelimumab has shown encouraging clinical activity 
and an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in patients with advance d MPM who have been 
previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy ( Calabro et al., 2013 ). 
 
1.2 MEDI -4736 Background  
Investigators should be familiar with the current MEDI4736  Investigator Brochure (IB) . 
MEDI4736 is being developed as a potential anticancer therapy for patients with advanced 
solid tumors. MEDI4736 i s a human monoclonal antibody (M Ab) of the immunoglobulin G1 
kappa (IgG1κ) subclass that inhibits binding of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) (B7 
homolog 1 [B7 -H1], cluster of diff erentiation [CD]274) to programmed cell death 1 (PD -1; 
CD279) and CD80 (B7 -1). MEDI4736 is composed of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical 
light chains, with an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. MEDI4736 contains 
a triple mutation in the constant domain of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 heavy chain that 
reduces binding to complement protein C1q and the fragment crystallizable gamma (Fcγ) 
receptors involved in triggering effector function.  
1.2.1 Summary of non -clinical  experience  
The non -clinical experience is fully described in the current version of the MEDI4736  
Investigator’s Brochure  (IB).    
MEDI4736 binds with high affinity and specificity to human PD -L1 and blocks its interaction 
with PD -[ADDRESS_845371] of PD -L1 on primary human T cells, resulting in their restored proliferation and release 
of interferon gamma (IFN -γ). Additionally, MEDI4736 demonstrated a lack of antibody -
dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC) and complement -dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) 
in cell -based functional assays. In vivo studies show that MEDI4736 inhibits tumor growth in 
a xenograft model via a T lymphocyte (T -cell) dependent mechanism. Moreover, an anti -
mouse PD -L1 antibody demonst rated improved survival in a syngeneic tumor model when 
given as monotherapy and resulted in complete tumor regression in > 50% of treated mice 
when given in combination with chemotherapy. Combination therapy (dual targeting of PD -
L1 and cytotoxic T -lympho cyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA -4]) resulted in tumor regression 
in a mouse model of colorectal cancer.

 Cynomolgus monkeys were selected as the only relevant species for evaluation of the 
pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics and potential toxicity of ME DI4736. Following 
intravenous (IV) administration, the PK of MEDI4736 in cynomolgus monkeys was nonlinear. 
Systemic clearance (CL) decreased and concentration half -life (t1/2) increased with increasing 
doses, suggesting saturable target binding -mediated cl earance of MEDI4736. No apparent 
gender differences in PK profiles were observed for MEDI4736.  
In general, treatment of cynomolgus monkeys with MEDI4736 was not associated with any 
MEDI4736 -related adverse effects that were considered to be of relevance t o humans. 
Adverse findings in the non -Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) PK/pharmacodynamics and 
dose range -finding study, and a GLP 4 -week repeat -dose toxicity study were consistent with 
antidrug antibody (ADA) -associated morbidity and mortality in individual  animals. The death 
of a single animal in the non -GLP, PK/pharmacodynamics, and dose range -finding study was 
consistent with an ADA -associated acute anaphylactic reaction. The spectrum of findings, 
especially the clinical signs and microscopic pathology, i n a single animal in the GLP, 4 -
week, repeat -dose study was also consistent with ADA immune complex deposition, and 
ADA:MEDI4736 immune complexes were identified in a subsequent non -GLP, investigative 
immunohistochemistry study. Similar observations were r eported in cynomolgus monkeys 
administered human mAbs unrelated to MEDI4736. Given that immunogenicity of human 
mAbs in nonclinical species is generally not predictive of responses in humans, the ADA -
associated morbidity and mortality were not considered f or the determination of the no -
observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) of MEDI4736.  
Finally, data from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 3 -month GLP toxicity study with MEDI4736 in cynomolgus 
monkeys showed that subchronic dosing of MEDI4736 was not associated with any adverse 
effects. Therefore, the NOAEL of MEDI4736 in all the general toxicity studies was 
considered to be 100 mg/kg, the highest dose tested in these studies. In addition to the in vivo  
toxicology data, no unexpected membrane binding of MEDI4736 to human or cynomo lgus 
monkey tissues was observed in GLP tissue cross -reactivity studies using normal human and 
cynomolgus monkey tissues.  
1.2.2 Summary of clinical experience  
Clinical experience with MEDI4736  is fully described in the current version of the MEDI4736

 collaborative studies (Table 1.2 -1). Of the 1,883 subjects, 1,279 re ceived MEDI4736 
monotherapy, 440 received MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab or other anticancer 
agents, 14 received other agents (1 gefitinib, 13 MEDI6383), and [ADDRESS_845373] Metabolism  
The PK and immunogenicity profiles of MEDI4736 as monotherapy and combined with 
tremelimumab are described below based on data from key studies.  
 
Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Profile of MEDI4736 Monotherapy  
 
Study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1108: As of 09Feb2015, PK data were available for 378 subjects 
in the dose -escalation and dose -expansion phases of Study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1108 
following treatment with MEDI4736 0.1 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 15 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks (Q3W). The maximum observed concentration (C max) increased in an 
approximately dose -proportional manner over the dose range of 0.1 to 15 mg/kg. The area 
under the concent ration -time curve from 0 to 14 days (AUC 0-14) increased in a greater than 
dose-proportional manner over the dose range of 0.1 to 3 mg/kg and increased dose 
proportionally  at ≥ 3 mg/kg. These results suggest MEDI4736 exhibits nonlinear PK likely 
due to satu rable target -mediated CL at doses < 3 mg/kg and approaches linearity at doses ≥ 3 
mg/kg. Near complete target saturation (soluble programmed cell death ligand 1  
[sPD -L1] and membrane bound) is expected with MEDI4736 ≥ 3 mg/kg Q2W. Exposures 
after multiple doses showed accumulation consistent with PK parameters estimated from the 
first dose. In addition, PK simulations indicate that following MEDI4736 10 mg/kg Q2W 
dosing, > 90% of subjects are expected to maintain PK exposure ≥ 40 μg/mL throughout the  
dosing  interval.  
 
As of 09Feb2015, a total of 388 subjects provided samples for ADA analysis. Only 8 of 388 
subjects ([ADDRESS_845374] each in 0.1, 1, 3, and 15 mg/kg cohorts, and 4 subjects in 10 mg/kg cohort) 
were ADA positive with an impact on PK/pharmacodynamics in  [ADDRESS_845375] in the 3 mg/kg 
cohort.  
Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Profile of MEDI4736 Combination Therapy  
 
Study D4190C00006: As of 20Feb2015, MEDI4736 PK (n = 55) and tremelimumab PK (n = 
26) data were available from 10 cohorts (1a, 2a, 3a, 3b, 4, 4a,  5, 5a, 8, and 9) following 
MEDI4736 every 4 weeks (Q4W) or Q2W dosing in combination with tremelimumab Q4W 
regimens. An approximately dose -proportional increase in PK exposure (C max and area under 
the concentration -time curve from 0 to 28 days [AUC 0-28]) of both MEDI4736 and 
tremelimumab was observed over the dose range of 3 to 15 mg/kg MEDI4736 Q4W and 1 to 
10 mg/kg tremelimumab Q4W. Exposures following multiple doses demonstrated

Date: [ADDRESS_845376] treatment. There was no clear relationship between ADA and 
the dose of either MEDI4736 or tremelimumab, and no obvious association between ADA and 
safety or efficacy. MEDI4736 has also been combined with other ant icancer agents, including 
gefitinib, dabrafenib, and trametinib. To date, no PK interaction has been observed between  
MEDI4736 and these agents.  
Safety  
The safety profile of MEDI4736 as monotherapy and combined with other anticancer agents 
was consistent with the pharmacology of the target and other agents in the immune checkpoint 
inhibitor class. No tumor types appeared to be associated with unique AEs.  
Immune -related AEs (irAEs), which are important risks of immune checkpoint inhibitors, 
have been observ ed with MEDI4736 and include colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis/hepatotoxicity, 
neuropathy/neuromuscular toxicity, endocrinopathy, dermatitis, and nephritis. In addition, 
pancreatitis is an important potential risk particularly with MEDI4736 and tremelimumab 
combination therapy. These events are manageable by [CONTACT_213174]/established treatment 
guidelines as described in the study protocols.  
AEs reported with MEDI4736 monotherapy and MEDI4736 and tremelimumab combination 
therapy in key clinical studies are describ ed below.  
 
 
Adverse Event Profile of MEDI4736 Monotherapy  
 
Study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1108: The safety profile of MEDI4736 monotherapy in the 694 
subjects with advanced solid tumors treated at 10 mg/kg Q2W in Study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -
[ADDRESS_845377] received 
MEDI4736 monotherapy (not i ncluding subjects treated with blinded investigational product) 
across the clinical development program. The majority of treatment related  AEs were 
manageable with dose delays, symptomatic treatment, and in the case of events suspected to 
have an immune ba sis, the use of established treatment guidelines for immune -mediated 
toxicity. As of 07May2015, among the 694 subjects treated with MEDI4736 10 mg/kg Q2W in 
Study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1108, a total of 378 subjects (54.5%) experienced a treatment -
related AE, with  the most frequent (occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects) being fatigue (17.7%), nausea

 (8.6%), diarrhea (7.3%), decreased appetite (6.8%), pruritus (6.3%), rash (6.1%), and vomiting 
(5.0%). A majority of the treatment -related AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in sever ity with ≥ 
Grade 3 events occurring in 65 subjects (9.4%). Treatment -related ≥ Grade 3 events reported in 
3 or more subjects (≥ 0.4%) were fatigue (12 subjects, 1.7%); increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST; 7 subjects, 1.0%); increased gamma -glutamyltr ansferase (GGT; 6 
subjects, 0.9%); increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT; 5 subjects, 0.7%); and colitis, 
vomiting, decreased appetite, and hyponatremia (3 subjects, 0.4% each). Six subjects had 
treatment -related Grade 4 AEs (upper gastrointestinal hemor rhage, increased AST, dyspnea, 
neutropenia, colitis, diarrhea, and pneumonitis) and [ADDRESS_845378] had a treatment -related Grade 5 
event (pneumonia). Treatment related  serious adverse events (SAEs) that occurred in ≥ 2 
subjects were colitis and pneumonitis (3 s ubjects each). A majority of the treatment -related 
SAEs were ≥ Grade 3 in severity and resolved with or without sequelae. AEs that resulted in 
permanent discontinuation of MEDI4736 were considered as treatment related in 18 subjects 
(2.6%), with colitis be ing the most frequent treatment -related AE resulting in discontinuation 
(3 subjects). A majority of the treatment -related AEs resulting in discontinuation of MEDI4736 
were ≥ Grade 3 in severity and resolved with or without sequelae.  
 
 
Study D4191C00003/ATLANTIC: The safety profile of MEDI4736 monotherapy in Study 
CD-ON-MEDI4736 -1108 is generally consistent with that of Study D4191C00003/ATLANTIC 
in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic non -small cell  lung cancer (NSCLC) treated w ith 
MEDI4736 10 mg/kg Q2W. As of 05May2015, 264 of 303 subjects (87.1%) reported any AE 
in Study D4191C00003/ATLANTIC. Overall, events reported in ≥ 10% of subjects were 
dyspnea (18.8%), fatigue (17.8%), decreased appetite (17.5%), cough (14.2%), pyrexia 
(12.2%), asthenia (11.9%), and nausea (11.2%). Nearly two -thirds of the subjects experienced 
AEs that were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and manageable by [CONTACT_633194]4736 study protocols. Grade 3 or higher AEs we re reported in 
107 of 303 subjects (35.3%). A total of  
128 subjects (42.2%) reported AEs that were considered by [CONTACT_633195]. Treatment -related AEs (all grades) reported in ≥ 2% of subjects were 
decreased appetite  (6.6%); fatigue (5.9%); asthenia (5.0%); nausea (4.6%); pruritus (4.3%); 
diarrhea, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and pyrexia (3.3% each); rash (2.6%); weight 
decreased (2.3%); and vomiting (2.0%). Treatment -related Grade 3 AEs reported in ≥ 2 subjects 
were pneumonitis (3 subjects) and increased GGT (2 subjects). There was no treatment -related 
Grade 4 or 5 AEs. Ninety -four of 303 subjects (31.0%) reported any SAE. SAEs that occurred 
in ≥ 1.0% of subjects were dyspnea (6.6%); pleural effusion, general phy sical health 
deterioration (2.3% each); pneumonia (2.0%); hemoptysis, pulmonary embolism (1.3% each);

Adverse Event Profile of MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab Combination Therapy  
Study D4190C00006: The safety profile of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab combination 
therapy in the 102 subjects with advanced NSCLC in Study D4190C00006 is generally 
consistent with that observed across 177 subjects treated with MEDI4736 and tremelimumab 
combination therapy (not including subjects treated with blinded investigational product). As 
of 15Apr2015, 95 of 102 subjects (93.1%) reported at least 1 AE. All subjects in the 
tremelimumab 3 and 10 mg/kg dose cohorts experienced AEs; subjects in the MEDI4736 20 
mg/kg and tremelimumab 1 mg/kg Q4W cohort experienced the lowest AE rate (77.8%). 
Treatment -related AEs were reported in 74 of 102 subjects (72.6%), with events occurring in > 
10% of subjects being diarrhea (27.5%), fatigue (22.5%), increased amylase and pruritus 
(14.7% each), rash (12.7%), colitis (11.8%), and increased lipase (10.8%). Treatment -related ≥ 
Grade 3 AEs reported in ≥ 5% of subjects were colitis (8.8%), diarrhea (7.8%), and increased 
lipase (5.9%). Five subjects reported treatment -related Grade 4 events (sepsis, increased ALT, 
and increased AST in [ADDRESS_845382]; increased amylase in 2 subjects; myastheni a gravis in [ADDRESS_845383]; 
and pericardial effusion in [ADDRESS_845384]) and 2 subjects had treatment -related Grade 5 events 
(polymyositis and an uncoded event of neuromuscular disorder [VT]); the Grade [ADDRESS_845385]. There were 2 subjects (both 
in the MEDI4736 20 mg/kg + tremelimumab 3 mg/kg Q4W cohort) with dose -limiting toxicities 
(DLTs): [ADDRESS_845386] with Grade 3 increased amylase 
and Grade 4 increased lipase. Fift y-six subjects (54.9%) reported SAEs, with events occurring 
in > 5% of subjects being colitis (9.8%) and diarrhea (7.8%). Thirty -six subjects (35.3%) 
experienced treatment -related SAEs. Twenty -seven subjects (26.5%) permanently discontinued 
treatment due t o AEs. Treatment -related AEs resulting in discontinuation in ≥ 2 subjects were 
colitis (7 subjects), pneumonitis (5 subjects), diarrhea (3 subjects), and increased AST (2 
subjects).  
 
Efficacy  
Partial efficacy data are available for 2 monotherapy studies ( CD-ON-MEDI4736 -1108 
andD4190C00007) and 2 combination therapy studies (CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1161 and 
D4190C00006). Clinical activity has been observed across the 4 studies.

mg/kg Q 2W were evaluable for response (defined as having ≥ 24 weeks follow -up, 
measurable disease at baseline, and ≥ 1 follow -up scan, or discontinued due to disease 
progression or death without any follow -up scan). In PD -L1 unselected patients, the objective 
response rate (ORR), based on investigator assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, ranged from 0% in uveal melanoma (n = 23) to 20.0% in

1.3 Research hypothesis  
Our hypothesis is that neoadjuvant therapy with anti -PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736 
in combination with anti -CTLA -4 monoclonal antibody tremelimumab will result in favorable 
alterations of the intratumoral immunologic environment in subjects undergoing resectional 
surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MP M).

 1.4 Rationale for conducting this study  
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive malignancy of the pleura that is 
associated with prior exposure to asbestos and is fatal in most cases. The tumor most 
commonly arises within the parietal pleura and spreads locally to the ipsilateral visceral 
pleura, lung, chest wall, diaphragm, pericardium, and mediastinum. Treatment with standard 
cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens, including cisplatin and pemetrexed, results in an extension 
of the me dian survival t ime to 12 months, compared with cisplatin alone (Vogel zang, 2003 ). 
For patients with disease confined to the ipsilateral hemithorax, surgical resection combined 
with systemic or intracavitary chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or other local modalities, 
has been offered with reports of more optimistic outcomes. The operative procedures most 
commonly used in these multimodal approaches include the following: extrapleural 
pneumonectomy (EPP), which involves en bloc resection of the lung, pericardium, diaphr agm, 
visceral, and parietal pleura; and pleurectomy/decortication (P/D), which involves resection of 
the visceral and parietal pleura with or without resection of the pericardium and/or diaphragm 
(Rice et al., 2011 ). Nonetheless, the majority of these pati ents will suffer from recurrence and 
ultimately succumb to the disease ( Rusch et al., 2012; Sugarbaker et al., 2014 ). There is a 
clear need for better systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_633152].  
The blockade of negative regulatory signals to T -cells, such as PD -L1 and cyt otoxic T -
lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA -4), has shown promising clinical activity. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a 
monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA -4 and prevents the interaction of CTLA -4 with cluster 
of differentiation (CD) 80 and CD86, which results in enhanced T -cell activation and 
proliferation (Lipson et al., 2011). Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_633154] (Hodi et al., 2010), and was granted [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approval in 2011 for the treatment of met astatic melanoma.  
PD-L1 (B7 homolog 1 [B7 H1], CD274) is part of a complex system of receptors and ligands 
that are involved in controlling T -cell activation. In normal tissue, PD -L1 is expressed on T 
cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, mes enchymal stem cells, bone marrow -
derived mast cells, and in various non -hematopoietic cells (Keir et al., 2008). The normal 
function of PD -L1 is to regulate the balance between T -cell activation and tolerance through the 
interaction with two receptors, pro grammed death 1 (PD -1, CD279) and CD80 (B7 -1). In the 
tumor microenvironment, PD -L1 expressed on tumor cells binds to PD -1 on activated T cells, 
which delivers an inhibitory signal to those T cells, preventing them from killing target tumor 
cells and thus protecting the tumor from immune elimination (Zou et al., 2008). In the clinic, 
antibody -mediated blockade of PD -L1 induced durable tumor regression (objective response 
rate of 6 to 17%) and prolonged stabilization of the disease (rates of 12 to 41% at 24 weeks) in 
patients with advanced cancers, including non -small -cell lung cancer, melanoma, and renal -cell

 cancer (Brahmer et al., 2012). Similarly, treatment with anti -PD-1 antibodies produced 
objective responses in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non -small -cell lung 
cancer, melanoma, or renal -cell cancer (Topalian et al., 2012).  
Pre-clinical data and clinical research suggests that the concurrent targeting of immunologic 
checkpoints may generate superior anti -tumor activity when compa red with a single -agent 
checkpoint blockade, which may translate into higher and more durable rates of response. 
Mouse data indicate that the mechanisms of activation of sites known to be involved in the 
activity of CTLA -[ADDRESS_845390] additive or synergistic activity (Pardoll, 2012). For example, in mouse tumor models, the 
combination of PD -[ADDRESS_845391] alo ne (Curran et al., 2010; Duraiswamy et al., 2013 ). Notably, 
in models of murine melanoma, anti -PD-1 blockade increased the expression of CTLA -4 on 
intratumoral T cells, and reciprocally, CTLA -4 blockade increased PD -1 expression on 
intratumoral T cells, su ggesting one potential mechanism for the increased efficacy of dual 
checkpoint therapy (Curran et al., 2010). The concurrent administration of monoclonal 
antibodies to CTLA -4 (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) and PD -1 (nivolumab) was recently evaluated in a Phase I 
trial that showed impressive preliminary evidence of improved benefit in advanced melanoma 
patients. The overall response rate was 53% at the maximum tolerated dose. Three patients 
presented with a complete response (CR), and all responding patients experienced a ≥80 % 
decline in tumor burden at 12 weeks (Wolchok et al., 2013).  
MPM has recently been recognized as an immunogenic tumor, and durable clinical responses 
to immunotherapy have been obtained in the laboratory setting (Tan et al., 2014; Adusumilli 
2014; Adusumi lli et al., 2014; Fridlender et al., 2009; Anraku et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2012). In 
murine models of MPM, for example, CTLA -4 blockade results in significant anti -tumor 
responses (Wu et al., 2012). In the clinic, tremelimumab has shown encouraging clinica l activity 
and an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in patients with advanced MPM who have been 
previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy (Calabro et al., 2013).  
The effects of PD -L1 or CTLA -4 blockade on the tumor microenvironment in humans are 
largely unknown. At Baylor College of Medicine, we surgically treat 2 -4 patients with MPM 
per week, and are therefore uniquely positioned to study this disease. This phase II, window of 
opportunity, neoadjuvant trial in patients with surgically resecta ble MPM  will 
comprehensively characterize the influence of MEDI4736 and the combination therapy of 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab on the local immunologic environment of the tumor, as well as 
the systemic blood and bone marrow compartments. Our primary objective will be a 
comparison of the CD8/Treg ratio, the percent age of ICOS+ CD4 T cells, and the tissue

 expression of PD -1, PD -L1, and CTLA -4 before and after the delivery of the 
immunotherapeutic agent(s).  
Our hypothesis  is that neoadjuvant therapy with anti -PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736 
in combination with anti -CTLA -4 monoclonal antibody tremelimumab will result in favorable 
alterations of the intratumoral immunologic environment in subjects undergoing resectional 
surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). The primary objective  of this study will 
be comparison of the ratio of intratumoral cytotoxic T cells to regulatory T cells (CD 8/Treg) 
before and after treatment with combination MEDI -4736 and Tremelimumab checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy . In vitro, an antibody that blocks the interaction between PD -L1 and its 
receptors can relieve PD -L1-dependent immunosuppressive effects and enhance  the cytotoxic 
activity of anti -tumor T -cells ( Blank et al., 2006 ). The ratio of CD8 T cells to regulatory T 
cells (CD8/Treg) is increased by [CONTACT_633193] -4, PD -1, or PD -L1 within B16 mouse 
melanoma tumors ( Curran et al., 2010 ), and this ratio is p redictive of therapeutic efficacy in 
this model ( Quezada et al., 2006 ). Importantly, combination therapy with CTLA -4 and PD -1 
increases the CD8/Treg ratio more significantly than monotherapy ( Curran et al., 2010 ). In a 
recent report of melanoma patients un dergoing PD -[ADDRESS_845392] an increase in the number of intratumoral CD8 T cells 
following drug delivery ( Tumeh et al., 2014 ), suggesting that PD -[ADDRESS_845393] 
been correlated with improved prognosis in MPM ( Anraku et al., 2008 ) and a number of other 
malignancies, including colorectal, melanoma, and lung cancer ( Pagès et al., 2010 ), which 
further su ggests that an intratumoral CD8 T -cell response is beneficial to patients.  
Based on these findings, w e expect that  the addition of tremelimumab to MEDI4736 in 
patients with MPM will result in an increased percentage of intratumoral CD4 T cells that 
expres s ICOS. Treatment with anti -CTLA -4 antibodies in  patients with melanoma or bladder 
cancer has resulted in a significant increase of blood ICOS+ CD4 T cells (  Ng Tang et al., 
2013; Liakou et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009; Vonderheide et al., 2010 ). Notably, this 
statistically significant increase in ICOS+ CD4 blood T cells was seen after one dose of the 
drug ( Ng Tang et al., 2013 ). In addition, i t has been reported that a sustained increase in the 
frequency of ICOS+ CD4 T cells was correlated with a clinical benefit in patients with 
melanoma undergoing anti -CTLA -4 therapy ( Carthon et al., 2010 ). More over, in patients 
undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer who received 2 doses of the anti -CTLA -4 
antibody ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], a significant increase in the percentage of ICOS+ CD4 T cells was seen 
in the tumor tissues ( Liakou et al., 2008 ). 
We additionally hypothesize that the addition of tremel imumab to MEDI4736 will increase 
the tumor expression of PD -L1, which  provid es a potential mechanism for the imp roved

Date: [ADDRESS_845394] range of human malignancies, 
up to 88% in some cancers . In a number of these cancers, including lun g (Mu et al., 2011 ), 
renal ( Krambeck et al., 2007 ), pancreatic ( Nomi et al., 2007 ), and ovarian cancer ( Hamanishi 
et al., 2007 ), the expression of PD -L1 is associated with reduced survival and an unfavorable 
prognosis. PD -LI is expressed in a substantial p roportion of MPM tumors (21% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_633155] 74% of non -epi[INVESTIGATOR_633156]) , and its expression is associated with a 
decreased overall survival ( Mansfield et al., 2014 ). Although  it appears that the selection of 
patients based on PD -L1 expr ession within the tumor microenvironment may improve the 
probability and/or quality of responses to PD -[ADDRESS_845395] -targeting agents, there remain a 
number of patients with PD -L1-negative tumors that respond to the blockade with the PD -LI 
inhibitor MEDI4736 (Brahmer et al., 2014 ). Further more , the expression of PD -L1 may not 
have as much of an impact  when a combination of checkpoint inhibitors is utilized. For 
example, a study investigating the combination of a PD -1 inhibitor (nivolumab) and a CTLA -
4 inhibito r (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) in patients with melanoma suggested that the combination of CTLA -

1.5 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment  
Benefits /risk associated with MEDI473 6 
 
Clinical activity has been observed across the 2 monotherapy studies (CD -ON-MEDI4736 -
1108 and D4190C00007) and 2 combination therapy studies (CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1161 and 
D4190C00006) for which partial efficacy data are available.  
 
• Study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1108: Overall, 456 of 694 subjects treated with MEDI4736 10 
mg/kg Q2W were evaluable for response (defined as having ≥ 24 weeks follow -up, 
measurable disease at baseline, and ≥ 1 follow -up scan, or discontinued due to disease 
progression or death without any follow -up scan). In PD -L1 unselected subjects, the ORR, 
based on investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1, ranged from 0% in uveal melanoma (n = 
23) to 20.0% in bladder cancer (n = 15), and DCR -24w ranged from 4.2% in TNBC (n = 24) 
to 39.1% in advanced cuta neous melanoma (n = 23). PD -L1 status was known for [ADDRESS_845398] for 
bladder cancer, advanced cutaneous melanoma, HCC (n = 3 each, 33.3% each), NSCLC (n = 
86; 26.7%), and SCCH N (n = 22; 18.2%). In the PD -L1-positive subset, DCR -24w was

• Study D4190C00007: Of the [ADDRESS_845400] overall responses 
were mCR in 4 subjects (19.0%); SD in 4 subjects (19.0%); and PD in 5 subjects (23.8%). The 
remaining 8 subjects ( 38.1%) did not meet the criteria for CR, mCR, PR, SD, or PD at the date 
of assessment.  
 
• Study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1161: Of the 65 subjects with metastatic or unresectable 
melanoma treated with the combination of MEDI4736 and BRAFi/MEKi, 63 subjects were 
evaluable for response. A total of 35 subjects (55.6%) had a best overall response of 
confirmed or unconfirmed PR. The confirmed and unconfirmed DCR (CR + PR + SD) for ≥ 
12 weeks was 79.4%.  
 
• Study D4190C00006: Of the [ADDRESS_845401] 16 weeks of follow -up were 
evaluable for response (defined as  
measurable disease at baseline and at least 1 follow -up scan; this included discontinuations 
due to disease progress ion or death without follow -up scan). Of the 63 evaluable subjects, 17 
(27%) had a best overall response of PR, 14 (22%) had SD, 22 (35%) had PD, and 10 (16%) 
were not evaluable. The ORR (confirmed and unconfirmed CR or PR) was 27% and the DCR 
(CR, PR, or SD) was 49% as assessed by [CONTACT_393] v1.1.  
 
Benefit/risk  associated with tremelimumab:  
In the clinical development program of tremelimumab and that of the related anti -CTLA -4 
mAb, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], a pattern of efficacy has emerged that appears to be consistent across tumor 
types. Response rates are generally low (~10%); however, in those subjects who respond, the 
responses are generally durable, lasting several months even in subjects with aggressive 
tumors (e.g., refractory metastatic melanoma). In a  large Phase 3 study of tremelimumab 
versus DTIC/temozolomide in subjects with advanced melanoma, the median OS was 12.6 
months for tremelimumab versus 10.7 months for DTIC/temozolomide (HR = 1.1416, p = 
0.1272).  
The safety profile across the tremelimumab nonclinical and clinical programs is dominated by 
[CONTACT_44859] -mediated reactions that can result in an inflammatory response. The important 
potential risks for tremelimumab that require further evaluation in clinical studies are 
immune -mediated gastrointestinal  events such as colitis, endocrinopathies, dermatitis, 
pancreatitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, neurotoxicities, cytopenias, and nonimmune -mediated 
infusion -related reactions, anaphylaxis and serious allergic reactions. Adverse events similar 
to those reporte d with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_633157], with diarrhea (40%), pruritus (23%), rash (22%), nausea (22%), 
and fatigue (17%) being the most common (Kirkwood et al, 2010). Grade 3 or higher AEs

Potential risks associated with tremelimumab include i mmune -mediated gastrointestinal 
events including colitis, intestinal perforation,  abdominal pain, dehydration, nausea  and 
vomiting, and decreased appetite (anorexia) ; immune -mediated dermatitis including urticaria, 
skin exfoliation, and dry skin ; immune -mediated endocrinopathies including hypophysitis, 
adrenal insufficiency, and  hyper - and hypothyroidism ; immune -mediated  hepatitis including 
autoimmune hepatitis, and increased serum alanine  aminotransferase and aspartate

including thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia ; infusion -related reactions, anaphylaxis, 
and serious allergic reactions ; and  headache, fatigue, and pyrexia . 
 
Benefit s/risks associated with combination treatment:  
A total of [ADDRESS_845402] been treated, with 3 subjects each receiving 1 mg/kg 
tremelimumab and 3 mg/kg MEDI4736 Q4W, 1 mg/kg tremelimumab and 10 mg/kg

tremeli mumab and 10 m g/kg MEDI4736 Q4W , 3 mg/kg tremelimumab and 15 mg/kg 
MEDI4736 Q4W , and 10 mg/kg tremelimumab and 15 mg/kg MEDI4736 Q4W. Overall, 
subjects have received between 0 and 7 doses of investigational products.  
Across all dose cohorts, 17 of 18 subjects (94.4%) re ported at leas t 1 AE (regardless of 
causality ). The most frequently reported (> 3 subjects) AEs (all grades) were fatigue, pruritus, 
increased amylase, and arthralgia. Treatment -related AEs were reported in 13 of 18 subjects 
(72.2%). Of the 13 subjects, 4 had Grade 1, 3 had Grade 2, and 6 had ≥ Grade 3 events as 
maximum severity. Treatment -related Grade 3 events that occurred in 2 or more subjects were 
fatigue (6 subjects), increased amylase (4 subjects); diarrhea, nausea, and increased alanine 
aminotransfe rase (3 subjects each); and abdominal pain, colitis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_59378], 
vomiting, increased aspartate aminotransferase, decreased appetite, and arthralgia (2 subjects 
each). No consistent pattern in the nature, dose -relationship, frequency, or severity  of AEs has 
been noted with escalating doses of the combination.  
 
Nine subjects have reported 15 SAEs (Table [IP_ADDRESS] -2). None of the preferred terms were 
reported in more than [ADDRESS_845403]. The majority of the SAEs were Grade 3 or higher in severity. 
Half of  the SAEs were considered related to investigational products. Three subjects with 
SAEs of disease progression, colitis, and malignant neoplasm progression, respectively, 
permanently discontinued investigational products due to these events. The event of m alignant 
neoplasm progression, considered not related to investigational products, resulted in death. In

3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Overview of  study design  
Subjects with MPM will undergo surgical mediastinal lymph node biopsy (cervical 
mediastinoscopy) and simultaneous surgical biopsy of the pleural tumor by [CONTACT_633187], at 
which time tumor tissue (at least 2 g) and peripheral blood will be collected for the  study. These 
procedures are performed as our standard of care in the treatment of these subjects. The subject 
will be randomized. Three days  to three weeks after the biopsy, 20  evaluable  subjects  (if tissue 
obtained)  will be randomly treated with either MEDI -4736 alone (15 mg/kg once intravenously) 
(n=8) or MEDI -4736 (1500 mg once intravenously) plus tremelimumab (75 mg once 
intravenously) (n=8), or a control group (n=4)  in a randomized controlled study design. There 
will be two treatment arms (MEDI4736 only and combination MEDI4736+tremelimumab) and 
one untreated arm (control). Randomization, stratified by [CONTACT_633196], will be performed and will help to minimize patient selection biases between three arms.  
Subjects under 30 kg will be treated with weight -based dosing for both MEDI4736 and 
Tremelimumab combination therapy. These patients are excluded from fixed based dosing to 
limit endotoxin exposure from the drug preparations. One to six weeks after the infusion, 
subjects will undergo resectional surgery, including extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) or 
pleurectomy/decortication (P/D), at which time the tumor will be removed (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 200 -1000 
g) and obtained for study. Four patients that do not undergo treatment with MEDI -4736 or  
tremelimumab will be included as controls. Blood will be obtained after the induction of general 
anesthesia for both the thoracoscopy procedure and the EPP or P/D resectional procedure, as is 
routinely done in these procedures. The sixth rib will be obtai ned at the time of the resection.

Page 52 of 134 
 In use storage and stability  
Total in -use storage time from needle puncture of MEDI4736 vial to start of administration 
should not exceed 4  hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2 -8°C (36 -46°F). If in -use 
storage time exceeds these limits, a new dose must be prepared from new vials. Infusion 
solutions must be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to commencement of 
administration. MEDI4736 does not contain preservatives and any unused portion must be 
discarded.  
5.1.2 Doses and treatment regimens  
Subjects will be administered a 15 mg/kg intravenous dose of  MEDI4736 once during the  
study.   
5.1.[ADDRESS_845421] to 
achieve the accurate dose according to Appendix A.  
Preparation of infusion bags  
The preparation of infusion bags should be done under aseptic conditions by [CONTACT_31809]; it should not be prepared on the ward.  
An additional volume of 0.9% (w/v) saline equal to the calculated volume of MEDI4736 to be 
added to the IV bag must be rem oved from the bag prior to addition of MEDI4736.  
The calculated volume of MEDI4736 is then added to the IV bag, and the bag is mixed by 
[CONTACT_471385].  
Prior to the start of the infusion, ensure that the bag contents are at room temperature to avoid 
an infusion reaction due to the administration of the solution at low temperatures.  
Vials should be used for specific subjects and should not be shared between subjects . 
5.1.4 Dose administration  
MEDI4736 will be adminis tered at room temperature (approximately 25°C  ) by [CONTACT_62655] a peripheral vein.

Page 53 of 134 
 Following preparation of MEDI4736, the entire contents of the IV bag should be administered 
as an IV infusion over approximately 60 minute s (±5 minutes), using a 0.2 -μm in -line filter.  
The IV line will be flushed with a volume of normal saline equal to the priming volume of the 
infusion set used after the contents of the IV bag are fully administered, or complete the 
infusion according to i nstitutional policy to ensure the full dose is administered and document 
if the line was not flushed.  
Since the compatibility of MEDI4736 with other IV medications and solutions, other than 
normal saline (0.9% [weight/volume] sodium chloride for injection ), is not known, the 
MEDI4736 solution should not be infused through an IV line in which other solutions or 
medications are being administered.  
5.1.5 Monitoring of dose administration  
Subjects will be monitored during and after the infusion with assessment of vi tal signs at the 
times specified in the Schedule of Assessment (see Section 6.2)  
In the event of a ≤Grade  2 infusion -related reaction, the infusion rate of study drug may be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event (up to 4 hours) and  re-initiated at 
50% of the initial rate until completion of the infusion.  For subjects with a ≤Grade 2 
infusion -related reaction, subsequent infusions may be administered at 50% of the initial 
rate. Acetaminophen and/or an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydra mine) or equivalent 
medications per institutional standard may be administered at the discretion of the 
investigator.  If the infusion -related reaction is ≥Grade [ADDRESS_845422] immediate  access to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition to the 
ability to admit subjects to an intensive care unit if necessary.  
5.1.6 Accountability and dispensation

 5.8 Toxicity Management  
5.8.1 MEDI4736  
For adverse events (AEs) that are considered at least partly due to administration of 
MEDI4736 the following dose adjustment guidance may be applied:  
• Treat each of the toxicities with maximum supportive care (including holding the 
agent suspected of causing the toxicity where required).  
If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, consideratio n should be given 
to continuing the same dose of MEDI4736 along with appropriate continuing 
supportive care.  
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which MEDI4736 should be permanently 
discontinued.  
 
Based on the mechanism of action of MEDI4736 l eading to T -cell activation and proliferation, 
there is the possibility of observing immune related Adverse Events (irAEs) during the 
conduct of this study. Potential irAEs include immune -mediated enterocolitis, dermatitis, 
hepatitis, and endocrinopathies.  Subjects should be monitored for signs and symptoms of 
irAEs. In the absence of an alternate etiology (e.g., infection or PD) signs or symptoms of 
enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathy should be considered to be immune -
related.   
In add ition, management guidelines for adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are detailed 
in Section 10.1.3 . All toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03.

General Considerations  
Dose Modifications  Toxicity Management  
Drug administration modifications of study drug/study 
regimen will be made to manage potential immune -related 
AEs based on severity of treatment -emergent toxicities 
graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03.  
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of 
study drug/study regimen based on CTC grade/severity 
(table below), permanently discontinue study drug/study 
regimen for the following conditions:  
• Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a d ose of 
≤10 mg of prednisone per day (or equivalent) 
within [ADDRESS_845427] dose of study 
drug/study regimen  
• Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 
treatment -related AE following resumption of 
dosing  
Grade 1  No dose modification  
Grade 2  Hold stu dy drug/study regimen dose until 
Grade 2 resolution to Grade ≤1.  
If toxicity worsens, then treat as Grade 3 or 
Grade 4.  
Study drug/study regimen can be resumed 
once event stabilizes to Grade ≤1 after 
completion of steroid taper.  
Patients with endocrinopath ies who may 
require prolonged or continued steroid 
replacement can be retreated with study 
drug/study regimen on the following 
conditions:  
1. The event stabilizes and is controlled.  
2. The patient is clinically stable as per 
Investigator or treating physician’s 
clinical judgement.  
3. Doses of prednisone are at ≤10  mg/day 
or equivalent.  It is recommended that manage ment of immune -mediated 
adverse events (imAEs) follows the guidelines presented in 
this table:  
− It is possible that events with an inflammatory or 
immune mediated mechanism could occur in 
nearly all organs, some of them not noted 
specifically in these guide lines.  
− Whether specific immune -mediated events (and/or 
laboratory indicators of such events) are noted in 
these guidelines or not, patients should be 
thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative 
etiology (e.g., disease progression, concomitant 
medicati ons, and infections) to a possible 
immune -mediated event. In the absence of a clear 
alternative etiology, all such events should be 
managed as if they were immune related. General 
recommendations follow.  
− Symptomatic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_633160] -grade (Grade 1 or 2, unless 
otherwise specified) events.  
− For persistent (>3 to 5 days) low -grade (Grade 2) 
or severe (Grade ≥3) events, promptly start 
prednisone 1 to 2  mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent.  
− Some events with high likelihood for morbidity 
and/or mortality – e.g., myo -carditis, or other 
similar events even if they are not currently noted 
in the guidelines – should progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_633161] (methylprednisolone at 2 
to 4 mg/kg/day) even if the event is Grade 2,  and 
if clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_27551]/or there has been 
clinical confirmation. Consider, as necessary, 
discussing with the study physician, and promptly 
pursue specialist consultation.  
− If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid 
tapering (28  days of  taper), increase the 
corticosteroid dose (prednisone dose [e.g., up to 2 
to 4 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent]) until 
stabilization or improvement of symptoms, then 
resume corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate 
(>28  days of taper).  
− More potent immunosuppr essives such as TNF 
inhibitors (e.g.,  infliximab) (also refer to the 
individual sections of the imAEs for specific type

 Pediatric Considerations  
Dose Modifications  Toxicity Management  
The criteria for permanent discontinuation of study 
drug/study regimen based on CTC grade/severity is the 
same for pediatric patients as it is for adult patients, as 
well as to permanently discontinue study drug/study 
regimen if unable to reduce corticoste roid ≤  a dose 
equivalent to that required for corticosteroid 
replacement therapy within [ADDRESS_845428] dose of 
study drug/study regimen  − All recommendations for specialist consultation 
should occur with a pediatric specialist in the 
specialty recommend ed. 
− The recommendations for dosing of steroids (i.e., 
mg/kg/day) and for IV IG and plasmapheresis that are 
provided for adult patients should also be used for 
pediatric patients.  
− The infliximab 5 mg/kg IV dose recommended for 
adults is the same as recommen ded for pediatric 
patients ≥ [ADDRESS_845429].  
− For pediatric dosing of mycophenolate mofetil, 
consult with a pediatric specialist.  
− With long -term steroid and other immunosuppressive 
use, consider need for PJP prophylaxis, 
gastrointestinal protection, and glucose monitoring.

 Diarrhea/Colitis  Any Grade  General Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− Monitor for symptoms that may 
be related to diarrhea/enterocolitis 
(abdominal pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or 
changes in bowel habits such as 
increased frequency over baseline 
or blood in stool) or related to 
bowel perforation (such as sepsis, 
peritoneal signs, and ileus).  
− Patients should be thoroughly 
evaluated  to rule out any 
alternative etiology (e.g., disease 
progression, other medications, or 
infections), including testing for 
clostridium difficile toxin, etc.  
− Steroids should be considered in 
the absence of clear alternative 
etiology, even for low -grade 
even ts, in order to prevent 
potential progression to higher 
grade event.  
− Use analgesics carefully; they can 
mask symptoms of perforation 
and peritonitis.

frequency of <4 
over baseline per 
day) 
(Colitis: 
asymptomatic; 
clinical or 
diagnostic 
observations 
only)  No dose modifications.  For Grade 1:  
− Monitor closely for worsening 
symptoms.  
− Consider symptomatic treatment, 
including hydration, electrolyte 
replacement, dietary changes 
(e.g., American Dietetic 
Association colitis diet), and 
loperamide. Use probiotics as per 
treating physician’s clinical 
judgment.  
Grade 2  
(Diarrhea: stool 
frequency of 4 to 
6 over baseline 
per day) (Colitis: 
abdominal pain; 
mucus or blood  
in stool)  Hold study drug/study 
regimen until resolution 
to Grade ≤1  
• If toxicity worsens, 
then treat as Grade 3 
or Grade 4.  
• If toxicity improves 
to Grade ≤1, then 
study drug/study 
regimen can be 
resumed after 
completion of steroid 
taper.  For Grade 2:  
− Consider symptomatic treatment, 
including hydration, electrolyte 
replaceme nt, dietary changes 
(e.g., American Dietetic 
Association colitis diet), and 
loperamide and/or budesonide.  
− Promptly start prednisone 1 to 2

Non-specific symptoms include 
headache, fatigue, behavior 
changes, changed mental status, 
vertigo, abdominal pain, unusual 
bowel habits, polydipsia, polyuria, 
hypotension, and weakness.  
− Patients should be thoroughly 
evaluated to  rule out any 
alternative etiology (e.g., disease 
progression including brain 
metastases, or infections).  
− Depending on the suspected 
endocrinopathy, monitor and 
evaluate thyroid function tests: 
TSH, free T3 and free T4 and 
other relevant endocrine and 
related labs (e.g., blood glucose 
and ketone levels, HgA1c).  
− For modest asymptomatic 
elevations in serum amylase and 
lipase, corticosteroid treatment is 
not indicated as long as there are 
no other signs or symptoms of 
pancreatic inflammation.  
− If a patient experiences an AE that 
is thought to be possibly of 
autoimmune nature (e.g., 
thyroiditis, pancreatitis, 
hypophysitis, or diabetes 
insipi[INVESTIGATOR_27562]), the investigator should 
send a blood sample for

Peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes  
(such as Guillain -Barre 
and myasthenia gravis)  Any Grade  General Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− The prompt diagnosis of immune -
mediated peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes is important, since 
certain patients may unpredictably 
experience acute decompensations 
that can result in substantial 
morbidity or in the worst case, 
death. Special care should be 
taken for certain sentinel 
symptoms that may predict a more 
severe outcome, such as 
prominent dysphagia, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_118392], and signs 
of respi[INVESTIGATOR_62621].  
− Patients should be evaluated to 
rule out any alternative etiology 
(e.g., disease progression, 
infections, metabolic syndromes 
or medications). It should be 
noted that the d iagnosis of 
immune -mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes can be 
particularly challenging in 
patients with underlying cancer, 
due to the multiple potential 
confounding effects of cancer 
(and its treatments) throughout the 
neuraxis. Given the importance o f 
prompt and accurate diagnosis, it 
is essential to have a low

of screening and must agree to continue using such precautions for [ADDRESS_845437] also use male 
condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point 
should be discussed  with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity is an 
acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal 
method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female patients should refrain from 
breastfe eding and egg cell donation throughout this period . 
• Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (i.e., 
bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or 
postmenopausal (defined as 12 mo nths with no menses without an alternative medical 
cause).  
• Effective methods (including highly  effective methods) of contraception are described in 
Table 5. A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low 
failure rate (ie , less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note that not 
all methods in Table 1 are considered highly effective.  
• Non-sterilized male subjects who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing 
potential must use male condom plus spermicide  (see Table 5) from screening through [ADDRESS_845438] dose of 
combination therapy with MEDI4736 and tremelimumab . Not engaging in sexual activity 
is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the 
withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.  Male pati ents should 
refrain from sperm donation throughout this period. F emale partners of a male subject 
must  use an effective method of contraception throughout this period.

7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Subject s with MPM who are eli gible for the study will be enrolled. Subject s first will undergo 
surgical mediastinal lymph node biopsy (cervical mediastinoscopy) and simultaneous surgical 
biopsy of the pleural tumor by [CONTACT_633187], at which time tumor tissue ( goal of 2 g, which is 
generally available ) and [ADDRESS_845441] s will receive either MEDI 4736 (15 mg/kg once intrave nously)  or 
MEDI 4736 ( 1500 mg  once intravenously) + tremel imumab ( 75 mg  once intravenously) . 
Subjects under [ADDRESS_845442] s will undergo resectional surgery including extrapleural pneumo nectomy or 
pleurectomy/decortication at which time the tumor will be removed (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 200 -1000g) and 
obtained for study. Blood  (25ml)  also will  be obtained for study . In addition,  the six th rib will 
be extracted  at the time of the resectional procedure, as is routinely done during  these 
procedures . After the removal of the tumor, our standard protocol (in the presence of 
conserved renal function) includes intraoperative heated chemotherapy using a lavage of

followed  for at least [ADDRESS_845443] read, understand, and sign the IRB/REB/IEC -approved ICF 
before any study -specific screening procedures are performed. After signing the ICF, 
completing all screening procedures, and being deemed eligible for entry, subjects will be 
enrolled in the study. Procedures that are performed prior to the signing of the ICF and are 
considered standard of care may be used as screening assessments if they fa ll within the [ADDRESS_845444] a clinical diagnosis of MPM  (based upon CT, 
and/or PET -CT, and or MRI radiographic findings)  but not all subject s will have had this 
diagnosis confirmed by a tissue biopsy. In either case patients undergo thoracoscopy to assess 
resectability of disease, and to obtain tissue or additional tissue, when necessary, for 
diagnosis. Thoracoscopy will  be performed in these subject s after signing the ICF.  
The following procedures will be performed during the Screening  Visit : 
• Informed Consent  
• Review of eligibility criteria  
• Medical history and demographics  
• Complete physical exam  
• ECOG Performance Status

surgical mediastinal lymph node biopsy (cervical mediastinoscopy) to evaluate nodal status and 
simultaneous surgical biopsy of the pleural tumor by [CONTACT_633202] , at 
which time tumor tissue (at least 2 g) and peripheral  blood (25ml) will be collected for the study. 
These procedures are performed as our standard of care in the treatment of these subject s. The 
thoracoscopy procedure is part of our standard of care in both in subject s who have had a 
previous tissue biopsy a nd those who have not had a previous biopsy. It is performed to 
determine resectability of the tumor and to obtain tissue to confirm tissue diagnosis.  In subject s 
who are consented to the study who have a suspected (clinical) diagnosis of MPM but not a 
tissue diagnosis, if the thoracoscopy procedure reveals that the subject  does not have MPM, 
then these subject s will be removed from the study and their tissue and blood samples will be 
destroyed. These subject s will be replaced in the study.  
Three days  to three weeks later subject s will be treated with either MEDI4736 (15 mg/kg once 
intravenously) or MEDI4736  (1500 mg  once intravenously) + tremel imumab ( 75 mg  once 
intravenously) . Subjects under [ADDRESS_845446] s will undergo resectional surgery including extrapleural

7.3 Biological sampling procedures  
Biological samples will be collected at two primary time points during the study. Tumor tissue 
(gene rally, at least 2 grams) and peripheral blood (25ml) will be collected during pre -
treatment surgical mediastinal lymph node biopsy (cervical mediastinoscopy) and 
simultaneous surgical biopsy of the pleural tumor by [CONTACT_633187]. One to six weeks after 
treatment, subject s will undergo resectional surgery, including extrapleural pneumonectomy 
or pleurectomy/decortication, at which time the tumor will be removed (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 200 -1000g) 
and blood (25ml) will be collected for the study.  
7.3.1 Biomarker /Pharmacodynamic sampling and evaluation methods  
Tissue biomarker immune response  to MEDI4736 or MEDI4736 + tremel imumab will be 
determined on tissue and blood collected before and after the administration of the study drug(s) , 
or in patients not receiving study drugs . The tissue biomarker immune responses that will be 
evaluated in this study include CD8/Treg ratios, percentage of ICOS+ CD4 T cells, and immune 
cell expression of PD -L1. CD8/Treg rations and percenta ge of ICOS+ CD4 T cells will be 
compared with CyTOF (time -of-flight mass cytometry) and/or flow cytometry.  Tumor PD -L1 
expression will be determined by [CONTACT_9064]. CyTOF  and/or flow cytometry  will 
be used to compare PD -L1 expression on specific i mmune cell and non -immune cell 
populations.  
Bone marrow biomarker immune response will also be assessed. Bone marrow will be collected 
from a routinely resected sixth rib during the surgical resection scheduled post -treatment with 
MEDI4736 or MEDI4736 + tr emelimumab , or in patients not receiving study drugs. A 
comprehensive evaluation of immune cell composition and phenotype with CyTOF will be 
conducted on bone marrow tissue as well as tumor tissue and peripheral blood. Appendix C 
details the complete CyTOF  panel that will be used for each individual specimen.

 7.3.2 Estimate of volume of blood to be collected  
Blood samples will be drawn at two points: during the thoracoscopy procedure and during the 
resection procedure (P /D or EPP). In both cases, the sample will be drawn immediately after 
the induction of general anesthesia via a radial arterial catheter that is routinely placed for 
these procedures. A total of 50 cc will be drawn in the study (25 -cc per time point).   
7.3.3 Fresh tumor biopsies  
Fresh tumo r biopsies will be sampled from patients at two time points during the study. Prior 
to treatment with the study drug(s), patients will undergo surgical mediastinal lymph node 
biopsy (cervical mediastinoscopy) and simultaneous surgical biopsy of the pleural  tumor by 
[CONTACT_633203], at which time tumor tissue ( generally  2 g) will be 
collected . One to six weeks after study drug(s) infusion , patients will undergo resectional 
surgery including extrapleural pneumonectomy or pleurectomy/deco rtication under general 
anesthesia, at which time the tumor will be removed (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 200 -1000 g) and obtained for 
study. These biopsied tissues will be used to determine tissue biomarker immune response to 
MEDI4736 or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab using CyTOF as described in Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_845450] withdraws consent to the use of donated samples, the samples will be disposed 
of/destroyed, and the action documented. As collection of the  biological samples is an integral 
part of the study, then the subject is withdrawn from further study participation.  
The Principal Investigator:  
• Ensures that biological samples from that subject, if stored at the study site, are 
immediately identified, disposed of /destroyed, and the action documented  
• Ensures the laboratory(ies) holding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn 
consent immediately and that samples are disposed/destroyed, the action documented 
and the signed document ret urned to the study site  
• Ensures that the subject is informed about the sample disposal.

9. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_397641].  
9.1.1 Safety Parameters  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of adverse events  
The International Conference on Harmoni zation  (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) E6 (R1) defines an AE as:  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship  with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal p roduct.  
An AE includes but is not limited to any clinically significant worsening of a subject’s 
pre-existing condition. An abnormal laboratory finding (including ECG finding) that requires 
an action or intervention by [CONTACT_093], or a finding judged  by [CONTACT_95106] a change beyond the range of normal physiologic fluctuation, should be reported as 
an AE.  
Adverse events may be treatment emergent ( i.e., occurring after initial receipt of 
investigational product) or nontreatment emergent. A nontreatment -emergent AE is any new 
sign or symptom, disease, or other untoward medical event that begins after written informed 
consent has been obtained but before the subject has received investigational product.  
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was scheduled prior to 
the subject being enrolled into the study) for a documented pre -existing condition, that did not 
worsen from ba seline, is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical

 event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE.  
The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs.  
9.1.2 Definition  of serious adverse event s 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i .e., screening, run-in, 
treatment, wash -out, follow -up), at any dose of the study drugs that fulfils one or more of the 
following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18973]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect  in offspring of the subject  
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardi ze the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding 
whether expedited rep orting is appropriate in this situation. 
Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; or development of dr ug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
The causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study treatment/procedures) will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_093](s) and communicated to [COMPANY_008].  
9.1.[ADDRESS_845453]  (AESI)  
Adverse events of spe cial interest (AESIs) are events of scientific and medical interest specific 
to the further understanding of the MEDI4736 and tremelimumab safety profile and require 
close monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_68477]. MEDI4736 and 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Tremelimumab  
Study Number ESR -14-[ADDRESS_845454].  
MEDI4736, an anti -PD-L1 antibody, and tremelimumab, an anti -CTLA -4 antibody both  
belongs to a new class of anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], called “checkpoint -inhibitors” that amplify 
antitumor immune responses by [CONTACT_633204] e co-
inhibitory or co -stimulatory receptors, PD-1 and  CTLA -4 and, expressed on T cells (Callahan 
and Wolchok, 2013). This class of drugs can have a wide spectrum of immune -mediated 
reactions that have been considered inflammatory in nature and can affect any organs of the 
body. Based on this mechanism of action of MEDI4736 and related molecules Adverse events 
of special interest include immune -mediated reactions such as enterocolitis, dermatitis, 
hepatotoxicity or hepatitis, endocrinopathy, neuropathy and pneumonitis  as well as infusion 
related reactions, serious allergic reactions and anaphylaxis.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pneumonitis  
Immune -mediated pneumonitis is characterized by [CONTACT_633205]-target effects of checkpoint inhibitors against 
the normal lung parenchyma. (Chow, 2013) Presentations of pneumonitis range from 
asymptomatic lung infiltrates to a mimic of severe bacterial pneumonia. For symptomatic 
patients, complaints and findings m ay include dyspnea, cough, tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, 
and hypoxia.  
Because pneumonitis can quickly escalate and become fatal, early recognition is essential. 
Initial workup includes chest imaging; however, pneumonitis can have highly variable 
appeara nces on chest CT scans. In patients with pulmonary metastases or cardiopulmonary 
comorbidities, evaluation can be particularly challenging as it can be difficult to differentiate 
between infection, early pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, immune -mediate d 
pneumonitis, immune -related tumor inflammation, and tumor progression (Topalian et al, 
2012). Pneumonitis has also been reported as a complication of cancer treatment associated 
with lung and breast cancer.

 As of the DCO dates for the IB, pneumonitis inc luding ILD was reported at a frequency rate 
of Common (44/1645; 2.7%). Most were non -serious and Grade 1 or 2 in severity. CTC Grade 
3 pneumonitis was reported in 7 patients (0.4%); CTC Grade 4 in 2 patients (0.1%) and CTC  
Grade 5 pneumonitis in 2 patients  (0.1%). CTC Grade 3 ILD was reported in 3 patients 
(0.2%). There were no CTC Grade 4 or 5 events of ILD.  
 
In the durvalumab + tremelimumab combination in patients receiving 20 mg/kg durvalumab 
iv Q4W and 1 mg/kg tremelimumab, pneumonitis including ILD was  reported at a frequency 
of Common (14/560; 2.5%). Most events were CTC Grade 1 or 2. CTC Grade 3 pneumonitis 
was reported in 3 patients (0.5%). There were no reports of CTC Grade 4 or 5 pneumonitis 
reported and no Grade 3 or higher ILD events in the combi nation patients.  
 
Presentations of pneumonitis can range from asymptomatic lung infiltrates to those that mimic  
severe bacterial pneumonia (Teply and Lipson 2014). Early consideration of pneumonitis  
should be reali zed when patients present with new onset o r worsening of respi[INVESTIGATOR_633168]. Prompt treatment with steroids is important as per 
current established toxicity management guidelines.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion -Related Reactions, Anaphylaxis and Allergic Reactions  
Adverse reactions that occ ur during or shortly after infusion may include fever, chills,  
hypotension, dyspnoea, tachycardia, cyanosis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], urticarial and pruritus,  
angioedema, hypotonia, arthralgia, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, fatigue, 
headache,  hypertension rash, headache, flushing, sweating, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, 
unresponsiveness,  and haemodynamic instability. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_633169] [ADDRESS_845455] or second exposure to the agent, but 
between 10% and  30% occur during subsequent treatments (Lenz 2007).  
 
Anaphylaxis is a systemic, immediate hypersensitivity reaction that is mediated by 
[CONTACT_633206]; these interactions result in an 
antigenantibody  reaction. Clinical manifestations of acute allergic reactions may range from 
localised  skin reactions at the injection site to AEs, which can include,  but are not limited to, 
those events   similar to infusion -related reactions to severe reactions including anaphylaxis, 
and drug  hypersensitivity syndromes, These reactions may be more common  
with higher rates of infusion, and in patients with a history of allergies.  
Across the durvalumab monotherapy and durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy  
programme 37 (2.2%) and 11 (2.0%) patients respectively have experienced either an infusion  
related reaction or hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction . The majority of events were CTC  
Grade 1 or 2 with 5 patients experiencing a CTC Grade 3 event of infusion related reaction 
and 1 patient with a CTC Grade 4 event of drug hypersensitivity (all receiving durvalumab  
monotherapy). There have been no reported  CTC Grade [ADDRESS_845456] been no reported events of cytokine release syndrome in the ongoing durvalumab 
+/- tremelimumab studies.  
 
Immune -complex disease  
The potential risk of immune co mplex disease for  
durvalumab is theoretical based on the known risk associated with mAbs and other proteins.  
The incidence of durvalumab ADA -positive patients in clinical studies is low, and hence the  
risk of immune complex disease is likely to be low.  
 
Specifically, of 1124 patients who were treated with durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W and 
evaluable  for the presence of ADAs, 3.3% (37/1124) patients tested positive for treatment -
emergent  ADAs. Neutralising antibodies against durvalumab were detected in 0.3% (3/1124) 
patients.  The presence of ADAs did not have a clinically relevant effect on PK. In 
combination with  tremelimumab the incidence is 4/60 patients (Study D4190C00006). Studies 
with tremelimumab also showed a low incidence of ADA. There have been no r eported events 
of immune complex reactions in patients receiving durvalumab monotherapy or in 
combination  with tremelimumab.  
 
Considering the low incidence of immunogenicity of durvalumab and tremelimumab and the  
lack of clinically apparent immune complex disease to date, samples for ADA monitoring 
may be collected in studies if clinical AEs consistent with immune complex disease are 
observed.  
 
For guidance on identifying, evaluating, and treating an imAE please see the toxicity  
management guidelines includ ed in each of the study protocols.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatic function abnormalities (hepatotoxicity)  
Immune -mediated hepatitis/hepatic toxicity is the inflammation of the liver. Hepatic AEs  
induced by [CONTACT_4002] -1/PD -L1 inhibitors commonly present as asymptomatic increase of AST a nd 
ALT, rarely total bilirubin. A proportion of patients may be presenting with fatigue, fever and  
radiologic appearances including hepatomegaly, periportal lymphadenopathy and periportal  
oedema (Zhang et al 2016).  
As a grouped term, selected hepatic events including laboratory abnormalities were reported at  
Clinical Study Protocol

 a frequency of 15.1% (248 patients) across [ADDRESS_845457] received durvalumab  
monotherapy 10 mg/kg Q2W. Hepatitis events (autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis toxic,  
hepatocellular injur y, hepatotoxicity and hepatitis acute) were reported at a frequency rate of  
Uncommon (14 patients; 0.9%). For 9 of the 14 patients, the events of hepatitis were CTC  
Grade 3 in severity. There were no Grade 4 events. One patient experienced a CTC Grade 5  
event of autoimmune hepatitis. Other AESIs such as hepatic failure (5 patients), jaundice (4  
patients) and laboratory abnormality AESIs have been observed, two of which resulted in a  
fatal outcome (CTC Grade 5 hepatic failure and hyperbilirubinaemia). With  the durvalumab +  
tremelimumab combination patients, there were two reports of hepatitis, 1 CTC Grade 1  
hepatitis (1 of 560 patients; 0.2%) and 1 CTC Grade 3 autoimmune hepatitis (0.2%) both of  
which were considered treatment -related by [CONTACT_365651]. Additionally, there was  
1 report of non treatment -related Grade 2 hepatic failure.  
Monitoring liver function tests while receiving study medication is important as hepatitis often  
manifests as asymptomatic elevated levels of hepatic transaminases (ALT, AST, bilirubin;  
Kim et al 2013). Prompt treatment with steroids is important as per current established toxicity  
management guidelines.  
In Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -treated patients, clinical manifestations of hepatitis included nonspecific 
symptoms of mild fever, general weakness, fatigue, nausea and/or abdominal pain. In the 
absence of clinical symptoms, treatment -emergent hepatitis presented asymptomatically as 
elevated hepatic transaminases. Ultrasonograms of the liver can appear normal or may 
demonstrate homoge nous hepatomegaly, edema, or enlarged perihepatic lymph nodes. Biopsy 
of the liver most commonly shows a diffuse T -cell infiltrate. Other reported pathology 
patterns include inflammation focused around either hepatocytes or bile ducts.  
If subject presents  with liver dysfunction, a high suspi[INVESTIGATOR_633170], 
however, it is important to distinguish treatment -related toxicity and rule out other causes of 
hepatic injury, such as infection, preexisting medical conditions, immunosuppression,  
metabolic or cardiovascular derangements, other medications, or tumor progression.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rash/ Dermatitis  
 
Immune -mediated dermatitis is generally mild and presents as mild local or diffuse 
maculopapular,  erythematous rash on the trunk or extremities, which may be accompanied by 
[CONTACT_99407],  alopecia, and vitiligo, suggestive of inflammatory response to melanocytes

 (Lacouture et al  2014). In rare cases, severe dermatitis has been reported to manifest as 
Stevens -Johnson  syndrome, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_281179] l necrolysis, or rashes complicated by [CONTACT_633207],  bullous, or haemorrhagic manifestations (Tarhini 2013, Kaehler et al 
2010).  
 
AESIs of rash (as a composite term) were reported as Very common in 199 (12.1%) patients  
receiving durvalumab  monotherapy and Very common in 124 (22.1%) patients receiving the  
combination. The majority of events were CTC Grade [ADDRESS_845458] been reported at a 
frequency of Very  common (n=237; 14.4%) in monotherapy treated patients and patients 
receiving durvalumab +  tremelimumab combination (n=114; 20.4%). However, most events 
were CTC Grade 1 in  severity with 3 patients a nd 4 patients experiencing CTC Grade 3 events 
in the monotherapy  and combination treated groups respectively.  
 
Prompt treatment with steroids (topi[INVESTIGATOR_299587]) is important as per  
current established toxicity management guidelines.  
Pathologic evaluations of biopsy specimens of affected skin often demonstrate eosinophilic 
infiltration or leukocytoclastic vasculitis; or, they may reveal a lymphocytic predominance 
characterized by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells, sometimes with tropi[INVESTIGATOR_633171] -contain ing cells. 
Specifically, in metastatic melanoma patients, the rash associated with immune -checkpoint 
inhibitors may be indicative of immune response to melanocytes and may progress to vitiligo 
in some cases. Biopsies showed severe dermatitis with papi[INVESTIGATOR_633172], sometimes 
accompanied by [CONTACT_633208].  
Guidelines for the management of subjects with immune -mediated events including dermatitis 
are outlined in Section 6.6.1.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Colitis  
Diarrhoea is the most frequent AESI reported across the Phase I to Phase III clinical studies  
with durvalumab monotherapy, as of the DCO dates for this IB with a frequency of Very  
common (263/1645; 16.0%) in patients receiving 10 mg/kg durvalumab iv Q2W. Most of 
thesewere CTC Grade 1 in seve rity. Treatment -emergent colitis -type AESIs were reported at a

 frequency of Common (16 of 1645 patients; 1.0%). Most were CTC Grade 2 or 3. CTC Grade 
4 colitis was reported in 1 patient (rare; <0.1%).  
 
In the durvalumab + tremelimumab combination in patien ts receiving 20 mg/kg durvalumab 
iv Q4W and 1 mg/kg tremelimumab, diarrhoea was reported at a frequency of Very common  
(144/560; 25.7%) with most CTC Grades 1 or 2. Colitis was reported at a frequency of  
Common (26/560; 4.6%). Most colitis events were CTC Grade 3 reported in 17 of the 26  
patients on the combination. There were no CTC Grade 4 or 5 cases reported in the  
combination patients.  Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis or 
diarrhoea.  
 
Investigators are instructed to begin d iarrhoea management early to minimise the risk of 
colitis (please refer to the toxicity management guidelines in the study protocols). Early 
initiation of diarrhea treatment guidelines has been shown to reduce bowel perforation and 
colectomy rates, drug -related diarrhoea, and serious gastrointestinal imAEs by [CONTACT_8622] 50% in 
patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Tarhini 2013).  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Endocrinopathy (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297])  
Immune -mediated endocrinopathy is the inflammation of any organ in the hypothalamic  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] - adrenal axis, but is most typi[INVESTIGATOR_280488], thyroid and/or 
adrenal glands in patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors, leading to  
hypophysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297], thyroid dysfunction, and/or adrenal insufficiency (Teply and  
Lipson 2014). The clinical presentation of immune -mediated endocrinopathies most often  
include hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and nonspecific symptoms of headache and fatigue,  
but may also include myalgias, visual field defects, behavioural changes, electrolyte  
disturbances, loss of appetite and hypotension (Tarhini 2013). Patients will generally have  
abnormal endocrine laboratory test results that include thyroid -stimulating hormone, free T4,  
total and free T3, cortisol, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, luteinising hormone, 
folliclestimulating hormone, and testosterone.  
 
Most endocrinopathy events reported were CTC Grade 1 or 2. In the monotherapy pool CTC  
Grade 3 events consisted of adrenal insufficiency (2 patients), hypoph ysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297]  
(1 patient), hyperthyroidism (1 patient) and hypothyroidism (2 patients). There were no CTC  
Grade 4 or 5 events. In the combination pool there was a slightly increased incidence of  
higher -grade events of adrenal insufficiency with 3 patients experiencing CTC Grade 3 and 1 
patient with CTC Grade 4 in severi yy. There was 1 patient with CTC Grade 3 
hyperthyroidism  
and 1 patient with CTC Grade 3 hypophysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297].

guidelines.  
Type 1 diabetes mellitus  
Type I diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disorder characterised by [CONTACT_633209] s, culminating in absolute insulin deficiency. The majority of cases are attributable to  
an autoimmune -mediated destruction of beta cells (type 1a) while a small minority of cases  
results from an idiopathic destruction or failure of beta cells (type 1b) (M aahs et al 2010).  
Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is the most common term describing patients  
with a type 2 diabetic phenotype combined with islet antibodies and slowly progressive 
betacell failure. Evidence on the occurrence of LADA in relatio n to adult Type I diabetes 
mellitus in the general population is usually estimated, due, in part, to limited availability of 
diagnostic criteria for the LADA (Leslie et al 2006).  
 
Across the monotherapy and combination pool of studies there have been no re ported events 
of type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, 1 patient receiving durvalumab monotherapy in an 
ongoing phase III randomised clinical study outside of the pooled dataset (<0.1%) experienced 
Grade 3 type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient, a 60 year old Caucasian male with NSCLC 
without a history of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia, developed severe autoimmune -
mediated hyperglycemia (blood glucose 458 mg/dL) 43 days after starting durvalumab, was 
tested positive for anti -GAD antibody 322 U/mL (reference  range 0 to 5 U/mL) and was 
negative for B -islet antibody. He was diagnosed with type [ADDRESS_845459]. The type 1 diabetes mellitus was treated with insulin and resolved with 
sequelae (insulin dependency).  
 
For patients with suspe cted diabetes mellitus investigators should obtain an endocrinology  
consult and institute appropriate management which may include the administration of insulin.  
Also please refer to the endocrinology section of the toxicity management guidelines in the  
study protocols.  
 
Nephritis  
The major clinical syndromes produced by [CONTACT_44859] -mediated renal injury include nephrotic  
syndrome, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_103020], and acute renal failure (Cunard and Kelly  
2003). In association to immune -checkpoint inhibitors, two different forms of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_633173], acute kidney injury due to predominant acute  
granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome in lupus nephritis (Izzedine  
et al 2014). Signs  and symptoms include increase in serum creatinine, decrease in urine 
output, peripheral oedema, haematuria, loss of appetite.  
 
As a grouped term, selected renal events including laboratory abnormalities were reported at a

 frequency of 5.3% (87 patients) a cross the 1645 patients included in the durvalumab  
monotherapy pool. Nephritis events were reported at a frequency rate of Uncommon (5 
patients; 0.3%) with 1 CTC Grade 2 autoimmune nephritis, 1 CTC Grade 2 
glomerulonephritis, 2 CTC Grade 2 nephritis and 1 CTC Grade 3 tubulointerstitial nephritis. 
There was 1 CTC Grade 3 nephritis reported in the 560 (0.2%; Uncommon) patients in the 
durvalumab + tremelimumab combination pool. An additional AESI of acute kidney injury 
was reported in 26 patients (1.6%) receiv ing durvalumab monotherapy and 7 patients (1.3%) 
in the combination pool, 1 of which was CTC Grade 5 in severity; the event was considered 
not treatment -related by [CONTACT_9673].  
 
Patients should be monitored for changes in renal function (eg,  that manifest as elevated 
serum  blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, decreased creatinine CL, electrolyte imbalance, 
decrease in  urine output, or proteinuria and any other findings that may be indicative of 
nephritis) prior to   and periodically during trea tment. Prompt treatment with steroids is 
important as per current  established toxicity management guidelines in the study protocols.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Neuropathy/Neuromuscular Events (to include MG and GB)  
Neuromuscular toxicity is relatively uncommon but may manifest as a  mild peripheral sensory  
neuropathy or muscle weakness. Although they are rare, severe neuropathies and myopathies  
have been observed. Emergent cases of neuropathy can present with Guillain -Barré syndrome,  
transverse myelitis, or myasthenia gravis, among other diagnoses. Depending on presentation,  
patients may require neuroimaging, nerve conduction studies, and, potentially, nerve or 
muscle  biopsy to arrive at the diagnosis (Teply and Lipson 2014). Isolated cases of 
myasthenia gravis  have been report ed in studies combining anti -PD-1/PD -L1 mAb with anti -
CTLA -4 mAb (  Naidoo et al 2015).  
 
As of the DCO for this IB there have been no reports of Guillain -Barre syndrome or  
Myasthenia Gravis in patients receiving durvalumab monotherapy. Two patients receivin g the  
durvalumab + tremelimumab combination have reported a case of Myasthenia Gravis but 
none  at the recommended dose of 20 mg/kg durvalumab iv Q4W and 1 mg/kg tremelimumab.  
 
Prompt treatment of these conditions as per current toxicity management guidelines is  
important. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms that may include peripheral  
sensory neuropathy, muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy including numbness, tingling, 
and 
sensitivity to touch.

potentially, nerve or muscle biopsy to arrive at the diagnosis.  
Pancreatitis  
Pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas that typi[INVESTIGATOR_633177]. Clinical presentation frequently includes low -grade abdominal pain with 
accompanying fever and malaise (Weber et al 2012, Di Giacomo et al 2010). Biopsies showed 
diffuse T -cell infiltrate consistent with immune -mediated pancreatitis (Weber et al 2012).  
 
Across the 1645 patients in the monotherapy progra m, events of pancreatitis were Uncommon  
to rare. Two patients (0.1%) experienced pancreatitis (CTC Grade 3 and Grade 4 in severity)  
and 1 patient (<0.1%) with CTC Grade 3 acute pancreatitis. Elevations in amylase and lipase  
were reported at a frequency rate of Common (0.4% and 0.4%, respectively). In ongoing  
sponsored studies with durvalumab + tremelimumab therapy in 560 patients, events of  
pancreatitis were Uncommon; pancreatitis was reported in 4 patients (0.7%) with 3 of these  
CTC Grade 3 in  severity and acute pancreatitis in 1 patient (0.2%). Elevations in amylase and  
lipase were reported at a frequency of Common (6.1% and 7.0%, respectively).  Patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis including Grade 3 or 4 elevatio ns 
in lipase and/or amylase.  
 
Prompt treatment of this condition as per current established toxicity management guidelines 
is important.

Serious Infections  
Serious and/or ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_845460] been  reported in clinical studies with durvalumab, 
but are often confounded by [CONTACT_633210] (ie, 
steroids and other immunosuppressives) that ma y cause opportunistic infections. As of the 
DCO, events from the MedDRA Infections and Infestations  SOC, events with a severity 
≥Grade 3 and frequency of ≥1% included lung infection  (n=16; 1%), pneumonia (n=39; 
2.4%), sepsis (n=26; 1.6%) and urinary tract infection   (n=20; 1.2%). CTC Grade 3 events 
were reported in 98 patients (6.0%), CTC Grade 4 events  were reported in 25 patients (1.5%) 
and CTC Grade 5 infection events in 15 patients (0.9%).  Across the durvalumab +

 of ≥1% included lung infection (n=9; 1.6%), pneumonia (n=14; 2.5%),  sepsis (n=6; 1.1%) and 
urinary tract infection (n=9; 1.6%). CTC Grade 3 events were reported  in 50 patients (8.9%), 
CTC Grade 4 events we re reported in 2 patients (0.4%) and CTC Grade 5  infection events in 4 
patients (0.7%). Patients should be monitored for serious infections while  
receiving durvalumab.  
 
9.2 Assessment of safety parameters  
9.2.1 Assessment of severity  
Severity will be graded accordin g to the NCI CTCAE v4.03.The determination of severity for 
all other events not listed in the CTCAE will be made by  [CONTACT_633211] 1 to 5 as  
defined below.  
Grade 1 (mild)   An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal  
 treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not 
 generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
 
Grade 2 (moderate)   An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific  
 therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual 
 activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no 
 significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
 
Grade 3 (severe)   An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. T he 
 event interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
 affects the clinical status of the subject.  
 
Grade 4 (life threatening)  An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with  
 an imminent risk of death or with physical o r mental disabilities 
 that affect or limit the ability of the subject to perform activities 
 of daily living (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc.). 
 
Grade 5 (fatal)   Death (loss of life) as a result of an event.  
 
 
It is important to distinguish between s erious criteria and the severity of an AE. Severity is a 
measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 10.1.2. A Grade 
[ADDRESS_845461], possible etiologies, and whether the event meets criteria of an SAE and therefore 
requires immediate notifi cation to [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Patient Safety.  
The following variables will be collected for each AE  associated with the investigational 
product : 
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date when the AE started and stopped  
• Changes in NCI CTCAE grade and the maximum CTC grade attained  
• Whether the AE is serious or not  
• Investigator causality rating against MEDI4736  (yes or no) , tremelimumab (yes/no)  
• Action taken with regard to MEDI4736 /tremelimumab  
• Outcome  
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs associated with the 
investigational product as applicable:  
• Date AE met criteria for serious AE  
• Date Investigator became aware of serious AE  
• AE is serious due to

Events that  are unequivocally due to disease progression will not be reported as an AE during 
the study.  
9.3.[ADDRESS_845462] will be 
recorded  from  the time of signature [CONTACT_43998], throughout the  treatment period and 
including the follow -up period ([ADDRESS_845463] dose of MEDI4736 ). 
During the course of the study all AE s and SAEs associated with the investigational product 
will be proactively followed up for each  subject . Every effort will be made to obtain a 
resolution for all events, even if the events  continue after discontinuation/study completion.  
If a subject disco ntinues from treatment for reasons other than disease progression, and 
therefore continues to have tumor assessments, drug -related SAEs must be captured until the 
patient is considered to have confirmed PD and will have no further tumor assessments.  
The in vestigator is responsible for following all SAEs associated with the investigational 
product until resolution, until the subject  returns to baseline status, or until the condition has 
stabilized with the expectation that it will  remain chronic, even if this extends beyond study 
participation.  
Follow -up of unresolved adverse events  
Any AEs associated with the investigational product that are unresolved at the subject’s last 
visit in the study are followed up by [CONTACT_633212], but 
without further recording in the adverse event log . After [ADDRESS_845464] -related SAEs will continue to be followed for safety.

If a non -serious AE associated with the investigational product becomes serious, this and 
other relevant follow -up information must also be provided to [COMPANY_008] and the FDA.  
Serious adverse events  associated with the investigational product  that do not require 
expedited re porting to the FDA still need to be reported to [COMPANY_008] preferably using the 
MedDRA coding language for serious adverse events. This information should be reported on 
a monthly basis and under no circumstance less frequently than quarterly.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of deaths  
All deaths that occur during the study, or within the protocol -defined [ADDRESS_845469] be reported as follows:  
• Death that is clearly the result of disease progression should be 
documented but should not be reported as an SAE.  
• Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the 
disease under study, the AE causing the death must be reported to as 
a SAE within 24 hour s (see Section 10.3.2  for further details). The 
report should contain a comment regarding the co -involvement of 
progression of disease, if appropriate, and should assign main and 
contributory causes of death.   
• Deaths with an unknown cause should always be  reported as a SAE.   
Deaths that occur following the protocol -defined [ADDRESS_845470]-dose of MEDI4736 safety

 9.3.4 Other events requiring reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overdose  
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of MEDI4736  or tremelimumab in excess 
of that specified in the Investigator’s Brochure, unless otherwise specified in this protocol.  
Any overdose of a study subject with MEDI4736  or tremelimumab , with or without associated 
AEs/SAEs, is required to be reported within 24  hours of knowledge of the event to the sponsor 
and [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Patient Safety or designee using the designated Safety  e-
mailbox (see Section  10.3.[ADDRESS_845471] informatio n). If the overdose results in an AE, the AE 
must also be recorded as an AE (see Section 10.3). Overdose does not automatically make an 
AE serious, but if the consequences of the overdose are serious, for example death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is seri ous and must be recorded and reported as an SAE (see Section 
10.1.2  and Section  10.3.2 ). There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose 
of MEDI4736  or tremelimumab .  
The investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose  of MEDI4736 or MEDI4736 
+ tremelimumab . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatic function abnormality  
Hepatic function abnormality (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) in a study subject, with or 
without associated clinical manifestations, is required to be reported as “hepatic funct ion 
abnormal” within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to the sponsor and 
[COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Patient Safety using the designated Safety e-mailbox  (see Section 
10.3.[ADDRESS_845472] information), unless a definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality  
(e.g., cholelithiasis or bile duct obstruction) that is unrelated to investigational product has 
been confirmed.  
• If the definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality has been established and is unrelated 
to investigational product, the decision to c ontinue dosing of the study subject will be based on 
the clinical judgment of the investigator.  
• If no definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality is established, dosing of the study 
subject must be interrupted immediately. Follow -up investigations and inquiries must be 
initiated by [CONTACT_38238].

 Each reported event of hepatic function abnormality will be followed by [CONTACT_633213] /MedImmune .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
Pregnancy itself, or preg nancy of a subject’s partner, is not regarded as an adverse event 
unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_633178] a contraceptive medication. Congenital abnormalities/birth defects 
and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions 
without complications should not be handled as AEs.  The outcome of any conception 
occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_845473] dose (spontaneous 
miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) 
should be followed up and documented even if the subject was withdrawn from the study.   
Pregnancy in a female subject who has recei ved investigational product is required to be 
reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event  to the sponsor and 
[COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Patient Safety  or designee using the designated Safety  e-mailbox  
(see Section 10.3.[ADDRESS_845474] information).  
Subject s who become pregnant during the study period must not receive additional doses of 
investigational product but will not be withdrawn from the study. The pregnancy will be 
followed for outcome of the mother and child (including any premature terminations) a nd 
should be reported to [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Patient Safety  or designee after outcome.  
Male subjects should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 
[ADDRESS_845475] this should be reported within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event  to [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Patient Safety or designee using the 
Safety Fax Notification Form for contact [CONTACT_3031]). The sponsor will endeavor to collect 
follow -up information on such pregnancies provided the partner of the study sub ject provides 
consent.  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Tremelimumab  
Study Number ESR -14-[ADDRESS_845476] on surgically resectable MPM patients. All 
subjects will b e randomized  after the mediastinoscopy + thoracoscopy  to one of the three arms 
to receive MEDI4736+tremelimumab, MEDI4736 only, or untreated control. The primary 
endpoint will be the ratio of intratumoral cytotoxic T cells to regulatory T cells (CD8/Treg) 
before and after treatment.  The secondary endpoints are the percentage of inducible T -cell co -
stimulator (ICOS) positive intratumoral CD4 T cells and tumor tissue expression (Ventana 
assay) of programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) before and after each treatm ent. Overall and 
recurrence -free survival will be  also measured as the secondary endpoint. These analysis will 
be post -protocol analysis based upon data obtained from the standard of care follow up in our 
post-surgical patients. All subjects will undergo surgical resection One to six weeks after the 
infusion.  
10.1 Sample size  
10.2 The primary objective is  comparison of the ratio of CD8/Treg before and after 
treatment with combination MEDI4736+Tremelimumab. A total of 20 evaluable 
subjects (if tissue obtained) will be enrolled in this study for 24 months and 8 
subjects will be assigned to combination MEDI47 36+Tremelimumab (8 subjects to 
MEDI4736 only and 4 subjects to control). The outcome of interest in this study is a 
change in ratio of CD8/Treg before and after treatment with combination 
MEDI4736+Tremelimumab within subjects. There are no data available t o estimate 
a change of ratio of CD8/Treg before and after the treatment but in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_87544] 6 subjects with MPM the log transformed ratio of CD8/Treg was 
approximately normally distributed with a mean of 1.94(6.96 in raw scale) and 
standard deviatio n of 0.808(2.24 in raw scale). Assuming that repeat values are 
moderately correlated(r=0.5), then the difference between before and after the 
combination treatment will also have a standard deviation of 0.808(2.24 in raw 
scale). We estimate that we will ha ve 80% power (alpha=5%, a paired t -test) to 
detect an increased log ratio CD8/Treg of 2.87(17.71 in raw scale) after the 
combination treatment with 8 subjects.  
10.3 Analysis plan  
There will be two treatment arms (MEDI4736 only and combination 
MEDI4736+tremelimu mab) and one untreated arm (control). Randomization, stratified by 
[CONTACT_633192], will help to minimize patient selection biases 
between three arms. Preliminary tests will be performed to assess whether our data is normally 
or non -normally distributed. Patient characteristics will be summarized descriptively. Baseline 
characteristics will be compared by [CONTACT_15500]. For our primary objective that 
compares outcome variable in tissues before and after treatment with combinati on MEDI4736

 APPENDIX A : MEDI4736 DOSE CALCULATIONS  
MEDI4736 Dosin g 
The MEDI4736 dosing should be done depending on subject weight:  
1. Cohort dose: X mg/kg  
2. Subject weight: Y kg  
3. Dose for subject: XY mg = X (mg/kg) × Y (kg)  
4. Dose to be added into infusion bag:  
Dose (mL) = XY mg / 50 (mg/mL) where 50 mg/mL is MEDI4 [ADDRESS_845508] tenth mL (0.1 mL). 
Dose adjustments for each cycle only needed for greater than 10% change in weight.  
5. The theoretical number of vials required for dose preparation is the next greatest whole 
number of vials from the following formula:  
Number of vials = Dose (mL) / 10 (mL/vial)  
Example:  
1. Cohort dose: 10 mg/kg  
2. Subject weight: [ADDRESS_845509]: 800 mg = 10 (mg/kg) × 80 (kg)  
4. Dose to be added  into infusion bag:  
Dose (mL) = 800 mg / 50 (mg/mL) = 16.0 mL  
5. The theoretical number of vials required for dose preparation:  
Number of vials = 16.0 (mL) / 10 (mL/vial) = 2 vials

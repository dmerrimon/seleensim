Summary of Changes Document – Clinical Protocol  
In November 2015 the STYLE Clinical Trial Protocol— Rev A, August 21, 2015 was modified to Rev B, 
November 24, 2015. This document highlights the changes that were made in the revision.  
 
1. Blinding (Section 5.3) : we adjusted the document to accurately reflect which parties are 
blinded and unblinded in carrying out the protocol. Given that a no- fat control is 
currently a group w ithin the study and it is unfeasible to disguise this treatment relative  to 
a fat containing arm, the sponsor, data management personnel (CRO), and study  monitors 
will be aware of which treatment the subject received. It is imperative to note that the 
above parties have no potential impact in either the outcome or risk profile as core 
analysis (e.g., global and macrophotography) will remain conducted by [CONTACT_373285]. It should also be noted that the statistician working to analyze the data will 
also remain  blinded. 
 
2. Questionnaires (Sections 8, 9.6, & Appendix A): we adjusted the protocol to remove 
inconsistencies with the timing of both investigator and subject questionnaires. Both of 
these questionnaires (attached in the correspondence) are not relevan t for any pre - 
procedure assessment as they reflect perceived changes subsequent to the intervention. As such, the sections of the document reflecting this timing have been amended accordingly. This change has no potential impact in either the outcome asse ssment or risk 
profile of the  protocol.  
 
3. Timing of visit (Sections 9.1 & Appendix A): the original protocol called for acquisition of both global and macrophotography at Day - 1. In the course of working 
with the approved vendor (Canfield Scientific), it be came evident that this time period 
would not allow adequate time to monitor for the quality of the images obtained. As  such, 
we are proposing that both global and macro photography is acquired at least one month and no later than one week prior to the sche duled intervention to allow for this critical 
quality assessment. With this change, we are eliminating one round of global photography. This change has no potential impact in either the outcome assessment or risk profile of the  protocol.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Cytori Celution

2 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Alopecia  Androgenetica  
 
Alopecia Androgenetica (AGA) is the most common form of both male pattern hair loss (MPHL) 
and female pattern hair loss (FPHL)1,2 with the condition affecting approximately 50% of the 
male population and less than 45% of women going through life with a full head of hair. The 
degree of hair loss in the male patient is generally classified using the Norwood Hamilton 
Classification (Figure 1)  and FPHL is evaluated based on the Savin scale (Figure 2)1,3. The 
incidence and prevalence of the condition are generally well documented in both genders. Stough 
and co -workers reported that in White males, 30% have AGA by [CONTACT_654] 30 and 50% by [CONTACT_654] 50 with 
lower incidences seen in African American, Chinese, and Japanese populations3. In a population 
based report looking at MPHL, the authors reported that in the 30- 35 years age group, grade I 
hair loss was 51%, while grade II was 43% and grade VI was only approximately 19% --clearly 
highlighting early hair loss in the younger population4. Of the 1,005 men in the study aging from 
30-50 year s, 44% were found to have grades I -III hair loss. 
 
In women, diffuse thinning and loss of hair density with maintenance of the frontal hairline describe the typi[INVESTIGATOR_373256]5. In one report, the prevalence of early, clinically detectable 
FPHL was 12 % of females between 20 -29 years of age and 25% by 49 years of age
2. In the table 
presented below (Table 1) , Gan and Sinclair documented the distribution of hair loss in 752 
women using a modif ied 5- point grading scale6. Below the age of 40 years, 99% of women 
reporting loss documented early stage loss.  
 
 
In sum, a significant percentage of both male and female population suffer from AG at a 
relatively early age. 

STYLE; Version A 
[ADDRESS_467184] 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 54   Figure 1 —MPHL Norwood Hamilton Classification  
 
 
 
Class I represents an adolescent or juvenile hairline and it not actually balding. The adolescent 
hairline generally rests on the upper brow crease.  
 
Class II indicates a progression to the adult or mature hairline which sits a finger breath (1.5cm) 
above the upper brow crease, with some temporal recession. This also does not represent balding.  
 
Class III is the earliest stage of male hair loss. It is characterized by a dee pening temporal recession.  
 
Class III Vertex represents early hair loss in the crown (vertex).  
 
Class IV Is characterized by [CONTACT_373288], but there is still a solid band of hair across top separating front and vertex . 
 
Class V the bald areas in the front and crown continue to enlarge and the bridge of hair separating the two areas begins to break down.  
 
Class VI occurs when the connecting bridge of hair disappears leaving a single large bald area on the front and top of the scalp. The hair on the sides of the scalp remains relatively high.

[ADDRESS_467185] 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 54   Figure 2 —FPHL Ludwig Scale  
 
The current treatment regimen for alopecia androgenetica is a spectrum ranging from non - 
invasive medicinal approaches to robot -assiste d surgical transplantation of thousands of 
follicular units. On the non- invasive side, the two medicines currently approved for treatment of 
genetic pattern alopecia by [CONTACT_373289] (for men only) and minoxidi l8,9. Both of these 
medicines carry untoward side -effects. For finasteride, sexual dysfunction, particularly for the 
younger patient who is most likely to present with early hair loss, was seen in between 2.1% and 
3.8% of men10. Initial treatment of early alopecia is typi[INVESTIGATOR_257316] -invasive and the two 
medications approved by [CONTACT_373290]. For minoxidil, it is 
reported that approximately one -third of patients with AA respond with new hair growth11. In 
contrast, invasive transplant options are generally not offered to patients with early AA and if so, 
require significant financial resources. As a result, there remains a significantly large gap between these medicinal and  transplant options. Hence a distinct medical need remains specific 
to addressing early  alopecia.  
During hair follicle growth (anagen), the hair follicle delves deep into the rich dermal 
macroenvironment as it grows to maturity where it is surrounded by [CONTACT_373291] -filled adipocytes. 
These intradermal adipocytes regenerate with faster kinetics than other adipose tissue depots and 
such growth parallels with the hair cycle, suggesting an interplay exists between hair follicle 
cells and adipocyctes
12. Thus, it has been established that adipose is an integral part of the 
normal hair cycle and it is hypothesized that telogen may be due to an absence of adipose tissue 
as it is reported that hair loss and decreased adipocytes occur together12,13. Therefore, the 
transplantation of adipose tissue, or autologous fat transfer (AFT), into the subcutaneous layer of 
fat in the scalp for purposes of stimulating hair growth is consistent with t he reported literature 
that indicates hair loss and adipose loss occur in tandem. 

STYLE; Version A 
[ADDRESS_467186] 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 54   Autologous Fat Transfer  
 
In an AFT procedure, a patient’s subcutaneous adipose tissue is aspi[INVESTIGATOR_373257] (most 
commonly the abdomen or thighs) and t ransferred into another depot of subcutaneous fat located 
throughout the body (e.g., mid -face). This procedure is reported to be practiced by [CONTACT_373292] 
[ADDRESS_467187] adding 
extra tissue in an effort to  compensate for inevitable tissue loss that has been estimated at 
between 20 -80% of the implanted tissue16-18. As a result of this unpredictability defect repair 
frequently requires multiple repeated or staged procedures per formed at intervals of three or 
more months. For example, one large study reports up to five treatments needed (mean = three 
treatments) in order to achieve success in restoring volume19. This leads to delays in achievement 
of effective treatment of the defect, expense, and the higher morbidity of repeated tissue 
collection and  implantation.  
 
A number of investigators have evaluated ways by [CONTACT_373293], thereby, limit the number of 
procedures needed to achieve successful treatment. For example, animal studies have shown that 
use of agents that stimulate the healing process (for example, gene therapy with factors that 
stimulate  new blood vessel growth20) can increase the survival of transferred tissue and that, 
conversely, agents that inhibit healing reduce surviva l21. Recent preclinical and clinical data have 
shown in addition to being a source of tissue for soft tissue filling, human adipose tissue contains cells that have the ability to promote healing
22,23. Zhu et al have used an animal model to show 
that coating one volume of  adipose tissue with cells isolated from another volume of adipose 
tissue results in an approximate doubling of graft retention at six and nine months24. This finding 
has been confirmed by [CONTACT_373294]25. The concept of this approach is that signals 
generated at the interface between implanted fat and adjacent breast fat will induce improved 
healing. Increasing the number of cells capable of generating these signals at this interface will 
lead to successful tissue retention. 
 
In addition, Puregraft processed adipose has an excellent safety profile in aesthetic body 
contouring26. 
Currently, there are few, if any, minimally invasive, autologous cell therapeu tic modalities being

Celution System (Cytori Therapeutics, San Diego, [LOCATION_003]). Celution processed ADRCs have an 
excellent safety profile in a variety of cond itions including acute myocardial injury, patients with 
chronic heart muscle damage, breast insufficiency following lumpectomy (a cell -enriched AFT 
procedure), chronic cutaneous wounds, and urinary incontinence, and most recently in a small 
study of sclero derma patients27-32. 
In addition, Puregraft processed adipose has an excellent safety profile in aesthetic body 
contouring26. 
Cytori’s initial clinical experience in treating pathological cond itions was in the myocardium, 
The PRECISE Clinical Trial evaluated the safety and feasibility of intramyocardial 
administration of ADRCs in patients with chronic myocardial ischemia not amenable to 
revascularization.[ADDRESS_467189] demonstrated safety and signs of 
feasibility. PRECISE was a prospective, double -blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-  
controlled, sequential dose escalation study which enrolled 27 subjects. Following baseline 
electromechanical mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], subjects received ≤ 15 intramyocardial injections of ADRCs (n=21; 
median dose of ADRCs [ADDRESS_467190]) or placebo (n=6: indistinguishable solution) in the 
area(s) of the heart with inducible ischemia. ADRCs were processed using the C ytori Celution 
System. ADRC -treated subjects demonstrated improvement in maximum oxygen consumption 
(VO 2max) relative to a placebo control. Adverse events and serious adverse events were equally 
distributed across all treatments groups with angina reported as the most frequent  SAE.  
 
The APOLLO Clinical Trial was a safety and feasibility study of ADRCs processed by [CONTACT_373295] -

In Stough’s report, the authors indicate that while the condition may not appear to cause direct 
physical harm in men, hair loss can protect against sunburn, cold temperatures, mechanical 
injury, and ultraviolet light3. Beyond the physical, hair loss is known to psychologically affect 
the balding individual’s perceptions of themselves. This is particularly true when looking at 
FPHL, where Cash  and co -workers reported that while AA was a stressful experience for both 
sexes, it was substantially more distressing for women7. In sum, the impact of the condition 
should not be relegated as simply aesthetic in nature, and therefore satisfactory treatment 
regimens are necessary.  
 
 
4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
The STYLE Trial is a prospective, randomized, multi -center device trial intended to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of the Celution and Puregraft Systems in the processing and preparation of an 
autologous fat graft enriched with adipose -derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) in the treatment 
of early alopecia androgenetica. Patients may be i ncluded if they are undergoing an elective 
cosmetic liposuction. Following informed consent and screening evaluations, eligible subjects will undergo pre -operative testing. Subjects will then undergo a fat harvest using local anesthesia 
with or without conscious sedating. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a fat graft cell enriched with ADRCs (available in two different doses), a fat graft without cell enrichment using a visually -matched blood saline solution (fat alone control), or a saline inje ction (no- fat control) 
in a 2:2:2:1 ratio.  
 
While undergoing liposuction, lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_373258]. After the liposuction is completed), patients will have, under a ring block local anesthesia (see 
further description below), a subcutaneous scalp injection of either Puregraft purified autologous fat or saline (no -fat control) followed by a separate second injection, of either AD RCs (available 
in two different doses), a visually -matched blood saline solution (fat alone control), or saline (no-  
fat control) in a 2:2:2:1 ratio.  
 
 
All subjects will undergo clinical evaluations and laboratory testing prior to and after the 
procedure a s outlined in Section 9.0, Study Assessments, and in the Schedule of Procedures 
(Appendix A).

5.[ADDRESS_467199] Identification 
 
All subjects will undergo liposuction and will be randomized into one of four parallel arms in a 
2:2:2:1 ratio to receive either low dose ADRCs cell enriched fat (n=20), high dose ADRC cell 
enriched fat (n=20), non- cell enriched autologous fat alone control (n=20), or no- fat control 
saline inject ions (n=10). Randomization will be via an interactive voice/web response system 
(IVRS/IWRS), or an alternatively acceptable system, and occur on the procedure day, prior to the start of  liposuction. 
 
Patients randomized into the study will be assigned the treatment corresponding to the next 
available number in the computer -generated randomization schedule. The dose of the test 
material (ADRCs or placebo) is discussed in S ection 6.3. 
 
Randomization and dose preparation will be performed by [CONTACT_21703], or other designated qualified personnel, as outlined in the Study Reference Manual. The unblinded 
pharmacist or designee will not be involved in study patient care, management or follow up procedures and assessments.

5.3 Blinding Procedures and  Safeguards  
 
The following will be the “blinded parties”, meaning that the listed will have no knowledge of 
the patient’s treatment  assignment: 
• Patients  
• Core  Laboratories  
• Data Management  personnel  
• Sponsor  
• Study  Monitors  
The “unblinded parties ”, meaning those that will or may have knowledge of a patient’s 
treatment assignment, will be the  following: - 
• Investigators  
• Unblinded Pharmacist or designee involved in the dose preparation procedures and 
randomization of the  patient  
• Data Monitoring Committee  Members  
• Unblinded Statistician  
The study blind should not be broken except in a medical emergency (where knowledge of the 
test material received would af fect the treatment of the emergency) or regulatory requirement 
(e.g., for SAEs or death).  
If unblinding becomes necessary, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor or the Medical Monitor as soon as possible. If the blind is broken, the date, time and reason must be recorded in 
the Subject’s electronic case report form (eCRF), together with a note of a protocol violation if applicable, and any applicable reports [e.g. Adverse Event (AE)].

[ADDRESS_467202] 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 54   6 CELUTION & PUREGRAFT  SYSTEMS  
 
6.1 Celution& Puregraft System  Descriptions  
 
The Celution System consists of a stand -alone re -useable hardware unit called the Celution 
Device, the Celution Consumable Set, and Celase®. The Celution System prepares an ADRC 
output from adipose tissue c ollected by [CONTACT_373297].  
 
Following the collection of tissue, the adipose tissue is introduced into the device’s collection 
canister in order to wash the adipose tissue and remove deleterious substances (such as cellular debris)(Detaile d instructions for use are found in the Celution User Manual, the Celution 
Consumable IFU and the Celase IFU ). 
 
The Puregraft [ADDRESS_467203] to an off -the-shelf sterile luer lock syringe and its attached slider is used to facilitate the 
movement  of liquids through the filter mesh and out of the Puregraft bag through the drain stub 
as waste. Detailed instructions for use are found in the Puregraft IFU).  
 
6.2 Device Characterization and Intended  Use 
 
In combination with the Puregraft 50 System, the Cel ution System (Celution Device, Celution 
Consumables Set, and Celase reagent) is intended to digest adipose tissue in order to further extract, wash and concentrate adipose derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) intended for combination with autologous fat and reimplantation subcutaneously into the scalp for investigational use in the STYLE clinical trial.  
 
The Puregraft 50 System is intended to process and purify adipose tissue to be combined with concentrated stromal stem cells and other associated progenitor cells intended for autologous implantation subcutaneously into the scalp for investigational use in the STYLE clinical trial.  
 
6.3 Contraindications  
 
1. Non-autologous use is  contraindicated  
2. Use of any tissues other than adipose is  contraindicated  
 
6.4 Intended Clinical  Performance  
 
The Celution System is designed to process lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_373260]. When ADRCs are prepared using the Celution System, the resultant cell suspension contains all of the components naturally occurring in the native tissue. Preparation of autologous ADRCs for subcutaneous delivery using the Celution System involves no cell culture and can be prepared and re -implanted 
into the same patient within three hours from completion of lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. 
STYLE; Version A 
[ADDRESS_467204] 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 54   The total viable cell count and percentage viability for each sample will be used as the 
acceptance criteria. This will be assessed for each patient to decide whether the cell output is 
acceptable, and to prepare the prescribed dose. The viable cell count will be performed by [CONTACT_373298]® Automated Cell Counting System. Using a small sample 
of the Celution System output, the NucleoCounter Automated Cell Counting System provides a 
count of both live and dead nucleated cells in the total sample. All personnel involved will be 
trained according to standardiz ed procedures and work instructions. Cytori has performed 
characterizations of the live cell output obtained by [CONTACT_373299] 70% viability or greater. This sample count is used to calculate the total number of live nucleated 
cells from the total preparation, to arrive at percentage of viable cells that are available for 
introduction into the  patient.  
 
The Puregraft System is designed to prepare purified lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. This purification involves the 
near complete removal of fre e lipid, RBCs, and WBCs. All personnel involved will be trained 
according to standardized procedures and work instructions. 
 
6.5 Celution& Puregraft System Output; Physical, Chemical, and  Pharmaceutical 
Properties of ADRCs  
 
The output of the Celution System is  an ADRC output obtained from autologous lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_373261]. The suspension of viable ADRCs has been characterized with an average viability of  
>70% and the average yield is 3.24 x 105 ± 1.48 of mononuclear cells per gram of adipose tissue 
entered into the Celution System. An index of regenerative cell potential, the CFU -F assay, 
shows that 1.51% of those ADRCs form colonies (mean range of 0.13 to 4.08% colony forming units). 
 
The product is a suspension of cells in a diluent. The cellular component s of the suspension are 
made up of nucleated and non- nucleated cells. The non- nucleated cells are red blood cells (RBC) 
that comprise > 95% of the total cell suspension. The nucleated cells make up approximately 0.1  
– 5% of the total cell suspension. Nucle ated cells are present in the following approximate 
minimum percentages: CD 31+, CD 34+ (> 2%); CD 34+, CD 31-, CD  45-  (>  10%); CD  45+, 
CD 31 -, CD 34-  (> 15%). The combination of these three phenotypes will account for greater 
than 90% of nucleated cel ls in the product. Table 1 summarizes the ADRC cellular suspension 
processed by [CONTACT_373300].

[ADDRESS_467205] 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 54   Puregraft 50 System  
 
The Puregraft 50 System is used in conjunction with a lipoplasty device (user supplied) and does 
not contact [CONTACT_373301]. The Puregraft 50 System is only used on 
the back table in the operating room to rinse and filter an adipose tissue graft and prepare the graft for eventual injection back into the same patient during the same surgical procedure. The Puregraft 50 System is a bag with two tubing stubs/ports (tissue and drain) and is designed to harvest, rinse and filter the adi pose tissue, and subsequently drain excess rinse solution away 
from the adipose tissue. The rinsed and filtered adipose tissue is then removed from the Puregraft bag using syringes (user supplied) and ultimately transplanted back into the same patient. The  
Puregraft 50 System includes a slider tool that is attached to the exterior of the Puregraft bag. The slider is used to compress the Puregraft bag as a means to facilitate the movement of liquids through the filter mesh and out of the Puregraft bag through the drain stub/port as  waste.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_467206] been shown to facilitate vascularization, and as well as those associated with anti -inflammatory effects, thereby, 
ameliorating injury  by [CONTACT_303886]. Viability characterization of ADRCs as 
described above in addition to pre -clinical animal data from Cytori and other published reports 
support this hypothesis. 
 
 
7 STUDY TREATMENTS  
 
Subjects will be randomized 2:2:2:1 to active  treatment (autologous fat enriched with ADRCs), 
autologous fat alone control, or no- fat control as follows:  
Active (0.5 x 106 ADRCs/cm2 scalp):  20 Subjects  
Active (1.0 x 106 ADRCs/cm2 scalp):  20 Subjects 
Autologous fat alone  control:  20 Subjects  
No-fat control (saline)  10 Subjects  
 
The study treatment will be administered as subcutaneous injections of either fat or saline into 
the subcutaneous fat layer of the scalp (40cm2 of scalp) of each subject. Each square centimeter 
of scalp will be injected with 0.1 mL of purified autologous fat or saline followed by [CONTACT_373302]
2 scalp, or saline (fat alone control 
and the no -fat control). To account for the variability seen in advanced grades of hair loss 
(Norwood Grade II and IV), treatment areas will be focused in the mid- scalp and crown  (vertex).  
STYLE; Version A 
[ADDRESS_467207] Description – Cell -enriched autologous  fat 
 
The active treatment used for the STYLE Trial will be cell -enriched autologous fat obtained 
from the study subject’s own adipose tissue which is prepared using the Puregraft and Celution 
Systems.  
 
The excipi[INVESTIGATOR_373262]. Specifically, the residual reagents are collagenase (<0.005 Wünch Units/mL) and thermolysin neutral protease (< 30 caseinase Units/mL). The diluentis Lactated Ringers solution (USP).  
 
Adipose tissue processing is detailed in both the Puregraft and Celution System Users Manuals . 
Preparation of the active study treatment is provided in the Study Reference Manual . 
 
7.1.1 Active Treatment Dose Control  
 
Autologous adipose purified with the Puregraft System can be readily removed directly with a sterile 1mL syringe to obtain a volume of 0.1mL for injection. 
 
ADRC Cell count and viability will be controlled using the NucleoCounterAutomated Cell Counting System (Enfield, CT) at each site using the following acceptance criteria:  
 
• Nominal cell count: 40 x 106 ADRCs  
• A minimum cell count within  50% of the nominal cell count is required (i.e., a dose as 
low as 20 x 106 ADRCs is acceptable if 40 x 106 ADRCs is not be  available)  
• Cell viability: ≥ 70%  
If cell viability is <70%, as determined by [CONTACT_373303], the s ubject will not be treated.  
• Negative result in Gram stain testing (see Section  7.3) 
7.[ADDRESS_467208] Description – Control  Doses  
 
The fat alone control dose will be purified autologous tissue prepared by [CONTACT_373304] n ot enriched with ADRCs but with saline. The amount of fat injected will be 0.1 mL/cm2 
of scalp. The fat alone control dose will also include injection of a saline solution which is mixed 
with 0.1mL to 0.[ADDRESS_467209]’s own freshly drawn blood to achieve a dilution that 
is visually indistinguishable from ADRCs. The saline injection of the fat -alone control must test 
negative in a Gram stain test of sterility prior to being administered (see Section 7.3) . Prep aration 
of the fat -alone control dose is provided in the Study Reference  Manual . 
STYLE; Version A 
[ADDRESS_467210] 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 54   The no- fat control dose will be 0.1ml/cm2 of scalp of saline injected (delivered by a blunt tip 
cannula) followed by a second matching dose of saline solution (via a 25G needle) to 0.1ml/cm2 
of scalp.  
 
7.2.1 Justification of Control Dose  
 
To reduce the risk of bias (selection bias, performance bias, detection bias and attrition bias), all 
patients will undergo pre -specified screening procedures, fat harvest, and injection of active 
treatment or placebo. The justification and rationale of the placebo dose arm include:  
 
1. In the presence of a concurrent placebo control group, demographics and patient selection is more likely to be balanced allowing for more reliab le interpretation of study  results.  
 
2. Minimize the potential of the Hawthorne effect creating a positive impression of efficacy that may overstate the actual treatment  effect.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_467211] result is required prior to injection of ADRCs and/or fat alone control. A negative Gram stain test result is not required prior to injection of saline in the no- fat control 
arm. If the sample is determined to be positive for bacteria then the cellular administration procedure must be stopped and the subject should not receive any study treatment. 
 
Furth er testing (BacT Alert Culture and Sensitivity) will be performed in order to test for the 
presence of any low level microbial contamination that might not be apparent in the gram stain test. Should a culture be deemed positive for microbial activity, the investigator will be immediately notified. The study patient will be evaluated and a course of treatment and/or antibiotics may be administered, as determined by [CONTACT_1704]. The source of the contamination will be evaluated as appropriate. The FDA and IRB will be notified within [ADDRESS_467212]  results.

7.3.1 ADRC Characterization  
 
In order to characterize the phenotype of ADRCs obtained from patients with alopecia 
androgenetica, adipose tissue will be obtained during the elective cosmetic liposuction.; up to 360 mL of this tissue (maximum that can be processed by [CONTACT_373305]) will be used to prepare the active study treatment  (ADRCs) using the Celution System. Once it is determined 
that the cell dose has been achieved according to criteria described in Section 7.1.1, any 
remaining adipose tissue may be shipped to an outsourced facility of the Sponsor (if within two hours of the outsourced laboratory) according to procedures outlined in the Study Reference Manual . 
 
In the Sponsor’s outsourced contract laboratory, ADRCs will be prepared from collected adipose tissue using the same Celution System as used in the clinic and the cell output characterized using colony forming unit – fibroblast (CFU -F), a measure of the number of adipose stem cells, 
and multiparametric flow cytometry analyses used to define the major non -progenitor cell 
populations in ADRCs. In the flow analyses ADRCs will be stained using antibodies directed to CD31, CD34, CD136 and CD45 proteins. Based on the expression of these four markers, the major populations will be defined as follow:  
 
Leukocytes  CD45+  
Endothelial  Cells  CD34+/CD31+/CD45 - 
Stromal Cells  CD34+/CD31- /CD45 - 
Mural  cells CD34 -/CD31 -/CD45 -/CD146+  
 
If sufficient cells are available, additional characterization of subpopulations will be performed using antibodies such as CD3, CD14, CD19, and CD16/ 56.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Fat Harvest  Procedure 
 
Fat harvest from small volume liposuction is a standard procedure practiced by [CONTACT_373307] a variety of settings and using a variety of techniques. However, a specific set  of 
guidelines have been established for the collection of fat that can then be used for the optimized preparation of ADRCs. These guidelines, which are recommendations and not requirements, include the  following; 
 
· Syringe -based fat harvest is preferred.  
· Use up to [ADDRESS_467224]  tip 
· 60 mL Toomey syringes are used for tissue  acquisition  
· Use  14 gauge, up to 30 cm, blunt LAMIS infiltrator for tumescent fluid 
administration  
· Symmetric fat removal is required keepi[INVESTIGATOR_373264]  
· The abdominal region is the preferred site for fat  harvest  
 
1. Local anesthesia with or without conscious sedation; general anesthesia is not permitted 
for fat  harvest  
2. Using sterile techniqu e, prepare up to 3 sites, including the preferred abdomen and 
flanks along with the inner and the outer thighs and the posterior and anterior  thighs.  
3. Make an approximately 0.5 cm stab skin incision  
4. Infiltrate tumescent solution using a blunt LAMIS infiltrator and a volume ratio of 1:1 
of tumescent solution to fat to be  harvested  
 
Tumescent fluid formula:  
· 500 mL of Lactated Ringers  solution 
· 20 mL of 1%  Lidocaine  
· 1 mg of  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]  
 
5. To sufficiently induce vasoconstriction/hemostasis during the liposuction procedure a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_467225] be  used.  
6. After approximately 10 minutes , the adipose tissue is harvested through the same incision, 
using the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_373265]  
7. After the syringe is filled (complete filling is not required), cap syringe and replace with 
empty  one 
8. Continue fat harvest until desired volume is safely achieved, with the target volume of 
adipose tissue harvested limited to approximately [ADDRESS_467226]

liposuction procedure should be terminated if any of the foll owing occur:  
 
1. Drop in systolic blood pressure < 90mm/Hg that is unresponsive to volume or 
pressor  support  
2. Profuse or uncontrollable bleeding from the puncture  site(s)  
3. Rapid expansion of subcutaneous space at the liposuction site(s) related to bleeding 
into the subcutaneous  space  
4. Hemoperitoneum or  pnuemopertinoeum  
5. Hemothorax or  pneumothorax  
6. Evidence of perforation of a vascular structure that requires ligature or surgical 
control  
7. Evidence of perforation into abdominal cavity, peritoneum or gastrointestinal organ  
 
Should any of the above occur, the fat harvest procedure should be terminated and the patient treated according to standard of care. DO NOT PROCEED WITH INJECTION. Complete the study specific SAE form and notify the sponsor within [ADDRESS_467229] and cell injection procedures. 
 
9.3.3 Fat + ADRC Injection  
 
The following procedure is recommended for subcutaneous injection into the scalp for the 
treatment of baldness due to alopecia androgenetica:  
 
Autologous Fat & Saline Injection 
This fat or saline injection procedure will occur after the completion of the liposuction. Aseptic technique should be maintained throughout the procedure . A treatment grid will be prepared in 
the area to be treated. The grid is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_373267] a surgical skin marker is used to mark each of the holes which are spaced every cen timeter. The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_373268] a local ring block with 1% 
lidocaine with 1:100,[ADDRESS_467230] should be given. The maximum dose delivered should not exceed 7mg/kg. Sedation may be employed to minimize patient discomfort at the discretion of th e investigator. Tissue from the 
Puregraft 50 is prepared in separate, sterile 1mL luer lock syringes, and an 11- blade scalpel can 
be used to make a stab incision (incision is made at a strategic insertion point to facilitate access to the area to be treated) to allow insertion of a 0.9mm -1.2mm diameter blunt -tip cannula. This

[ADDRESS_467231] and the tip is fanned into each 
1 square centimeter grid to deliver 0.1mL of tissue or saline (no- fat control). 
 
ADRC & Saline Injection  
After preparation of the ADRCs, either the low or high dose of ADRC or saline will be injected using a 25G needle directly through the skin into the layer of subcutaneous adipose using the identical grid markings made in the paragraph described above. Additional local anesthesia ± sedation may be applied as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093].

10.1 Risks  
 
The use of adult regenerative cells from adipose tissue and other sources has shown 
improvement in muscular (cardiac) function after injection into ischemic areas of the heart. The PRECISE Clinical Trial has shown an acceptable safety profile and signs of benefits following intramyocardial administration of ADRCs processed by [CONTACT_373311]. Every potential complication of ADRC injections are unknown at this time; however injection of cells from adipose tissue have been delivered with guided intramyoca rdial injections with no clinical 
significant sequelae. A clinical trial of 12 patients with hand dysfunction and pain from scleroderma followed for 6 months showed minor adverse events related to subcutaneous injection, typi[INVESTIGATOR_373269], and no adverse events directly related to  ADRCs.

11 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
 
This is a multi- centre, single- blinded, randomized, parallel group, controlled study to evaluate 
the preliminary safety of cell -enriched autologous fat compared to placebo in patients with 
baldness due to alopecia androgenetica. The primary endpoint will be the safety and tolerability 
of the  procedure.  
 
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with the baseline measure used as a covariate, will be used for the analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints. Comparisons of each active arm with placebo will be made using Dunnett comparisons. The ITT popul ation will be used for the 
primary analysis; the analysis will also be performed in the PTE population and will be considered as supportive of the ITT analysis.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_467245] data review meeting of the DMC is held, a separate 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be completed, providing detailed methods for the analyses outlined in the following subsect ions. The SAP will detail all planned analyses and will serve as 
a statistical programming requirements  document.  
 
11.2 Determination of Sample Size  
 
The sample size for the trial has been set at 70, based on clinical considerations and is not based on formal power calculations.  
 
The objective of the STYLE Trial is to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of cell -enriched 
autologous adipose delivered via a subcutaneous route in the treatment of baldness due to alopecia androgenetica. As the primary endpoint  is safety and tolerability, the investigators 
believe that a sample of 20 subjects per arm and a 10 patient no- fat saline control is adequate.  
 
11.3 Data  Analyses  
 
Safety and efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_2070] (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum), for quantitative variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Laboratory data will also be summarized using shift tables  
STYLE; Version A 
[ADDRESS_467246] -baseline visit time 
point. Additionall y variables will be analyzed using ANCOVA models with adjustment for the 
baseline value of the variable.  
 
Related adverse events will be analyzed separately for those related to ADRCs and the delivery of ADRCs (i.e., injection site such as shock loss). A s eparate safety analysis will be performed 
for Adverse Events of Interest ( Appendix B, Adverse Event Terminology and Grading ). 
 
11.3.1  Primary Endpoint  Analysis  
 
The primary endpoint for the study is safety and tolerability through 24 weeks 
The hypotheses are:  
Adverse event rates through 24 weeks for active treatment will be less than or equal to 
adverse events rates published for autologous fat grafting.  
 
Vital sign abnormalities through 24 weeks for active treatment will be less than or equal to those published for autologous fat grafting.  
 
Physical exam abnormalities through 24 weeks for active treatment will be less than or equal to those published for autologous fat grafting.  
 
The corresponding nul l hypotheses are that the adverse event rates will be greater for active 
treatment arms than for placebo.  
 
Statistical testing will not be performed for these hypotheses, but the safety endpoints will be evaluated clinically.  
 
11.3.2  Secondary and Exploratory Endpoint  Analysis  
 
The secondary endpoints are change from baseline in the (a) Average Trichogram growth rates at

Safety:  All treated subjects; subjects will be analyzed as  treated.  
 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) : All randomized subjects; randomization will occur on procedure day prior 
to liposuction. Subjects will be included in the analysis as randomized 
 
Per-Treatment -Evaluable (PTE) : All randomized subjects who have received treatment and 
follow -up information is available. Protocol violators, where the violation is judged to affect the 
interpretation of the treatment effect will be excluded. All exclusions will be made prior to the breaking of the treatment blind. 
 
11.6 Handling of Missing Data 
Safety data will not be imputed. 
PTE data will not be  imputed.  
Missing efficacy data will be imputed for the ITT analysis population. For missing data caused 
by [CONTACT_373315] (either han d or systemic manifestation), the missing value will be 
replaced by [CONTACT_373316]. For other missing data, last observation carried forward will be the primary method of imputation. As a sensitivit y analysis, multiple impute ion methods (SAS PROC MI and PROC MIANALIZE) will 
be used. 
 
For the analysis of quality of life, missing responses to individual questionnaire items will be imputed using the methods prescribed by [CONTACT_373317].  
 
11.7 Prot ocol Deviations  
 
Deviations from the protocol including violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed as “minor” or “major” in cooperation with the Sponsor. Deviations will be defined prior to un-  
blinding. Major deviations may result in remo val from the PTE analysis population. 
 
11.8 Data Monitoring Committee

12 ADVERSE EVENTS / SERIOUS ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
12.1 Definitions  
 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a Subject during 
the course of the study, whether or not it is related to the test material or the study procedure. 
Expected adverse events are those t hat are listed as known risks of the liposuction or injection 
procedure including those described in this protocol, informed consent, and/or the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in  death,  
• Is life-threatening,  
• Requires or prolongs Subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacity  
• Is an important medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_373273]  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious and 
whether expedited reporting is appropriate.

severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application or any other 
unanticipated serious problem with the Celution or Puregraft system devi ces that relates to the 
rights, safety or welfare of subjects.  
 
12.2 Procedures for AE  Reporting  
 
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_373318] (eCRF). Events that occur prior to the liposuction- related activities, including those that are 
considered serious, are to be recorded in the medical history. Events, including SAEs, which occur after liposuction- related activities are initiated on procedure day, are to be recorded on the 
AE eCRF. The investigator  will evaluate the relationship of the adverse event to both the test 
material and study procedure as unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, or definitely related and will record the findings, including all pertinent details of the event on the eCRF. 
 
In addition, the Investigator or designee will report any serious adverse events, including UADE, 
occurring during this study to the Sponsor and Medical Monitor as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_467252]’s well -being and document 
these measures on the appropriate eCRF.  
 
All serious adverse events experienced will be monitored until the event has resolved, any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or stabilized at a level acceptable to the 
Investigator and Medical Monitor, or until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_467253] are described in Appendix B, Adverse Event Terminology and Grading (from National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events).

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Cytori Celution 
and Puregraft Systems in the processing and preparation of an autologous fat graft enriched with adipose -derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) in the treatment of early alopecia androgenetica.  
 
 
2 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Alopecia  Androgenetica  
 
Alopecia Androgenetica (AGA) is the most common form of both male pattern hair loss (MPHL) 
and female pattern hair loss (FPHL )1,2 with the condition affec ting approximately 50% of the 
male population and less than 45% of women going through life with a full head of hair. The 
degree of hair loss in the male patient is generally classified using the Norwood Hamilton 
Classification (Figure 1)  and FPHL is evaluated based on the Savin scale (Figure 2)1,3. The 
incidence and prevalence of the condition are generally well documented in both genders. Stough 
and co -workers reported that in White males, 30% have AGA by [CONTACT_654] 30 and 50% by [CONTACT_654] 50 with 
lower incidences seen in African American, Chinese, and Japanese populations3. In a population 
based report looking at MPHL, the authors reported that in the 30- 35 years age group, grade I 
hair loss was 51%, while grade II was 43% and grade VI was only approximately 19% --clearly 
highlighting early hair loss in the younger population4. Of the 1,005 men in the study aging from 
30-50 years, 44% were found to have grades I -III hair loss. 
 
In women, diffuse thinning and loss of hair density with maintenance of the frontal hairline describe the typi[INVESTIGATOR_373256]5. In one report, the prevalence of early, clinically detectable 
FPHL was 12% of females bet ween 20 -29 years of age and 25% by 49 years of age
2. In the table 
presented below (Table 1) , Gan and Sinclair documented the distribution of hair loss in 752 
women using a modified 5- point gra ding scale6. Below the age of 40 years, 99% of women 
reporting loss documented early stage loss.  
 
 
In sum, a significant percentage of both male and female population suffer from AG at a 
relatively early age.  

STYLE; Version B 
24 November 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 53   Figure 1 —MPHL Norwood Hamilton Classification  
 
 
 
Class I represents an adolescent or juvenile hairline and it not actually balding.  The adolescent 
hairline generally rests on the upper brow crease.  
 
Class II indicates a progression to the adult or mature hairline which sits a finger breath (1.5cm) 
above the upper brow crease, with some temporal recession. This also does not represent balding.  
 
Class III is the earliest stage of male hair loss. It is characterized by a deepening temporal recession.  
 
Class III Vertex represents early hair loss in the crown (vertex).  
 
Class IV Is characterized by [CONTACT_373288], but there is still a solid band of hair across top separating front and vertex.  
 
Class V the bald areas in the front and crown continue to enlarge and the bridge of hair separating the two areas begins to break down.  
 
Class VI occurs when the connecting bridge of hair disappears leaving a single large bald area on the front and top of the scalp. The hair on the sides of the scalp remains relatively high.  

STYLE; Version B 
24 November 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 53   Figure 2 —FPHL Ludwig Scale  
 
The current treatment regimen for alopecia andro genetica is a spectrum ranging from non - 
invasive medicinal approaches to robot -assisted surgical transplantation of thousands of 
follicular units. On the non- invasive side, the two medicines currently approved for treatment of 
genetic pattern alopecia by [CONTACT_373289] (for men only) and minoxidil8,9. Both of these 
medicines carry untoward side -effects. For finasteride, sexual dysfunction, particularly for the 
younger patient who is most likely to present with early  hair loss, was seen in between 2.1% and 
3.8% of men10. Initial treatment of early alopecia is typi[INVESTIGATOR_257316] -invasive and the two 
medications approved by [CONTACT_373290]. For minoxidil, it is 
reported that approximately one- third of patients with AA respond with new hair growt h11. In 
contrast, invasive transplant options are generally not offered to patients with early AA and if so, 
require significant financial reso urces. As a result, there remains a significantly large gap 
between these medicinal and transplant options. Hence a distinct medical need remains specific 
to addressing early  alopecia.  
During hair follicle growth (anagen), the hair follicle delves deep int o the rich dermal 
macroenvironment as it grows to maturity where it is surrounded by [CONTACT_373323]- filled adipocytes. 
These intradermal adipocytes regenerate with faster kinetics than other adipose tissue depots and 
such growth parallels with the hair cycle,  suggesting an interplay exists between hair follicle 
cells and adipocyctes12. Thus, it has been established that adipose is an integral part of the 
normal hair cycle and it is hypothesized that telogen may be due to an absence of adipose tissue 
as it is reported that hair loss and decreased adipocytes occur together12,13. Therefore, the 
transplantation of adipose tissue, or autologous fat transfer (AFT), into the subcutaneous layer of 
fat in the scalp for purposes of stimulating hair growth is consistent with the reported literature 
that indicates hair loss and adipose loss occur in tandem. 

STYLE; Version B 
24 November 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 53   Autologous Fat Transfer  
 
In an AFT procedure, a patient’s subcutaneous adipose tissue i s aspi[INVESTIGATOR_373257] (most 
commonly the abdomen or thighs) and transferred into another depot of subcutaneous fat located 
throughout the body (e.g., mid -face). This procedure is reported to be practiced by [CONTACT_373292] 
[ADDRESS_467284] adding 
extra tissue in an effort to compensate for inevitable tissue loss that has been estimated at 
between 20 -80% of the implanted tissue16-18. As a result of this unpredictability defect repair 
frequently requires m ultiple repeated or staged procedures performed at intervals of three or 
more months. For example, one large study reports up to five treatments needed (mean = three treatments) in order to achieve success in restoring volume
19. This leads to delays in achievement 
of effective treatment of the defect, expense, and the higher morbidity of repeated tissue 
collection and  implantation.  
 
A number of investigators have evaluated ways by [CONTACT_373293], thereby, limit the number of 
procedures needed to achieve successful treatment. For example, animal studies have shown that 
use of agents that stimulate the healing process (for example,  gene therapy with factors that 
stimulate new blood vessel growth20) can increase the survival of transferred tissue and that, 
conversely, agents that inhibit healing reduce surviva l21. Recent  preclinical and clinical data have 
shown in addition to being a source of tissue for soft tissue filling, human adipose tissue contains 
cells that have the ability to promote healing22,23. Zhu et al have used an animal model to show 
that coating one volume of adipose tissue with cells isolated from another volume of adipose 
tissue results in an approximate doubling of graft retention at six and nine months24. This finding 
has been confirmed by [CONTACT_373294]25. The concept of this approach is that signals 
generated at the interface between implanted fat and adjacent breast fat will induce improved 
healing. Increasing the number of cells capable o f generating these signals at this interface will 
lead to successful tissue retention. 
 
In addition, Puregraft processed adipose has an excellent safety profile in aesthetic body 
contouring26. 
Currently, there are few, if an y, minimally invasive, autologous cell therapeutic modalities being 
developed that address early alopecia. However, analyses from other therapeutic applications of

[ADDRESS_467285] been treated with autologous ADRCs isolated using the 
Celution System (Cytori Therapeutics, San Diego, [LOCATION_003]). Celution processed ADRCs have a n 
excellent safety profile in a variety of conditions including acute myocardial injury, patients with chronic heart muscle damage, breast insufficiency following lumpectomy (a cell -enriched AFT 
procedure), chronic cutaneous wounds, and urinary incontinenc e, and most recently in a small 
study of scleroderma patient s
27-32. 
In addition, Puregraft processed adipose has an excellent safety profile in aesthetic body 
contouring26. 
Cytori’s initial clinical experience in treating pathological conditions was in the myocardium, 
The PRECISE Clinical Trial evaluated the safety and feasibility of intramyocardial administration of ADRCs in patients with chronic myocardial ischemia not amenable to 
revasculari zation.
[ADDRESS_467286] demonstrated safety and signs of 
feasibility. PRECISE was a prospective, double -blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-  
controlled, sequential dose escalation study which enrolled 27 subjects. Following baseline 
electromechanical mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], subjects received ≤ 15 intramyocardial injections of ADRCs (n=21; 
median dose of ADRCs [ADDRESS_467287]) or placebo (n=6: indistinguishable solution) in the 
area(s) of the heart with induc ible ischemia. ADRCs were processed using the Cytori Celution 
System. ADRC -treated subjects demonstrated improvement in maximum oxygen consumption 
(VO 2max) relative to a placebo control. Adverse events and serious adverse events were equally 
distributed ac ross all treatments groups with angina reported as the most frequent  SAE.  
 
The APOLLO Clinical Trial was a safety and feasibility study of ADRCs processed by [CONTACT_373295] - 
segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).28 This was a prospective , double -blind, 3:1 
randomized (ADRC: Placebo), parallel group, placebo- controlled trial. A total of [ADDRESS_467288] described benefits in the treatment of radiation inj ury, fistulas and stress urinary 
incontinence. Yoshimoto et al. described efficacy of ADRC treatment in three patients presenting 
with chronic radiation injuries with ulcers and severe fibrosis .29 They reported increases in local 
blood circulation at the site by [CONTACT_373296]. Gotoh et al recently 
described improvements in urinary incontinence following ADRC injections in a case series of 
11 men who underwent radical prostatectomy.30 Of note, enhanced ultrasonography showed a 
progressive increase in blood flow to the injected area in all patients. Borowski reported

examining the effects of subcutaneous administration of ADRCs to all fingers has recently been 
published.32 Data at six months indicated significant improvements in Cochin score, Raynaud’s 
severity score, and in the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ). The procedure 
was tolerated well without complications.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_467289] been documented. 
In Stough’s report, the authors indicate that while the condition may not appear to cause direct 
physical harm in men, hair loss can protect against sunburn, cold temperatures, mechanical 
injury, and ultraviolet light3. Beyond the physical, hair loss is known to psychologically affect 
the balding individual’s perceptions of themselves. This is particularly true when looking at 
FPHL, where Cash  and co -workers reported that while AA was a stressful experience for both 
sexes, it was substantially more distressing for women7. In sum, the impact of the condition 
should not be relegated as simply aesthetic in nature, and therefore satisfactory treatment 
regimens are necessary.  
 
 
4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
The STYLE Trial is a prospective, randomized, multi -center device trial intended to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of the Celution and Puregraft Systems in the processing and preparation of an 
autologous fat graft enriched with adipose -derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) in the treatment 
of early alopecia androgenetica. Patients may be included if they are undergoing an elective cosmetic liposuction. Following inf ormed consent and screening evaluations, eligible subjects 
will undergo pre -operative testing. Subjects will then undergo a fat harvest using local anesthesia 
with or without conscious sedating. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a fat graft cel l 
enriched with ADRCs (available in two different doses), a fat graft without cell enrichment using a visually -matched blood saline solution (fat alone control), or a saline injection (no- fat control) 
in a 2:2:2:1 ratio.  
 
While undergoing liposuction, lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_373258]. After the liposuction is completed), patients will have, under a ring block local anesthesia (see furth er description below), a subcutaneous scalp injection of either Puregraft purified autologous 
fat or saline (no -fat control) followed by a separate second injection, of either ADRCs (available 
in two different doses), a visually -matched blood saline soluti on (fat alone control), or saline (no-  
fat control) in a 2:2:2:1 ratio.  
 
 
All subjects will undergo clinical evaluations and laboratory testing prior to and after the 
procedure as outlined in Section 9.0, Study Assessments, and in the Schedule of Procedures 
(Appendix A).

6 CELUTION & PUREGRAFT  SYSTEMS  
 
6.1 Celution& Puregraft System  Descriptions  
 
The Celution System consists of a stand -alone re -useable hardware unit called the Celution 
Device, the Celution Consumable Set, and Celase®. The Celution System prepares an ADRC 
output from adipose tissue collected by [CONTACT_373297].  
STYLE; Version B 
24 November 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 53   Following the collection of tissue, the adipose tissue is introduced into the device’s collection 
canister in order to wash the adipose tissue and remove deleterious substances (such as cellular debris)(Detailed instructions for use are found in the Celution User Manual, the Celution Consumable IFU and the Celase IFU ). 
 
The Puregraft [ADDRESS_467295] to an off -the-shelf sterile luer lock syringe and its attached slider is used to facilitate the 
movement of liquids through the filter mesh and out of the Puregraft bag through the drain stub as waste. Detailed instructions for use are found in the Puregraft IFU).  
 
6.2 Device Characterization and Intended  Use 
 
In combination with the Puregraft 50 System, the Celution System (Ce lution Device, Celution 
Consumables Set, and Celase reagent) is intended to digest adipose tissue in order to further extract, wash and concentrate adipose derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) intended for combination with autologous fat and reimplantation s ubcutaneously into the scalp for 
investigational use in the STYLE clinical trial.  
 
The Puregraft 50 System is intended to process and purify adipose tissue to be combined with concentrated stromal stem cells and other associated progenitor cells intended f or autologous 
implantation subcutaneously into the scalp for investigational use in the STYLE clinical trial.  
 
6.3 Contraindications  
 
1. Non-autologous use is  contraindicated  
2. Use of any tissues other than adipose is  contraindicated  
 
6.4 Intended Clinical  Performance  
 
The Celution System is designed to process lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_373279]. When ADRCs are 
prepared using the Celution System, the resultant cell suspension contains all of the components naturally occurring in the native tissue. Preparation of autologous ADRCs for subcutaneous delivery using the Celution System involves  no cell culture and can be prepared and re- implanted 
into the same patient within three hours from completion of lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. 
 
The total viable cell count and percentage viability for each sample will be used as the 
acceptance criteria. This will be as sessed for each patient to decide whether the cell output is 
acceptable, and to prepare the prescribed dose. The viable cell count will be performed by [CONTACT_373298]® Automated Cell Counting System. Using a small sample 
of the Ce lution System output, the NucleoCounter Automated Cell Counting System provides a 
count of both live and dead nucleated cells in the total sample. All personnel involved will be 
trained according to standardized procedures and work instructions. Cytori has  performed 
characterizations  of the live cell output  obtained by [CONTACT_373324]; Version B 
24 November 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 53   70% viability or greater. This sample count is used to calculate the total number of live nucleated 
cells from the total preparation, to arrive at percentage of viable cells that are available for introduction into the patient. 
 
The Puregraft System is designed to prepare purified lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. This purification involves the near complete removal of free lipid, RBCs, and WBC s. All personnel involved will be trained 
according to standardized procedures and work instructions. 
 
6.5 Celution& Puregraft System Output; Physical, Chemical, and  Pharmaceutical 
Properties of ADRCs  
 
The output of the Celution System is an ADRC output obtained from autologous lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_373280]. The suspension of viable ADRCs has been characterized with an average viability of  
>70% and the average yield is 3.24 x 10
5 ± 1.48 of mononuclear cells per gram of adipose tissue 
entered into the Celution Syste m. An index of regenerative cell potential, the CFU -F assay, 
shows that 1.51% of those ADRCs form colonies (mean range of 0.13 to 4.08% colony forming units). 
The product is a suspension of cells in a diluent. The cellular components of the suspension are 
made up of nucleated and non- nucleated cells. The non -nucleated cells are red blood cells (RBC) 
that comprise > 95% of the total cell suspension. The nucleated cells make up approximately 0.1  
– 5% of the total cell suspension. Nucleated cells are present i n the following approximate 
minimum percentages: CD 31
+, CD 34+ (> 2%); CD 34+, CD 31-, CD  45-  (>  10%); CD  45+, 
CD 31 -, CD 34-  (> 15%). The combination of these three phenotypes will account for greater 
than 90% of nucleated cells in the product. Table 1 summarizes the ADRC cellular suspension 
processed by [CONTACT_373300].

Puregraft 50 System  
 
The Puregraft 50 System is used in conjunction with a lipoplasty device (user supplied) and does 
not contact [CONTACT_373301]. The Puregraft 50 System is only used on the back table in the operating room to rinse and filter an adipose tissue graft and prepare the  
graft for eventual injection back into the same patient during the same surgical procedure. The Puregraft 50 System is a bag with two tubing stubs/ports (tissue and drain) and is designed to harvest, rinse and filter the adipose tissue, and subsequently d rain excess rinse solution away  
STYLE; Version B 
24 November 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 53   from the adipose tissue. The rinsed and filtered adipose tissue is then removed from the Puregraft 
bag using syringes (user supplied) and ultimately transplanted back into the same patient. The Puregraft 50 Sys tem includes a slider tool that is attached to the exterior of the Puregraft bag. 
The slider is used to compress the Puregraft bag as a means to facilitate the movement of liquids through the filter mesh and out of the Puregraft bag through the drain stub/ port as  waste.

ameliorating injury by [CONTACT_373325]. Viability characterization of ADRCs as 
described above in addition to pre -clinical animal data from Cytori and other published reports 
support this hypothesis. 
 
 
7 STUDY TREATMENTS  
 
Subjects will be randomized 2:2:2:1 to active treatment (autologous fat enriched with ADRCs), 
autologous fat alone control, or no- fat control as follows:  
Active (0.5 x 106 ADRCs/cm2 scalp):  20 Subjects  
Active (1.0 x 106 ADRCs/cm2 scalp):  20 Subjects 
Autologous fat alone  control:  20 Subjects  
No-fat control (saline)  10 Subjects  
 
The study treatment will be administered as subcutaneous injections of either fat or saline into 
the subcutaneous fat layer of the scalp (40cm2 of scalp) of each subject. Each square centimeter 
of scalp will be injected  with 0.1 mL of purified autologous fat or saline followed by [CONTACT_373326]2 scalp, or saline (fat alone control 
and the no -fat control). To account for the variability seen in advanced grades of hair l oss 
(Norwood Grade II and IV), treatment areas will be focused in the mid- scalp and crown (vertex). 
The leading edge of hair loss will not be treated, including the peri -orbital region as fat grafting 
in the peri -orbital region has been associated with hig her-risk complications.

7.1.1 Active Treatment Dose Control  
 
Autologous adipose purified with the Puregraft System can be readily removed directly with a sterile 1mL syringe to obtain a volume of 0.1mL for injection. 
 
ADRC Cell count and viability will be controlled using the NucleoCounterAutomated Cell Counting System (Enfield, CT) at each site using the following acceptance criteria:  
 
• Nominal cell count: 40 x 106 ADRCs  
• A minimum cell count within  50% of the nominal cell count is required (i.e., a dose as 
low as 20 x 106 ADRCs is acceptable if 40 x 106 ADRCs is not be  available)  
• Cell viability: ≥ 70%  
If cell viability is <70%, as determined by [CONTACT_373303], the s ubject will not be treated.  
• Negative result in Gram stain testing (see Section  7.3) 
7.[ADDRESS_467299] Description – Control  Doses  
 
The fat alone control dose will be purified autologous tissue prepared by [CONTACT_373327]. The amount of fat injected will be 0.1 mL/cm2 
of scalp. The fat alone control dose will also include injection of a saline solution which is mixed 
with 0.1mL to 0.[ADDRESS_467300]’s own freshly drawn blood to achieve a dilution that 
is visually indistinguishable from ADRCs. The saline injection of the fat -alone control must test 
negative in a Gram stain test of sterility prior to being administered (see Section 7.3) . Prepar ation 
of the fat -alone control dose is provided in the Study Reference  Manual . 
 
The no- fat control dose will be 0.1ml/cm2 of scalp of saline injected (delivered by a blunt tip 
cannula) followed by a second matching dose of saline solution (via a 25G needle ) to 0.1ml/cm2 
of scalp.  
 
7.2.1 Justification of Control Dose  
 
To reduce the risk of bias (selection bias, performance bias, detection bias and attrition bias), all 
patients will undergo pre -specified screening procedures, fat harvest, and injection of active 
treatment or placebo. The justification and rationale of the placebo dose arm include:

[ADDRESS_467301] result is required prior to injection of ADRCs and/or fat alone control. A ne gative Gram stain test result is not required prior to injection of saline in the no -fat control 
arm. If the sample is determined to be positive for bacteria then the cellular administration procedure must be stopped and the subject should not receive any study treatment.  
 
Further testing (BacT Alert Culture and Sensitivity) will be performed in order to test for the presence of any low level microbial contamination that might not be apparent in the gram stain test. Should a culture be deemed positive for m icrobial activity, the investigator will be 
immediately notified. The study patient will be evaluated and a course of treatment and/or antibiotics may be administered, as determined by [CONTACT_1704]. The source of the contamination will be evaluated as appropriate. The FDA and IRB will be notified within [ADDRESS_467302]  results.

24 November 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 53   In order to characterize the phenotype of ADRCs obtained from patients with alopecia 
androgenetica, adipose tissue will be obtained during the elective cosmetic liposuction.; up to 360 mL of this tissue (maximum that can be processed by [CONTACT_373305]) will be used to prepare the act ive study treatment (ADRCs) using the Celution System. Once it is determined 
that the cell dose has been achieved according to criteria described in Section 7.1.1, any 
remaining adipose tissue may be shipped to an outsourced facility of the Sponsor (if within two 
hours of the outsourced laboratory) according to procedures outlined in the Study Reference Manual . 
 
In the Sponsor’s outsourced contract laboratory, ADRCs will be prepared from collected adipose tissue using the sam e Celution System as used in the clinic and the cell output characterized 
using colony forming unit – fibroblast (CFU -F), a measure of the number of adipose stem cells, 
and multiparametric flow cytometry analyses used to define the major non -progenitor cel l 
populations in ADRCs. In the flow analyses ADRCs will be stained using antibodies directed to CD31, CD34, CD136 and CD45 proteins. Based on the expression of these four markers, the major populations will be defined as follow:  
 
Leukocytes  CD45+  
Endothelial  Cells  CD34+/CD31+/CD45 - 
Stromal Cells  CD34+/CD31- /CD45 -

anticoagulation (e.g.: GIIb/IIIa inhibitor class drugs) within the two weeks prior to fat harvest, or who have an abnormal aPTT. 
• Fat tis sue should be obtained under sterile technique using local anesthesia with or 
without conscious sedation. General anesthesia should not be  used. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Fat Harvest  Procedure 
 
Fat harvest from small volume liposuction is a standard procedure practiced by [CONTACT_373329] a variety of settings and using a variety of techniques. However, a specific set of guidelines have been established for the collection of fat that can then be used for the optimized preparation of ADRCs. These guidelines, which are recommend ations and not requirements, 
include the  following; 
 
· Syringe -based fat harvest is  preferred.  
· Use up to [ADDRESS_467309]  tip 
· 60 mL Toomey syringes are used for tissue  acquisition  
· Use  14 gauge, up to 30 cm, blunt LAMIS infiltrator for tumescent fluid 
administration  
· Symmetric fat removal is required keepi[INVESTIGATOR_373283]; Version B 
24 November 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 53   · The abdominal region is the preferred site for fat  harvest  
 
1. Local anesthesia with or with out conscious sedation; general anesthesia is not permitted 
for fat  harvest  
2. Using sterile technique, prepare up to 3 sites, including the preferred abdomen and 
flanks along with the inner and the outer thighs and the posterior and anterior  thighs.  
3. Make an approximately 0.5 cm stab skin incision  
4. Infiltrate tumescent solution using a blunt LAMIS infiltrator and a volume ratio of 1:1 
of tumescent solution to fat to be  harvested  
 
Tumescent fluid formula:

The following procedure is recommended for subcutaneous injection into the scalp for the 
treatment of baldness due to alopecia androgenetica:  
 
Autologous Fat & Saline Injection 
This fat or saline injection procedure will occur after the completion of the liposuction. Aseptic technique should be maintained throughout the procedure. A treatment grid will be prepared in the area to be treated. The grid is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_373267] a surgical skin marker is used to mark each of the holes which are spaced every centimeter. The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_373268] a lo cal ring block with 1% 
lidocaine with 1:100,[ADDRESS_467314] 
should be given. The maximum dose delivered should not exceed 7mg/kg. Sedation may be employed to minimize patient discomfort at the discretion of the investigator. Tissue from the Puregraft 50 is prepar ed in separate, sterile 1mL luer lock syringes, and an 11 -blade scalpel can 
be used to make a stab incision (incision is made at a strategic insertion point to facilitate access to the area to be treated) to allow insertion of a 0.9mm -1.2mm diameter blunt -tip cannula. This 
cannula is then inserted into the subcutaneous adipose tissue plane and the tip is fanned into each 1 square centimeter grid to deliver 0.1mL of tissue or saline (no- fat control). 
 
ADRC & Saline Injection  
After preparation of the ADRCs, e ither the low or high dose of ADRC or saline will be injected 
using a 25G needle directly through the skin into the layer of subcutaneous adipose using the identical grid markings made in the paragraph described above. Additional local anesthesia ± sedatio n may be applied as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093].

10.1 Risks  
 
The use of adult regenerative cells from adipose tissue and other sources has shown 
improvement in muscular (cardiac) function after injection into ischemic areas of the heart. The PRECISE Clinical Trial has shown an acceptable safety profile and signs of benefits following intramyocardial administration of ADRCs processed by [CONTACT_373311]. Every potential complication of ADRC injections are unknown at this time; however injection of cells from adipose tissue have been delivered with guided intramyoca rdial injections with no clinical 
significant sequelae. A clinical trial of 12 patients with hand dysfunction and pain from scleroderma followed for 6 months showed minor adverse events related to subcutaneous injection, typi[INVESTIGATOR_373269], and no adverse events directly related to  ADRCs.  
 
10.1.1  Subcutaneous Delivery Risk Analysis  
 
Risks involved with subcutaneous delivered adipose plus cells include:  
 
• Hematoma or  bleeding  
• Infection  
• Inflammation, rash, or papules at the injection  site 
• Nerve injury , pain, paresthesias or sensory  disturbances  
• Diminished  function 
• Shock loss  
Direct intramuscular injections of Celase has been carried out in rodent models showing a margin of safety of greater than [ADDRESS_467320] 
injection into the muscle of the heart in the cour se of the PRECISE study exhibited no adverse 
events associated with ADRC injection In addition, a study of 12 patients with subcutaneous 
injection in the fingers of patients with scleroderma showed minor adverse events and no serious adverse events.

11 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
 
This is a multi- centre, single- blinded, randomized, parallel group, controlled study to evaluate 
the preliminary safety of cell -enriched autologous fat compared to placebo in patients with 
baldness due to alopecia androgenetica. The primary endpoint will be the safety and tolerability 
of the  procedure.  
 
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with the baseline measure used as a covariate, will be used for the analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints. Comparisons of each active arm with placebo will be made using Dunnett comparisons. The ITT popul ation will be used for the 
primary analysis; the analysis will also be performed in the PTE population and will be considered as supportive of the ITT analysis.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_467325] data review meeting of the DMC is held, a separate 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be completed, providing detailed methods for the analyses outlined in the following subsect ions. The SAP will detail all planned analyses and will serve as 
a statistical programming requirements  document.  
 
11.2 Determination of Sample Size  
 
The sample size for the trial has been set at 70, based on clinical considerations and is not based on formal power calculations.  
 
The objective of the STYLE Trial is to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of cell -enriched 
autologous adipose delivered via a subcutaneous route in the treatment of baldness due to alopecia androgenetica. As the primary endpoint  is safety and tolerability, the investigators 
believe that a sample of 20 subjects per arm and a 10 patient no- fat saline control is adequate.  
 
11.3 Data  Analyses  
 
Safety and efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_2070] (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum), for quantitative variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Laboratory data will also be summarized using shift tables  
STYLE; Version B 
[ADDRESS_467326] -baseline visit time 
point. Additionall y variables will be analyzed using ANCOVA models with adjustment for the 
baseline value of the variable.  
 
Related adverse events will be analyzed separately for those related to ADRCs and the delivery of ADRCs (i.e., injection site such as shock loss). A s eparate safety analysis will be performed 
for Adverse Events of Interest (Appendix B, Adverse Event Terminology and Grading ). 
 
11.3.1  Primary Endpoint  Analysis  
 
The primary endpoint for the study is safety and tolerability through 24 weeks 
The hypotheses are:  
Adverse event rates through 24 weeks for active treatment will be less than or equal to 
adverse events rates published for autologous fat grafting.  
 
Vital sign abnormalities through 24 weeks for active treatment will be less than or equal to those published for autologous fat grafting.  
 
Physical exam abnormalities through 24 weeks for active treatment will be less than or equal to those published for autologous fat grafting.  
 
The corresponding nul l hypotheses are that the adverse event rates will be greater for active 
treatment arms than for placebo.  
 
Statistical testing will not be performed for these hypotheses, but the safety endpoints will be evaluated clinically.  
 
11.3.2  Secondary and Exploratory Endpoint  Analysis  
 
The secondary endpoints are change from baseline in the (a) Average Trichogram growth rates at 
24 weeks, (b) Average Trichogram density rate at 24 weeks, and (c) global photographs at 24 
weeks and (d) hair Investigator Satisfaction Survey a t [ADDRESS_467327].

11.[ADDRESS_467328] Disposition & Analysis  Populations  
 
Reasons for withdrawal post -randomization will be summarized.  
 
The treatment analyses will be performed on intent -to-treat basis as well as on a per -treatment-  
evaluable basis, as defined below:  
 
Safety:  All treated subjects; subjects will be analyzed as  treated.  
 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) : All randomized subjects; randomization will occur on procedure day prior 
to liposuction. Subjects will be included in the analysis as randomized 
 
Per-Treatment -Evaluable (PTE) : All randomized subjects who have received treatment and 
follow -up information is available. Protocol violators, where the violation is judged to affect the 
interpretation of the treatment effect will be excluded. All exclusions will be made prior to the breaking of the treatment blind. 
 
11.6 Handling of Missing Data 
Safety data will not be imputed. 
PTE data will not be  imputed.  
Missing efficacy data will be imputed for the ITT analysis population. For missing data caused 
by [CONTACT_373315] (either han d or systemic manifestation), the missing value will be 
replaced by [CONTACT_373316]. For other missing data, last observation carried forward will be the primary method of imputation. As a sensitivit y analysis, multiple impute ion methods (SAS PROC MI and PROC MIANALIZE) will 
be used. 
 
For the analysis of quality of life, missing responses to individual questionnaire items will be imputed using the methods prescribed by [CONTACT_373317].  
 
11.7 Prot ocol Deviations  
 
Deviations from the protocol including violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed as “minor” or “major” in cooperation with the Sponsor. Deviations will be defined prior to un-  
blinding. Major deviations may result in remo val from the PTE analysis population. 
 
11.8 Data Monitoring Committee  
 
The independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be comprised of medical specialists and a biostatistician who are not participants in the study. The DMC will be provided with all safety  data as well as efficacy data for the primary and secondary endpoints in order to fully

• Infection of the scalp requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_373272] (2) or  
more patients within seven (7) days of the  procedure  
Within 24 hours of notification, the Sponsor will report the event to the DMC Chair for evaluation. The DMC Chair will review the event and decide whether to convene a meeting of the DMC.  
In all cases, the DMC Chair or the DMC will be responsible for recommendations to continue the trial, continue the trial with modifications, pause the trial such that further evaluation can be conducted, or terminate the  trial. 
 
 
12 ADVERSE EVENTS / SERIOUS ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
12.1 Definitions  
 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a Subject during 
the course of the study, whether or not it is related to the test material or the study procedure. 
Expected adverse events are those t hat are listed as known risks of the liposuction or injection 
procedure including those described in this protocol, informed consent, and/or the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in  death,  
• Is life-threatening,  
• Requires or prolongs Subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacity  
• Is an important medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_373273]  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect.

severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application or any other unanticipated serious problem with the Celution or Puregraft system devices that re lates to the 
rights, safety or welfare of subjects.  
 
12.2 Procedures for AE  Reporting  
 
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_373318] (eCRF). Events that occur prior to the liposuction -related activities, including those that are 
considered serious, are to be recorded in the medical history. Events, including SAEs, which occur after liposuction- related activities are initiated on procedure day, are to be recorded on the 
AE eC RF. The investigator will evaluate the relationship of the adverse event to both the test 
material and study procedure as unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, or definitely related and will record the findings, including all pertinent details of the event on the eCRF. 
 
In addition, the Investigator or designee will report any serious adverse events, including UADE, occurring during this study to the Sponsor and Medical Monitor as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_467331]’s well -being and document 
these measures on the appropriate eCRF.  
 
All serious adverse events experienced will be monitored until the event has resolved, any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or stabilized at a level acceptable to the Investigator and Medical Monitor, or until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed.

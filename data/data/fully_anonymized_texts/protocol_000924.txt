STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Sample Size Calculation
The sample size of 100 subjects followed for 100 EDs originates from EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009; it is not 
based on statistical considerations. 
Planned Statistical Analysis
For the analysis of the primary outcome measure, incidence of FVIII in hibitor development, a Clopper -Pearson 
exact 95% confidence interval (CI) w ill be computed for the proportion of subjects who developed FVIII inhibitors. 
The set of subjects to be analyzed includes all subjects who developed an inhibitor (at any time) conf irmed by a 
central laboratory based on a second repeat blood sample drawn within 2 w eeks of site notification of an inhibitor 
and all subjects who did not develop an inhibitor and had ≥[ADDRESS_1265453] developed a confirmed FVIII inhibitor. 
Binding antibodies to FVIII, BAX 855 and PEG and all other secondary safety outcome measures will be analyzed 
descriptively.
The ABR will be analyzed by [CONTACT_902313] a ne gative binomial model w ith treatment 
regimen (on -demand vs. prophylaxis) as a covariate and the duration of the observation period as an offset. Other 
secondary efficacy outcome measures as well as IR over time w ill be analyzed descriptively.
Outcomes of ITI will be summarized descriptively. Separate analyses of data from subjects dosed w ith the 2 dosing 
regimens of 50 IU/kg 3 x weekly and 100 -200 IU/kg daily will be performed. The analysis of efficacy will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_902314] 855 as a single agent for ITI and subjects w ho used BAX 855 plus an 
immune modulatory agent, if applicable.

PEGylated full -length recombinant factor VIII
Adynovate 261203 Protocol Amendment 8 (Global) [ADDRESS_1265471] (I P), TAK -660 (hereafter referred to as BAX 855), is a poly ethylene 
glycol (PEG) -ylated full -length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII), intended for use as a FVIII 
replacement therap y with an extended half -life in the prophy laxis and treatment of bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_902250] A.
Since the half -life of current FVIII products is in the range of 10 -
14hours1,2, current proph ylaxis 
regimens call for inf usion of FVIII every  other day  or every  2-3 day s when based on each 
patient’s individual pharmacokinetic (PK) profile.3PEGy lation of FVIII is designed to prolong 
the half -life of FVIII, with the intent of reducing the frequency of administration while 
maintaining similar therapeutic benefit as existing FVIII products; improving patie nt 
convenience and compliance with therap y; and thereby  [CONTACT_902315]. 
BAX 855 consists of rFVIII protein molecules (octocog alfa, ADVATE) with covalentl y bound 
PEG chains with a molecular weight of [ADDRESS_1265472] is reconstituted with sterile water for injection (SWFI) and is administered intravenousl y 
(i.v.) as a solution by  [CONTACT_279507]. I t uses the same stabilizing agents (mannitol, trehalose, 
histidine and glutathione) as the rFVII I product from which it is derived. Comprehensive 
preclinical studies as well as a completed Phase 1 study  (Study  261101) and pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 2/3 
study  (Study  261201) have shown that the PEGy lation extends both the in vivo half-life and the 
measurable circulating activity  of the product (as determined by  [CONTACT_902316] -stage 
clotting assay s). Phy siochemical characterization studies demonstrate that the functional activity  
of BAX 855 is comparable to that of ADVATE. Additional details can be found in the BAX 855 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
The current study  is a Phase 3, prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the 
inhibitor risk in previously untreated patients (PUPs) receiving BAX 855 and summarize any 
association with genetic or other risk factors. It will also evaluate the outcome of immune 
tolerance induction (ITI) therap y with BAX [ADDRESS_1265473] 100 pediatric subjects <6 y ears with severe

Adynovate 261203 Protocol Amendment 8 (Global) [ADDRESS_1265474] will be used in this study  for prophy laxis or treatment of bleeding. 
The efficacy  of on -demand dos ing for treatment of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_902251] 10 -60IU/kg 
has been generated in the completed Phase 2/3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_902252] 855 study  (range 6.8 to 61.4 IU/kg). 
Doses as high as 80 IU/kg may  be used for the treatment of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_902253].
The vast range of proph ylactic dosing between 25 -80 IU/kg with vary ing frequencies but at least 
once weekl y reflects the range of treatment approaches in this very young patient population 
across hemophilia centers and co untries. Early  initiation of once weekly  infusions of 25 IU/kg 
before the establishment of a severe bleeding pattern and thus avoiding intensive treatment may  
minimize immune stimulation which may  reduce the risk for inhibitor development. After 
50 EDs the dose and/or frequency  may  be increased.4Also starting very  early  in life with once 
weekl y proph ylactic infusions may  avoid the need for surgical implants which may  become 
necessary  in case of increased frequency of infusions. Once the patient is older, frequency  can be 
increased, often without the need for a central venous device (CVD).5The Canadian regimen, 
which is a tailored -dose/dose -escalation proph ylactic regimen, starts with once weekl y infusions 
of 50 IU/kg which is adjusted according to the patient’s bleeding pattern. Dose and frequency  are 
changed to twice weekly  infusions of 30 IU/kg once the subject develops a target joint. This may  
be further increased to 25 IU/kg q2 day s using regular FVIII concentrates.6
In the completed BAX 855 Phase 2/3 p ivotal study  a dose of 45 ± 5IU/kg twice weekly  
demonstrated that it is efficacious to reduce or prevent bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]; in the Phase 3 
pediatric PTP study  the dose consisted of twice weekly  infusion of 50 ±
10IU/kg which could be 
increased to 80 IU/kg. The Phase 3 continuation study  employ ed the same dosing regimens as in 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_902254], but also allowed a q5 and q7 dosing based on the bleeding 
pattern of the patients in doses up to 80 IU/kg.
The recommended dosing regimens for ITI therapy  of 3 x 50 IU/kg weekly to 
100-200 IU/kg dail y are based on the results of the International ITI stud y which randomized 
patients with high titer inhibitors to a high dose regimen consisting of dail y infusions of 
200IU/kg or a low dose regimen of 3 x50 IU/kg weekl y using a plasma -
derived or recombinant 
FVIII concentrate.7The success rate did not differ between treatment arms but the times taken to 
achieve negative titers were shorter using the high dose regimen. A dose of 100 IU/kg daily is 
also used in many  hemophilia centers but has not been studied in randomized controlled trials.8

 major objective of a prophy lactic treatment in severe hemophilia A patients is to prevent 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], in particular joint blee ding. 
The intended indication for BAX 855 is treatment and prophy laxis of bleeding in subjects with 
hemophilia A. The clinical program of BAX 855 is in compliance with the 
EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/[ADDRESS_1265475] shown t hat proph ylactic administration of FVIII from an earl y age prevents 
arthropath y but also other potentially life -threatening bleeds. Findings of a joint bleed in canine 
knees support the theory  that a single hemarthrosis may  result in permanent joint damage since 
every  intra -articular bleed precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263] a biological cascade despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a rapid clearance of blood.11
Astermark et al examined how the age that treatment is started affects joint outcome in patient s 
with severe hemophilia (108 with hemophilia A and 13 with hemophilia B) and found that 
starting proph ylaxis before the age of 3 years resulted in better outcomes as compared to age 
groups starting proph ylaxis at either 3 -5 years or 6- 9 years, but emphasi zed that treatment can be 
individualized according to the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103].12In a randomized study which enrolled 
65subjects between 1996 and 2000, it was found that prophy laxis (every  other day ) with rFVIII 
can prevent joint damage, as assessed b y x-ray or MRI  of bone or cartilage damage , with a 
decrease in the frequency of joint bleeds and other bleeds in y oung boy s (<30 months of age) 
with severe hemophilia A.13Most of the children had fewer than 50 EDs at the time of 
enrollment. Of the 27 boy s on pro phylaxis, 25 (93%) had no joint damage compared to 16 of 29 
(55%) with on -demand therap y. Two children in the proph ylaxis group developed high titer 
FVIII inhibitor. Three subjects receiving on -demand therap y had life -threatening bleeds. A 
tailored proph ylactic regimen based on initial once- weekl y proph ylaxis was found to be effective 
in a prospective stud y in [ADDRESS_1265476] devel oped a transient 
inhibitor.6
MASAC (Medical and Scientific Advisory  Council from the National Hemophilia Foundation) 
recommends that proph ylaxis be considered optimal therap y for patients with severe hemophilia 
A began at a young age consistent with primary  prophy laxis.9Primary  prophy laxis is the 
long-term continual treatment either started before the age 2 years or started prior to the onset of 
joint damage (presumptively  defined as not more than one joint hemorrhage, irrespective of age). 
Secondary proph ylaxisisdefined as a long -term continual prophy laxis initiated after multiple 
joint bleeds and the onset of joint damage.14
6.2.1 Inhibitor Development and Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI)
The development of inhibitors to FVIII leads to serious complications of hemophilia therap y. 
The overall incidence of inhibitor development in PUPs is approximately  30% in patients with 
severe hemophilia A.15FVIII inhibitors are quantified according to the inhibition of FVIII

 activity  on the one -stage clotting assay , or the Bethesda assay  with Nijmegen modification. High 
responder inhibitors with Bethesda titer >[ADDRESS_1265477] 9 -10 day s of exposure to FVIII.21
,22Ofthose 
patients who eventuall y develop inhibitors, 50% develop them within the first 20 EDs, 95% 
within the fir st 50 EDs and >99% within the first 150 EDs.23A retrospective cohort stud y of 
366PUPs with severe hemophilia A in the multic enter European/Canadian Concerted Action on 
Neutralizing Antibodies in Severe Hemophilia A (CANAL) study  did not identify  FVIII product 
class or switch as a risk forinhibitor development.24The C ANAL  study  also identified age at 
first exposure to FVIII to be a risk factor; however, this association disappeared in a multivariate 
analysis where intensity  of treatment was considered. Earl y surgical procedures (relative risk 
(RR) 3.7, 95% confidence i nterval (CI) 2.0 -7.1) and major “peak treatment epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]” with 
high doses of FVIII (RR 3.3, CI  2.1-5.3) were independentl y related to a higher risk of inhibitor 
development. Clinically  relevant inhibitors developed in 24% of patients with 19% developi[INVESTIGATOR_860954]-titer inhibitors. Further anal ysis suggested that initiation of scheduled FVIII infusions 
(proph ylaxis) begun at a y oung age results in a 60% lower risk of inhibitor formation (RR, 0.4; 
CI, 0.2- 0.8) .24A study  in [ADDRESS_1265478].25Inhibitory  antibodies 
developed in 177/574 children (cumulative incidence, 32.4%); the cumulative incidence of 
high-titer inhibitors was 22.4%. There was a similar risk of inhibitor development with 
plasma -derived products and recombinant products (adjusted hazard ratio as compared with 
recombinant products, 0.96; 95% CI , 0.62 to 1.49). The only  difference between products was 
found between second -and third -generation full -length recombinant products, with an increased 
risk of inhibitor development associated with secon d-generation products (adjusted hazard ratio,

 1.60; 95% CI , 1.08 to 2.37). Switching between products did not increase the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_559580]. Prophy laxis is the recommended approach in [LOCATION_013]  and a review of the 
experiences at hemophilia cente rs in Frankfurt, Bremen and Munich in developi[INVESTIGATOR_902255] y stages of treatment may contribute to the low incidence of inhibitors in PUPs 
at these centers.26Such a regimen was tested in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9985] 26 PUPs and compared with 
historical controls.4The regimen consists of 25 IU/kg FVIII infused once weekl y generall y 
started ear ly, preferably  at ED 1. Fourteen of [ADDRESS_1265479] prophy laxis but only  1 
of the 26 subjects given the new regimen, starting with once -weekl y 25–35IU/kg, developed an 
inhibitor (P = 0.0003, OR 0.048, 95% CI
: 0.001– 0.372). In a report on the longer -term follow up 
of these patients after >150 EDs, no further patients developed an inhibitor.27However, these 
results could not be confirmed in the EPI C study  (Early Prophylaxis Immunologic Challenge). 
Of 19 treated sub jects, 8 developed confirmed inhibitors, 5 ofwhich were low titers ranging 
from 0.6 to 1.5 BU/mL. Both subjects with a confirmed low titer of 0.6 BU/mL  tested negative 
for binding antibodies to FVIII (IgA, IgM, IgG, IgG 1-4).28The lack of the c oncomitant presence 
of binding antibodies to FVIII indicates the potential need to clarify  the real nature of borderline 
inhibitory  activity . 
In a prospective trial of 55 PUPs and minimally  treated patients (MTPs) with severe/moderatel y 
severe hemophilia A (baseline FVIII ≤2%) treated with ADVATE given either prophy lacticall y 
or on demand, inhibitory antibodies to FVIII developed in 16/55 (29.1%; 95% CI : 17.1% -41.1%) 
subjects.29The odds ratio (OR [95% CI ]) of developi[INVESTIGATOR_902256] a family  history  of inhibitor (4.95 [1.29–19.06]), non- Caucasian ethnicity  (4.18 
[1.18 –14.82]), and intensive treatment at high dose (4.5 [1.05 –19.25]) (mean dose of 
≥50IU/kg/day  for at leas t 5 consecutive day s) within ≤20 EDs. The hemostatic efficacy , both to 
treat bleeds and for surgical proph ylaxis, was established.
6.3
Population To Be Studied
PUPs <6 y ears of age with severe hemophilia A (FVIII <1%) and <3 EDs to ADVATE, 
BAX 855 or plasma tr ansfusion will be studied.
Justification for enrollment of pediatric subjects is based on the requirements outlined in the 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) M3 and E11 guidelines.30,31Pediatric subjects 
are expected to benefit from a full -length rFVIII molecule with an extended half -life. Moreover, 
results from nonclinical repeated toxicology  studies, the core safet y pharmacology package, and 
the clinical studies performed with BAX [ADDRESS_1265480] not raised an y safet y or tolerability concerns. 
Also, according to the EMA guidelines10, this clinical study  in PUPs will not start until data are 
available from 20 PTPs <[ADDRESS_1265481] been

 investigations in children <12 y ears are completed. The data will be reviewed by  [CONTACT_204778] (DMC) before the start of the trial. Furthermore, the parent protein 
molecule ADVATE has been used extensivel y in the entire pediatric pop ulation with no 
unforeseen adverse events (AEs; see ADVATE package insert). 
6.4Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
6.4.1 Findings from Nonclinical Studies
Octocog alfa is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary  (CHO) cells by  a plasma/albumin free cell 
culture method and is the active substance in licensed product ADVATE. Thus, the viral safet y 
of BAX [ADDRESS_1265482] comparable activity  and other 
biochem ical properties to ADVATE. The expected prolonged FVIII exposure by  [CONTACT_279511] 855 was 
demonstrated in PK studies with a mean residence time (MRT) longer than ADVATE in FVIII 
knock -out- mice (1.6 -fold), rats (1.2- fold) and cynomolgus monkey s (1.5- fold). Prolonged 
efficacy  was shown for BAX [ADDRESS_1265483] -in-human prospective, open label, crossover, dose -escalation study  to evaluate safet y and 
PK parameters of single doses of BAX 855 compared to single doses of ADVATE was 
conducted in 19 adult PTPs with severe hemophilia A (FVIII <1%) (Study 261101). The mean 
half-life was 1.4- and 1.5 -fold higher for BAX 855 compared to ADVATE in Cohorts 1 
(30IU/kg) and 2 (60 IU/kg), respectively, demonstrating an extended half -life for BAX 855 
compared to ADVATE. No subjects developed inhibitory  antibodies to FVIII or binding 
antibodies to FVIII, PEG- FVIII or PEG after a single BAX 855 infusion. There were no notable 
differences in the t ype or rate of AEs experienced by [CONTACT_902318] 855. Based on these data, BAX 855 was shown to be safe and well tolerated after 
single dose administration, which supported the use of the BAX 855 dosing regimens planned in 
the Phase 2/3 Study  261201.
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], phase 2/3, multicenter, non -randomized open label study  in 138 adult and adolescent 
≥12 y ears male PTPs with severe hemophilia A demonstrated that BAX 855 is safe and 
efficacious in treating bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_902257]-commercial use only

 weekl y (45 ±5 IU/kg) (Study  261201). BAX 855 extended the mean half- life b y approximately 
1.4-fold and MRT b y approximately  1.5 -fold as compared to known data for ADVATE and 
confirmed the data obtained in the Phase 1 study . Twice weekl y proph ylactic infusions resulted 
in an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) which was significantl y lower than that observed with on 
demand treatment with a prophy laxis/on -demand ABR ratio of 0.10. Approximately  40% of 
subjects treated on prophy laxis did not experience any bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], while all subjects 
treated on- demand experienced bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. No FVIII inhibitory  antibodies or persistent 
binding antibodies against FVIII, PEG -FVIII, PEG, or CHO proteins were reported, and no 
safet y signals were identified.
An interim anal ysis of the surgery  study  (261204) in PTPs aged 2- 75 years of age was performed 
once 15 surgeries in 15 subjects were completed. It was based on 11 major ([ADDRESS_1265484] removal, 1 port placement, and 1 gastric band insertion) and 4 minor surgeries 
(1synoviorthesis, 1 radiosy novectomy , 1tooth extraction, and 1 dermatological). Results 
indicate that BAX [ADDRESS_1265485] been identified.

data from the Phase 3 surgery  study , as well as the hemostatic efficacy  and safet y data from the 
Phas e 3 pediatric stud y in PTPs <12 y ears of age. Based on the comparability  of BAX 855 to

of ADVATE (29.1%; 95% CI : 17.1% -41.1%).29

 8.STUDY DESIGN
8.1Brief Summary
This study  is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, multicenter study  to assess the safet y, 
immunogenicit y and hemostatic efficacy of BAX 855 in PUPs <6 y ears of age with severe 
hemophilia A (baseline FVIII level <1%) and <[ADDRESS_1265492] 100 evaluable subjects. Subjects will receive prophy lactic and/or on- demand t herap y with 
BAX [ADDRESS_1265493] developed a confirmed FVIII inhibitor (Part A). 
During Part A, subjects can undergo surgical or invasive procedures under a protocol -defined 
regimen for BAX 855. Subjects who develop a high titer FVIII inhibitor or subjects with low 
titer FVIII inhibitors where ITI therap y is necessary because of poorl y controlled bleeding

8.2Overall Study Design 
This study  is a Phase 3, prospective, uncontrolled, open
-label, multicenter study to assess the 
safet y, immunogenicity and hemostatic efficacy of BAX 855 in a total of 100 evaluable PUPs 
<6years o f age with 
severe hemophilia A (baseline FVIII level <1%) . The overall study  design 
is illustrated in Figure 1. Approximately  120 subjects will be enrolled.
Subjects will be screened per protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria and, following confirmation of 
eligibility , will receive the first administrat ion of BAX 855 at the study  site during the baseline 
visit to determine I R (or the optional abbreviated PK assessment for half
-life).
In the main study  (Part A), subjects will complete study  visits as follows to undergo safet y, 
immunogenicit y, and hemostat ic efficacy  assessments: Baseline Visit, Visits 1 to 3 after every  
5 ±1 EDsxuntil 20 ±2 EDs at Visit 4, Visits 5 and 6 after each 10 ± 3 EDs, Visit 7 at 
50-55 EDs, Visit 8 at 75 ± 5 EDs; and the Study  Completion/Termination Visit for follow -up at 
100-110 EDs. After each study  visit following baseline, an IR will be determined except at 
Visit 1 (ED 5 ± 1),Visit 3 (ED 15 ± 1) and Visit 5 (ED 30 ± 3) when IR will be optional. If a 
subject is less than 3 years of age and has less than 2 joint bleeds, on -dema nd therapy  with 
BAX 855 is permitted at a dose of 10
-50IU/kg, up to 80 I U/kg, depending on the severit y of the 
bleeding. Proph ylactic treatment consists of at least once weekl y dosing of 25- 50 IU/kg, which 
may be increased to 80 IU/kg, at the discretion o f the investigator. Proph ylactic dosing regimens 
of [ADDRESS_1265494] be initiated before the age

(≥0.6 BU/mL but ≤5 BU/mL ) that the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_902258] [ADDRESS_1265497] 
will discontinue I TI therapy , resume his original treatment regimen with BAX 855 and will 
transition back to Part A. By [CONTACT_902320] A or Part B, based on 
local lab inhibitor results.
In the ITI portion of the study, subjects will complete a Screening and Baseline Visit which may 
coincide, Visit 1 at Week 2 ± 2 day s, Visit 2 at Week 4 ± 2 day s, and subsequent visits every  
month ±1 week, up to 33 months of total I TI treatment. The ITI therapy  ranges between 50 IU/kg 
3 xweekly  to 100-200 IU/kg dail y atthe discretion of the inv estigator and according to the 
institution’s standard of care.
An IR determination will be performed once [ADDRESS_1265498] been obtained and will be repeated until I R is ≥66% of the initial I R value (by  [CONTACT_902321]-stage and chromogenic methods). The IR should be performed after the longest time interval 
possible (preferabl y 48 hours) without undue interruption to the I TI therap y schedule. 
If IR is ≥66% of the initial baseline value:
ITI should be continued and I R wit h BAX [ADDRESS_1265499] time interval possible without undue interruption 
to the I TI therapy  schedule. 
If IR is again ≥66% of initial value, I TI therapy  will be continued and a FVIII ha lf-life 
determination performed within [ADDRESS_1265500] 84 -96 h. 
When I R is ≥66% of the initial value and FVIII half- life ≥6 hours, ITI will be considered 
successful.

 If IR is ≥66% of the initial value and FVIII half -life <6 hours, ITI will be continued, and 
IR and half -life repeated at intervals no greater than 1 month apart. 
The high -dose IT I with BAX 855 will be gradually reduced over a 2 -3-month period to a 
twice weekly  prophy laxis:

200IU/kg/day ; 
then 50 ±5 IU/kg/day  for a further 4 weeks; 
then 50 ±5 IU/kg every  second day  for a further 4 weeks; 
then 50 ±5 IU/kg administered twice a week, adjusted as needed to maintain a FVIII 
trough level of 1% , for a further 3 months.
After the three -month follow -up period with twice weekl y proph ylaxis, a 
Completion/Termination Visit will be performed. 
Subjects will be monitored for inhibitor recurrence prior to each dose adjustment and 
at the end of the three -month follow -up period using inhibitory  and binding 
antibodies and FVIII recovery  measurements. After this period, a 
Completion/Termination Visit will be performed (see Figure 2). 
Subjects receiving low dose ITI therap y with 3 x 50 IU/kg weekl y will be transitioned to 
twice weekly  50 IU/kg, adju sted as needed to maintain a FVIII trough level of 1%, for a 
further 3 months. After this period, a Completion/Termination Visit will be performed at 
a time deemed feasible by [CONTACT_317238]. 
If BAX 855 IR is <66% of the initial baseline value: 
ITI therap y should be continued and BAX [ADDRESS_1265502] time 
interval possible (preferably  48 hours), however, without undue interruption to the I TI 
therap y schedule until BAX 855 I R is ≥66% of the initial value. 
ITI should be continued and I R with BAX [ADDRESS_1265503] time interval possible without undue interruption 
to the I TI therapy  schedule. 
If IR is a gain ≥66% of initial value, the same procedures should be followed as described 
above.
If IR is ≥66% of initial baseline IR, but FVIII half- life is <6 hours, ITI will be continued 
and I R and half -life repeated monthly .

 If FV III half -life remains <6 hours and/or IR remains <66% of initial baseline value, 
these assessments should be repeated monthly  until a maximum of 33 months of ITI has 
been provided and a Completion/Termination Visit will be performed. 
In case no baseline IR of Part A is available, the s ame procedures as described above 
should be performed. The baseline IR value of 66% is replaced by  [CONTACT_902322] p rophy lactic treatment of the study  
subject, including maintenance of FVIII levels above 1%.
A Completion/Termination Visit will also be performed in case of a partial success or failure 
after 33 months of ITI therapy or failure in terms of decline in the i nhibitor titer of <20%, 
relative to the peak inhibitor titer, in any  six-month period after the first 3 months of I TI therap y 
(in the absence of infection which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_902259]).
If a subject requires a surgical intervention during the main study  (Part A), the subject’s dosing 
of BAX 855 will be adjusted based on the IR (and half -life, if available) and whether the 
procedure being performed is major or minor. Multiple surgeries are permitted in Part A; each 
will be recorded as a separate procedure. The surgery  arm will not appl y to the ITI part (Part B) 
of the study  because if a subject requires a surgical intervention during this period, by [CONTACT_902323]. Therefore, subjects may  remain in the study  and undergo surgical 
interventions with by [CONTACT_902324] y, but there will be no specific protocol- defined regimens or 
assessments in Part B.
The study  design is in compliance with the EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 guidelines for the 
study  of FVIII in hemophilia A.10
8.3 Duration of Study Period(s) and Subject Participation

8.7.1 Packaging, Labeling, and Storage
BAX 855 is formulated as a sterile, highl y purified protein preparation in lyophilized form for 
i.v. infusion and is provided in single -dose vials with a vial of diluent (2 mL  or 5 mL SWFI, as 
available). A butterfl y transfer set with luer -lock syringes an d a needleless transfer device 
(BAXJECT II high -flow (HF) or BAXJECT III, as available) will be used for reconstitution and 
bolus i.v. delivery . The BAXJECT sy stem is a needleless liquid transfer device with the primary  
function of transferring diluent fro m its vial into an evacuated vial containing product requiring 
reconstitution prior to infusion. Other transfer sets may  be employ ed as applicable to take into 
account the use of a central venous device. Four potencies of BAX 855 may  be used, depending 
upon availability : 250, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 IU/vial. Potencies of BAX 855 with 750 I U/vial, 
1500 IU/vial and 3000 IU/vial may  be added when they  are available.
The recommended storage conditions for BAX 855 are 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) and it should 
not be 
allowed to freeze. BAX [ADDRESS_1265513] should ideally  be used immediately  but no longer than 3 hours after reconstitution.
For additional information, such as reconstitution instructions, please refe r to the BAX 855 IB 
and/or other specific instructions provided b y the sponsor.
8.7.2 Administration
Following reconstitution, BAX 855 should be administered using plastic s yringes provided b y 
the sponsor since proteins such as BAX 855 may  adhere to the surface of glass sy ringes. 
BAX 855 will be administered i.v. using an appropriately  sized s yringe, as a bolus infusion with 
a maximum infusion rate of 10 mL/min, as described in the BAX [ADDRESS_1265514] be administered at room temperature and within 3 hours.

PK assessment and IR determination
For the optional, abbreviated PK assessment and all IR determinations, only  vials of the same lot 
should be used, preferably with a nominal potency  of 500 IU. In order to ensure accurate dosing, 
whole vial doses should be administered and partial vials should be avoided. Vials of 250 IU potency  
may be used in subjects with low body weight to ensure a more precise dosing. 
All other infusions (prophylaxis, treatment of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], perioperative ma nagement 
and ITI therapy)
Different lots and nominal potencies per infusion may be used, however, each vial must be 
reconstituted with its own kit. The total calculated dose can be rounded up or down to the nearest 
whole vial.
8.7.3 Description of Treatment
BAX 855 will be administered at the Baseline Visit and at all study visits except for the following 
visits when both the IP infusion and IR determination are optional: Visit 1 (5 ± 1 EDs prior to visit), 
Visit 3 (15 ± 1 EDs prior to visit), and Visit 5 (30 ± 3EDs prior to visit), (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
During the main study  (Part A) subjects will receive either prophy laxis (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and/or 
on-demand therapy  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) but prophy lactic treatment must be initiated before the age 
of 3years or once the subject has experienced [ADDRESS_1265516] will receive ITI therapy  as 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
In Parts A and B, IP will be dispensed at the study  visits to provide sufficient treatment, at least until 
the next scheduled visit, or as appropriate. According to each study  site´s standard of care and 
depending on the ty pe of regimen, IP may  also be dispensed more frequently .
[IP_ADDRESS] BAX 855 Dosing for IR Assessment at Study Site
Part A : At baseline the re should be a wash -out period of at least [ADDRESS_1265517] FVIII 
therapy , if applicable. For IR determination, after a pre -infusion blood draw within 30 minutes of 
infusion, it is recommended to infuse 50 ± 5IU/kg of BAX 855, followed by  a post -infusion blood 
draw at 15 -30 minutes. In case of on -demand therapy or low dose prophy lactic treatment, a lower 
dose for IR determination may  be considered but should not be lower than 25 IU/kg. For post -
baseline visits, whenever possible, there must be a min imum wash -out of [ADDRESS_1265518] 
BAX 855 infusion; the timing of the BAX [ADDRESS_1265519]’s prophy lactic treatment regimen, if applicable.

 Part B : In Part B, IR is assessed once a subject has 2 negative inhibitor titers within a two- month 
period and will be repeated until I R is ≥66% of the initial baseline I R value following the first 
BAX 855 infusion for IR determination in Part A (by  [CONTACT_902326] -stage and chromogenic methods). 
The I R determination should alway s be performed after the longest time interval possible 
(preferabl y 48 hours) without undue interruption to the ITI therap y schedule. The recommended 
dose for IR determination in Part B is 50 ± 5IU/kg, however, in order to avoid undue 
interruption of ITI therapy , the same ITI dose may be used for I R determination. 
If the first IR is ≥66% of the initial baseline value:
ITI should be continued and I R with BAX 855 repeated within 2 months (minimum 
2weeks) after a wash -out period of at least 84- [ADDRESS_1265520] time interval possible 
without undue interruption to the I TI therapy  schedule. 
If IR is again ≥66% of initial value, I TI therapy  will be continued and a FVIII half- life 
determination performed within [ADDRESS_1265521] 84 -96 h. 
When I R is ≥66% of initial value and FVIII half -life is ≥6 hours, ITI will be considered 
successful. 
The high -dose IT I with BAX 855 will be gradually reduced over a 2 -
3-month period to a 
twice weekly  prophy laxis:
100
±5 IU/kg/day  for the first 4 weeks (± 1 week), in case subject’s ITI therap y 
consisted of 200 IU/kg/day ; 
50 ± 5 IU/kg/day  for a further 4 weeks (± 1 week); 
50 ± 5 IU/kg every  second day  for a further 4 weeks (± 1 week);
50 ± 5 IU/kg administered twi ce weekly , adjusted as needed to maintain a FVIII 
trough level of 1%, for a further 3 months.
After the three -month follow -up period with twice weekl y proph ylaxis, a 
Completion/Termination Visit will be performed. 
Subjects will be monitored for inhibitor recurrence prior to each dose adjustment and 
at the end of the three -month follow -up period using FVIII binding and inhibitory  
antibodies and FVIII recovery  measurements.
After this period, a Completion/Termination Visit will be performed.

 Subjects receiv ing low dose ITI therapy  with 3 x 50 IU/kg weekl y will be transitioned to 
twice weekly  50 IU/kg, adjusted as needed to maintain a FVIII trough level of 1%, for a 
further 3 months. After this period, a Completion/Termination Visit will be performed.
If BAX 855 IR is <66% of the initial baseline value: 
ITI therap y should be continued and BAX [ADDRESS_1265522] BAX 855 infusion (preferabl y 48 hours), however, without 
undue interruption to the ITI therap y schedule until BAX 855 IR is ≥66% of initial value. 
ITI should be continued and I R with BAX [ADDRESS_1265523] time interval 
possible without undue interrup tion to the ITI therapy  schedule.
If IR is again ≥66% of the initial value, the same procedures should be followed as 
described above.
If IR remains <66% of the initial value, it should be repeated until a maximum of 
33months of I TI has been provided and a Completion/Termination Visit will be 
performed. 
If IR is confirmed to be 
≥66% of initial baseline IR, but FVIII half -life is <6 hours, ITI 
will be continued and IR and half- life repeated monthly . If FVIII half -life remains 
<6hours and/or IR remains <66% of the initial value, these assessments should be 
repeated monthly  until a maximum of 33 months of ITI has been provided and a 
Completion/Termination Visit will be performed.
In case no initial baseline IR is available, the same procedures as described a bove should be 
performed, and an IR indicative of an adequate clinical response, as assessed by [CONTACT_093], 
will be used as the criterion. An adequate clinical response isdefined as pharmacokinetic 
parameters that permit effective proph ylactic treat ment of the study  subject, including 
maintenance of FVIII levels above 1%.
[IP_ADDRESS] BAX 855 Dosing for PK Assessment
Part A : An optional abbreviated PK assessment to determine half-life can be performed at 
baseline, Visit 1, or Visit 2. The dosing for this PK is th e same as the dosing for IR assessment 
consisting of 50 ±5 IU/kg. If applicable, subjects should undergo a wash out period of at least 
72hours if they  received prior FVIII treatment (84 -96 hours if prior extended half- life FVIII 
treatment).

Part B : The same timepoints to determine FVIII half -life as desc ribed for Part A also appl y for 
Part B. In Part B, FVIII half-life (PK) is determined (using 50 ± 5 IU/kg or the ITI dose) to 
assess the success of ITI. FVIII half -life will be assessed once a subject has 2 negative inhibitor 
titers within a two-month period and 2 FVIII IRs ≥66% of the initial baseline I R value in Part A 
within a two- month period, after a wash -out period of at least 84 -96 hours. If IR is ≥66% but 
half-life is <6 hours, half -life determination will be repeated at intervals no greater than monthly . 
When I R is ≥66% of initial value and FVIII half -life ≥6 hours, ITI will be considered successful. 
[IP_ADDRESS] BAX 855 Individualized Prophylaxis Dosing
The proph ylaxis dosing is at a dose of 25to 50 IU/kg at least once weekl y, up to 80 IU/kg, at the 
discretion of the investigator. Prophy laxis with [ADDRESS_1265525].
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Recommendations for BAX 855 Dose and/or Frequency Adjustments
Subjects meeting an y of the following criteria may have their BAX 855 dosage and/or infusion 
frequency  increased:
Two or more spontaneous (not trauma- related) bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_902263]- month period 
One or more spontaneous (not trauma
-related) bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_11630] a non- target joint 
within any  two- month period
The BAX 855 dosage may  be increased graduall y up to a maximum of 80 ± 5 IU/kg and/or the 
dosing frequency  may  be increased, if the subject continues to experience spontaneous 
breakthrough bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_902264], in judgment of the investigator, the subject’s IR warrants 
higher doses. Doses as high as 80 IU/kg may  be used provided the FVIII peak level does not 
exceed 200%. Otherwise, the frequency  of prophy lactic infusions has to be increased. The dose 
of 80 IU/kg is based on experience with ADVATE. Safet y of PK doses of BAX 855 up to 
60IU/kg were evaluated in a Phase 1 study  of BAX 855 (Study  261101) and in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_61493] 2/3 study  (Study 261201).

Additionally, subjects with severe hemophilic arthropathy and/or target joints who continue to 
experience recurrent bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_902265]/or dosing frequency, an ultrasound of the affected joint(s) should be performed to verify the presence of a bleed.

period .32For definitions of joint and muscle bleeding, see Section 20.4.
[IP_ADDRESS] BAX 855 On-demand Dosing for Treatment of Bleeding Epi[INVESTIGATOR_902266] A: The on-demand treatment is at a dose of 10-80 IU/kg depending on the severity of the 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. On-demand therapy is only available for subjects up to the age of [ADDRESS_1265527] or their caregiver will rate the severity (mild, moderate, or severe) of the 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_279459] 24 ± 2 hours and at resolution of bleed. A 4-point efficacy rating scale (see Table 2 in Section 11.1.2)  will be used to assess the 
efficacy of BAX 855 treatment. Since efficacy rating is based to a large degree on cessation of pain, the investigator/legal representative shall, in particular in case of injury-related bleeding into one or more than one location, take the injury-related symptoms into consideration when performing the efficacy rating at resolution of the bleed.
As per Table 1,  multiple infusions of BAX 855 may be administered for the treatment of a 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The overall response to all infusions combined is the rating that will be recorded.
It is critical that treatment of a bleed is initiated as soon as possible after occurrence of the 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].
When bleeding is controlled, additional infusions of BAX 855 to maintain hemostasis are 
permitted, if required.yy

10.1 Informed Consent and Enrollment
Any patient, or their legal representatives, as required, who provides informed consent (ie, signs 
and dates the informed consent form and assent form, if applicable) is considered enrolled in the 
study .
10.[ADDRESS_1265542] Identification Code
The following series of numbers will comprise the SI C: protocol identifier (ie, 261203) to be 
provided b y the sponsor, 3- digit number study site number (eg, 002) to be provided b y the 
sponsor, and 3-digit subject number (eg, 003) reflecting the order of enrollment (ie, signing the 
informed consent form). For example, the third subject who signed an informed consent form at 
study  site [ADDRESS_1265543] 261203 -002003. All study  documents (eg, CRFs, 
clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability  logs, etc.) will be identified with 
the SI C. Additionally , a uniquely  coded SI C(s) is permitted as long as it does not contain a 
combination of information that allows identification of a subject (eg, collection of a subject’s 
initials and birth date would not be permitted), in compliance with laws governing data privacy.
10.3 Screening and Study Visits
The study  site is responsible for maintaining an enrollment/screening log that includes all 
subjects enrolled. The log also will serve to document the reason for scre ening failure. All 
screening data will be collected and reported in CRFs, regardless of screening outcome. 
Screening is defined as first blood draw, including laboratory  evaluations.
If a subject does not satisfy  all screening criteria, the same subject ma y be rescreened at a later 
date. A partial or full rescreening may  also become necessary  at the discretion of the investigator 
or sponsor. For the purpose of anal ysis, onl y the data from the most recent screening visit will be 
used for screening assessment s that were repeated during rescreening. If a subject is rescreened, 
the End of Study  CRF should be completed, and a new informed consent form, new SI
C and new 
CRF are required for that subject. Blood draws for laboratory  tests may  be staggered over the 
entire screening period of [ADDRESS_1265544], eg, FVIII activity , inhibitory  and 
binding antibodies to FVIII, PEG and BAX 855 (for further deta ils see laboratory  manual). If

A bleed is defined as subjective (eg , pain consistent with a joint bleed) or objective evidence of 
bleeding which may  or may  not require treatment with FVIII. For further definitions of bleeds 
see Supplement 21.1. Bleeds occurring at the same anatomical location (eg, right knee) with the 
same etiology  (ie, spontaneous vs. injury ) within [ADDRESS_1265555] bleed will be 
considered a single bleed.32A new bleed is defined as a bleed occurring >72 hours after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_902276] t.Bleeding occurring at multiple locations related to the same 
injury  (eg, knee and ankle bleeds following a fall) will be counted as a single bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].
Only  bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_902277] 855 will be evaluated for hemostatic efficacy  as 
descr ibed in the following sections, whereas bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_902278] 
B will not be evaluated for hemostatic efficacy .
11.1.1 Number of BAX 855 Infusions Needed for the Treatment of Bleeding Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] 
(Part A)
The number of BAX [ADDRESS_1265556], his/her caregiver, and/or clinician treating the subject, and is based upon the subject’s 
response to treatment, using the Efficacy  Rating Scale for Treatment of Bleeding Epi[INVESTIGATOR_279463] 2. An infusion is defined as completion of administration of the calculated dose of 
BAX 855. If an infusion is interrupted, eg, due to vascular access is sues, and must be re -started, 
it will be recorded as 1 infusion. If an infusion is terminated for an y reason prior to completion 
of infusion and not restarted, it will be recorded as an infusion; reasons for not completing the 
infusion will be recorded.
11.1.2 Hemostatic Efficacy Rating for Treatment of Bleeding Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (Part A)
The subject or their caregiver will rate the severit
y (minor, moderate, or major/life -threatening) 
of the bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_279459] 24 ± 2hours aft er the 
initiation of treatment, and at bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_902279], using a 4 -point efficacy  rating scale 
(Table 2). Since the efficacy  rating is base d to a large degree on cessation of pain, the 
investigator/subject shall, in particular in case of injury -related bleeding into one or more than 
one location, consider the injury -
related s ymptoms when performing the efficacy  rating 24 hours 
after initiatin g treatment and at resolution of bleed.

 As per Table 2, multiple infusions of BAX 855 may  be administered for the treatment of a 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The overall response to all infusions combined is the rating that will be 
recorded.

additional infusion isrequired forthecontrol ofbleeding. Administration of further infusions to
maintain hemostasis wouldnotaffect thisscoring.
Good Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion. Possibly 
requires more than 1 infusion for complete resolution.
Fair Probable and/or slight relief of pain and slight improvement in signs of bleeding after a single 
infusion. Required more than 1 infusion for complete resolution.
None No impro vement or condition worsens.
Details pertaining to all treatments for each bleed, including response to treatment, will be 
recorded b y stud y subjects/subjects’ caregiver in subject diaries provided by [CONTACT_47662]’s representative. At each stud y visit, the investigator will review together with the 
subject/subject’s caregiver the response to treatment and evaluate the hemostatic efficacy  rating. 
It may  become necessary to re -discuss the rating with the subject/subject’s caregiver to ensure 
the Ra ting Scale is full y understood. The investigator will either confirm the efficacy  rating or 
record an updated efficacy rating with appropriate source documentation justify ing the change:
Any inconsistency  between the efficacy  rating and the number of infus ions used to treat a 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], or a response to treatment rated as “none” must be immediately  
clarified.
If 2 or more responses to treatment of unique bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_279461] “fair”, the 
investigator may  re-evaluate the dosing regimen and the t ime from bleeding onset to the 
start of treatment. If a bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_902281]  1 infusion but response to treatment 
is rated “fair”, the rating should be evaluated and the Rating Scale should be reviewed 
with the subject/subject’s caregiver.
If mor e than 1 infusion was given to treat a bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], and the treatment was rated 
“excellent”, additional information should be provided about the severity  of the bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (see Table 1) and/or whether additional infusions were given to maintain 
hemostasis.
If infusions were given to maintain hemostasis after resolution of bleed, this should be recorded 
adequatel y in the subject’s electronic diary  and integrated in the eCRF.

11.4 ITI Therapy (Part B)
11.4.1 Definition of Success, Partial Success and Failure
Success is defined as 1) a persistently  negative inhibitor titer <0.6 BU, 2) FVIII IR ≥66% of the 
baseline value following a wash -out period of 84- 96 h, and 3) a FVIII half -life of ≥[ADDRESS_1265563], including maintenance of FVIII levels above 1%.
Partial success is defined after [ADDRESS_1265564] be met: 1) 
inhibitor titer <0.6 BU (confirmed by  a central laboratory  with a second blood specimen obtained 
within 2 months), 2) FVIII in vivo recovery  ≥66% of baseline value (confirmed within a two -
month p eriod), and 3) FVIII half -life 
≥6 hours. If no baseline IR is available, the I R value is 
indicative of an adequate clinical response following a wash -out period of 84 -96h. An adequate 
clinical response is defined as pharmacokinetic parameters that permit effective prophy lactic 
treatment of the stud y, including maintenance of FVIII levels above 1%.
Failure is defined as the failure to meet the criteria for success or partial success within 
33months of I TI therap y OR less than 20% reduction in inhibitor tit er, relative to the peak 
inhibitor titer, over an y six -month period after the first 3 months of treatment (in the absence of 
infection which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_902271]).

unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom (eg, rash, pain, 
discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.), disease (eg, peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.), or outcome of death 
temporally  associated with the use of an I P, whether or not considered causally  related to the IP.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose 
meets one or more of the following criteria:
Outcome is fatal/results in death (including fetal death)
Is life -threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment of the 
investigator, at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death had it been more severe.
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1666] 
–inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_902282] y inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay .
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (ie, a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability  to conduct normal life functions)
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Is a medicall y important event –a medical event that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_902283]. Examples of such events are:
Development of a confirmed inhibitory  antibody  based on a second blood draw to 
FVIII within 2 weeks of study  site notification of an inhibitor determined at the 
central laboratory  with an inhibitor level ≥0.6 BU/mL  using the N ijmegen 
modification of the Bethesda assay
Intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dy scrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
development of drug dependence or drug abuse

 Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for human immunodeficiency  virus 
(HIV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), 
hepatitis E virus (HEV), or parvovirus B19 (B19V)
Thromboembolic events (e.g., stroke, m yocardial infarction, deep v ein thrombosis, 
pulmonary  embolism)
For the purpose of this study :
Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54692] a planned surgical intervention or the placement or 
planned removal of a CVD is not considered an SAE. However, an y planned 
surgery  becoming necessary  due to a worsening condition of the subject during the 
study  period constitutes an SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Serious Adverse Event
A non-serious AE is an AE that does not meet the criteria of an SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected Adverse Events
An unexpected adverse event is an AE whose nature, sever ity, specificit y, or outcome is not 
consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the Reference Safet y Information 
(eg, IB, package insert). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are mentioned in the IB as 
occurring with a class of dr ugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, 
but are not specificall y mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.
For the purposes of this study , all AEs, including unexpected AEs, experienced by  a subject
undergoing study -related procedure(s) will be recorded on the AE CRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Diseases
Preexisting diseases that are present before entry  in to the study  are described in the medical 
history , and those that manifest with the same severity , frequency , or duration after IP exposure, 
will not be recorded as AEs. However, when there is an increase in the severity , duration, or 
frequency  of a preexisting disease, the event must be described on the AE CRF.
12.1.[ADDRESS_1265566] I P 
exposure will not be considered AEs, and thus, not included in the anal ysis of AEs:

described on the AE CRF using the medical diagnosis (preferred), or, if no diagnosis could be 
established at the time of reporting the AE, a symptom or sign, in standard medical terminology  
in order to avoid the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions (see definition in 
Section 12.1). Each AE will be evaluated b y the investigator for:
Seriousness as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
Severity  as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
Causal relationship to I P exposure or study  procedure as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
For each AE, the outcome (ie, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, recovered/resolved with 
sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal, unknown) and if applicable action taken (ie, dose 
increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug interrupted, drug withdrawn, not applicable, or 
unknown) will also be recorded on the AE CRF. Recovering/resolving AEs will be followed 
until the study  Completion/ Termination Visit; the follow -up information will be documented in 
the CRF. If the severit y rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original 
AE report will be revised (ie, the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the course of 
any AE, the highest severity  rating will be reported.
Deviations from the protocol- specified dosage (including overdosing [exceeds maximum 
recommended dose b y 20%], underdosing [ ˃10% below the minimum recommended dose], 
abuse, and withdrawal, treatment errors (including incorrect route of a dministration, use of an 
incorrect product, and deviations from the protocol -defined dosing schedule), failures of 
expected pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be 
followed with regard to occurrence of AEs, lack of efficacy , and/or other observations because 
these events may  be reportable to regulatory  authorities.
If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE occurring in a subject after study completion, the 
SAE must be reported on the SAE Form within 24 hours after a wareness; no additional reporting 
on CRFs is necessary .
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity
The investigator will assess the severity of each AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment 
based on the most appropriate description below:
Mild
The AE is a transient discomfort and d oes not interfere in a significant manner with 
the subject’s normal functioning level.
The AE resolves spontaneously  or may  require minimal therapeutic intervention.
For non-commercial use only
[COMPANY_005] CONFIDENTIAL Page 61
PEGylated full -length recombinant factor VIII
Adynovate 261203 Protocol Amendment 8 (Global) 21 Jun 2021
 Moderate
The AE produces limited impairment of function and may  require therapeutic 
intervention.
The AE produces no sequela/sequelae.
Severe
The AE results in a marked impairment of function and may  lead to temporary  
inability  to resume usual life pattern.
The AE produces sequela/sequelae, which require (prolonged) therapeutic 
intervention.
These severity  definitions will also be used to assess the severity of an AE with a study- related 
procedure(s), if necessary.
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality
Causality  is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility  that the I P is 
etiologicall y related to/associat ed with the AE. Causality  assessment includes, eg, assessment of 
temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association (or lack of association) 
with underly ing disease, presence (or absence) of a more likel y cause, and physiological 
plausibility . For each AE, the investigator will assess the causal relationship between the IP and 
the AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment according to the following most appropriate 
algorithm for the circumstances of the AE:
Not related (both circumstances must be met)
Is due to underl ying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent treatments, or 
effects of concurrent drugs
Is not associated with the IP (ie, does not follow a reasonable temporal relationship 
to the administration of IP or has a much more likely  alternative etiology ). 
Unlikely  related (either 1 or both circumstances are met)
Has little or no temporal relationship to the I P 
A more likely  alternative etiology  exists
Possibly  related (both circumstances must be met)
Follows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of I P
An alternative etiology  is equally  or less likely  compared to the potential 
relationship to the I P

 Probably  related (both circumstances must be met)
Follows a strong temporal relationship to the administration of I P, which may  
include but is not limited to the following: 
oReappearance of a similar reaction upon re -administration (positive 
rechallenge)
oPositive results in a drug sensitivity  test (skin test, etc.)
oToxic level of the I P as evidence d by [CONTACT_279525] I P concentrations in 
the blood or other bodily  fluid
Another etiology  is unlikely  or significantly  less likely
For events assessed as not related or unlikel y related and occurring within 96 h after IP infusion, 
the investigator shal
l provide the alternative etiology . These causality  definitions will also be 
used to assess the relationship of an AE with a study -related procedure(s), if necessary .

 [IP_ADDRESS] Incremental Recovery
The FVIII assay s are: one -stage clotting FVIII activity  and FVIII chromogenic activity .
In Part A, BAX 855 is administered for the determination of FVIII IR at the study site at baseline 
and every  study  visit other than study visits 5 ±1 EDs, 15 ±1 EDs and 30 ± 3EDs, when IR 
determination is optional. If the subject has received an infusion of a FVIII product prior to 
baseline, there must be a minimum wash-out of at le ast [ADDRESS_1265577] BAX 855 infusion. A pre -infusion 
blood sample is drawn within 30 minutes before the infusion , then 50 ± 5IU/kg of BAX 855 is 
infused, followed b y a pos t-infusion blood- draw at 15-30 minutes. I n case of low dose 
prophy lactic treatment or on -demand treatment, a lower dose for IR determination may  be 
considered but should not be lower than 25 IU/kg.
In Part B, IR is assessed once a subject has 2 negative inhibitor titers within a two -month period 
(minimum 3 weeks apart) and will be repeated until I R is ≥66% of the initial baseline I R value in 
Part A. The IR should be performed after the longest time interval possible (preferabl y 48 hours) 
without undue inter ruption to the I TI therapy  schedule. The dose for IR determination in Part B 
is 50 ±5 IU/kg, however, in order to avoid undue interruption of ITI therapy , the same ITI dose 
may be used for IR determination. I f the IR is ≥66% of the initial baseline value, ITI should be 
continued and IR determination with BAX [ADDRESS_1265578] time interval possible without undue interruption to the I TI 
therap y schedule. If IR is again ≥66% of initial val ue, ITI therap y will be continued and a FVIII 
half-life determination performed within [ADDRESS_1265579] 
84-96 hours. When I R is ≥66% of initial value and FVIII half -life ≥6 hours, I TI 
willbe considered successful. 
Once succ ess is confirmed, the high- dose ITI with BAX 855 will be gradually  reduced over a 
2-3-month period to a twice weekly  prophy laxis as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] BAX [ADDRESS_1265580] experiences a confirmed increase in FVIII inhibitor titer (>0.6 BU)

 described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] BAX 855 ITI followed by  [CONTACT_902339]/Termination Visit 
after a three -month follow -up period with twice weekl y proph ylaxis has been completed. 
If the FVIII inhibitor titer remains >0.6 BU and/o r IR <66% after 2 months of receiving 
the higher dose/frequency , then the subject should continue with the same dose/frequency  
level for an additional 2 months.
The above process can be repeated one more time. If FVIII inhibitor and FVIII IR both 
are norma lized, the same procedures and dose reduction schedule as described above 
apply .
If the FVIII inhibitor titer continues to be >0.6 BU and/or IR <66%, there are 2 options:
A Completion/Termination Visit is performed. 
The subject can be switched to a low do se IT I therap y consisting of 50 IU/kg 
3times weekly  for [ADDRESS_1265583] should proceed to twice weekl y proph ylaxisfor 3 months 
followed b y the Completion/Termination Visit. I f either FVIII inhibitors or FVIII 
IR is not normalized after 3 months of low dose ITI  therapy , a 
Completion/Termination Visit should be performed. 
If the BAX 855 IR is <66% of the initial value , ITI therap y should be continued and BAX [ADDRESS_1265584] time interval possible (preferabl y 48 hours), however, 
without undue interruption to the I TI therapy  schedule until BAX 855 IR is ≥66% of initial 
value. ITI should be conti nued and IR with BAX [ADDRESS_1265585] time interval possible without undue interruption to the 
ITI therap y schedule. If IR is again ≥66% of initial value, ITI therapy  will be continued and a 
FVIII half -life determination performed within [ADDRESS_1265586] 
84-96 h. When I R remains ≥66% of initial value and FVIII half - life is ≥6 hours, ITI will be 
considered successful and the high -dose of BAX 855 will be gradual ly reduced over a 2-3- month 
period to a twice weekl y prophy laxis as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] BAX 855 I TI. After a 
further three -month follow -up period with twice weekl y proph ylaxis, a Completion/Termination 
Visit will be performed. For low -dose ITI, once success criteria have been met, the prophy lactic 
regimen will be transitioned as in Section [IP_ADDRESS] BAX 855 ITI.
If FV III half -life is <6 hours, ITI will be continued and I R and half -life repeated monthly . If 
FVIII half -
life remains <6 hours and/or IR remains <66% of initial value, these asse ssments 
should be repeated monthly  until a maximum of 33 months of I TI has been provided and the 
Completion/Termination Visit will be performed.

 In case no initial baseline I R of Part A is available, the same procedures as described above 
should be perform ed. The baseline IR value of 66% is replaced by  [CONTACT_902340], including maintenance of FVIII levels above 1%. 
[IP_ADDRESS] FVIII Half -life
The abbreviated PK to determine FVIII half-life is an optional assessment that can be performed 
at baseline, Visit 1, or Visit 2. The dosing for this PK is the same as the dosing for IR assessment 
consisting of 50 ± 5IU/kg. If the subject has received an infusion of a FVIII product prior to 
baseline there must be a minimum wash -out of at least 72 hours. A blood sample will be drawn 
within 30 ± 5minutes before, and [ADDRESS_1265587] -infusion blood draw for the 
determination of the initial FVIII recovery  will be taken for the Baseline Visit.
In Part B, FVIII half -life is determined to assess the success of ITI. FVIII half -life will 
beassessed with a dose of 50 ± 5 IU/kg or the current prophy lactic dose, once a subject has had 
2 negative inhibitor titers within a two-month period and 2 IRs ≥66% of the initial baseline I R 
value in Part A within [ADDRESS_1265588] 84 -96hours. When I R is ≥66% of the initial value and FVIII half- life ≥6 hours, 
ITI will be considered successful (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). If the 2 IRs are >66% but FVIII half -life 
is <[ADDRESS_1265589] of complete blood count [hemoglobin, hematocrit,

12.7.5 Assessment of Laboratory Values
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Abnormal Laboratory Values 
The investigator’s assessment of each laboratory value will be recorded on the eCRF. For each 
abnormal laboratory  value, the investigator will determine whether the value is considered clinically  
significant or not. For clinically  significant va lues, the investigator will indicate if the value 
constitutes a new AE (see definition in Section 12.1, and record the sign, sy mptom, or medical 
diagnosis on the AE CRF), is a sy mptom or related to a previously  recorded AE, is due to a pre-
existing disease (described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), or is due to another issue that will be specified. If the 
abnormal value was not clinically  significant, the investigator will indicate the reason, ie because it is 
due to a preexisting disease, due to a lab error, or due to another issue that will be specified .

Backup samples for testing of inhibitory  antibodies to FVIII and binding IgG and IgM 
antibodies to FVIII, PEG -FVIII, and PEG.
Optional backup samples for FVIII testing will be taken at each stud y visit.
Backup samples that remain after stud y testing is done may be stored and used for additional 
testing (eg, further evaluation of an abnormal test or an AE) and further assay  optimization. 
Samples will be stored in a coded form for no more than 2 years after the final study report has
been completed and then the samples will subsequently  be destroy ed.
12.8 Vital Signs
Vital signs will include body  temperature (°C or °F), respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842] (breaths/min), pulse rate 
(beats/min), and s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg). Height (in or cm) will be 
collected at Screening and weight (lb or kg) will also be collected at Screening and at all 
pre-infusion assessments. Also, height will be measured every  6 months. 
Vital signs will be measured at screening and within 15 minutes before and 15 to 30minutes 
after administration of I P, at each study  visit except for Visits 1, 3 and 5 (ie, at Baseline Visit, 
Visit 2 after 10 ± 1 EDs, Visit 4 after 20 ± 2 EDs, Visit 6 after 40 ±3 EDs, Visit 7 at 50 -55EDs, 
and Visit 8 at 75 ± 5 EDs) , and at stud y Co mpletion/Termination at 100- 110EDs. Blood 
pressure will be measured when subjects are in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].
Vital sign values are to be recorded on the CRF. For each abnormal vital sign value, the 
investigator will determine whether or not to report an AE (see definition in Section 12.[ADDRESS_1265591] the medical diagnosis (preferabl y), symptom, or sign on the AE CRF). Additional tests 
and other evalua tions required to establish the significance or etiology  of an abnormal value, or 
to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinicall y indicated. An y abnormal 
value that persists should be followed at the discretion of the investigator.

 The sponsor will provide to the investigator in written form an y new information that 
significantl y bears on the subjects’ risks associated with I P exposure. The informed consent will 
be updated, if necessary . This new information and/or revised informed consent form, that have 
been approved b y the applicable EC and regulatory authorities, where applicable, will be 
provided b y the investigator to the subjects who consented to participate in the study (see 
Section 16.3).
16.4 Data Monitoring Committee
This study  will be monitored by  a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). The DMC is a group of 
individuals with pertinent expertise that reviews on a regular basis accumulating data from an 
ongoing clinical stud y. For this study, the DMC will be composed of recognized expe
rts in the 
field of hemophilia clinical care and research who are not actively  recruiting subjects. The DMC 
can stop a trial if it finds toxicities or if treatment is proven to be not beneficial.
The sponsor will formally  convene this panel for review of t he stud y data at least once per year 
until completion of the study . Ad hoc convocations of the DMC will occur on an as- needed 
basis. If the inhibitor incidence is above 41% of the total study  cohort (the 95% confidence 
interval upper limit of that observed in the ADVATE PUP study ) after at least the first 
10
subjects are enrolled, then the data will be presented to the DMC for review.

 20.2.2 Detailed Flow Diagram of Study Procedures for Part B
If during Part B:
a subject has a severe h ypersensitivity  reaction, an additional blood sample has to be 
drawn to test for the presence of IgE antibodies against FVIII and PEG.
a subject must undergo a surgical intervention, there are no protocol -defined treatment 
regimens, but the use of any  by[CONTACT_902347]. 
a subject does not initiate I TI within the first month, FVIII and immunogenicity  labs 
should be assessed monthly  until ITI initiation
after the first [ADDRESS_1265647] a 20% reduction in inhibitor 
titer relative to the peak inhibitor titer over an y six -month period (in the absence of 
infection which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_902295] d to result in elevated 
inhibitor titers), I TI therapy  will be considered a failure and a Completion/Termination 
Visit should be performed at a time deemed feasible by  [CONTACT_86206].
In order to ensure timel y availability  of FVIII inhibitor results enabling the clinical management 
of the subject, results of the local laboratory  may  be used. However, if ITI has been initiated 
based on results of the local laboratory and a FVIII inhibitor is not confirmed by  [CONTACT_902348] [ADDRESS_1265648] will be transitioned back to Part A.

k.BAX 855 is administered at the study site at baseline and every study visit other than study Visits 1 (5 ±1 EDs), 3 (15 ± 1EDs) and 5 (30 ±3 EDs) for the 
determination of factor VIII (FVIII) incremental recovery (IR) and abbreviated pharmacokinetics (PK) at baseline, Visit 1, or Visit 2, if performed 
(optional). If the subject has received an infusion of a FVIII product prio r to baseline there must be a minimum wash -out of at least [ADDRESS_1265666]’s prophylactic treatment regimen, if applicable. For IR determination, a dose of 50 ± 5 IU/kg 
BAX 855 should be infused. In case of on -demand therapy or low  dose prophylactic treatment, a low er dose for IR determination may be considered but 
should not be low er than 25 IU/kg BAX 855. Also, at baseline, Visit 1, or Visit 2 an optional half -life based on an abbreviated PK can be performed 
following a dose of 50 ± 5 IU/kg BAX 855. For this purpose, an additional blood sample shoul d be draw n 24-[ADDRESS_1265667] the next scheduled visit, or as appropriate.

a.In order to minimize the amount of blood to be drawn at a specific study visit, the required tests can be performed over a co uple of days, however, for the 
determination of immunogenicity and incremental recovery (IR), the respective wash -out periods have to be considered.
b.These visits should take place at the exposure days (EDs) shown or after [ADDRESS_1265668] (IP) refer to 
Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_1265669]. Hem atology assessments include: hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
red blood cell count, and white blood cell count with differential (ie, basophils, eosinophils, lym phocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils), mean corpuscular 
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and platelet count. In the event of surgery, local hematology results, if any, should be 
recorded.
e.Clinical chemistry assessments include: sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, total protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose. In the eve nt of surgery, lo cal chemistry 
results, if any, should be recorded.
f.CD4 count is analyzed to determine subject’s eligibility, thereafter every year.
g.If results of factor VIII (FVIII) gene mutation analysis and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype are already available at the study site, they will be 
provided to the sponsor and an additional analysis will not be required.
h.Factor VIII assays include: FVIII one -stage clotting activity and FVIII chromogenic activity. If the subject has received an infusion of a FVIII product prior 
to baseline there must be a minimum wash -out of at least [ADDRESS_1265670]

IR and half -life, if available, and the required FVIII target levels.
The required units will be calculated according to the following f ormula:
Required units (IU) =
body weight (kg) x desired FVIII rise (IU/dL) x reciprocal of IR (IU/kg)/(IU/dL)
Example: I n case of an IR of 2.0 [I U/dL ]/[IU/kg], the required units would be calculated using 
the following formula:
body weight (kg) x desired FVIII rise (IU/dL) x 0.5 (IU/kg)/(IU/dL)
If at an y time during the study , a subject does not respond to BAX [ADDRESS_1265688] antifibri nolytic 
therap y such as e.g. tranexamic acid is allowed if clinically indicated b y the investigator and/or 
according to the standard of care of the subject ’s institution.
For the clinical management of the subject during the perioperative period, the local laboratory  
can be used. Additional blood draws for testing at the central laboratory  are optional in order to 
minimize the amount of blood to be drawn.
Surgical hemostatic efficacy  is to be determined per (Section 11.3, Table 3, Table 4, and 
Table 5). 
22.[ADDRESS_1265689] will receive a loading dose calculated according to the formula described above in 
order to maintain a minimum target FVIII level as required b y the category and t ype of surgery . 
The recommended loading dose will be calculated by  [CONTACT_093]. The initial loading dose 
will be administered within 60 minutes prior to surgery  (prior to incision/intubation). Vials of 
varying potencies may  be used to ensure adequate dosing. A blood sample for post infusion 
FVIII at 15 ± [ADDRESS_1265690] been obtained.

 Also, pre -infusion blood sample may  be drawn within 30 minutes prior to the loading dose. 
Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) will also be det ermined from the post infusion 
blood sample. 
In case of major surgery , FVIII target levels should be 80-100% of normal, in case of minor 
surgery  FVIII levels should be at 30- 60%.
If the FVIII activity  results are not available within a reasonable time period prior to the start of 
surgery , at least the post -infusion value of the aPTT must be obtained. The FVIII activity  level 
following the loading dose must be obtained within [ADDRESS_1265691] be performed as needed.
The surgery may only start after normalization of the aPTT.
If the aPTT is not normalized or the desired FVIII activity  is not attained, a supplemental loading 
dose(s) of BAX [ADDRESS_1265692] 
been determined.
Note:
Whenever poss ible, a second FVIII activity  level should be determined within preferabl y 6-[ADDRESS_1265693], with dose adjustments as necessary  on the 
day of surgery .
If possible, ALL subsequent infusions of BAX 855 should be pre ceded b y measurement of 
residual FVIII levels and the dose adjusted as needed. Dosing adjustments based on aPTT values 
are not allowed. Based on each individual PK parameters, ie, IR and half -life, if available, it is 
recommended that the following FVIII t rough levels should be targeted for major surgery :
The first postoperative 72 hours (Day  1-Day 3): ≥80%
Postoperative Day  4 –Day 7: ≥50% (if not y et discharged)

 Postoperative Day  8 to discharge (if not y et discharged): it is recommended that the FVIII 
levels should not fall below 30% (left to the discretion of the investigator depending on 
the postoperative course)
General postoperative treatment recommendations:
Treatment intervals should be tailored in order not to exceed supraph ysiological peak 
FVIII levels of 180%. Therefore, the dose should be administered in 
1-3infusions over [ADDRESS_1265694] commonly  in 2 infusions.
The dose may  be increased to a maximum of 100 IU/kg, however, the peak level should 
not exceed 180%.
Beginning postoperative Day  1 (ie, the day  following the day  of surgery ) through discharge, 
subjects will have a BAX 855 pre -infusion (within 30 minutes) and after 
15±[ADDRESS_1265695] be drawn prior to a ny

Section 9.2 Exclusion Criteria
Description of Change: Substitution of the word “plasma” for “FFP”. 
Reason for Change : Per regulations, FFP is one specific type of plasma 
preparation. The intent is to allow transfusion of all ty pes of plasma components, 
so the term “plasma” is used to more accurately  indicate the intent of the protocol. 
3.Synopsis, Subject Selection, Exclusion Criteria
Section 9.2 Exclusion Criteria
Description of Change: Limiting the total number of A DVATE exposures to 2 
EDs total, including prior to enrollment and during the screening period.
Reason for Change : ADVATE is permitted during the screening period, but no 
maximum number of exposu res was provided. The addition of an explicit limit of 
ADVATE exposures adds clarity  to the subject selection criteria.

Description of Change : The ITI failure definit ion is updated to be conditional on 
the absence of an infection that could explain a failure of inhibitory  titers to 
decrease, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].
Reason for Change : Recent infection is known to boost inhibitory  titers, 
independent of the e ffect of ITI. Thus, an ITI course could be deemed a failure for 
a reason that does not reflect the tolerizing effect of ITI. This change gives 
investigators the discretion to continue ITI if they deem an infectious cause to be 
responsible for a failure of inhibitory  titers to decrease.
5.Section 8.3 Duration of Study Period(s) and Subject Participation

Descripti on of Change: The definitions of ITI success, partial success and failure 
were revised as follows: 
Success is defined as 1) a persistently  negative inhibitor titer < 0.6 BU 2) a FVIII 
IR≥ 66% of baseline value following a wash -out period of 84 -96 hours a nd 3) a 
FVIII half -life of ≥ 6 hours. If no baseline IR is available, the IR value is indicative 
of an adequate clinical response following a wash -out period of 84 -96 hours. An 
adequate clinical response is defined as pharmacokinetic parameters that permit
effective proph ylactic treatment of the study , including maintenance of FVIII levels 
above1%. 
Partial success is defined after [ADDRESS_1265720] be met: 1) I nhibitor titer < 0.6 BU (confirmed by a central laboratory  with a 
second blood specimen obtained within 2 months) 2) FVIII IR ≥ 66% (confirmed 
within a 2-month period) and 3) FVIII half- life ≥6 hours. If no baseline IR is 
available, the IR value is indicative of an adequate clinical response following a 
wash -out peri od of 84 -96 hours. 
An adequate clinical response is defined as, 
pharmacokinetic parameters that permit effective prophylactic treatment of the 
study , including maintenance of FVIII levels above1%.
Failure is defined as the failure to meet the criteria for success or partial success 
within 33 months of I TI therapy  OR less than 20% reduction in inhibitor titer, over 
any 6-month period after the first 3 months of treatment. Subjects who meet failure 
criteria, i.e decline in the inhibitor titer of < 20% in any 6- month period after the 
first [ADDRESS_1265721] their ITI therap y discontinued.

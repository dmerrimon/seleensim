Title of Study: A Phase 1 -2, Dose -Escalating, 6 -Part Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Doses of AT -007 in Healthy Adult Subjects and Adult 
Subjects with Classic Galactosemia (CG) or GALK -deficient Galactosemia  
Study Center: The study will be conducted at up to 6  sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and up to 3 sites 
in Europe.  
Phase of Development:  1-2 
Study Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the safety of single and multiple ascending doses of orally administered 
AT-007 in healthy adult subjects a nd adult subjects with CG or  GALK -deficient 
Galactosemia  
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of single and multiple doses of orally 
administered AT -007 in healthy adult subjects and adult subjects with CG or  GALK -
deficient Galactose mia 
• To evaluate the effect of single and multiple doses of orally administered AT -007 on the 
level of galactitol, a biomarker of aldose reductase (AR) activity, in adult subjects with CG 
or GALK -deficient Galactosemia  
• To evaluate the effect of single and m ultiple doses of orally administered AT -007 on the 
levels of galactose and its other metabolites in adult subjects with CG or  GALK -deficient 
Galactosemia  
Exploratory:  
• To measure the levels of AT -007 in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) of healthy adult subjects   
Study Design:  
This study is a first -in-human, randomized, placebo -controlled, 6 -Part, single ascending dose (SAD) 
and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in healthy adult subjects and adult subjects with CG  or 
GALK -deficient Galactosemia. The s tudy is designed to assess the safety and PK of AT -[ADDRESS_862188] of AT -007 on 
biomarkers of galactose metabolism (galactose, galactitol, and other galactose metabolites) in  subjects 
with CG  or GALK -deficient Galactosemia.  
This study consists of 6 parts:  
• Part A (SAD) in 40 healthy subjects: 5 double -blind cohorts of 8 subjects (6 active and 2 
placebo) each  
• Part B (MAD for 7 days) in 28 healthy subjects: 2 double -blind cohort s of 8 subjects (6 active 
and 2  placebo) each and 2 double -blind cohorts of 6 subjects (4 active and 2 placebo) each  
• Part C (MAD for 7 days) in 12 healthy subjects: 3 cohorts of 4 subjects each (open -label 
AT-007)

Page 4 of 120 • Part D (SAD followed by 5 -day washout foll owed by [CONTACT_644162] 27 days in up to 18 subjects 
with CG: 3 cohorts of 6 subjects (4  active and 2  placebo) each (the clinical site staff and the 
subjects will be blinded to study treatment).  
• Part E (SAD followed by 5 -day washout followed by [CONTACT_644162] 27 days) in up to 18 subjects 
with GALK -deficient Galactosemia: 1 to 3 cohorts of 6 subjects (4  active and 2  placebo) each 
(the clinical site staff and the subjects will be blinded to study treatment)  
• Part D Extension for 90 days in up to 28 subjects (up to 21 active and 7 placebo) with CG in up 
to 2 cohorts (the clinical site staff and the subjects will be blinded to study treatment)  
Note: In Parts D and E, overall number of subjects per cohort may be increased up to [ADDRESS_862189] -to-follow -up among subjects treated with either placebo or AT -007. 
For all cohorts in all parts (A, B, C, D, and E), the study consists of a Screening Period (28  days 
[Day -28 to Day -1] for Parts A, B, and C and 40 days [Day -40 to Day -1] for Parts D  and E [and 
D Extension for de novo subjects who did not participate in Part D  and subjects whose last visit in 
Part D was > 60 days before Day 1 in the Part D Extension ]), a period of study treatment and associated 
assessments, and an end of study (EOS) or end of extension (EOE) Visit ([ADDRESS_862190] dose of 
study drug). Subjects will be randomized and receive the first dose of study drug on Day 1. At a 
minimum, subjects will remain at the clinical research unit (CRU) through [ADDRESS_862191] doses taken at home. Safety will be 
monitored and blood samples will be collected for PK in all parts of the study. Also, subjects in 
selected dose cohorts of Parts A (SAD) and D (SAD portion only) will have urine collected for PK. In 
additio n, subjects in Part C will have one lumbar puncture for CSF collection. Also, subjects in Parts D 
and E will have blood samples and urine collected for biomarkers of galactose metabolism.  
The 90 -day Part D Extension (separate informed consent required) is  open for subjects with CG who 
completed Part D, participated in but did not complete Part D for reasons other than study drug related 
treatment emergent adverse event (related TEAE), or did not participate in Part D. Subjects who 
previously completed Part  D may participate in the 90 -day Extension at any time after the EOS Visit 
(scheduled for [ADDRESS_862192] dose in Part D MAD). Subjects who participated in but did not 
complete Part D may participate in the Extension after either the EOS Visit (if t hey have this visit and 
it occurs beyond [ADDRESS_862193] dose) or a minimum [ADDRESS_862194] dose 
received in Part D  (if they do not have the EOS Visit or have it before [ADDRESS_862195] dose) . 
Subjects with CG who have no t previously participated in Part D may be prescreened (optional) and 
participate in the [ADDRESS_862196] visit in Part D more than 60 days before Day 1 in Part D 
Extension will also need a screening visit although some screening procedures done before Part D do 
not need to be repeated. Subjects in the Part D Extension will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to active 
drug at the daily dose of 20 mg/kg or placebo. Most doses during the Part D Extension will be taken at 
home , but there are 2  in-clinic stay s. A second cohort may be initiated in the Part D Extension to 
evaluate a dose higher than 20 mg/kg/day. If so, subjects will be randomized in a 3:[ADDRESS_862197] blood samples collected for both PK and biomarkers of galactose metabolism . 
The starting dose in Part A was 0.5 mg/kg as a single dose. Subsequent doses in Part A and all doses in 
Parts B, C, D, and E are based on the results of previous cohorts and/or previous parts of the study. 
Part A of the study started first. Part A Cohort 5  (40 mg/kg single dose) was recently added  to the 
protocol  (version 4.0)  and results showed the dose was safe and well tolerated . Part B started after all 
subjects in Cohorts A1 through A4 completed the study (minus the EOS Visit). Given that the results 
for 40 mg/kg in Cohort A5 were acceptable, Part B Cohort 4 ( 40 mg/kg ) will start with this version of 
the protocol (version 5.0) . The first cohort in Part C (C1) started after both safety and PK data from 
Protocol AT -007-1001 V ersion 10.0 
Applied Therapeutics Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  3 September  2021 
Page 5 of 120 Cohorts B1 and B2 were reviewed. Cohort C1 was condu cted simultaneously with Cohort B3 and used 
the same dose as Cohort B2  (10 mg/kg) . The second cohort in Part C (C2) started after safety and PK 
data from Cohort B3 were reviewed and used the same dose as Cohort B3  (20 mg/kg) ; safety and PK 
results for Coho rt C1 were also considered before starting Cohort C2. The third cohort in Part C (C3) 
will start with this version of the protocol (version 5.0)  and use the same dose as Cohort  B4 (given the 
results from Cohort A5 ); safety and PK results for Cohort  C2 were  also considered before starting 
Cohort C3. The first cohort in Part D (D1) started after all subjects in Cohorts A1 through A4 
completed the study including the EOS Visit and all subjects in Cohorts B1 and B2 completed the 
study (minus the EOS Visit). The  dose for Cohort D1 (5  mg/kg) was not higher than the dose for 
Cohort B2  (10 mg/kg) . The second cohort in Part D (D2) started after all subjects in Cohort B3 
completed the study (minus the EOS Visit) and the dose level (20 mg/kg) was the same as  that for 
Cohort B3. The third cohort in Part  D (D3) will start after all subjects in Cohort  B4 complete the study 
(minus the EOS Visit) and the dose level will not be higher than the 40 mg/kg dose used  for Cohort B4. 
The starting dose for Part E (Cohort E1) will be the most clinically appropriate dose as determined by 
[CONTACT_644163], tolerability, and PD (reduction in galactitol level) in Part D and the 
dose will not be higher than the highest acceptable dose in Part D at the time of starting Part  E (after all 
subjects complete Cohorts D1 and D2 but may be before, during, or after Cohort  D3). The Safety 
Review Committee (SRC) reviewed/will review safety data before each dose escalation and before the 
start of Parts B, C, D, and E. Also, the Sponsor  reviewed/will review all PK and galactitol data as they 
become available.  
The dose for the first cohort of the Part D Extension (DE1) will be 20 mg/kg/day based  on acceptable 
SAD and MAD safety and PK data from Cohort D2. After SRC review of all SAD and M AD data and 
Sponsor review of PK and galactitol data for Cohorts D1 through D3, a second cohort of the Part D 
Extension (DE2) may be initiated to evaluate a dose higher than 20 mg/kg/day if this dose was well 
tolerated in the SAD and MAD portions of the st udy in both healthy volunteers and subject s with CG.   
The review of the PK data from Cohorts A1 through A [ADDRESS_862198] 2 cohorts of Part  B confirmed that 
once daily (QD) dosing is adequate.  
Number of Subjects: Up to  80 healthy subjects, between 18 and  46 subjects with CG  depending on 
the number of Part D Extension subjects who are or are not the same subjects as those in Part D , and up 
to 18 subjects with GALK -deficient Galactosemia are planned to be enrolled. More su bjects may be 
enrolled if the number of cohorts increases to study AT -007 doses >40 mg/kg.  Also, more subjects 
may be enrolled if the overall number of subjects per cohort in Parts D and E are increased up to 
[ADDRESS_862199] -to-follow-up among subjects treated with either placebo or 
AT-007. 
Diagnosis and Main Study Entry Criteria for Parts A, B, and C:  
Healthy male or non -pregnant, non -lactating female adult between 18 and 65 years of age, inclusive  
Diagnosis and Main Study Entry Criteria for Part D  and Part D Extension : 
Male and non -pregnant, non -lactating female adult between the ages of 18 and 65 years, inclusive, with 
a Classic Galactosemia (CG) diagnosis confirmed by [CONTACT_644164] 
(<1%) ga lactose -1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) activity in red blood cells or by [CONTACT_644165] (medical record or gene analysis report or written 
communication by [CONTACT_230996]), who have no other significant health problems unrelated 
to CG.  
For the Part D Extension, subjects who previ ously participated in but did not complete Part D must not 
have discontinued Part D because of study drug  related TEAE (s). 
Protocol AT -007-1001 V ersion 10.0 
Applied Therapeutics Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  3 September  2021 
Page 6 of 120 Diagnosis and Main Study Entry Criteria for Part E:  
Male and non -pregnant, non -lactating female adult between the ages of [ADDRESS_862200] of either absent or 
significantly decreased galactokinase (GALK) activity in red blood cells (medical record, enzyme 
activity report, genetic mutation report, or  written communication by [CONTACT_230996]), who 
have no other significant health problems unrelated to GALK -deficient Galactosemia .  
Investigational Product, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
AT-007 (capsules  or liquid suspension;  single and multiple oral doses ): once daily [QD] under fasting 
conditions for up to 7  days in healthy subjects; up to 27 days in subjects with CG who tolerated a 
previous single dose  (and up to 90 days during an Extension) ; and up to  27 days in subjects with 
GALK -deficient Galactosemia who tolerated a previous single dose. Doses between 0.5 and 40 mg/kg, 
oral, were  administered in Part  A of the study. Dose levels in subsequent parts of the study are based on 
the safety, PK, and galact itol (Parts D  and E only) results of previous cohorts and/or previous parts of 
the study.  Doses higher than 40  mg/kg may be evaluated if the human maximum observed 
concentration (C max) and area under the curve (AUC) are substantially lower than the corresponding 
values calculated in nonclinical experiments and no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed up to and 
including at the 40 mg/kg dose. If dose escalation above 40 mg/kg is feasible based on the above 
criteria, these higher doses may be invest igated in additional SAD and MAD cohorts in healthy 
subjects and in subjects with Galactosemia if no AT -007 levels are detected in the CSF collected from 
the healthy subjects enrolled in Cohort C3. Doses will be rounded according to  the available SKU  as 
described in the Pharmacy Manual  
Duration of Treatment: Subject participation will be a maximum of approximately 56, 63, 63, 100, 
and 100  days (from screening through EOS Visit) for Parts A, B, C, D, and E, respectively. For 
subjects in the Part D Extension  who did not previously participated in Part D (SAD and/or MAD) , 
study participation will be a maximum of approximately 178 days (screening through EOE Visit at 
[ADDRESS_862201] dose of study drug during the extension) . For subjects in the Part D Ext ension 
who previous participated in Part D (SAD and MAD), study participation will be a maximum of 
approximately 218 days (SAD and MAD) (screening through EOE Visit), assuming no re -screening 
needed for Part D Extension and not  counting the wash -out period  between the end of Part  D MAD and 
the initiation of Part D Extension.  
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  Matching placebo (capsules  or liquid 
suspension ) will be administered under the same conditions and on the same schedule as the 
investigational product in Parts A, B, D, E , and D Extension . Part C is open -label AT -007 (no placebo).  
Concomitant Medications and Dietary Restrictions:   
The following medications are prohibited within [ADDRESS_862202] dose of study drug: 1) sensitive substrates of Breast Cancer Resistance

dose of study drug if no screening visit) through the EOS or EOE Visit.  
Study Endpoints:  
Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoints of this study are overall safety and adverse events (AEs). Safety will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_716]:  
• AEs 
• Clinical safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis)  
• Physical examinations  
• Vital signs  
• Electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
Secondary Endpoints  
• PK parameters in healthy subjects, subjects with CG, and subjects with GALK -deficient 
Galactosemia  
• Galactose, galactitol, and other galactose metabolites in the blood of subjects with CG and 
subjects with GALK -deficient Galactosemia  
• Urine galactitol for subjects with CG an d subjects with GALK -deficient Galactosemia  
Exploratory Endpoints:  
• AT-007 level in the CSF of healthy subjects (Part C only)  
Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size:  The sample size was determined outside of statistical considerations.  The number of 
subjects is typi[INVESTIGATOR_323901] 1 studies of this type and is adequate to meet study objectives.  
Safety Analyses:   
The evaluation of safety will be based on the occurrence o f TEAEs; discontinuations from study drug 
and/or the study because of AEs; clinical safety laboratory test results, physical examination findings, 
vital sign evaluations, and 12 -lead ECGs results. All safety endpoints will be summarized 
descriptively. No s tatistical inference will be applied to the safety endpoints. Descriptive statistics will 
be calculated for quantitative safety data and frequency counts will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_644136].

Applied Therapeutics Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  3 September  2021 
Page 8 of 120 PK Analyses:   
PK calculations will be performed using appropriate software, e.g., Phoenix™ WinNonlin® 
(Version  6.3 or higher, Pharsight Corporation) and/or SAS® (Version 9.4 or higher, SAS Institute Inc.).  
PK parameters will be calculated using noncompartmental methods, using an appropriate model. 
Concentrations below the lower limit of quantitation (BLQ) will be treated as zero from the time of the 
first quantifiable concentration; embedded and terminal BLQ concentrations will be treated as 
“mis sing.” Actual sample times, if available, will be used in the PK analysis.  
AT-007 concentration -time data and PK parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_427938] (dose 
level) using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, min imum, maximum, 
percent coefficient of variation [CV%]).  
Dose proportionality, the proportionality of a change in systemic exposure with a change in dose, may 
be assessed using a power model or other appropriate methods.  
Details of the PK analyses, includin g any additional exploratory analyses, will be provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
PK samples will be stored for possible future analysis of AT -007 metabolites.  
Biomarker Analyses:  
For Parts D , E, and D Extension , blood and /or urine levels o f galactose and/or its metabolites 
(including galactitol) will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Details of these analyses will be 
provided in the SAP.

Page 18 of 120 1. INTRODUCTION  
AT-007 is an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) that is being developed by [CONTACT_644167]. (the Sponsor)  for the treatment of Classic  Galactosemia  (CG)  and other severe e nzyme 
deficiencies resulting  in Galactosemia , such as GALK D eficiency .  
There is no previous human experience with AT -007. This study  will be conducted in  
compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and all applicable regulatory  
requirement s. 
1.1. Background  
Galactosemia  is a potentially life -threatening condition caused by [CONTACT_644168]. The clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_644138]. The first 
acute phase occurs after birth when the dietary intak e of breast milk and formulas containing 
lactose produces a galactose toxicity syndrome manifested by [CONTACT_238015], failure to 
thrive, vomiting, cataract formation, blood coagulation defects, and renal tubule dysfunction. The 
second phase, which resu lts in long term complications of disease, occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_644139], with later development of speech abnormalities, mental retardation, 
neurological ataxias, cataract, and ovarian failure. This has been shown to be due to endogenous  
production of galactose within the body  and cant be prevented by [CONTACT_599190] . 
1.1.1.  Galactosemia  Types, Treatment, Prevalence, and Symptoms  
Galactosemia  is an inborn metabolic disease caused by [CONTACT_644169], a metabolite of lactose (Berry 2000; Augustin 2010 ). Galactose, the C -[ADDRESS_862216]: galactokinase (GALK), 
galactose -1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) and UDP -galactose 4’ -epi[INVESTIGATOR_528587] (GALE) 
(Figure  1). Mutations in the genes coding for these enzymes give rise to different types of 
Galactosemia , which in the developed world ar e usually detected by [CONTACT_644170].  
AT-007 is in clinical dev elopment for the treatment of CG , a subtype of Type I Galactosemia  
further described in Section  1.1.2  and Section  1.1.3  and other severe enzyme deficiencies, such 
as GALK deficiency .

1.1.2.  GALT Deficiency (Includes Classic  Galactosemia )  
GALT d eficiency can be classified into three categories based on its residual activity: Classic  
Galactosemia  (CG) , Clinical Variant Galactosemia , and Duarte Galacto semia . Classic  
Galactosemia  patients exhibit severe GALT deficiency with absent or barely detectable 
erythrocyte and hepatic activity, whereas Clinical Variant Galactosemia  is associated with 
residual GALT activity in the RBC and/or liver. Duarte Galactosemia  is associated with 15 % to 
35% GALT activity. The residual or low GALT activity displayed by [CONTACT_644171] e endogenously produced galactose, and 
in some cases minimal external lactose/galactose intake through the diet can be tolerated. Thus, 
Clinical Variant and Duarte Galactosemia  patients often do not display the long -term 
complications seen in CG patients, as long as a stringent diet is adhered to. In contrast, patients 
with severe GALT deficiency ( CG) display severe long -term complications, despi[INVESTIGATOR_644140], and require additional therapeutic intervention to prevent these outcomes.  
Type I Galacto semia  (GALT deficiency) is the best studied form of the disease. Classic  
Galactosemia  (CG) is characterized by [CONTACT_644172]/absent or barely detectable 
GALT activity; Clinical Variant Galactosemia  is associated with residual GALT activity in the 
RBC and/or liver; and biochemical variant Galactosemia  is associated with 15 % to 35% GALT 
activity (e.g., Duarte Galactosemia ) (Fridovich -Keil et al, 2014 ). CG occurs with a frequency of 
150,000 live births in the [LOCATION_002] and in other multiethnic pop ulations (Pyhtila et al, 2014 ). 
In the US, this translates to an incidence of approximately [ADDRESS_862217] elevated levels of galactose -1-phosphate (gal -1P), galactitol and 
galactonate in tissues, blood and uri ne. Galactitol and galactonate are products of alternative 
metabolism of excess galactose which accumulates when the Leloir pathway is blocked

Page 20 of 120 (Figure  1). Erythrocyte gal -1P levels have been reported to be 20 to 30 times higher than normal, 
and erythrocyte galactitol levels up to 8 times higher than normal (Yager et al, 2003 ). Galactitol 
is not detectable in the plasma of healthy controls but is present in th e plasma of treated 
individuals with CG at 10 to 12 µmol/L on average, and urinary galactitol can be ≥10-fold higher 
than in normal subjects (Palmieri et al, 1999 ). Galactitol levels in the brain have also been shown 
to be elevated in CG patients via magne tic resonance imaging ( MRI ). 
CG typi[INVESTIGATOR_644141], with symptoms of poor feeding and poor growth, 
jaundice, liver enlargement and dysfunction, lethargy, hypotonia, renal tubular disease, cataracts 
and E. coli  sepsis (Berry 2000 ). In the newborn period, CG is life -threatening but early 
implementation of a galactose -restricted diet, within the first 10  to 14 days of life, typi[INVESTIGATOR_644142], and infants appear normal until 1  to 2 years of age, 
when lo ng-term complications begin to emerge (Berry 1997, Demirbas 2018 ).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_644143]/implementation of a galactose -restricted diet, the majority of patients 
with CG still develop long -term complications. Such chronic complications include CNS -relate d 
abnormalities (below average IQ [72%], tremor [46%], ataxia [15%], dysarthria [24%], speech 
and language deficiency [88%], depression [39%], anxiety [67%]); low bone density (24%); 
presenile cataracts (>21%); growth delay; and , in almost all females, primary ovarian 
insufficiency (POI) (Berry et al, 2018; Weisbren et al, 2012 ). It is unclear whether the CNS 
impairment is progressive throughout life, as there is a lack of well -controlled longitudinal 
assessments; however, a negative correlation has been de monstrated between age and cognition, 
suggesting the disease may be progressive through adulthood.  
CNS dysfunction seen in Galactosemia  patients appears to be due to broad structural and 
functional abnormalities, which may be the result of diffuse substrat e or metabolite deposition 
within the brain. Brain imaging studies have shown cerebral and cerebellar atrophy as well as 
white matter abnormalities, including increased neurite dispersion and lower neurite density. 
Grey matter abnormalities have also been detected using voxel based morphometry. Functional 
MRI has shown altered neural activity and connectivity within several regions of the brain.   
1.1.3.  GALK Deficiency  
Type II Galactosemia  (GALK Deficiency  or GALKD ) displays wide variation in incidence due 
to thr ee distinct founder mutations, in the Romani population (common in Eastern Europe, 
Ireland and the [LOCATION_006]), Costa Rican population , and Japanese population. General incidence in 
Europe is approximately 1:50,000, but incidence in [LOCATION_013] was recently reported t o be 
1:40,000 due to an increased population of those of Romani descent. Incidence in the US 
population has not been well studied, but it is estimated to be 1:100,000. Patien ts with GALK 
deficiency can not convert galactose into gal -1P and thus do not have elevated levels of this 
metabolite of galactose. Instead, they exhibit elevated levels of galactitol and galactonate. The 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_644144] (Hennermann et al, 2011 ), although cases of 
pseudotumor cerebri in the neonatal period have been also described, believed to be due to 
increased intracranial pressure caused by [CONTACT_644173] (Bosch et al, 
2002 ).  
Until recently, long -term complications, specifically CNS complications (microcephaly, low 
intelligence, and speech and motor difficulties) such as those seen in GALT deficiency were not 
consid ered features of GALKD . However, a detai led analysis of a GALKD  cohort of the Bosnian 
Protocol AT -007-1001 V ersion 10.0 
Applied Therapeutics Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  3 September  2021 
Page 21 of 120 population that ha d immigrated to [LOCATION_013] revealed high rates of intellectual deficits, 
microcephaly, and failure to thrive, even in those patients with good compliance on a galactose -
restricted diet. Rates of these CNS complications were similar to those seen in GALT def iciency. 
Because GALKD  patients display elevated galactitol levels, but not gal -1P (which  does not form 
in GALKD  patients), this study supported the strong likelihood that galactitol, not gal -1P, may 
be responsible  for CNS complications seen in Galactosemia  patients (Hennermann, 2011 ). 
1.1.4.  Enzyme Defects and Mechanisms of Disease  
It was long hypothesized that accumulation of gal -1P was responsible for the CNS complications 
and ovarian insufficiency observed in patients with GALT deficiency (Type I Galactosemia ) 
because patients with GALK deficiency (Type II Galactosemia ), who do not produce or 
accumulate gal -1P, were thought to be free of such complications. However, a study of GALK 
deficiency in a cohort of a Bosnian population that had immigrated to [LOCATION_013] ( Hennermann, 
2011 ), revealed high rates of CNS dysfunction and developmental deficiencies similar to those 
seen in GALT -deficient patients. GALK -deficient patients did not have elevated gal -1P, either 
before or after implementation of a galactose -restricted di et, but did demonstrate highly elevated 
levels of galactitol. On a galactose -restricted diet, GALK D patients’ galactose levels largely 
normalized, but galactitol levels remained elevated by [CONTACT_2902] [ADDRESS_862218] prospective study of GALK -deficient patients identified 
via newborn screening. Before this study, these patients had been found primarily in countries 
where newborn screening and careful evaluations of Galactosemia  outcomes were not performed 
(e.g., Bosnia and Bulgaria ). This new information provided by [CONTACT_644174] D patient 
cohort suggested that galactitol  (not gal -1P) is the metabolite responsible for CNS complications  
in patients with Galactosemia . 
Several other clinical findings support th e role of galactitol (either in addition to gal -1P or 
instead of gal -1P) in long -term complications in patients with GALT and GALK deficiencies. 
For example, little  correlation has been found in Galactosemia  patien ts between the levels of 
gal-1P and clinic al manifestations (Pyhtila et al, 2014 ). In addition, galactitol accumulation in the 
brain (detected by [CONTACT_644175]) has been reported to cause cerebral 
edema ( Martineli et al, 2016 ), encephalopathy ( Berry  et al, 2001 ), and delay of psychomotor 
development with bilateral ocular cataracts ( Otaduy et al, 2006 ). A restricted lactose -free diet 
induced almost complete resolution of the MRI white matter signal intensity abnormalities and 
disappearance of the  galactitol peaks ( Otaduy et al, 2006 ). 
Experimental results detailed below provide additional evidence against gal -1p (or gal -1p alone) 
and/or point toward galactitol as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of the delayed  and/or 
long-term complications o f Galactosemia  such as CNS disturbances and possibly ovarian 
insufficiency later in life:  
• AR inhibition was shown to prevent galactose -induced ovarian dysfunction in the 
Sprague -Dawley rat ( Meyer et al, 1992 ). 
• A model of CG in Drosophila melanogaster , whos e genome contains sequences 
related to all three Leloir pathway genes, mimics aspects of both the acute (survival 
of larvae) and long -term (climbing ability of adult males and fecundity of females) 
outcomes of CG (Daenzer et al, 2016 ). Like human patients,  and unlike mice, 
GALT -deficient Drosophila  larvae exhibit galactose -dependent lethality, which can 
Protocol AT -007-[ADDRESS_862219] the 
long-standing hypothesis that gal -1P accumulation underlies the pathophysiology of 
acute and long -term outcomes in GALT -null Drosophila  and suggests that other 
metabolite(s) of galac tose are responsible for the phenotype.  
• Another model of CG, the GALT -null Sprague -Dawley rat model was created by 
[CONTACT_644176] -Cas9 gene editing technology [J. Fridovich -Keil, PhD, personal 
communication]. The GALT -null animals are homozygous for M3, a sm all frameshift 
insertion designated as rGALTm3. All M3/M3 neonates demonstrate complete 
absence of GALT activity in all tissues tested with apparently normal levels of the 
other Leloir enzymes, GALK and GALE. Like human patients with CG, following 
exposure  to galactose , M3/M3 rats demonstrate abnormal accumulation of galactose, 
galactitol, galactonate, and gal -1P. All homozygotes also demonstrate conspi[INVESTIGATOR_644145] - type animals. In contrast 
to human patients with CG, the GALT -null rats do not exhibit the lethal neonatal 
symptoms following exposure to mothers’ milk (possibly because rat breast milk 
contains 10% of the lactose content of human breast milk), but they do demonstrate, 
in addition to catarac ts, mild growth restriction both before and after weaning and a 
variety of CNS deficits as adults. These deficits can be revealed by [CONTACT_644177] (tests balance and coordination), Morris Water Maze (tests memory and 
cognitive flexibility), a nd Novel Object Recognition  tests. 
1.1.5.  Clinical Management of Galactosemia  
Currently, there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_644146]-term complications associated with severe deficiencies in GALT or GALK. Standard of 
care is immediate implementation of a life -long galactose -restricted diet. Although the diet can 
reverse the acute clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_644147], it does not prevent the appearance  of long -term complications in 
patients with severe enzyme deficiencies.  
Guidelines recommend that children with severe GALT or GALK deficiencies be screened for 
speech and language delay, hearing and cognitive disorders at ages [ADDRESS_862220], 
developmental pediatrician, etc. Also recommended are regular neurological and psychosocial 
evaluations, bone density and ophthalmologic assessments, a comprehensive dietary evaluation 
including monitoring of calcium intake, vitamins D and K supplementation if necessary, 
hormonal status evaluation and hormone replacement therapy consideration, as well as a regular 
exercise and assessment of skeletal problems. Periodic assessment of galactose metabolites in 
erythrocytes can help clinicians confirm dietary compliance (Welling et al, 2017 ). 
Protocol AT -007-[ADDRESS_862221] an IQ under 85 and live 
at home with their parents or in a care facility. Because th ere are not many patients with 
Galactosemia  over the age of 40 years old (because most died at birth prior to the initiation of 
newborn screening), the long -term prognosis of adults with Galactosemia  is unclear. 
Complications of disease that present in adu lthood, such as tremor and seizures, have not been 
studied prospectively in adults, nor has progression of cognitive impairment and IQ.  
1.1.6.  Galactosemia Prevalence  
Prior to the initiation of newborn screening, which began in the US in the 1960s and was 
mandato ry in all 50 States in 2004, nearly all infants with CG died at birth due to acute exposure 
to lactose. The current living population of CG patients in the US is estimated to be 
approximately 2,800 individuals. This is based on cumulative newborn screening  results 
identifying 2,500 patients in the US from initiation of screening through 2014, and a yearly birth 
rate of approximately 80 patients per year in the US (providing an additional estimated 
240 births in 2014  through 2018). The GALK -deficient Galacto semia population is largely 
undetermined in the US, but is estimated to be significantly lower than the CG population, based 
on an extremely low incidence in the US ethnic population.   
1.2. Development of Aldose Reductase Inhibitors  (ARIs)  
If accumulation of g alactitol is responsible for the long-term complications of Galactosemia , 
then it stands to reason that blocking AR from converting galactose to galactitol, in combination 
with a galactose -restricted diet, may b e able to prevent/reduce these Galactosemia  complications.  
Applied Therapeutics Inc. (the Sponsor) is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_644148]: 
one ARI is designated as AT -001 and another one is designated as AT -007. AT-001 is not CNS 
penetrant, while AT -007 penetrates the CNS when adminis tered orally.  
Using a genetic rat model of Galactosemia  (“GALT null”), the Sponsor has successfully 
recapi[INVESTIGATOR_644149] I Galactosemia  seen in humans. The accumulation of 
galactitol in various parenchyma and the onset of cataracts in th is animal model can serve as 
biochemical and clinical markers of disease and disease progression.  
In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_644150] -null neonatal rats, AT -001 (or placebo) was administered orally, 
suspended in the liquid formula, starting on the day after they were  born and continuing for 9 to 
18 days. Treatment with AT -001 decreased galactitol levels in the liver and brain and reduced or 
prevented the development of cataracts.  
The Sponsor decided to develop AT -007 for the treatment of CG because it is both CNS 
pene trant and retinally penetrant. In the same “GALT null” rat model, treatment with AT -007 
was able to no rmalize biochemical markers of Galactosemia  and prevented the onset of cataracts , 
but importantly also prevented  and CNS dysfunction.   
This protocol (Stu dy AT -007-1001) is the first -in-human study for AT -007. 
1.3. Choice of Study Population  
Study AT -007-1001 is being  conducted in healthy adult subjects (Parts A [single ascending dose 
or SAD] and B  and C  [multiple ascending dose or MAD] ); adult subjects with CG (Part D [SAD , 
Protocol AT -007-1001 V ersion 10.0

Page 24 of 120 MAD]  and Part D Extension ); and adult subjects with GALK -deficient  Galactosemia  (Part E 
[SAD  and MAD] ). 
1.4. Dose Rationale  
The initial first -in-human dose for Part A (SAD) was 0.5 mg/kg. This d id not exceed the 
maximum recommended starting dose (MRSD) using a safety factor of 10.  
The MRSD is based on the 13-week  rat and dog Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) studies 
evaluating doses of 50, 200, and 1000  mg/kg/day in rats and 50, 200 , and 400 mg/kg/day in dogs.  
AT-007 w as administered to Beagle dogs once daily (QD) for at least 91 consecutive days via 
oral gavage. The following parameters and endpoints were evaluated in this study: clinical signs, 
body weights, body weight gains, food consumpt ion, ophthalmology, electrocardiography, 
clinical pathology parameters (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), 
toxicokinetic parameters, gross necropsy findings, organ weights, and histopathologic 
examinations.  
There were no test artic le-related changes for ophthalmology , electrocardiography, clinical 
pathology , or organ weight  data throughout the study .  
Administration of AT -007 by [CONTACT_644178] 
50, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day. The early term ination (Day 85) in 1 male dog from the 
400 mg/kg/day was associated with hematopoietic changes that were not observed in any other 
male or female dog at any dose level; as such, this observation was considered sporadic and a 
relationship with the test -article could not be established.  
Therefore, the no-observed -adverse -effect level (NO AEL) was considered to be 400 mg/kg/day. 
This dosage corresponded to mean AUC 0-24 values of 1,130,000 and 1,160,000 h*ng/mL on 
Day 91 for males and females, respectively , and Cmax values of  AT-007 of 145,000 and 
155,000  ng/mL on Day 91 for males and females, respectively   
In the 13-week  rat toxicology study, doses of 50, 200, and 1000 mg/kg/day were administered 
QD for 91 consecutive da ys via oral gavage. The following parameters and endpoints were 
evaluated in this study: clinical signs, body weights, body weight gains, food consumption, 
ophthalmology, clinical pathology parameters (hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, and 
urina lysis), toxicokinetic parameters, gross necropsy findings, organ weights, and 
histopathologic examinations.  
There were no control or  test article -related  clinical observations or significant effects on body 
weights, food consumption, ophthalmology, clinic al pathology, or mortality findings throughout 
the study. All gross necropsy and histopathological findings for the main and recovery periods 
resulted in no evidence of test article -related effects . Therefore, the NOAEL in the rat was 
considered to be 1000  mg/kg/day. This dosage corresponded to mean AUC 0-24 value s of 
2,040,000  and 2,360,000  h*ng/mL on Day 90 for males and females, respectively , and Cmax 
values of  AT-007 of 182,000  and 306,000  ng/mL on Day  90 for males and females, respectively . 
Based on the NOAEL of 1000 mg/kg in rats and the NO AEL of 400 mg/kg in dogs, the human 
equivalent doses (HEDs) were calculated to be the following : 160 mg/kg/day from the rat and 
216 mg/kg/day from the dog. Because the NO AEL of 400 mg/kg/day in dogs is the lower of  the 
two, the HED of 216 mg/kg/day was chosen for the derivation of the MRSD. Therefore, using 
Protocol AT -007-1001 V ersion 10.0 
Applied Therapeutics Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  3 September  2021 
Page 25 of 120 the default safety factor of 10, the MRSD for AT -007 is 21.6 mg/kg/day. After consideration of 
other factors related to known pharmacology and another significan t clinical program in the 
same mechanistic class, the starting dose for AT -007 in Part A was 0.5 mg/kg/day. This equates 
to a safety margin of 432 (216/0.5).  
Dose level s in Part A escalate d from 0.5 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg , 20 mg/kg , and 40 mg/kg  
in the  5 cohorts (Cohorts A1 through A5) with no dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) identified  in any 
cohort . 
The first 3 cohorts  in Part B (Cohort s B1, B2, and B3 ) escalated from  5 mg/kg  to 10 mg/kg to 
20 mg/kg following acceptable results for the same doses in Part A . Cohort B4 will start with this 
version of the protocol (version 5.0) and use a dose of 40 mg/kg based on that dose being 
acceptable in Cohort A5 . The study drug exposure results were  carefully considered to ensure 
that the plasma concentrations mea sured in Part A were  in the range to detect changes in AR 
activity and galactitol levels in subjects with CG.  
The doses in Part C are based on those in Part B. Cohort C1 was conducted with the same dose 
as Cohort B2 (10 mg/kg) . Cohort C2 used the dose as Cohort B3  (20 mg/kg) . Cohort C3 will use 
the same dose as Cohort B4  (40 mg/kg ). 
The initial dose in Part D (5 mg/kg) was  based on data from Part A  (Cohorts A1 through A4 ) and 
Part B (first 2  cohorts) . 
The starting dose in Part E will be the mo st clinically appropriate dose as determined by [CONTACT_644179], tolerability, and PD (reduction in galactitol level) in Part D . The dose will 
not be higher than the highest acceptable dose in Part D at the time of starting Part E (after all 
subje cts complete Cohorts D1 and D2  but may be before, during, or after Cohort D3 ). 
The dose for the first cohort of the Part D Extension ( Cohort DE1) will be 20 mg/kg/day based 
on acceptable SAD and MAD safety and PK data from Cohort D2.  
AT-007 dose levels  in Part A  ranged  from  0.5 and 40 mg/kg/day.  Dose levels in subsequent parts 
of the study are based on the safety and PK results  (and galactitol results in Part s D, E, and D 
Extension  only)  of previous cohorts and/or previous parts of the study. D oses highe r than 
40 mg/kg may be evaluated if the human C max and AUC are substantially lower than the 
corresponding values calculated in nonclinical experiments and no DLT is observed up to and 
including at the 40 mg/kg dose. If dose escalation above 40 mg/kg is fea sible based on the above 
criteria, these higher doses may be investigated in additional SAD and MAD cohorts in healthy 
subjects and in subjects with Galactosemia  if no AT -007 levels are detected in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_13858] ( CSF) collected from the healthy s ubjects enrolled in Cohort  C3. 
Although it is anticipated that daily doses do not need to be higher than 40 mg/kg, there is a 
chance that the PK data observed during the study  will show otherwise. If this happens, then 
additional subjects may be enrolled.  
Protocol AT -007-[ADDRESS_862222] -in-human study is the following:  
• To evaluate the safety of single and multiple ascending doses of orally administered 
AT-[ADDRESS_862223] s with CG  or GALK -deficient

and subjects with  GALK -deficient  Galactosemia  
• Urine galactitol for subject s with CG  and subjects with  GALK -deficient  
Galactosemia  
The exploratory endpoint s are the foll owing:  
• AT-007 level in the CSF  of healthy subjects  (Part C only)  
PK samples will be stored for possible future analysis of AT-[ADDRESS_862225] of 
AT-007 on biomarkers of galactose metabol ism (galactose and galactose metabolites) in subjects 
with galactosemia . The study is being  conducted in multiple centers in the US and Europe.  This

The total number of subjects column reflects the maximum number of subjects if all cohorts are 
conducted with the planned number of subjects and no subject participates in more than 1 cohort  and/or 
part. However, in Part s D and E , subjects  are allowed to participate in multiple cohorts (assuming no 
safety or tolerability issues in the prior cohort) on any treatment assignment with a  ≥ 5-day washout 
period between the last dose of study drug in one cohort and the first dose of study drug in the next 
cohort. Also, Part D  subjects  can participate in Part D Extension at any time after the Part D EOS Visit 
(Part D completers  and those who  discontinued for any reason other than study drug related TEAE and 
had an EOS Visit more than [ADDRESS_862226] dose ) or any time beyond  [ADDRESS_862227] dose in 
Part D (Part  D subjects who discontinue d Part D for any reason other than study dr ug related TEAE  and 
did not have an EOS Visit more than [ADDRESS_862228] dose ). 
Parts A  and B are double -blind. Part C is open -label.  In Parts D , E, and D Extension , the clinical site staff 
(except for the unblinded pharmacist) and the subjects are blinded to study treatment  but the Sponsor is 
not blinded.   
The number of cohorts and total number of subjects may increase if doses > 40 mg/kg are tested in 
additional cohorts (see Section  1.4). Also, in Parts D and E, the overall number of subjects per cohort 
may be increased up to [ADDRESS_862229] -to-follow -up amon g subjects treated with 
either placebo or AT -007. Up to 28 total subjects in up to 2 cohorts are planned for Part D Extension.

Within each Part, the Cohorts are sequential. Solid lines wit h arrows indicate that data from the part or cohort at the 
non-arrow end are required before the part or cohort at the arrow end can start. Dotted lines indicate cohorts  (C1 and 
B3; C3 and B4 ) that will be conducted simultaneously. Parts D, E, and D Extension  are not dependent on Part C 
results,  and no temporal relationship between Parts D, E, and D Extension  and Part C  is implied. Also, with the 
exception of Cohorts  B4, C3, D3, E2, E3, and DE2  being directly or indirectly dependent on Cohort A5 results , no 
temporal relationship between Cohort A5 and any other part/cohort is implied.  Cohort DE2 (start and dose level) are 
not dependent on res ults from Cohort DE1. Figure is not to scale.  
Parts A, B, and C are being  conducted in a single  clinical research unit (CRU) in the US. 
Subjects within each cohort in Part A were  enrolled and dosed at approximately the same time 
(within [ADDRESS_862230] cohort and on the same day for the subs equent cohorts). Subjects 
within each cohort in Part B will be enrolled and dosed on the same day s. The first cohort of 
Part C (C1) was conducted simultaneously with the third cohort of Part B (B3) and receive d the 
same dose (10 mg/kg) as the second cohort of Part B (B2). The second cohort of Part C (C2) 
started after all subjects in the third cohort of Part B (B 3) completed the study (minus the End-
of-Study [ EOS ] Visit) and receive d the same  dose (20 mg/kg) as Cohort B3 ; safety and PK 
results for Coh ort C1 were also considered before starting Cohort C2 . The third cohort in Part C 
(C3) will be  conducted simultaneously with the fourth  cohort of Part B (B 4) and receive the 
same dose ( 40 mg/kg) ; safety and PK results for Cohort C2 were also  considered bef ore starting 
Cohort C3. For Cohorts B3 and C1 , subjects were  enrolled and dosed on the same day but in 
different parts of the CRU to separate double -blind (B 3) from open -label (C 1) dosing . All 
subjects in Cohort C2 were  enrolled and dosed on the same day.  All subjects in Cohort s B4 and 
C3 will be enrolled and dosed on the same day  but in different parts of the CRU to separate 
double -blind (B 4) from open -label (C 3) dosing.  
Parts D, E, and D Extension  are being  conducted in multiple CRUs. It is not anticipated that 
subjects within each cohort will be enrolled/dosed at approximately the same time.

Page 29 of 120 Initially, 4 double -blind dosing cohorts were planned in the SAD portion of the study in healthy 
subjects (Part  A); subsequently, a fifth cohort (A5) was added to Part A . Within each cohort of 
[ADDRESS_862231] 24 hours before any of the additional subjects (6  subjects: 5  random ly 
assigned  to AT -007 and 1 random ly assigned  to placeb o) in the first cohort were dosed. The dose 
level s of AT -007 for Cohorts A1, A2, A3, A4 , and A5  were  0.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg . 
Before the study proceed ed to Part B (MAD in healthy subjects), s afety d ata from Cohort s A1 
through A4  in Part A  (SAD in healthy subjects)  were  evaluated by [CONTACT_7244] 
(SRC ) (Section  3.4) and all PK data from Cohorts A1 through A4 were  evaluated by  [CONTACT_429] . As of this protocol version, Cohorts A1 through A 5 (0.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) have 
completed the study  with acceptable results.  
Four  double -blind dosing cohorts are planned in the MAD portion of the study in healthy 
subjects (Part  B). Wit hin each cohort of 6 or 8 subjects, 4 or 6 subjects will be randomly 
assigned to AT -007 and the remaining 2 subjects will be randomly assigned to placebo. Subjects 
will receive  study drug  (AT-007 or placebo) QD  for [ADDRESS_862232] cohort (B1) was 5 mg/kg  based on the results of Part  A. Subsequent 
cohorts (B2 and B3) were given 10 and 20 mg/kg based on results from the previous cohorts  in 
both Parts A and B . Coh ort B4 is planned with a dose level of 40 mg/kg  based on  data from 
Cohort A5.  
The review of the PK data from Cohorts A1 through A4  and the first 2 cohorts of Part B 
confirm ed that once daily (QD) dosing is adequate.  
Part C consist s of 3 open -label MAD dos ing cohorts (same dose levels as Cohort s B2, B3, and  
B4) in healthy subjects. Cohort C1 was conducted at the same time as Cohort B3 using the same 
dose (10 mg/kg) as Cohort B2. Cohort C2 was conducted after all subjects in Cohort B 3 
completed the study (mi nus the EOS Visit) and used the same dose (20 mg/kg) as Cohort B3 ; 
data from Cohort C1 were also considered before starting Cohort  C2. Cohort C 3 will run 
concurrently with  Cohort B 4 and use the same dose (40 mg/kg ); data from Cohort C [ADDRESS_862233] the same schedule as the subjects in Part B  (minus 
randomization) .  
Before the study proceed ed to Part D (SAD  and MAD in subjects with CG), safety d ata from 
Cohorts  A1 through A4  in Part A  and the f irst 2 cohorts in Part  B were  evaluated by [CONTACT_644180].  
Three dosing cohorts are planned for subjects with CG (Part D). The same subjects will receive 
both the single dose and the multiple doses. Within each cohort  of 6 subjects , 4 subjects will be 
randomly assigned to AT-007 and 2 subjects will be randomly assigned to placebo. Following a 
single dose of study drug ( AT-007 or placebo ), there will be  a 5-day washout. Subjects  who 
tolerate the single -dose will receive 1 daily dose  of the same study drug ( AT-007 or placebo ) for 
[ADDRESS_862234] dose.  
The starting dose for Part D (i.e., for Cohort D1) was based on results from Part A (Cohorts A1 
through A4) and Cohorts B1 and B2 and at 5 mg/kg was lower  than the dose for Cohort  B2 
(10 mg/kg) . The dose for Cohort D2 (20 mg/kg) was  based on results from these cohorts plus 
Cohorts B3  and D1 ; results for Cohort C1 were  also considered.  The dose for Cohort D3 will be 
based on results from all cohorts in Parts A  and B  and Cohorts D1 and D2  and will not be higher 
than the dose for Cohort B4 .  
Before the study proceeds to Part E (SAD  and MAD in subjects with GALK -deficient  
Galactosemia ), safety data from all completed cohorts in Part s A, B, and D  of the study  will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_644181].  The 
starting dose for Part E will not be higher than the highest acceptable dose in Par t D at the time 
of starting Part E (after all subjects complete Cohorts D1 and D2 but may be before, during, or 
after Cohort D3) . The dose for subsequent cohorts (if any) in Part E will be based on results from 
the previous cohort(s) in Part E.  
One to 3 dosing cohort  are planned for subjects with GALK -deficient  Galactosemia  (Part E). The 
same subjects will receive both the single dose and the multiple doses. Within each cohort of 
6 subjects, 4  subjects will be randomly assigned to AT -007 and 2 subjects will be randomly 
assigned to placebo. Following a single dose of study drug (AT -007 or placebo), there will be a 
5-day washout. Subjects who tolerate the single -dose will receive 1 daily dose of the same study 
drug (AT -007 or placebo) for [ADDRESS_862235] dose . 
Notes for Parts D and E: The overall number of subjects per cohort m ay be increased up to 
[ADDRESS_862236] -to-follow -up among subjects treated with either placebo 
or AT -007. Subjects treated with study drug ( placebo  or AT -007) in a cohort may be randomized 
to treatment in another cohort (separate co nsent required) within the same Part  (assuming no 
safety or tolerability issues in the prior cohort) as long as there is a washout period of ≥[ADDRESS_862237] cohort of the Part D Extension (DE1) will be 20 mg/kg/day based on 
acceptable SAD and MAD safety and PK data from Cohort D2. After SRC review of all SAD 
and MAD data and Sponsor review of PK and galactitol data for Cohorts D1 through D3, a 
second cohort of the Part D Extension (DE2) may be initiated to evaluate a dose >20 mg/kg/day 
if this dose was well tolerated in the SAD and MAD portions of the study in both healthy 
volunteers and subjects with CG . 
In Part D Extension, w ithin each cohort of up to 28 subjects, subjects will be randomly assigned 
in a 3:1 to AT -007 and placebo. Subjects will receive 1 daily dose of the same study drug 
(AT-007 or placebo) for [ADDRESS_862238] dose.  The EOE Visit will not be required for s ubjects 
who transition to a separate Open -Label Extenstion Study . For t hese subjects  the study 
completion will be the completion of the Treatment Period  at Day 91.  
For all its parts (A, B, C , D, E, and D Extension ), the study consist s of a Screening Period 
(28 days [Day -28 to Day -1] in Parts A, B, and C ; 40 days [Day -40 to Day -1] in Part s D and E; 
and Day -[ADDRESS_862239] visit in Part D was > 60 days before Day 1 in the Part D Extension ]), a 
period of study treatment and associ ated assessments, and an EOS Visit ([ADDRESS_862240] 
dose of study drug)  (for Part D Extension, the visit at [ADDRESS_862241] dose is called the end 
of extension [EOE] Visit) . Part D Extension de novo subjects may also participate in optional 
prescreening. Subjects will be randomized and receive the first dose of study drug on Day  1. At a 
minimum, subjects will remain at the clinical research unit (CRU) through [ADDRESS_862242] 2 in-clinic stay s and monthly visits (home health or in -
clinic) with most doses taken at home. Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study 
after taking study drug will not be replaced.  
The Schedules of Assessments for Parts A, B , C, D, E, and D Extension  are provided in 
Appendix  A (Part A) , Appendi x B (Part B ), Appendix  C (Part C), Appendix  D (Part D) , 
Appendix  E (Part  E), and Appendix  F (Part D Extension), respectively.  
At selected time points d uring all parts of the study , all subjects will have the following:  
• Assessment of AEs  
• Blood and urine samples collected for routine safety laboratory assessments  
• Physical examinations, assessment of vital  signs, and ECGs  
• Pregnancy tests ( all females  at screening and females of childbearing potential 
subsequently ) 
• Blood samples collected for PK  
For subjects enrolled  in selected  cohort s in Parts A and D  (Cohort s A4, A5, and D3), urine 
samples will be collected at selected time points after the single dose for the assessment of 
AT-007.  
Subjects in Part C  will have a lumbar puncture  on Day [ADDRESS_862243] dose will be  
based on the PK data from completed cohorts in Part B . The intent is for the lumbar puncture  to 
be taken close to the time of the maximum observed concentration (T max) of AT -[ADDRESS_862244] blood samples taken for the assessment 
of GALT activity in red blood cells, GALT gene analysis, and aldose reductase activity ; these 
assessments will also be done for Part D Extension subjects who did not participate in Part D but 
will not be repeated for those who did participate in Part D. Also, subjects in both Part D and 
Protocol AT -007-[ADDRESS_862245] blood samples taken for the assessment 
of GALK activity in red  blood cells, GALK gene analysis, aldose reductase activity, as well as 
galactose and its metabolites and urine collected for the assessment of galactitol.  
Within each multi -cohort part (A, B, C, and D [and E , if applicable ]) of the study, in the 
subseque nt cohorts after the first cohort, the dose may be increased, decreased, or repeated . The 
SRC will review  safety (including AE, laboratory, physical examination, vital signs, and ECG 
data) through Days  3, 8, 8, 12, and 12 during Parts A, B, C, D, and E, respectively , for each 
cohort and provide a recommendation for the next cohort  as needed . If there is a second cohort in 
Part D Extension, the dose will be higher than 20 mg/kg and depend on the results for that dose 
in healthy subjects and subjects with CG in Part D.  
3.2. Rationale for Overall Study Design  
The overall study design is commonly used for Phase [ADDRESS_862246] cohort, is designed to limit the number of 
subjects exposed to a potentially unsafe drug or unsafe dose. The durations of the in -clinic stays 
are based on safety  and practical considera tions to ensure proper assessment of potential AEs and 
collection of biological samples and various examinations/measurements required by [CONTACT_1758]. 
An EOS  or EOE  Visit is conducted at [ADDRESS_862247] dose to assess the outcome of AEs (if 
any) after  study drug treatment and to ensure proper reporting of AEs with onset during the 
post-treatment period. Use of a n SRC to assess safety and PK data before dose escalation and 
before transitioning from single doses (Part A) to multiple doses (Part s B and C ) is standard 
practice in such studies. Having  safety and PK  data in healthy subjects before dosing subjects 
with the proposed indication (s)) (Part s D, E, and D Extension ) is also standard practice. Having 
longer duration doses not exceed doses that have be en studied for shorter durations is standard 
practice as well. Having the Investigator (with explicit agreement from the Sponsor) rather than 
the SRC decide if safety for the sentinel subjects in Cohort A1 is acceptable and if a subject in 
Part D or E will start multiple dos ing with study drug  after the single dose are practical 
consideration because the decision s needs to be made within 24 hours (Cohort A1) and within 
the 5-day washout period  (individual subjects in Part s D and E ). Galactose and its metabo lites 
are only measured in subjects with CG  or GALK -deficient  Galactosemia  (Part s D, E, and 
D Extension ) because AR (the enzyme inhibited by [CONTACT_50182] -007) converts galactose to galactitol only 
in the presence of extremely high levels of galactose  (found in subjects with CG  or GALK -
deficient  Galactosemia  but not healthy subjects) .   
3.3. Study Drug Administration Schedules  
Parts A , B, C, and D of the study will start more or less  sequential ly followed by [CONTACT_644182] E 
and D Extension more or less concurrently. However,  conduct of all study parts will overlap 
(Figure  2 and Section  3.1).  
Within each  multi -cohort  part, the cohorts (dose levels) will be  dosed sequential ly. The SRC will 
review available safety data through a pre -specified timeframe (Day 3 for Part A, Day 8 for

Page 33 of 120 20 mg/kg and depend on the results for that dose in healthy subjects and subjects with CG in 
Part D. Additional cohorts will be enrolled if it is deemed appropriate after safety assessment by 
[CONTACT_644183]. A decision to repeat a dos e level or to study another 
higher or lower dose level may be made. The Investigator(s) and Institutional Review Boards 
(IRBs) / Independent Ethics Committees ( IECs)  will be notified of these decisions.   
The SRC will also review data for the last cohort fo r each study part except that there will be no 
next cohort within the same part of the study.  
AT-007 dose levels in Part A  were between 0.5 and 40 mg/kg. Dose levels in subsequent parts of 
the study are based on the safety and PK results  (and galactitol re sults in Part s D, E, and E 
Extension  only)  of previous cohorts and/or previous parts of the study. Doses higher than 
40 mg/kg may be evaluated if the human C max and AUC are substantially lower than the 
corresponding values calculated in nonclinical experim ents and no dose limiting toxicity is 
observed up to and including at the 40 mg/kg dose. If dose escalation above 40 mg/kg is feasible 
based on the above criteria, these higher doses may be investigated in additional SAD and MAD 
cohorts in healthy subjects and in subjects with CG or GALK -deficient  Galactosemia if no 
AT-007 levels are detected in the CSF collected from the healthy subjects enrolled in Cohort  C3. 
All doses of study drug (AT -007 or placebo) should  be taken in the morning under fasting 
conditions (after at least a [ADDRESS_862248]  that is broken 2 hours after dosing [mandatory 
for doses with PK sampli ng time points and recommended for all other doses] ). This will be the 
case regardless of whether the study drug dose is taken at the CRU or at home.  
3.3.1.  Part A: Double -blind Single Ascending Dose (SAD) in Healthy Subject s 
Four dose levels were initially plann ed for the SAD group  and a fifth dose level was recently  
added  and completed  (Table  2). Subjects were  enrolled in 5 sequential cohorts of 8 subjects each, 
for a total of 40 subjects. The initial dose level was 0.5 mg/kg based on nonclinical study results 
(Section  1.4). The first cohort included a sentinel group (first 2  subjects with 1 per treatment)  
dosed at the same time . Dose administration for the remainder of the first cohort occur red only at 
least 24 hours after the 2 sentinel subjects receive d study drug (AT -007 or placebo) and were  
contingent upon acceptable safety results through [ADDRESS_862249] 48 hours after dosing. Subjects 
return ed for the EOS  Visit at 28 days after the dose. Progression to and the dose level for the 
next cohort were dependent upon safety data through Day 3  from the previous cohort. The 
Schedule of Assessments for Part A is provided in Appendix  A. Maximum duration of study 
participation (Screening through  EOS Visit) for an individual subject was approximately 
56 days.

3.3.2.  Part B: Double -blind Mult iple Ascending Dose (MAD) in Healthy Subject s  
Four dose levels are planned for the MAD group in Part B (Table  3). Subjects will be enrolled in 
4 sequential  cohorts of 6 or 8 subjects each, for a total of 28 subjects. The initial dose level for 
Part B (5 mg/kg) was based on the results from Part A  Cohorts A1 through A4 . Subjects will 
receive study drug (AT -007 or placebo) QD for 7 consecutive days. Subjects will be housed at 
the CRU  for observation from Day -1 (day before  the first dose) through  at least [ADDRESS_862250] dose . Prog ression to 
and the dose level for the next cohort will be dependent upon safety data through Day 8 from the 
previous cohort  as well as results from Part A . The Schedule of Assessments for Part  B is 
provided in Appendix  B. Maximum duration of study participation (Screening through EOS 
Visit) for an individual subject will be approximately 6 3 days.

Subjects  with Classic  Galactosemia  (CG)  
Three dose levels are planned for the subjects with CG ( Table  5). Subjects will be enrolled in 
3 sequential cohorts of 6 subjects each for a total of up to 18 subjects. The initial dose level for 
Part D was based on the results from Cohorts A1 through A4  and Cohorts B1 and B2 . Subjects 
will receive study drug (AT -007 or placebo) on Day [ADDRESS_862253] a 5 -day washout period (Day 1 po stdose 
through Day 6 predose).  Then, s ubjects who tolerated the single dose will take the same study 
drug QD for 27 consecutive days  (Day 6 through Day 32, inclusive) for the multiple dosing 
portion of Part D. (Note: For each individual subject, the Invest igator and the Sponsor will 
decide whether the subject can start the multiple dosing portion of Part D. The Investigator 
must consult the Sponsor. Starting the multiple dosing portion requires explicit agreement 
from the Sponsor. ) In the 27-day multiple do sing portion, s ubjects will take most of their doses 
at home ( fasting conditions [ Section  5.3] recommended ). Subjects will return to the site for brief 
in-clinic stays after the first week  of multiple dosing and at the end of multiple dosing as 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments for Part D (Appendix  D). Subjects will return for the 
EOS Visit at [ADDRESS_862254] single dose PK and galactitol results from the previous cohort  as well as 
additional Part B  (and possibly Part C)  results .  
The Schedule of Assessments for Part D is provided in Appendix  D. Maximum duration of study 
participation (Screening through EOS Visit) for an individual subject will be approximately 
100 days.

with study drug (placebo or AT -007) in a cohort may be randomized to treatment in another cohort (separate 
consent required) within the same Part  (assuming no safety or tolerability issues in the prior cohort) as long as 
there is a washout period ≥[ADDRESS_862256] the dose levels actually tested in completed Cohorts D1 and D2. The dose level for 
Cohort D3 is TBD as of the writing of protocol version 5.0. 
3.3.5.  Part E: Single Ascending Dose (SAD)  and Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD ) in 
Subjects with  GALK -deficient  Galactosemia  
The starting  dose level  for subjects with GALK -deficient  Galactosemia will be the most 
clinically appropriate dose as determined by [CONTACT_644184], tolerability, and PD 
(reduction in galactitol level) in Part D  cohorts completed at the time of starting Part E (Table  6). 
If needed, add itional dose levels may be tested in additional cohorts. If applicable, dose levels for 
subsequent cohorts in Part E will be based on safety data through Day [ADDRESS_862257] single dose 
PK and galactitol results from the previous cohort(s) in Part E  and po ssibly additional cohorts in 
Part D . 
Subjects will receive study drug (AT -007 or placebo) on Day [ADDRESS_862258] a 5 -day washout period (Day 1 
postdose through Day 6 predose). Then , subjects who tolerated the single dose will take the same 
study drug QD for 27  consecutive days (Day 6 through Day 32, inclusive) for the multiple 
dosing portion of Part E. (Note: For each individual subject, the Investigator and the 
Sponsor will decide whether the subject can start the multiple dosing portion of Part E. 
The Investigator must consult the Sponsor. Starting the multiple dosing portion requires 
explicit agreement from the Sponsor. ) In the multiple dosing portion, subjects will take most 
of their doses at home (fasting conditions [ Section  5.3] recommended). Subjects will return to 
the site for brief in -clinic stays after the first week of m ultiple dosing and at the end of multiple 
dosing as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments for Part E  (Appendix  E). Subjects will return 
for the EOS  Visit at [ADDRESS_862259] dose.  
The Schedule of Assessments for Part E is provided in Appendix  E. Maximum duration of study 
participation (Scre ening through EOS Visit) for an individual subject will be approximately 
100 days.

3.3.6.  Part D Extension : 90-Day Dosing  in Subjects with Classic  Galactosemia  
The Part D Extension is open to the following subjects:  
• Subjects who completed Part D may start in the extension at any time after the EOS 
Visit in Part D.  
• Subjects who participated in but discontinued Part D for reasons other than study 
drug related TEAE (and completed an EOS Visit at any time >[ADDRESS_862263] 
dose) may start in the extension at any time after the EOS Visit in Part D.  
• Subjects who participated in but discontinued Part D for reasons other than study 
drug related TEAE (and who either did not have an EOS Visit or had an EOS Visit 
before [ADDRESS_862264] dose) may start in the extension at any time beyond 
[ADDRESS_862265] dose in Part D.  
• De novo subjects who did not participate in Part D may participate in the [ADDRESS_862266] cohort of the Part D Extension (DE1) will be 20 mg/kg/day ba sed on 
acceptable SAD and MAD safety and PK data from Cohort D2. After SRC review of all SAD 
and MAD data and Sponsor review of PK and gala ctitol data for Cohorts D1 through D3, a 
second cohort of the Part D Extension (DE2) may be initiated to evaluate a dose >20 mg/kg/day 
if this dose was well tolerated in the SAD and MAD portions of the study in both healthy 
volunteers and subjects with CG.   
A screening visit is required for de novo subjects and subjects whose last visit in Part D was 
>60 days before Day 1 in the Part D Extension.  The de novo subjects may also participate in 
optional prescreening.  
Within each cohort of up to 28 subjects, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 to AT -007 
and placebo. Subjects will receive study drug (AT -007 or placebo) on Day [ADDRESS_862267] dose. Subjects will receive 1 daily dose of the same study 
drug (AT -007 or placebo) for a total of [ADDRESS_862268] of their doses at home (fasting conditions [ Section  5.3] reco mmended). Subjects will have  
Protocol AT -007-[ADDRESS_862269] 
dose, and home health or in -clinic  visits at Months 1 and 2 as indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments for Part D Extension  (Appendix  F). At any time during Part D Extension, an 
interview with t he patient  and car egiver (when appropriate) will be performed to assess the 
impact of disease. (detailed processes described in a separate Interview Guide).  Subjects will 
return for the EO E Visit at [ADDRESS_862270] s who transition to a separate Open -Label Extenstion Study. For these subjects the EOE 
will be Day 91.  
The Schedule of Assessments for Part D Extension  is provided in Appendix  F. Maximum 
duration of study participation (Screening through EO E Visit) for an individual subject will be 
approximately [ADDRESS_862271] who was 
screened for Part D, completed Part D, and completed Part D Extension without requiring a 
screening visit for the Part D Extension  and without counting any washout period between 
Part D and Part D Extension.

number of subjects may increase if doses abo ve 40 mg/kg  are tested in additional cohorts (see Section  1.4). The 
overall number of subjects per cohort may be increased to address any potential lost -to-follow -up among subjects 
treated with either placebo or AT -007. 
3.4. Safety Review Committee (SRC)  
An SRC consisting of the Principal Investigator(s) or designee (e.g., a medically qualified 
sub-investigator), the pharmacokineticist, and Sponsor (including external co nsultants) will meet 
and review  the safety data from each cohort in each part of the study. Study progression  to the 
next cohort  (within each part of the study) will occur only after review of the safety data through 
Day 3 in Part A, Day 8 in Parts B and C, and Day 12 in Part s D and E. 
Safety data to be assessed prior to each dose escalation  decision within a part of the study 
includ e but are not limited to the following:  
• AEs (including dose -limiting toxicities [DLTs], see Section  3.5) 
• Clinical safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis)  
• Physical examinations  
• Vital signs  
• ECGs

Page 39 of 120 In addition , PK data for AT -007 wil l be considered  during all parts of the study . PK data will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_644185]. Safety and PK data from Cohorts A1 through A4  
in Part  A were  evaluated by [CONTACT_12217] (safety) and Sponsor (PK)  before Part  B (MAD) was 
allowed to start . Safety and PK data from Cohorts A1 through A4  in Part  A and Cohorts B1 and 
B2 were  evaluated before Cohort C1 (MAD with lumbar puncture)  or Cohort D1 (subjects with 
CG) were allowed to start. Safety and PK data from these cohorts plus Cohort  D2 (and possibly 
Cohorts A5, B4, and D3, depending on timing ) will be evaluated before  Cohort E 1 (subjects with 
GALK -deficient  Galactosemia ) will be allowed to start. (Notes: Cohor t A5 [40 mg/kg] was 
added as part of the amendment resulting in protocol version 4.0  and completed before the 
writing of protocol version 5.0 . Addition of Cohort A5 resulted in the addition of Cohort C3 [as 
part of the same protocol amendment that added Co hort A5] and will result in Cohorts B4 and 
D3 [both not yet used  as of the writing of protocol version 5.0] being conducted .) Safety and PK 
data from Cohort  D2 were evaluated before deciding the dose (20  mg/kg) for Cohort DE1.  
The review of the PK data fr om Cohorts A1 through A4  and the first 2 cohorts of Part B 
confirm ed that once daily (QD) dosing is adequate.  
Safety and PK data from Cohorts A1 through A4  and Cohorts B1, B2, and B3  were  evaluated 
before Cohort C2 (MAD with lumbar puncture) was allowed to start.  
Safety and PK data from Cohorts A1 through A5 , Cohorts B1 through B 3, and Cohorts C1 and 
C2 were  evaluated before deciding to start Cohorts B4 and  C3 (MAD with lumbar puncture) 
simultaneously at the same dose (40 mg/kg) .  
Safety and PK data from Cohorts A1 through A4  and Cohorts B1 and B2  were  evaluated before 
Part D (SAD  and MAD in subjects with CG)  was allowed to start. In addition to safety data 
through Day [ADDRESS_862273] single dose PK and galactitol results from the previous cohort(s) 
within Part  D and safety and PK data from Cohort B3 were  evaluated before Cohort D2 was 
allowed to start . Safety and PK data from Cohort B4  will be evaluated before Cohort D3 will be 
allowed to start.  
Safety data through Day [ADDRESS_862274] single dose PK and galactitol results from all completed 
cohorts within Part  D (at least Cohorts D1 and D2 [possibly Cohort D3, depending on timing]) 
will be evaluated before Coho rt E1 will be allowed to start.  The starting dose for Part E will not 
be higher than the highest acceptable dose in Part D at the time that Part E starts. In case of 
multiple cohorts in Part E, safety data through Day [ADDRESS_862275] single dose PK and gal actitol 
results from previous cohort(s) within Part  E will be evaluated before subsequent cohorts in 
Part E will be allowed to start.  
Safety and PK data from Cohort D2 were evaluated before deciding the dose (20 mg/kg) for 
Cohort DE1  (Part D Extension).  In case of a second cohort in the Part D Extension, s afety data 
through Day [ADDRESS_862276] single dose PK and galactitol results from all completed cohorts 
within Part  D (including Cohort D3)  and safety and PK data for Cohorts  A5 and B4 will be 
evaluated before deciding upon a dose.  
At each dose escalation decision, the SRC will recommend proceeding or not proceeding to the 
next cohort as well as the dose level for AT -007. The AT -007 dose level may be increased, 
decreased, or repeated  from one cohort to the next.

3.5. Dose Escalation/De -escalation  
For Parts A, B, and C of the study (healthy subjects), safety and drug exposure will determine 
escalation or de -escalation. If the initial dose tested in Part A had not been  well tolerated, the 
Sponsor may have choose n to de -escalate until a well -tolerated dose was identified. A careful 
analysis of available safety, laboratory evaluation, and drug PK  data in healthy subjects  was done 
to determine the starting dose for Part D in subjects with CG . A careful analysis of available 
safety, laboratory evaluation, and drug PK data in subjects with CG will determine the starting 
dose for  Part E in subjects with GALK -deficient  Galactos emia . The starting dose in Part E will 
not be higher than the highest acceptable dose used in Part D at the time of starting Part E.  The 
starting dose in Part D Extension will be 20 mg/kg based on acceptable SAD and MAD safety 
and PK data from Cohort D2 . 
For Part D of the study (subjects with CG), safety , drug exposure , and biomarker analysis of 
galactitol  will determine escalation or de -escalation. If the drug exposure in subjects with CG is 
similar to that seen in healthy subjects in Part A, the same or s imilar  approach to dose escalation  
may be utilized. If there is any concern of altered drug exposure or drug clearance based on PK 
analysis after the single dose in the initial cohort of Part D, then alternative dose escalation to 
lower levels may be selec ted until the relationship between dose and exposure in subjects with 
CG is determined. Dose escalation may be stopped if an effect on galactitol (reduction in 
galactitol) is achieved, but it becomes apparent that higher drug exposure is not increasing 
reduction of galactitol or providing any additional benefit. If any tested dose is not well tolerated

Applied Therapeutics Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  3 September  2021 
Page 42 of 120 while markedly reducing galactitol levels, lower dose levels may be tested until no/minimal 
reduction in galactitol levels is detected.  
In case of multiple c ohorts in  Parts E, the dose escalation process will be the same as for Part D . 
A second cohort of the Part D Extension (DE2) may be initiated to evaluate a dose higher than 
20 mg/kg/day if this dose was well tolerated in the SAD and MAD portions of the stu dy in both 
healthy volunteers and subjects with CG . 
The SRC will make recommendations to the Sponsor regarding dose escalation or de -escalation 
for each cohort based on the results from the previous cohort as described in Section  3.4. The 
Sponsor will act upon this recommendation and inform the Investigator(s) and the IRB(s) /IEC(s) .  
The SRC will pay particular attention to DLTs d efined as any AT -007-related AE or clinically 
relevant finding on laboratory tests, ECGs, vital signs, or physical examinations that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_3755]/or the SRC, precludes administering the dose to any subject 
and/or continuing to ad minister daily doses to the subject who experienced the event. Specific 
individual subject -level dose stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_644151]  G and Appendix  H. For DLTs, as well as fatal serious adverse events ( SAEs ) and 
life-threatening SAEs, breaking the blind will be considered and initiated (as needed) per SRC 
discussion and agreement .  
Dose -escalation will be stopped and de -escalation initiated if:  
• ≥2 subjects on AT -007 (B and C cohorts of the same dose level considered together) 
experience a DLT  at any time through [ADDRESS_862277] dose of study treatment  
• Any subject on AT -[ADDRESS_862278] dose of study treatment  
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be th e dose level below the dose level at which one or 
more of the events listed above occurs.  
Dose escalation within each part of the study will continue until the MTD is identified per the 
rules described earlier in this section  or the SRC and/or Sponsor deci de to stop dose escalation . 
Dose de -escalation, if initiated within any part of the study, will continue until the MTD is 
identified or the SRC and/or Sponsor decide to stop.  
If the events  outlined in the above MTD definition  do not occur at any dose level  in a study part, 
then the MTD will be the highest dose level in that study part.   
If the events outlined in the above MTD definition occur at a ny given  dose level, the Sponsor 
may decide to investigate a dose higher that the previously well -tolerated dose  but lower than the 
dose at which one of the events outlined in the above MTD definition occurred.  
3.6. Study Termination  
The study will be terminat ed if the MTD is associated with insufficient drug exposure.  
The study may be discontinued for any clinically sig nificant changes, or pattern of changes (for 
example, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities) , that are judged by [CONTACT_222528]/or Sponsor to be related to the study drug and represent a major tolerability concern.

manual.  Dosing will be weight based. AT -007 (or matching placebo) will be taken orally, QD, 
under fasted conditions.  Doses will be rounded according to the available stock keepi[INVESTIGATOR_644153] 
(SKU ) as described in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Retention samples of investigational AT -007 will not be required. At the conclusion of the study, 
any unused study drug will be returned to the Sponsor or destroyed by [CONTACT_644195]/local  regulations.  
5.2. Study Drug Assignment and Blinding  
Up to 116 subjects are planned to be dosed in this study:  
• Part A: 5 cohorts of 8 healthy subjects each  
• Part B: 2 cohorts of 6 healthy subjects each and 2 cohorts of 8 healthy subjects each  
• Part C: 3 cohorts of 4 healthy subjects each  
• Part D: 3 cohorts of 6 subjects with CG  each 
• Part E: 1 to 3 cohort s of 6 subjects with GALK -deficient  Galactosemia  each 
• Part D Extension: 1 to 2 cohorts with a combined total of 28 subjects with CG  
Note: The number of cohorts and total number of subjects may increase if doses abo ve 40 mg/kg 
are tested in additional cohorts (see Section  1.4). In Parts D and E, the overall number of subjects 
per cohort may be increased up to [ADDRESS_862319] -to-follow -up among 
subjects treated with either placebo or AT -007. In Parts D and E, subjects treated with study drug 
(placebo or AT -007) in a cohort may be randomized to treatment in another cohort (separate 
consent required) within the same Part  (assuming no safety or tolerability issues in the prior 
Protocol AT -007-1001 V ersion 10.0 
Applied Therapeutics Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  3 September  2021 
Page 54 of 120 cohort) as long as there is a washout period ≥[ADDRESS_862320] dose in the next cohort . Both de novo and Part D subjects with CG may participate in 
Part D Extension (separate consent required) (see Section  3.3.[ADDRESS_862321] can start study drug in the Part  D Extension).  
In Parts A, B, D,  E, and D Extension , subjects will b e randomized to receive either active drug 
(AT-007) or placebo (see Section  3.3 for the number of subjects to be randomized to each 
treatment within each  cohort ). Each subject will receive an assigned treatment based on the 
randomization schedule prepared by [CONTACT_4305].  
Parts A and B will be double -blinded (the Sponsor /CRO , clinical site  staff [except for unblinded 
pharmacist for Parts A and B],  and the subjects will not know which subjects  are treated with 
AT-007 or placebo).  
In Part C, all subjects will be assigned to receive active drug (AT -007). Part C will be open -label.  
In Part s D, E, and D Extension , the clinical site staff (except for the unblinded pharmacist ) and 
the subjects will be blinded to study treatment. The Sponsor /CRO  will not be blinded to study 
treatment  because  the relationship between exposure in Parts D, E, and D Ext ension  (subjec ts 
with galactosemia ) vs. exposure in healthy subjects  will need to be evaluated on an ogoing basis 
to ensure that AT -[ADDRESS_862322] s with galacto semia  potentially exposed to plasma concentrations 
of AT -007 not previously tested and shown to be safe in healthy subjects . 
5.3. Study Drug Administration  
For Part s A, B, and C, subjects will take the study drug (oral capsules of AT -007 or placebo) in 
the CRU under the supervision of study personnel . Study staff will conduct a hand and mouth 
check immediately after dose to ensure that the medication has been appropriately swallowed.  
For Parts D and E, study drug was oral capsules of AT -[ADDRESS_862323]  study drug doses in Part s D, E, and 
D Extension  will be taken on an out -patient basis (i.e., at home).  Each s ubject will be provided 
with a di ary card to record the dates/times for all doses taken at home . 
Study drug dose is in mg/kg. For each subject, body weight at screening will be used to 
determine the amount (mg) of study drug in each dose.  
All doses of study drug should be taken under fast ing conditions. Subjects should  take all doses 
of study drug in the morning (with water) after overnight fasts of at least [ADDRESS_862324] at any time ≥ [ADDRESS_862325] doses at home . Treatment compliance will be determined by 
[CONTACT_644196] (or otherwise measuring study drug dispensed to  Part D Extension  subjects 
taking the liquid suspension ) dispensed and collected at each of these visits  and by [CONTACT_348292]’ study drug diary cards . 
5.5. Fasting/Meals/Beverages  
During the stays in the CRU, subjects’ meals and beverages will adhere to the study restrictions 
(Section  4.6). In addition, subjects will be fasted overnight for at least [ADDRESS_862326] will be broken at ≥2 hours 
after the dose.  
During the out -patien t periods of the study, it is recommended that subjects take the study drug 
under the same fasting conditions. Subjects/caregivers will be instructed to have the subject fast 
overnight for at least [ADDRESS_862327] at ≥2 hours after the dose. Subjects/caregivers will also be 
instructed to adhere to the study restrictions ( Section  4.6) and report any lapses.  
Throughout the study, healthy subjects will maintain their normal/usual diet.  
Throughout the study, subjects wi th CG or GALK -deficient  Galactosemia  will maintain their 
normal/usual galactose -restricted diet that elimin ates sources of galactose from dairy products 
but permits minimal dietary intake of galactose from non -dairy products.  
Subjects will be encouraged to drink water ad libitum.

provided in Appendix  A, Appendix  B, Appendix  C, Appendix  D, Appendix  E, and Appendix  F, 
respectively.  
The Screening Visit  and EOS (or EOE) Visit can be done at any time of day , but the subject 
should arrive in a fasted state after fasting for at least [ADDRESS_862328] should not take study 
drug before arriving at the CRU because study drug will be administered at the visit  as needed . 
For the arrival times and conditions of all other visits, please refer to the Schedules of 
Assessments for Parts A, B, C, D, E, and D Extension  (Appendix  A, Appendix  B, Appendix  C, 
Appendix  D, Appendix  E, and Appendix  F, respectively). If nothing is stated explicitly regarding 
arrival time , whether the subject should be in a fasted state, and/or whether the subject should 
have taken study drug or not, then assume that the subject can arrive at any time, fasted vs fed 
does not matter, and/or the subject should have taken study drug at home ( if during a dosing 
period).  
For each visit, the visit procedures are listed in the approximate order in which they should be 
performed. However, the order of some procedures may be changed for practical reasons (when 
the subject arrives relative to the pl anned time of dosing and when the subject is able to produce 
a urine sample) as long as the procedures are done within the required timeframe and under the 
required conditions (fasting vs non -fasting and/or before vs after the dose). For example, fasting 
blood and urine samples for clinical safety laboratories are usually written as occurring after the 
dose because of the importance of the timing of the dose; however, the fasting safety laboratory 
samples may be taken at any time before the subject breaks t he fast after the dose.  
Acceptable windows for visit procedures are provided in the footnotes in the Schedules of 
Assessments.  In case of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_644154], meeting the nominal time point for study drug 
dosing and collecting blood samples for PK and /or biomarkers take priority over meeting the 
nominal time point ECGs and vital signs which take priority over meeting the nominal time point 
for physical examinations and collecting samples for clinical safety laboratory tests.  
NOTE: If extenuating circum stances (i.e., COVID -19 pandemic) make clinic visits 
inadvisable/impractical/unwanted for subjects, study visits will be done as home visits by a 
visiting nurse with some equipment/supplies sent to the subjects’ home for the duration of 
their study partici pation . The details regarding these home health visits are described in a 
separate document entitled “ Work Instructions for Conduct of Home Health Protocol 
Visit(s) during COVID -19 Pandemic ”. 
6.1. Prescreening Period (De novo Part D Extension Subjects Only)  
Prescreening can be done at any time during a home health visit (in -clinic visit also permitted). 
The purpose of prescreening is to identify subjec ts who may be interested in and qualify for the 
study. A prescreening ICF must be completed before any study -specific prescreening procedure 
is conducted.  
Protocol AT -007-1001 V ersion 10.0

Page 82 of 120 8. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Subjects will be monitored for AEs from the signing of informed consent  through  the EOS  (or 
EOE) Visit. The Investigator or a medically qualified designee will review each event. The 
Investigator or designee  will assess its relationship to the study drug. Each AE will be graded for 
severity, and the date and time of onset  and cessation  will be recorded  along with any treatment 
given for the AE and any action taken with regard to the study drug.  Treatment of any AE will be 
evaluated and managed by a physician, either at the study site or at a nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_644156], as appropriate. The AE resolution  or outcome  will be recorded. All non -serious 
AEs will be reported on a regular basis or as specified by [CONTACT_1034].  
8.1. Definitions  
8.1.1.  Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whe ther or not considered drug related.  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without judgment to causality. 
An AE can arise from any use of t he drug (e.g., off -label, use in combinations with another drug) 
and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. AEs may 
include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre -existing conditions. New signs and 
symp toms of underlying disease, or signs and symptoms of emerging disease must be recorded 
as AEs.  
The Investigator /designee  should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the di agnosis should be documented 
as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  
8.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A SAE is an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (i.e., a subject is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event, 
not an event where occurrence in a more severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomal y or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require a 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
Examples of “important medical events” that are SAEs  include allergic bronchospasm  requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home , blood dyscrasias , or convulsions that do 
not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
Protocol AT -007-1001 V ersion 10.0 
Applied Therapeutics Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  3 September  2021 
Page 83 of 120 The term "severe" is often used to describe the severity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, 
or severe); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as 
severe headache). This is not the same as "serious," which is based on subject/event outcome or 
action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat t o a subject's life or functioning  as 
defined by [CONTACT_29967].   
During the study, if a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e .g., elective surgery) that was 
scheduled before the study entry (i .e., before informed consent for an event/condition that 
occurred before the study), then the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29919] a therapeutic intervention and 
not the result of a SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it should be 
reported as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results  in a serious outcome such as 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
8.1.3.  Expectedness  
An AE is considered “unexpected ” if the AE is not listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not 
listed with the observed specificity or severity.  
8.2. AE Reporting  
All AEs must be coll ected and recorded in the subject’s study records/source documents, in 
accordance with the Investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on the CRF.  
Each AE will be evaluated by [CONTACT_644202]  (onset/cessation) , 
severity, causal r elationship to the study drug, seriousness, action taken with the study drug, and 
resolution or outcome. Treatment given for an AE should be recorded as a concomitant 
medication with the AE as the indication for the treatment. Definitions for severity and causal 
relationship to the study drug are presented in Section  8.2.1  and Section  8.2.2 , respectively . The 
definition for serious is provided in Section  8.1.2 . 
8.2.1.  AE Severity  
The Investigator or designee will assess the severity of each AE according to the following 
definitions:  
• Mild - Transient symptoms that do not influence performance of the subject’s daily 
activities. Other treatment is not indicated.  
• Moderate - Marked symptoms sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable. 
Moderate influence on performance of the subject’s daily activities. Other treatment 
may be necessary.  
• Severe - Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Sub stantial influence on subject’s 
daily activities. May be unable to continue the study, and other treatment may be 
necessary.

Applied Therapeutics Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  3 September  2021 
Page 84 of 120 8.2.2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator or designee will assess the relationship of each AE to study drug using his/her 
clinical judgment and according to the following definitions:  
• Probably Related: An adverse event that is probably related to the use of the drug  
• Possibly Related: An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. An 
alternative explanation  (e.g., conc omitant drug, concomitant disease ) is inconclusive. 
The relationship in time is reasonable; therefore, the casual relationship cannot be 
excluded.  
• Unlikely Related: An adverse event that might not be due to the use of the drug. An 
adverse event for which a n alternative explanation (e.g., concomitant drug, 
concomitant disease) is more likely  or the relationship in time suggests that a causal 
relationship is unlikely.  
• Not Related: An adverse event that is not related to the use of the drug.  
For the purposes o f regulatory reporting, a casuality of probably or possibly related will be 
mapped to related, while a causality of unlikely or not related will be mapped to unrelated.  
8.3. SAE Reporting  
The Investigator or designee will notify the appropriate Sponsor contact [CONTACT_644203], observation, or report of occurrence (regardless of the relationship to study drug ).

Page 86 of 120 9. STATISTICS  
9.1. Sample Size Determination  
No formal sample size calculation is required. The appro ximate sample size (up to [ADDRESS_862377] participates in both , and  up to  
18 subjects with GALK -deficient  Galactosemia in Part E ) is not based on statistical 
considerations. The number of subjects is typi[INVESTIGATOR_323901] 1 studies of this type and is adequ ate 
to meet study objectives . 
Note: The number of cohorts and /or total number of subjects may increase if the PK data reveal 
an insufficient exposure at 40 mg/kg (see Section  1.4). In Parts D and E, the overall number of 
subjects per cohort may be increased up to [ADDRESS_862378] -to-follow -up 
among subjects treated with either placebo or AT -007. In Parts D and E, subjects treated with 
study drug ( placebo  or AT-007) in a cohort may be randomized to treatment in another cohort 
(separate consent required) within the same Part  (assuming subject had no safety or tolerability 
issues in the prior cohort) as long as there is a washout period ≥[ADDRESS_862379] to certain timing considerations (see 
Section  3.3.6 ), Part D subjects may also participa te in Part D Extension (separate consent 
required).  
9.2. Statistical Methods  
Detailed statistical methods will be provided in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) that will be 
finalized before database lock.  
NOTE: Part E  and Part D Extension  results might not be i ncluded in the CSR. If the Part E 
and/or Part D Extension results are not included in the CSR, they will be summarized and 
presented in a separate report  or CSR addendum . 
9.2.1.  General Considerations  
Safety measures including the baseline data will be summarized descriptively within each part 
(Parts A, B,  C, D, E, and D Extension ) of the study by [CONTACT_13155] (dose level of AT-007 and 
placebo), pooled AT-007 group, and pooled placebo group. Within each part of the study, PK 
data will be summarized by [CONTACT_50182]-007 dose group using descriptive statistics. In case of repeat 
cohorts, data from all cohorts of the same dose level will be combined for analysis.  
For continuous outcome s, descriptive statistics will include the number of subjects, mean, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the mean, standard deviation  (SD) , median, minimum  (Min) , 
maximum  (Max) , 25th percentile, and 75th percentile. For categorical outcomes, the number and 
percentage of subjects will be presented. Descriptive statistics will generally be presented by 
[CONTACT_50182]-group . For summaries of continuous AT-[ADDRESS_862380] nonmissing 
value prior to dosing will be used. Otherwise, missing observations will be treated as missing at

Page 87 of 120 random, and no data imputation will be performed. All data from the CRFs, as well as any 
derived variables, will be presented in data listings.  
SAS® version 9. 4 or later  will be used for all analyses.  
9.2.2.  Analysis Populations  
Two analysis populations will be def ined:  
• Safety population: The safety population will consist of all subjects who are 
randomized and receive at least 1 dose of study drug. All analyses will be performed 
according to treatment received. This population will be used for all analys es of 
safet y data.  
• Pharmacokinetic (PK) population: The PK population will consist of all subjects who 
receive at least [ADDRESS_862381], containing study drug dosing and dosing errors, if any, will be 
provided. Treatment compliance will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
9.2.5.  Important Protocol Deviations  
Important protocol deviations (IPDs) will be identified and documented based on a review of 
potential IPDs. The potential IPDs will be identified through programmatic checks of study data, 
as well as through review of selected data listings. The potential IPDs to be reviewed include, but 
are not limi ted to, subjects who:  
• Did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Received disallowed concomitant medication  
• Informed consent date obtained after date of first study procedure  
Additional IPDs may be identified from clinical review of Investigator /designee  comments or 
other data. Individual IPDs will be presented in a data listing.

Page 88 of 120 9.2.6.  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including age, sex, race, ethnicity, weight, height, and 
body mass index) will be summarized using  descriptive statistics. No formal statistical analyses 
will be performed.  
The medical history of all subjects as well as the neurological  history of subjects with CG  and 
subjects with GALK -deficient Galactosemia  will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) a nd 
preferred term (PT) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
version  22.0 or higher. The number and percentage of subjects with abnormal findings in each 
SOC and each PT will be summarized . 
9.2.7.  Safety Analyses  
The evaluation of safety will be based on the occurrence of treatment -emergent adverse events  
(TEAEs) ; discontinuations  from study drug and/or the study  because of AEs; clinical laboratory 
test results, physical examination findings, vital sign evaluations, and 12-lead ECGs  results. All 
safety endpoints will be summarized descriptively. No statistical inference will be applied to the 
safety endpoints. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative safety data and 
frequency counts will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_644157].  
AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_644204], version 22.0 or higher.  
TEAEs are defined as AEs with onset on or after the date/time of the first dose of study drug.  
Safety analyses will be described in detail in the SAP.  
9.2.8.  Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analyses  
PK calculations will be performed using appropriate software, e.g., Phoenix™ WinNonlin® 
(Version 6.3 or higher, Pharsight Corporation) and/or SAS® (Version 9.4 or higher, SAS Institute 
Inc.).  
PK parameters will be calculated usin g noncompartmental methods, using an appropriate model. 
Concentrations below the lower limit of quantitation (BLQ) will be treated as zero from the time 
of the first quantifiable concentration; embedded and terminal BLQ concentrations will be 
treated as “m issing.” Actual sample times, if available, will be used in the PK analysis.  
AT-007 concentration -time data and PK parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_427938] 
(dose level) using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum, perc ent 
coefficient of variation [CV%]).   
Dose proportionality, the proportionality of a change in systemic exposure with a change in dose, 
may be assessed using a power model or other appropriate methods.  
Details of the PK analyses, including any additional exploratory analyses, will be described in 
the SAP.  
9.2.9.  Biomarker Analyses  
For Part s D, E, and D Extension , blood and urine levels of galactose, galactitol, and its other 
metabolites will be summarized using descriptive statistics . Details of these analyses will be 
provided in the SAP .

CRU = clinical research unit; EOS = end -of-study; FSH = follicle -stimulating hormone; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; I/E = inclusion/exclusion; 
MAD  = multiple ascending dose; PK = pharmacokinetic; QD = once daily; SAD = single ascending dose.  
a: Subjects will arrive at the CRU in the morning on Day -1 (approximately [ADDRESS_862392] dose). For the Days  12, 20, and 32 check -ins/visits, 
the subjec t should arrive after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours (and before breaking the fast) and before taking study drug. On Days [ADDRESS_862393] any study drug in his/her possession and should arrive (in a fasted condition) in the mo rning (before the planned time of study drug dosing to 
be given in the clinic  on Day 6 [no study drug dosing on Day 60] ). 
b: Discharge from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd (last) in -clinic periods will occur on Days  3, 13, and 34, respectively, after all procedures for that day are done and the last 
blood sample or urine collection for that in -clinic period is collected.  
c: The EOS visit will be scheduled for 28 (±2) days after the last dose of study drug  in the MAD portion . 
d: All physical examinations will include weight; however, height will be measured only at screening.  
e: Vital signs will be measured at Screening, every check -in, every check -out, predose (within 60 min before the dose) and 4 hours (±10 minutes) after the d ose 
on Days 1, 6, 12, 20, and 32, once daily on all other in -clinic days, and at the EOS visit.  
f: Electrocardiograms will be performed at Screening, Day -1 check -in, predose (within 60 min before the dose) and 2 hours (±10 minutes) after the dose on 
Days 1, 6, 12, 20, and 32, and at the EOS visit.  
g:  Samples for clinical safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis) will be collected under fas ting conditions.  
h: Serum pregnancy tests at Screening, Day -1, and EOS visits; uri ne pregnancy tests at other time points. Also, female subjects claiming postmenopausal status 
will have that status verified with an FSH test at Screening. Once a female subject is verified as postmenopausal or otherwis e not of childbearing potential, 
the subject is exempt for further pregnancy tests.  On Days 6, 12, 20, and 32, the urine pregnancy test must be done (and the result negative) before study drug 
is administered.  
j: On Days 1, 6, 12, 13, 20, and 32, study drug will be administered at the clinic. All other doses of study drug will be taken at home QD with water in the 
morning (preferably after an overnight fast of ≥[ADDRESS_862394] broken ≥2 hours after the dose). Study drug administra tion shoul d be at approximately 
the same time of day (preferably 8 am) throughout the multiple dosing period s. See Section  6.7 for when study drug will be dispens ed and/or collected.  
k: The 5 -day washout between single and multiple dosing will start immediately after the Day 1 dose and end immediately before the Day  6 dose. There is no 
visit on Day 5; it is in the Schedule of Assessments only for depi[INVESTIGATOR_644159] 5 -day washout.  
l: For the Day 1 dose, blood samples for PK will be collected predose (within 60 minutes before the dose) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,  4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours 
(±5 minutes for all time points) after the dose. On Days [ADDRESS_862395] es for PK will be collected predose (within 60 minutes before the dose) and at 
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours ( ±5 minutes for all time points) after the dose. On Day 13, a blood sample for PK will be collected predose (i.e., at 24 hours 
±5 minutes a fter the Day 12 dose). On Day 33, blood samples for PK will be collected at 24 and 36 hours ( ±5 minutes for both time points) after the Day 32 
dose. On Day 34, a blood sample for PK will be collected at 48 hours ( ±5 minutes) after the Day 32 dose.

b: Screening visit for the Part D Extension is needed for subjects who have not previously participated in Part D. For subjects who previously pa rticipated in 
Part D, this Screening Visit is only needed if Day 1 of the extension period will be > [ADDRESS_862402] visit (EOS or otherwise) in Part D.  
c: Check -in will occur around [ADDRESS_862403] 10 hours (and before breaking the 
fast) and before taking study drug.  In lieu of overnight stays in the CRU, subjects may stay at a local hotel; subjects will abide by [CONTACT_644208].  The Day 3 0 and Day 60 visits can be either home health or in -clinic visits.  
d: Discharge from the in -clinic stay will occur after all procedures for that day are done and the subject has stayed in the clinic for at least [ADDRESS_862404] 
dose.  
e: The EOE visit will be scheduled for 28 (±2) days after the last dose of study drug . The EOE Visit will not be required if subjects transition to the separate 
Open -Label Extenstion Study, in which case the study completion will be considered the completion of t he Treatment Period at Day 91.  
f: The informed consent form needs to be signed at the first visit for the extension which may be either the Screening visit or the Day -1 check -in (see 
footnote  b). 
g: All physical examinations will include weight; however, height will be measured only at screening (or prescreening ). Prescreening does not include a physical 
examination (only height and weight).  
h: Vital signs will be measured at Screening (if applicable), every check -in, every check -out, predose (within 60 mi n before the dose) and 4 hours (±10 minutes) 
after the dose on Days 1, 30, 60, and 90 , once daily on all other visits,  and at the EOE visit.  
i: Electrocardiograms will be performed at Screening (if applicable), Day -1 check -in, predose (within 60 min before the dose) and 2 hours (±10 minutes) after 
the dose on Days 1, 30, 60, and 90 , and at the EOE visit.  
j:  Samples for clinical safety laboratory  tests (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis , UACR and UPCR ) will be collected under fasting conditions. At 
the Screening visit only (i.e., only applicable to subjects for whom this visit is required  and does not need to be repeated at screening if already done at 
prescreening ), HIV and hepatitis B & C testing will also be done.  Hematology, chemistry, and coagulation at the Screening visit (i.e., only applicable to 
subjects for whom this visit is required ) does not need to be repeated if already d one at prescreening and prescreening was within [ADDRESS_862405] dose 
of Part D Extension study drug.  Clinical safety  laboratory tests (h ematology, chemistry, coagulation , urinalysis , UACR and UPCR)  do not need to be repeated 
at Day -1 if already d one at prescreening or screening and the prescreening/screening visit was done within [ADDRESS_862406] dose of Part D Extension 
study drug.  
k: Serum pregnancy tests will be done at Screening (if applicable), Day -1 (also urine test if serum test ca nnot be processed immediately), and EOE visits; urine 
pregnancy tests will be done at all other time points. From Days [ADDRESS_862407] be done (and the result n egative) on dosing days before 
study drug is administered.  A pregnancy test m ust be performed on Day -1 even if already performed earlier during the screening period .  
m: On Days 1 , 2, and 90, study drug will be administered at the clinic. On Days 30 and 60, study drug will be administered during the visit (home health or in -
clinic ), All other doses of study drug will be taken at home QD with water in the morning (preferably after an overnight fast of ≥[ADDRESS_862408] broken 
≥2 hours after the dose). Study drug administration should be at approximately the same time of day (preferably 8 am) throughout the extension. Drug 
accountability (including dispensing and/or collecting) will be assessed at all visits during the 90 days of dosing.   
n: On Day  1, a predose (within 60 minutes before the dose) blood sample for PK will be co llected. On Days 30, 60, and 90,  blood samples for PK will be 
collected predose ( 24 hours [±15 minutes] after the dose taken the day before and within 60  minutes before the dose  administered on that day ) and at  2, 4, 8, 
and 12  hours (±5 minutes  for all tim e points ) after the dose. An additional sample will be taken on Day 91 at 24 hour after the Day 90 dose.  
o: With the exception of the blood sample for biomarkers taken Screening  (for those subjects requiring a screening visit) , the time points and allowabl e windows 
for the blood samples for biomarkers will match those for the blood samples for PK.

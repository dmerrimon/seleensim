 I. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND BACKGROUND 
A. Purpose of the Study  
The proposed study “Patient -Centered Stomach Cancer Prevention in Chinese Americans” aims to assess 
the efficacy, adoption, and impact of an integrated intervention to improve adherence to recommended 
stomach cancer prevention guidelines ( H. pylori test -and- treat) for at -risk Chinese Americans in NYC. 
The integrated multifaceted theory -based intervention involves: 1) a health systems- level intervention 
using electronic health record (EHR) -based tools to facilitate H. pylori test-and- treat strategies; and 2) a 
community-engaged culturally and linguistically adapted community health worker (CHW)- led patient 
navigation program we are currently pi[INVESTIGATOR_792556]. Using a 2 -arm 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, we will enroll 144 Chinese American patients across NYC health care facilities (NYU Langone Health – which includes NYU Langone Brooklyn, NYU Langone Brooklyn Family Health Centers and affiliated provider practices, and NYU Ambulatory Care Centers – 
Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792557]). The integrated intervention involves:  
1. A collaboratively developed and refined EHR-based clinical decision support system and 
CHW -led culturally  and linguistically  adapted  stomach  cancer  prevention program  for the 
Chinese American  community.  
2. A H. pylori test-and- treat intervention  using linked  EHR  tools with a CHW -led culturally  and 
linguistically adapted program to improve H. pylori eradication and treatment among 
vulnerable Chinese American  patients.  
 
In addition, using a mixed- methods approach and the RE -AIM framework,1 we aim to systematically 
assess the implementation process and delineate factors that influence feasibility, acceptability, adoption, sustainability and scalability of a combined EHR -CHW strategy within safety nethealth care systems.  
This will be achieved through the completion of: 
1. Assessment of utilization patterns through extracted MCIT  files.  
2. Qualitative key informant interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_792581] (1- 3 at each site), and adm inistrator (1 -2 at each site), and the CHWs (1 at each site). 
At baseline, the interviews will be incorporated into the workflow analysis to assess current 
satisfaction and EHR usage and health coaching. At follow -up, the interviews will assess 
barriers an d facilitators to the implementation and adoption process of the integrated EHR - 
CHW intervention, intervention fidelity, and to solicit recommendations for the replication and 
scalability of the intervention to other clinical sites.  
3. Ethnographic data will be collected  by [CONTACT_792582]  [ADDRESS_1092656] :
 The proposed study will inform efforts to prevent stomach cancer and reduce the burden of 
stomach cancer in Chinese American communities served in safety net health systems and establish a 
reproducible, sustainable patient -centered cancer prevention model integrated within health care systems 
serving vulnerable communities.  
 
Subs
tudy : The proposed substudy aims to evaluate the feasibility and response rate for the collection of 
biosamples among Chinese Americans with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of H. pylori . The biosamples 
will be used to assess differences in oral and gut microbiome profiles before and afte r H. pylori  antibiotic 
therapy. This will be achieved through the optional collection of oral and/or fecal biosamples from 
participants in EHR -CHW Intervention component of the study ‘Patient- Centered Stomach Cancer 
Prevention in Chinese Americans’. The proposed substudy will inform efforts to develop novel 
[ADDRESS_1092657] common cause of cancer death worldwide (723,000 deaths annually).2 Approximately 42% 
of new cases of stomach cancer worldwide occur in China.[ADDRESS_1092658] twice that of whites in NYC (15.5 vs. 8.1 per 100,000).[ADDRESS_1092659] common bacterial infections with approximately 50% of the global population 
infected.10,11 In 1994, the International Agency for Researc h on Cancer classified H. pylori as a Grade I 
carcinogen in humans.12 Approximately 89% of non- cardia gastric adenocarcinomas can be attributed to  
H. pylori infection.13,[ADDRESS_1092660] Asian populations, including Chinese, H pylori infection rates can be as 
high as 47-70%.15-[ADDRESS_1092661] Asian -born population that informs our proposal, found higher seroprevalence, 70.1% 
compared to other NYC groups (<20% seroprevalence), with higher r ates reported for recent Chinese 
immigrants.18 
 
B3. Chinese Americans, a vulnerable health disparity population. In NYC, the population of Chinese Americans is approximately 574,886: 72% are foreign-born, 34% lack a high school diploma, 61% have limited En glish proficiency (LEP), and 21% are living in poverty.

B4. Chinese Americans, socio- cultural barriers and lifestyle- related stomach cancer risk factors. 
Health care access. For Chinese American communities, the risk of stomach cancer is compounded by 
[CONTACT_792583], and attendant linguistic, cultural, economic and social barriers, which contribute to delayed cancer screenings,
21-24 poor medication adherence, and poor disease 
self-management skills.25-28 Acculturation ( which includes indicators such as nativity, years in the US, 
English language proficiency) is a significant factor that influences health access and behaviors for 
Chinese American immigrant communities, including impacting screening and disease prevention.25,[ADDRESS_1092662] -and- treat in high -risk Chinese populations.  
The American College of Gastroenterology’s 2017 clinical guidelines for treating H. pylori infection 
recommends clarithromycin triple therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin or metronidazole for 14 days where H. pylori clarithromycin resistance is known to be 
<15%.
[ADDRESS_1092663].

B6. Adherence to H. pylori treatment therapy. Adherence to medication, generally defined as >80% of 
medication uptake,30 is a crucial part of successful treatment and indispensable for reaching clinical 
goals.30,31 In the US, approximately 50%- 60% of patient s are non -adherent with their prescribed 
medicine, yet research into the causes of suboptimal adherence has been of variable quality and generally 
inconclusive.30,32-[ADDRESS_1092664] 
contribute to antibiotic resistance and H. pylori reinfection, undermining the effectiveness of the 
therapy.38,39 The benefit gained from H. pylori eradication such as reducing long- term risk of gastric 
cancer may not be obvious to the patient. Thus, patient education is critical for H. pylori therapy, 
especially given the multiple drugs and dosing intervals of the treatment regimen, along with the 
potential non -serious but uncomfortable side effects which can include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and 
nausea/vomiting.40,[ADDRESS_1092665] 
patients’ compliance are the com plexity of H. pylori treatment and the treatments’ side effects.37,42 One 
study in China identified the following specific factors for H. pylori medication nonadherence: lack of guidance on drug administration; lack of information about side effects; and preference for traditional Chinese medicine due to cultural beliefs that western therapi[INVESTIGATOR_792558].

an Irish hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792559], side effects, and compliance importance were significantly more likely to hav e H. pylori eradicated (94.7% compared 
with 73.7%; p-value=0.02).
[ADDRESS_1092667] targeted LEP or vulnerable populations for the 
prevention of stomach cancer. 
 
B7a. CHW approaches: a successful strategy for disease prevention in health disparity communities. The 
role of CHWs as important members of the healthcare workforce to improve health outcomes for vulnerable minority communities is recognized by [CONTACT_120845], Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, and the American Public Health Association.
47-49 (By [CONTACT_792584], CHWs have the potential to address health 
disparities and disseminate efficacious interventions to vulnerable communities. Linking Chines e 
American patients with CHWs in clinical settings will help patients understand and navigate the complex  
H. pylori eradication treatment to reduce stomach cancer risk.  
 
B7b. Electronic Health Record (EHR) interventions can improve cancer prevention and ca ncer outcomes. 
Physician recommendation and regular visits to the doctor significantly influence rates of screening within Asian American communities.

B7c. An integrated approach (EHR + CHW) is needed to improve education and adherence to stomach 
[ADDRESS_1092669] builds upon an evidence base of CHW effectiveness in low -income, LEP 
communities, and CSAAH’s experience in conducting CHW and EHR- based interventions for chronic 
disease prevention, past  observational and current pi[INVESTIGATOR_792560] H. pylori and stomach 
cancer prevention, and comprehensive hepatitis B- related liver cancer control work. This study proposes a 
unique integration of a health systems-based EHR and CHW-led intervention to address stomach cancer 
disparities among Chinese American communities. H. pylori eradication has demonstrated effectiveness 
in reducing the stomach cancer disparity in at-risk populations; however, insufficient numbers are being 
treated effectively in US. Hence, there is a critical need for theory -informed intervention research in real 
world settings to facilitate H. pylori eradication and reduction of stomach cancer disparities in at- risk 
Chinese American  immigrants.  
 
B9. Substudy Background. Gastric cancer is usually incurable when diagnosed at an advanced stage. 
About four out of five stomach cancers in the [LOCATION_002] are diagnosed after the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, with the five- year survival rate at [ADDRESS_1092670]-and- treat strategies for this stomach 
cancer disparity population. Guided by [CONTACT_39505]- AIM framework, we will systematically assess program 
adoption and sustainability to enhance reproducibility of findings and transferability to other Chinese 
American and vulnerable health -disparity populations. 
 
The intervention will be implemented at NYU Langone Health – which includes NYU Langone Brooklyn, NYU Langone Brooklyn Family Health Centers and affiliated provider practices, and NYU 
Ambulatory Care Centers – Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792561].

C2. EHR- CHW Intervention  
Planning Process. Applying a community- engaged approach, we will convene a transdisciplinary 
advisory group and meet on a monthly basis during Year 1 to engage in a collaborative planning process. 
Stakeholders will include representatives from the NYU Medical Center Information Technology 
(MCIT), physician champi[INVESTIGATOR_792562], project CHWs, representatives from Chinese- serving community organizations (e.g. the Chinese American Pl anning Council) and study 
investigators and staff. We will review existing quality improvement, Health Information Technology (HIT) initiatives, and other patient education resources that are currently integrated with the systems. We will host a series of MCIT supported WebEx online web conference learning exchanges within the first 4 months to share information about safety net hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792563] H. pylori eradication and stomach cancer prevention. Information from these learning 
exchanges will guide the advisory group’s efforts in planning the integrated EHR- CHW initiative.

with the existing pi[INVESTIGATOR_792564]. The Ecological Validity Model
78 complemented by a 
social marketing approach79 will be applied, to assess and adapt the materials. Small media materials will 
be produced by [CONTACT_792585] a par ticipatory process, adapted from our previous studies,80-82 
and may include bilingual palm cards and pamphlets on H. pylori eradication therapy, side effects and 
stomach cancer  prevention. 
 
To enhance scientific rigor, measure selection was based on: 1) brevity; 2) presence of domains with face 
validity for Asian American or low-literacy communities; and 3) valid psychometric properties. The 
primary outcome measure is the most rigorous outcome measure related to H. pylori eradication: 
confirmation of H. pylori eradication by [CONTACT_792586] H. pylori infection 
diagnostic test conducted 4 weeks –[ADDRESS_1092673]-treatment (to be extracted from EHR). Secondary 
outcomes include: self -efficacy, health literacy, medication adherence and other factors. Medication 
adherence measured using simplified medication adherence questionnaire (SMAQ) and medication adherence report scale (MARS -5). Self- efficacy will be measured by [CONTACT_792587] -Efficacy 
Scale. Health literacy will be ass essed using the short form of the European Health Literacy Survey 
Questionnaire (HLS- EU-Q12). Health- related quality of life will be measured by [CONTACT_33230]-Reported 
Outcome Measurement Information System Global Health Scale (PROMIS).
86 
 
During the interve ntion period, patients that meet the eligibility criteria will be identified. The bilingual 
CHWs will complete a brief screening form with potential participants in person or via phone (See Script 
for Telephone Screening  and Screening  form ). The screening  form  will assess demographic characteristics, 
participant eligibility, interest in our program, and reasons for refusal to participate. For in- person 
screenings, if the patient is eligible and interested in the study, the CHW will obtain verbal informed co nsent 
for study participation and describe the randomization process (See Combined Verbal Informed Consent ). 
For individuals identified  from  the EHR  registry  list, CHWs  will conduct phone screenings,  and will 
complete the verbal consent process by [CONTACT_792588], eligible individuals.  CHWs  will compi[INVESTIGATOR_792565] a weekly basis. All 
consented participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a computer -generated randomization87scheme 
to one of the study  arms.  
 
Consented participants randomized to the EHR- CHW intervention arm will receive a standardized 
protocol. The protocol, designed to be flexible, consists of 4 educational sessions to be delivered in a 
group, or per the participant’s preference one -on-one or via telephone or other social networking 
platforms (eg. WeChat). The sessions employ adult learning techniques and group- based learning 
activities. All session materials will be culturally and linguistically a dapted. The in -person sessions will 
be held at the clinics and community spaces identified by [CONTACT_792589]. Data will be collected by 
[CONTACT_792590], 2, and [ADDRESS_1092674] system files monthly that 
indicate date and time stamps and user logins for each time the tools were used and/or CHW embedded 
templates were accessed. Data will be extracted into a spreadsheet and analyzed by [CONTACT_5984].  
Qualitative ke y informant interviews  (See Key Informant Interview Guide) will be conducted by [CONTACT_792591] (1- 3 at each site), administrators (1 -2 at each site), and the CHWs (1 at 
each site). At baseline, the interviews will be incorporated into the workflow analysis to assess current 
satisfaction and EHR usage and health coaching. At follow -up, the interviews will assess barriers and 
facilitators to the implementation and adoption process of the integrated EHR -CHW intervention, 
intervention fidelity, and to solicit recommendations for the replication and scalability of the intervention to other clinical sites. Questions will be adapted from existing validated measures on acceptability, feasibility, adoption, organizational culture, and scalability.
88-93 
 
Qualitative ethnographic data wil l be collected through observations at the clinic sites. Ethnographic data 
will be collected by [CONTACT_792592] 1 and by [CONTACT_792593] 5 and will be guided by [CONTACT_941] 5 key steps in a rapid assessment process. Observations will occur in clinic waiting and administrative areas. Fidelity checklists will be conducted during CHW educational sessions and follow -up. 
 
C4. SUBSTUDY 
Substudy Design. The substudy is an observational feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. We aim to enroll a minimum of 10 participants. Only participants already enrolled in the main study are eligible for the substudy ( see 
Section II ). After enrollment into the main study, trained study staff will introduce study subjects to the 
substudy and offer subjects the opportunity to participate in th e substudy in several ways: 1) provision of 
oral wash sample only; 2) provision of stool sample only; and 3) provision of both oral wash and stool samples. Study staff will obtain verbal informed consent from interested individuals (See Combined Verbal Informed Consent ). Study staff who have obtained the verbal consent will document the consent 
and the date of consent on the Enrolled Participants Log. The Enrolled Participants Log is the only 
record linking a participant’s name, subject ID and substudy ID (if applicable).  Substudy participants 
will have the option of mail or in-person pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-up for receiving study materials, which include the kits to collect oral wash and fecal samples, participant instructions (See Substudy Instruction Booklet ), and 
return s tamped envelope. Once the substudy materials are received, study staff will set up an 
appointment to call or meet with substudy subjects remotely via WebEx and answer any questions about sample collection and returning the samples of the participant’s choice.  
 After the completion of their H. pylori antibiotic therapy (approximately two months after enrollment), 
subjects will be sent or given another biosample collection kit with instructions and a return stamped 
envelope for sample collection. For those w ho did not return study samples, study staff will give a 
reminder call by [CONTACT_17084]/or text message ( See Script for Substudy Telephone Text Reminders ). 
Subjects who return incomplete or unusable study samples will be sent or given another biosample 
collection kit with instructions and return stamped envelope.  
 
 
II. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESEARCH  POPULATION 
The overall number of subjects expected to parti cipate in the EHR- CHW Intervention study is 144. Key 
9 
 informant interviews will be conducted with approximately  10-12 individuals (project  CHWs,  providers, 
and administrators).  
 
EHR -CHW Intervention  
Inclusion Criteria :  An individual is eligible for the inte rvention if s/he: a) self identifies as Chinese 
American; b) is an outpatient aged 21+; c) plans to continue to live in the region during the next 12 
months; d) is willing to be randomized to either treatment or control groups; and e) has a confirmed diagn osis of H. pylori infection by [CONTACT_792594]: C- urea breath test, histology, 
rapid urease test or bacterial culture, fecal stool antigen test or other clinically approved H. pylori infection diagnostic test.
94 
 
Exclusion Criteria: T he exclusion criteria include: a) advanced chronic disease that would not allow the 
patient to complete follow -up or attend visits; b) allergy to any of the treatment drugs; c) previous gastric 
surgery; d) pregnancy or currently breastfeeding; e) taking antibiotics or bismuth salts within 2 weeks before the study. 
 
Rationale for proposed exclusion of gender and racial/ethnic group members: Individuals from other 
racial/ethnic groups are excluded from participation in the intervention as this study is focused on Chinese American adults. Men and women will both be invited to participate in this intervention. No children or vulnerable subjects will be enrolled in this study.  
 
Subs
tudy 
Inclusion criteria: An individual is eligible for the substudy if s/he is: a) enrolled in the EHR -CHW 
Intervention main study; and b) is willing to provide either an oral sample, a fecal sample, or both. 
Individuals will be excluded from the substudy if they are unable to mail the samples back to the study team.  
 
Key Informan t Interviews  
Inclusion Criteria: Interviewees must be an adult (18 years and over) and they must be a provider, an 
administrator, or a community health worker. Individuals will be excluded  from the interview if the 
interview cannot be conducted in the English language. 
 
III. METHODS & PROCEDURES  
A. Methods &  Procedures  
A1. EHR- CHW Intervention Components  
EHR Component 
Epic,  the EHR  system,  has been  integrated  at NYU Langone Health,  and is  being imp lemented  at 
Bellevue and Gouverneur Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. [CONTACT_771332] will oversee MCIT in creating the proposed EHR 
enhancements.  
 
The integrated EHR -CHW protocol will support team- based care by [CONTACT_792595], including: First,  templates will be created that CHWs can complete and upload into the 
EHR. Healthcare providers will be able to access these templates using EHR and building upon existing workflow. Second, health coaching and referral materials, to be developed by [CONTACT_792596], 
will be made available to providers through the EHR. Third , CHW communication with the healthcare 
10 
 team will be facilitated by [CONTACT_792597]- backs from CHWs during regular team “huddles” or 
staff meetings; the frequency of partic ipation will be site -specific and determined by [CONTACT_792598]. 
 
Integrated EHR- CHW Protocol Intervention.  
Orientation, Implementation and Training.  CHWs have been trained through the NYU -CUNY Prevention 
Research Center Training Program in a set of core competencies, which was developed by [CONTACT_792599] -Shevrin and Islam.95 
Enrollment & Randomization. H. pylori infected individuals will be identified and recruited into the study 
from NYC health care facilities (NYU Langone Health – which includes NYU Langone Brooklyn, NYU 
Langone Brooklyn Family Health Centers and affiliated provider practices, and NYU Ambulatory Care 
Centers – Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792561]). Participants will be identified by 2 approaches: 1) using ICD codes for H. pylori and Chinese ethnicity identified through a race and 
language code available in EHR, with recently diagnosed H. pylori infection (within 7 -days) will be 
identified; via a EHR registry list, and 2) patients will be recruited direc tly from the above mentioned 
clinics. All consented participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a computer- generated 
randomization scheme
87 to one of the study arms. 
 
CHW Intervention Components. The intervention arm protocol consists of 4 educational sessions: session 
1 will focus on medication adherence, treatment side effects, and the link between H. pylori and stomach 
cancer; and sessions 2 through 4 will focus on reinforcing session 1 themes, stomach cancer risk reduction, and links to community- based resources. The sessions employ adult learning techniques and 
group- based learning activities. All session materials are culturally and linguistically adapted. The in -
person sessions will be held at the clinics, community spaces identified by [CONTACT_792600]. These sessions will be accompanied by [CONTACT_25600], text or voicemail medication and follow-up reminders in the preferred language (frequency depending on participant preference ). The intervention 
materials will model scripts and messages informed by [CONTACT_792601], strategies and action plans for medication adherence 
and stomach cancer prevention. 
 
 
A2. Data Collection 
The recruitment and data collection protocol will be finalized with substantial feedback from the advisory 
group. All study staff involved in recruitment and data collection will receive a standardized training orientation on administerin g surveys and will be certified in human subjects research via the 
Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program). 
 
EHR data will be used for recruitment and for the determination of primary outcomes. [CONTACT_771332] will work with MCIT to identify potential participants from EPIC databases. During the recruitment period, registry lists will be generated weekly from EHR for physicians who have approved participation of their patients. Patients will be contact[CONTACT_792602] (up to 3 calls) or in person by [CONTACT_482233]. All preliminary 
EHR data will be deleted or shredded after one week of retrieval. EHR data to be shared with the study 
team include: demographics (gender, age, race/ethnicity (if available), language (if available), diagnosis of H. pylori through ICD codes, dates of clinic visits, name, and telephone number. Scheduled office visits will be tracked via quarterly EHR data pulls. EHR data will also be used to follow -up with the 
[ADDRESS_1092675] information will be collected from participants, including cell phone and home phone numbers, 
home and work address, email address, and Facebook/social networking account information. We will 
also assess whether participants are willing to receive text reminders on their cell phone. Additionally, a 
reminder letter and a small gift (tote bag, etc) will be sent to every participant who is willing to receive  
mail [ADDRESS_1092676] follow-up calls to schedule participants for data collection events in 
the community, at the clinic, or at their home, with permission. Participants will be compensated $25 for each assessments and will receive reminder calls and/or texts [ADDRESS_1092677] oral wash and/or fecal samples and return 
stamped envelope. Once the substudy materials are received, study staff will set up an appointment to 
call or meet with substudy subjects remotely via WebEx and answer any questions about sample 
collection and return.  
 
Substudy subjects will have the option to provide oral wash sample only, fecal sample only, or both. 
Study staff who have obtained the verbal consent will document t he consent on the Enrolled Participants 
Log. The Enrolled Participants Log is the only record linking a participant’s name, subject ID and 
substudy ID (if applicable).   Fecal biospample collection: S ubstudy participants will provide fecal samples (about 8  grams which is 
about 2 teaspoons) in a OMNIgeneGUT fecal sample tube ( DNAgenotek, Ontario, Canada).  
Directions for performing the test:  
1) Remove the fecal sample tube with preservation liquid inside from packaging.  
2) Flush the toilet, allow it to refill. Th e stool cannot touch the toilet bowl or water. Use one of the 
following collection options:  
a. Place saran wrap or provided stool collection paper over the toilet bowl to collect a sample of stool.  
b. Just before finishing a bowel movement, use a pi[INVESTIGATOR_792566] c ollect a small 
sample of stool. 
3) Use spoon attached to cap to collect 2 marble sized samples.  
4) Carefully screw the cap closed with sample on spoon. Shake well.  
5) Once the collection is complete, place the tube in the preaddressed package and seal carefully. Return to the study center by [CONTACT_792603].  
 Oral wash biosample collection:  Study participants will be asked to swish vigorously with one aliquot of 10 ml Scope Original mouthwash sample ( Proctor & Gamble, Cincinnati, OH) for [ADDRESS_1092678] 
techniques, including Student’s t- tests for normally distributed variables (after necessary transformations) 
and chi- squared tests for dichotomous variables. If the randomized groups differ in baseline 
characteristics, we will adjust for those variables in subsequent analyses of program effects. Descriptive 
statistics will be calculated to characterize study participants and to evaluate the distribution of key clinical, sociodemographic, and outcome variables. Summary data on medical history, years in the US, 
access to and utilization of primary health care services, and social characteristics (e.g., marital status, 
employment) will be reported. 
 
All analyses wi ll be conducted using intention -to-treat methods to minimize the risk of attrition bias. The 
primary analyses of differences in H. pylori eradication between the intervention and usual care groups 
will first be tested using a chi- squared test of binomial proportions. We will assess level of participation 
for those randomized into the intervention arm, and explore whether level of participation is associated with greater changes in health outcomes. Logistic regression analysis will be used to analyze differences in outcome between those who receive the intervention and those who do not, controlling for potential confounding factors. All quantitative data will be entered and analyzed using standard statistical packages 
(e.g., SAS, R, Stata).The primary analysi s will assume that any patient lost to follow -up failed to achieve 
H. pylori eradication. As a sensitivity analysis, we will apply multiple imputation to impute missing 
outcomes assuming a missing -at-random mechanism. 
 
The analysis of secondary outcomes is guided in part by [CONTACT_373998]. We hypothesize 
that the intervention group, when compared with usual care, will report: 1) increased medication 
adherence; 2) increased self -efficacy for adherence; 3) improved health literacy; 4) improved kn owledge 
about stomach cancer prevention; and 5) higher levels of perceived health related quality of life. We will compare these intermediate outcomes between groups using t- test or its non -parametric equivalent, the 
Wilcoxon rank- sum test. Sex as a biological variable will be addressed by [CONTACT_792604] a potential 
moderator of intervention effects.  
 
Power calculations. For the control group, we conservatively estimate that approximately 55% will achieve H. pylori eradication based on several studies of overall and, specifically, Chinese American 
populations.
36,45,46,[ADDRESS_1092679] an increase in this rate to approximately 80% in the intervention 
group; this difference is reasonable based on studies in Ireland and China that showed increases of approximately this magnitude in rates of knowledge and high adherence in similar populations.
36,44,45 
Accrual of 144 participants, evenly randomized to intervention or usual care, provide greater than 80% power to detect this difference, using a 2-sided, 0.05- level test.  
 
B1a. Substudy Data Analysis.   
Oral and gut microbiome data will be derived from the 16S rRNA sequencing assay from the oral wash 
and fecal samples. Based on barcoded 16S rRNA gene sequence read, each sample will be described  as 
13 
 having “relative abundance of taxa (from bacterial phyla, genera, and species)”.  The pre -processed 
sequences will be further analyzed using QIIME pi[INVESTIGATOR_792567].  In 
short, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_792568]/upstrea m statistical analyses: (a) sequence sorting by 
[CONTACT_792605]; (b) pairwise alignment and clustering of sequences into operational 
taxonomic units (OTUs); (c) computation of absolute abundance matrix; (d) computation of alpha 
(species richness, Shannon index, Simpson index) and beta diversity (e.g. weighted and unweighted Unifrac) with rarefaction; and (e) principal component analysis (PCA) generation.  All representative sequences from OTUs will be classified at taxonomic levels from phyl um to genus using the high 
throughput Classifier at RDP II.  Community structure will be described using membership and 
distribution of every member for a given sample.  Because the number of reads generated from samples 
will vary, we will compare the relative distribution instead of the absolute frequency of organisms between samples.  The relative abundance for a given taxon will be calculated as the number of reads from this taxon divided by [CONTACT_792606]. 
 
Anonymized demographic information will be extracted from the main study database and shared with 
authorized study staff on a weekly basis. Descriptive statistics will be calculated to characterize substudy 
participants and to evaluate the distribution of key clinical, sociode mographic, and outcome variables. 
Summary data on medical history, years in the US, access to and utilization of primary health care services, and social characteristics (e.g., marital status, employment) will be reported.  
 
B2: Assessment of Implementatio n, Adoption, Sustainability, and Scalability Analysis. 
B2a. Evaluation Framework . Guided by [INVESTIGATOR_21392]- AIM,1,[ADDRESS_1092680] data on the delivery of the 
intervention and its potential for sustainability and scalability with the goal of facilitating  its 
impleme ntation into routine practice. The process evaluation will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and 
sustainability of the intervention. 
 
B2b. Data Sources and Collection. We will use mixed methods to document challenges, barriers, and 
facilitators associated with implementing the multifaceted intervention; these will help to characterize 
feasibility and acceptability in clinic settings, to assess fidelity to the evidence -based strategy, and to 
determine model sustainability and scalability. Data sou rces will include: 1) quantitative data on 
utilization patterns captured from the EHR; 2) qualitative in -depth interview data (key informant 
interviews) from providers, clinic staff, and CHWs; and 3) ethnographic observational data of workflow at clinic si tes, use of EHR tools, and organizational barriers and facilitators. 
 
B2c. Analysis. Analysis to address this aim will be guided by [CONTACT_540522]: 
1. U tilization Patterns: How frequently do providers utilize the integrated EHR- CHW system and does 
the utilization pattern change over time? Does the intervention increase the utilization and quality of 
measurement reports? The system utilization files from MCIT will be used to analyze utilization patterns 
of the enhanced decision-support or physician ale rt function, as well as the integrated EHR -CHW  options. 
These data will yield descriptive trends for frequency of utilization across the clinic sites as well as an estimate of the percentage of adoption in terms of patient follow -up visits. The frequency of quality 
measurement reports will be described and compared [ADDRESS_1092681]-intervention. 
2. Providers and Clinic Staffs’ Attitudes Regarding the Integrated Intervention:  
 What are providers’ 
attitudes regarding H. pylori eradication guidelines? How satisfied or dissatisfied are the providers and 
staff with the integrated EHR- CHW tools? What are the barriers and facilitators of point -of-care use of 
14 
 the tools? How does the intervention affect providers and staffs’ satisfaction with workflow for stomach 
cancer prevention and H. pylori eradication? This set of research questions and the following set will be 
primarily addressed with data from in-depth i nterviews. Qualitative analysis is described below.  
3. B arriers and Facilitators to Implementation Adoption and Implications for Scalability: What 
organizational barriers and facilitators appear to influence implementation of the integrated EHR- CHW 
interventi on and its component strategies and how? Did members of the clinics understand and respect 
the respective roles of providers, CHWs, and other members of the team? How were users involved in design  and implementation?  Interview  data will be transcribed  and observational data will be collected  in 
the form of field notes. 
 
Analysis of qualitative data from transcriptions and field notes will follow the "constant comparison" analytic approach.
102 The “constant comparison” approach is a method of explanation bui lding in which 
the findings of an initial case are compared with a provisional category, property or proposition, revised as necessary and then other details or new cases are then compared against the revision and revised again 
as needed. This iterative pr ocess is continued until theoretical saturation is reached.
102 Central to this 
process is the "thematic" coding scheme. We will develop an initial set of codes, which will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_792607]. For each core code, we will 
ultimately develop one or more "secondary codes" that represent either more specific or restricted aspects of the phenomenon, to contextualize it, or to suggest underlying meanings. The secondary codes will vary 
in specificity or subtlety depending on the judged substantive value of additional refinements. Transcripts 
will be coded by [CONTACT_2669] 4 coders. Coding discrepancies will be discussed and resolved, then the process will be repeated with a new set of transcripts until an accep table level of inter -coder reliability has been 
achieved, estimated using an appropriate chance-corrected statistic (e.g., kappa for nominal data and T- 
index for ordinal data).
[ADDRESS_1092682] -protected computers behind the NYULMC fi rewall. Data will ultimately be disseminated 
through oral presentations, reports and manuscripts and will only contain anonymized data (no PHI). 
The following steps will be taken to keep subject’s private information secured: any paper files will be 
stored  in locked file cabinets; only NYULMC IT approved and encrypted storage devices will be used to 
transport/store patient data. Databases will be secured with password protection. The data will be stored 
indefinitely. Patients’ personal information will be k ept confidential to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_792608]. To safeguard 
confidentiality and anonymity, a unique code will be assigned to participants. Only the study staf f will 
have access to the information that links participants with their unique code. Names of survey 
participants will not be reported in any publication. All computer systems are protected from possible 
[ADDRESS_1092683] access to subjects’ private information.  
Efforts will be made to minimize invasion of privacy by [CONTACT_792609].  
 
Patient Surveys  
To safeguard confidentiality and anonymity, unique identifiers will be assigned to all participants for all portions of the study and all data collection instruments will identify participants only by [CONTACT_792610]. On the baseline and follow -up surveys, the first page of the survey will ask participants for 
updated contact [CONTACT_792611]. After the data is collected, the firs t page of the survey will be removed from the remainder of the survey 
instrument (which will only contain unique identifiers). Data will be entered into REDCap, a survey database platform, by a study staff member. Only study staff will have password protected access to the 
data. Laura Wyatt, MPH will serve as the data manager for this study. The Data Manager will be 
responsible for the management of information obtained at the various clinic sites.  
The database will be stored on REDCap’s secure database system, which will be utilized for data management purposes. Survey pages containing participant names and contact [CONTACT_792612]’ identifying information to study numbers will be kept locked in a file cabinet in a secure 
location. Paper baseline and follow- up survey data will be kept separate from identifiable information and 
kept in locked file cabinets in a secure location. Contact [CONTACT_792613] (both electronic and hard copy) upon the dissemination of trial results (approximately 5 years).  
 Substudy Biosample Handling and Security . The samples in containers will be received by [CONTACT_792614] -80 ˚C  at a laboratory facility with space dedicated to our 
study samples. Within two weeks of receipt, DNA will be isolated from these specimens and used to 
conduct microbiome assays.  Vials will only be labeled with unique study numbers and be clearly marked as substudy samples. No samples will be collected in a vial labeled with patient identifiers. If a sample 
does arrive with patient identifiers, those identifiers will be removed and discarded by [CONTACT_792615] a uniq ue study number. Samples will be stored for the duration of the 
study and destroyed upon the dissemination of trial results (approximately 5 years).  Substudy Data Handling and Security . All samples are traced with a computer database that records 
sample t ype, storage location, date of collection and storage, and study identification number. A separate 
Enrolled Participants’ Log will be maintained which links the specimen  to the patient through the study 
identification number. This log will also link the pa tient to the main study. This log will only be 
accessible to authorized study staff. Neither patient identifiers nor the key will be available to staff 
managing samples at the specimen bank. Data and specimens will be stored without linkage codes to 
ensure the permanent anonymity of the study subjects. Anonymized demographic information will be 
extracted from the main study database and shared with authorized substudy staff on a weekly basis. Main study and substudy data will be maintained on separate passw ord-protected databases and server 
locations, and made accessible only to study staff. 
 
Key Informant Interviews. Unique study IDs will be assigned to each key informant in REDCap, and these unique study IDs will track interview logistics (including interview date/time, location), interview audio file names, and interview transcripts. The REDCap data, audio- recordings and interview transcripts 
[ADDRESS_1092684] id is [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. 
 
IV. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
Risks and protection against  risks  
The proposed study and substudy poses minimal risk to participants.  Loss of confidentiality is the 
greatest potential risk to study subjects. There is very minimal risk in providing oral and/or fecal 
biosamples. Participants may feel uncomfortable collecting the samples. Participants can choose not to 
collect the sample(s) if they are uncomfortable. Locked file cabinets will be used to store materials with identifying information. All computer systems are protected from possible external access. All data and interviews will be stored on a password -protected computer at the NYUGSOM. Names will be replaced 
with identification num bers. All audio recorded key informant interviews will be stored on a password-
protected secure computer at the NYUGSOM. Once audio recordings are transcribed and entered onto a password protected database, the recordings will be deleted from the study fil es. Key informant 
participants will have the right to refuse to participate without any compromise of their employment status, reputation or professional relationships. Records of participations will not be linked to employment 
records. Also, if a participant is uncomfortable during an interview situation, they may stop the interview 
at any time without penalty. The data collected for this study will be used strictly for the purposes stated in this application and will only be available to NYU research  staff. 
 
Potential Benefits to the Subjects  
CHW Intervention: By [CONTACT_792616], participants may gain the benefit of augmented services related to their H. pylori treatment and stomach cancer -related risk factors. Some 
patients may individually experience no benefit. This study will yield knowledge regarding methods for increasing adherence to evidence- based guidelines for treating H. pylori among providers and heal th staff 
serving Chinese American populations. Overall, the benefits of understanding effective methods for 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_792569] H. pylori far 
outweigh the remote possibility of a breach of co nfidentiality.  
 Substudy: While participants may individually experience no benefit, the substudy will yield further  
knowledge of the oral and gut health of Chinese Americans with H. pylori  and the impact of antibiotic 
therapy on their microbiome.

[ADDRESS_1092686]  IDENTIFICATION, RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT/ASSENT  
A. Method of Subject Identification and  Recruitment  
EHR -CHW Intervention: H. pylori infected individuals will be identified and recruited into the study from 
the following NYC health care facilities: NYU Langone Health – which includes NYU Langone Brooklyn, NYU Langone Brooklyn Family Health Centers and affiliated provider practices, and NYU Ambulatory Care Centers – Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792561]. Participants will be identified by 2 approaches: 1) using ICD codes for H. pylori and Chinese ethnicity identified through a 
race and language code available in EHR, patients w ith recently diagnosed H. pylori infection (within 7- 
days) will be identified; via a EHR registry list, and 2) patients will be recruited directly at the above 
mentioned sites, all of which serve a substantial Chinese American population. In endoscopy clinics, patients are routinely evaluated for H. pylori infection. 
 
CHWs will complete a brief screening form with potential participants in person or via phone, depending on the preference of the potential participant and the safety of the study staff and potential participants. The form will assess demographic characteristics, participant eligibility, COVID -[ADDRESS_1092687] in our 
program, and reasons for refusal  to participate.  For in-person screenings,  if the patient  is eligible  and 
interested  in the study, the CHW will obtain verbal informed consent for study participation and describe 
the randomization process (See Combined Verbal Informed Consent ). All study staff will follow COVID -
[ADDRESS_1092688] will receive phone calls by [CONTACT_29441] (See Combined Script for 
Telephone Screening), during which CHWs will explain the study and elements of  informed consent, and 
will complete the process for verbal informed consent over the phone with interested,  eligible  individuals.  
Participant  names and  phone numbers will be needed in order for the CHWs  to contact [CONTACT_792617] (Please see Application for Waiver of Authorization and Documentation of 
Consent ). In addition, a screening form (See Telephone Screening Form for CHW Intervention ) will be 
completed to verify eligibility. CHWs will call patients a maximum of [ADDRESS_1092689] linking a participant ’s name, subject ID and substudy ID (if applicable).  
 No undue pressure will be given to subjects to participate in both studies as participation is entirely voluntary (See Combined Verbal Informed Consent). 
 
 
Key Informant Interviews. Participating providers, administrative staff and community health workers 
of clinic sites will receive an invitation to participate in the interview (See Invitation and Elements of 
Informed Consent for Key Informant Interview ). No undue pressure will be given to subjec ts for 
participation as the participation is entirely voluntary (See Verbal Consent Script for Key Informant 
Interview ). 
 
B. Process of  Consent  
All study personnel will have completed the NYU IRB Mandatory Tutorial and IRB Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Training before commencing any data collection activities. 
The informed consent form for this study have been created by [CONTACT_792618], including HIPAA.  
EHR -CHW Intervention . To maintain consistency in consent procedures and to reduce selection bias, 
verbal informed consent obtained for both in- person and telephone enrollment (see Application for 
Waiver of Authorization and Documentation of Consent ).  
 
If screening is conducted in person, consent processes will take place at clinic sites in a manner that maximizes confidentiality and privacy and allows questions to be asked. All study staff will follow COVID -[ADDRESS_1092690] safety and personal protective equipment policies at each recruiting clinic site and 
as required by [CONTACT_792619]. Participants will be screened in advance for symptoms and asked in advance to wear a mask/face covering. All study staff and participants will follow efforts for social distanci ng 
whenever possible. Eligible participants demonstrating interest in participating in the project will meet with a study team member who will explain the intervention and answer any questions. Verbal consent 
(see Combined Verbal Informed Consent)  will be obtained in a location allowing privacy and appropriate 
social distancing, on a one-on-one basis.  
 Participants are free to withdraw from participating in the study at any time without repercussions. Participants will be advised during the consent process that they have the right to withdraw entirely and 
that their refusal will not jeopardize their relationships with their CHW or primary care physician.  
 Substudy . Only participants already enrolled in the main study are eligible for the substudy. Study sta ff 
will obtain verbal consent from interested participants ( see Combined Verbal Informed Consent ) and 
offer subjects the opportunity to participate in the substudy in several ways: 1) provision of oral wash sample only; 2) provision of stool sample only; and 3) provision of both oral wash and stool samples. Participants will be advised participation in the substudy is optional and that their refusal to participate in the substudy will not jeopardize their participation in the EHR -CHW Intervention. Participa nts are 
free to withdraw from the substudy at any time without repercussions. 
 
Key Informant Interviews. A Waiver of Documentation of Consent is being requested for participants of 
Key Informant Interviews for this study (See Application for Waiver of Documentation of Consent for 
21 
 Key Informant Interview ). This request is being made because the consent form, if collected would 
require names to be collected and in doing so would be the only record linking the subject’s name [CONTACT_792627]. Verbal consent wil l be obtained to audio- record prior to the start of the interview, but we will 
not collect any personal information or identifiers. Individual names will not be recorded or appear in 
interview notes. Participants will be free to withdraw from the interview  at any time without 
repercussions. Participants will be provided with an invitation including the elements of the written 
consent as well as contact [CONTACT_645787]. Verbal consent will be obtained from the key informants prior to beginning t he interview in -person or over the phone as preferred by [CONTACT_3445] (See 
Verbal Consent Script for Key Informant Interview ). 
 
C. Capacity 
We anticipate that all subjects will have the capacity to give informed consent. Language barriers will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_792620] (to be translated upon approval of the English version). 
 
D. Subject/Representative Comprehension  
To determine that the subject or his/her authorized representative understood the information presented, they will be given the opportunity to ask questions before giving consent to participate. They can also 
choose at that time not to be in the study. The individuals authorized to obtain consent will do so by [CONTACT_792621]. The individuals will explain the purpose of the study, the procedures, possible risks and anticipated benefits, that it is voluntary, and how to withdraw if they choose to at a l ater time. Chinese speaking personnel will obtain consent from limited 
English -speaking individuals using a translated Verbal Informed Consent script. Subjects will also be 
asked if they are willing to receive key information about the study by [CONTACT_469696] e. If they are, the Key 
Information Sheet will be texted to them using an NYU- issued, password -protected telephone. 
 
E. Debriefing  Procedures  
Information will not be withheld from the subjects related to their participation in the study. 
 
F. Consent  Scripts  
Please refer to the consent scripts: Combined Verbal Informed Consent Script  and the Key Information 
Sheets  for CHW Intervention  and the substudy;  and Invitation and Elements of Consent and Verbal 
Consent Script documents for the Key Informant Interview. 
 
G. Documentation of Consent  
EHR -CHW Intervention and Substudy . Study staff will obtain consent by [CONTACT_792622]’s legally authorized representative, and the subject or 
representative will be given adequate opportunity to ask questions before verbally consenting. The 
subject will receive a copy of the key information sheet by [CONTACT_792623]. A translated verbal informed consent and key information sheet will be used for non-English spe aking subjects, 
depending on their preferred language. 
 
Study staff who have obtained the verbal consent will document the consent and the date of consent on 
the Enrolled Participants Log. The Enrolled Participants Log is the only record linking a participant’s name, subject ID and substudy ID (if applicable).  
22 
  
Signed informed consent forms from participants consented in earlier versions of the protocol will be 
stored in a separate folder in a locked cabinet accessible only to study staff.  
 
Key Informant Interviews. A Waiver of Documentation of Consent is being requested for participants of 
the Key Informant Interview for this study (see Application for Waiver of Documentation of Consent for 
Key Informant Interview ). This request is being made because the consent form, if collected, would 
require names to be col lected and in doing so would be the only record linking the subjects name [CONTACT_792627]. Verbal consent will be obtained prior to the start of the interview, but we will not collect any personal information or identifiers. Names of individuals will not be recorded nor appear in interview notes. Participants will be free to withdraw from the interview at any time without repercussions.  
Participants will be provided with an invitation including the elements of written consent as well as contact [CONTACT_645787]. Verbal consent will be obtained from the key informants prior to 
beginning the interview (See Verbal Consent Script for Key Informant Interview ). 
 
H. Costs to the  Subject  
There are no costs to participate in this study. Any doctor visits and laboratory tests, including the fecal antigen test or other clinically approved H. pylori infection diagnostic test, are part of standard care.  
 
I. Payment for Participation  
Participants will receive a payment of $25 each time they complete a questionnaire ( baseline, 2 months 
and 6 months). Participants may receive metro cards for travel associated with the project.

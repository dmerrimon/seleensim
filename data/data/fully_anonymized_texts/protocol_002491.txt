1. Introduction  
As of September 7, 2017, the dose escalation study as proposed in this protocol continues to accrue 
subjects at 8 mg/kg/day of anakinra as was approved by [CONTACT_179381] 10, 2017. Thus far, 
anakinra has  been well-tolerated and safe without any serious adverse events ( SAEs ) related to 
study drug. Throughout this protocol, this study is named “Phase I/IIa anakinra study”.  
 
Our recent work has demonstrated that the inflammasome-dependent i nterleukin (IL) -[ADDRESS_210995] is 
upregulated with increased transcript abundance and levels of proteins including IL-1 β and IL-1 
receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) in infants and children with acute KD.(Hoang 2014) In addition, our 
preliminary studies indicate that KD sera induce expression of TIFA (TNF-receptor -associ ated factor 
[TRAF]-interacting protein with a forkhead-associated [FHA] domain) in endothelial cells ( ECs) 
(Figure 1). Notably, TIFA, an upstream activator of NF-κ B through IL-1R signaling, has emerged as 
a key mediator in innate immunity and a likely participant in the activation of the NLRP3 (nucleotide-
binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome 
leading to IL -1β production.(Ea 2004, Huang 2012, Lin 2016)  
 
However, additional recent work  by [CONTACT_179382]-[ADDRESS_210996] that is  important to prevent 
coronary artery abnormalities (CAA) in KD. The 
transformation of endothelial cells to a 
myofibroblast phenotype through endothelial -
mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) in the coronary artery wall also contributes to 
aneurysm formation.  (Shimizu 2013) Statins, 
commonly prescribed as cholesterol -lowering 
agents, have pleotropic effects on vascular ECs that include improving E C function, decreasing 
oxidative stress, and modulating innate and acquired immune responses . (Liao 2005, Oesterl e 2017) 
Using an in vitro model with human ECs, we demonstrated that the krüppel -like factor 4
 (KLF4)-
microRNA -483 (miR -483) axis is suppressed and markers of EndoMT, including connective tissue 
growth factor  (CTGF ), are induced following incubation with sera from acute KD patients  (Figure 1). 
This effect is reversed when ECs are cultured with sera from atorvastatin-treated KD patients.( He 
2017) Given the pleotropic effects of statins, we conducted a Phase I/IIa, dose-escalation trial of 
atorvastatin for acute KD patients with early CAA  (IND # [ADDRESS_210997]. Jane C. Burns (co-I of 
this proposal); N CT01431105). (Tremoulet 2015) Subject accrual was recently completed for this 
study and atorvastatin was demonstrated to be safe and well -tolerated. In this study of children at 
least 2 years old, the maximum dose in the study (0.75/mg/day up to 80 mg/day) was found to be the maximum tolerated dose.  
 
These in vitro data, in combination with the safety of anakinra and atorvastati n in Phase I/IIa, dose-
escalation studies, serve as the motivation to propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_179341] 8 
mg/kg/day and atorvastatin at 0.75 mg/kg/day in children with acute KD at least 2 years old who are suffering from CAA . Throughout this protocol, this study is  referred to as the “Combination therapy 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]”.

8. Backg round  & Significance  
8A. Significance  
Kawasaki Disease (KD), the 
most common cause of 
acquired heart disease in 
children in Western 
developed countries and 
Asia, is a systemic vasculitis 
of unknown etiology. In the [LOCATION_002], there are at 
least 5-6,000 new cases 
each year (Kaneko 2011). 
However, without a specific 
diagnostic test, the true 
burden of disease is 
unknown. At Rady Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59303], we cared for over 85 new KD 
patients in 2013 and follow 
over 1,200 families in our 
outpatient KD Clinic (350 
outpatient visits/year), of 
whom 9% developed 
aneury sms and 25% 
developed dilated coronary 
arteries. In Japan, the 
country of highest incidence 
(>215/100,000 children < 5 
yrs.), there are more than 
12,000 new cases each year and rates continue to rise 
(Nakamura 2010). KD 
causes both a myocarditis 
and a vasculitis that 
damages the coronary 
arteries and other medium -
sized muscular arteries 
(Yutani 1980, Yonesaka 
1989). The major sequelae 
of aneurysms include 
thrombosis, late coronary 
artery stenosis, myocardial ischemia, myocardial 
infarction, and death (Kato Figure 2. IL1signaling pathway was the key upregulated pathway in 
acute KD  
 
A) Transcripts involved in IL1 signaling pathways were more 
abundant in acute KD ; differenti ally abundant transcripts between 
acute and convalescent KD samples are highlighted in red. B) and 
C) IL1R1 and IL1receptor associated protein ( RAP) were 
differentially expressed only in acute vs. convalescent KD but not in 
other diseases. ** P value < 0.0 1

 1996, Gordon 2009). Clearly, aneurysm prevention is a primary goal of treatment during the 
acute phase of the disease, which leads us to f ocus on treatment of patients with early signs 
of coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs) in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in combination with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_179352]. 
The major acute risk of aneurysm formation is th rombosis, which can be prevented with systemic 
anti-coagulation with warfarin or enoxaparin in addition to antiplatelet therapy with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_179353] (>6 mm). However, there is no recommended therapy 
to halt the progr ession of arterial wall destruction and prevent aneurysm formation beyond 
the initial dose of IVIG.  
 
 
8A1. Role of IL- [ADDRESS_211004] proteins in the plasma (Maury 1988, Leung 1989, 
Popper 2007, Hoang 2014). (Figure 2 and Table 1)

controls) and shared among KD, viral and bacterial infection groups. Pathways are ordered by [CONTACT_179386] (p-value). Individual probe P values are uncorrected. Yellow highlighting identifies transcripts that were 
significant in more than one pathway. Red box identifies transcripts in the IL -[ADDRESS_211005], anakinra, prevented the development of coronary 
lesions, as did knocking out the IL-1 receptor (Lee 2012). Anakinra has been used to treat a severe 
KD patient who was non-responsive to IVIG treatment (Cohen 2012).Treatment with anakinra was 
safe and coincided with a decrease in systemic and cor onary artery inflammation. The proposed 
study will determine if anakinra is safe to use in young children with KD and has 
demonstrable anti-inflammatory activity at a well-tolerated dose. Assessments of drug activity 
will allow us to determine appropriate end-points for a future Phase III study to address the 
efficacy of anakinra in attenuating vascular wall damage and preventing aneurysms in KD patients.

 8B. Use and s afety of anakinra in infants and children  
Anakinra is currently used in several inflammatory diseases in infants and children, including 
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and the autoinflammatory syndromes known as cryopyrin-
associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) (Hoffman 2009, Ringold 2013). In a recent study of 26 
patients with the autoinflammatory syndrome neonatal -onset multisystem inflammatory disease 
(NOMID), treatment with anakinra for [ADDRESS_211006] commonly reported complication (Sibley 2012). A similar study using anakinra 
in another CAPS, Muckle Wells syndrome, did not demonstrate any SAEs  in the 12 patients treated 
with anakinra, of whom 5 were children (Kuemmerle-Desc hner 2011). Two case reports have been 
published reporting the use of anakinra in children with refractory, acute KD. A 2 year old with giant 
aneurysms who failed therapy with IVIG and steroids and developed giant aneurysms was treated 
with a 6 week cour se of anakinra at 1 mg/kg (Cohen 2012). He suffered no adverse effects and at 6 
months coronary angiography demonstrated resolution of the aneurysms, which was unexpected in 
such a severe case of KD. An 11 week old with KD and giant aneurysms was refractory to three 
doses of IVIG, steroids and a dose of infliximab (Shafferman 2014). She was treated with anakinra 
initially at 6 mg/kg/day and then increased to 9 mg/kg/day. She too did not suffer any adverse effects 
and at an [ADDRESS_211007] common 
adverse reaction is irritation at the injection site. Table 2 is a summary of published and unpublished 
data on the use of anakinra in children <2 years old:

8C. Safety of atorvastatin in children  
The safety of atorvastatin in children as young as 2 years of age with acute KD was assessed in a 
Phase I/IIa dose escal ation study (IND [ADDRESS_211010]. Jane C. Burns, co-investigator of this 
study). On May 19, 2016, the DSMB for this  Phase I/IIa study evaluated the data from the Phase I 
dose-escalation study of atorvastatin for [ADDRESS_211011] 2 years with acute KD and 
coronary artery damage. The DSMB determined that a 6 week course of atorvastatin was safe and 
well-tolerated in children ≥ 2 years with acute KD. In addition, based on the review of the safety of the 
Phase I study, the DSMB determined 0.75 m g/kg/day of atorvastatin to be the maximum tolerated 
dose. An additional 10 subjects were enrolled at 0.75 mg/kg/day as part of the dose expansion cohort study and further demonstrated the safety and tolerability of this dose in acute KD.  The level of the cholesterol brain metabolite, 24-OH cholesterol, was measured in both statin-treated KD patients and 
in those treated with standard therapy for KD. No significant difference was found between the 
groups in the levels of 24-OH cholesterol, further demonstr ating the safety of atorvastatin in acute KD 
as it does not reduce the levels of 24-OH cholesterol , which are important for normal brain 
development.   
 
On August 1, 2017, this original Phase I/IIa dose -escalation and expansion cohort study was 
completed. On August 4, 2017, an annual report of the atorvastatin IND was sent to the FDA 
demonstrating that there had been no unexpected, adverse events in this study and that atorvastatin was safe and well -tolerated. An abstract reporting the results of the Phase I study has been accepted 
for poster presentation at the American Heart Association in November 2017.  
8D. Importance of the problem  
Once aneurysms have formed, there is no way to turn back the biologic clock and undo them. The 
transmural inflammation destr oys the normal architecture and even in children who remodel the 
aneurysm to form a more normal lumen, the vessel is never functionally normal again. The remodeled segment cannot dilate normally during increased myocardial oxygen demand and thus 
serves as a functional stenosis. It has been estimated that there are currently over 24,000 young 
adults in the [LOCATION_002] with a history of KD, including over 8,000 with a history of coronary artery 
abnormalities. Without a new therapeutic approach this number i s expected to grow by 1,400 
individuals each year (Gordon 2009) . A recent study found that over 5% of all young adults (<40 
years) evaluated by [CONTACT_179387] (Daniels 2012).  
8E. Ongoing KD European clinical trial of anakinra  
Sobi Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of Kineret® (anakinra), is currently supporting a clinical trial 
in Europe, treating IVIG -resistant KD patients (≥ 8 months of age) with a 14-day  course of anakinra. 
In this trial, there will be within-subject dose escalation starting at 2 mg/kg and increasing every 24h 
through 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg based on persistence of fever .

The current clinical practice is to give every patient the same standard therapy (IVIG 2g/kg with 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 30-50/kg) and to monitor for CAA. In the unfortunate child who carries the genetic risk for CAA, no  intervention to modify vessel wall inflammation is currently recommended (Newburger 
2004).  
 In a recent article entitled “Mining for therapeutic gold”, Director of the NIH, [CONTACT_179405], stated 
that “repurposing” therapeutics should be a strategy “to translate research into clinically useful 
products” (Collins 2011). Our goal is to translate our findings on the role of the IL-[ADDRESS_211013] in acute 
KD and “repurpose” anakinra to test the hypothesis that the anti -inflammatory properties of this drug 
will prevent or attenuate coronary artery aneurysms in infants and children with KD.    
 
8F2. Potential of Combination therapy pi[INVESTIGATOR_179354]-[ADDRESS_211014] and EndoMT in acute KD and 
“repurpose” anakinra and atorvastatin in combination to test the hypothesis that the anti -inflammatory 
properties of these drugs in combination will prevent or attenuate coronary artery aneurysms in children with KD.  
8G. Paradigm shift if Specific Aims are achieved  
By [CONTACT_105620], we will bring to the forefront the need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_179355]. The paradigm shift will be to intensify initial therapy  for KD patients, thus acknowledging the urgency of early intervention to 
prevent the permanent disability associated with aneurysm formation. Furthermore, given the unique 
immunological expertise within our group, demonstration of the immunomodulatory effects in a 
cardiovascular disease could pose a novel treatment for other cardiovascular diseases.

2-D transthoracic echocardiograms (2-D Echo) will be performed on all KD subjects according to a 
strict pre-determined protocol  at standard of care time poi nts. All echocardiographic images will be 
analyzed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Beth Printz, Director of Non-Invasive Cardiovascular Imaging at Rady Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59303]. She will be blinded to patient data and clinical status. [CONTACT_179406] will also assure 
adherence to the echo protocols across all echocardiogram technicians. 2-D Echo will be performed 
at KD diagnosis (within 24h of IVIG infusion) and again at two and six weeks following enrollment with sedation when clinically indicated. The internal lumen diameters of the left main (LMCA), 
proximal and distal LAD, circumflex, posterior descending, and proximal and distal RCA will each be 
measured.  Dimensions of the LMCA, proximal LAD, and proximal RCA will be adjusted for body 
surface area and expressed in standard dev iation units (Z-scores) (Manlhiot 2009). A variable “Z 
worst any vessel” will be created to capture the maximal Z score of the RCA or LAD at any time point, as well as the Z-score of the LMCA if an aneurysm is present there with a Z-score l arger than 
that of the RCA or LAD. Coronary artery aneurysm will be defined as a Z- score of 2.5 or larger of the 
RCA or LAD (Nishiike 2006).  
 
17 
 Additional echocardiographic data will be collected to assess aortic root dimensions and left 
ventricular dimensions and function, including indices of diastolic ventricular function (mitral inflow Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging), as recent reports have demonstrated abnormalities in each of 
these parameters following acute KD (Kato , Printz ) Aorti c root and ventricular dimensions and 
function will be expressed as body surface area (BSA) - or age-adjusted Z scores. A dilated aortic 
sinus diameter will be defined as a BSA-adjusted Z score ≥ 2.0 (Ravekes 2001). LV systolic 
dysfunction will be defined as an age-adjusted LV fractional shortening Z score < -2; LV diastolic dysfunction will be defined as an abnormal age-adjusted mitral inflow Doppler E’ -wave, E’/A’ ratio, or 
mitral deceleration time according to published normative data (Chaudhuri ).

12. Dosing Protocol  
12A. Dose Levels  
12A1. Dosing for  Phase I/IIa anakinra study 
All subjects will be treated with IVIG (2g/kg) and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (30- 50 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours; 
lowered to 3-5 mg/kg/day once sent home) , which is the standard of care . In order to minimize the 
pain from subcutaneous injections, the first two dose s of anakinra have been administered 
intravenously  and divided every 12 hours  for the dose escalation part of the study (i.e. 4 mg/kg/day is  
2 mg/kg every 12 hours for two doses). As has been published in the peer -reviewed literature, we 
administered the dose by [CONTACT_179390] a 1 to 3 minute period ( Opal 1997). As anakinra is formulated 
for intravenous  administration, dilution is not necessary prior to administration.  T he unused material 
is discarded in a medical waste container after each administration. See Appendix A  for details 
regarding preparation of the study drug for administration of less than [ADDRESS_211026] dose of the 
medication. This study has 3 dose levels (4 mg/kg/day, 6 mg/kg/day, and 8 mg/kg/day), with a 
maximum dosage of 200 mg daily  (Table 5).   
 
If the daily dose of anakinra for a subject is ≤ 100mg, then the subject will receive a subcutaneous 
injection of anakinra once daily. If the daily dose of anakinra is greater than 100 mg (with a max dose of 200 mg daily), then the dose will be split in half with administration subcutaneously every 12 hours (i.e. a total daily dose of 150 mg will be administered as 75 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours).

 Table 5 . Dose Levels  
Dose Cohort  Dose Level  Number of Subjects

2 6 mg/kg/day  3-6 
3 8 mg/kg/day  3-6 
TOTAL  9-18 
 
Due to anakinra's predominant renal clearance, its dose is reduced in adults with significant renal 
dysfunction, 30mL/min (30% of normal adults).  Given immaturity in renal function of infants, no 
infants will be enrolled during the first 4 weeks of life.   At the age of 4 weeks, the typi[INVESTIGATOR_179361] a 
term infant is approximately 1.5 mL/min/kg (Rhodin et al. Pediatr Nephrol. 2009 Jan;24(1):67-76.).  This represents 40-45% of the mature adult value (allometrically scaled), or approximately 50% above the threshold for dose reduction due to renal dysfunction in adults  (45 mL/min/1.73m
2).  We 
will require that individual study participant infants have renal function significantly better than eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73m
2.  At 4 weeks of age, the original infant Schwartz equation predicts a eGFR of 35 
mL/min/1.73m2 with a serum creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL.  To provide an additional safety buffer and 
account for more specific creatinine assay in use today, we will only enroll infants with screening Scr 
≤ 0.50 mg/dL, approximately equivalent to an eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73m2. For children ≥ [ADDRESS_211027] 45 mL/min/1.73m2. Calculations will be made with the widely accepted 
modified Schwartz equation ( http://www.globalrph.com/specialpop.htm ). As we do not expect renal 
abnormalities to occur with KD or because of anakinra, Scr will only be assessed at baseline.  
 
12A2. Dosing for Combination therapy pi[INVESTIGATOR_179362] (2g/kg) and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (30- 50 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours; 
lowered to 3-5 mg/kg/day once sent home), which is the standard of care.  
Anakinra will be administered once or twice daily subcutaneously at 8 mg/kg/day  with a maximum 
dose of 200 mg/day. If the daily dose of anakinra for a subject is ≤ 100mg, then the subject will 
receive a subcutaneous injection of anakinra once daily. If the daily dose of anakinra is greater than 100 mg (with a max dose of 200 mg daily), then the dose will be split in half with administration 
subcutaneously every 12 hours (i.e. a total daily dose of 150 mg will be administered as 75 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours).  
 Atorvastatin will be administered orally once daily at 0.75 mg/kg/day with a maximum dose of 80 
mg/day. 
 
12B. Duration of Study Drug 
12B1. Duration of study drug for Phase I/IIa anakinra study  
All subjects will receive 2 weeks of therapy. Subjects with an echo at 2 weeks that shows  either a 
LAD or RCA  z-score ≥ 2. 0 will receive an additional 4 weeks of therapy to complete a total course of 
6 weeks. All subjects will remain on study for the full 6 weeks whether or not they are receiving 
anakinra.  
 
12B2. Duration of study drug for C ombination therapy pi[INVESTIGATOR_179363] 2 weeks of therapy. Subjects with an echo at 2 weeks that shows either a LAD or RCA  z-score ≥ 2. 0 will receive an additional 4 weeks of therapy to complete a total course of 
6 weeks. All subjects will remain on study for the full 6 weeks whether or not they are receiving anakinra and atorvastatin. 
12C . Dose Limiting Toxicity /Adverse Drug Toxicity  
12C1. Dose limiting toxicity for Phase I/IIa anakinra study  
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) will be defined as any of the following at the 2 or 6 week time point: 
19 
 • Serious infection qualifying as an SAE (see Section 12) and requiring intervention  
• A decrease in the white blood cell count (WBC) to <1500/mm3 (Grade 3 severity by 
[CONTACT_4289]/NIAID) (NIH 2009) 
• An anaphylactoid reaction to an injection of anakinra 
 
A low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is considered part of the natural course of KD and usually 
occurs 2 weeks after the initial illness (Tremoulet 2011). Given this, a low ANC will not be considered 
a DLT or an adverse event in this study.  
 
12C2. Adverse Drug Toxicity  for Combination therapy pi[INVESTIGATOR_179364] 2 or 6 week time point:  
• Serious infection qualifying as an SAE (see Section 13) and requiring intervention  
• A decrease in the white blood cell count (WBC) to <1500/mm3 (Grade 3 severity by 
[CONTACT_4289]/NIAID) (NIH 2009) 
• An anaphylactoid reaction to an injection of anakinra 
• ALT or AST more than 3x the upper limit of age and sex -adjusted normal AND >50% increase 
over baseline (pre-IVIG)  
• CK elevation > 10 times the upper limit of normal or symptoms of muscle pain due to myositis  
• A decrease in total cholesterol (TC) level that is at least 10% lower than entry level AND below 100 mg/dl (~2.5th percentile for children age 2 yrs.)  
 A low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is considered part of the natural course of KD and usuall y 
occurs 2 weeks after the initial illness (Tremoulet 2011). Given this, a low ANC will not be considered an adverse drug toxicity  or an adverse event in this  study.  
12D. Dose Escalation  for the Phase I/IIa anakinra study  
The first 3 subjects in the study will be treated with 4 mg/kg/day  as an IV dose of 2 mg/kg q 12 h and 
then as 4 mg/kg/day SQ  for 2-[ADDRESS_211028] (DSMB) for evaluation as to opening the next dose level ( 6 mg/kg) 
(Tables 5 and 6). Additional subjects will be enrolled at the highest dose if a dose limiting toxicity is 
not reached at 8 mg/kg/day for further study in the Phase IIa (total number of subjects is 30).  
 
Table 6 . Dose Escalation Decision Rules  
Subjects with a 
DLT at a Given Dose   Escalation Decision Rule  
 
0 out of 3  Enter 3 patients at the next dose level  until maximum tolerated dose . 
1 out of 3  Enter a total of 6  patients at this dose level.  
• If 0 of these additional  patients experience a DLT, proceed to the 
next dose level.  
• If 1 of these addi tional  patients experiences a DLT, then dose 
escalation is stopped  (see below)  
≥ [ADDRESS_211029] dose 
level if only 3 patients were treated previously at that dose. This lower 
dose level will be declared  the MTD.  
 
Probability of Dose Escalation: The following probabilities of dose escalation ( Table 7) are computed 
as the sum of the binomial probabilities of the following two possible outcomes that would allow dose escalation to occur: (1) no DLT observed in the first three subjects; or (2) one DLT observed in the 
first three subjects, followed by [CONTACT_179391]. For example, when the underlying DLT rate is no more than 15%, the probability of dose escal ation 
will be at least 81% or alternatively 19% probability of early study termination. Exact 95% binomial 
confidence intervals will be used to describe the rate of successful dose escalation.

True but unknown DLT rate  ≤0.1 ≤0.15  ≤0.2 ≤0.3 ≤0.4 
Probability of escalation  ≥91%  ≥81%  ≥71%  ≥49%  ≥31%  
 
12E . Maximum Tolerated Dose  for Phase I/IIa anakinra study  
The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)  will be defined as the highest dose of anakinra studied at which 
no more than one in six patients experiences a DLT during the [ADDRESS_211030] been enrolled in the study. 
Given the 3+3 design of the study, if there is a DLT then a total of 6 subjects will enrolled per dose 
level. If we reach the 8 mg/kg/day dose level, then up to a maximum of 12 subjects will be enrolled at 
a dose level below the MTD ( 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg). This leaves [ADDRESS_211031] two levels, then 3 subjects will be 
enrolled in these two drug levels (total of 6 subjects) leaving [ADDRESS_211032] dose level is reached.  
12F . Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
 
 
12F1. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_179365] I/IIa anakinra study  
Individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]:  A subject who experiences a DLT will discontinue anakinra immediately  
and will be monitored for resolution of the toxicity as medically appropriate. All subjects will be 
monitored for the 6 weeks from the time of enrollment or until resolution of the DLT, whichever is 
later.   Study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]:  Table [ADDRESS_211033] dose ( 4 mg/kg/day), the number of subjects that experiences a DLT is 
greater than 2.  Otherwise, the study will determine its MTD using the escalation rules described.    
12F2. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_179366]:  A subject who experiences any of the following adverse drug toxicities will discontinue anakinra immediately: 
• Serious infection qualifying as an SAE (see Section 13) and requiring intervention  
• A decrease in the white blood cell count (WBC) to <1500/mm
3 (Grade 3 severity by 
[CONTACT_4289]/NIAID) (NIH 2009) 
• An anaphylactoid reaction to an injection of anakinra  
A subject who experiences any of the following adverse drug toxicities will discontinue atorvastatin immediately: 
• ALT or AST more than 3x the upper limit of age and sex -adjusted normal AND >50% increase 
over baseline (pre-IVIG)  
• CK elevation > 10 times the upper limit of normal or symptoms of muscle pain due to myositis  
• A decrease in total cholesterol (TC) level that is at least 10% lower than entry level AND below 100 mg/dl (~2.5th percentile for children age 2 yrs.)  
 Any subject who experiences an adverse drug toxicity that warrants discontinuation of a study drug will be monitored for resolution of the toxicity as medically appropriate. All subjects will be monitored 
for 6 weeks from the time of enrollment or until resolution of the adverse drug toxicity, whichever is 
later.  
 
21 
 Study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]:  The study will be discontinued if three subjects experience adverse drug 
toxicities .   
13. Monitoring Sid e Effects  
13A. Monitoring side effects for Phase I/IIa anakinra study  
Subjects will be monitored for 6 weeks to evaluate for adverse events  (AEs). The main side effect of 
anakinra is an infusion site reaction. The most serious adverse event would be an infection or 
hypersensitivity reaction. All subjects will be monitored for both AEs and SAEs . An AE is any 
unfavorable or unintended change in a sign (i.e. abnormal laboratory), symptom or disease 
temporally associated with the study treatment, whether or not it is considered to be related to the study product.

14. Ad ditional Therapy  for Phase I/IIa anakinra study and 
Combination therapy pil ot study  
14a. Management of Treatment-resistant Subjects  
Treatment-resistance will be defined as persistent or recrudescent fever (T≥38.0˚C rectally) ≥36 
hours and <7 d ays following end of IVIG infus ion. Subjects who meet criteria for treatment-resistance 
will be treated at the Center PI’s discretion.  
14b. Additional Therapy for Coronary Artery Abnormalities  
Additional therapy for coronary artery abnormalities will be at the Center PI’s discretion. A Phase III, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of the addition of infliximab to primary treatment with IVIG demonstrated that early treatment of infants and children with acute KD  with infliximab plus IVIG  had 
a more rapid decrease in inflammation, fewer days of fever, and a more rapid decrease in the internal 
23 
 diameter of a dilated coronary artery compared to IVIG therapy alone (Tremoulet 2014). Thus, 
subjects in this study will be eligible to receive infliximab at the discretion of the Center PI.  
15. Sampl e Size  
15A. Sample size for Phase I/IIa anakinra study  
A study population of a minimum of 18 KD patients treated with the MTD of anakinra (See Section 
11E for subjects at MTD)  and [ADDRESS_211037] 80% power based on a two-sided, paired t-test to compare change scores from baseline 
between cases and controls with alpha set to 0.[ADDRESS_211038] a minimum difference for the change 
score for several transcript levels of the IL-1 family, including IL-1RAP  (pooled S D of 3.2 and 
corresponding difference of 2.2) and IL-1R1 (pooled SD of 8 and corresponding difference of 5.6). 
The effect sizes are based on relevant changes that were found in the largest KD microarray study 
done to date  (Hoang 2014).  
 
15B. Sample size for Combination therapy pi[INVESTIGATOR_179369] a difference in echocardiographic measurements or treatment 
response compared to controls. Instead, the sample size w ill be  determined based on detectable 
differences in inflammatory markers and readouts from in vitro EC studies. A sample size of 10 KD 
patients treated with anakinra/ atorvastatin combination therapy  vs [ADDRESS_211039] 80% power based on a two-sided, paired t-test with 
alpha set to 0.[ADDRESS_211040] size of 89% in the mean change of EC homeostasis (i.e. markers 
of EndoMT) and inflammasome activation (i.e. TIFA, NLRP3) using the in vitro  EC culture system.  
16. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  for Phase I/IIa anakinra study  
The area un der the concentration-time curve ( AUC ) around the first dose for anakinra will be roughly 
estimated as the initial concentration (the concentration extrapolated back to time zero) divided by 
[CONTACT_179395], if the elimination appears first-order (log  scale) or zero -order (linear scale). We 
will also roughly estimate the AUC using the trapezoidal rule up to the last measurable concentration. 
The extrapolated area after the last concentration will be estimated as C last/λz, where C last is the last 
measurable concentration and λz is the terminal slope of the curve. AUC from time 0 to infinity AUC 0–
∞ is calculated as AUC 0–last + C last/λz. Noncompartmental oral clearance rate (Cl/F NC) is calculated as 
the ratio of dose to AUC 0–∞. Apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F NC) is calculated as Cl/F NC over λz. 
Half-life (t 1/2) is calculated as 0.693/λz. Plasma anakinra trough concentrations collected in the 
subacute phase (weeks 2 and 6) will be compared to the [ADDRESS_211041]-dose concentration collected 
during the acute phase (study day 2 ). AUC 0–∞, Cl/F 1-C (oral clearance from 1-compartment model), 
and Vd/F 1-C (volume of distribution from 1-compartment model) will also be determined using a 1 -
compartment model. This second modeling approach will be used because the data are relatively sparse for an intensive PK study, which may limit our ability to estimate every parameter for some patients.  
17. Immune Monitoring  for Phase I/IIa anakinra study  
PBMC will be separated by [CONTACT_179396] (pre -treatment, [ADDRESS_211042]-treatment) for staining with specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to 
characterize DC lineages, macrophages and their activation/maturation stage. Anti -DR (MHC class II 
molecules) and anti -CD86 define maturity and activation. CD11c defines the DC lineage, and is not 
expressed on macrophages. Antibodies anti -CD11c will be used in combination with anti -DR and 
anti-CD86 and other markers, well described in the literature. Briefly: to define myeloid DC: anti -
CD11b, (also expressed on macrophages but negative in plasmacytoid DC and thymic DC) and anti -
BDCA -1. To define immature tolerogenic myeloid DC very relevant in the immune-regulation in KD, 
we will look at CD14, co-expressed on macrophages but not on plasmacytoid DC, in CD11c+ CD11b+ 
myeloid DC. Macro phages will be identified by [CONTACT_20376]11b and CD14 in CD11c negative 
cells. To enumerate activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and regulatory T cells (Treg) we will use anti -
[ADDRESS_211043], anti -CD25 (Treg are CD25high) and anti -IL-7 receptor, expressed on pro-
inflammatory cells and peripherally -induced Treg but not in natural Treg. 
18. Measures of Activity   
18A. Measures of inflammation for Phase I/IIa anakinra study   
Transcript abundance will be measured in whole blood by [CONTACT_20483] . Levels  of hsCRP, α-1 -
antitrypsin and fibrinogen, and the WBC and ESR will be measured in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_179370] . 
Levels of TNFaR1 and R2, IFNg, IL-1 RAP, IL-1R1 and R2, MMP9, c aspase-1, IL-6 R, IL-18RAP, IL-
12, sIL-2R, TGFb and IL-10 will be measured by [CONTACT_6428]. Results of transcript abundance and 
measures of inflammation will be compared to database controls from the KD Research Center (>600 
KD patients with available RNA and plasma samples in our biorepository) matched (1 case: 2 
controls) by [CONTACT_654] (± 2 yrs. with lower limit of 2 yrs.), sex, and coronary artery Z-score.  
 
18B. Measures of inflammation and endothelial cell function for Combination therapy 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_179371]-1R accessory protein and soluble IL- 1R1 from the study 
subjects and controls as surrogates for IL-1α and IL-1β, which are not stable in patient plasma. To 
further assess inflammation, we will also measure the following pro-inflammatory cytokines in 
plasma: IL-17, IL-6, sIL- 6R, TNFαR1, IFNγ, as well as the anti -inflammatory cytokine IL-10. To 
assess the change in MMP9 activity that could be a direct effect of atorvastatin treatment,(Koh 2002, 
Massaro 2010) we will measure plasma MMP9 levels. Transcript levels in whole blood RNA  
(PAXgene ® tubes) of all of the above analytes  will be measured using a c ombination of TaqMan 5' -
nuclease Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) and the Inflammatory cytokine array 
(Qiagen) . Relative abundance of the target transcripts will be normalized to the expression level of 
TAF1B, which has been validated as a housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_179372].(Popper 2007) Time points for all of the above studies will be baseline, [ADDRESS_211044]-
treatment. Three different control groups  with samples collected at similar time points will be matched 
from our KD biorepository at UCSD (>600 subjects) : standard treatment alone (n=20) , standard 
treatment+atorvastatin (n=10) , and standard treatment+anakinra (n=10). Banked samples, including 
those from Phase I trials of both anakinra and atorvastatin, will allow us to match study patients on 
potentially important variables including age, sex, illness day at diagnosis, and baseline coronary 
artery damage as measured by [CONTACT_179397] . 
 
Subject and control sera will be compared for suppression of the innate immune response by [CONTACT_179385]. IL-[ADDRESS_211045]-treatment paired sera. These readouts of innate immune activation and EC functi on will be 
correlated with clinical data.  
19. Statistical Analyses  
19A. Statistical analysis of safety  for Phase I/IIa anakinra study and 
Combination therapy pi[INVESTIGATOR_179373] s, variables 
related to biologic activity, immunologic variables, PK variables, and safety data. The study population will be described using summary descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard 
deviation, and range for continuous variables and fr equencies for categorical variables. All events 
(AEs, SAEs, and UPRs) will be recorded, documenting the course, outcome, severity, and 
[ADDRESS_211046] one dose of study treatment. Deviation from the treatment 
plan will be recorded in the case report forms. The percentage of subjects failing to complete the 
study or discontinuing prematurely (as well as the times and reasons for discontinuation) will be 
reported.  Refer to Section 12 E for the operating characteristics of the Phase I dose escalation for the 
Phase I/IIa anakinra study . 
19B. Statistical analysis of inflammatory studies  
19B1. Statistical analysis of inflammation studies for Phase I/IIa anakinra study  
The objective of this matched case -control study is to determine the activity profile of anakinra in the 
treatment of KD subjects with CAA. Measures of inflammation will be compared to that of matched 
controls via paired statistical tests (e.g. McNemar’s test for categorical outcomes or the paired t-test  
for continuous outcomes). Non -parametric alternatives will be considered only if dist ributional 
assumptions are violated. 
 
Control Group:  Controls  will be chosen from the >600 subjects with data in our web-based data 
repository in REDCap. Controls will be matched to study patients based on age, sex, Illness Day at diagnosis, and baseline Z score . 
 Analysis: Each marker will be initially summarized descriptively and analyzed individually. Separate 
multivariable mixed effects regression modeling for clustered data (to account for the case-control 
paired nature of samples) will be used to char acterize the markers of anakinra-treated subjects 
versus matched controls to adjust for any known confounders and additional time points (baseline, 48 hours, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks). In addition, any covariate at the individual level that is simultaneously unbalanced and associated with the outcome will be included in the model. Covariates of interest 
include demographic variables (e.g., ethnicity, Illness Day at diagnosis, response to IVIG therapy). 
Permutation tests may be implemented to verify that valid p-values will be obtained even if model 
assumptions are not correct. Note that the mixed model seamlessly accommodates different times of measurement (e.g. 2-week and 6-week time points)  as well as missed measurements and data from 
subjects who are lost to follow -up. A corresponding Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model 
will be used as the sensitivity analysis method.  An analogous secondary model including all subjects 
in this study will also be considered to examine the dose versus activity relationship. In this model, 
dosage will be included as a covariate to examine any dosage trend in activity.  
 The above approach will be repeated for the other markers . That is, multi- level mixed effects 
regression models analogous to the above methodology will be applied for other markers: Levels of high sensitivity  (hs) CRP, alpha-[ADDRESS_211047] and then microarray analysis procedures will be used to measure abundance.  The R software (version 3.0.2) and Bioconductor package in R will be used for the analysis. For coronary outcomes as assessed by [CONTACT_51541], we will compare the delta Z scores (baseline minus 2-
weeks and 6-weeks) between anakinra subjects and matched controls. A GEE model will be used as 
the sensitivity analysis method. Since this is a safety  and early efficacy study, no adjustments for 
multiple comparisons will be made for biomarker analyses . P-values less than 0.05 will be considered 
statistically significant.  All statistical analyses will be performed in R version 3.2.0 (
www. r-
project.org/).   Similarly, analyses will be repeated on all subjects to characterize any dose-activity 
relationship, adjusting for dosage as a covariate in the model. 
 To determine the “best” or “set of best” markers that have the greatest improvement from baseline in 
anakinra-treated patients, ROC and AUROC analysis will be considered.  In the event that there is 
[ADDRESS_211048] the markers, we will adopt the “glmpath” approach, which is based on 
Least Angle Regression (LARS) methods to select the best biomarkers (Park 2007).  
 
Missing data assumptions: The proposed mixed-effects regression model is consistent under the 
assumption that the outcome data are “missing at random” (MAR), that is, mixed models with a random effect assume only that the probability that an outcome is missing depends on observed outcomes. GEE models, which are proposed as a sensitivity analysis, assume that the outcome data are “missing completely at random”, that is, that the probability that an outcome is missing does not 
depend on any previous, present or succeeding value of the outcome. This will enable us to assess 
the impact of the missing data mechanism on statistical inferences drawn from these models.   
 
19B2. Statistical analysis of inflammation and endothelial cell studies for Combination 
therapy pi[INVESTIGATOR_179374]- control study is to determine the activity profile of the combination 
of anakinra and atorvastatin in the treatment of KD subjects with CAA. Measures of inflammation and 
endothelial cell function will be compared to that of matched controls via paired statistical tests (e.g. 
McNemar’s test for categorical outcomes or the paired t-test for continuous outcomes). Non -
parametric alternatives will be considered only if distributional assumptions are violated. 
 Control Group:  Controls  will be chosen from the >600 subjects with data in our web-based data 
repository in REDCap. Controls will be matched to study patients based on age, sex, illness d ay at 
diagnosis, and baseline Z score. 
 
Analysis: Each marker will be initially summarized descriptively and analyzed individually. Separate 
multivariable mixed effects regression modeling for clustered data (to account for the case- control 
paired nature of samples) will be used to characterize the markers of treated subjects versus 
matched controls to adjust for any known confounders and additional time points (baseline, 48 hours, 
2 weeks, and 6 weeks ). In addition, any covariate at the individual  level that is simultaneously 
unbalanced and associated with the outcome will be included in the model. Covariates of interest 
include demographic variables (e.g., ethnicity, Illness Day at diagnosis, response to IVIG therapy). Permutation tests may be implemented to verify that valid p-values will be obtained even if model assumptions are not correct. Note that the mixed model seamlessly accommodates different times of measurement (e.g. 48h and 2-week time points)  as well as missed measurements and data fr om 
subjects who are lost to follow-up. A corresponding Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model will be used as the sensitivity analysis method. To determine the “best” or “set of best” markers that 
have the greatest improvement from baseline in anakinra/atorvastatin-treated patients, ROC and AUROC analysis will be considered to choose the best of set markers for a future clinical trial. In the event that there is high multicollinearity amongst the markers, we will adopt the “glmpath” approach, which is  based on Least Angle Regression (LARS) methods to select the best biomarkers.(Park 
2007)  
 
Measures of transcript abundance will also be analyzed via RNAseq . The R software (version 3.0.2) 
and Bioconductor package in R will be used for the analysis. For coronary outcomes as assessed by [CONTACT_51541], we will compare the delta Z scores (baseline minus 2- weeks and 6-weeks) 
between anakinra subjects and matched controls. A GEE model will be used as the sensitivity 
analysis method. Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], no adjustments for multiple comparisons will be made for 
biomarker analyses . P-valu es less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  All statistical 
analyses will be performed in R version 3.2.0 (www. r-project.org/
).

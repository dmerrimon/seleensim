2. INTRODUCTION  
PellePharm, Inc. is developi[INVESTIGATOR_692158] (BCNS), a rare genetic disease characterized by [CONTACT_692170] a lifetime. This trial will evaluate the 
ability of patidegib gel to shrink BCC tumors in patients with sporadic BCCs as a proof -of-
concept for the mechanism of patidegib on BCCs.  It is hoped that results from this study will 
inform the do se and dosing regimen prior for future trials, thereby [CONTACT_692171].  
Patidegib is a semi -synthetic small molecule, and the topi[INVESTIGATOR_692159], safe excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Oral patidegib has a good ther apeutic efficacy versus locally 
advanced and metastatic BCCs but produces the same types of adverse effects as do other 
systemic HH inhibitors. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_692160] -pig sk in without irritation.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_692161]1 biomarker 
expression in vitro in human BCC tumor explants.  
If proven to be safe and effective in future clinical trials patidegib gel may offer BCNS patients a 
safe and effective therapy to manage their burden of disease by [CONTACT_692172], Inc.  Page 8 
Protocol Number: [ADDRESS_938944] in  nodular BCC tumors in patients with sporadic BCCs.  
The goal of the present trial is to evaluate topi[INVESTIGATOR_692162]’s safety, tolerability, and effects on 
the size of preexist ing sporadic previously untreated nodular BCCs and thereby [INVESTIGATOR_448901] a 
dose and dosing regimen for future trials in the BCNS orphan population. It is anticipated that 
subsequent trials will focus on reducing the number of facial surgeries required by [CONTACT_692173] “treatment” of individual sporadic BCCs. If the efficacy with topi[INVESTIGATOR_692163], it would represent a major advance for BCNS patients.  
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the following:  
1. The safety and tolerability of treatment with patidegib gel 2% or 4% or vehicle applied 
once or twice daily for 12 weeks.  
2. The molecu lar efficacy of treatment as defined by [CONTACT_692174] (HH) 
signaling pathway after treatment with patidegib gel 2% or 4% or vehicle applied twice 
daily for 12 weeks to treatment -targeted BCCs.  
The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate  the following:  
1. The clinical efficacy of patidegib as defined by [CONTACT_692175] [ADDRESS_938945] diameter 
on the face (excluding the nose and periorbital skin) and n o less than [ADDRESS_938946] diameter at sites other than the face.  
Exploratory objectives:  
1. To evaluate the utility of an investigator static global tumor assessment (ISGTA) in 
assessing the proportion of baseline treatment -targeted  BCCs that are evaluated as being 
clear or almost clear.  
2. To evaluate the utility of blinded assessment of change in BCC size using photographs .

 4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall Study Design  
This is a double -blind, dose escalating, randomized, vehicle -controlled study designed to assess 
the efficacy and safety of patidegib gel 2% and 4% in comparison with vehicle applied once or 
twice daily. The population of subjects will be enrolled from the . 
Approximately [ADDRESS_938947] 6 subjects randomized to active drug and 3 randomized 
to vehicle. The four sequential cohorts will be : 
• Cohort 1: patidegib gel 2% or vehicle applied once daily,   
• Cohort 2: patidegib gel 4% or vehicle applied once daily,  
• Cohort 3: patidegib gel 2% or vehicle applied twice daily, and  
• Cohort 4: patidegib gel 4% or vehicle applied twice daily.  
As soon as one cohort has been enrolled the next cohort will be recruit ed. The study drug will be 
applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_692164] -targeted nodular BCCs once or twice daily for 12 weeks of 
treatment.  
Upon completion of the 12 -week treatment period, all subjects will be asked to return to the 
investigational center for final  evaluation. At the Week 12 visit the treatment site(s) will be 
excised. The area excised should at a minimum include the original diameter of the tumor. This 
means that if the tumor has shrunk in size the entire original area of the BCC will be excised, n ot 
just the visually apparent residual tumor.  During the study, subjects will be allowed to use 
moisturizers and emollients and sunscreen. The Investigator will assess the areas affected at each 
visit.  
The treatment -targeted BCC(s) will be identified by [CONTACT_692176], Weeks 6 and 12, and photographed, and measured at all study visits 
(Baseline, Weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12).  
Biomarkers:  On ea ch subject one or two baseline previously untreated nodular BCCs designated 
as a treatment -targeted tumor will be biopsied and at the end of 12 weeks of treatment the 
treatment site(s) will be excised. Both samples will be evaluated histologically and for 
determination of GLI1 mRNA levels.  
Blood samples for complete blood count and serum chemistry and urine for urinalysis will be 
collected from subjects at Screening, Week 6, and Week 12.  
[COMPANY_003]
 
   
Statistical Analysis Plan  for PellePharm, Inc.  Page 10 
Protocol Number: 926 -202 28Sep2017  
 
 Subjects who terminate study participation early will be asked to co mplete all Week 12 
assessments, as appropriate, prior to commencement of any alternative therapy for BCC (if 
possible). Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be 
replaced.  
If signs or symptoms develop in the treatment areas during the treatment period that restrict daily 
activities or make continued application of the study drug difficult due to discomfort, the 
Investigator may instruct the subject to interrupt use of the study drug temporarily and to resume 
application  of the study drug once the signs/symptoms have subsided. The Investigator should 
try to minimize study drug interruptions; and if needed, make best efforts to limit a “drug 
holiday” to no more than [ADDRESS_938948] who has an 
AE during the treatment period will be monitored by [CONTACT_692177] (return to 
normal or to the baseline state) or stabilization, as determined by [CONTACT_737].  
In addition, application of study drug may be delayed or halted at any time if ongoing safety data 
evaluations raise concern for subject safety. If the subj ect participation is suspended, all of the 
subject’s safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_692178].  
4.1.[ADDRESS_938949] ion 5.1 of the protocol.  
4.1.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
This is a double -blinded study, in which the identity of the study drug will be unknown to 
Investigator and subjects, as well as to all individuals closely associated with the study.  
Subjects will be enrolled into 1 of the 4 sequential study drug groups of 9 subjects with 6 being 
randomized to active and 3 to vehicle within each group. The sequential groups will be patidegib 
or vehicle gel 2% applied once daily, patidegib or vehicle g el 4% applied once daily, patidegib or 
vehicle gel 2% applied twice daily, patidegib or vehicle gel 4% applied twice daily. Each 
screened subject will be assigned a unique [ADDRESS_938950] of the 2 digit investigational center number and the 3 
digit chronological screening order number, starting with 001 (e.g., [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE]). The study 
 
   
Statistical Analysis Plan  for PellePharm, Inc.  Page 11 
Protocol Number: [ADDRESS_938951] numbered kit 
available in inventory at the investigational site. A study drug accountability log will document 
the inventory and dispensing of study drug at the investigational c enter.  
4.1.3 Blinding  
The study drugs will be packaged and labeled identically, and the study drug kits will be 
numbered sequentially and dispensed randomly to the subjects on the study. Study drug supplies 
will be distributed to the investigational center to ma intain the randomization ratio.  
As a double -blinded study, the Investigators, the site staff, PellePharm, and the Clinical 
Monitor(s) will not be aware of the treatment assigned to the individual study subjects. 
Delegated staff members at the investigation al center will dispense the study drugs and will 
collect and weigh all used and unused study drug tubes as scheduled.  
The treatment assignments for all enrolled subjects will be completely unblinded only after the 
conclusion of the treatment phase of the s tudy. However, a fter Cohort s [ADDRESS_938952] complete 
biopsy results, and again after Cohort 3 ha s complete biopsy results, the sponsor and the CRO 
will be unblinded in order to assess limited safety and efficacy results.  
5. EFFICACY  AND SAFETY  ENDPOINTS  
5.1 Efficacy Endpoints  
The efficacy endpoints are intended to compare once and twice daily application of 2% patidegib 
gel, 4% patidegib gel, and vehicle gel. Efficacy assessments will be summarized descriptively by 
[CONTACT_6982].  P-values will be provided for descriptive purposes only.  
5.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is change in GLI1 mRNA levels in drug -treated versus vehicle -
treated tumors at Week 12 . 
5.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
The secondary efficacy endpoint  is the decre ase in tumor size defined in two ways:  
1. Percent of baseline treatment targeted BCCs with Complete or Partial Response at Week 
12 as assessed by [CONTACT_692179]1 where Complete Response is determined 
when  there is no longer any visible evidence of a lesion consistent with BCC at the site , 
Partial Response is determined when although a BCC still remains at this site, it has 
demonstrated a visible decrease in size compared with baseline, and No Response is 
 
   
Statistical Analysis Plan  for PellePharm, Inc.  Page 12 
Protocol Number: 926 -202 28Sep2017  
 
 determined when  the BCC has not demonstrat ed any visible decrease in size compared 
with baseline, and;  
2. Percent decrease in the greatest diameter of baseline treatment targeted BCCs at Week 
12. 
5.1.[ADDRESS_938953] clear  in the  investigator static global tumor assessment 
(ISGTA) assessment . 
The second exploratory endpoint is the proportion of baseline treated tumors that are smaller 
based on blinded photographic review . Tumor area will also be assessed  at each study visit . 
From tumor area, a ‘Yes/No’ for whether the tumor is smaller will be derived such that if area at 
visit is less than area at baseline this is ‘Yes’.  
5.2 Safety Endpoints  
Safety will be assessed thro ugh adverse events, dermal safety and tolerability, safety laboratory 
values and vital signs measurements, and pregnancy tests . 
6. STATISTICAL AND ANALY TICAL PLANS  
6.1 General Methodology  
All statistical processing will be performed using Statistical Analysis Sys tem (SAS®) unless 
otherwise stated. No interim analyses are planned. If determined appropriate by [CONTACT_1034], 
limited safety and efficacy interim analysis on tumor shrinkage and biomarkers may be 
performed.  
Formal  inferential testing will not be performed , however p -values will be provided for 
descriptive purposes . Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy 
and safety results. P-values which are supplied are for descriptive purposes only. For categorical 
parameters, the numb er and percentage of subjects in each category will be presented. For 
continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will include n (number of subjects), mean, standard 
deviation  (SD) , median, minimum  (min) , and maximum  (max) .  For by [CONTACT_692180] a single group.  
The last observation carried forward method (LOCF) will be used to impute missing secondary 
and exploratory efficacy data (i.e., the last available on -therapy observation for a subject will be 
used to estimate subsequent missing data points). Analyses will also be carried out on an ‘as 
 
   
Statistical Analysis Plan  for PellePharm, Inc.  Page 13 
Protocol Number: 926 -202 28Sep2017  
 
 observed’ basis without imputation. No imputations will be made for missing primary endpoint 
data or safety data.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_938954] using SAS® Version 9.3 or later.  All summary tables 
and data listings will be prepared utilizing SAS® software.  
The standard operating procedures (SOPs) of QST will be followed in the creation and quality 
control of all d ata displays and analyses.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_938955] dose of study drug.   
6.1.3 Visit Windowing  
Data will be summarized based on nominal visit indications with the exception of data captured 
at ear ly termination and unscheduled visits. Data from early termination and unscheduled visits 
will be summarized based on mapped visit values.  The analysis windows for early termination 
and unscheduled visits are presented in the following table.  
Analysis Wi ndows for Efficacy and Safety Assessments  
Scheduled Visit  Target Study Day  Window (Days)  
Week 2  15 13 to 17  
Week 6  43 40 to 46  
Week 8  57 54 to 60  
Week 10  71 68 to 74  
Week 12  85 82 to 88  
Week 14  99 92 to 106  
 
Data collected at early termination and unsched uled visits prior to study day 13  will not be 
analyzed, with the exception of those identified as Baseline  values. Data collected at early 
termination and unsch eduled visits after study day 106 will not be included in analyses.  
The definition for th e study day included in each study window is defined as below:  
Study Day Prior to Day 1 = Visit Date – Baseline Date  
 Study Day On or After Day 1 = Visit Date – Baseline Date + 1 . 
 
   
Statistical Analysis Plan  for PellePharm, Inc.  Page 14 
Protocol Number: 926 -202 28Sep2017  
 
 If an assessment’s mapped visit is a visit at which the subject has data from a scheduled visit 
present, or if no analyses are planned for the assessment at the mapped visit, or if the data maps 
to a time period not covered by [CONTACT_692181], the data collected at the early termination or 
unscheduled visit will not be included in analy ses.   
In the event of multiple values from unscheduled or early termination assessments within an 
analysis window, the value closest to the scheduled visit target study day will be used for 
analyses  (assuming there were no results from the scheduled visit  present) .  If two values tie as 
closest to the time point (for example, one value is before and the other value is after the time 
point), then the later value will be selected.  
Data collected at all visits will be included in the data listings  with visit presented as reported by 
[CONTACT_779] . 
6.1.[ADDRESS_938956] (LOCF) for the secondary  endpoint of tumor size  as assessed by [CONTACT_093] .  
Specifically, if a single diameter is missing then that SEB’s previous measurement will be 
carried for ward. The analysis will also be performed without imputation of missing data. For the 
secondary endpoint of GLI1, no missing data will be imputed.   
6.1.6 Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring  
As stated in the protocol, i f determined appropriate by [CONTACT_1034], li mited safety and efficacy 
interim analysis on  tumor shrinkage and biomarkers may be performed.

Protocol Number: [ADDRESS_938957] biomarker results, the database will be used to repo rt on limited safety and efficacy 
results. The sponsor and the CRO (QST) will be unblinded at this time. Site staff will remain 
blinded.  
6.1.7 Multicenter Studies  
The study will be conducted at one metasite in the [LOCATION_002] with the intention of pooling the 
results for analysis.  
6.1.8 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity  
Not applicable. Inferential tests will not be performed.  
6.1.9 Use of an Efficacy Subset of Subjects  
A Per Protocol population is defined below.

Not applicable to this study.  
6.1.11  Examination of Subgroups  
Not applicable to this study.  
6.2 Disposition of Subjects  
The number of subjects included in each analysis population (ITT, S afety , and Per  Protocol ) will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  The number of subje cts randomized, completed, and 
discontinued (including the reasons for discontinuation) will be summarized for each treatment 
group.  
Reasons for exclusion  from study populations will be included in a by -subject listing .

Protocol Number: 926 -202 28Sep2017  
 
 6.4 Data Sets Analyzed  
6.4.1 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
All subjects who are rando mized and dispensed study drug will be included in the ITT analysis 
set. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment group they were randomized.  All 
efficacy analyses will be presented using the ITT population  and the Per Protocol population . 
6.4.[ADDRESS_938959] -baseline safety assessment will be included in the safety analysis set.  All safety 
analyses will be according to the treatment actual ly received.  
6.4.3 Per Protocol (PP) Population  
All subjects in the ITT population who complete the Week 12 evaluation without any significant 
protocol violations will be included in the PP population and analyzed according to the treatment 
group they received.  The PP population will include subjects in the safety  population who do 
not meet any of the following criteria:  
• Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medication;  
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit;  
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen , between 80% to 120%  
• Had samples with insufficient BCC  
• Had tumors where the diameter was incorrectly measured based on review of 
photographs  
Subjects that discontinue from the study due to an adverse event related to stud y treatment or 
documented lack of treatment effect will be included in the PP population.  Prior to breaking the 
blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events 
that occurred during the conduct of the trial th at result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
Efficacy analyses performed on a by -tumor basis will include tumors from subjects who are not 
excluded for any of the above reasons.  
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population  as well a s on the PP population . 
 
   
Statistical Analysis Plan  for PellePharm, Inc.  Page 17 
Protocol Number: 926 -202 28Sep2017  
 
 6.5 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
All baseline summaries will be done on the ITT population.  
Sex, race, and ethnicity will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335].  Age, height (cm), and 
weight (kg) will be summarized w ith descriptive statistics.   
Medical histories will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary and presented in a by -subject 
listing.  
6.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_692165] 
(ATC) classification of ingredients using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug dictionary  
(WHO -DDE). 
A by -subject listing of all prior and concomitant medications will be presented. Medications that 
start prior to first dose but continue after the first dose will be considered a concomitant 
medication. Medications that are unable to be classified as either prior or concomitant due to 
missing data will not be considered a concomitant medication.   
6.7 Analys is of Efficacy  
All efficacy analysis will be done on both the ITT and PP populations.  
6.7.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary  endpoint of change in GLI1 mRNA levels will be evaluated with an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group as factor and baseline value as covariate.  Analysis 
is on a by [CONTACT_190799] r level. Pairwise comparisons  as well as any treated (combining all patidegib 
groups) versus vehicle  will be performed using contrasts within the ANCOVA.  
Additionally, if number of results is sufficient, a t -test will be done to perform pairwise 
comparison s of change in GLI1 mRNA levels of each treatment group with vehicle  (and 
combined patidegib versus vehicle) .  If assumptions required for a t -test are not met, then a Mann 
Whitney U test will be performed.  
Data will be summarized by [CONTACT_765]. B oth change from baseline and percent change from baseline 
will be presented.  
This analysis will be done for 2 regions (1) BCC and (2) BCC + tumor -associated stroma.  
No imputation on GLI1 data will be performed.

Response as determined by [CONTACT_692182] a 2 -sided 
Fisher’s Exact test. This analysis will be performed on all available data with no imputation of 
missing data.   Both pairwise comparisons between treatment groups and all treated (combining 
all patidegib groups) versus vehicle will be done.  
The second secondary  endpoint , the greatest diameter of all treatment targeted BCCs , will be 
evaluated similarly to the primary endpoint .This analysis will be performed using LOCF 
imputation as well as ‘as observed’ ( i.e. no imputation of missing data ).  
6.7.3 Exploratory Efficacy Analysis  
The exploratory  endpoint of investigator static global tumor assessment (ISGTA)  will be  
summarized by [CONTACT_692183] a by [CONTACT_692184] . Proportion with success as defined by [CONTACT_692185]/Almost 
Clear will be provided.   Results will be  analyzed with a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test .  
Tumor area will be evaluated with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group as 
factor and baseline value as covariate.  Analysis is on a by [CONTACT_692184]. Pairwise comparisons  as 
well as any treated (combining all patidegib groups) versus vehicle  will be performed using 
contrasts within the ANCOVA.  
The proportio n of baseline treated tumors are smaller at each study visit based on photographic 
review will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] . Results will be analyzed between groups and all 
treated (combining all patidegib groups) versus vehicle with a  CMH test.  Tumor area will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_765].

6.8.2 Adverse Events  
All AEs that occur during the study w ill be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Treatment -emergent A es (TEAEs) 
are defined as A es with an onset on or after the date of the first study drug application. Adverse 
events noted  prior to the first study drug administration that worsen after Baseline will also be 
reported as A es and included in the summaries.  
Treatment -emergent A es will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], the number of subjects 
reporting a TEAE, SOC, preferred term , severity, relationship to study drug (causality), and 
seriousness. When summarizing A es by [CONTACT_42564], each subject will be counted 
once within a system organ class or a preferred term by [CONTACT_692186].  
If relationship to study drug is reported as unknown, possible, probable or definite, then this is 
defined as related.  If relationship to study drug is reported as unlikely or not related, then this is 
defined as unrelated.  
Serious A es will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], severity and relationship to study drug.  
Listings will be presented for all adverse events as well as for serious adverse events and adverse 
events leading to study drug withdrawal.

Lay Summary of Proposed  Research 
Lay Summary of Proposed Research
The current  guidelines for buprenorphine (BUP)  treatment advocate an open  ended,  long-term maintenance 
approach. However, many  individuals initiating  treatment  with BUP, particularly youth  and those with  brief 
history of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_885527], expect a short treatment epi[INVESTIGATOR_885528]. As such, many  patients  that responded favorably to  treatment  intend  to 
discontinue medication, whether by [CONTACT_885612], or by a  route  of physician-directed BUP 
taper. However, it is  not known what is a  best strategy to assure a successful BUP discontinuation without

the risk of relapse. 
We propose an open--label  randomized outpatient  trial to evaluate feasibility and
efficacy of rapid buprenorphine (BUP)  discontinuation followed by [CONTACT_885613]-
-acting naltrexone (XR--NTX) and to compare  it to the standard method of gradual BUP taper.
Individuals with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) (N=60) who have successfully completed  at least [ADDRESS_1239005] phase  includes a 4--week  period of stabilization on buprenorphine 2--8  mg at the 
research clinic to assure that patients are stable, compliant, and  free from illicit  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  Participants  that 
meet the above criteria will  be randomized 1:1 to: 1) buprenorphine discontinuation and outpatient transition  
to XR--NTX with 3 monthly  injections,  or 2) buprenorphine discontinuation using a  gradual 5-week long 
taper. In both groups participants will  receive weekly relapse prevention therapy and will be  monitored for  
the duration of the trial, which is  [ADDRESS_1239006] randomization. 
The primary outcome will be  the percent  of patients  successfully transitioned off buprenorphine and 
abstinent from any opi[INVESTIGATOR_885529] 25--week trial  endpoint. Secondary outcomes will include measures  of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351],  mood, anxiety and sleep  problems,  abstinence  from  other substances, time to relapse or  
dropout, and  adverse  effects. We  hypothesize  that more patients  will successfully discontinue buprenorphine 
in the group  that received XR--NTX.  
This proposed  exploratory trial will be  able  to inform the design of future research  and clinical work.  
 
 
Background, Significance  and Rationale
Background, Significance and RationaleThe number  of individuals with Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2442]  (OUD) continues to  rise with more than  2.[ADDRESS_1239007] buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP)  is becoming  a treatment  of choice in the  primary  
care setting. As many  patients who had good treatment response desire  to discontinue the  medication  there 
is a need  for evidence on the best strategy  to accomplish that. We propose to  evaluate whether  an addition of 
a short course of a long--acting, injectable  naltrexone  (XR--NTX) improves the chances  of successful  BUP  
discontinuation and  transition to sustained abstinence off all  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].
The current  guidelines for BUP treatment advocate an  open ended, long--term  maintenance approach.
However, many individuals initiating treatment with BUP  expect a time--limited and  short treatment,  a
“detoxification--like” experience  rather than  “methadone--like  maintenance treatment,” and are 
disappointed that treatment is protracted and may  even be indefinite. This  is especially relevant for youth  
and those with brief history of addiction to prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. More  than 60% of patients maintained on 
BUP or methadone expressed interest in discontinuing medication in  the near future and more than 70% 
have previously tried  that (Winstock et al., 2011). It  is not known how  many patients with  a positive 
treatment response  are interested in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_885530] (Fiellin et  al., 2008). It is not well understood to  what extent withdrawal--like symptoms 
play a role in  relapse and  how  the addition of a brief course of naltrexone may influence the severity of 
Protocol Summary  Form
[ADDRESS_1239008] on the field  considering that up to 1 million  patients are treated with BUP every year.
 
Benefits of and challenges associated with buprenorphine discontinuation
Determining when and how individuals can  be safely  tapered from BUP  using a “planned approach” has 
several potential  benefits. First, patients may feel encouraged that they may be  able to discontinue treatment 
in the near future and  therefore will be  less likely to discontinue it unilaterally. Second,  patients who  do not 
need to be maintained on BUP indefinitely and are taken off it, will have lower risk of medication--related adverse effects and have lower treatment cost. Third,  in areas  of the  country where BUP  providers have 
reached the limits  of prescribing  for [ADDRESS_1239009]  
implemented lifetime limits on prescriptions  for BUP, ranging from 12 to  36 months (Rinaldo and Rinaldo, 
2013), and a strategy that  can shorten BUP treatment without compromising outcome may help patients in 
those states.
 
The main challenge to BUP discontinuation is that many patients experience significant  and protracted
discomfort, withdrawal--like symptoms with increase in craving  as well  as mood anxiety and sleep 
disruptions (Dunn et al.,  2015). These  symptoms emerge even as the dose is being gradually reduced.  As a  
result, many will abandon the attempt at discontinuation and resume BUP maintenance. If the patient stops medication on  their own, and cannot  easily resume  treatment, they may relapse to  illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Therefore, 
the question of how to discontinue treatment in patients who favorably responded to  BUP is of high 
significance to the  field as it may address  several important questions with  clinical relevance.
Specific Aims and Hypotheses
Specific Aims and  Hypotheses
The primary outcome will be  the percent  of patients  successfully transitioned off buprenorphine
and abstinent from any opi[INVESTIGATOR_885529] 25--week  trial endpoint.
 
Secondary outcomes will include measures of opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351],  mood,  anxiety and sleep problems, 
abstinence from other substances,  time  to relapse or dropout, and adverse  effects.
 
Additionally we  will examine in biofluid derived extracellular vesicle content for the existence of 
biomarkers related to naltrexone  treatment.   
 
We hypothesize that  more patients will successfully discontinue buprenorphine in
the group that  received XR--NTX.

Study Procedures
Describe the procedures required for this study
This is  an open-label  randomized outpatient  trial to compare the safety and efficacy of two methods of  
transitioning patients off BUP.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent individuals who have  successfully completed at least [ADDRESS_1239012] stage (led-in phase) participants will be maintained on their usual dose of BUP  (2-8 mg)  at the 
research clinic for 1 month to assure  that they are stable, compliant, and  free from illicit  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  Following 
that, participants will be randomly  assigned to begin treatment with  one of two regimens: 1) rapid BUP 
discontinuation and  transition to XR-NTX, or 2) 5-week long BUP taper. Participants  randomized to  XR-
NTX will receive a total of [ADDRESS_1239013]-randomization.  During  months  4-6 participants will be seen twice

monthly for therapy and monitoring. The  primary outcome will be a binary indicator of discontinuation 
success, the percent of patients  successfully  transitioned off BUP and abstinent from opi[INVESTIGATOR_885536], 25 weeks after  randomization. We hypothesize that success rate will be greater  in patients that 
received treatment with XR-NTX.
 Setting and Screening: This study will be conducted at the BSU clinic at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_885537]-dependent subjects using similar methodology. A 
combination of radio, print, and Internet advertising will be  directed  at prospective participants in the New 
York metropolitan area. Screening procedures are standardized for clinical trials  including a telephone 
interview, the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview, psychiatric evaluation, medical  history,  
physical and laboratory  examination. The research psychiatrist will offer eligible individuals participation in 
the study and will obtain  informed consent.
 Randomization. We predict  that 50 participants (out of 60 enrolled) will complete  lead-in phase successfully 
and will be available for  randomization. The 1:1 randomization will be  stratified by [CONTACT_885620] (4 mg/d vs. greater than 4 mg/d) and the type  of the  primary  drug (prescription  opi[INVESTIGATOR_595891].  heroin) 
distributing these potential  prognostic factors equally between groups to  ensure
comparable representation. The  randomization sequence will be carried out by a research pharmacist, 
balanced in random blocks to protect  allocation  concealment.
 
Regimen 1 will  include a rapid Monday  to Friday oral naltrexone-induction procedure: last dose of BUP on  
Sat, Sun-Mon  0 mg, Tue 1 mg, Wed 3 mg, Thu 6 mg dose of oral  NTX  respectively. On Friday, a final  25 
mg dose of  oral NTX  will be given followed  by [CONTACT_885621]-NTX (Vivitrol; 380 mg  IM). All doses  
of oral NTX  will be given in a single or  split  doses depending on patients’ tolerability of  the protocol.  
Throughout the induction  adjuvant medications will be  administered  on standing basis: clonidine 0.[ADDRESS_1239014].  
 
Procedures for Missed Doses of Long-acting Naltrexone:Missing a  scheduled Vivitrol injection is
the most important  threat to the success  of long-acting naltrexone maintenance. In the event of a
patient missing a  scheduled injection,  the clinic  staff  will immediately attempt to  contact [CONTACT_885622]-
establish commitment  to the naltrexone treatment and reschedule the injection within a 48-hour period, or as 
soon as possible thereafter, based on clinical judgement( i.e., after  a clinical assessment and  naloxone 
challenge if indicated). If  the patient cannot  attend the treatment clinic within that time-frame, or cannot be 
located, the treatment  team will use previously obtained locator information in an effort to locate the patient 
through emergency contacts and  get him/her in for a  clinic visit. If opi[INVESTIGATOR_885538]  a 
missed Vivitrol injection, a naloxone  challenge  will be administered to  confirm that  the next long-acting 
naltrexone injection will  be safely  tolerated. 
Regimen 2 will  include a 5-week BUP  taper from the maintenance dose of 8, 6, 4, or 2mg (wk  1: 6, 5, 3 
2mg/d, wk 2: 4, 4 or 2 mg/d, wk 3: 3, 3 or 2 mgd/, wk 4:  2 mg/d, wk  5: 1 mg/d). A  buprenorphine/naloxone  
generic product will  be used.  Participants  will be offered adjuvant medications, which will be  administered 
on standing basis: clonidine  0.[ADDRESS_1239015] 4ml of  saliva, 50ml of urine, and  4, 6-7ml  blood  from  subjects at baseline,  after  
randomization ([ADDRESS_1239016] injection of XR-NTX, or  1 week after completing bup taper), during  
post randomization  month 2 (  1 week after 2nd XR-NTX injection, or 4 weeks  after completion of bup 
taper), and at end of study  to be examined for biomarkers. From  these we will isolate extracellular 
vesicle-containing pellets  and evaluate their  contents using advanced -OMICs analyses, in order to 
identify molecular signatures that  differ across subjects before  and after ending treatment with 
buprenorphine.
 
Study blinding.  All participants will receive open-label medication  as this is an effectiveness trial of two 
different regimens for  managing patients discontinuing BUP treatment, tested as they would be  used  in 
community-based clinical  treatment.
 Psychotherapy platform. Following study enrollment, all participants will be offered  weekly  therapy,  
delivered by a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], that will follow the  Community Reinforcement Approach:  CRA (Budney and  
Higgins, 2000). CRA  is a skills oriented  treatment that emphasizes  building a lifestyle which  increases the  
opportunities for alternative reinforcers to drug use. CRA has been  a central  component of the behavioral 
treatment program developed by [CONTACT_885623] 
(Nunes et al., 2006; Rothenberg et  al., 2002; Sullivan et al.,  2015) and  we have  extensive experience 
implementing this  flexible  treatment protocol and  assuring treatment fidelity. We will offer the following 
modules: Building and enhancing social support network; Social  skills  and relationship enhancement 
training; Management of  mood and emotions; Increasing pleasant  activities; Job-seeking skills;  and 
Termination (Rothenberg et al., 2002). We will also  incorporate a contingency reinforcement  schedule to 
reinforce clinic visits to increase frequency  of outcomes collection. As patients progress in treatment, we  
will support patient-directed recovery plan  focusing on individual’s strengths to  build meaningful and 
satisfying life and  we will proactively link patients  to recovery support resources. We have  been 
implementing evidence-based therapy in our clinic  for close  to [ADDRESS_1239017] training, supervision, and treatment  fidelity assurance  (e.g. recording of therapy sessions).
 Outpatient Study Visits and Assessments will occur weekly during  the period of  BUP  maintenance and 
taper to ensure adherence and to monitor for  abstinence. Study  visits  will take  place  daily  during XR-NTX 
induction and weekly following injection  naltrexone or BUP  taper in  both regimens for the remainder of the 
study period.  Once  per week  participants  will meet with  a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_885539]. They 
will have scheduled meetings with a  study psychiatrist  weekly  to inquire about medication effects and any  
changes in their medical/psychological condition following  medication  discontinuation.  
 Evaluation of Depression and Anxiety  symptoms:  Participants who meet  criteria  for a Mood  Disorder 
(MDD) of  mild  to moderate severity  or an  Anxiety Disorder will be  followed closely during detoxification  
and subsequently.  Mood and anxiety will be assessed  both in therapy sessions and during  MD visits. If  a 
Protocol Summary  Form
[ADDRESS_1239018] following detoxification, we will offer the 
participant the option of beginning an antidepressant  or an  anti-anxiety  treatment if  deemed  clinically 
warranted. Managing controlled substances: Currently  the study is run under the NYS Controlled Substance license  # 
0400081 held by [CONTACT_885624] # PN0093461 held by [CONTACT_40422]

develop serious  psychiatric symptomatology (e.g.,  psychosis, suicidal  ideation,  severe depressive
symptoms) during the study period will be  dropped  from the study and appropriate clinical referrals will
be made. A patient who's  continued opi[INVESTIGATOR_885543]-destructive behavior or
otherwise places them  at significant risk will be discontinued from the study. This  would include,  but not be 
limited to,  patients  who become unconscious  after using, engage in  destructive or violent behavior while 
intoxicated, report driving  while  intoxicated,  or develop medical complications from their  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. In  all 
cases where subjects are discontinued from  the study, the clinical research staff will assume clinical  
responsibility for the  subjects until clinical  referrals are operational.
In case that the  patient  is removed from the  research  trial for medical reasons,  or is requesting
withdrawal from the study, he/she will be  retained in open treatment for the remaining study period.
Upon removal of  a patient from the trial due  to clinical deterioration, the patient will be referred for
appropriate follow-up treatment, in most instances  either intensive outpatient or residential  treatment.
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a study psychiatrist is available  24 hours/day by [CONTACT_17084]/or beeper in case of emergency.
 
 
If a patient is  discontinued from the  study, or decides  to withdraw,  or relapses  during  study the participation,  
the patient will  get treated with buprenorphine  until they are  linked  with  a referral for continuing  
buprenorphine treatment.  Participants will receive a one-week supply of buprenorphine at a time during  the 
transition process.   
 
 
Blood and other Biological Samples
Please create or insert  a table describing  the proposed collection  of blood or other biological specimens
Urine samples will be collected  at every  visit, and we will use onsite testing  to provide immediate feedback 
on opi[INVESTIGATOR_885544]. Blood  chemistry will be  obtained  at baseline and end 
of study (week  25). Urine  Pregnancy tests will be obtained at baseline,  at once monthly  (or prior  to 
administration of XR-NTX).
 
We will collect 4ml of  saliva, 50ml of urine, and  4, 6-7ml  blood  from  subjects at Baseline, after 
randomization ([ADDRESS_1239019] injection of XR-NTX, or  1 week after completing bup taper), during  
post randomization  month 2 (  1 week after 2nd XR-NTX injection, or 4 weeks  after completion of bup 
taper), and at end of study  to be examined for biomarkers. From  these we will isolate extracellular 
vesicle-containing pellets  and evaluate their  contents using advanced -OMICs analyses, in order to 
identify molecular signatures that  differ across subjects before  and after ending treatment with 
buprenorphine.

Assessment Instruments
Create a table or give a brief  description  of the  instruments  that will be used for assessment
Physiological Measures
Medical History  and Physical Exam: A comprehensive medical history  and physical examination will be 
performed during the screening process. All potential participants will be offered the opportunity  to be 
referred to receive free  HIV risk reduction  education,  as well as HIV  testing  and counseling.
 
Pregnancy Testing: Serum pregnancy testing will be performed on all females during screening and urine
pregnancy tests will be  performed at baseline and monthly afterwards.
 
Serum laboratory  examination: Complete blood count, electrolyte, and liver  function tests will be 
performed during the screening process and  at the end of study.
 
Urinalysis: Laboratory urinalysis (glucose, protein, ketones, pH,  specific  gravity,  and microscopic analysis) 
will be performed  during the screening process and at the end  of study.
 
Urine Toxicology: Urine samples will be collected under directly--observed conditions  during screening 
and at each study visit.  To provide  immediate feedback to  the participant, the  Abuscreen On--Trak system 
([COMPANY_002] Diagnostics) will be used to identify  opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (morphine, oxycodone, buprenorphine,  methadone). In  
addition, the sample will  be analyzed for substances  of abuse,  including THC, alcohol,  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], cocaine, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], amphetamines,  and barbiturates.
Vital Signs: Temperature, pulse, and  blood pressure will be measured at every study visit for data collection 
and safety monitoring purposes. Height and  weight will be measured and baseline body mass index (BMI) 
calculated during screening. Weight will be recorded  and monitored at  each visit throughout the study 
period.
Interviews
Clinical Global  Impression Scale--Observer  (CGI): The CGI Severity and  CGI Improvement scales 
(Guy, 1976) will  be used to measure the overall  clinical status  of the participant as well as change from 
baseline in symptom  severity, functional  impairment, and psychiatric symptoms. The CGI Improvement  
scale will be used to determine whether a participant  needs  to be discontinued from  the study  and provided 
with an appropriate  clinical referral.
Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM--D):  This is the standard clinician--rated instrument used to  assess
depressive symptoms in clinical trials to assess baseline severity and changes associated  with  treatment. We 
use a 25--item, structured  interview version (SIGH--D--DES)  that incorporates the reverse vegetative 
symptoms of  the atypi[INVESTIGATOR_885545]  (Williams, 1988),  but permits calculation  of 
the standard 17-- and  21--item scores imbedded in the  scale. In addition to  mood symptoms,  the HAM--D 
has items that measure  anxiety, irritability, and insomnia, which are symptoms of interest  for this study. The 
HAM--D will be  performed at baseline  and twice  per month thereafter throughout the  trial.
Hamilton Anxiety Scale  (HAM--A): The HAM--A is a standard clinician--rated instrument used to assess 
Protocol Summary  Form
7522
Bisaga, Adam
Page 15 of 30
the severity of anxiety symptoms (Maier et al., 1988). The scale consists of 14 items, measuring  both 
psychic anxiety and somatic anxiety.  The HAM--A  will be  preformed  at baseline and and  twice per month 
thereafter throughout the trial.
The MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (Sheehan et  al., 1998) will be  performed  
during screening  as part of a complete psychiatric diagnostic assessment.
Structured Medication Count Interview is a Timeline Follow--Back assessment of study medicationcompliance accounting for each  dose of prescribed  study  medication  during the study period. Structured pi[INVESTIGATOR_885546].
 
Systematic Assessment for Treatment and Emergent Events (SAFTEE):  The SAFTEE as modified for 
Project COMBINE  (Johnson  et al.,  2005) will be performed weekly, and twice-monthly  during  study 
months 4-[ADDRESS_1239020]  the symptom as well as the date of onset, severity,  and 
resolution (if applicable) and research psychiatrist will  review it at least weekly and more frequently if 
symptoms are present.
Timeline Follow--Back  (TLFB): The Timeline  Followback method  (Litten and Allen, 1992) will gather 
self-- reported opi[INVESTIGATOR_885547]. The TLFB confirmed  by [CONTACT_885628].
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_885548] (TCL): The  number  and duration of treatment sessions will be documented  by [CONTACT_137335][INVESTIGATOR_292415] a  contact  [CONTACT_26500].
End of Study Form (ESF):  At study completion  or the point of termination  for patients who  relapse or 
drop out, the research psychiatrist fills out an  End of Study Form, which  indicates whether or  not a patient  
completed [ADDRESS_1239021]  to follow--up.
 
Self--Report
Clinical Global  Impression--Self (CGI--S): The CGI--Self is a two--item scale that asks  the subject to  rate 
his or her current  level of  symptoms and estimate  changes from  baseline  (Guy,  1976). The  CGI--S will 
serve as  the primary self--reported  measure  of overall functioning.
Medical Outcomes Study—Sleep Scale (MOS--SS):  The MOS--SM is a 12--item measure for 
characterizing the  quality  of sleep (Hays  et al., 2005). Opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351],  both  acute and protracted is 
characterized by [CONTACT_885629]. The MOS--SM  will be  the primary outcome of 
sleep quality and length and will be  collected at each visit.
Craving Scales-- Self:  A visual analog  scales is used for patients to rate the intensity of craving for opi[INVESTIGATOR_885549] (Bisaga et al., 2011).
Protocol Summary  Form
[ADDRESS_1239022] (SSTAT)-- Self: The SSTAT  is a well--validated measure of 
anxiety consisting of two self--rated subscales, one rating Trait anxiety  and the other  State  anxiety 
(Spi[INVESTIGATOR_885550]., 1970).
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)--  Self: The BDI is a 21--item self--report questionnaire. It has been used 
in many studies and  validly and reliably  assesses depression in  many patient  groups including substance 
abusers (Beck et al.,  1996) and it will be collected weekly, and twice-monthly during study months  4-6.
Subjective Opi[INVESTIGATOR_136472] (SOWS)-- Self: The SOWS is a 19--item self--report scale reliably 
eliciting severity of common physical  and mental symptoms  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2533], and  also yielding a total  
withdrawal severity score (Handelsman et al., 1987).  It will be used to examine  occurrence  of symptoms 
resembling opi[INVESTIGATOR_885551].
Locator Form-- Self: In order  to facilitate the  location of drop--outs for follow--up evaluation, a standard 
location form  will be administered at baseline and updated monthly.  This indicates names, addresses and 
phone numbers of family members  and close friends likely to know  patients' whereabouts  along with  
permission to contact [CONTACT_127744].

Clinical Treatment Alternatives
Clinical treatment alternativesThe major alternatives for long-term treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885552]  "drug-free"  treatment  on either an
outpatient or residential  basis,  or agonist  maintenance with methadone or buprenorphine, all available by
[CONTACT_6018]. Other options available in the  community include either hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based detoxification (often 
agonist-assisted) to a  "drug-free" state, which  is available to  the patients by [CONTACT_6018], or outpatient methadone 
detoxification, which  is available at some methadone clinics. Regardless of treatment,  the risk of relapse to 
illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_885553]-based relapse 
prevention treatment. XR-naltrexone is FDA-approved for relapse prevention treatment  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885554].During the initial informed consent process,  patients will be  informed about alternative treatments and their 
availability, and that they  are free to choose  among the options, at baseline or  at any  time during the study.
Risks/Discomforts/Inconveniences 
Risks that  could be  encountered during the study period
Side Effects, Risks, and Interactions of BuprenorphineBuprenorphine has  been associated with adverse effects typi[INVESTIGATOR_885555] (e.g. sedation,
constipation, insomnia, headache, nausea), although  as a partial  agonist such effects  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_885556] a  full agonist. The most common adverse  event associated with the
sublingual administration is oral  hypoesthesia. Other  adverse  events  were  constipation, headache,  
intoxication, disturbance in attention, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], insomnia,  sweating,  and blurred  vision. Buprenorphine 
by [CONTACT_885630][INVESTIGATOR_885557]  a low risk of overdose, a safety 
advantage. However, there is a risk of overdose if buprenorphine is  combined  with  sedative drugs  such as 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_33528], analogous to the risk of combining such sedating  medications  with  a full 
agonist like methadone. As a partial agonist, buprenorphine can precipi[INVESTIGATOR_885558] 12--[ADDRESS_1239024] extensive  experience,  in both research  and

clinical settings,  in administering buprenorphine  and in the management of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801]. 
The use of  buprenorphine is also associated with the risk of using the medication for the purposes of 
intoxication. In the present study we will use  buprenorphine/naloxone combination product, which has 
lower abuse liability. If  sublingual buprenorphine is  used parenterally, there is a risk of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_885559]. Such  an event, if  it were to occur, would be short--lived and  not life threatening.  Participants 
will be warned of this risk and advised not to  use the medication in this  manner. If it is determined  that 
patients have been abusing  their buprenorphine in such a  manner, they will be declared to have failed BUP 
discontinuation, and  a new treatment plan  will be developed by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical team, with  possibilities 
including transfer to naltrexone or methadone maintenance. To minimize  the risk of diversion, medication 
will be dispensed for short time intervals  (1--2  weeks of medication at a time).
Buprenorphine is metabolized principally by [CONTACT_097]3A4. Co--administration of other CYP3A4 inhibitors  (e.g. 
anti-- retrovirals  efavirenz, delavirdine, atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir;; the anti--fungal agent 
ketoconazole;; antibiotics erythromycin  or clarithromycin) may cause  an increase in systemic  levels of 
buprenorphine, although  this does not usually  have clinically significant effects. When  a patient being 
prescribed buprenorphine  is also receiving other medications, the  prescribing  physician will check for 
potential interactions ahead of  time and monitor during treatment.
 
Side Effects of Extended--Release (XR),  Injectable  Naltrexone
The most common side effect associated with injectable naltrexone is injection site reaction.  XR-naltrexone 
is administered as a gluteal  intramuscular  injection  and injection site reactions,  mostly pain, and occur in  
approximately 5% of patients in opi[INVESTIGATOR_885560]. These reactions are  generally mild and include 
pain, tenderness, indurations, bruising, pruritus and swelling. Generally  these  reactions last 1--[ADDRESS_1239025] an abscess,  necrosis, cellulitis or extensive swelling, an appropriate 
surgical referral  will be  made.
Naltrexone has been associated with reversible  hepatocellular injury indicated by [CONTACT_885631] 380 mg im per month, dose recommended for 
relapse prevention treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885561]. When used in 
therecommended dose range in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573]--dependent patients, this risk is remote  (Brahen et al., 1988;; Brewer 
and Wong, 2004). Naltrexone is therefore contraindicated  in patients with  acute  hepatitis  or liver failure,  and 
such patients are excluded from the study. Patients with hepatic enzyme levels greater  than three times the 
upper imit of normal are excluded. Injectable  naltrexone achieves  higher blood levels than oral naltrexone 
initially, but these should  remain lower than  levels associated with hepatitis. If naltrexone--induced hepatitis 
were to occur in the  setting of long--acting preparation, where the naltrexone would be only very slowly 
eliminated, this would prolong  exposure to the offending agent. However, the experience with injectable  
naltrexone also suggests it is safe. In our studies with extended--release naltrexone several  patients 
experienced elevation  in liver enzymes, which were determined  to be related to  hepatitis C. In the proposed 
study we will use a  long--acting, injectable  preparation of naltrexone (Vivitrol  380 mg).
Several recent reports have documented that naltrexone pose significantly lower risk of hepatotoxicity  than  
previously suspected, even  among  alcohol--  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]--dependent persons  including those with  HCV 
and/or HIV  infection (Lucey et  al., 2008;; Mitchell et al., 2012;; Tetrault  et al., 2012;; Vagenas et al., 2014). 
These reports were  used  to support decision taken by [CONTACT_885632] [ADDRESS_1239026] frequently in association with XR--naltrexone  treatment 
for opi[INVESTIGATOR_885562], insomnia  and toothache (Vivitrol;; Package Insert).  
During the outpatient phase of the  study,  if a patient misses scheduled injection of Vivitrol and  resumes 
regular opi[INVESTIGATOR_544602], then receiving injectable  naltrexone will precipi[INVESTIGATOR_885563],  which may be 
quite severe in proportion  to the time since  the last injection and the level of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9825].  The 
physician will  evaluate the patient and  perform  a naloxone challenge  test to  determine whether or not  
naltrexone can be safely resumed. If the  naloxone  challenge is positive  (withdrawal is precipi[INVESTIGATOR_135162]), then the 
patient will be  removed  from the study and offered another treatment option such as agonist maintenance 
(buprenorphine or methadone) according to clinical judgment and  the patient’s  preferences.
Self--administration of large doses of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885564]--ride the blockade  produced by [CONTACT_885633][INVESTIGATOR_885565].  Patients will be 
warned of  the severe  danger of using opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], including trying to  over--ride  the blockade. Also  patients who 
have topped naltrexone and resume  opi[INVESTIGATOR_885566],  so that the quantities  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885567]-
- administered prior to treatment, when  they were tolerant, may be  quite dangerous in the non--tolerant  state. 
Patients will be  warned of this. Patients who self--administer opi[INVESTIGATOR_885568]. In the event of a  medical  emergency 
requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_649353],  a patient  on naltrexone will require higher doses  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885569]. Patients  will be informed  of this  and will be given a naltrexone medication card to carry  in 
their wallet.
 
 Risks of  the Rapid Naltrexone Induction Procedure:
In this procedure withdrawal is then precipi[INVESTIGATOR_885570] (an  alpha--2--adrenergic receptor agonist which reduces  sympathetic nervous  system output 
produced by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_2533]), clonazepam (a  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_885571]) and  other adjunctive  medications. In the proposed protocol the risk of severe withdrawal 
has been  minimized by [CONTACT_885634]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_885572], 
elevated pulse and blood pressure  and other signs of sympathetic arousal,  and sometimes confusion. 
Clonidine may  produce somnolence or hypotension. Clonazepam commonly may produce somnolence. The 
procedure is contraindicated  in patients  with unstable medical  problems or histories of hypersensitivity to 
any of the medications used, and  these are exclusions  in the proposed study. The procedure  is conducted in 
the outpatient  setting that permits monitoring of patients for up to 8 hours daily to  permit close monitoring 
of vital  signs and  mental status.
PregnancyBuprenorphine and naltrexone are Pregnancy category C agents, although the safety of buprenorphine in pregnancy has been supported in clinical trials (Jones et al., 2010). Female participants  will be  required to  
use adequate  methods of  birth control (condom  with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide,  birth control 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]) to be included  in the study and will be strongly encouraged  to use more effective methods like a  
subdermal implant,  IUD, or a depot  contraceptive  injection. Serum pregnancy tests will be  evaluated at 
baseline and  urine for  pregnancy will be tested  as clinically indicated  during  treatment according to  standard 
clinical procedures. If a  female patient does  become  pregnant  she will be  withdrawn from study  medication  
and offered continuing treatment with methadone or buprenorphine, which remains the current treatment of choice for pregnant  opi[INVESTIGATOR_722616].

 Randomization to  injection naltrexone or buprenorphine taper
The implications of  random assignment to treatment  conditions will be  discussed  with  patients. One of the  
treatments could be more or less effective for a given patient. The alternative choices of continuingbuprenorphine maintenance outside of the study or injection naltrexone,  detoxification  and counseling 
without medication  (so called “drug--free”  treatment), will be  discussed with  patients, as well as options  of 
pursuing such treatments at other treatment  programs  available to  the patients  in the [LOCATION_001]  area.  These  
will be discussed with patients at the time of consent, and revisited if  Relapse occurs. Patients will also be 
informed, and reminded that the study is voluntary and that  they can  opt for any of these options  at any  
point during the  study.
AssessmentsThe structured interviews, rating scales,  and questionnaires should add  no physical risk. However, because 
many of the  interviews and assessments  are time--consuming to  complete and involve  topi[INVESTIGATOR_885573] a sensitive 
nature, some  people have found them to be physically or emotionally tiring. Patients  are informed  prior to  
study entry that they  can refuse to answer  any questions and  that they can request  to stop at any time. If a 
participant becomes agitated during any of the interviews or  assessments, he  or she will be provided with 
therapeutic assistance.
Blood TestsBlood drawing may  cause slight discomfort at  site of needle  entry, resulting in  a small  bruise.
 
 
Describe procedures  for minimizing risks
MonitoringAny study of medication  efficacy  carries risk. However, the investigators  have conducted a series of studies 
administering medications to patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427].  Further, [CONTACT_885653] has specifically 
conducted a study at the  clinic in which the outpatient method of rapid naltrexone induction  was developed. 
Other clinic  physicians have extensive experience in administering oral and injectable  naltrexone to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-
-dependent patients  as well as experience providing treatment with buprenorphine. Patients  are seen  weekly 
by a physician until month 4, and  twice-monthly  during months 4-6 for evaluation  of medication and  
side effects, medication compliance therapy,  or dose  adjustments or adverse effects, and  for evaluation of 
safety and emergence  of any safety related issues (e.g. pregnancy, clinical worsening including serious 
medical or  psychiatric conditions, or worsening of substance use).  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events will be carefully monitored during the  study.
 
Relapse during outpatient naltrexone induction
During the detoxification  phase of the study, particularly during  washout  day and during  first few days 
when naltrexone is introduced if a  patient  resumes regular opi[INVESTIGATOR_544602], then taking  naltrexone,  particularly 
naltrexone injection, may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_885563], which may be severe.  Patients will be warned  not to 
take the naltrexone if they  resumed any level of opi[INVESTIGATOR_15834], and opi[INVESTIGATOR_885574].

will be provided  with a 1--2 weeks  supply  of buprenorphine/naloxone throughout the study.
 
Criteria for  removal from the study will include:  include:
1) Development  of serious psychiatric symptoms as indicated by [CONTACT_87793] (CGI)  
improvement score of  6 (much worse than baseline) or greater  for 2 consecutive  weeks or psychiatric or 
medical deterioration that  cannot be managed safely in the context outpatient treatment offered at the study

participant, if he  or she agrees, will then inform  the individual that they may be contact[CONTACT_885638]. 
Only after the participant has informed the  individual about the possible  contact [CONTACT_885639].
 
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse  Events are carefully monitored during medication studies. The
physician queries the patient and log side effects and  other treatment  emergent events during the past  week, 
recording their severity, what action  was taken, and whether they are continuing or resolved.  NIDA/VA 
Serious Adverse Event Form and NIDA Serious Adverse Event Tracking and Reporting System (SAETRS, on line)  is used whenever a serious adverse event  occurs. The research  physician  evaluates  the patient, 
completes this form  detailing the event, and reports  the event immediately to  both  Investigators’ IRBs and 
to NIDA. SAETRS is  a web--based application that helps collect,  track,  store, analyze and report serious 
adverse events (SAETRS).
Methods to Protect Confidentiality
Describe methods  to protect confidentiality
Confidentiality
Patients will be  asked  to divulge information,  such as their  drug  use or legal, psychiatric or medical 
problems, which are sensitive and  could have  adverse social consequences if released. This would include 
information released to insurance companies,  family members, or made public in any way. Patient records 
are kept in locked files  and released only with the  patient's consent. We  will obtain a Federal Certificate  of 
Confidentiality to further safeguard  the confidentiality of the participants  enrolled in  the trial.  The 
Certificate of  Confidentiality will allow investigators  and others with access to research  records  to refuse to 
disclose information  that could identify subjects  in any civil, criminal, administrative,  legislative,  or other 
proceeding, whether at  the Federal,  State, or  local level. Contact [CONTACT_885640]'s express  consent. All computer data  are stored  without names  or other uncoded 
identification.
Will the  study be  conducted under  a certificate of confidentiality?
Yes, we will apply  for the Certificate of Confidentiality

patients with OUD, the  development of additional pharmacotherapy  options  would be of great  public health 
benefit. We  believe that measures described above to minimize risks for  participants make the balance 
between risk to participants and the potential benefit  to participants and others  reasonable.
Compensation and/or  Reimbursement  
Will compensation or reimbursement  for expenses  be offered to subjects?
YesPlease describe  and indicate total amount and schedule of  payment(s).  
Include justification for compensation amounts and indicate  if there are bonus  payments.
Contingency Management  and Subject Compensation: Subjects will be encouraged to come for
the clinical evaluations and for CBT sessions as described in  this protocol. To  minimize missed
sessions, they will be reimbursed for transportation  expenses, for providing data, and for time
spent in completing study assessments in accordance with local  site's IRB policies. Contingency
management procedures which have been shown to successfully improve  many  behaviors
ranging from medication  compliance to adherence to protocol activities will be  applied  to this
study. Subjects will earn chances at each visit to draw vouchers from a  prize-bowl.  A subject must
complete all visit  requirements to be able to draw vouchers at  the end  of a visit. If study medication is 
discontinued due to adverse events, subject  will continue to draw vouchers  based on the schedule below as  
long as they continue all other visit requirements  are completed. Participants will earn  one draw for  each 
consecutive visit made, with  a bonus 3 draws for every  3 consecutive weeks . If a participant misses a  visit,  
their draws  are reset. Each draw has a probabilistic chance of yielding one  of four outcomes; an  encouraging 
statement (e.g. ‘good job’), a  small prize  valued  at $2.50,  a large prize valued at $20, or a  jumbo prize 
valued at $100.  The probability of  each particular  outcome is fixed for every draw  and is based on the 
relative number  of slips  for each prize category  in the prize bowl. Using Petry et al.s (2005) framework each 
prize bowl  will have 500 prize slips.  250 slips will be an encouraging statement (50% of the total slips), 209 
will be for small prizes (41.8%), 40 slips  will be for  large prizes (8%),  and 10 slips will be the jumbo prize 
(0.2%). Patients will earn 1 additional  draw for every consecutive week of abstinence (all urine samples for 
a treatment week test negative).  The increasing number of earned draws  during the protocol follows the 
escalating incentive structure employed in other  CM based treatments (Higgins et al., 1993).  During the 
treatment (contingency management) subjects can earn up to  340 draws  from the prize bowl if 
demonstrating 100% attendance during the  25 weeks of the protocol. Total earnings will vary depending 
on attendance.  With an expected earning  of $2.85 per  draw  the maximum  potential  earnings for the CM for 
25 weeks is  $969.  However, actual observed earnings will be significantly less than the potential  maximum 
due to attrition and missed visits.

[ADDRESS_1239032] been successfully treated with buprenorphine and would like to stop taking buprenorphine. The main purpose of this research study is to evaluate two methods of buprenorphine discontinuation: a standard method of a graduated taper compared to a rapid discontinuation and transition onto Vivitrol.  This study is funded by a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).  Vivitrol is a long-acting injection that contains enough naltrexone to last up to one month; it is approved by [CONTACT_885641][INVESTIGATOR_2427]. It works by [CONTACT_885642][INVESTIGATOR_885582], but is not a controlled substance and has no opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-like effect itself. You are being asked to participate in this study because you are currently prescribed buprenorphine and meet other study entry criteria. If you are not eligible, you will be assisted in finding free or low-cost treatment services near your home. If you are eligible for the study, you will receive your current dose of buprenorphine for one month, and will be randomized to either a five-week gradual taper off buprenorphine, or a week long rapid taper followed by [CONTACT_885643]. You will receive individual therapy for [ADDRESS_1239033] your current or future treatment at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute or Columbia University Medical Center. You will be notified of significant new findings that may relate to your willingness to continue to participate.    III. Alternative Treatments/Alternatives to Participation   You do not need to participate in this research study to receive treatment for your opi[INVESTIGATOR_885583]. Other treatments are  available, including methadone maintenance, buprenorphine maintenance, inpatient or other outpatient detoxification programs, and "drug-free" treatments including outpatient counseling or residential or therapeutic community treatment.   IV. Procedures  Screening 
BUP DISCO Version 04.02.[ADDRESS_1239034] a cardiogram (a test to measure the electrical activity of your heart), blood tests, a physical exam, and a urine toxicology screen. After the initial screening visit(s), you will be told whether you may be eligible for this research treatment study. The screening process may take between a few days to a few weeks depending on the frequency of your visits. If you are not eligible, or if you are not interested in taking part in the research treatment, then the clinician will assist you in finding treatment for your problems elsewhere. If you are eligible for the study, you will come to the clinic once a week to receive your current dose of buprenorphine and for monitoring. At the end of this month you will be randomly assigned to one of two regimens of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_885584]: (Regimen 1) rapid discontinuation of buprenorphine followed by [CONTACT_885644] (Regimen 2) a gradual taper off of buprenorphine.   Regimen 1: Rapid Discontinuation + Vivitrol  You will begin your outpatient visits to the clinic at the beginning of the week, and you will be asked to come to the clinic daily ([ADDRESS_1239035] one hour each day) during this first week, in order to receive medications, naltrexone and other medications to reduce the discomfort of withdrawal from opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. At each outpatient visit, you will need to provide an observed urine sample, which will be tested for opi[INVESTIGATOR_885585].  You will have your blood pressure, heart rate, and rate of breathing checked by [CONTACT_20229].  The anti-withdrawal medication you will receive include: clonidine (a medicine used to treat high blood pressure), clonazepam (for anxiety), prochlorperazine (anti-nausea drug), and zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_401719] (for insomnia). If you experience significant withdrawal while at the clinic, you will be strongly encouraged to remain at the clinic for observation, and you may receive additional doses of medications.   If you are assigned to Regimen 1, you will be asked to stop taking buprenorphine and you will start taking medications to prevent withdrawal. Two days after the last dose of buprenorphine you will start taking naltrexone by [CONTACT_1966], first taking very low doses. If you do use buprenorphine or another opi[INVESTIGATOR_885586], you may receive a naloxone challenge to determine whether it is safe to continue with the rest of the dosing schedule.  At the end of the first week, you will receive an intramuscular injection of Vivitrol, a long-acting form of naltrexone that lasts in your system for 3-[ADDRESS_1239036] been evaluated for medical stability by [CONTACT_885645]/or psychiatrist. If you experience fatigue or medication side effects, car transportation home will be provided to you. After you have received Vivitrol, you will continue to come to the clinic once a week to meet with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_885587] [ADDRESS_1239037] injection.   Regimen 2: Gradual Taper  If you are assigned to Regimen 2, you will continue receiving buprenorphine on a weekly basis for five weeks, with the dose of buprenorphine gradually decreasing to minimize any possible withdrawal. At the end of the taper buprenorphine will be stopped.  During this time we ask that you come to the clinic once a week so that staff can assess for withdrawal symptoms and so you can meet with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_885588]. After you have been tapered off buprenorphine you will continue to come to the clinic once a week to meet with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_885587] [ADDRESS_1239038] your vital signs monitored at every visit. If during the course of treatment you resume taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (buprenorphine, heroin or other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) and are unable to give an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-free urine, you will be provided with referrals to alternative treatment programs. If you use opi[INVESTIGATOR_885589].   Approximately one tablespoon of blood will be drawn at the beginning and end of the study to check your liver enzymes. Additionally approximately six tablespoons blood, saliva and urine will be collected at the beginning and [ADDRESS_1239039] been infected with viral hepatitis (Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C). We are required by [CONTACT_885646].  If you are a woman, approximately one tablespoon of blood will be drawn to check for pregnancy before starting treatment. Also, since pregnant women may not participate in this research, women must practice an effective method of birth control until the end of the study. You will have a pregnancy urine test monthly.   If you suffer from depression or anxiety, you will have the opportunity to receive therapy to address those symptoms. You will also be seeing a psychiatrist who can evaluate your symptoms and may be offered the option of taking an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication.   End of Study At the end of Week [ADDRESS_1239040] transitioned into the follow-up treatment.   If you remain abstinent throughout the study, we strongly encourage you to continue treatment after study completion, and will work with you to help find another treatment provider. If you find difficult to remain

	4	abstinent (e.g., have strong cravings) we will offer you an additional month of medication (Vivitrol injection or 30-day supply of buprenorphine) and we will provide you with referrals for Vivitrol, buprenorphine, methadone, and behavioral treatment options. You should know that when you are provided with referrals, both injection and oral forms of naltrexone are available in the community, as well as forms of therapy similar to, as well as more intensive than, the behavioral therapy offered in this study. In the event that you decide to discontinue from the study, or are withdrawn from the study, you will be treated with buprenorphine until you have been transitioned to another buprenorphine treatment program or provider.   The doctors conducting this research study are also responsible for your clinical care. If during the course of the study, you have a medical emergency or require urgent medical care, the research medical staff will consult with your treating physician(s) regarding any information relevant to your medical care. In the event of an emergency or if you have questions while in the study, you can reach the clinic at ([PHONE_18327] during regular business hours.   V. Risks and Inconveniences   You are entering this study because you have been doing well on buprenorphine, but would like to stop taking it. A significant risk of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_885590]. Relapse is dangerous in several ways including risk of overdose. If you change your mind at any point and want to resume buprenorphine, you should let the study staff know and buprenorphine can be resumed. As you are reducing the medication, or once you have stopped the medication, if you begin to experience cravings or to use opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], it is important to seek help right away -i.e. let the study staff know right away, since medication like buprenorphine can be restarted and can protect you.   Another serious risk of study participation is that after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_885591] a lower dosage. This means that resuming use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885592], stop breathing and die. If you complete the detoxification and receive injectable naltrexone monthly, it will help protect you against death due to opi[INVESTIGATOR_885593]. However, if you stop taking naltrexone, restarting opi[INVESTIGATOR_885594]/or death.   Opi[INVESTIGATOR_885595] a moderately high risk of relapse and overdose if you use a significant amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885596]. We seek to minimize these risks by [CONTACT_885647][INVESTIGATOR_2441]. If you do relapse, you will be given referrals for methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, or inpatient detoxification and follow-up treatment. There may be a delay of up to [ADDRESS_1239041] been stabilized on naltrexone it generally has few side effects. However, it can cause irritation to the liver or may occasionally cause or contribute to depressive symptoms. Additional side effects may include difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], anxiety, nervousness, abdominal pain/cramps, nausea and/or vomiting, low energy, joint muscle pain, or headaches. It is important to note that these symptoms may represent persisting withdrawal symptoms, and the psychiatrist who is monitoring you can prescribe medications to reduce the discomfort.   If you take small amounts of heroin or other opi[INVESTIGATOR_885597], you should feel no opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-like effects. However, it is possible to overpower naltrexone if you take large amounts of heroin or other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Also, if you miss your Vivitrol injection, it is possible that you may be much more sensitive to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. This means that amounts of heroin or other opi[INVESTIGATOR_885598], stop breathing and die.  Naltrexone does not block the effects of other drugs such as cocaine, tranquilizers, or alcohol, and it does not reduce the risks when using these substances, such as getting drunk or high.  You should be aware that you may be more sensitive to the effects of heroin and other opi[INVESTIGATOR_885599], and therefore would be at a greater risk for overdose. This increased sensitivity to opi[INVESTIGATOR_885600]. Fentanyl and carfentanil are powerful synthetic opi[INVESTIGATOR_885601].   Naloxone Challenge Test  If you use opi[INVESTIGATOR_885602], you may be given a naloxone challenge test to determine whether or not you are dependent on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. We may administer up to 0.8 mg naloxone intramuscularly (by [CONTACT_17838]), which – if you have recently used opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] -can produce a number of withdrawal symptoms. You may experience symptoms such as: sweating, restlessness, stomach pain, diarrhea, headache, anxiety, nausea, vomiting dizziness, runny nose, yawning, muscle aches, or tremors. We will monitor your reactions to naloxone for up to 45 min.    Vivitrol  Risks of Vivitrol are possible irritation (e.g., redness, swelling, possible scarring) or infection at the injection site. Injection site reactions have ranged from a small, painless area of hardness to pain, itching, redness, and swelling. These reactions have typi[INVESTIGATOR_885603] a period of 1-[ADDRESS_1239042] also observed hives, an allergic reaction of the skin with redness and itching. If you develop any of these symptoms it is important to let us know.   If you miss your visit to receive Vivitrol, and/or take opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], you should come to the clinic immediately. There, you will be evaluated to determine if it is safe to restart the naltrexone. You may be asked to take an intramuscular injection of naloxone. If your body has become dependent on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], this dose will produce withdrawal symptoms lasting less than one hour. You may refuse the naloxone challenge but must be able to provide an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-negative urine or reconsider the challenge within 72 hours in order to determine whether you can safely restart naltrexone. If at this point, you are found to be dependent on opi[INVESTIGATOR_885604], you will be provided with referrals to alternative treatment programs.  It is very important that you tell your study physician about any other medications you are taking (either prescription or non-prescription) before beginning naltrexone. It is also very important that, during the course of the study, you tell your research psychiatrist about any other medications you are prescribed or plan to take to avoid possible adverse reactions.   Buprenorphine  When lowering daily doses of buprenorphine, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], anxiety, nervousness, abdominal pain/cramps, nausea and/or vomiting, low energy, joint muscle pain, headaches, or runny nose. You may also experience a rapid and sudden onset of withdrawal symptoms if you crush your take-home buprenorphine pi[INVESTIGATOR_885605]. These symptoms would be very uncomfortable but short-lived and not life threatening. If this occurs, your psychiatrist would evaluate you and provide you with referrals to alternative treatment.   Opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], like buprenorphine, can interact with medicines, such as antidepressants and migraine medicines, meant to increase the effects of serotonin, a chemical in the brain. This interaction causes a serious response in the brain called serotonin syndrome. If you are taking an opi[INVESTIGATOR_885606] a medicine that increases serotonin and develop symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations, rapid heart rate, fever, excessive sweating, shivering or shaking, muscle twitching or stiffness, trouble with coordination, and/or nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, you should seek medical attention immediately. These symptoms generally start within several hours to a few days of taking an opi[INVESTIGATOR_365858] a medicine that increases the effects of serotonin in the brain, but symptoms may occur later, especially after either medication is increased in dose.   Taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_491597] a rare, but serious condition where not enough of the hormone called cortisol is produced, particularly during stressful conditions when cortisol is usually produced. Consult your study doctor or seek medical attention (ensure that you communicate that you are participating in a clinical trial) if you experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, or low blood pressure. Long-term use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885607]. Inform your study doctor if you experience signs or symptoms of low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, lack of menstruation, or infertility.  Comfort Medications You will be given comfort medications to help manage your withdrawal during the detoxification. When you are taking the comfort medications (clonidine, clonazepam, prochlorperazine, and zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]), you should use caution when driving a vehicle or operating appliances or machinery. Only the most common risks of each comfort medication are highlighted below, so if you would like to learn more about the medications or their side effects, please ask your study doctor who can provide you with the Patient Information Sheets. These medications may cause some side effects such as sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], lowered blood pressure (which may produce

You will have a pregnancy test before beginning treatment and monthly thereafter to determine that you are not pregnant. You will be asked to use adequate birth control throughout your treatment such as: (a) any form of hormonal contraception such as Depo-Provera, daily oral contraceptive, transdermal patch or Nuva ring, (b) intra-uterine devices, (c) sterilization, or (d) double barrier contraception, which is a combination of any two of the following methods: condoms, spermicide, diaphragm.  The only risk to the blood-drawing procedures used in this study is the possibility that slight discomfort and/or a small bruise or, rarely, a local infection may develop at the site of the needle puncture. This seldom occurs. If taking any medication orally, it is being dispensed to you in packages that are not childproof. Extra precautions need to be taken to keep the oral medication away from children.   You will be carefully monitored throughout your participation to minimize the chance of any serious adverse side effects. We will provide you with any significant new findings that may develop during the course of the study, which may relate to your willingness to continue study participation. If you suspect that you might be pregnant, you must inform the study team immediately.   VI. Benefits   You may benefit directly from the treatment you receive with reduction in drug use and improvement in problems related to your drug use.

BUP DISCO Version 04.02.[ADDRESS_1239048] been successfully treated with buprenorphine and would like to stop taking buprenorphine. The main purpose of this research study is to evaluate two methods of buprenorphine discontinuation: a standard method of a graduated taper compared to a rapid discontinuation and transition onto Vivitrol.  This study is funded by a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).  Vivitrol is a long-acting injection that contains enough naltrexone to last up to one month; it is approved by [CONTACT_885641][INVESTIGATOR_2427]. It works by [CONTACT_885642][INVESTIGATOR_885582], but is not a controlled substance and has no opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-like effect itself. You are being asked to participate in this study because you are currently prescribed buprenorphine and meet other study entry criteria. If you are not eligible, you will be assisted in finding free or low-cost treatment services near your home. If you are eligible for the study, you will receive your current dose of buprenorphine for one month, and will be randomized to either a five-week gradual taper off buprenorphine, or a week long rapid taper followed by [CONTACT_885643]. You will receive individual therapy for [ADDRESS_1239049] your current or future treatment at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute or Columbia University Medical Center. You will be notified of significant new findings that may relate to your willingness to continue to participate.    III. Alternative Treatments/Alternatives to Participation   You do not need to participate in this research study to receive treatment for your opi[INVESTIGATOR_885583]. Other treatments are  available, including methadone maintenance, buprenorphine maintenance, inpatient or other outpatient detoxification programs, and "drug-free" treatments including outpatient counseling or residential or therapeutic community treatment.     

BUP DISCO Version 04.02.[ADDRESS_1239050] a cardiogram (a test to measure the electrical activity of your heart), blood tests, a physical exam, and a urine toxicology screen. After the initial screening visit(s), you will be told whether you may be eligible for this research treatment study. The screening process may take between a few days to a few weeks depending on the frequency of your visits. If you are not eligible, or if you are not interested in taking part in the research treatment, then the clinician will assist you in finding treatment for your problems elsewhere. If you are eligible for the study, you will come to the clinic once a week to receive your current dose of buprenorphine and for monitoring. At the end of this month you will be randomly assigned to one of two regimens of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_885584]: (Regimen 1) rapid discontinuation of buprenorphine followed by [CONTACT_885644] (Regimen 2) a gradual taper off of buprenorphine.   Regimen 1: Rapid Discontinuation + Vivitrol  You will begin your outpatient visits to the clinic at the beginning of the week, and you will be asked to come to the clinic daily ([ADDRESS_1239051] one hour each day) during this first week, in order to receive medications, naltrexone and other medications to reduce the discomfort of withdrawal from opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. At each outpatient visit, you will need to provide an observed urine sample, which will be tested for opi[INVESTIGATOR_885585].  You will have your blood pressure, heart rate, and rate of breathing checked by [CONTACT_20229].  The anti-withdrawal medication you will receive include: clonidine (a medicine used to treat high blood pressure), clonazepam (for anxiety), prochlorperazine (anti-nausea drug), and zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_401719] (for insomnia). If you experience significant withdrawal while at the clinic, you will be strongly encouraged to remain at the clinic for observation, and you may receive additional doses of medications.   If you are assigned to Regimen 1, you will be asked to stop taking buprenorphine and you will start taking medications to prevent withdrawal. Two days after the last dose of buprenorphine you will start taking naltrexone by [CONTACT_1966], first taking very low doses. If you do use buprenorphine or another opi[INVESTIGATOR_885586], you may receive a naloxone challenge to determine whether it is safe to continue with the rest of the dosing schedule.  At the end of the first week, you will receive an intramuscular injection of Vivitrol, a long-acting form of naltrexone that lasts in your system for 3-[ADDRESS_1239052] been evaluated for medical stability by [CONTACT_885645]/or psychiatrist. If you experience fatigue or 

BUP DISCO Version 04.02.[ADDRESS_1239053] injection.   Regimen 2: Gradual Taper  If you are assigned to Regimen 2, you will continue receiving buprenorphine on a weekly basis for five weeks, with the dose of buprenorphine gradually decreasing to minimize any possible withdrawal. At the end of the taper buprenorphine will be stopped.  During this time we ask that you come to the clinic once a week so that staff can assess for withdrawal symptoms and so you can meet with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_885588]. After you have been tapered off buprenorphine you will continue to come to the clinic once a week to meet with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_885587] [ADDRESS_1239054] your vital signs monitored at every visit. If during the course of treatment you resume taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (buprenorphine, heroin or other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) and are unable to give an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-free urine, you will be provided with referrals to alternative treatment programs. If you use opi[INVESTIGATOR_885589].   Approximately one tablespoon of blood will be drawn at the beginning and end of the study to check your liver enzymes. Additionally approximately six tablespoons blood, saliva and urine will be collected at the beginning and [ADDRESS_1239055] been infected with viral hepatitis (Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C). We are required by [CONTACT_885646].  If you are a woman, approximately one tablespoon of blood will be drawn to check for pregnancy before starting treatment. Also, since pregnant women may not participate in this research, women must practice an effective method of birth control until the end of the study. You will have a pregnancy urine test monthly.   If you suffer from depression or anxiety, you will have the opportunity to receive therapy to address those symptoms. You will also be seeing a psychiatrist who can evaluate your symptoms and may be offered the option of taking an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication.   End of Study At the end of Week [ADDRESS_1239056] transitioned into the follow-up treatment.

	4	If you remain abstinent throughout the study, we strongly encourage you to continue treatment after study completion, and will work with you to help find another treatment provider. If you find difficult to remain abstinent (e.g., have strong cravings) we will offer you an additional month of medication (Vivitrol injection or 30-day supply of buprenorphine) and we will provide you with referrals for Vivitrol, buprenorphine, methadone, and behavioral treatment options. You should know that when you are provided with referrals, both injection and oral forms of naltrexone are available in the community, as well as forms of therapy similar to, as well as more intensive than, the behavioral therapy offered in this study. In the event that you decide to discontinue from the study, or are withdrawn from the study, you will be treated with buprenorphine until you have been transitioned to another buprenorphine treatment program or provider.   The doctors conducting this research study are also responsible for your clinical care. If during the course of the study, you have a medical emergency or require urgent medical care, the research medical staff will consult with your treating physician(s) regarding any information relevant to your medical care. In the event of an emergency or if you have questions while in the study, you can reach the clinic at ([PHONE_18327] during regular business hours.   V. Risks and Inconveniences   You are entering this study because you have been doing well on buprenorphine, but would like to stop taking it. A significant risk of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_885590]. Relapse is dangerous in several ways including risk of overdose. If you change your mind at any point and want to resume buprenorphine, you should let the study staff know and buprenorphine can be resumed. As you are reducing the medication, or once you have stopped the medication, if you begin to experience cravings or to use opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], it is important to seek help right away -i.e. let the study staff know right away, since medication like buprenorphine can be restarted and can protect you.   Another serious risk of study participation is that after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_885591] a lower dosage. This means that resuming use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885592], stop breathing and die. If you complete the detoxification and receive injectable naltrexone monthly, it will help protect you against death due to opi[INVESTIGATOR_885593]. However, if you stop taking naltrexone, restarting opi[INVESTIGATOR_885594]/or death.   Opi[INVESTIGATOR_885595] a moderately high risk of relapse and overdose if you use a significant amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885596]. We seek to minimize these risks by [CONTACT_885647][INVESTIGATOR_2441]. If you do relapse, you will be given referrals for methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, or inpatient detoxification and follow-up treatment. There may be a delay of up to [ADDRESS_1239057] been stabilized on naltrexone it generally has few side effects. However, it can cause irritation to the liver or may occasionally cause or contribute to depressive symptoms.

You may experience symptoms such as: sweating, restlessness, stomach pain, diarrhea, headache, anxiety, nausea, vomiting dizziness, runny nose, yawning, muscle aches, or tremors. We will monitor your reactions to naloxone for up to 45 min.    Vivitrol  Risks of Vivitrol are possible irritation (e.g., redness, swelling, possible scarring) or infection at the injection site. Injection site reactions have ranged from a small, painless area of hardness to pain, itching, redness, and swelling.

With this Certificate, the investigators cannot be forced (for example, by [CONTACT_253181]) to disclose information that may identify you in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. Disclosure will be necessary, however, upon request of DHHS for the purpose of audit or evaluation. A Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member of your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research. Note however, that if an insurer, employer or other outside party, learns of your participation, and obtains your consent to receive research information, then the investigator may not use the Certificate of Confidentiality to withhold this information. This means that you and your family must also actively protect your own privacy. Finally, the Certificate does not prevent the researchers from reporting suspected or known neglect or sexual or physical abuse of a child, or threatened violence to self or others. Such information will be reported to the appropriate authorities.

[ADDRESS_1274131] organs to study human aging is the skin, 
due to its amenability to clinical inspection and serial biopsy. Recently, genome- wide 
analysis in an Ashkenazi population has provided the evidence that skin can age at different rates and that youthful appearing skin is associated with different gene variants 
(Chang et al.,  2014). The first studies to demonstrate anti -aging effects of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_907740] 1988 in which topi[INVESTIGATOR_907741]- aged skin  (Weiss et al., 1988) . Subsequently,  topi[INVESTIGATOR_907742] (vitamin A ) lotion was 
shown in a placebo- controlled study to decrease fine wrinkling in photo- protected skin in 
older individuals residing in nursing homes (Kafi et al ., 2007) .  
 Recent advances i n deep sequencing technology have  enabled the unbiased and 
detailed analysis of gene expression chang es in the skin  (Chang et al., 2013) . 
Furthermore, a type of deep sequencing technique called 3’ -end sequencing has 
demonstrated the ability to identify changes in a class of transcripts called long non-
coding RNAs (lnc RNAs) that are now understood to be a previously unrecognized way to 
regulate gene expression. Here, we propose to utilize this state- of –the-art technology to 
discover, in unbiased fashion, the rejuvenation effects of the most widely used class of topi[INVESTIGATOR_900] -aging agents, retinoids. In thi s study, we will focus on topi[INVESTIGATOR_907742], as it is an 
over-the-counter agent that has minimal side effects.  
Furthermore, studies on retinol to date in humans have occurred largely in white 
population even though individuals of Asian descent represent the majority of the world population. The potential effects of retinol on individuals of Asian descent are uncharacterized and represent an untapped potential to explore differences in aging across ethnic groups.  
While prior studies have indicated an increase in  glycosaminoglycans  (GAGs)  and 
collagen after topi[INVESTIGATOR_907743] (Kafi et al.,  2007), the true breadth of anti -aging effects 
including the mechanisms by [CONTACT_907753]. It is possible that topi[INVESTIGATOR_907744], such 
as NFkB related genes (Chang et al., 2013) as well as previously unknown aging 
pathways. This study aims to  discover the molecular basis of  rejuvenation effects of 
retinol so that new topi[INVESTIGATOR_907745]. We aim to do this in a Han Chinese cohort, as this is the most populous ethnic group among the East Asian population.  Given the similarity in haplotype 
of Han Chinese with Korean and Japanese populations, these latter groups will be included as well.

Spec ific Aim 1 : To discover  molecular  pathways of skin rejuvenation by [CONTACT_907754][INVESTIGATOR_26445] A  in East Asian  women  
 Specific Aim 2: To identify changes in wrinkling and biometrics associated with skin rejuvenation after topi[INVESTIGATOR_26445] A application  in East Asian  women  
 Specific Aim 3: To identify type and severity of adverse events associated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_907746].  by [CONTACT_106814] a 41% retinol solution in 55%  
polysorbate 20 in sufficient proportions with fragrance- free Norwegian Formula Neutrogena 
Body Moisturizer (Ortho- Neutrogena Co, Los Angeles, Calif ) to yield a 0.4% retinol lotion.  
The vehicle was similarly prepared with 55% polysorbate 20 solution in Norwegian Formula 
Neutrogena Body  Moisturizer. There were no discernable differences in color, odor,  
or consistency between the active lotion with retinol and the placebo lotion control. A stability 
study  using  high-performance liquid chromatography will be performed to demonstrate that 
more than 90% of 0.4% retinol remained in the moisturizer 3 months after preparation.  
Both 0.4% retinol lotion and its vehicle were placed  in dark glass containers covered with foil 
to eliminate transmission of UV radiation a nd stored at 4°C.

Enrollment  Visit  (VISIT 2 —subset of 30 participants from the older group above will be 
invited for this visit)  
Upon enrollment into the study, patients will be instructed on proper usage topi[INVESTIGATOR_907749].  The placebo versus treatment arm will be clearly labeled on the 
subject ’s diary to minimize subject error.  Participants will apply treatment to one arm and 
placebo to the other arm based on computer generated randomized assignment  of left or 
right for the retinol. Participants are blinded to the treatment . Participants will be given a diary 
to record adherence to study procedures . Participants will be instructed to discontinue study 
if there is  any itching or burning sensation that is moderate or severe and to contact [CONTACT_907755].  
 
Week 12  visit (VISIT 3 —the 30 participants from VISIT 2 (older group) only)  
Adverse events and concomitant medication changes will be assessed and recorded. Study diary will be reviewed for adherence to study regimen. Photographs, cutometry and TEWL 
measurements will be taken. Two 4 mm skin biopsies will be taken at this time, one  from the 
side with the retinol exposure and one from the side without retinol exposure after injection of 
a small amount of lidocaine anesthetic. Skin biopsies will be bisected and placed in either formalin for hematoxylin and eosin staining  and mucin staining (for GAG) , or placed into RNA 
later for subsequent gene expression analysis by 3’ -end sequencing as described in Chang 
et al.,  2013.  Tissue will also be sent for microRNA analysis.

of 10%, the sample size needed is [ADDRESS_1274134] 
for skin aging parameters including fine wrinkling  (tertiary  endpoint) , dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and 
surface texture with results graded on a [ADDRESS_1274135] deviations for the older patients before and after topi[INVESTIGATOR_26445] A treatment will be calculated 
and compared to placebo. We a nticipate there will be statistically significant differences in the 
mean scores in cutometry and TEWL measurements between treated and placebo groups.  
 Whole transcriptome libraries will be created from the samples stored in RNA later and sent for 3’ -end sequencing at Stanford Functional Genomics Core Facility  after de- identification . 
We have utilized this Core facility for other projects in the past with high quality results. 
Results will be analyzed by [CONTACT_907756] C hang ALS et 
al., 2013. Specifically, comparisons will be made in skin from older participants between the 
pre and post treatment compared to placebo. All results of interest from 3’ -end sequencing 
will be confirmed by [CONTACT_937] -qPCR.  
 
We anticipate that the adverse event rate (deemed related to study agent by [CONTACT_131558]) for 
participants is less than 10% and may include mild (grade 1) itching or burning.   Significance  
 This study will be  the first broad based, unbiased investigation into the molecular basi s of the 
anti-aging effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_26445] A . This study is a high qualit y, well- controlled study using 
state -of-the art technology  of 3-Seq and microRNA analysis. Our research group has 
established the workflow from previous larger studies  in skin agi ng (unpublished data) and 
can now leverage this experience for maximal efficiency and positive results. Specifically, we 
would be able to compare our results to inner arm skin from females younger than [ADDRESS_1274136] University School of Medicine

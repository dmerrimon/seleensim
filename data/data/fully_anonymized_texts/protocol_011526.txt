21 I) Introduction 
A) Aim/Hypothesis/Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of a 
sonic-activated, bulk fill composite , SonicFill ™ 2, by [CONTACT_671626] ™ 
Supreme  Ultra in the following categories1:  
Esthetic Properties  
• Surface luster 
• Staining – surface  
• Staining – margin  
• Color match and translucency  
• Esthetic anatomical form  
 
Functional Properties  
• Fracture of material and retention  
• Marginal adaptation  
• Aproximal anatomical form –  contact [CONTACT_2929]  
• Radiographic examination (when applicable)  
• Patient’s view  
Biological Properties  
• Postoperative ( hyper-)sensitivity and t ooth vitality  
• Recurrence of caries, erosion, abfraction  
• Tooth inte grity (enamel cracks, tooth fractures)  
• Adjacent mucosa  
 
The hypothesis to be tested is that t he sonic -activated, bulk fill composite, 
SonicFill ™ 2, will have comparable results to the traditional incremental 
technique composite, Filtek ™ Supreme Ultra, in overall clinical acceptability 
and in all compared categories  
 
II) Background and Rationale  
Marginal leakage appears to be an inherent shortcoming of all dental restorations. 
2-[ADDRESS_907388] filled 
with an increment, fewer contraction gaps at the margins can be expected.  Traditional, incrementally fille d dental composite material has been on the market 
for many years, and has been proven successful for use in posterior restorations.  
Traditional composite techniques require small amounts (up to 2mm) of composite 
be placed at a time and then light cured.  This process is pain staking and time 
consuming.  Newer products on the market are bulk fill – allowing increments of 
up to 5mm to be placed before light curing.  Many of these products then require 
a cappi[INVESTIGATOR_671611].  The newer SonicFill ™ 2 system is a

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_671610], DMD, MS, PhD  
Version 11/2/[ADDRESS_907389] composite following the 
incremental techni que with Filtek ™ Supreme Ultra (the resin composite used as a 
control in this study).  
 
III) Research Plan 
A) Experimental Design  
This study is a randomized, split-mouth, controlled, examiner- blinded clinical 
evaluation of Class II restorations using a new bulk-fill composite ( SonicFill ™ 
2) and comparing  it to 3M ESPE Filtek ™ Supreme Ultra resin composite placed 
in the traditional incremental technique.  
 
B) Sample Size and Statistical Analysis  
Sample size  
A sample size calculation was conducted using nQuery  Advisor (version 7.0).  
The calculation determined that with a sample size of n=35  subjects, all 95% 
confidence intervals will have a margin of error of no more than 16.6 %. Up to 
44 subjects will be treated to allow for 20% dropout.  Up to [ADDRESS_907390] 35 qualifying subjects complete the study . 
 
Statistical analysis  
Tables of descriptive statistics (counts and percentages for categorical 
variables, means and standard deviations for continuous variables) will be 
prepared to summarize the demographic characteristics of the patients, the 
distribution of restorations and baseline data, and to illustrate the recall and 
data analysis findings.   Because the hypothesis of the study does not involve 
superiority of one technique over another, and comparable results between SonicFill ™ 2 and Filtek ™ Supreme  Ultra are anticipated, confidence intervals 
will be used rather than p- values.   In particular, for each evaluation category, 
the percentage of times that SonicFill ™ 2 outperforms  Filtek ™ Supreme Ultra , 
the percentage of times that Filtek ™ Supreme  Ultra outperform  SonicFill ™ 2, 
and the percentage of times with equal performance will be calculated along with 95% confidence intervals.   Frequency distributions will also be calculated 
for each combination of technique and evaluation category, along with 95% 
confidence  intervals.   SPSS (Version 22) and R (Version 3.1.2) will be used in 
the analysis.  
 
Randomization  
A computerized randomization scheme will be developed to randomize which 
teeth will be in the study and which group  each tooth will be in.  The “sample 
function” in R version 3.1.[ADDRESS_907391]’s Case Report Form (CRF).

ability of a patient to complete the study.  
 
3) Subject Withdrawal/Termination Criteria  
− Subjects who do not comply with the study procedures, such as  
returning f or follow up visits may be withdrawn from the study.  
− Subjects who decide to stop participating in the study will be withdrawn.  
− Subjects who have a clin ical pulp exposure during restoration visit will 
be withdrawn from study and standard of care procedures for pulp 
exposure and restoration placement will be followed  and patient will be 
advised if they need further treatment and should be seen by a dentist  
outside the study (such as root canal therapy and/or crown).   
− Subjects who have external procedures or treatments performed on study teeth will be withdrawn from the study. However, if external treatment is only performed on one study tooth, the subject c an still 
participate in the study and the remaining, unaffected study tooth will 
still be monitored for research purposes.  
− Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_662910] (either withdrawn subjects  or subjects completing the study)  are in need of 
additional treatment and/or follow- up observation as a result of 
participation in this trial  (such as if a restoration fails) . Additional 
treatment may be needed for teeth that are not included in this stud y, 
but require a restoration.  Subjects and/or their insurance will be 
responsible for the cost of any standard of care follow- up visits or 
additional treatment that is not part of this study.  
 
 
E) Assessment  
1) Risk 
The patient may expect the usual post- operativ e pain or sensitivity that is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_671614],  (the risks for both groups is anticipated to be the same and 
are not greater than standard of care risks) , including: tooth pain, bite 
pain/sensitivity, gingival sensitivity/tenderness/redness, discomfort from 
the anesthetic , or allergic reaction to the anesthetic .  These events are 
expected to be localized and transient in nature .   
Another potential risk is partial loss, chippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or fracture of the restoration, trauma to restored or adjacent teeth, or total loss of the restoration.  
However, the rate of occurrence is anticipated to be very low (no higher 
than for other restorations).   
The risk of radiographs will be kept to a minimum using standard of care procedures (lead apron, digital radiographs, etc.). It is standard of care to 
have bitewing radiographs annually for caries detection. It is standard of care to have periapi[INVESTIGATOR_671615] I I restorations to ensure 
there are no signs of periapi[INVESTIGATOR_165645]. These risks are not beyond

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_671610], DMD, MS, PhD  
Version 11/2/[ADDRESS_907397] of care risks. At radiograph time, all female subjects will be 
questioned regarding pregnancy. Any responding positively at the time of 
screening will be excluded in accordance with the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. If a subject becomes pregnant during the course of the study, radiographs will be delayed until after delivery.  
 
There is the risk of loss of confidentiality to the subject by [CONTACT_114363] i n 
this study.  This risk will be kept to a minimum by [CONTACT_671629].  
 
2) Benefits  
There is no direct medical benefit to the subject for participation in this 
study .  
 
3) Alternatives  
Patients may choose not to participate in the study. A patient may choose 
to have the procedure completed at the TUSDM  or their private dentist at 
normal clinic fees .

G) Subject Safety  
1) Adverse Event Reporting  
 
Any adverse reactions to the treatment provided as part of the study will 
be fully investigated and recorded, including details of the appropriate clinical action taken, and reported to both the IRB and contact [CONTACT_671631].  
 
Adverse Events  
An adverse event  is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human subject, including any abnormal physical exam or laboratory 
finding, symptom, or disease, temporally associated with a subject’s participation in the research.   
 
Adverse events will be reco rded in source documents and on case report 
forms. All adverse events and non- serious situations will be recorded, 
monitored, and reported to the IRB at time of continuing review or at the 
study’s termination if this occurs before the  study’s next continui ng review.   
 
Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is one that results in death, or is life -threatening, 
or results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacitatio n, or results in a

21 congenital anomaly/birth defect, or may jeopardize the subject’s health and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed above.  
 Serious adverse events will be recorded in source documents and on case 
report forms. Serious Adverse Events  that meet the criteria of an 
unanticipated problem  will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days 
following the Reportable New Information Policy . Serious Adverse Event s 
not meeting the criteria for an unant icipated problem will be reported to 
the IRB at time of continuing review  or at the study’s termination if this 
occurs before the  study’s next continuing review.  
 Unanticipated Problems  
An unanticipated problem is an incident, experience, or outcome that meets 
all of the following criteria: 1) The nature, severity, or frequency is 
unexpected for the subject population or research activities as described in 
the current IRB approved protocol, supporting documents, and the ICF(s); 
2) it is related or possibly  related to participation in the research; 3) it 
suggests the  research may place the subject or others at a greater risk of 
harm then was previously recognized.  
 Unanticipated problems will be recorded in source documents and on case 
report forms. Unantici pated problems will be reported to the IRB within 5 
business days after the PI/study team becomes aware of the problem. A 
Reportable  New Information Form will be submitted to the IRB no later than 
5 business days after the PI/study team becomes aware of the problem.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADEs)  
Unanticipated adverse device effect means any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
UADEs will be documented in source documents and on case report forms 
as to onset, severity, duration, management, outcome and relatedness to the test device. UADEs will be reported to the IRB within  [ADDRESS_907403].

1) Screening  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -Is will conduct screening examinations to identify subjects 
who meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria for enrollment into the s tudy. 
 
2) Informed Consent  
[CONTACT_671642] and/or his representative  will introduce the study.   
 
Consenting will take place in a private clinic bay area and the patient will 
be given as much time as he/she needs to consider participation. The 
participant will be invited to include or exclude any associates (e.g., loved ones) in the consent process.  
 Patients will be asked to read the consent form and given ample opportunity 
to have their questions answered.  To avoid coercion, the consenting 
investigator will read through the copy of the consent form with the 
participant section by [CONTACT_68979], making sure the participant understands 
each section and has an opportunity to ask questions.  If at any time the 
participant indicates s/he is not interested in participation, the meeting will 
end.   
 
If after going through the consent form, the participant indicates s/he would 
like to discuss the study with associates or think about participating, then the meeting will be ended and the participant will be asked to contact [CONTACT_671632] s/he makes her decision. If the participant contacts the study 
in the future fo r participation, s/he will be invited back to the clinic, and if 
informed consent is given at that time, study activities will begin then.  
 If the participant indicates s/he may be interested in participating after 
going through the consent form with the i nvestigator, and the investigator 
determines the participant has the capacity to provide informed consent, the participant will be asked to provide informed consent at that time. 
Patients will certify their willingness to participate in the study by [CONTACT_666842].  The subject will 
be given a copy of the consent form.    
 
If any new finding requires any change to the informed consent form, the 
subject will be re -consented.  
 
Non-English speaking subjects will not be enrolled in the study because 
study staff at this time are not certified, prepared, or trained to translate 
or communicate in any language other than English. The study budget does 
not allow for the payment of translation services at this time.  There are no 
direct benefits to this population by [CONTACT_4907] .

21 (d) Provision for Care in Case of Accident or Injury  
In the unlikely event that a study patient becomes ill or is injured as a 
result of  participating in this study and medical care is necessary, such 
medical care will be provided by a physician chosen by [CONTACT_102]. In 
the event of a research- related injury, compensation will be determined 
on a case -by-case basis by [CONTACT_671634] T ufts University . 
 
7) Study Results  
If interested, study results will be presented to a subject upon their 
request, either in person or via mail according to their preference , upon 
completion of the study . A log will be kept of the participants who are 
interes ted in rece iving study results.  
 
8) Confidentiality  
To ensure confidentiality of subject information, each subject enrolled in 
the study will be assigned a unique alphanumeric code. Subjects’ files and 
all study paperwork will be kept in a secure, locked cabi net in a secure room 
when the documentation is not being reviewed. The information will only 
be shared between the researchers. Source documents and case report forms will be coded and free of subject names . Photographs will be taken 
of subject’s teeth only  (no facials). All HIPAA requirements will be followed. 
All electronic files will be kept on a password protected computer in a 
secure, locked office.  
 
(a) Coding  
Each will be assigned a subject identification number.  Alphanumeric 
identification numbers will be assigned sequentially. The full subject 
identification number will consist of the three letters from the subject’s 
initials and their enrollment number.  This will be accessible by [CONTACT_671635].  
 
(b) Access  
Only study personnel will have access to data.  Investigators will permit monitoring, audits, and regulatory inspections and will provide direct access to study related documentation.  
 
9) Data Safety Monitoring Plan:  
The study will be monitored at appropriate intervals by a trained member of the Kavo Kerr R&D clinical Research group (or qualified designee) by [CONTACT_671636], study data, 
and study photographs. Study monito ring visits will involve review of the 
study status and any issues related to the study. All Informed Consent forms will be reviewed for signatures and dates. Patient charts/records will 
be reviewed to ensure that all enrolled subjects meet the study inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. All CRFs will be reviewed for completeness of data 
entry to ensure that the study protocol is being followed, and to perform 
source data verification against information contained in the patient charts.

Version 11/2/2018                    Page 16 of 
21 Materials will be checke d for adequate storage and sufficient quantity to 
meet the study needs.  
 
Study personnel will monitor this trial for all safety related issues to 
determine whether an unreasonable risk to subjects develops. Quality 
control measures include routine inspecti on of case report forms, source 
documents, data tabulations, and tracking of adverse events . 
 Complaints 
 
Complaint means any written, electronic or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, saf ety, 
effectiveness, or performance of a device. Complaints will be reported in source documents and on case report forms . 
  
10) New Findings  
The subject will be informed of any significant new findings discovered 
during the course of this study that might infl uence the subject’s 
continuation and participation in the study.  Subjects will be told at a study 
appointment or via telephone of new findings during the study.   
 Cost of treatment for any new findings will not be covered by [CONTACT_1758].  
 If new findings r equire revisions to the ICF, the subject  will be re -
consented.  
 
11) Policy Regarding Replacement of Restorations  
 
All subjects will be pre -screened by [CONTACT_671637].  Participants will be 
advised of any dental pathology diagnosed (periapi[INVESTIGATOR_671621], caries, periodontal problems, etc) at that time and advised of the specific 
treatment(s) needed (root canal treatme nt, restoration, core build- up, 
periodontal therapy, etc).  If any pathology is found, each individual must 
arrange to have the pathology treated at their own expense.  A second 
examination will be scheduled to assess that treatment before these candidates  are considered for inclusion in this study.  
 
If conditions arise in which the subject requires endodontic treatment after 
the restoration is placed and is within the study duration (two years), the 
subject will be responsible for any root canal and/or po st and core 
treatment.  However, Kavo Ker Group will reimburse the School of Dental 
Medicine for the cost of the restoration (up to $175 per unit depending on the type of the restoration) which will be credited to the subject towards 
the cost of his/her new restoration.   In order to receive this level of 
Clinical Evaluation of Kerr SonicFill™ 2 vs 3M ESPE Filtek™ Supreme  Ultra Universal Restorative  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_671610], DMD, MS, PhD  
Version 11/2/[ADDRESS_907408] not associated with 
the study, will be selected by [CONTACT_671638].  That individual will evaluate the cause of failure and determine 
the need for a new restoratio n.  The study sponsor or the School of Dental 
Medicine at Tufts University will not be held responsible for any re -
treatment when trauma or injury are determined to be the cause of failure 
and said failure is unrelated to participation in the study.    
 
I) Record Retention  
1) Study Records  
The Investigator will maintain all study records and documents during 
the study period .  All paper files and documents will be kept in a locked 
file cabinet, within a locked room.  Electronic records will be kept on a 
password protected computer and only be accessible to study personnel.  
  
2) Long Term Retention  
The investigator will maintain all study records following completion or termination of this study in accordance to state law and institutional policy  
(at least 7 years  after the study is completed or terminated) . 
 
K) Reporting  
 Progress reports on the investigation shall be submitted to the sponsor and 
the IRB at regular intervals, but in no event less often than yearly. Progress 
reports to the sponsor should follow baseline, [ADDRESS_907409] and presentation of final 
report Unanticipated problems and adverse events will  be reported per the Tufts 
MC/TUHS IRB Reportable New Information Policy.  
 
The IRB will be notified of any deviations from the protocol in cases of medical 
emergencies when the change is necessary to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to the subject  
Progress reports on the investigation shall be submitted to the IRB at regul ar 
intervals, but in no event less often than yearly, e.g., at continuing review.  
 
 
L) Protocol Deviations  
Clinical Evaluation of Kerr SonicFill™ 2 vs 3M ESPE Filtek™ Supreme  Ultra Universal Restorative  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_671610], DMD, MS, PhD  
Version 11/2/[ADDRESS_907410] to IRB approval  and with sponsor agreement.  All 
such changes or deviations will be reported to the IRB as they occur and 
included in the final study report.  
M) Study Termination  
This study may be terminated for the following reasons:  
Discovery of unforeseen risk that could jeopardize the dental/physical 
well-being of subjects.  
Enrollment or recall rates that are not likely to produce sufficient data for evaluation of safety and efficacy  
Non-compliance with the clinical investigational plan, the Investigator  
Agreement, applicable FDA regulations or conditions of approval imposed by [CONTACT_671639]/contracts between the 
sponsor and the institution.  
In the event of study termination, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_662916]/or follow- up 
observation as a result of participation in this trial.  
 
N) Subject Recruitment/Advertising  
Investigators may also inform clinic patients about the study.   
Investigators may send messages to colleagues via axiUm asking for their help in recruiting eligible subjects.  
Likewise, e -mails and/or newsletters that alert the TUSDM community to 
ongoing studies may include information on this study  for recruiting purposes.  
Forms of electronic media such as twitter, university website s, Facebook , 
Craiglist,  etc. may also be used to recruit. Print media such as the Metro may 
also be used.  
Study personnel may reach out to individuals that have previously expressed 
interest in dental research studies using a phone screening script.  
All of the forms of recruitment will be submitted for IRB approval prior to use.   
A screening interview/questionnaire or screening script will be used for 
recruitment.  
Screen failure d ata will be retained by [CONTACT_976]. Screening ID number and 
demographic information will be recorded.  Identifiable information will not be 
recorded in the screening log.

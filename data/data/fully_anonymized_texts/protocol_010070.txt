 3. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE  
Carp al tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral neuropathy, affecting 
approximately 5% of the population 1.  A multitude of treatments are available to  treat CTS, 
including activity modification, bracing/splinting, hand therapy, modalities (e.g., therapeutic 
lasers or ultrasound, iontophoresis), ac upuncture, corticosteroid injections, and carpal tunnel 
release ( CTR ) surgery  performed  using an open or an endoscopic approach 2-7.  Currently, there 
is no universally accepted algorithm to guide treatment for pat ients suffering with CTS.  T he 
American Academy of Orthopedic Surgery (AAOS)  CTS Clinical Practice Guidelines reported 
that only three treatments are strongly supported in the literature: splinting, corticosteroid injections, and CTR  
4.  Although some patients with mild -moderate symptoms are successfully 
treated with splinting and/or corticosteroid injections, those with progressive, refractory, or 
severe symptoms generally proceed to CTR for definitive management  2,3,5 -9. 
 
The goal of CTR is to reduce median nerve pressure by  [CONTACT_740318]  
(TCL)  while avoiding iatrogenic injury to surrounding neurovascular structures.  Among the 
~600,[ADDRESS_1011932]  (70-80%) use  a 
traditional open technique  (OCTR)  during which a palmar incision is made to dissect down to 
the TCL and transect it using a scalpel, scissors, o r a similar cutting device  11-13.  The OCTR 
technique require s a relatively large (3 -5 cm) incision and may be  associated with a prolonged 
recovery period due to palmar pain and the need to protect the wound 12,14 -17.   
 
Over time, there has been a trend to use smaller incisions (1- 3 cm) to reduce surgical morbidity 
using mini -OCTR (mOCTR)  or endoscopic CTR  11,16,[ADDRESS_1011933] demonstrated the feasibility of using ultrasound to perform 
CTR through even  smaller incisions while maintaining or even improving visualization of the 
carpal tunnel region, including its at -risk neurovascular structures.  During CTR with  ultrasound 
guidance  (CTR -US), the carpal tunnel is typi[INVESTIGATOR_740314] a single small wrist or 
palmar incision  <[ADDRESS_1011934] -treatment  compar ing recovery time, effectiveness, and safety in 
subjects with CTS treated with CTR -US or mOCTR with US guidance  
19-31.  Among these over 
1300 hands , there were no major neurovascular complications, and the clinical success rate was 
>95%.  Furthermore, two  randomized controlled trials and  one prospective non-randomized trial 
demonstrated superior early outcomes for CTR -US compared to mOCTR 21,24,28.  However, these 
trials were limited by [CONTACT_133206], short follow -up duration, or both.  No randomized 
controlled trial comparing CTR -US to mOCTR ha s been performed with a samp le size over [ADDRESS_1011935] 1 year of follow -up.  Thus, the objective of this randomized controlled 
trial is to compare the safety and effectiveness of CTR -US vs. mOCTR in a large cohort of 
patients (n=120) with symptomatic CTS followed for  1-year post -treatment.

 4. DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The UltraGuideCTR (Sonex Health, Inc., Eagan, MN) is a commercially available medical 
device specifically developed to facilitate C TR-US.  The device is a single -use, hand- held device 
that is inserted into the ca rpal tunnel through a small (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] < 5 mm) wrist incision using 
continuous US guidance.  The working tip of the UltraGuideCTR consists of two inflatable balloons that border a centrally located, retractable retrograde cutting knife. When inflated with sterile saline , the balloons increase the diameter of the tip from [ADDRESS_1011936] perfor med over 15,000 procedures.  Labeled images of the device are provided 
below.

effectiveness information on the device  and patient outcomes . The research methods adhered to 
the guidelines set forth in the  Declaration of Helsinki.   This study was granted a waiver of 
consent exemption from WCG IRB (Puyallup, WA) . 
 
The eligibility criteria were purposely  broad to reflect a heterogenous sample of CTS patients  
treated in routine clinical practice.   Patient diagnosis was determined  according to the practice 
patterns of each participating physician, all of whom were experienced in the diagnosis and management of CTS. CTS  was diagnosed primarily on clinical  grounds, with ancillary testing 
such as electrophysiological studies ordered a t the discretion of the physician. Eligible patients 
were adults (age ≥18 years) who were treated with CTR -US and demonstrated a willingness to 
participate in the registry and participate in specified follow -up activities.   No limitations were 
imposed on m aximum patient age, medical or surgical history, or clinical presentation.  
 
All patients were treated with CTR -US using the UltraGuideCTR  device, which was inserted 
into the car pal tunnel through a small (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] <5 mm) wrist incision using real- time ultrasound 
guidance.  The physicians in this study represented a variety of specialties and procedur al 
experience and  completed a formal cadaver -based training program prior to per forming CTR -US 
in clinical practice.   Factors such as patient  selection, anesth esia, and postoperative care were 
determined by [CONTACT_14603] -specific preferences.  Face -to-face follow -up visits  varied according to 
the usual practice patterns of each participati ng physician and were not dictated by [CONTACT_1758]. 
There was no requirement for r eturn follow -up visits as all data were  collected via text message, 
e-mail,  or chart review.  
 Patients completed a preoperative questionnaire, daily post -operative text message questions for 
up to [ADDRESS_1011938]  procedure, and emailed questionnaires at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 
months postoperatively. Pre -treatment  patient assessments included demographic data, medical 
and surgical history, work status, and patient -reported  outcomes including the Quick form of the 
Disabilities o f the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire (QDASH), and the  BCTQ -SSS and 
Functional Status Scale (BCTQ -FSS). Return to normal  activities and return to work were 
collected via daily text messages for the first 14 days. Thereafter, postoperative outcomes we re 
collected via e -mail or text message and included QDASH, BCTQ -SSS, BCTQ -FSS, return to 
normal activities,  return to work, and patient satisfaction. 
 Co-primary endpoints of this study were QDASH, B CTQ -SSS,  and BCTQ -FSS. The QDASH is 
an 11- item patient- reported  questionnaire that has been validated for CTS where the  total score 
ranges from 0 (indicating no disability) to 100 (indicating most severe disability) 
32. The BCTQ 
is a CTS  specific questionnaire consisting of 11 symptom severity questions and 8 functional 
status questions. Scoring for the BCTQ - SSS and BCTQ -FSS ranges from 1 to 5, wit h higher 
scores  indicating more severe symptoms 33.  Minimal clinically  important differences (MCIDs) 
for the postoperative change  in patient -reported outcomes were 15 points  for QDASH 34, 1.14

 points for BCTQ -SSS 35, and 0.74 points for BCTQ -FSS 35.  Return to normal activi ties was 
ascertained  by [CONTACT_740319].  
Return to work was ascertained by [CONTACT_740320], a definition that is commonly used among CTS studies 36,37.  Patient satisfaction 
with the procedure was  reported on a 5 -point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very diss atisfied)  to 5 
(very satisfied); a score of 4 or 5 indicated that  a patient was satisfied with the procedu re.  
Postoperative complications were recorded via chart review  performed by [CONTACT_1963].  
 Among 535 patients who enrolled in the registry and provided postoperative follow -up, data 
were available on 499 (93%) patients at 2 weeks, 475 (89%) at 1 month, 446 (83%) at 3 months, and 373 (70%) at 6 months.  The cohort of 373 patients with 6- month follow -up form the basis 
for this report.  Between November 2019 and July 2021, 373 patients (427 hands, mean age 55 
years, 71% female, 62% employed) underw ent CTR -US at 24 sites in the [LOCATION_002] .  A total 
of 329 (88.2%) procedures were performed using local anesthesia, 44 (11.8%) were perform ed 
using monitored anesthesia care, and no procedures were performed using general anesthesia.  There were 217 uni lateral CTR -US procedures, 51 bilateral staged CTR -US procedures, and 54 
bilateral simultaneous CTR -US procedures.  Bilateral simultaneous procedures consisted of 
14.5% of cases and 25.3% of treated hands.   
 
Patient -reported measures of symptom severity a nd physical function demonstrated rapid 
improvement following CTR -US.  Mean QDASH scores were 41.7±20.1 at baseline, 21.4±15.9 
at 2 weeks, 17.7±15.1 at 1 month, 13.3±15.0 at 3 months, and 11.0±15.2 at 6 months.  QDASH scores decreased by 20.3 (95% CI: 17.5 to 23.0) points at 2 weeks and 30.8 (95% CI: 28.1 to 
33.4) points at 6 months (p<0.001 at each follow -up interval).   
 
Mean BCTQ -SSS scores w ere 3.0±0.7 at baseline, 1.7±0.6 at 2 weeks, 1.7±0.6 at 1 month, 
1.5±0.6 at 3 months, and 1.4±0.6 at 6 months.  BC TQ-SSS scores decreased by 1.3 (95% CI: 
1.2-1.4) points at 2 weeks and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.5- 1.7) points at 6 months (p<0.001 at each follow -
up int erval).  Mean BCTQ -FSS scores were 2.4±0.8 at baseline, 1.7±0.6 at 2 weeks, 1.6±0.5 at 1 
month, 1.4±0.5 at 3 months, and 1.3±0.5 at 6 months.  BCTQ -FSS scores decreased by 0.7 (95% 
CI: 0.5- 0.8) points and 1.0 (95% CI: 0.9- 1.1) points at 2 weeks and 6 month s, respectively 
(p<0.001 at each follow -up interval).  
 
The median time to return to normal activities following C TR-US was 3 days ( interquartile range  
[IQR]: 2-5 days), with 96.5% of patients reporting return to normal activities within 2 weeks of 
the procedure.  Among employed patients, the median time to return to work following CTR -US 
was 5 days (IQR: 3- 9 days), w ith 92.3% of patients reporting return to work within 2 weeks of 
the procedure.  The median time to return to work based on employment type was 4 days (IQR: 
3-6 days) for desk- based occupations, 6 days (IQR: 4- 11 days) for light manual occupations, and 
5 days (IQR: 3 -14 days) for heavy manual occupations.  The percentage of patients who were 
satisfied or very satisfied with the procedure was 91.6% at 2 w eeks, 88.2% at 1 month, 88.0% at 
3 months, and 89.8% at 6 months.   
 
Among 346 (93%) patients with availa ble complication data, no major neurovascular 
complications were reported.  Specifically, there was 1 (0.3%) incomplete release confirmed during reoper ation and no reports of superficial infection, deep infection, arterial laceration, or 
permanent nerve injury.

6.2.3 Screen Failures  
Participants who are consented to participate in the clinical trial, but who do not meet one or more criteria required for participation in the trial during the screening procedures, are considered screen failures.  Screen failures will be immediately discontinued from the trial and will not be randomized to receive CTR -US or mOCTR.   Participants who are discontinued from 
the study due to screen failure may not be reconsidered for study enrollment at a later date.  Study sites will document screen failures by [CONTACT_740321], an anonymized patient iden tifier, and the primary inclusion and/or exclusion criterion failure that resu lted in the 
decision to discontinue the patient from the study.

 sequence will be stratified by [CONTACT_740322].  Treatment assignment will be 
concealed until it is presented to authorized site personnel at the time of randomization.  Only 
randomized and treated subjects will be considered enrolled in the study.  Randomized patients who do not receive their assigned  treatment will be discontinued from the trial.  
 
6.4 BLINDING  
Owing to obvious differences in surgical technique, it is not possible to blind the treating 
physicians.  Owing to notable visual differences in the postoperative scar between surgical techniques (3- 5 mm for CTR -US and approximately 3 cm for mOCTR), it is not possible to blind 
the subjects.  Owing to the fact that all data collected in this trial will be self -reported, it is not 
possible to blind outcome assessors (i.e., subjects).

 8. ADVERSE EVENTS  
An AE  is de fined as any adverse change (i.e., de novo  or preexisting condition) from the 
subject’s baseline medical condition occurring after the  initial procedural  incision has been 
initiated.   Any AE which resolved and then recurred w ill be reported as a separate AE.   A pre -
specified listing of AEs will be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
 
8.1 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as one that suggests a significant hazard or side effect, 
regardless of the relationship to the devic e or procedure .  This includes, but may not be limited 
to, any event that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred  
• Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
• Is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant hazards  
 Important medical events may be considered serious by [CONTACT_740325][INVESTIGATOR_059].  Such important medical events are those that may jeopardize the subject, require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or result in urgent inve stigation.   
  SAEs  should be reported to the study Sponsor as soon as possible (24 hours recommended), but 
no more than [ADDRESS_1011955] (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on the health or 
safety  of a subject , any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a  device, 
if such  effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan (e.g., ICF, Study Protocol, Instructions for Use (IFU), publications, etc.), or any other unanticipated serio us problem associated with a device that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects . 
 If an unanticipated adverse effect associated with the device occurs, the investigator shall notify the Sponsor  and the IRB as soon as possible.   
 The Sponsor  will investigate the event and notify the FDA and all other participating IRBs and 
investigators.  Should the Sponsor  determine that an unanticipated adverse effect presents an

No. 9007 9-TP, Rev.0 5 
 unreasonable risk to all participating subjects, the Sponsor will suspend the cl inical investigation 
and notify all partici pating investigators, IRBs , country regulatory bodies and FDA.  
 
8.3 RELATION SHIP OF ADVERSE EVENTS TO THE DEVICE OR PROCEDURE  
A description of how an AE relates to the study device or  procedure will be reported on th e 
Adverse Event CRF . 
 
• A device- related AE is directly attributable to the device or to improper use of the device.   
• A procedure -related AE is directly attributable to the procedure, irrespective of the device, 
including complications from anesthesia or other procedures incidental to the main 
procedure.  
 
The relationship of the AE to the device or procedure will be  determined by [CONTACT_22281]:  
 
• Definite :  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from t he time of the  index 
procedure, which includes AEs that occur during the index procedure or during the follow -up period.  
• Probable :  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of the index 
procedure, and the possibility can be excluded that factors other  than the index procedure, 
such as underlying disease, concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatment caused the AE.  
• Possible :  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of the index procedure 
and the possibility of  index procedure involvemen t cannot be excluded.  However, other factors 
such as underlying disease, concomitant medications, or concurrent treatment are presumable.  
• Unlikely :  The AE has an improbable temporal sequence from the time of the index 
procedure , or such AE can be reasona bly explained by [CONTACT_1604], including 
underlying disease, concomitant medication, or concurrent treatment.  
• Not related : The AE has no temporal sequence from the time of the index procedure, or it 
can be explained by [CONTACT_134340], including underlying disease, concomitant medication, 
or concurrent treatment.  
 
8.4 DEVICE FAILURES, MALFUNCTIONS AND NEAR INCIDENTS  
Device failures or malfunctions will be reported to Sonex Health  by [CONTACT_145889].  If the 
failure or malfunction re sults in an AE , the event s hall be reported to the Sponsor within two ( 2) 
working days  after the Investigator becomes aware of the event  and reported to the IRB (if 
required) within the IRB  required timeframe.  The device involved in the incident should be  
returned to the Sponsor fo r evaluation.   
 8.5 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
AEs will be recorded on the Adverse Event  CRF and described by (a) duration ( onset  and 
resolution dates); (b) relationship to the study device or procedure; (c) action taken to resolve  the 
event; (d) outcome of the event; and (e) whether or not such event is considered to have been

Determination of whether a subject experienced  an AE can be made in  three different ways .  
First, an AE can be documented  by [CONTACT_740326].  Second, a subject m ay 
report an AE directly via phone call to the i nvestigative site.  Third, an AE can be identified by 
[CONTACT_740327] -uploaded wound healing images . If the site identifies a 
potential AE based on image review or is notified of a potential AE by [CONTACT_423], confirmation of the AE will occur by a phone call with the subject or, if necessary, by [CONTACT_740328] a follow -up clinical evaluation.   
 
8.[ADDRESS_1011957] (DSMB) will oversee  enrollment and safety of the subjects for  
the study.  Members of DSM B will be independent of the sponsor  and investigational sites .  The 
DSMB for the study will consist of three  (3) clinicians with expertise  in orthopedic or plastic 
surgery , and with experience and expertise in clinical trials.   The DSMB will convene at least 
once during the subject enrollment period and will review, at a minimum, subject enrollment 
status and incidence of AEs.  Based on a review of these data, t he DSMB  will advise the Sponsor 
to continue the trial  with no modification, or to modify the tri al as appropriate if enrollment or 
safety concerns are identified.

 10. DATA ANALYSIS  
This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial d esigned to evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of CTR -US compared to mOCTR in treating subjects with symptomatic CTS.  
Eligible subjects will be randomized (2:1) to receive CTR- US (n≈80) or mOCTR (n ≈40). 
 
10.1 SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION  
The results of the power analysis provided a sample size consisting of 10 2 evaluable subjects.   
Group sample sizes of 68 and 34 achieve 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of zero effect 
size when the population effect size is 0.[ADDRESS_1011959] with a 2:[ADDRESS_1011960] 
attrition, 120 subjects (n≈ 80 CTR-US, n≈ 40 mOCTR) will be enrolled  in the trial.  
 10.[ADDRESS_1011961] receives CTR- US or mOCTR.  Postoperative study day will be 
calculated relative to day 0 as follows:  
 
Study Day = (Date of Event – Date of Treatment)  
 
10.4 ANALYSIS WINDOWS  
Study data will be categorized into discrete, contiguous reporting windows to ensure that all 
available data are in cluded in the analyses.  The analysis windows for this study are defined 
below:

For categorical variables, percentages will be calculated based on non -missing data.  
 
The percentage of patients in each treatment group that return to normal daily activities within 3 
days postoperatively, and the percentage of  employed patients in each treatment group that return 
to work within 3 days postoperatively will be reported and compared using the Fisher’s exact test.  
These outcomes will  also be reported as the median and interquartile range in each treatment 
group.  Due to the likelihood that the data distribution may be positively skewed, the 
nonparametric Mann -Whitney U test will be the statistical test used to assess  these endpoints.   
 Differences between the CTR -US and mOCTR groups with respect to longitudinally measured 
continuous outcomes (i.e. BCTQ -SSS, BCTQ -FSS, Numeric Pain Scale, EQ-5D- 5L) will be 
analyzed using mixed model analysis and adjusting for the basel ine score.   
 Adverse events will be reported using counts, percentages and exact 95% confidence intervals using Clopper- Pearson’s method.  The incidence of AEs in each group will be calculated on a 
per-subject basis and analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. 
 Statistical analyses will be performed using a two -sided hypothesis test at a 5% level of 
significance.  No adjustments for multiplicity are planned .  Missing data imputation will not be 
performed.

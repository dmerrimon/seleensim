Individualizing Treatment for Asthma in Primary Care 
1) OBJECTIVES
Feasibility Aims: 
Specific Aim 1: Establish the final protocol for the study, in conjunction with all stakeholder groups, 
including recruitment, implementation support, safety reviews, data collection/adjudication and 
IRB approval. 
Specific Aim 2: Recruit up to 125 eligible individuals into a four-month “Vanguard” pi[INVESTIGATOR_433460], across 5 participating sites, with qualitative feedback from 
participants, clinicians, staff, and research teams. Recruit up to 65 individuals at the remaining 
five sites to complete the active symptom monitoring activities for 4 to 6 weeks each, with 
qualitative feedback from up to 25 participants and up to 20 clinicians and staff. 
Specific Aim 3:  Adjust protocol based on the findings of specific aim [ADDRESS_549318]. 
Full Study Aims: 
Specific Aim 1: Implement and evaluate 3 interventions, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of 
rescue therapy (Rescue ICS or R-ICS pronounced “RICKS”), prolonged azithromycin usage, and the 
combination of the two, compared to control individuals using Asthma Symptom Monitoring 
(ASM), in a patient-level randomized trial, among people with different asthma phenotypes, with 
annualized asthma exacerbation rate as the primary outcome. 
Specific Aim 2: Analyze the impact on secondary outcomes of asthma control, asthma quality of life, 
and missed days of school or work across the 3 effector arms, and multiple asthma phenotypes, 
compared to control participants as well as head-to-head comparisons between arms.
Specific Aim 3: Using the PRISM (updated RE-AIM) framework evaluate the 3 different interventions 
for overall use with “eligible individuals,” willingness of practices to engage with the 
interventions, fidelity of implementation by [CONTACT_433525], and maintenance of the 
interventions by [CONTACT_433526]. 
2) BACKGROUND
Impact of Asthma. Twenty-five million people have asthma in the US.1 [See Appendix [ADDRESS_549319].] Asthma exacerbations (AEX) cause the largest number of lost days from school or work for 
children and young adults, 1/[ADDRESS_549320] 20 years, from 51.6% to 46%.15, [ADDRESS_549321] 
fallen by a 1/[ADDRESS_549322] 15 years, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_52857] 15 per million people with asthma to 10 per million; 
but asthma still accounts for over 3,[ADDRESS_549323] 2 times 
the rate of exacerbations and 1.5 times the rate of death.19, 20 Thus, there is an ongoing need to 
expand and improve treatment approaches for individuals with asthma. 
While asthma therapy is becoming more individualized based on asthma phenotypes,12-14, 21-
23 other than eosinophil counts for biologics, we know little about how to tailor newer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_433461]. Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medications are the foundation of care for all individuals 
with persistent asthma.24 But ICS use is not without possible long term side effects, i.e., increased 
bone loss in pre-menopausal women,25 transient growth retardation in children,26 increased risk of 
carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in children,27, 28 and pneumonia and adrenal suppression at 
higher doses.29-33

Page 3 of 113Treatment Options to be Studied: 
We will compare two currently available approaches to reduce AEX in primary care patients: (1) use 
of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of rescue therapy, also known as SMART therapy (Single 
Maintenance And Reliever Therapy) or PARTICS therapy (Patient Activated Reliever Trigger Inhaled 
Corticosteriods) combined referred to as R-ICS, and (2) use of azithromycin (AZ) as a preventive 
therapy, both individually and in combination.  
Evidence for ICS as part of Reliever Therapy 
Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay for treatment of persistent asthma.[ADDRESS_549324] of use 
on a regular basis as a “controller” medication had not changed until recently. A number of studies 
have demonstrated the efficacy of ICS as part of rescue therapy. These studies enrolled tens of 
thousands of individuals and included both ICS plus a short acting beta agonist (ICS SABA)32, 33, [ADDRESS_549325] (ICS LABA).36-[ADDRESS_549326] reduced exacerbations from 7% to 50%. Three years ago the Global Initiative for 
Asthma (GINA)12 added ICS LABA therapy for rescue therapy as the preferred approach in steps 3 
and 4 (see Figure 1) as did the new US guidelines released in December, 2020.24 Based on recent 
studies, GINA recently expanded ICS LABA to all steps as rescue therapy.12 Neither guideline has 
officially addressed ICS SABA rescue therapy, though a number of randomized controlled trials 
showed positive results.32, 33, 39 Our completed pragmatic PREPARE study using ICS SABA in 
participants of African American/Black race or Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity 35 demonstrated a 13% 
reduction in exacerbations, improved ACT scores by [CONTACT_46431] [ADDRESS_549327] 1 point 
at the population level (both greater than the patient MID) and decreased lost days of school or 
work by 20%, all statistically significant.[ADDRESS_549328] of 
SMART therapy across the studies used by [CONTACT_433527] (NAEPPCC) Expert Work Group [ADDRESS_549329] them stop using nebulizers. In our PREPARE study 60% of participants used nebulizers 
intermittently and 40% used nebulizers weekly. In a survey conducted during the study, regular 
users felt their nebulizers were more effective than metered dose medications and indicated they 
had no interest in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_433462].  The PARTICS approach is entirely compatible with 
nebulizer use, in fact, nebulizer users had a greater response to PARTICS than the full population.35 
Thus, the addition of PARTICS as a treatment option alongside SMART solves the nebulizer problem 
without forcing people to make yet another change in their usual therapy.

Page [ADDRESS_549330], the package insert for inhalers containing formoterol (the 
LABA that must be used for rescue therapy) specifically state: “not indicated for the relief of acute 
bronchospasm.”[ADDRESS_549331], a large percentage of people with 
asthma use nebulizers (60% were nebulizer users in our PREPARE study), and integrating ICS as 
rescue therapy with nebulizer use has not been demonstrated until our PREPARE study. The first 
issue is not likely to be addressed soon as formoterol is now generic and thus no pharmaceutical 
company has an incentive to apply for a New Drug Indication. The second is progressing as payers 
are considering the new guidelines. The third requires additional study. Some of these concerns can 
be addressed by [CONTACT_433528], the PARTICS approach. PARTICS adds a stand-alone medium strength ICS to a patient’s 
current therapy. This approach overcomes several of the concerns expressed above: 1) stand-alone 
ICS medications do not have language as part of their package insert indicated they should not be 
used during epi[INVESTIGATOR_97987]; 2) an additional stand-alone ICS has generally been covered 
by [CONTACT_433529], furthermore these medications are typi[INVESTIGATOR_433463] [ADDRESS_549332] 
lower patient co-pays; 3) PARTICS is easily matched with nebulizer use. On the other hand, the 
current PARTICS approach requires the user to carry two different inhalers and thus does not “force” 
the use of ICS with the beta-agonist as the SMART approach does. A combined, single inhaler may 
work better for selected individuals that have difficulty in remembering their therapy and are not 
nebulizer users, for instance SMART may make more sense for many teenagers. Also, formoterol has 
a longer half-life which may have some impact on outcomes. The two approaches compare similarly 
in a meta-analysis performed by [CONTACT_433530], at this point both appear to be logical 
options where patient and clinician preferences can guide the therapy choice.

Furthermore, dissemination of SMART or PARTICS is further complicated by [CONTACT_433531] “increasing ICS at the time of onset of an exacerbation.”24  
Many clinicians report these two recommendations appear incongruent, though they are distinctly 
different. The ROUTINE use of ICS as part of rescue therapy is a different intervention than a short-
term increase in the ICS dose with worsening asthma symptoms.24  Additionally, not all asthma 
patients are steroid responsive. Patients with non-eosinophilic asthma (non-Type 2 inflammation) 
and smokers, among others, may respond less to increases in ICS, regardless of delivery.42-[ADDRESS_549333] will address these research 
needs by [CONTACT_433532] 2 and 5 as presented by 
[CONTACT_433533], as well as adding options for use with nebulizers. For ease of 
reading from here on the use of ICS as part of rescue therapy whether as SMART or PARTICS therapy 
will be referred to as R-ICS, except when the two approaches are being evaluated individually. 
Evidence for Long Term Use of Azithromycin 
Azithromycin (AZ), an azalide macrolide antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties, 
demonstrates efficacy in reducing asthma exacerbations,46, [ADDRESS_549334] been postulated: (1) macrolides have intrinsic immunomodulatory/anti-
inflammatory activity that may be more specific for neutrophil-mediated inflammation;50 and (2) 
macrolides have anti-microbial activity against persistent intracellular infections, particularly 
mycoplasma and chlamydia organisms.51-[ADDRESS_549335] of macrolide therapy even after 
treatment has stopped.55 Our primary research question (Which asthma phenotypes are helped the 
most with AZ treatment?) is mechanism agnostic. Our secondary heterogeneity of treatment effect 
(HTE) indices include C. pneumoniae (Cp) and M. pneumoniae biomarkers to explore the infectious 
construct and a Challenge sub-study after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_433464]. A recent meta-analysis found that the 
population-attributable risk (PAR) of Cp-IgE for chronic asthma was 47% (39%-55%).56 This large PAR, 
along with the recommendations of the recent Cochrane review57 are strong justification for 
inclusion of infectious biomarkers in our study to investigate: (1) the predictive value of infectious 
biomarkers for positive AZ treatment responses;58 and (2) whether infectious biomarkers predict 
prolonged improvements/remissions in asthma after completion of AZ treatment courses.48, 49 
The AMAZES study,46 an AZ-based intervention, demonstrated a 40% decrease in 
exacerbations using AZ. There were no sub-group differences, suggesting broad patient benefit for

Page [ADDRESS_549336] from AZ only in individuals with total eosinophil 
counts < 200/µl.49, [ADDRESS_549337] is more pronounced in non-Type 2 asthma is unclear. 
The guidelines from GINA,60 European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764]/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS),61 
and British Thoracic Society (BTS)62 all include use of AZ as a treatment option for severe asthma. A 
narrative review,63 a systematic review/meta-analysis,[ADDRESS_549338] group of people affected by [CONTACT_433534]-to-head research including macrolide therapy. The Cochrane review recommends: 1) 
clarification of responsive phenotypes; 2) study of infectious biomarkers related to AZ 
responsiveness; 3) clarification of side effects from long term AZ; 4) and whether effects persist 
after therapy is stopped. Should trials indicate positive results that provide clear implementation 
direction, adoption of AZ for uncontrolled asthma would be simple and scalable because prescribing 
AZ is familiar to many clinicians and AZ is a fraction of the cost of ICS/LABA or biologics.
Evidence for Asthma Symptom Monitoring for all participants 
Multicomponent asthma interventions that improve asthma self-management have 
repeatedly been shown to decrease exacerbations and improve quality of life.64 One component, 
Asthma Symptom Monitoring (ASM), is supported by [CONTACT_433535], by [CONTACT_433536]’ awareness of worsening symptoms earlier so that treatment can be adjusted in time to 
avoid exacerbations.65-69 Informed by [CONTACT_433537], US asthma guidelines call for clinicians to 
monitor patients’ asthma symptoms.[ADDRESS_549339] 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_433465], and many are monitoring symptoms through apps or patient 
portals.70 Various drivers, including ASM recommendations,71, 72 pandemic “new normal” remote 
care, and the movement toward value-based purchasing should substantially increase ASM in the 
near future,73, [ADDRESS_549340] to sustain engagement.71, 75-77 Over 85% of the 
population uses smart phones, and there are no longer major differences in use based on income, 
race, or geography.[ADDRESS_549341] demonstrated its ability to effectively 
implement ASM in primary82  and specialty care.76, 77 See Appendix 4 for details on the app.
We will require ASM in all arms of the study with the app as our preferred approach but will 
allow similar approaches built into EHR patient portals or a stand-alone version built in REDCap. Our 
patient stakeholders are very enthusiastic about the possibility of ASM minimizing steroid bursts. 
This approach will allow us to evaluate our asthma interventions in context of where we believe 
ASM will be seven years from now when this study would be completed. Our team has experience 
implementing all of the above ASM options.83-85

Page [ADDRESS_549342] will address multiple questions: 1) Can practices implement the 
interventions and find eligible patients who are willing to be randomized to all four arms of the 
study? 2) Will data collection systems be efficient and facile? 3) What is the impact of adjusting 
doses of AZ on participant side effects? 4) Will clinicians be willing to prescribe azithromycin if a 
central prescription system is not utilized? 5) Can all sites implement Asthma Symptom Monitoring 
(ASM) at the minimally acceptable level? and 6) What safety activities need to be in place related to 
concomitant medications used by [CONTACT_433538] (AZ) arms? 
The feasibility phase will fully engage all stakeholder groups and recheck our randomization 
strata based on EHR queries from the participating practices. The feasibility questions are focused on 
implementation activities of the research cores and local research teams, on clinicians and staff in 
primary care practices and on participants using the therapeutic approaches, including the ASM, and 
reporting their outcomes. We will work closely with all stakeholder groups to refine, review, adjust, 
and perfect the entire research protocol during the feasibility phase. The Data Coordinating Center 
(DCC) will utilize information from the sites to refine their plans. We are confident that the feasibility 
phase will answer the implementation questions posed above. 
The feasibility phase will consist of two distinct interventional activities. The primary 
feasibility study will consist of a full implementation of the study protocol, as detailed below, in 
five different study sites: Harvard/Brigham and Women’s, Mt. Sinai, University of North Carolina, 
Rutgers, and Kelsey- Seybold. We will ask all five sites to recruit [ADDRESS_549343]. The adequacy of the ASM systems for the five full implementation sites will be assessed per 
the protocol discussed below for the remaining, ASM-only, involved sites. The recruited participants 
will be asked to respond to monthly surveys instead of bi-monthly surveys for 3 months to shorten 
the overall feasibility time frame. 
Protocol Amendment (April 1, 2024)
Due to delays in patient enrollment, Drs. Wilson Pace and Dave Mauger would like to add Atrium 
Health/Wake Forest to the group of [ADDRESS_549344]/BWH and Atrium Health/Wake Forest sites will enroll up to [ADDRESS_549345]/BWH and Atrium 
Health/Wake Forest will be 6 participants each with a maximum of 18 each. 
Interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants, at a minimum: 1) a group that 
responded to 100% of surveys, 2) a group that indicated medication side-effects or intervention 
cessation, 3) a group with low survey response rates (responded to only one month of surveys), 4) a 
group on traditional SMART and 5) a group on PARTICS therapy. Participants will be allowed to 
switch their ICS therapy approach during the feasibility and full study. In discussing this, our team is 
clear that having individuals continue on some ICS as rescue therapy would be preferable to having 
participants stop this therapy entirely. Should any individuals switch from one ICS therapy to another 
during the feasibility phase we will seek to talk with all of them concerning their reasons for 
switching. As this feasibility study is fleshed out additional sub-groups may be added. These 
individuals will be asked to participate in brief (approximately 10 - 20 minutes) semi-structured 
interviews. These interviews will be analyzed on an ongoing basis to identify concerns related to the

cut their AZ dose in half. We will include a short set of “exit” questions as part of the 3-month survey 
of all participants related to their participation, concerns, or problems encountered.  
We will also interview four different groups of 5 clinicians each (assuming all three ICS 
groups exist): 
1) clinicians that prescribed both SMART and PARTICS to at least one participant; 
2) clinicians that prescribed only PARTICS to at least 2 participants; 
3) clinicians that prescribed only SMART to at least two participants; and 
4) clinicians that prescribed AZ. 
These interviews will focus on the clinicians shared decision-making process with participants and 
for the two groups that only prescribed one option if they were willing to use the alternative or if 
they felt strongly about the option they had used. For the AZ group we will ask about patient or 
clinician concerns with this therapy for both local clinicians or central prescribing staff at the 
research hubs. 
The remaining sites that didn’t implement the protocol as described above, Reliant Health, 
Atrium Health, University of Washington, University of Colorado and the AAFP NRN, will be asked to 
conduct a feasibility study focused on implementing Asthma Symptom Monitoring approaches. 
Asthma Symptom Monitoring will be offered to study participants AND will also be available for all 
sites to offer to any patient with asthma. As such it is considered a “standard of care” quality 
improvement project. We will consent individuals who are asked to an interview related to their 
experience with the ASM systems at the time of their interview. We are not planning on consenting 
people for use of any of the ASM systems as this is not consistent with their use across asthma 
patients in the participating practices regardless of their study participation. We will ask that each 
site recruit up to [ADDRESS_549347] them for qualitative 
interviews. Verbal consent for the interviews will be obtained at the time of the interview. From the 
participants who signed a HIPAA A form we will ask that the operators of the ASM systems provide 
names of people that completed less than 3 of the 6 weeks (or the lowest reponders if everyone is > 
3 weeks) and those that completed all [ADDRESS_549348] identified our initial “expectations” for 
ASM as shown in Table 3. We are in the process of interviewing all of our sites to determine their 
current implementation of ASM for any condition and for asthma specifically as well as any future 
implementation plans. We will work with existing systems or seek to support efforts that are in 
planning stages for all sites. The sites conducting just the ASM will focus on nuances of ASM that 
may be difficult for the five randomizing sites to recognize as they (the randomizing sites) will be 
focused on recruiting a larger number of participants and implementing the interventions.

The full intervention is focused on individuals with asthma seen in primary care and includes 
individuals with moderate to severe persistent asthma who have experienced an exacerbation in the 
past year or remain in poor control, such that asthma is affecting their daily lives. Our comparisons 
will include a large portion of people with asthma (over 50% of people with asthma should be 
eligible in any given year)15, [ADDRESS_549354] information for clinicians, individuals with asthma 
and their parents/caregivers/guardians concerning optimal approaches to address gaps in asthma 
control. The kinds of questions our stakeholders are excited to better understand include: Does the 
level of controller compliance impact R-ICS therapy outcomes? Should everyone with a history of a 
lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_433466] a trial of azithromycin? For 
people not eligible for biologics, will dual therapy make a noticeable difference in days lost from 
work or school? This large pragmatic trial will address these and many other stakeholder questions. 
Our research questions result in 3 head-to-head primary and 12 secondary comparisons. 
Once heterogeneity issues and exploratory items are included, the iTREAT-PC study will include over 
22 different comparisons in the final analytical plan (see Analysis section for details). Stated briefly, 
our research questions lead to the following Hypotheses: 1) All 3 intervention arms will be superior 
to the control approach in reducing AEX. 2) Participants with high eosinophil counts will have 
significantly better outcomes on R-ICS therapy than on azithromycin. 3) Individuals with lower self-
reported controller adherence will respond better to R-ICS therapy than high adherence individuals. 
4) Smokers and people with significant secondhand smoke exposure will have better outcomes on 
AZ than on R-ICS therapy. 5) Asthma control and quality of life (as measured by [CONTACT_433542] (ACT) and Juniper mini-Asthma Quality of Life (mini-AQLQ) instruments, respectively) will 
significantly improve over baseline in all groups but will be significantly better in the 3 
pharmacologic arms than in the control arm. 
These interventions correspond to actual healthcare options relevant to stakeholders. All 
the interventions are currently available. Single inhaler SMART therapy with an ICS/LABA is currently 
available as a generic product.41 There are multiple medium dose ICS inhalers available to use for

4) VULNERABLE POPULATIONS
Pregnancy and Breast Feeding
Pregnancy is not a contraindication to asthma controller therapy, including ICS, azithromycin, or use 
of ASM. Improved asthma control has been shown to be associated with improved pregnancy 
outcomes. It is unknown if AZ is excreted in breastmilk but is assumed that it is. Out of an abundance 
of caution we will only enroll women that are pregnant or breastfeeding after their maternal or child 
care clinician approves of enrollment. We will not require a pregnancy test or effective birth control 
be used to be enrolled for women of child-bearing age but will ask that they inform us if they 
become pregnant. We will recommend that women on AZ who become pregnant (either arm) to 
stop this treatment, advise them to seek maternity care as soon as they are aware of the possibility 
of pregnancy and to inform their maternity care clinician of their study participation. Should the 
participant and her maternity care clinician feel that continued use of AZ is warranted then she may 
continue on therapy. If the participant is breastfeeding after delivery, the decision whether to 
continue azithromycin will be a shared one between the participant and the infant’s care team. 
Whether or not the participant decides to continue azithromycin or stop it during pregnancy or 
breastfeeding, she will be asked to continue in the study. Pregnant or breastfeeding women in the R-
ICS or control arms of the study will be allowed to continue without interruption.
Adolescents
Children ages 12 to 17 will be included. Individuals aged 12 – 17 will require both parental/guardian 
consent as well as participant assent to be included. Given this study involves currently approved 
medications for adolescents and for use with asthma only one parent or guardian will be required to 
provide consent. 
Prisoners
No prisoners will be enrolled in the study. 
Economically or Educationally Disadvantage Populations
Many of our recruitment sites care for economically or educationally disadvantaged individuals. We 
are not planning on screening for these factors as part of the enrollment process. We do ask about 
educational level attained as well as total household income and number of people in the household 
to be able to calculate if the individual is above or below the poverty level as part of end of study 
analyses. These data are collected after consent. We strive to develop consent forms that are 
between the 6th to 8th grade reading levels. Given the inherent complexity of some medical terms, 
such as azithromycin, some paragraphs may be hard to word within these parameters. While 
consent will mostly be conducted remotely, it will involve real time interactions with a study 
coordinator so that questions can be asked and answered until the person is comfortable with what 
they are consenting to or what they are consenting to for their adolescent. The cost of SMART 
therapy, if not covered by [CONTACT_22241], is prohibitive for many individuals, thus we have an alternative 
treatment approach, PARTICS, that is generally covered by [CONTACT_433545]. AZ is a 
generic medication and generally covered by [CONTACT_22241]. Even if paid for out of pocket the dose used 
in this study (500mg three times week) can be found for $12 to $20 per month at various

7) MULTI-SITE RESEARCH
Most members of the Operations Committee have conducted clinical trials together over the 
past [ADDRESS_549376] and site management approach/plan has 
been developed and proven successful. The research team will deploy all aspects of this plan for this 
project. The multi-component process includes a central educational and learning meeting of all site 
PIs and study coordinators. At this meeting the concepts for the project are explained so that truly 
informed consent can be obtained. The study protocol is reviewed in detail and the site versus 
central responsibilities carefully delineated. During this process sites are encouraged and expected 
to talk with each other and the research team about how to deal with recruitment challenges, 
providing prescriptions to participants, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_433472]. The sites provide extensive feedback to the research team and 
adjustments to the protocol may be made. For this project many of these activities will also include 
all stakeholder groups as outlined in the Engagement section.  All of these groups will be expected to 
work together to review the current protocol and improve or adjust if they feel it is necessary. 
The AAFP NRN staff will begin working with each site’s study coordinator to complete any 
local IRB submissions that are required. Given the requirement to rely on a single IRB we will work 
with each local IRB, through SMART IRB, to develop a reliance agreement with the BRANY IRB, which

associated with the AAFP NRN (Drs. Pace, Hester, Westfall or Israel) will contact [CONTACT_433553] [INVESTIGATOR_433473]. 
After recruitment begins the AAFP NRN staff will schedule weekly meetings with each site 
study coordinator and help them trouble shoot issues that arise as well as maintain communication 
between sites. The senior staff will touch base with the site PIs at least monthly during the Feasibility 
recruitment and follow-up phase. Recruitment figures are reported to the Operations Committee bi-
weekly and monthly summaries are provided to the Executive Committee. The Operations 
Committee is tasked with assuring recruitment meets timelines. Other parts of the communication 
plan include the creation of a study wiki for all study coordinators and site PIs to ask questions and 
seek advice across sites as well as weekly tips that are sent to the study coordinators primarily.
Several months prior to beginning enrollment the AAFP NRN will schedule two recurrent 
meetings per month for site PI’s and study coordinators for ongoing communication. The two 
meetings are identical and each site is expected to attend one or the other. This duplicative system 
allows easier coordination of schedules across multiple sites and has worked well in previous 
studies. This meeting is used to update people on protocol changes (which are also sent via email 
and posted in the Egnyte system discussed below) as well problem solve between sites and provide 
general communication. Should a significant protocol change be required due to safety concerns this 
will be emailed to all site PIs and study coordinators with a return receipt of message included. 
Phone calls to site PIs and study coordinators will be made of there is not clear evidence that the 
protocol change has been received. Study results, interim results that can be shared, protocol and 
IRB updates and premature study closure are handled through these meetings as well. Though final 
study closure typi[INVESTIGATOR_433474] [ADDRESS_549378] two unique folders on the DARTNet Egnyte system which is 
HIPAA compliant and can support sharing of clinical data (one folder per site) as well as study forms 
or files that are site specific (the second folder.) This system will also have shared folders for all sites 
to access and share common documents. 
The REDCap data management system will be used to communicate ongoing project 
information at the participant level. The system will include study forms, such as exacerbation 
follow-up/confirmation forms and adverse event forms that will support direct data entry as well as 
attached documents. Most participant related communication will occur through this study 
management system. 
8) RECRUITMENT METHODS
Study Population and Research Setting(s):  The population for both the feasibility phase and 
full study will be individuals ≥ 12 years of age12 with persistent asthma requiring regular ICS or 
ICS/LABA and cared for in a primary care practice participating in the study. Eligibility and exclusion 
criteria are stated in the named section above. During the feasibility phase each of the Research 
Implementation organizations recruiting for the full study feasibility arm will recruit [ADDRESS_549379] all aspects of the study. The other remaining sites will 
focus on testing the Asthma Symptom Monitoring systems (ASM) by [CONTACT_30224] [ADDRESS_549380] 8 individuals

three will be using the DARTNet REDCap based ASM system. At this time we will only allow adults to 
access the system until we finalize parental verification for adolescent use. Individuals will be 
provided a link to the site that is specific to the clinical organization. Upon registering the individual 
will complete an End User License Agreement and then be offered an option for a possible call back. 
The individual can accept that option or reject that option and use the system without any chance of 
participating in the qualitative interview described below. If an individual accepts the offer to 
potentially be called they will be paid $[ADDRESS_549382] one week out of the 8. If 
they are selected for an interview and they consent and participate in the interview they will be paid 
an additional $25. Two sites will be operating their own ASM systems. Reliant Health Care Group has 
built a system into MyChart and will ask people if they are willing to have Reliant share his/her name

REDCap system loaded into their REDCap.  We will code a HIPAA A form on the DARTNet iTREAT 
Project Management REDCap system for this system to refer interested individuals to. Similarly to all 
other systems the first 15 people that agree to participate will be paid $20 and if they are selected 
for, consent to and participate in an interview they will be paid an additional $25.

recruitment timeframe, providing a minimum of 120 eligible adolescents and over 330 adults per 
clinical site. With a 20% - 25% consent rate, Recruitment Implementation sites will need 10 to 12

Page [ADDRESS_549384] effective recruitment method consisted of EHR searches to find potentially eligible people 
coupled with EHR tracking that notified the research team when a potentially eligible individual had 
scheduled a visit. For sites using this approach the research team will then call the individual several 
days ahead of the appointment to remind the patient of the appointment and ask if the patient 
would be interested in hearing about a research study for which s/he may be eligible. Phone 
recruitment script is provided in Appendix 5. If patients expressed interest and eligibility is 
confirmed, the study would be described over the phone. At that point some individuals may elect 
to consent while others may elect to speak with their clinician first. Of course, some will opt out at 
this point. For those consenting over the phone, study staff will obtain consent, collect baseline data, 
and randomize the patient. If the randomization requires a new prescription is needed, the study 
clinician is notified. If the person elects to talk with their clinician first, a note about the call will be 
sent to the clinician including a reminder about the study within the EHR. After the visit a call back 
occurs to complete the same process. Our PREPARE study shows that over 90% of individuals will 
consent if their clinician indicates the study is safe and reasonable for the individual. At some sites a 
research staff member may meet the individual at the practice after assessing interest and eligibility 
over the phone. Some sites may use cold calls to potentially eligible individuals as well as

discretion to approve future studies on the samples.
12)DATA MANAGEMENT
14.1) Data Analysis 
We are intentionally avoiding the factorial design framework for the purpose of analysis. 
This is because we are uncertain about whether the combined treatments will have an additive 
effect. If the combined effect is less than additive, then the standard main effects analysis based on 
the factorial design is not optimal. The primary analysis will consist of three hypothesis tests 
comparing each of the three treatment arms against the control. We will employ the maximum 
likelihood framework based on the Negative Binomial distribution (with offset to account for 
differential follow-up time due to dropout or treatment failure) to perform these tests.  In addition 
to treatment assignment, the model will also include fixed-effect covariates sex, race, smoking 
history, asthma treatment step at enrollment, TEC and facility with mobile technology, as well as 
multi-level random-effects of organization and practice within organization. As we consider SMART 
and PARTICS approaches to be equivalent these will be combined for the all primary analyses, 
therefore individuals that switch between these approaches will not impact the primary outcome 
analyses.
In the presence of non-compliance, the ITT analysis may underestimate the efficacy of treatment at 
the patient level. Since non-compliance may be driven by [CONTACT_433557], the 
traditional per-protocol analysis of treatment efficacy may introduce confounding bias. We will apply 
causal-inference based methods to adjust for confounders. Particularly, we will perform adjusted 
per-protocol analysis using inverse probability weighting technique, where the probability of 
adherence will be estimated. We will also explore the instrumental variable approach, which does 
not rely on confounder adjustment, but only allows a crossover type of non-adherence. Instrumental 
variable approach can be used to estimate the complier average causal effect for randomized trials 
when certain assumptions are satisfied.
Heterogeneity of Treatment Effect: Additional analyses to examine heterogeneity of treatment 
effect will employ the same modeling framework, except that interaction effects between the 
treatment effect and pre-specified covariates will be included. These include SMART vs PARTICS, 
1500mg vs 750mg AZ dosage, eHealth Literacy, compliance with treatment assignment, TEC, 
smoking, and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092][n (LRTI) onset of asthma.  By [CONTACT_433558], we will be able to determine which of these characteristics might contribute to 
heterogeneity of therapeutic interventions.  We are particularly interested in the following 
hypotheses:
1. AZ will be more effective among those participants that smoke or have a history of LRTI 
onset.
2. R-ICS therapy will be more effective among those with higher eosinophil counts.

Page 22 of 113The DCC team discussed approaches to the heterogeneity analyses concerning people that may 
switch between the two ICS as rescue therapy options. At this point they are not prepared to 
commit to an approach. If the number of people who do switch is low it may not be possible to 
include this as an interaction variable. 
Secondary Outcomes:  Analyses for secondary outcomes including the ACT both as a continuous 
and dichotomized at 20, Quality of Life, and number of school/work days missed due to asthma will 
be conducting using the same framework as the primary analysis in terms of testing strategy and 
covariate adjustment.  However, different likelihood distributions will be used as appropriate. The 
Normal distribution will be used for the ACT continuous and Qualify of Life outcomes, while the 
Binomial likelihood will be used for the ACT dichotomized outcome, and the Negative Binomial for 
the number or school/work days missed due to asthma.  For the outcomes that are repeatedly 
measured, we will expand the mixed-effect models to include subject-specific random effects to 
account for within-subject correlations. As with the primary analysis, we will employ the Bonferroni 
adjustment for the three comparisons of treatment against control separately for each outcome. 
Missing data: For the primary outcome, asthma exacerbations over the [ADDRESS_549387] are missing, multiple imputation methods will be applied to implement the 
mixed-effects models. In our previous PERPARE study overall data missingness was < 4%. 
Exploratory analyses: Utility of Biomarkers for predicting azithromycin treatment outcome: 
Infectious biomarkers, including IgG, IgA, IgE serology and PCR, will be assessed for up to [ADDRESS_549388] our hypothesis that (1) Cp IgA or IgE seropositivity AND a positive PCR OR Mp 
CARDS IgE seropositivity is predicted to be the most responsive to AZ; (2) seropositivity OR Cp PCR 
positivity is predicted to show less AZ response; and (3) IgG only or no positive biomarker results will 
demonstrate the lowest rate or degree of AZ responsiveness. The level of response will be based on 
ACT scores (both ACT continuous and ACT dichotomized at 20). ACT scores (> 3 point improvement) 
will be used to classify patients into responders versus non-responders. We will first examine the 
number of patients in each observed combination of biomarker results and carry out the statistical 
tests for the combinations with sufficient sample sizes. We will compare ACT scores across different 
groups based on biomarker positivity patterns and use linear or logistic regression models to 
evaluate the predictive values of individual biomarkers and combined biomarkers. Prediction 
accuracy measures, such as R-squared (coefficient of determination), will be calculated for linear 
prediction model; ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analyses will be performed for logistic 
regression model to determine the prediction power and area under the ROC curve (AUC), 
sensitivity/specificity, and positive/negative predictive value will be calculated. Ten-fold cross-
validation method will be used to assess and validate the performance of prediction models. Finally, 
we will evaluate if historical and demographic data, including a self-reported lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_433476]’s asthma developed, self-reported controller use at baseline, race, 
and smoking status, add prediction value to the biomarkers. We may potentially have a large 
number of predictors (including interaction terms) to consider, so we will use penalized regression 
methods (e.g., LASSO) to alleviate the overfitting problem.  
Azithromycin Cessation Challenge: The study will include an AZ Cessation Challenge sub-
study among participants in the AZ monotherapy and AZ + R-ICS arms. The primary outcome will be 
asthma control as measured by [CONTACT_433559]-AQoL as secondary 
outcomes. This sub-study is exploratory but tracks entirely with the recommendations of the recent 
Cochrane AZ review57 and the European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764]/American Thoracic Society guideline.[ADDRESS_549389] of ceasing AZ as opposed to not ceasing, but rather 
to identify patient characteristics associated with long term improvement or relapse after AZ is

Page [ADDRESS_549390] and AQoL outcomes we will use mixed-effects models including 
effects for time (on and off AZ), patient characteristics of interest, and interactions between time 
and patient characteristics. The interaction effects will be of primary interest because those can be 
used to identify predictors of changes in asthma control resulting from AZ withdrawal. For the time 
to first exacerbation outcome we will use Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazards model regression 
analysis to identify risk factors for relapse.  
Outcomes for Step-up sub-study: We expect that up to 4 - 6% of participants (N=23 – 48 per 
control and monotherapy arms) may step-up to the R-ICS or dual pharmacologic arms due to 
treatment failures. The primary and secondary outcomes will be ACT and AQoL respectively. As with 
the AZ cessation challenge, the goal of this portion of the study is not to test whether additional 
therapy is superior to continuation on the same therapy, but rather whether there are patient 
characteristics associated with improved outcomes when additional therapy is given. As with the AZ 
cessation challenge, we will use mixed-effects models with interactions between time and patient 
characteristics to identify characteristics associated with response to additional treatment. 
14.2) Study Endpoints 
Primary outcome: The annualized rate of major asthma exacerbations (a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_433477] 72+ hours of oral/parenteral steroids). Major asthma exacerbations are a core 
asthma outcome for asthma clinical research99 and a major health risk (including death) that causes 
distress to people with asthma and their families.100 Our patient and parent/caregiver stakeholders 
overwhelmingly endorse asthma exacerbations that require changes in their daily lives (consistent 
with major exacerbations) as the most important event related to their asthma. Clinicians focus on 
ongoing exacerbations as a marker of poor control (over standardized asthma control instruments), 
and thus endorse this outcome as their most important metric. Policy stakeholders indicate that 
from both an overall society cost, individual’s costs and quality of life perspectives they consider 
exacerbations as the main driver of all three concerns. Our definition of “major exacerbation” is 
aligned with US Guideline Expert Review Panel 4 definition and NIH Asthma Outcome workshop.24, 99 
Secondary outcomes: Asthma control is consistently mentioned by [CONTACT_433560].101, 102 The 
National Asthma Education and Prevention Program's Expert Panel Report 3103 (NAEPP 2007) and 
Report 4,[ADDRESS_549391], Wisnivesky and Bryant-Stephens were members 
or reviewers (Panel 3 or 4), emphasizes the importance of asthma control as a goal of therapy 
because of its relevance to patients and providers in the ongoing assessment of asthma. Based on 
the input of our stakeholders we will use the Asthma Control Test (ACT) to measure asthma control.
Exploratory outcomes: Data, including demographic, historical, and biological data, will be 
collected to define sub-groups of individuals with asthma. The following sub-groups will be 
considered exploratory using the same primary and secondary outcomes:  Black race, positive v. 
intermediate v. negative infectious biomarkers, and overlap syndrome (both an asthma and COPD 
diagnosis). The infectious biomarkers are a highly sensitive PCR for Chlamydia pneumoniae and 
specific serologic tests (including IgA, IgG and IgE) for Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae to guide AZ therapy. 
Outcome Collection 
Participants will complete online surveys that include all outcomes instruments (see Table 
6). Patients will receive survey reminders via automated voice, text, and email messages as well as 
via follow up phone calls. Text and email survey reminder messages are in Appendices [ADDRESS_549392] outcomes directly from participants using standardized instruments 
(ACT,92 mini-AQLQ,98, 104 missed days of work/school105) and the Asthma Exacerbation

Page 24 of 113meaning it will overestimate exacerbations, thus requiring confirmation. But it does not miss 
potential exacerbations. Participants will be asked to complete their surveys every two months using 
various methods. Exacerbations will then be adjudicated through a multi-step process that includes 
the site’s review of EHR or health information exchange data, communication with the patient, and 
occasionally requests for outside medical records. Once the data have been assembled, an initial 
blinded two-clinician review will occur. If there are any concerns or non-agreement at this level, an 
independent adjudication committee will blindly review and make a final determination. The 
standard operating procedures for these activities are well worked out as our team reviewed 
approximately 3000 such events during our PREPARE study. For the full set of analytical groups see 
the Power Analysis/Analysis plans.

based on site level permissions. Each research site will only be able to see their own participants 
while the central research team will be able to see all participants.  Sites may develop tracking 
systems for study recruitment. Site specific data handling is described below. 
               Data elements for participants will include name, date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, 
address, phone number, back up contact [CONTACT_216531]. Data for the research project are 
in the questionnaires that are attached as separate documents. Research data will be retained for [ADDRESS_549397] that participant’s PHI will be deleted when the

Data management for this project will be shared between DARTNet, and the DCC. The 
project will use DARTNet’s HIPAA compliant, secure computing and file sharing resources, Egnyte, 
for sharing files between sites if necessary. Most files will be attached to the correct REDCap form 
that is being completed and stored within the DARTNet REDCap environment in AWS. DARTNet 
operates HIPAA compliant AWS services housed in the Portland, OR, data center. The systems within 
these organizations for this project include file transfer systems, patient-facing data collection 
systems, study management systems, data transformation systems, and data analytical systems. All 
of these systems exist in secure, locked, monitored environments (at the University of Colorado, 
PennState or AWS); all systems are encrypted at rest; and all data transmissions are encrypted at 
AES-1024 or higher level of encryption. Physical servers at the University of Colorado are in a 
climate- and access-controlled environment with 24-hour video monitoring as well as access 
monitoring at the individual level. Nightly, weekly, and monthly back-ups include transaction level 
files and images that are stored both locally and in the cloud. The University of Colorado runs a Palo 
Alto firewall with multiple layers of intrusion detection. Only limited systems are available through 
the firewall. All other systems require VPN, multi-factor authentication to access. The DARTNet 
servers sit in a specific sub-network that is not visible to other users within the University behind a 
second firewall and intrusion detection system, with IP filtering for access. User accounts for both 
organizations require strong passwords and all local machines run centrally monitored and updated 
anti-virus and malware software. 
Pennsylvania State Security: Privacy and data integrity are of critical importance to the 
DPHS. Network access is controlled through multiple layers of protection which, at a minimum,

network IT resources are always controlled using the principle of least privilege, role-based 
authorization. Additionally, the DPHS network and IT systems are protected from security threats by

that cover over 40 million people. 
Data Handling Capacity
DARTNet operates its own physical servers and data storage space in a HIPAA compliant server room 
within the University of Colorado Informatics infrastructure. DARTNet also rents HIPAA compliant 
cloud servers and space from AWS. DARTNet owns multiple physical servers and approximately 1 PB 
of storage space in multiple environmental tiers and behind several layers of security within these 
environments. Within the University of Colorado environment DARTNet operates a multi-tiered, 
multi-dimensional business intelligence system, secure file transfer systems (using Egnyte and the 
AWS cloud) as well as software to merge, translate and de-identify existing electronic health data – 
EHR, claims and patient reported data – into standardized data sets for analytical purposes. We

The Department of Public Health Sciences (DPHS) at Penn State University College of Medicine 
DPHS Information Technology Management Team: The DPHS has dedicated system architects, 
administrators, and technical support/helpdesk staff that design, implement, and support the 
computing environment and specialized technical requirements of faculty, investigators, students, 
collaborative researchers, and staff. The primary environment includes an on-site data center 
housing highly-available VMware vSphere virtualization infrastructure host servers. The 
virtualization infrastructure is leveraged to host dedicated, high performance servers providing both 
dynamic computing scalability and system redundancy.  Within this enterprise-level configuration is 
an integrated network of servers running primarily Microsoft Windows Server and Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux computing platforms.
The department’s Windows servers are used primarily for utility and operational services such as 
secured remote access, department-level application services, and VDI/Virtual Desktop 
Infrastructure (Citrix XenApp, XenDesktop). Additional DPHS-dedicated Information Technology 
stacks include financial/operational systems, educational/learning management systems, 
communication, and collaboration services (e.g. Microsoft Exchange email, SharePoint, document 
management, process workflows, etc.). Linux servers are primarily utilized to provide higher 
performance platforms for Bioinformatics, research, and clinical trials hosting as well as a technology 
innovation sandbox and custom statistical, web application, and database development ecosystem. 
A four-tier configuration is implemented to provide discrete proof of concept/pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/application 
development, quality assurance/acceptance/scalability testing, staging and production hosting 
environments. This architecture provides a proven, stable base for development and testing of 
custom web applications and databases, staging of updates, and deployment of finished software 
into production. Enterprise-level SAN (Storage Area Network) services are based on a highly 
available RAID configuration with additional protection provided through automated hot spare fail-
over disks and self-healing file systems. All critical and production infrastructure are configured with 
subsystem redundancies and proactive hardware, operating system, database and application 
monitoring to support high availability.
 
Additional highlights of the DPHS standard operational computing services include a [ADDRESS_549402] 1 gigabit service to all department servers and clients. Distributed 
file systems are centrally administered, provide over 250 teraby[CONTACT_433566] (RAID) 
storage capacity, and are available to all computing platforms through the use of additional secured 
technologies including Samba, NFS, and SMB/CIFS protocols. 
Modeling best practice ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) and ITSM (IT Service 
Management) principles, DPHS IT staff regularly utilizes critical IT management tools to proactively 
identify and mitigate performance problems. Some of these tools include Oracle Enterprise 
Manager, OSSEC (system health, log and intrusion detection monitoring), Solarwinds Network 
Performance Monitor, Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), BMC Track-It! and 
ServiceNow (helpdesk/technical request/service delivery management).

14.5) Future Use of Data 
Per research best practices a fully de-identified data set of participant demographics, baseline 
characteristics, outcomes, and biospecimen data will be available for other researchers once the 
main effects paper has been accepted. PCORI data retention guidelines require data to be retained 
for [ADDRESS_549410] process – Individual investigators or teams of investigators seeking access to 
data from PCORI-funded studies must complete and submit a data request form to a PCORI-
designated repository. The repository will independently review requests for data based on 
qualifications of the data requestors and the scientific merit of the request (see below). If 
the data request is approved, the data requestor’s institution must enter into a Data Use 
Agreement (DUA) with the repository. The DUA specifies the terms and conditions of data 
use, as well as the responsibilities and obligations of data requestors. Individual investigators 
must enter into an assurance of compliance with the terms of the DUA that shall be 
incorporated as an exhibit to the DUA.
b.Data requestor qualifications – A data requestor that submits a data request will be 
evaluated for its overall qualifications and experience (e.g., across a proposed team of 
specified individuals) to achieve the stated research purpose underlying the data request. 
Neither PCORI nor the Awardee investigators will provide technical assistance directly to 
data requestors. However, either party may provide input to the repository upon request. 
c.Required documentation for data requests – At a minimum, requests for Awardee data must 
include the following elements: a statement of the proposed research purpose, an assurance 
that the data requested will be used to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge, a 
justification that the proposed research can be achieved using the requested data, and a 
data security plan.
i. Data requests for nonscientific uses, such as in support of litigation, general educational 
purposes, quality improvement projects, and for promotional/marketing purposes will not 
be accepted.
ii. Requestors submitting incomplete or unclear requests for data access will be asked to revise 
their request and/or provide all required information.
2. Review of Data Requests
a.Review process – Upon receipt, all requests for data will undergo review by [CONTACT_433576] a PCORI-designated repository. The purpose of the review is to 
ensure that the proposal has scientific merit, in that: the research purpose is clearly 
described; the data requested will be used to develop or contribute to generalizable 
knowledge to inform science, medicine, and/or public health; the proposed research can be 
reasonably addressed using the requested data; the data requestor team has the 
appropriate expertise to conduct the proposed research; and the proposed research 
includes questions and outcomes that are relevant to patients.
b.Review committee – The independent review committee will be convened as needed and 
will be comprised of five voting members: a representative from the PCORI-designated 
repository, a data scientist, a clinical researcher with expertise germane to the data request, 
a PCORI staff member, and a patient representative. Other relevant stakeholders (e.g., 
payers, policy makers) may be invited to participate, as warranted. PCORI Awardees who

DUA strictly prohibit re-identification of any individual who is a subject of the data, as well as 
the redistribution of the data to any entities that are not party to the DUA or individuals who 
have not entered into an assurance of compliance as an exhibit to the DUA.
d.Transparency of data requests – The PCORI-designated repository will post a summary of 
each approved data request that includes the research purpose and identity of requestors to 
its website. Awardees will be notified in the event that a request for their data is approved. 
The posting and notification will occur within five (5) business days of the approval.
e.Transparency of research findings related to data requests – Requestors are required to 
provide a summary of all findings (including negative findings) related to the secondary use 
of Awardee data to the repository for posting to the repository’s website within [ADDRESS_549412].
f.Acknowledgment of Awardees and PCORI – Requestors are required to acknowledge the 
Awardee as the primary source of the data and PCORI as the funder in all publications or 
presentations resulting from secondary use of Awardee data.
Awardee Data Sharing Costs
For Awardees depositing the Full Data Package (or required data elements, as applicable) into a 
PCORI-designated repository, PCORI will cover reasonable costs associated with the time and effort 
needed for preparing, depositing, and maintaining the Full Data Package in the repository for a 
period of at least seven (7) years following acceptance by [CONTACT_87153].
13)PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF SUBJECTS
The majority of participants are expected to be consented using telehealth approaches. 
Thus, consenting adults and assenting adolescents will be in a location of their choosing, presumably 
their own homes. For those individuals consented within a clinical environment, research 
coordinators will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_433577] a routine clinic visit and 
meet them at the clinical site upon agreement to consider study participation. The research staff 
would then use a private space within the clinical area to complete the consent process. The only 
other possible face to face interaction with research staff or clinical staff for sample collection would 
be for a phlebotomy. This visit would not be distinguishable to any other clinically oriented visit for a 
phlebotomy and thus does not expose the participant to loss of confidentiality related to study 
participation. 
After consent, risks to data confidentiality will be mitigated by [CONTACT_433578]-reported outcomes data capture and exacerbation and severe adverse event 
tracking systems. All users of REDCap will be tracked and only provided access in a secure fashion 
following established DARTNet Standard Operating Procedures. These include strong passwords, 
changed every [ADDRESS_549413] access to their personal information, questionnaires appropriate for their 
study arm, and the educational video(s) associated with their arm of the study. Site research staff 
will only have access to the participants enrolled by [CONTACT_23964]. AAFP NRN/DARTNet staff will have 
access to participant contact [CONTACT_433579], as well as reports indicating questionnaire 
completion status for each individual. The REDCap system will automatically lock the monthly 
questionnaire for six weeks following completion by [CONTACT_433580]. The system will automatically remind individuals to complete

another questionnaire is completed. The risks of loss of confidentiality are minimal given the secure, 
central handling of data.
14)ENSURING THE SAFETY OF SUBJECTS 
1. Recruitment and Informed Consent
The research team will work with the Operations Committee and patient partners to draft an 
Informed Consent Template that is as brief as possible and meets IRB requirements. Consent forms 
will be uniform throughout the sites except for minor modifications as required by a site's IRB. We 
expect all sites to use the BRANY IRB. We will work on multiple approaches to completion of 
informed consent, including online, a web (video) conference, over the phone or in person. Each site 
will have a specific consent form present on the online system, and consent will be recorded in the 
online system by [CONTACT_433581]. If 
a local site requires that a paper copy of the consent be retained, sites will be responsible for this 
retention. Participants will be able to download a copy of the consent or will have one mailed to 
them if they wish a hard copy. No participants will be enrolled without documentation of informed 
consent. A waiver of consent for a limited EHR data set will be requested for the analysis. EHR data 
will be collected at the end of the study one time. 
2. Risk of asthma exacerbation
This study is directed toward the reduction of asthma exacerbations. Acute management of 
participants’ asthma is not changed by [CONTACT_433582]’s clinician or 
health system. The use of R-ICS for acute symptom relief or AZ is intended to further reduce the risk 
of exacerbations; no data have been published to show that the use of R-ICS or macrolides increases 
exacerbation potential. Data collection will include assessment of exacerbations. Due to the 
pragmatic nature of the study, no additional interventions will be provided unless the participant has 
an allergic reaction to the ICS/LABA or AZ used for this study. If such is the case both the participant 
and their care site will be notified to assure they have information on the exact medication to which 
the reaction occurred, and the participant’s use of the medication will be discontinued. The 
participant will be asked to remain in the study. 
3. Adverse Event Monitoring
(a) Asthma-Related Adverse Events: Data collection will include assessment of exacerbations. 
Exacerbation care will be at the discretion of treating clinicians and the participant. 
(b) Non-Asthma Adverse Events: We won’t monitor for minor events as these are well characterized. 
We will monitor how many participants require step-down AZ therapy due to side effects.
(c) Serious Adverse Events: These events meet the following criteria: results in death, is life-
threatening, requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], results in persistent/significant disability, or results 
in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. These also include any other adverse event that, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant's health and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. These will be monitored and 
reported to the DSMB by [CONTACT_433583] a bi-annual basis. The DSMB will have the 
discretion to stop the study or one arm of the study if excess severe adverse events occur in one arm 
of the study. The full description for handling adverse events, both serious and non-serious are 
discussed more fully in the DSMP. 
4. Management of Asthma Exacerbations
Acute management of participants’ asthma is not changed or mandated by [CONTACT_433584]’s clinician in their usual manner. Clinicians and participants using R-ICS 
therapy will be advised, per recent US asthma guidelines, to not increase their ICS controller

5. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan/Board
A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan and Board will be appointed by [CONTACT_433585], the frequency of monitoring and monitoring procedures. 
The monitoring plan will be developed with review and modification/agreement of the patient 
partners and stakeholders with final approval by [CONTACT_4318]. All participants will receive written 
instructions on the use of their medications. If participants experience an adverse event, they will 
contact [CONTACT_250251], who will evaluate the participant and determine the nature and 
severity of the event, working with the local site PI a determination of whether the event it is related 
to the study procedures or medications will be made and reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_433586]. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_433486], participant management, and 
follow up to resolution. The DCC will prepare bi-annual reports to be reviewed by [CONTACT_4318]. Annual 
reports will also be prepared by [CONTACT_433587].
The DSMB members will be recruited by [CONTACT_6283]. Mauger and Kong with assistance from [CONTACT_419903], if 
requested. The DSMB members will not be affiliated with any of the organizations participating in 
iTREAT-PC, and will include: at least one individual with asthma expertise, one biostatistician, one 
clinical trialist, one member of the public and one ethicist. The DCC will provide administrative 
support to the DSMB. All communications between the DSMB and research staff will be conducted 
through the DCC through [CONTACT_433655]. The DSMB Charter is attached as Appendix 2. 
15)WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS
The only circumstance we can envision where we would withdraw a study participant is if we 
discovered that they knowingly falsified information to be enrolled in the study, in particular, that 
they did not have asthma. We see this circumstance as extremely unlikely as the enrollment criteria 
require a verified clinician’s diagnosis of asthma at least one year prior to enrollment. Should an 
enrollee elect to stop all study medications or not wish to use the Asthma Symptom Monitoring 
system s/he would still be asked to complete all data collection until the end of their expected 
enrollment period and would be paid for submitting data and be eligible for raffle payments. The 
primary outcome is based on an intent to treat analysis and thus we have no intent to remove 
subjects whether they follow study protocols or not. As we are not providing study interventions, in 
the unlikely event we remove someone from the study we would contact [CONTACT_433588]. We would shut down their REDCap account. If the 
individual wished to continue on any study medications they have been prescribed they may do so 
as their prescription is not being paid for by [CONTACT_1758]. Renewals of the prescription(s) would be 
between the individual and his/her asthma clinician. There are no required procedures as part of the 
study. If requested to have either a CBC drawn of if requested to provide a blood draw for infectious 
biomarkers, an individual may decline and it will not impact their ongoing enrollment in the study.
16)RISKS TO SUBJECTS
This study will add interventions to the participant’s current therapy:  PRN ICS/ LABA, (potentially 
PRN ICS/ SABA,) AZ (initially at 500 mg/three times per week or 10 mg/kg three times per week to a 
maximum of 500 mg/dose), or a combination of these. Participants in the R-ICS arms may require a 
change in their controller medication if they are on an ICS/LABA containing salmeterol. In these 
individuals a change to budesonide/formoterol, guided by [CONTACT_39359]’s current ICS dosage, will be 
made. All other changes in participant medications will be made by [CONTACT_2299]’s personal 
clinician or a research clinician who is clinically active within the participant’s Research 
Implementation site. At baseline, participants will either be on ICS/LABA combination, or on ICS

Medication Fulfillment
Participants randomized to the pharmacology intervention arms will receive a prescription to fill at 
their usual pharmacy. Those currently having an asthma exacerbation will be considered to be 
uncontrolled and will be asked to see their physician to re-evaluate treatment before enrolling. They 
will be eligible 30 days after the current exacerbation. All participants will be informed that the 
alternative to participation is to continue their baseline asthma therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. We will continue to work 
with budesonide/formoterol manufactures to determine if any of them (currently 3 in the US) would 
consider donating product for the study (TEVA donated ICS for the PREPARE study) but given the 
current package insert none of them will currently consider this nor are they offering a MAP 
programs specifically for SMART. We will utilize MAP programs with a focus on "controller" therapy 
if required for the conversion to budesonide/formoterol. AZ is relatively inexpensive and as a generic 
offered by [CONTACT_433589]. 
Inhaled Corticosteroids Risks
All participants will be prescribed daily ICS maintenance therapy prior to enrollment. Low adherence 
to controller medication will not impact enrollment.  Overall corticosteroid dosing may be increased 
in the R-ICS intervention groups, especially in the short term. However, efficacy studies of the R-ICS 
approach suggest that total ICS dose will actually decrease due to improved participant control. 
Additionally, since we are targeting a group that has a high risk of exacerbation, for many 
participants the total yearly dose of corticosteroids will be decreased even further due to avoidance 
of oral corticosteroid bursts resulting from the decrease in asthma exacerbations. Participants will 
be informed that when taken at high doses for extended periods, ICS can produce hoarseness, sore 
throat, and thrush, as well as rarely cause osteoporosis, adrenal gland suppression, weight gain, 
bruising of the skin, and diabetes, and to see their physician if they experience bruising, acne, 
hoarseness, or fatigue. ICS use has also been associated with reduced growth velocity in children, 
but mostly at ages under 12.
Azithromycin Therapy
Azithromycin is approved for all ages included in this study. When taken with asthma medications, 
AZ has no greater risk for side effects than amoxicillin. AZ should not be used in people with an 
allergy to a macrolide, or on other medications known to prolong the QT interval (we will provide a 
list to prescribers which will be checked by [CONTACT_433590]). Azithromycin, like 
most antibiotics, can result in Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. Individuals developi[INVESTIGATOR_433487], if they develop a fever or severe diarrhea, to be tested for 
C. difficile. If the diarrhea resolves in ≤5 days they will be restarted using a step-down dose. AZ is 
associated with hearing loss in a small percentage of people. This is typi[INVESTIGATOR_433488]. Participants will be asked to report any hearing loss and will be asked about hearing 
with each bi-monthly survey. AZ is associated with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain in 2–5% of 
people taking multiple doses. Other side effects in <1% of people include dizziness, vertigo, 
headache, fatigue, somnolence, and chest pain. Participants who experience mild side effects will 
have the medication stopped for 5 days and then restarted at the next step-down dose. The step-
down doses will be from 500 mg 3x weekly (10 mg/kg) to 500 mg 2x weekly (10 mg/kg) to 250 mg 3x 
weekly (5 mg/kg/dose 3x weekly). AZ is considered safe for use in pregnancy, but we will not enroll 
women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. If a woman becomes pregnant during the study while on 
AZ, we will recommend that she stop therapy but continue in the study. If her maternity care 
clinician believes that continued use of AZ is beneficial then she will be allowed to continue the 
therapy until delivery or 38 weeks gestation, then therapy will be stopped to avoid exposure to her 
infant through breastfeeding. We will recommend that participants in the AZ interventions who start 
taking other antibiotics during the course of the study, stop taking AZ.  Participants can restart AZ

Azithromycin. The Informed Consent will state: Azithromycin is an antibiotic approved for use in the 
US and is frequently prescribed to treat respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073]. Long-term use of azithromycin has 
recently been included in all major asthma guidelines as a treatment option for people with severe 
asthma. We are using the same weekly dose of azithromycin that is FDA-approved to treat 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], and repeating this dose weekly to see if we can identify which people with 
uncontrolled asthma will benefit and who will not. This knowledge will help doctors to prescribe 
azithromycin for asthma more accurately and will help to avoid antibiotic overuse in the future. 
Azithromycin is generally well tolerated but there are a number of possible side effects. These 
include:
•Diarrhea (5%)
•Abdominal pain (3%)
•Nausea (3%)
Side effects reported with a frequency of less than 1%:
•Rash, itching, swelling, sun sensitivity)
•Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], chest pain
•Flatulence, black stool, yellow skin
•Yeast infection, vaginal irritation, kidney inflammation
•Abnormalities of liver enzymes
•Fatigue
All these side effects improve by [CONTACT_433591][INVESTIGATOR_309901]. The dose of 
azithromycin may be cut by 50% for side effects. 
Another potential problem with azithromycin is due to its bacteria-killing properties, which could lead 
to the development of resistance in bacteria that might be in your airways (that means that bacteria 
lose their sensitivity to being killed by [CONTACT_433592]). There is evidence that this can happen, but so 
far, no adverse consequences have been seen. Importantly, if you should develop a chest infection 
and the bacteria are resistant to azithromycin there are many other types of antibiotics that can be 
used. You should also know that people randomized to long-term azithromycin in several large 
studies actually had significantly fewer epi[INVESTIGATOR_433489]. Although there is no evidence that 
antibiotic resistance will harm you directly our study will look for spread of resistant bacteria into 
your community by [CONTACT_433593][INVESTIGATOR_433490].
Some studies of long-term azithromycin have reported a low frequency (<1%-2.8%) of hearing loss 
that was mostly reversible after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_433491].
Asthma Symptom Monitoring
The risks of use of Asthma Symptom Monitoring, such as with the smartphone application, are 
considered minimal. There is a small risk of loss of data confidentiality during data collection and 
transmission. The various data collection approaches will include encrypted data transmission and 
encryption at rest for the stored data. Once in the clinical EHR, the data is at no greater risk than 
other EHR data for loss of confidentiality. For adolescents there is the requirement for shared 
information with parents/guardians. There is a small risk that individuals having a severe 
exacerbation would delay seeking treatment at an emergency room or urgent care center while 
waiting for a reply from their office. It will be clearly indicated that Asthma Symptom Monitoring is 
not for emergency communication. All ASM applications will specifically instruct people to expect a

will ask that they inform us if they become pregnant. We will recommend that pregnant women on 
AZ (either arm) to stop this treatment until discussing with her maternity care provider. We will 
advise all women to seek maternity care as soon as they are aware of the possibility of pregnancy 
and to inform their maternity care clinician of their study participation. Should the participant and 
her maternity care clinician feel that continued use of AZ is warranted then she may continue on 
therapy until delivery or 38 weeks gestation, whichever comes sooner. Pregnant or breastfeeding 
women in the R-ICS or control arms of the study will be allowed to continue without interruption.
Asthma Questionnaires Risks
There are minimal risks associated with questionnaires. The surveys do not ask sensitive questions or 
about mental health. The main risk from the surveys is loss of confidentiality if someone were to 
hack an email or text message or if the survey database is breached. Someone with illicit access to a 
participant’s email or text messages would not be able to see any of the participant’s answers, but 
by [CONTACT_433594]. The database servers for REDCap related 
systems are located in secure, HIPAA compliant data centers with multiple layers of intrusion 
detection. The servers are encrypted at rest and all transmissions are encrypted in transit. The 
greatest threat to a data breach were if someone were to intercept an email or text message to a 
participant or uncover a username [CONTACT_433644]. If this was for a participant, then 
the hacker may be able to see the participant’s latest survey data, but generally the messages link to 
a new survey, and old information will not be viewable. If this was a research staff member’s login 
then the hacker could see potentially all participants’ information for that site or if it was one of the 
central staff they could see all participant’s information. Research staff will be required to use strong 
passwords and change them every [ADDRESS_549415] one 
performed by [CONTACT_433595] a centrally contracted laboratory. Individuals in the AZ arms will be 
offered the opportunity to undergo mycoplasma and chlamydia serology testing and chlamydia PCR 
testing. These blood tests involve a venipuncture that poses no greater risk than usual clinical care.  
17)POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS
The potential benefit to participants in the intervention arms is unknown, but may include 
decreased exacerbations, decreased symptoms, and reduced need for asthma medications. 
Implementation of ASM at all primary care practices may improve rates of asthma control. The 
potential for benefit to society and individuals with asthma is very significant as the study

reduce exacerbations or improve other important outcomes differentially, then each approach can 
easily be adopted in the context of current care. 
18)COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH
This research is not a classic community-based participatory research project. That said, it has and 
will be heavily guided by [CONTACT_433596], including patients and caregivers, that are invested in 
the project and its results. Thus, we have included our engagement approach here, but again, it is 
not CBPR.
Substantial commitment to and demonstrated experience with effective stakeholder 
engagement is a major strength of iTREAT-PC. A variety of stakeholders have been involved 
throughout the study design and will continue to inform the project in both phases as well as 
implementation, interpretation, and dissemination efforts. Eight stakeholder groups including 1) 
patients/caregivers, 2) patient advocacy groups, 3) clinicians (physicians, nurses, and pharmacists), 
4) professional societies, 5) healthcare policy experts, 6) payers, 7) asthma experts and researchers, 
and 8) site research teams have all been engaged in formulating our questions, identifying the study 
groups, selecting the interventions, choosing outcomes, and suggesting the exploratory aims and 
analyses for this study. Experienced individuals have accepted stakeholder roles for all these groups; 
each iTREAT-PC implementation site will provide clinical and local researcher stakeholders along 
with two patient stakeholders. Due to their in-depth understanding of local contexts concerning 
community and research partnerships, site PIs are best suited to identify appropriate participant 
stakeholders from sites. Site PIs have been consulted during the development process. In addition to 
ongoing engagement of select stakeholders from PREPARE, we have worked with several new 
stakeholders in all categories to provide continuous feedback in the development of this proposal. 
For iTREAT-PC, we have support from the American Lung Association, Asthma and Allergy 
Foundation of America; stakeholders who represent payers, policy makers; and individuals that will 
represent the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma 
and Immunology and the American College of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology. The American 
Academy of Pediatrics, the National Medical Association and the National Hispanic Medical 
Association will only appoint representatives after a project is funded due to high request volume. 
Our scientific advisors are experienced asthma researchers. Once these groups have met with the 
central research staff, stakeholders will advise if additional groups or individuals from a specific 
group should be added to support project activities.
Our stakeholders will be integral members of the study team with decision making authority. 
Specific changes will continue to be made to the iTREAT-PC study based on input, meeting 
outcomes, and comments from our stakeholders. The eight stakeholder groups will be divided into 
six work groups (WGs): 1) those directly impacted by [CONTACT_433597] (WG 1: patients and caregivers); 2) decision-makers related to informing and advocating for 
therapeutic options (WG 2: advocacy, policy, and payers); 3) organizations that notify medical 
professionals about cutting-edge research advancements (WG 3: professional societies); 4) 
individuals who would deliver demonstrated options (WG 4: clinicians; clinical administrators); 5) 
individuals who oversee and guide the research process (WG 5: asthma experts and researchers); 
and 6) individuals implementing research activities within their practices (WG 6: site research 
teams). These groupi[INVESTIGATOR_433492]. We will 
have separate meetings with the six WGs. A few of our stakeholders hold multiple roles (e.g., 
individual with asthma who is caregiver of a child with asthma, with scientific knowledge). These 
individuals possess unique perspectives and can share experiential knowledge from multiple 
viewpoints. All individuals will have a primary stakeholder role and may be asked to participate in a 
secondary role based on their experience. All WGs will have one or two members on the Ececutive 
Committee (a WG can chose to have one or two). These individuals will present to the Executive 
Committee at each meeting to facilitate communication. During WG meetings information that is

Page 41 of 113relevant from one WG will be presented to another group.  WGs will also combine for meetings as 
appropriate or requested by [CONTACT_433598]. Differing recommendations across WGs wil be presented to 
the Executive Com. (and the Scientific Com if the recommendation impacts the science of the study) 
for consideration. Final decisions will take into consideration the Scientific Com if required and 
adjudicated by [CONTACT_433599].
Engagement Approach: 
The primary research question has been affirmed as patient-centered and crucially 
important by [CONTACT_433600]: asthma patient stakeholders, asthma 
researchers, policy stakeholders (a former state Medicaid director and a former PBM manager), and 
clinicians (primary care, allergy and pulmonology). Each stakeholder group will have two 
representatives on the Executive Committee (EC). The full stakeholder group will meet at least 
annually; subgroups will meet regularly based on project and stakeholder input/needs. Stakeholders 
will meet frequently during the feasibility phase and first year of the full project (see Table 7). All 
final study directions and major decisions will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1383]; thus, all 
stakeholder groups will have decision making authority. At a minimum, all patient facing information 
will be approved by [CONTACT_433601]. All implementation activities will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_433602], and all research decisions will be reviewed by [CONTACT_433603]. All 
outcome assessments will be reviewed by [CONTACT_433604]/caregiver, 
advocacy/policy/payer, professional society, and scientific groups. Using this engagement approach, 
our PREPARE stakeholders have consistently indicated they feel valued, involved, and listened to.

group composition.)

Other  Stakeholders
In the feasibility phase and throughout the implementation of the entire project, other 
stakeholder groups may be deemed important. Should the need for inclusion of new or different 
stakeholder representation emerge, we will identify, engage, and integrate new stakeholders as 
appropriate. Through the feasibility phase, the patient and other stakeholder partners will have 
direct roles and influence in re-drafting the study materials, videos, and implementation of the 
project. The initial draft protocol will be presented to the EC for approval to begin the Vanguard. 
During the Vanguard implementation and interpretation, protocol adjustments may be made 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_433493], and a final protocol will be developed for EC approval. After the Vanguard 
process, conference and webinar-supported calls with our stakeholders will continue to assure 
continued engagement with all stakeholders on schedules that change with the phase of the trial 
(Table 7). At least one member of the operations committee will be assigned to one stakeholder 
partner WG ensuring continuity in communication. 
19)SHARING OF RESULTS WITH SUBJECTS
The iTREAT-PC study team is committed to returning results to the individuals who take part 
in this project. We have experience sharing information with participants, even prior to the end of 
the study, even within the confines of a randomized trial. We have done this in our PREPARE study 
when we needed to communicate with patients about COVID-19. We also shared information about 
how to establish ongoing treatment as people exited the study. 
For iTREAT-PC, Drs. Pace and Mauger, working in particular with Drs. Callen and Filippi, will 
ensure that processes are in place to achieve and maintain timely and accessible information in a 
manner that is understandable and usable. We will develop a lay summary of the findings through a 
collaborative process with all stakeholder groups, particularly the patient and parent/caregiver

Page [ADDRESS_549417] them to the DARTNet, AAFP and partner 
organizations’ websites, and let participants, stakeholders and AAFP members know when and 
where the results are available. To reach individual participants, we will rely on a key aspect of the 
study design:  the regular contact [CONTACT_433605]-reported outcomes. The patient-reported outcomes will be solicited via phone, 
email, or text through REDCap.  Because we require this ongoing interaction with participants during 
the trial, we can harness the same communication technologies to distribute information about the 
findings of the study, both at the conclusion and throughout the study period. We will ensure that 
this aspect is included in consent forms so that we have full ability to communicate with patients 
regarding aggregate study results after the end of the trial. We will also ensure that this 
communication is in accordance with all applicable laws.
Our first approach to returning the summary of the study results will be an automated 
communication to participants that includes an explanation of the purpose of the communication, 
along with a URL to an online presentation of the study findings summary. Second, for patients who 
do not access the URL or who request a hard copy, we will mail a summary to ensure thorough 
outreach to our participants. Combined, these approaches will provide wide access to research 
findings, both to study participants as well as the broader public.
We also have the capability of creating personalized feedback reports at the end of the study 
that summarize individual information over the 16+ months in the trial. We will work with our 
patient partners and determine if they believe this is an important value add that we should 
implement.
20)PRIOR APPROVALS
Local IRBs will be asked to sign a reliance agreement with BRANY. The consent and assent forms will 
be created with editable sections. Each local IRB will be asked to review the consent and make 
locally REQUIRED edits within these sections. Once these edits have been made the consent/assent 
forms will be returned to BRANY for final approval. 
21)COMPENSATION FOR RESEARCH-RELATED INJURY
We believe the research will be considered minimal risk as all interventions are currently available 
for the treatment of asthma. Each site will review, edit if necessary and approve the research related 
injury clause in the consent form. This clause will indicate that the site will provide care for a 
research related injury, or refer the individual to a location that can provide care. Such care will be 
billed to the individual’s insurance carrier. 
There is no relevant contract language related to compensation for research-related injuries. 
22)ECONOMIC BURDEN TO SUBJECTS
Participants will be responsible for paying for any co-pays required for study prescribed medications, 
should they elect to take the medication. PCORI specifically prohibits the inclusion of these costs as 
part of study costs. Medication selection for the different approaches to ICS rescue therapy may be 
made on the basis of cost to the participant. Virtually all insurance plans include a stand-alone ICS as 
a Tier 1 medication with either no co-pay or very low co-pays. Azithromycin is covered as a Tier 1

Page 44 of 113medication by [CONTACT_433606]. For individuals without any insurance coverage 
azithromycin as the full dose of 500mg three times a week is available for a little as $12/month. The 
250mg dose can be found for under $6/month. Inhaled corticosteroids are more expensive with 
Pulmicort one of the lowest cost ICS MDIs. Pulmicort costs approximately $[ADDRESS_549418] monthly costs. The majority of 
participants (based on our previous study results) can be expected to use 2 to 4 MDI canisters over 
the life of the study. 
23)CONSENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION
Routine Consent
Study coordinators at each research site will perform the consents. These are research 
trained individuals with human subjects training that the central team will work with to be sure they 
understand the consent, the study and their role. We expect many will have master’s degrees and 
virtually all the rest will have bachelor’s degrees. We will train them. Have them watch a mock 
consent by [CONTACT_433607] a teach back where they walk 
through the process and then consent one of the central team that will have sets of questions 
concerning the study to be asked of the site personnel. We have used this approach on numerous 
multi-site studies with a high level of success. 
The consent process will be either in person or done remotely by [CONTACT_433608]. We expect the eligibility and consent process to take 30 – [ADDRESS_549419] the consent. We will emphasize to study coordinators that it is essential the 
people are free to decide to participate or not and free to drop out at any time. In a study where 
each site generally has hundreds if not thousands to eligible individuals the need to obtain consent 
from any one individual should be lessened. Given that we are not providing free medication access 
or a large sum of money for participation we believe the study protocol has focused on avoiding 
coercion and we will strive to impart that approach to all consenting individuals. 
The consent form has “check questions” built into it to try and capture misunderstandings of 
key points. Consent check questions are provided in Appendix 8. While these questions are not 
designed to stop the consent process but to provide points where further clarification can be 
provided by [CONTACT_58041]. The consent itself is written in simple terms and will be 
extensively reviewed by [CONTACT_433609]. Study coordinators will 
be instructed to read the consent aloud if any appears to be having issue interpreting the document. 
We do ask health literacy questions as the first part of our enrollment process to help guide the 
study coordinator’s work with patients, but that is by [CONTACT_433610]. If an 
individual is at risk for health literacy issues once those questions are asked we will have the study 
coordinator’s check along the way with people about their understanding of their activities related 
to the study. 
The study will involve standard, formal consent processes for both components of the feasibility 
phase. For the full study feasibility component consent/assent will be primarily by [CONTACT_433611], commercial video conferencing 
systems or plain phone conversations. These same approaches will be used for the Asthma Symptom 
Monitoring component of the feasibility phase of the project. Either consent/assent process could

Page [ADDRESS_549420] control of and decision-making authority for continuing, 
waiting, or changing to a more private location if desired. If in a central research site then consent 
will occur in a private space that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_433494]/or interview like 
activities. If in a clinical site then the consent will take place in a private area, such as an exam room, 
within the clinical space. It is not expected that many consents will be done in clinical settings. 
Consents will be available in REDCap in both English and Spanish. The participant will “sign” the 
consent using their finger or a mouse within the REDCap system. This will be the same approach for 
the assent process. Should consent be obtained over the phone then the consent will be obtained 
after two paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_243305]/assent has been sent to the potential participant. Consent and 
assent will then be recorded over the phone and the participant and adolescent if assent is required 
will be asked to physically sign one copy of the consent and assent and mail them back in a provided, 
postage paid envelope. These “hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]” will be scanned and uploaded to REDCap. The recording 
will also be uploaded to REDCap. 
Non-English Consents
Study staff obtaining consent in Spanish will be bilingual. If a site needs support for the consent 
process in Spanish the site will, through a locally used interpreter process, ask the potential 
participant if a member of the central research staff can join the consent meeting. If the person 
agrees then a bilingual member of the central research staff will join the meeting to serve as an 
interpreter who understands the study and has CITI training. This will be done in conjunction with 
the local research staff that will be the “responsible party” for obtaining consent. 
Should the individual indicate they are not comfortable with a central research staff joining the 
meeting then the meeting can be rescheduled for a time when a local bilingual study staff member is 
available, the participant can agree to a local translator to translation service or the person will not 
be consented. At this time the study does not intend to support other languages than English and 
Spanish.
Assent Processes
The study plans to enroll individuals ages [ADDRESS_549421] the study outcomes are entirely dependent on 
participants’ ability to answer regularly administered surveys.
Other items
No waiver of consent or waiver of storage of consent is requested. The trial is therapeutic in nature 
and no devices are being used. 
24)DRUGS OR DEVICES
While the project does involve drugs, these drugs will be dispensed by a pharmacy of the 
participant’s choice and only be handled in accordance with typi[INVESTIGATOR_433495]. Neither the central 
research team nor any of the sites will handle, store or dispense any medications.

Charter
Data and Safety Monitoring Board
iTREAT 
 Version 1.1 6/23/[ADDRESS_549448] (DSMB) for the Individualizing Treatment 
for Asthma in Primary Care (iTREAT) trial. The DSMB may review this charter at regular intervals to 
determine whether any changes are needed.
iTREAT: Twenty-five million people have asthma in the US with over 45% experiencing one 
or more exacerbations (worsening of symptoms that disrupts their lives) per year.  Asthma 
exacerbations cause many lost days from school or work and account for over 3,[ADDRESS_549449] commonly as 
Single Maintenance And Reliever Therapy (SMART). Long-term (>6 months) therapy with 
azithromycin (a macrolide antibiotic) has demonstrated similar reductions in asthma exacerbations 
to SMART therapy. Asthma is recognized as including clinical and biological variations. Which 
variations respond best to SMART versus azithromycin is not clear. Furthermore, the two have not 
been studied when used together. 
The Individualizing Treatment for Asthma in Primary Care study will be a four-arm study with 
[ADDRESS_549450] their asthma symptoms using home monitoring tools.  The primary outcome will be 
yearly asthma exacerbation rates compared across the three intervention arms to the control arm. 
Secondary outcomes will be asthma control (Asthma Control Test or ACT) and asthma quality of life 
(mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire.) To study the impact of asthma variations, the analyses 
will include total blood eosinophil counts, infectious biomarkers for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and 
Chlamydia pneumoniae, smoking status, health literacy, onset of asthma associated with a lower 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_433503]/African American race.  We hypothesize that all treatment arms 
will be better than the control arm. We hypothesize that SMART therapy will work better in non-
smokers or those with high total blood eosinophil counts or in people with lower health literacy. We 
hypothesize that azithromycin will work better in smokers or individuals with an associated lower 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_433504]. 
Participants will come from primary care practices from across the [LOCATION_002]. 
Participants must have an asthma diagnosis for at least one year, be at least [ADDRESS_549451] score <20. After consent, participants will complete surveys 
every other month for 16 months. Possible exacerbations will be validated by [CONTACT_433616]. People who experience three exacerbations in <[ADDRESS_549452] treatments increased if not already in the dual treatment arm. People in the 
control arm will move to SMART therapy while people in either single therapy will move to dual 
therapy. These participants would be followed for an additional 12 months. Individuals who finish 
either of the azithromycin arms will be offered 6 additional months of follow-up after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_433505]. How well participants and people in the practices are able to carry out the study 
will be tracked using an approach called PRISM/RE-AIM.

Study results can be used by [CONTACT_433617], and by [CONTACT_433618].  
Stakeholders are integral members of the study team with decision making authority 
Stakeholder groups including 1) patients/caregivers, 2) patient advocacy groups, 3) clinicians 
(physicians, nurses, and pharmacists), 4) professional societies, 5) healthcare policy experts, 6) 
payers, 7) asthma experts and researchers, and 8) site research teams have been engaged in 
formulating the research questions, identifying the study groups, selecting the interventions, 
choosing outcomes, and suggesting the exploratory aims and analyses.

Responsibilities of the DSMB
The DSMB is responsible for safeguarding the interests of study participants, assessing the safety, 
efficacy, and quality of study procedures, and monitoring the overall conduct of the study.
The DSMB is an independent advisory group charged with providing recommendations about 
starting, continuing, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study.  As appropriate, the DSMB is also asked to review and 
make recommendations to the Sponsor about the following:
•Study protocol and consent forms, including any amendments
•Whether any new data from other sources affect the equipoise of the studies being 
monitored
•Adherence to protocol requirements
•Completeness, quality, and analysis of measurements 
•Performance of individual centers and cores
•Management of abnormal findings (incidental findings and adverse events)
•Selection, recruitment, and retention of participants
•Benefit/risk ratio of procedures 
•Participant burden
•Participant safety

Page 58 of 113Organization and Interactions
DSMB Members and Study Personnel 
DSMB members and their expertise are listed in Appendix A.  Study Staff and their responsibilities 
are listed in Appendix B.  Consistent with PCORI policy, the DSMB has an assigned Executive 
Secretary (ES) to provide an unbiased interface between the Sponsor and the DSMB, especially 
during executive sessions.  The Data Coordinating Center Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for 
assuring the accuracy and timely transmission of the final recommendations and DSMB summary.
Communication between Investigators and the DSMB
Communication between Study Staff and DSMB will be through the ES in coordination with the PI. It 
is expected that Investigators will not communicate with DSMB members directly except at 
meetings. 
Scheduling, Timing, and Organization of Meetings
Meetings will occur by [CONTACT_152577].  Meetings will be held approximately twice a year, with 
additional meetings scheduled as needed.  Meetings and any interim calls will be scheduled by [CONTACT_433619]. 
At the first meeting, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_433506]. The 
DSMB will review and discuss this charter, and learn about the iTREAT study. The DSMB will review 
and make recommendations about human subjects’ safety and ethics of the protocol, participant 
consent document, and other study materials, and discuss the safety monitoring guidelines.  
Enrollment in the study cannot begin until the DSMB’s recommendation for approval has been 
accepted by [CONTACT_1026]. 
The agenda for DSMB meetings will be drafted by [CONTACT_978].  The ES will finalize the agenda after 
consultation with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_433507].  ES will make the agenda and meeting materials available 
to the DSMB members at least [ADDRESS_549454] or design. The DSMB will review the consent periodically and/or as needed and 
consider whether the consent form requires revision in light of any new findings or amendments.  
In addition to regular meetings, it may be necessary to convene the DSMB urgently on an ad hoc 
basis to discuss new data or other information that raises questions about equipoise, safety, or 
anything else in the trial.
It is expected that all DSMB members will attend every meeting.  However, it is recognized that this 
may not always be possible.  A quorum of this DSMB is considered to be a majority of the members.

Page 59 of 113DSMB Meeting Format 
For each meeting the PI [INVESTIGATOR_433508].  Reports will be separated into Open Session and Closed 
session sections.  
DSMB meetings will be organized into open, closed, and executive sessions.
•During open sessions, information will be presented to the DSMB by [CONTACT_433620].  PCORI staff may attend open sessions, unless the DSMB Chair decides 
that the presence of PCORI staff may inhibit free and open discussion or appear to 
compromise the DSMB’s independence.
•During closed sessions, the DSMB and unblinded statistician will discuss confidential data, 
including any necessary information on efficacy and safety by [CONTACT_2939].  The DSMB 
reviews masked data, with option to unmask at any time they choose.  If the closed session 
occurs on a conference call, steps will be taken to ensure that only the appropriate 
participants are on the call, and to invite others to re-join the call only at the conclusion of 
the closed session.
•The DSMB may elect to hold an executive session in which only the DSMB members are 
present.  The ES may attend the executive session at the invitation of the DSMB Chair.  If the 
ES does not attend the executive session, the DSMB Chair will be responsible for 
summarizing the DSMB’s discussion and recommendations.  The DSMB can request to have 
other staff members attend the executive session to provide additional information as 
needed.
Voting on recommendations will follow Robert’s Rules of Order.
At the conclusion of the closed and executive sessions, the DSMB chair will provide a summary of 
the preliminary recommendations to the investigators to provide an opportunity for investigators to 
ask questions to clarify the recommendations.  The meeting is then adjourned.
The ES will prepare Meeting Minutes and formal Summary Recommendations to be approved by [CONTACT_433621].
Reports of DSMB Deliberations
•Reports for IRBs:  If the DSMB does not identify any safety or other protocol-related 
concerns, within [ADDRESS_549455] Recommendations indicating that: 
•a review of outcome data, adverse events, and information relating to each study 
performance (e.g., data timeliness, completeness, and quality) across all centers 
involved in the study took place on a given date; 
•the observed frequency of adverse events did not exceed what was expected and 
indicated in the informed consent; 
•the DSMB recommends that the study continues without modification of the 
protocol or informed consent.

If DSMB identifies concerns necessitating protocol and/or informed consent changes, the 
Summary Report will outline the concerns, the DSMB’s discussion of the concerns and the 
basis for any recommendations that the DSMB has made in response to the concerns.  
•A copy of the Summary Report will also be provided to PCORI.  If the DSMB recommends 
major protocol and/or informed consent changes, they will be reviewed with PCORI prior to 
implementation. 
Statistical Monitoring Guidelines
There is no pre-planned efficacy or futility analysis; study protocol details safety interim analysis.

Patient/caregiver levelNow that you have implemented the study for a few months we want to 
understand the type of patient that has been most likely to participate in the 
study. How did you decide who to select from your patient panel?
Probes: 
•Given the past couple of weeks implementing the study, who do you 
think will most experience a health benefit from the study and why? 
•How were patients approached for study participation (in-person 
during planned visit, on the phone, via email, etc.)? 
•What encouraged or motivated patients to participate? What types 
of strategies influenced or affected patient recruitment? 
•What do you think will be the main motivation/value for participating 
in this study?
•What other supports would be necessary to best integrate the study 
into the workflow systems?
We would like to better understand the facilitators and barriers to 
participating in the study.

speak to ____________?
[When the person answers, tell the patient]: This is __________ calling from 
Dr. ______’s office.  Dr. _______ invites you to be part of a national study that 
tests different ways to deal with asthma symptoms in order to reduce asthma 
attacks, emergency room or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], and missed work or school. 
We’re calling patients like you who may be eligible to participate in this 
voluntary study.  Would you like to hear more?”  [If person responds “yes”, 
then continue.  If person responds “no”, please thank them for their time and 
end call].
Our records indicate that you have had an asthma attack in the past year or 
that your asthma may not be fully controlled. Over the [ADDRESS_549495] to enroll.  This can be done virtually or you can 
come into the research office and will take about one hour.  We will review the 
consent form, and if you agree to participate be randomly assigned (like the 
flip of a coin) to one of four study groups. Every participant will be given access 
to online asthma symptom tracking tools called Asthma Symptom Monitoring 
(ASM) that has been shown to help manage asthma symptoms.  The four 
groups are:
oGroup One: only use ASM and continue with your normal asthma 
care.
oGroup Two: use ASM and an antibiotic pi[INVESTIGATOR_433523]. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_433524]. 
oGroup Three: use ASM with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids 
with your rescue medicine – also known as Rescue Inhaled

oGroup Four: use ASM and both an antibiotic pi[INVESTIGATOR_38847] R-ICS.
If you are in a group that adds new medicines or inhalers, you and/or your 
insurance will be responsible for paying for them.  No medications are 
provided by [CONTACT_1758].
Each month during the study you will answer questions about your asthma, 
asthma medication use and how your asthma is affecting you.  These can be 
answered online with a smart phone, with a research staff person over the 
phone, or a computer. The surveys take about [ADDRESS_549496]?

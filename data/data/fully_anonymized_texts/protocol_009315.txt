Eligibility CriteriaThe patient  population will consist of adults diagnosed with 
recurrence of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer following treatment 
with BCG.
Treatment PlanThe study  will have three phases: pre-induction, induction and 
maintenance. Two weeks prior to induction (at week -2), subjects will 
receive the first intravesical instillation of pembrolizumab. During the [ADDRESS_238389] dose of 50 mg. Concomitant 
pembrolizumab will be administered intravesically every two weeks 
for a total of 3 doses (weeks 0, 2, and 4); the starting dose for the first 
cohort will be 1 mg/kg. The maintenance phase starts on week 7 and 
continues up to 1 year (last dose and cystoscopy at week 49). 
Subjects may remain on maintenance treatment up to week [ADDRESS_238390] 12 weeks of maintenance therapy (weeks 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 
and 17 for a total of 6 maintenance doses) and then every 4 weeks 
thereafter (weeks 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49 for a total of 8 doses). 
Dose escalation for cohorts will follow a standard 3+3 escalation 
scheme and the additional dose levels are 1mg/kg, 2mg/kg, 5mg/kg 
and 10mg/kg. BCG dose will remain constant for all patients on all 
dose levels. Intrapatient dose escalation is not allowed in this 
protocol. 
Statistical MethodologyThis is  a phase I dose escalation study using the 3+3 design with 4 
doses. The dose escalation scheme and rules for determining the 
primary outcome, the maximum tolerated dose, are described in 
Section 4.3.  It is expected that up to 24 patients evaluable for dose 
limiting toxicities will be accrued to the study. This 3+3 design has a 
91% chance (49%, 17%) of dose escalating when the true toxicity 
rate for that dose is 10% (30%, 50%).

Protocol Amendment  11 Version Date: November 6, 2020 101 INTRODUCTION – BACKGROUND  & RATIONALE
1.1 Disease Background
In the US, 73,000  patients are diagnosed with bladder cancer each year with 80% of 
tumors classified as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). This group of 
tumors can be restricted to the bladder mucosa (stage Ta or carcinoma in situ [Tis]) 
or invade the lamina propria (i.e., subepi[INVESTIGATOR_70321]; stage T1). They 
are optimally treated with curative intent by [CONTACT_199921] (TUR). However, 
approximately 30-80% of these patients will present with tumor recurrences or 
progression to muscle-invasive disease at five years that contribute to the high 
prevalence of this malignancy 1. In 2011, there were an estimated 571,[ADDRESS_238391] expensive malignancies to manage 3,4. This 
elevated risk of recurrence provided the impetus to develop adjuvant treatments 
following tumor resection with the goals to reduce recurrence and progression to 
muscle-invasive disease. Adjuvant treatments include intravesical instillation of 
bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy and intravesical chemotherapy. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_199880] 6 weekly instillations with BCG followed by 
[CONTACT_43249], 38% of patients still developed recurrence, 7% progressed to muscle-
invasive disease, 5% presented distant metastatic disease, and 3% died from 
bladder cancer 5. Although serious adverse effects occurs in <5% of patients, BCG 
frequently causes cystitis, hematuria, malaise, and fever that results in treatment 
discontinuation in approximately 20% of patients 6. The experience with these side 
effects might also contribute to the dismal adherence of 40% to cystoscopic 
surveillance among NMIBC survivors 7. These results highlight the need to improve 
the outcomes and treatment of patients diagnosed with NMIBC. 
Patients presenting  with recurrences after BCG have limited therapeutic options. 
Radical cystectomy or bladder-preserving strategies are generally recommended 
especially for high-grade recurrent tumors. These surgical options have significant 
long-term morbidity, impact on quality of life and the majority of these patients have 
multiple comorbid conditions (i.e., cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency) 
making them high-risk surgical candidates. It is acceptable to repeat BCG treatment 
for low-grade and selected high-grade tumors especially if the recurrence develops 
more than 1 year after treatment. Limited experience with BCG plus interferon-  
suggests that it can be used for recurrent tumors after 1 or more BCG courses 
resulting in disease free rate of approximately 54-66% at 24 months 8,9. A phase III 
trial compared gemcitabine and mitomycin C for patients with unsuccessful BCG 
treatment 10. Intravesical gemcitabine was better tolerated but 28% of patients still 
developed a recurrence during the 36 months follow up compared to 39% among 
those receiving mitomycin C 10. These results suggest alternative treatments for 
BCG –refractory patients have limited long-term efficacy. Therefore, a radical 
cystectomy and its associated 28% morbidity and 2.5% mortality risks continues to 
offer the highest cure rate in this setting 11.
While the mechanism  of action of BCG is not understood, recognition of the tumor 
by [CONTACT_199922]-tumor response elicited by [CONTACT_176740]. In 
fact, patient inability to mount an immunogenic tumoricidal response when treated 
with BCG has been proposed as one of the mechanisms of recurrences or residual 
disease. This hypothesis might reflect the immune suppression induced by [CONTACT_199923] #: STU00202754-CR0006 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 1/26/2022 through 1/23/2023.

L1). PD-L1 binding to T-cell receptors PD-1 and/or B7-H1 causes immune 
suppression and tumor escape. PD-L1 is expressed by 12% bladder tumor cells and 
by 27% of tumor infiltrating immune cells and up to 50% of tumors that are 
carcinoma in situ 12,13. In addition, 95% of lymphocytes that invade bladder tumors 
express the PD-[ADDRESS_238392], clinically meaningful efficacy of anti-PD-L1 
and anti-PD-1 antibodies has been demonstrated in clinical trials with patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and melanoma 
15,16. In patients that develop BCG-refractory bladder tumors, bladder granuloma 
often over-express PD-L1 after induction of BCG suggesting tumor PD-L1 
expression may dampen the response to BCG 13.
The relevance of PD-[ADDRESS_238393] the PD-L1 (MPDL3280A) in sixty-seven patients with metastatic bladder 
cancer. The treatment was well tolerated among this heavily pretreated patient 
population (79% of patients had received cisplatin and 34% had received 
carboplatin; 48% had undergone cystectomy) including patients with renal 
insufficiency. There were no treatment related grade 4 or 5 adverse events or 
immune-related toxicities. Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in three patients and 
included asthenia, thrombocytopenia and hypophosphatemia. Other frequent grade 
1 and 2 adverse events were decreased appetite, fatigue, and nausea. An overall 
response rate of 55% was documented and included 2 complete responses. There 
was also a higher response rate among patients with tumor-infiltrating immune cells 
positive for PD-L1 by [CONTACT_9064] (43% vs. 11%). Median time to first 
response was [ADDRESS_238394] as a promising therapeutic target in bladder cancer. The 
present study proposes to evaluate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated 
dose of pembrolizumab (a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody with high 
specificity of binding to the PD-1 receptor) when administered intravesically in 
combination with BCG for patients with BCG-refractory non-muscle invasive bladder 
cancer. Pembrolizumab is undergoing clinical development as an intravenous 
immunotherapy for advanced malignancies.   
1.[ADDRESS_238395] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades 17. Accumulating evidence shows a 
correlation between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and 
favorable prognosis in various malignancies 18-22. In particular, the presence of 
CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells 
seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long-term survival in solid 
malignancies such as ovarian, colorectal and pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular 
carcinoma, malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Furthermore, TILs 
can be expanded ex vivo and re-infused, inducing durable objective tumor 
responses in cancers such as melanoma 23,24.

has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement 
of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD-L2) 25,26. The structure of murine PD-1 has been 
resolved 21. PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins 
containing an Ig Variable-type (V-type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a 
cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The 
cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM). Following T-cell stimulation, PD-[ADDRESS_238397] from that of CTLA-4 as both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_199881] 30,31. 
PD-1 was  shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral 
CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B-cells, Tregs and Natural Killer cells 32,33. Expression has 
also been shown during thymic development on CD4-CD8- (double negative) T-cells 
as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells 22. The ligands for PD-1 (PD-
L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell 
types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors including 
bladder carcinoma 30,34-38. Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors 
containing both IgV- and IgC-like domains in the extracellular region and contain 
short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs. Binding of either PD-[ADDRESS_238398] notably on 
vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on 
antigen-presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory 
environments. PD-L2 is thought to control immune T-cell activation in lymphoid 
organs, whereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral 
tissues 34. Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of cancers 
were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T-cell inhibitor. High 
expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (and to a lesser extent of PD-L2) has been 
found to correlate with poor prognosis and survival in various cancer types, 
including RCC 39, pancreatic carcinoma 40, hepatocellular carcinoma 41, ovarian 
carcinoma 42, and localized bladder carcinoma 37,38. The observed correlation of 
clinical prognosis with PD-L1 expression in multiple cancers suggests that the PD-
1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be 
considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
Studies in  mouse models have shown that administration of antibodies blocking PD-
1/PD-L1 interaction enhances infiltration of tumor-specific CD8+ T-cells and leads 
ultimately to tumor rejection, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other 
treatment modalities. Anti-mouse PD-[ADDRESS_238399] effectively promoted CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumor and 
the presence of IFN-, granzyme B and perforin, indicating that the mechanism of 
action involved local infiltration and activation of effector T-cell function in vivo 40,43-
47. In addition, the combination of gemcitabine and anti-PD-L1 mAb therapy 
demonstrated synergy in the reduction of pancreatic mouse tumors 40.

and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W), in subjects with 
advanced solid tumors. All three dose levels were well tolerated and no 
dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Based on PK data showing a half-life 
of 21 days, the protocol was amended to change the dosing frequency in 
the expansion cohort to every 3 weeks (Q3W). Two subjects with melanoma 
from the initial cohort of subjects treated in Protocol [ADDRESS_238400] 1.1. The ongoing expansion cohort

anti-cancer activity has been observed (37% objective responses; 44% best 
objective response by [CONTACT_393] 1.1). Of further note, those patients with 
melanoma who were treated with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W had a best 
objective response rate of 56% by [CONTACT_393] 1.1, and those treated at 10

patients were randomized between the two treatment schedules. Amongst 
approximately [ADDRESS_238401] common drug-related adverse 
events (AEs) included fatigue, rash, pruritus, diarrhea, and arthralgia. The 
incidence of Grade 3-5 AEs was 27%. Potentially immune-related AEs have 
been observed, including pneumonitis in both the melanoma and NSCLC 
cohorts. Although most cases do not result in death, in one instance, a 96-
year old man with melanoma who experienced Grade 2 
pneumonia/pneumonitis suffered a fatal myocardial infarction while being 
treated for the pneumonia/pneumonitis.
Pembrolizumab Protocol 001  (PN001) Part C enrolled 38 subjects with 
NSCLC who experienced progression of cancer after initiation of their 
second line of systemic therapy to receive monotherapy pembrolizumab. 
The preliminary objective response rate was 24% by [CONTACT_199925]-related response criteria (irRC). Clinical responses have been 
observed in subjects with adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and 
large cell carcinoma when assessed by [CONTACT_19104]. The median duration of 
treatment amongst responders is a minimum of [ADDRESS_238402] responders 
continue on therapy. Subjects were required to submit a newly obtained 
tumor biopsy prior to initiating therapy with pembrolizumab to evaluate the 
tumors for expression of PD-L1, the presumptive predictive biomarker of 
pembrolizumab, using an immunohistochemistry assay. A modified H-score 
scoring system of PD-L1 expression was established for NSCLC by 
[CONTACT_165886]. This scoring 
system was then applied to the samples from PN001 Part C. A total of 35 
patients from PN001 had tumor samples evaluable and a clinical response 
assessed. All but 3 patients were from Part C; 3 patients from Part A had 
NSCLC, submitted tumor tissue, and had a clinical response assessment. 
Seven of the 35 patients had a clinical response (20%) by [CONTACT_199926]. Six responders (26%) were observed amongst the twenty-
three patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1. Of note, these six 
responders clustered at the higher end of the modified H-score. Six of nine 
(67%) patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 to an extent above the 
preliminary cut point had a clinical response. Only one response was noted 
amongst the twelve patients whose tumors did not express PD-L1. Given 
these results, the use of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker is being further 
explored in subsequent NSCLC studies.
The combined effect of  BCG and pembrolizumab may increase the urgency 
and frequency of BCG, resulting in systemic steroid administration which

such local side effects are usually treated with anti-cholinergic medication 
rather than systemic steroids. BCG-sepsis occurs at a rate of 0.4% when 
given without PD-[ADDRESS_238403] seen a 17X increase in 
immune cells infiltrating the bladder of mice receiving the bladder cancer 
carcinogen BBN.  These immune cells (CD45+) are primary localized to the 
bladder, confirming that local delivery of the PD-[ADDRESS_238404] for NMIBC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Our trial is unique providing intravesical delivery. While we 
have no pre-clinical data demonstrating increased bio-delivery, multiple 
other antibody based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_199882].  These 
monoclonal antibodies bind the bladder epi[INVESTIGATOR_199883]58, 59, 61. The benefit of this approach is reduced exposure to potential 
systemic administration. While these medications have been well-tolerated, 
the NMIBC population has only localized, superficial disease and long-term 
side effects of intravenous checkpoint inhibitors are unknown.
1.3 Rationale  for the Current Study
1.3.1 Rationale  for testing pembrolizumab in non-muscle invasive bladder 
cancer
To date,  immune modulation regimens for patients with BCG-refractory 
NMIBC are restricted to the addition of intravesical interferon- to BCG with 
limited efficacy. No studies have addressed the safety or efficacy of a 
monoclonal antibody against PD-1 given intravesically. The intravesical 
delivery of pembrolizumab has the advantage of greater exposure of 
bladder tissue to the drug that can possibly enhance its efficacy while 
minimizing systemic side effects including fatigue, diarrhea, decreased 
appetite, pruritus and nausea. On the other hand, the low permeability of 
the urothelium might represent a limitation to the intravesical delivery. The 
urothelium is unlikely to be permeable to the drug as the chemotherapeutic 
mitomycin c (which is used as standard of care by [CONTACT_199927]) has a molecular weight of 54 kd and the 
drug has a molecular weight of 146 kd. However, the inflammation induced 
by [CONTACT_199928] 48. Therefore, the main goal of the present phase I 
dose-escalation study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
pembrolizumab that can be given intravesically in combination with BCG for 
patients with BCG-refractory NMIBC (up to the individual maximum 
tolerated dosages of each drug). Secondary goals include describing the 
dose limiting toxicities and assessing safety of the combination of 
pembrolizumab and BCG. The determination of the pembrolizumab MTD 
will be critical to design future trials to investigate the efficacy of this novel 
treatment for patients with BCG-refractory NMIBC.

NU Study Number: NU  15U06
[COMPANY_006] Study  Number: 3475-265
Protocol Amendment  11 Version Date: November 6, 2020 15Several lines  of evidence documenting the immune dysfunction associated 
with bladder cancer supports the hypothesis that immunotherapy can alter 
the process of carcinogenesis. Earlier studies investigating the 
immunological profile of patients with bladder cancer showed significant 
impairment of lymphocytes function and a predominance of T-regulatory 
cells and Th1 inhibitory cytokines in the tumor environment, some of the 
immune dysfunction was reversed after cystectomy 49,50.  The number of 
CD8 tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes is correlated with bladder cancer-
specific survival supports the critical role of immune response on this 
disease. One of the critical mediators of immune response is the B7 family 
of immune co-regulatory proteins (B7-H1 or PD-L1, B7-H3, PD-1), which 
have been demonstrated to result in immune evasion of urothelial cancer 51. 
B7 homolog 3 (B7-H3) molecule displays higher expression in bladder 
cancer cells compared to normal urothelium (70% vs. 20%) irrespective of 
tumor stage suggesting its involvement in early stages of carcinogenesis 37. 
Expression of PD-1 in infiltrating lymphocytes and its ligand B7-H1 (also 
known as PD-1 ligand 1) in tumor cells were associated with advanced 
tumor stage. Urothelial expression of PD-L1 was also predictive of mortality 
following cystectomy in patients with organ-limited disease (i.e., pTa, pT1, 
CIS, pT2Nx/N0M0). Relevant to the current protocol, patients previously 
treated with BCG showed a distinct profile of T-cell co-regulators expression 
at cystectomy. These tumors showed reduced expression of PD-L1 and 
increased expression of B7-H3 and PD-[ADDRESS_238405] PD-1 
(pembrolizumab). 
1.3.[ADDRESS_238406]  in human  study (Protocol  number 001, refer to IB), which 
treated a variety of tumor types,  pembrolizumab showed  evidence of 
target engagement and objective evidence  of tumor size reduction at all 
dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). No DLT was 
observed and no MTD reached at these dose levels. Dose level 10 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks was evaluated in previously treated patients with NSCLC in 
Part C of Protocol 001. Pembrolizumab has also shown signs of efficacy 
and acceptable PK and PD results when administered both every 2 weeks 
and every 3 weeks. PK  data analysis of pembrolizumab administered 
intravenously every 2 weeks showed  slow systemic clearance,  limited  
volume of distribution, and a long half-life (refer to IB). 
Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2  release assay) suggested that peripheral 
target engagement  is durable (>21 days).  Previously  treated patients with 
NSCLC in PN001 Part  C have experienced durable  objective  responses 
with acceptable toxicity  when treated with pembrolizumab at 10 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks.  Preliminary data in patients with melanoma and NSCLC 
demonstrates objective  responses  by [CONTACT_199929] 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks dose and schedule. These results document 
efficacy results with both 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses. The additional dose 
level of 1 mg/kg was selected based on efficacy estimated by [CONTACT_31577]-PD 
modeling studies (discussed below) and concerns with safety given multiple 
intravesical administrations.  
A syngeneic  mouse tumor  efficacy experiment,  that included PK sampling 
and tissue  receptor occupancy was conducted with a surrogate antibody 
and analyzed by [CONTACT_199930]-PD modeling. Results were 
extrapolated to man with inclusion of human relevant  parameters  for 
PK, pembrolizumab binding properties to PD-1 and the FcRN  receptor, and

Protocol Amendment  11 Version Date: November 6, [ADDRESS_238407] dose of pembrolizumab with the potential  to be equivalent to 10 
mg/kg of pembrolizumab was 1-2 mg/kg. Considering the lack of clinical 
experience with intravesical administration of pembrolizumab and the need 
for multiple administrations, the dose 1 mg/kg was selected as the start 
dose in this study and will be used in first cohort of three evaluable subjects. 
Additional dose levels will include 2 mg/kg and 10mg/kg (see details of 
doses escalation on Section 4.3). 
Because of uncertainty  as to  which dose schedule will have the better  
efficacy and safety  profile in patients with BCG-refractory NMIBC,  two 
dosing intervals of pembrolizumab will be utilized in this trial, every 2 
weeks during induction therapy until week 17 (first cystoscopy) and every 6 
weeks for the remaining period of maintenance phase (weeks 23, 29, 35, 41, 
47). The shorter interval during induction therapy is based on the hypothesis 
that maximizing the PD-[ADDRESS_238408]. 
There is  a possibility of adding an expansion cohort of up to 10 subjects to 
further define safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab. This will be determined 
by [CONTACT_199931].
1.3.3 Rationale  for Exploratory Studies 
Pembrolizumab has  been shown to modulate the levels of several cytokines 
during studies using cultured blood cells from healthy donors, cancer 
patients, and primates (refer  to IB). The correlative studies on this trial will 
explore humoral and cellular responses to pembrolizumab and BCG 
treatments by [CONTACT_199932] (i.e., IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, IFN 
and TNF-) in urine and serum samples and analyzing peripheral blood 
lymphocyte phenotypes. 
Prior experiments  with tumor response to BCG suggested that up-regulation 
of Th1 cytokines (i.e., IFN, IL-2, IL-12) is associated with BCG response 
and increased levels of Th2 cytokines (i.e., IL-6 and IL-10) correlate with 
recurrence 53-55. Induction of IL-2 mRNA in peripheral-blood mononuclear 
cells also predicted antitumor response during BCG treatment of non-
muscle invasive bladder cancer. Urinary IL-2 measured 6 and 8 hrs after 
BCG administration correlated with higher risk of recurrence, whereas 
urinary IL-10 and IFN did not present significant correlation with BCG 
failure 55. Therefore, correlative studies will evaluate the profile of cytokine 
production in urine and serum samples of patients receiving BCG and 
pembrolizumab and correlate with toxicity and risk of progression of non-
muscle invasive bladder cancer. Peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotype 
determination by [CONTACT_199933]/or toxicity.
Tumor specimens  collected prior to study entry and those obtained during 
the study will be tested for the expression of PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 and 
profile of immune cell infiltration by [CONTACT_9064]. This analysis will 
evaluate the effect of treatment on tumor expression of these molecules and 
to explore possible correlations with toxicity and risk of recurrence. Clinical 
studies with anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies have suggested a 
correlation between clinical response and expression of PD-L1 in tumors 
15,56. QualTek has developed and validated a PD-L1 IHC assay using 
IRB #: STU00202754-CR0006 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 1/26/2022 through 1/23/2023.

2 OBJECTIVES &  ENDPOINTS
2.1 Primary  Objective & Endpoint
The primary  objective of this phase I dose-escalation study will be to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the study drug (pembrolizumab) when 
administered intravesically in combination with BCG in patients with high risk or 
BCG-refractory non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (up to the individual maximum 
tolerated dose of each drug alone). The MTD will be defined as the highest dose 
that causes dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in <2 of 6 patients.
2.2 Secondary  Objectives & Endpoints
Secondary objectives  and endpoints will include the following:
2.2.1 To  describe the DLTs of pembrolizumab in combination with BCG in this 
population. DLTs will be defined as described in Section 4.3.1 and the 
period for assessing DLTs will be during the 2 week pre-induction phase 
and the seven weeks of induction phase.
2.2.2 To  assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab 
and BCG in subjects with high risk or BCG-refractory non-muscle-invasive 
bladder cancer. The number, frequency, and severity of adverse events (as 
defined by [CONTACT_199936] v 4.03) will be recorded.
2.3 Exploratory Objectives  & Endpoints
2.3.1 To  characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pembrolizumab in both blood 
and urine when administered intravesically in combination with BCG. This 
will be  done on the first 3 patients only to provide exploratory data. (A 
limited amount  of plasma PK testing may be performed on additional 
patients as described below.*) PK will be evaluated by [CONTACT_199937] 
(described in Section 5) during weeks -2 and 4 for determination of plasma 
and urine concentration-time profiles and PK parameters of pembrolizumab. 
Blood PKs will be performed by [CONTACT_199938]; urine will be collected 
and stored in the Meeks Lab for later analysis.
*A portion  of the blood specimens that have been collected for cytokine 
analysis (time-points week -2, week 0, and week 17) may be used in 
plasma PK assays, per Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9106].
2.3.2 To  measure humoral and cellular responses to tumor antigens on serum 
and urine samples by [CONTACT_199939] (i.e., IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, 
IL-10, IL-18, IFN and TNF- ) and peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotype 
throughout treatment. Urine and blood samples will be collected before and

this population assessed when patient undergoes cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (weeks 17, 
25, 33, 41, and 49 if applicable). Patients will be examined via bladder 
cystoscopy and may undergo biopsy for pathological confirmation if needed. 
Responses will be categorized as yes or no for bladder recurrence.
2.3.4 To  document the progression rate associated with the combination of 
intravesical pembrolizumab and BCG in patients with high risk or BCG-
refractory non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Tumor progression will be 
defined as positive transurethral resection and/or biopsy. 
2.3.5 To  evaluate the relationship between tumor biomarkers PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-
1 as defined by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) and adverse effects and 
recurrence rate. This evaluation will be performed on archived tissue 
samples obtained at baseline and on fresh tissue from any subsequent

Protocol Amendment  11 Version Date: November 6, 2020 2449. If  ambulatory cystoscopy reveals any abnormal finding requiring further 
investigation, BCG and/or pembrolizumab administration will be suspended until 
clinical investigation is completed. Tumor progression will be defined as positive 
transurethral resection and/or biopsy including tumor stage progression, muscle 
infiltration or metastasis. Should a bladder cancer progression be confirmed, the 
subject will be off treatment and off-study. Otherwise, subject will be able to resume 
study treatments approximately 4 weeks (per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]) after any bladder biopsy 
to allow appropriate healing. NOTE: the PI [INVESTIGATOR_199887]. Any patient who has a high-
risk lesion resected on a follow-up cystoscopy must be removed from study 
treatment. 
This phase  I study will utilize a 3+3 dose escalation scheme for the study drug 
pembrolizumab with an initial dose of 1 mg/kg given intravesically to the first cohort 
of three subjects. Details regarding dose escalation can be found in section 4.3. 
This study will enroll a maximum of [ADDRESS_238441] one dose of the study drug. Evaluable 
subjects for response are those who meet the minimum treatment and safety 
evaluation requirements of the study: i. the subject has received the six doses of 
BCG and three doses of pembrolizumab planned for the induction phase and has 
sufficient safety data available to assess the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities; ii. 
the subject has received at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab out of the total 11 doses 
planned during the maintenance period.
There is  a possibility of adding an expansion cohort of up to 10 subjects to further 
define safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab. This will be determined by [CONTACT_199943].

^ Treatments  should occur +/- 2 days from the same day each week.
4.2.1 BCG  
BCG will  be administered weekly during the Induction phase of treatment, 
followed by [CONTACT_199944] (see duration of therapy; section 4.8). Every 
effort should be made to administer treatments on the same day each week, 
however a window of +/- [ADDRESS_238442] of 50mg BCG (TICE® BCG) diluted 
in 50ml of sterile normal saline that will be injected into the bladder through 
sterile urethral catheterization. There will be no dose escalation planned for 
BCG, however the dose may be reduced based on toxicity criteria in section 
4.4. After emptying the bladder, the BCG solution will be injected 
intravesically over 1 or 2 minutes and retained for 2 hours. Following the 
administration, patients will receive instructions to drink large amounts of 
fluids and monitor for symptoms that can develop and be related to the BCG 
instillation: dysuria, urgency, frequency, hematuria, persistent fever 
(temperature above 101oF for more than 2 days), chills, night sweats, 
malaise, arthralgia, cough, or skin rash. 
4.2.2 Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab treatment will  start two weeks prior to BCG administration 
(week -2). Patients will receive three instillations of pembrolizumab 
concomitant with BCG (weeks 0, 2, and 4; induction period), followed by 
[CONTACT_199945] (see duration of therapy; section 4.7). The 
dose that subjects receive will depend upon the cohort to which they are 
enrolled; the starting dose will be 1 mg/kg. Each pembrolizumab dose will 
be diluted in 50ml of sterile normal saline and injected into the bladder 
through sterile urethral catheterization during 1 or 2 minutes and retained 
for 2 hours. During the days that BCG and pembrolizumab are given 
concomitantly, BCG will be administered and immediately followed by 
[CONTACT_199946]; each medication will be diluted in 50ml and 
the total volume of 100ml will be retained for 2 hours. If pembrolizumab 
administration is scheduled on the same day as the cystoscopy (weeks 17,

provided no abnormal findings were noted.
4.3 Dose  Escalation Scheme
There will  be no dose escalation for BCG (patients on all cohorts will receive the 
same dose). The table below summarizes the pembrolizumab dose levels; subjects 
will receive the same dose of pembrolizumab during pre-induction, induction and 
maintenance phases. No dose reductions are permitted for pembrolizumab. BCG 
may be reduced for toxicity as described in section 4.4. A standard “3+3” dose 
escalation design will be utilized. Initially, the study will enroll 3 subjects at the 
starting dose (level 1), after which enrollment will be temporarily suspended until all 
3 patients complete the DLT evaluation period (defined as the 2 week pre-induction 
phase and the seven weeks of induction phase). Once all 3 subjects complete the 
DLT period and toxicity data has been reviewed by [CONTACT_199947], a decision will be made to proceed with escalation 
accordingly the rules below. 
Table 4-2: Escalation  Dose Levels
Dose Level Pembrolizumab BCG Number of  patients
1 1 mg/kg 50mg 3-6
2 2 mg/kg 50mg 3-6
3 5 mg/kg 50mg 3-6
4 10 mg/kg 50mg 3-6
The following  rules will be used at each dose level to determine whether or not to 
proceed to the next dose level:
If  0 of 3 subjects at a given dose level experience a DLT (defined below), 
then escalation will proceed to the next dose level.
If  [ADDRESS_238443] occur:
oIf  this happens at level 1, the study will be closed to further accrual 
and the regimen of pembrolizumab + BCG will be considered too 
toxic at any dose.
oIf  this happens at level 2 or beyond, the previous level will be 
declared the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
If  1 of 3 subjects at a given dose level experiences a DLT, then an 
additional 3 slots will be added (for a total of 6 patients at that level):
oIf  1 of 6 total experiences a DLT, then escalation will proceed to the 
next level.
oIf  ≥ 2 of 6 total experience a DLT, the previous level will be declared 
the MTD. 
NOTE: Whichever  dose level is declared the MTD must have 6 total subjects treated 
at that level. For example, if 3 subjects are treated at level 2 and 0 subjects 
experience DLT, escalation would then proceed to level 3. However, if ≥ 2 subjects 
at level 3 experience DLT, enrollment to level 2 would need to be re-opened to 
enroll an additional 3 subjects at that level (with 0 or 1 DLT observed in 6 total 
subjects) in order to declare level 2 the MTD. If dose level 3 is achieved without 
MTD-defining DLT, dose level 3 will be considered the recommended phase II dose 
for future trials. 
4.3.1 Definitions
DLT is  defined as a significant adverse events (detailed below) occurring 
during the DLT observation period (consisting of the 2 week pre-induction 
phase and the 7 weeks of induction phase) that is related to either drug or

4.4 Dose  Delays/Modifications
Symptoms of  local toxicity will be monitored throughout treatment. Treatment will be 
delayed for up to 2 weeks (14 days) if grade 2 local toxicity (not considered DLT) 
develops during pre-induction, induction, or maintenance phases. In addition, BCG 
dose modifications will be managed according to standard of care procedures; 
specifically, in the case of a grade 2 local bladder toxicity, the dose should be 
delayed, and BCG may be re-challenged at half the dose (25mg) per the treating 
physician’s discretion within 2 weeks (14 days) of the last administration. Local 
toxicities related to the treatment with BCG and/or pembrolizumab include bladder 
spasm, cystitis noninfective, hematuria, urinary frequency, urinary retention, urinary 
tract pain, urgency. In addition, for grade [ADDRESS_238444] infection, 
treatment may be delayed  up to 2 weeks at the discretion of the treating physician; 
for grade [ADDRESS_238445] infection, antibiotics are allowed with a 2 week 
delay of treatment as long as the infection has been cleared symptomatically. 
Treatment may resume when the toxicity resolves or improves to grade 1. If toxicity 
does not resolve to Grade 0-1 within 2 weeks (14 days) after scheduled dose, trial 
treatment should be discontinued after consultation with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_199889]. 
The patients will  be allowed to delay treatment during induction or maintenance by 
[CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks (14 days) due to scheduling difficulties. When BCG is delayed due to 
local bladder toxicities, pembrolizumab will be delayed as well.   Doses of 
pembrolizumab will not be reduced due to toxicities. BCG doses may be reduced 
following standard of care as described above. If the patient needs to undergo a 
transurethral biopsy or resection during the study, there will be a delay of 
approximately 4 weeks (per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]) until the next treatment of BCG or 
pembrolizumab to allow healing of biopsy/resection site. 
In addition,  pembrolizumab will be withheld for drug-related Grade 4 hematologic 
toxicities, non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 including laboratory abnormalities, 
and severe or life-threatening AEs. Delay by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks (14 days) is permitted. 
Treatment may resume when the toxicity resolves or improves to grade 1. If toxicity 
does not resolve to Grade 0-1 within 2 weeks (14 days) after the scheduled dose

4.5.1 Immune-Related  Adverse Events
The limited  systemic absorption of chemotherapy agents and cytokines (i.e., 
IFN) when administered intravesically predicts that immune-related adverse 
events (irAEs) observed in patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab 
will be rare. Nevertheless, all measures will be in place for careful

4.5.2 Management  of Specific Adverse Events
In addition  to the table above, subjects should receive appropriate 
supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_3966]:
Anti-infectives:  Subjects with a documented infectious complication 
should receive oral or IV antibiotics or other anti-infective agents as 
considered appropriate by [CONTACT_199948] a given infectious 
condition, according to standard institutional practice. Please refer to 
section 4.4 for guidance regarding delay of treatment up to 2 weeks (14 
days) for local, treatment-related, bladder and urinary tract infections. 
Management  of Infusion Reactions: NOTE: intravenous infusion is no 
the route of administration that will be employed in this protocol. The 
risk of these reactions is relevant with intravenous administration of 
pembrolizumab and it is not expected to be clinically significant with 
intravesical administration. However, all measures will be in place for 
careful monitoring and management should these occur. Acute infusion 
reactions (which can include cytokine release syndrome, angioedema, 
or anaphylaxis) are different from allergic/hypersensitive reactions, 
although some of the manifestations are common to both AEs. Signs 
and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and 
generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. 
Signs/symptoms may include: Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity 
(including drug fever); Arthralgia (joint pain); Bronchospasm; Cough; 
Dizziness; Dyspnea (shortness of breath); Fatigue (asthenia, lethargy, 
malaise); Headache; Hypertension; Hypotension; Myalgia (muscle 
pain); Nausea; Pruritis/itching; Rash/desquamation; Rigors/chills; 
Sweating (diaphoresis); Tachycardia; Tumor pain (onset or 
exacerbation of tumor pain due to treatment); Urticaria (hives, welts, 
wheals); Vomiting.

Immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs)
Events of  clinical interest of a potential immunologic etiology (irECIs) may 
be defined as an adverse event of unknown etiology, associated with drug 
exposure and is consistent with an immune phenomenon.  irAEs may be 
predicted based on the nature of the pembrolizumab compound, its 
mechanism of action, and reported experience with immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_199894] a similar mechanism of action. Special attention should be paid to AEs 
that may be suggestive of potential irAEs.  An irAE can occur shortly after 
the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment.  
If an  irAE is suspected, efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, 
infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic causes prior to labeling an 
adverse event as an irAE.  Information on how to identify and evaluate 
irAEs has been developed and is included in the Event of Clinical Interest 
and Immune-Related Adverse Event Guidance Document located in the 
Administrative Binder.  Subjects who develop a Grade 2 or higher irAE

[IP_ADDRESS] Severe  skin reactions
Immune-mediated severe  skin reactions have been reported in 
patients treated with pembrolizumab. Monitor patients for suspected 
severe skin reactions and exclude other causes. Based on the 
severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently 
discontinue pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids

patients treated with pembrolizumab. For signs or symptoms of SJS 
or TEN, withhold pembrolizumab and refer the patient for 
specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is 
confirmed, permanently discontinue pembrolizumab.
[IP_ADDRESS] Other  Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
The following  additional clinically significant, immune-mediated 
adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients treated 
with pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-
006, and KEYNOTE-010: uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré 
syndrome, and pancreatitis. The following was reported in other 
clinical studies with pembrolizumab or in post-marketing use: 
myocarditis. 
Cases of these  immune-mediated adverse reactions, some of which 
were severe, have been reported in clinical trials or in post-
marketing use.
Solid organ  transplant rejection has been reported in the post-

Protocol Amendment  11 Version Date: November 6, 2020 364.6 Concomitant Medications/Treatments
Medications or  vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not 
allowed during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or 
other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, 
discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  The investigator 
should discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor.  The final decision on 
any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's 
primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the subject on trial therapy or 
vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the Investigator, the 
Sponsor, and the subject.

welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_199895].  All concomitant medication 
will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, 
over-the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  
If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, 
frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF.
All concomitant  medications received within [ADDRESS_238455] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs. 
4.6.2 Prohibited  Concomitant Medications
Subjects are  prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_199896]:
Anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy  or biological therapy 
Anti-cancer immunotherapy  not specified in this protocol
Chemotherapy  not specified in this protocol
Investigational  agents other than pembrolizumab
Radiation  therapy  
Live  vaccines within 4 weeks prior to study registration and while 
participating in the trial.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not 
limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow 
fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza 
vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are 
allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-Mist®) are live 
attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed at any time during the study. 
Glucocorticoids  for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from 
an event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology. 
However, patients are allowed to use bronchodilators or local steroid 
injections if clinically necessary. 
Subjects who, in the  assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any 
of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be 
removed from the trial.  Subjects may receive other medications that the 
investigator deems to be medically necessary.

cystoscope is placed via urethra into the bladder. The entire urothelium is inspected 
(including the prostate in men). Retroflexion of the scope is performed to evaluate 
the base of the bladder. The bladder is then barbatoged with 60 cc of normal saline 
for cytology. The scope is removed. 
4.8 Duration  of Therapy
The study  therapy will include a 2 week pre-induction phase, 6 week induction 
phase, followed by [CONTACT_199950] 1 year (last dose 
at week 47) or until:
Disease  progression
Inter-current  illness that prevents further administration of treatment
Resection  of a high risk lesion during a study cystoscopy
Unacceptable  adverse event(s)
Patient  decides to withdraw from treatment or the study as a whole
General  or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.
4.9 Duration  of Follow Up
4.9.1 Safety  Follow-Up Visit
The end-of-treatment visit  will be conducted approximately 30 days (± 7 
days) after the last dose of trial treatment, OR at the time of the week 53 
cystoscopy (if the patient completes all of the maintenance phase), OR 
before the initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment, whichever comes first. 
All AEs that occur prior to this visit should be recorded. Subjects with an AE 
of Grade > [ADDRESS_238456] dose of trial therapy, follow patients:
Every  3 months (± 30 days) during years 1 and 2;

This study  will be conducted in compliance with the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) of the 
Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. The level of risk 
attributed to this study requires High Intensity Monitoring, as outlined in the DSMP . In addition, the 
study will  abide by [CONTACT_199953], as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations.  
6.[ADDRESS_238463] a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically 
significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that 
is temporally associated with the use of the [COMPANY_006]’s product, is also an adverse event.
Changes resulting from  normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events. 
Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_199900] a physiologically 
appropriate time.
[COMPANY_006] product  includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, 
diagnostic agent or protocol-specified procedure, whether investigational (including 
placebo or active comparator medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, 
provided by [CONTACT_199954].
Adverse events  may occur during the course of the use of [COMPANY_006] product in clinical trials 
or within the follow-up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, 
from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.
Adverse events  may also occur in screened subjects during any pre-allocation baseline 
period as a result of a protocol-specified intervention, including washout or 
discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.
All adverse  events will be recorded from the time the consent form is signed through 30 
days following cessation of treatment and at each examination on the Adverse Event 
case report forms/worksheets. The reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any 
serious criteria is described in section 6.3.
Adverse events  will not be collected for subjects during the pre-screening period (for 
determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any 
protocol-specified procedure or intervention. If the subject requires a blood draw, fresh 
tumor biopsy etc., the subject is first required to provide consent to the main study and 
AEs will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.
6.2 Severity  of Adverse Events
All adverse  events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. The CTCAE v4 is available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
If no  CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as follows:
Mild  (grade 1): the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily 
activities.

Protocol Amendment  11 Version Date: November 6, 2020 43Moderate  (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily activities.
Severe (grade  3): the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily 
activities or  significantly affects his/her clinical status.
Life-threatening  (grade 4): the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event.
Fatal (grade  5): the event caused death.
6.[ADDRESS_238464] medical occurrence that:
Results  in death.
If death  results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.
Is  life-threatening.
The patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to 
an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
Requires  in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9959] ≥ 24 hours.
Results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
Is  a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Is  associated with an overdose.
For purposes  of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose 
exceeding the prescribed dose for pembrolizumab by 20% over the 
prescribed dose. No specific information is available on the treatment of 
overdose of pembrolizumab. In the event of overdose, pembrolizumab 
should be discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for signs 
of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically 
indicated.
If an  adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a 
[COMPANY_006] product, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, 
even if no other seriousness criteria are met.
If a dose  of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is 
taken without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory 
results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest 
(ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without 
adverse effect.”
All reports  of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported 
within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days hours to [COMPANY_006] 
Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX [PHONE_1840])
Is  an important medical event.
Any event  that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment of 
the investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be considered for reporting as 
a serious adverse event. The event may require medical or surgical

[COMPANY_006] Study  Number: 3475-265
Protocol Amendment  11 Version Date: November 6, [ADDRESS_238471]  vials of BCG should be stored refrigerated, at 2-8°C (36-46°F). This 
agent contains live bacteria and should be protected from direct sunlight. The 
product should not be used after the expi[INVESTIGATOR_199904].
7.2.4 Protocol  dose: 
Each BCG dose  will consist of 50mg BCG (TICE® BCG) diluted in 50ml of 
sterile normal saline that will be injected into the bladder through sterile urethral 
catheterization. Refer to package insert for detailed reconstitution and 
preparation procedures.
7.2.5 Preparation:  
The preparation  of the BCG suspension should be done using aseptic 
technique. To avoid cross-contamination, parenteral drugs should not be 
prepared in areas where BCG has been prepared. A separate area for the 
preparation of the BCG suspension is recommended. All equipment, supplies, 
and receptacles in contact [CONTACT_199959]. The pharmacist or individual responsible for mixing the agents 
should wear gloves and take precautions to avoid contact [CONTACT_199960]. If preparation cannot be performed in a biocontainment hood, then a mask 
and gown should be worn to avoid inhalation of BCG organisms and inadvertent 
exposure to broken skin.
Option 1  (Using Syringe method): Draw 1 mL of sterile, preservative-free saline 
(0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP) at 4-25°C into a small syringe (e.g., 3 
mL) and add to 1 vial of BCG to resuspend. Gently swirl the vial until a 
homogenous suspension is obtained. Avoid forceful agitation which may cause 
clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_199905]. Dispense the cloudy BCG suspension into the top 
end of a syringe (per institutional guideline) which contains 49 mL of saline 
diluent, bringing the total volume to 50 mL. To mix, gently rotate the syringe.
Option 2  (Using Reconstitution Accessories):
Reconstitution Accessories  may be provided with each BCG product order. 
Please refer to the Reconstitution Accessories Instructions provided with the 
accessories for a full description of the product reconstitution procedures using 
these accessories. The reconstituted BCG should be kept refrigerated (2-8°C), 
protected from exposure to direct sunlight, and used within 2 hours. Unused 
solution should be discarded after 2 hours.
Note: DO  NOT filter the contents of the BCG vial. Precautions should be taken 
to avoid exposing the BCG to direct sunlight. Bacteriostatic solutions must be 
avoided. In addition, use only sterile, preservative-free saline, 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection USP as diluent.

Protocol Amendment  11 Version Date: November 6, [ADDRESS_238473] consistent with an immunological 
mechanism. There is no evidence that dose reduction or antituberculous drug 
therapy can prevent or lessen the irritative toxicity of BCG.
“Flu-like” symptoms (malaise,  fever, and chills) which may accompany the 
localized, irritative toxicities often reflect hypersensitivity reactions which can be 
treated symptomatically. Antihistamines have also been used.
Adverse reactions  to BCG tend to be progressive in frequency and severity with 
subsequent instillation. Delay or postponement of subsequent treatment may or 
may not reduce the severity of a reaction during subsequent instillation.
Although uncommon,  serious infectious complications of intravesical BCG have 
been reported. The most serious infectious complication of BCG is disseminated 
sepsis with associated mortality. In addition, M. bovis infections have been 
reported in lung, liver, bone, bone marrow, kidney, regional lymph nodes, and 
prostate in patients who have received intravesical BCG. Some male 
genitourinary tract infections (orchitis/epi[INVESTIGATOR_95541]) have been resistant to 
multiple-drug antituberculous therapy and required orchiectomy.
If a patient develops  persistent fever or experiences an acute febrile illness 
consistent with BCG infection, BCG treatment should be discontinued and the 
patient immediately evaluated and treated for systemic infection (see 
WARNINGS).

8.2 Tissue  Immunohistochemistry Studies
8.2.1 Tissue  Procurement 
Tumor samples  will be requested from all patients. A formalin fixed paraffin 
embedded tumor tissue sample (or newly obtained formalin fixed biopsy of a 
tumor lesion not previously irradiated) will be procured in the form of at least five 
unstained slides. Cytologic specimens will not be acceptable. If additional 
biopsies are performed during scheduled cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_199899], an 
additional 5 unstained slides from each will also be obtained for IHC studies only 
if the sample contains tumor tissue. See separate lab manual for details on 
processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
8.2.2 Assay  Methodology
Briefly, paraffin-embedded  tumor specimens will be deparaffinized in xylene and 
rehydrated in a graded series of alcohols. Slides will be unmasked in Target 
Retrieval Solution (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) using a Decloaking 
Chamber (Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, Calif) and then blocked for 
endogenous peroxidase for 5 minutes with a peroxidase blocking solution. 
Slides will be rinsed in TRIS-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST), 
incubated for 30 minutes with 1.5% normal horse serum in TBST, rinsed in 
TBST, and blocked for endogenous avidin and biotin. Slides will then be 
incubated overnight at 48C with an anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-L2 
antibodies (BD Biosciences). Tissue slides will be incubated with respective 
antibodies at a concentration of 1:100. This step will be followed by 30 minutes 
of incubation with biotinylated horse antimouse IgG and avidin/biotin complex 
reagent. Slides will be amplified using a Tyramide Signal Amplification Biotin 
System (Perkin-Elmer, [LOCATION_011], Mass) and incubated in 3-amino-9-
ethylcarbazole chromogen. Isotype-matched antibodies were used to control for 
nonspecific staining. 
Hematoxylin/eosin and  PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2-stained sections will be 
reviewed by a urologic pathologist. Criteria to be evaluated include: World 
Health Organization/International Society of Urologic Pathology (WHO/ISUP) 
histologic subtype and grade, TNM 2002 pathologic tumor stage, the presence 
and type of intratumoral lymphocytic infiltration, and the quantity and location of 
PD-L1 staining. The tumor will be considered positive for PD-1, PD- L1, PD-L2 if 
>5% of tumor cells had histologic evidence of plasma membrane staining.
8.3 NGS
Ten FFPE  unstained slides, 5μm sections on positively charged, unbaked slides and a 
terminal H&E slide and matched normal sample (blood) will be stored in the Meeks Lab 
until analysis.  Analysis will be performed on archived tissue samples obtained at

8.5 Peripheral  blood cytokine assays and lymphocyte phenotypes
Two 3  mL lavender EDTA tubes will be collected from patients prior to dosing at weeks -
2, 0, and 17 at the time of other lab collection. One tube of blood will be transported 
immediately to the Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory for processing.  Lymphocyte 
subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11c, CD19, and CD 45, CD56, Gr-1) will be analyzed 
according to absolute cell numbers per microliter of whole blood, percent representation 
among all lymphocytes, and coexpression of the activation markers CD25, HLA-DR, and 
CD45RO using automated flow cytometric techniques at the Flow Cytometry Core 
Laboratory, Robert H Lurie Cancer Center of Northwestern University under the 
supervision of Suchitra Swaminathan, PhD. 
The second tube  of blood will be processed in the Pathology Core Facility prior to 
shipment to Myriad Laboratories for cytokine analysis. A portion of the blood specimens 
that have been collected for cytokine analysis (time-points week -2, week 0, and week 
17) may be used in plasma PK assays, per Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9106].
8.6 Specimen  Banking
Patient samples  collected for this study and not entirely exhausted by [CONTACT_199962] (see separate lab manual for location 
details). Specimens will be stored indefinitely and may be used for future, unspecified 
testing. If future use is denied or withdrawn by [CONTACT_102], best efforts will be made to 
stop any additional studies and to destroy the specimens.
Joshua Meeks,  MD, PhD will be responsible for reviewing and approving requests for 
clinical specimen  from potential research collaborators outside of Northwestern 
University. Collaborators will be required to complete an agreement (a Material Transfer 
Agreement or recharge agreement) that states specimens will only be released for use 
in disclosed research. Any data obtained from the use of clinical specimen will be the 
property of Northwestern University for publication and any licensing agreement will be 
strictly adhered to. 
The following  information obtained from the subject's medical record may be provided to 
research collaborators when specimens are made available:

9 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS
This is  a Phase I dose escalation study using the 3+3 design with 4 doses.  The dose escalation 
scheme and rules for determining the primary outcome, the maximum tolerated dose, are described 
in Section 4.3. In order to achieve up to 24 evaluable patients for dose limiting toxicity and MTD 
determination, up to 27 patients may be accrued to the study. This 3+3 design has a 91% chance 
(49%, 17%) of dose escalating when the true toxicity rate for that dose is 10% (30%, 50%).  
To achieve  the secondary objectives, the dose limiting toxicities and adverse events will be 
presented as descriptive frequencies and proportions.  Serious adverse events will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_24975], frequency, timing, severity and attribution.

Protocol Amendment  11 Version Date: November 6, 2020 52Exploratory objectives  (PK, response, progression, immune markers) will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics due to the anticipated small study sample size. Progression free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival (OS) will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median PFS and 
OS estimates will be reported along with confidence intervals.
Progression free survival (PFS)  time is calculated as the time that elapses between the initiation of 
trial therapy and the day of first documented disease progression or death from any cause 
(whichever is sooner) for all eligible subjects who receive at least one dose of trial therapy. If 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy is initiated without a preceding disease progression, PFS will be 
censored at the time of initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy. If disease progression or 
death from any cause is not observed prior to completion of study participation or initiation of 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy, the PFS will be censored as the last available disease 
assessment.
Overall survival  (OS) time is calculated as the time that elapses between the initiation of trial 
therapy and the date of death from any cause, date of completion of study participation, or date the 
subject is lost to follow up (whichever is sooner) for all eligible subjects who receive at least one 
dose of trial therapy. If death from any cause is not observed prior to completing study participation, 
the OS will be censored as the time of the last available documentation of survival status.

BEFORE a  patient can be treated on study, please complete and submit the following 
items to confirm eligibility and receive an identification number:
Patient’s  signed and dated informed consent form (upload to NOTIS and keep 
original wet ink consent in a secure location/study chart)
Eligibility  checklist (signed and dated by [CONTACT_1963] – upload to NOTIS)
Eligibility  eCRF (complete in NOTIS)
Copy  of the pathology report (upload to NOTIS)
The QAM will  review all source documentation required to confirm eligibility that is 
readily available in the patient’s electronic medical record (EMR). Any information that is 
not available in the EMR must be de-identified and uploaded in source document section 
of NOTIS. Once the QAM confirms the patient is eligible, he or she will register the 
patient, assign a subject identification number, provide a cohort assignment, and send a 
confirmation of registration to involved personnel. Registration will then be complete and 
the patient may begin study treatment. 
10.4 Data  Management and Monitoring/Auditing
This study  will be conducted in compliance with the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) 
of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University The 
level of risk attributed to this study requires High Intensity Monitoring as outlined in the 
DSMP. The assigned QAM, with oversight from the Data Monitoring Committee, will 
monitor this study in accordance with the study phase and risk level. Please refer to the

10.7 Publication  Policy
All potential publications  and/or data for potential publications (e.g. manuscripts, 
abstracts, posters, clinicaltrials.gov releases) must be approved in accordance with the 
DSMC Data Release Policies and Processes. The assigned QAM will prepare a 
preliminary data set for DSMC approval no later than 3 months after the study reaches 
its primary completion date, as defined by [CONTACT_103927].gov. This is the date that the 
final patient was examined or received an intervention for the purposes of final collection 
of data for the primary outcome, whether the clinical trial concluded according to the pre-
specified protocol or was terminated. If the investigator would like data release to be 
approved by [CONTACT_199965], and/or prior to three 
months after a study’s primary completion date, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163202] a written request for 
data approval to the QAM which includes justification. Requests must be made a 
minimum of six to eight weeks in advance of the expected deadline. The request will be 
presented to the DSMC at their next available meeting. Any DSMC decisions regarding 
data release will be provided to the PI. If the request is approved, the QAM will present 
the data set to the DSMC for approval. A final, DSMC-approved dataset, as applicable, 
will then be released 6-[ADDRESS_238486]/poster/manuscript to the study’s biostatistician and assigned QAM to confirm 
that the DSMC-approved data and statistical analyses are used appropriately. Once the 
biostatistician and QAM gives final approval, the publication may be submitted to 
external publisher.

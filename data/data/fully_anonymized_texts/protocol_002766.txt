!All subjects will receive apremilast [ADDRESS_879103] of four phases:
!Screening Phase – up to 35 days
!Double-blind Placebo-controlled Phase – Weeks 0 to 16
Subjects will receive treatment with one of the following:  
∀apremilast 30 mg tablets orally BID or
∀placebo tablets (identical in appearan ce to apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally BID
!Apremilast Extension Phase – Weeks 16 to 32
∀All subjects will be switched to (or continue with) apremilast 30 mg BID at 
Week 16. All subjects will maintain this dosing through Week 32.
!Observational Follow-up Phase
∀Four-week Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase for all subjects who 
complete the study or discontinue from the study early.
After all subjects have completed the Week 16 Visit (or discontinued from the study), a Week 16 
database lock will be performed; the primary data analysis will be conducted  
.  However, unblinded data will only be made available 
to select Sponsor and Contract Research Organization (CRO) team members involved with 
analysis of the data .  All other Sponsor, 
site, and CRO personnel directly involved with  the conduct of the study, will remain blinded to 
treatment assignments until the final database lock  at the conclusion of the study. At the end of 
the study, ie, when all subjects have also co mpleted (or have been di scontinued) the Apremilast
Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 32) and the Observational Follow-up Phase, the final analysis will be performed and a final Clinical Study Report will be generated.
The study will be conducted in compliance wi th the International Council for Harmonisation 
(ICH) of Technical Requirements for Regist ration of Phar maceuticals for Human Use/G ood 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.
Study Population
Adult subjects ≥ 18 years of age with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Psoriasis Area and 
Severity Index [PASI] ≥ 12, and Body Surface Area [BSA] ≥ 10%, and Static Physician Global 
Assessment [sPGA] ≥ 3 [moderate or greater]) who also ha ve moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis of the scalp (Scalp Physician Global Assessment ≥ 3 [moderate or greater], and Scalp 
Surface Area ≥ 20%, and having had an inadequate response or intolerance to at least one topi[INVESTIGATOR_186691] [for example, potent or super potent topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], vitamin D analogs, and 
combination products] for plaque psoriasis of the scalp).

Study Treatments
All IP will be provided in blister cards throughout  the entire study.  Apremilast will be provided 
as 10, 20, or [ADDRESS_879105] (IP) will be taken or ally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart, 
without restriction of food or drink.  To mitigate potential gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, dose titration will be implemented in the first week of this study and at Week [ADDRESS_879106] 30 mg BID treatment.  
During Week 0 (Days 1 to 7), subjects will be dispensed dose titration blister cards with 10, 20, 
and [ADDRESS_879107] 7 days containing the titration 
supplies or matching placebo (see Table 4 : Treatment Schema for Dose Titration at Visit 2 
[Week 0]) which details the titration supplies from Day 1 to Day 7 in the Placebo-controlled 
Treatment Phase.  IP will be dispensed as indicated below: 
!Weeks 0 to 16: Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Treatment Phase: Apremilast 30 mg 
BID or placebo BID. 
∀Week 0 to 1: subjects will be dose titrated as described above.
!Weeks 16 to 32: Apremilast Extension Phase: Apremilast 30 mg BID.
∀Week 16 to 17: subjects will be dose titrated as described below.
At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomized using a permuted block 
randomization in  parallel 2:[ADDRESS_879108] 30 mg BID or placebo, using a 
centralized Interactive Re sponse Technology (IRT). 
Starting at Week 16, all subjects will be switched to, or will continue with apremilast. Subjects 
originally randomized to placebo at Week [ADDRESS_879109] 30 mg BID at Week 16 (see Table 5 Treatment Schema for Dose Titration at Visit 7 [Week 16]) which details 
the titration supplies from Day [ADDRESS_879110]; dummy titration blister cards (dosing at 30 mg BID directly) will be used for subjects initially randomized to 
receive apremilast [ADDRESS_879111] 30 mg tablets which are to be taken twice daily.
Dose modifications are not permissible in this study.

(CMH) test adjusted by [CONTACT_655083]. Missing values at Week 16 will 
be imputed using the multiple imputation (MI) method as the primary analysis. Sensitivity 
analyses will be performed us ing the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method and the 
non-responder imputation (NRI) method. The binary secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoint. 
The analysis for the continuous secondary endpoint will be performed using the analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model. The ANCOVA model will use the change from baseline as the dependent variable and will include treatment group and stratification factor as independent 
variables and the baseline value as a covariate variable.
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_655084]-controlled Phase 
(Weeks 0 to 16) and Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 32). When appropriate, 
exploratory endpoints at Week [ADDRESS_879117] one dose of IP. Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_655085]-emergent adverse ev ents (TEAEs), laboratory tests, vital signs, 
and electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. Data from safety assessments will be summarized 
descriptively for the Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and the Apremilast Exposure 
Period. Adverse events will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification system. All TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], 
preferred term, severity, and relationship to IP.  TEAEs leading to death or to IP withdrawal and 
serious TEAEs will also be summarized and listed separately.

psoriasis, is typi[INVESTIGATOR_655053], demarcated erythematous plaques covered by a 
silvery scale ( Lebwohl, 2003a ).  The scalp is the most frequent area affected by [CONTACT_655079], 
occurring in up to 80% of patients ( van de Kerkhof, 1998 ).  These lesions can affect the hair-
bearing areas of the scalp, extending past the hair line, as well as in the retroauricular area and on 
the neck.  The lesions and associated flaking can be visible as well as highly pruritic, causing a 
negative impact on the patient’s quality of life ( Kragballe, 2013; Szepi[INVESTIGATOR_110425], 2016 ). 
The presence of scalp hair makes application of topi[INVESTIGATOR_655054], limiting their effectiveness as well as compliance ( Warren, 2008; Feldman,
2003 ). Currently approved topi[INVESTIGATOR_655055].  In addition, potent topi[INVESTIGATOR_655056], skin atrophy, 
striae, telangiectasia, and hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_221415]-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression ( van der 
Vleuten , 2001 ; Hogan, 1989 ).  Other topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491], such as coal tar and anthralin preparations 
have cosmetically unappealing formulations, foul odor, limited efficacy, and potential 
carcinogenic risk ( Chan, 2009 ).  Second-line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655057], however, safety and efficacy d ata from c ontrolled clinical trials for 
these agents is limited ( Chan, 2009 ).  Efficacy data from controlled clinical trials involving 
treatment with biologics, such as ixekizumab has only recently been published ( Reich, 2016 ).  
Thus, there remains an unmet medical need in treating plaque psoriasis of the scalp, particularly 
in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp.
1.2. Compound Background 
Apremilast (CC-[ZIP_CODE]) is a specific phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor under development for use in the treatment of inflammat ory conditions.  PDE4 is one of the major 
phosphodiesterases expressed in leukocytes. PDE4 inhibition by [CONTACT_655086] (cAMP) levels in immune cells, which in turn down-regulates the 
inflammatory response by [CONTACT_394815]-inflammatory mediators such as tumor 
necrosing factor (TNF)- α, interleukin (IL)-23, IL-17, and other inflammatory cytokines, and 
increasing the production of anti-inflammatory mediators. 
In completed Phase [ADDRESS_879131] (OTEZLA
®) is approved in approximately forty countries worldwide for the treatment 
of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis  and the treatment of patients with moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.
Apremilast remains under further clinical development for the treatment of inflammatory/ 
autoimmune disorders including Behçet’s disease, and ulcerative colitis. Further studies within the approved indications of plaque psorias is and psoriatic art hritis are also ongoing.

1.3. Rationale
1.3.1. Study Rationale and Purpose
Plaque psoriasis of the scalp is often challenging to treat.  Scalp skin is also relatively 
inaccessible, making topi[INVESTIGATOR_655059] ( Ortonne, 2009 ).  
Given the visibility of the lesions and the scaling/ flaking as well as the itch associated with the 
disease, patients with plaque psoriasis of the scalp often experience considerable physical, 
psychological and social impacts to quality of life.
There remains an unmet medical need in treating p laque psoriasis of the scalp as currently 
approved topi[INVESTIGATOR_655060], poor treatment compliance, limited efficacy, and cosmetic appeal. As well, potent topi[INVESTIGATOR_655061], skin 
atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_221415]-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Other 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491], such as coal tar and anthralin preparations, have the additional risk of carcinogenesis. Second-line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655062], however safety and efficacy data from controlled clinical trials for most of 
these agents is limited.   Efficacy data from controlled clinical trials involving treatment with 
biologics, such as ixekizumab has only recently been published.
Apremilast (CC-[ZIP_CODE]) is a specific phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor approved for the 
treatment of both psoriasis and psoriatic arthriti s.  In Phase [ADDRESS_879133] 30 mg twice daily 
(BID) in the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp.
1.3.2. Rationale for the Study Design
Exploratory analyses from the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] [ADDRESS_879134] in subjects with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Study PSOR-008 and Study PSOR-009) demonstrated that 
apremilast 30 mg BID provided a treatment benefi t in the subset of subjects who also presented 
with plaque psoriasis of the scalp of moderate or greater severity at baseline using a six-point 
Scalp Physician Global Assessment (ScPGA).  The 6-point ScPGA scale ranged from 0 (clear), 
1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe), to 5 (very severe).
This study will directly investigate the safe ty and efficacy of apremilast 30 mg BID, compared 
with placebo, in the treatment of subjects with mode rate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp.  
The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects who achieved ScPGA response at Week 16 (defined as ScPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2-point 
reduction from baseline at Week 16), based on th e intent-to-treat (ITT ) population.  Based on 
Health Authority feedback, this study will us e a 5-point ScPGA scale ranging from 0 (clear), 
1 (almost clea r), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), instead of the 6-point scale used in prior

with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Study PSOR-008 and Study PSOR-009) demonstrated improvement in itch severity using a Visual An alog Scale (VAS). In this study, improvement of 
itch will be assessed using Numeric Rating Scales (NRS) as these are considered to have better 
reliability and precision, and lesser potenti al for missing values, than the VAS ( Phan, 2012 ). The 
first secondary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects with ≥4-point reduction 
(improvement) from baseline in the Whole Body Itch NRS score at Week 16.  It is anticipated 
that approximately 80% of the subjects would be evaluable for this analysis, based on prior experience in Studies PSOR-008 and PSOR-009 as well as other clinical trials in moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis ( Griffiths, 2015 ).
Eligible subjects will be randomized 2:[ADDRESS_879136] to baseline severity of scalp psoriasis.

6.4. Efficacy Assessments
The following assessments will be conducted as outlined in the Table of Events, Table 3 :
!Numeric Rating Scale Assessments
Whole Body Itch Numeric Rating Scale Assessment
Prior to any other procedures or a ssessments being performed during the treatment 
period, the subject w ill be asked to assess whole body itch and select a number on a 
scale of 0-10, where “0” represents no itch, and “10” represents the worst imaginable 
itch.  The number selected by [CONTACT_655099].  SeeAppendix C .
The Whole Body Itch NRS scale has been validated among patients with moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis, and a 4-point change from baseline was shown to be optimal for demonstrating a level of clinically meaningful improvement in itch severity 
(Kimball, 2016 ).
Scalp Itch Numeric Rating Scale Assessment
After completing the Whole Body Itch NRS, the subject will be asked to assess scalp 
itch and select a number on a scale of 0-10, where “0” represents no itch, and “10” 
represents the worst imaginable itch.  The number selected by [CONTACT_655099].  See Appendix D .
The Scalp Itch NRS was derived from the Whole Body Itch NRS.

The ScPGA is a measurement of overall scalp involvement by [CONTACT_655100].  The ScPGA is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the disease: 
erythema, scaling and plaque elevation.  When making the assessment of overall 
scalp severity, the Investigator should factor in areas that have already been cleared (ie, have scores of 0) and not just evaluate remaining lesions for severity, ie, the 
severity of each sign is averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared 
lesions.

6.5. Safety Assessments
!Contraception Education
The risks to a fetus or to a nursing child from apremilast are not known at this time.  
Results of animal and in vitro studies can be found in the IB.
All females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must use one of the approved 
contraceptive options as described in Section 4.2while on IP and for at least [ADDRESS_879162]’s chosen form of 
contraception must be effective by [CONTACT_81662] (for example, hormonal contraception should be initiated at least 28 days before 
randomization).
At screening and at baseline, and at any time during the study when a female subject 
of childbearing potential’s contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant 
changes, the Investigator will educate the subject regarding contraception options and 
correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent pregnancy.
!Serum and Urine Pregnancy Tests for Females of Childbearing Potential 
(FCBP)
A serum pregnancy test with a sensitivity of ≤ 25 mIU/mL will be required for FCBP 
subjects at screening and at the Early Termination or Last Treatment Visit.  In 
addition, a local urine pregnancy test kit will be provided by [CONTACT_655101], prior to 
dosing.  An unscheduled pregnancy test s hould be performed if the FCBP subject has 
missed a menstrual period.
!Chest Radiograph (CXR)
A CXR is required during Screening.  A PA v iew is required; an additional lateral 
view is strongly recommended but not required.  Alternatively, PA or PA/lateral 
radiographs that were taken within the [ADDRESS_879163] radiographs should be perfor med as indicated by [CONTACT_655102]/immunomodulatory therapy.  If 
such guidelines are not available/applicable, routine CXRs should be performed when clinically indicated.
!Hepatitis B and C
Hepatitis testing will include hepatitis B su rface antigen and anti-hepatitis C antibody.

The QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test should be used in lieu of the tuberculin skin test 
(TST) or purified protein derivative ([COMPANY_003]) skin test if possible.  This test result must 
be negative within one month prior to first administration of IP or prior completed 
treatment was documented.  
!Vital Signs, Height, and Weight
Vital signs, including temperature, pulse, and seated blood pressure, will be taken 
during the visits indicated in Table 3. Height will be measured and recorded at 
Screening; weight will also be measured and recorded at screening and then as 
indicated in Table 3 . Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated at Screening.
!Complete Physical Examination
A complete physical examination includes evaluations of skin, nasal cavities, eyes, 
ears, lymph nodes, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, and 
musculoskeletal systems.  The complete physical examination is done at screening 
and at the Early Termination or Last Treatment Visit (Visit 10).
!Vasculitis Assessment
The PDE4 inhibitors, including apremilast, have been shown to produce 
inflammatory perivascular histopathological changes in animal studies (eg, rodent 
toxicology studies).  The Investigator should be watchful for any signs and symptoms of vasculitis at all times.  Any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655069], doing a physical examination, reviewing adverse 
events, and performing diagnostic procedures, as clinically indicated.  A subject with signs and symptoms of possible vasculitis should receive a thorough evaluation as 
described above, be managed as medically appropriate, and continued with follow-up 
until the signs and symptoms of vasculitis have resolved.
!Psychiatric Evaluation
Apremilast prescriber information (eg, Summary of Product Characteristics, Package 
insert) includes a warning regarding depression and suicidal thoughts. Patients with 
chronic diseases may be prone to depression. The risks and benefits of starting or continuing treatment with apremilast should be carefully assessed if patients report 
previous or existing psychiatric symptoms or if concomitant treatment with other 
medicinal products likely to cause  psychiatric events is intended. At any time during 
the study (post-randomization), subjects who have suicidal thoughts or behavior 
should be evaluated. If the psychiatrist deems the subject not to be a risk for suicide, 
the subject may remain in the study, but if a risk of suicide is confirmed, the subject 
must be discontinued from the study. If the subject is discontinued, the subject 
should return for the Observational Follow-up Visit.
A copy of the psychiatric evaluation report must be in the subject’s source 
documentation, especially if the subject is confirmed not to be at risk for suicide and 
is continuing in the study.

A 12-lead ECG will be performed after the subject has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044] 
3 minutes.  ECGs will be performed at screening as indicated in Table 3.   ECGs will 
be evaluated by a central reader.
!Clinical Laboratory Evaluations
Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed by a central laboratory and as 
indicated in Table 3. Clinical laboratory evaluations include complete blood count 
(red blood cell [RBC] count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count and differential, absolute WBC counts, platelet count); serum chemistries (total 
protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorous, glucose, total cholesterol [TC], triglycerides, 
high-density lipoprotein [HDL], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C ], adiponectin, uric acid, total bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase [AST; serum glutamic-oxaloacetic 
transaminase, SGOT], alanine aminotransferase [ALT; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, SGPT], sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate [carbon dioxide, 
CO
2], blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and 
magnesium); as well as Hemoglobin A1C at the Screening Visit, and dipstick urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose,  ketones, protein, blood, bilirubin, leukocyte 
esterase, nitrite, and urobilinogen).  Dipstick urinalysis will be performed by [CONTACT_19979]; microscopic urinalysis (epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], RBC, WBC, and casts) will be performed only if the dipstick urinalysis is abnormal.
Fasting is not required.  However, if significant elevation of serum lipid(s) is 
observed, a fasting re-test should be requested to determine whether or not elevation was caused by [CONTACT_188103].  
!Psoriasis Flare Assessments
Psoriasis flare represents an atypi [INVESTIGATOR_477040] ( Carey, 2006 ).  It is defined as a sudden intensification of psoriasis 
requiring medical intervention or a diagnosis of new generalized erythrodermic, 
inflammatory, or pustular psoriasis.  A m ore typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], gradual worsening of plaque 
psoriasis would not be recorded as an adverse event (AE).

scalp itch NRS efficacy assessments and in the order that they are described below 
and as indicated in Table 3 .
!
 
 
!Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)
During the treatment phase (see Table 3 ), DLQI ( Finlay, 1994 ) will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_655103], after completing the Whole Body Itch NRS, S calp 
Itch NRS,  and prior to any other procedures or assessments 
being performed.  The DLQI was developed as a simple, compact, and practical 
questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease ( Finlay, 1994 ).  The instrument contains [ADDRESS_879165]’s skin.  With the exception of Item Number 7, the subject responds 
on a four-point scale, ranging from “Very Much” to “Not at All.”  Item Number [ADDRESS_879166]’s skin prevented 
them from working or studying (Yes or No), and if “No,” then the subject is asked 
how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being “A lot,” “A little,” or “Not at all.”  
The DLQI Total score has a possible range from [ADDRESS_879167] that the DLQI can be grouped into six subscales: symptoms and 
feelings; daily activities; leisure; work/school; personal relationships; and treatment.  
Scores for four of the subscales (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, and personal relationships) range from 0 to 6; scores for two of the subscales 
(work/school and treatment) range from 0 to 3.  Higher scores correspond to poorer 
health-r elated qu ality of life.  See Appendix F .

Confidential and Propri etary 47 CC-[ZIP_CODE]- SPSO-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_879178] will be taken orally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart, without 
restriction of food or drink.  To mitigate potential gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, dose titration 
will be implemented in this study.  During Week 1 (Days 1-7) and Week 16 (when placebo 
subjects are switched to receive apremilast 30 mg BID), subjects will be dispensed blister cards 
with 10, 20, and [ADDRESS_879179](s) only.  Therefore, for a drug to be subject to the overdose definition it must be both 
required and an investigational drug.  In this study the only required and investigational drug is 
apremilast and the control arm drug (ie, placebo), he nce overdose definition will apply to only 
apremilast (or matching pl acebo).  Other required or optional non-IP intended for prophylaxis of 
certain side effects, etc, are excluded from this definition.
Overdose for this protocol, on a per dose basis, is defined as ingestion of [ADDRESS_879180] (or matching placebo) tablets in any 24-hour period whether by [CONTACT_285917]. On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as dosing more than 4 
times during any 24-hour peri od. 
7.4. Method of Treatment Assignment
At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomized using a permuted block 
randomization in  parallel 2:[ADDRESS_879181] 30 mg BID or placebo, using a 
centralized Interactive Response Technology (IRT).  Designated research personnel at the 
investigational sites will be assigned passw ord protected, coded identification numbers, which 
gives them authorization to enter the IRT to randomize subjects.  
The system will present a menu of questions by [CONTACT_655104]. When all questions have been answered and the subject 
deemed eligible, the IRT will assign a randomization identification number.  
Confirmation of the randomization will be sent to the investigational site, Celgene, and/or its 
representative. The confirmation reports should be maintained as source documents. During the 
study visits, the pharmacy or authorized study pers onnel at the investigational site will dispense 
coded IP kits in accordance with the rando mization number assigned by [CONTACT_6606].

The Investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for accounting for all IP that is issued to and returned by [CONTACT_137825].
The Investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of IP 
received, and comparing it with the accompanying IP accountability form.  The Investigator(s) or 
Pharmacist(s) will verify the accuracy of the information on the form, sign and date it, retain a copy in the study file, and return a copy to Celgene.
At the study site, all IP will be stored in a locked, safe area to prevent unauthorized access.
The IP should be stored as directed on the package label.Celgene (or designee) will review with the Inve stigator and relevant site personnel the process 
for IP return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the site versus Celgene 
(or designee). 
7.6.1. Record of Administration
Accurate recording of all IP administration (including dispensing and dosing) will be made in the 
appropriate section of the subject’s eCRF and source documents.
7.7. Investigational Product Compliance
Study personnel will review the instructions printed on the package with the study subjects prior to dispensing the IP.  Investigational product will be dispensed as noted in the Table of Events,Table 3.   The subjects will be instructed to return the IP containers, including any unused 
medication, to the study site at each visit for tablet counts and reconciliation.  Subjects will be 
asked whether they have taken their IP as inst ructed at each study visit.  Any problems with IP 
compliance will be reviewed with the subject.  If a subject misses [ADDRESS_879183] should be terminated from the Treatment Phase of the study, and enter into the Observational Follow-up Phase.
Gross compliance problems (eg, missing 4 or more consecutive days of dosing or taking less 
than 75% of the doses between study visits) are prot ocol deviations and should be discussed with 
Celgene.  Overall compliance with the study treatment regimen is defined as taking between 
75% and 120% of the expected doses during a subject’s participation while in the treatment 
phases (Placebo-controlled Phase and Apremilast Extension Phases) of the study.

psoriasis of the scalp. Treatment assignment will be stratified by [CONTACT_655107] 
[moderate (3), or severe (4)]. 
The objective of the statistical analysis will be to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast 
[ADDRESS_879186] completed the Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16), the primary 
analysis will be performed.  At the study comple tion, ie, when all subjects have also completed 
the Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 32) and the Observational Follow-up Phase, the final analysis will be performed. To maintain the blind at the site and subject level, the individual 
subject treatment assignments will not be revealed to the investigators until after the final 
database lock following the study completion.
9.2. Study Population Definitions
The safety population will consist of all subjects who are randomized and received at least one 
dose of IP (IP).  Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the IP they actually receive.
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all sub jects who are randomized. Subjects 
will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized.
The per protocol (PP) population will consist of all subjects included in the ITT population who 
receive at least one dose of IP (IP), have both baseline and at least one post-treatment ScPGA 
evaluation, and have no protocol deviations which may affect analyses in the Placebo-controlled 
Phase.
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
The sample size est imation is based on the results of the Phase [ADDRESS_879187] 30 mg BID and placebo in the proportion of subjects achieving ScPGA 
response at Week 16 (range 18% to 29%). Approximate ly 300 subjects will be randomized in a 
2:[ADDRESS_879188] 90% pow er to detect a minimum treatment difference of 
18% (38% for apremilast 30 mg BID versus 20% for placebo) between the two arms for 
proportions of subjects achieving ScPGA response at Week 16 (defined as ScPGA score of clear [0] or almost clear [1] with at least a 2 point reduction from baseline at Week 16).
If at least 60% of the approximate 300 randomized subjects would be evaluable for the whole 
body itch NRS an alysis, the subset sample size of 180 subjects will provide 90% power to detect 
a treatment difference of 25% (45% for apremila st 30 mg BID and 20% for placebo) in the

9.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics
Subject’s age, height, weight, and baseline char acteristics will be summar ized using descriptive 
statistics, while sex, race and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency 
tabulations.  Medical history data will be summarized using frequency tabulations by [CONTACT_10607] (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term.
9.5. Subject Disposition
Subject disposition (analysis population allocat ion, entered, discontinued, along with primary 
reason for discontinuation) will be summarized using frequency tabulations and percent for the Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and the Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 32).  
A summary of subjects enrolled by [CONTACT_27707]. Protocol deviations will be summarized 
using frequency distributions.
9.6. Efficacy Analysis
9.6.1. Efficacy Evaluation for the Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16)
Statistical comparisons will be made between apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo. All statistical 
tests will be at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level and the corresponding p-values will be 
reported. Data summaries will be provided for the two randomized treatment arms (apremilast 30 
mg BID and placebo).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary endpoint is the proportions of subjects who achieving ScPGA response at Week 16 
(defined as ScPGA score of clear [0] or almost cl ear [1] with at least a 2-point reduction from 
baseline at Week 16).  It will be analyzed using the  ITT population. A sensitivity analysis will be 
performed using the PP population. 
The treatment difference between apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo will be compared using 
CMH (Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel) test adjusting for the stratification factor at randomization. 
The 2-sided p-values from the CMH test, the adjusted treatment difference in proportion using 
the weighted average of the treatment differences across the strata with the CMH weights, along with the associated 2-sided 95% CIs using a nor mal approximation to the weighted average will 
be provided. Missing values at Week 16 will be imputed using the multiple imputation (MI) 
method (SAS Institute Inc. 2008) as the primary analysis, with sensitivity analysis using the last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) met hod and the non-responder imputation (NRI) method.
The SAS procedure MI will be used to impute missing ScPGA scores at the scheduled 
assessments in the Placebo-controlled Phase (Week s 0-16) to create M=25 complete data sets. 
The missing data patterns will be checked by [CONTACT_655108] 
(Week 0), and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16. If there are non-monotone missing patterns, two 
separate imputation procedures will be used to complete the imputation process.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
For the binary endpoints defined as ≥4-point reduction (improvement) from the baseline visit in 
either the whole body pruritus NRS score or the scalp pruritus NRS score at post-baseline visits, 
the analyses will be based on subjects in th e ITT population with ba seline whole body pruritus 
NRS score ≥4 or baseline scalp pruritus NRS score ≥4, respectively. For the continuous 
secondary endpoint (ie, change from baseline in  DLQI total score at Week 16), the analyses will 
be based on ITT population. Unadjusted 2-sided p-values and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) will be reported.
In order to evaluate the onset of effect of apremilast 30 mg BID compared to placebo for itch, the 
following secondary endpoints are specified (Section 2):
!Proportion of subjects with ≥4-point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the 
whole body itch NR S score at Week 16
!Proportion of subjects with ≥4-point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the 
scalp itch NRS score at Week 16
!Proportion of subjects with ≥4-point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the 
overall body itch NRS score at Week 12, Week 8, Week 4, and Week 2
!Proportion of subjects with ≥4-point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the 
scalp itch NRS score at Week 12, Week 8, Week 4, and Week [ADDRESS_879193] from Week 16 
to Week 2. Multip licity adjustment is sp ecified in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
The binary endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoint. The treatment 
difference at each time point between apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo will be compared using 
CMH (Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel) test adjusting for the stratification factor at randomization.
The 2-sided p-values from the CMH test, the adjusted treatment difference in proportion using the weighted average of the treatment differences across the strata with the CMH weights, along

endpoint, with sensitivity analysis using the LOCF method and NRI method.
The continuous endpoint (ie, change from bas eline in DLQI total score at Week 16) will be 
analyzed based on the ITT population using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The ANCOVA model will use the change from baseline as the dependent variable and will include 
treatment group and stratification fact or as independent variables and the baseline value as a 
covariate variable. Within- group least-squa res (LS) mean changes from baseline at Week 16, the 
associated standard errors (SEs) and 2-sided 95% CIs, treatment differences in LS mean changes 
from baseline, and the associated 2-sided 95% CIs  and p-values, will be derived from the 
ANCOVA model. Missing values at Week 16 will be imputed using the MI method, with sensitivity analysis using the LOCF method.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Multiplicity Adjustment
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be hierarchically ranked for testing in order 
to control the overall type I error rate in claiming statistical significance at the 2-sided 0.05 
significance level.  Specifically, for the primary efficacy endpoint (ScPGA response at Week 
16), if the 2-sided p-value from the comparison between apremilast [ADDRESS_879194] sequence for the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints is listed as the following:
!Proportion of subjects with ScPGA score of cl ear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least 
a 2-point reduction from baseline at Week 16
!Proportion of subjects with ≥4 point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the 
whole body itch NR S score at Week 16
!Proportion of subjects with ≥4 point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the 
scalp itch NRS score at Week 16
!Proportion of subjects with ≥4 point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the 
whole body itch NR S score at Week 12
!Proportion of subjects with ≥4 point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the 
scalp itch NRS score at Week 12
!Proportion of subjects with ≥4 point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the 
whole body itch NR S score at Week 8

disease characteristics will be provided to determine the robustness of the treatment effect.
 
 
 
9.6.2. Efficacy Evaluation – Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 32)
Efficacy endpoints for time points beyond Week 16 will be summarized according to the 
treatment assigned at randomization. For all subj ects, changes in measurements will be 
calculated relative to measurements obtained  at baseline (Week 0). Descriptive summary 
statistics or proportion of subjects achieving specified criteria will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. For continuous variables, descriptive statis tics for baseline and changes or percent 
changes from baseline will be provided. Categorical variables will be summarized with 
frequency tabulations. 2-sided 95% confidence in tervals will be provided for changes or percent 
changes and response rates.
9.7. Safety Analysis
The safety analyses will be performed using the safety population as  defined in Section 9.2. 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_477052]-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG 
measurements; no inferential testing for statist ical signif icance will be performed.
Adverse events will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) classification system. Adverse events will be tabulated for the Placebo-controlled 
Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and the Apremilast Expos ure Phase in the study. All TEAEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, severity, and relationship to IP.  Adverse

laboratory test values (as specifi ed by [CONTACT_14540] 10.3), regardless of etiology. Any 
worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse ch ange in the frequency or intensity of a pre-
existing condition) should be cons idered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on 
the AE page of the case report form (CRF) rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the 
diagnosis or syndrome. 
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose CRF. (See Section 7.3for the definition of overdose.) Any sequela of 
an accidental or intentional overdose of an investigational product should be reported as an AE 
on the AE CRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE CRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be identified 
as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and CRF but should not be reported as an SAE 
itself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary.  There is no known specific antidote for apremilast overdose. 
Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameters: the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, radiological or surgical findings , physical examination findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_292004] [ADDRESS_879200]’s source documents.  All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972],

Protocol CC-[ZIP_CODE]-SPSO-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 60 CC-[ZIP_CODE]- SPSO-001 Amendment 1 Final: 30 Nov 201710.2.2. Severity/Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity/ intensity of the event based on 
the descriptions listed below. 
Mild
!Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only
!Intervention not indicated
!Activities of daily life (ADLs) minimally or not affected
!No or minimal intervention/therapy may be required 
Moderate 
!Symptom(s) cause moderate discomfort
!Local or noninvasive intervention indicated
!More than minimal interference with ADLs but able to carry out daily social and 
functional activities.
!Drug therapy may be required
Severe (could be non-serious or serious) 
!Symptoms causing severe discomfort/pain
!Symptoms requiring medical/surgical attention/intervention
!Interference with ADLs including inability to perform daily social and functional 
activities (eg, absenteeism and/or bed rest)
!Drug therapy is required
The term “severe” is often used to describe th e intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.  
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a gui de for defining regulatory obligations.
10.2.3. Causality
The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP administration is 
unlikely or remote , or other medications, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying c onditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event.
Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP 
caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there

Confidential and Propri etary 61 CC-[ZIP_CODE]- SPSO-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_879201] a causal relationship between the IP and 
the adverse event.
Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_27718], please provide the name [CONTACT_27765].
10.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
10.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation, interruption, or dose reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if 
concomitant and/or additional treatments were given for the event. 
10.2.6. Outcome
The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to 
the SAE).
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:
!results in discontinuation from the study;
!requires treatment, modification/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervention; or
!is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicity, or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing condition.
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  If the abnormality was not a 
part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be r ecorded as the AE. If 
possible, the laboratory abnormality should be r ecorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, record throm bocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).

Confidential and Propri etary 62 CC-[ZIP_CODE]- SPSO-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_879202] of childbearing potential 
are immediately reportable events .
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated β-subunit of human chorionic 
gonadotropin [ β-hCG] or positive pregnancy test in a female subject of childbearing potential 
regardless of disease state) occurring while the sub ject is on IP, or within [ADDRESS_879203]’s 
last dose of IP, are considered immediately reportable events.  Investigational product is to be 
discontinued immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused portion of the IP to the investigator.  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy,  or positive pregnancy test must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety immediately by [CONTACT_6968], phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method, 
using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist or another appropriate 
healthcare professional for further evaluation.
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate
method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_879204] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant deat h after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by 
[CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method (eg, via email), using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent 
form.  This instruction pertains to initial SA E reports as well as any follow-up reports.
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study 
(from the time the subject signs i nformed consent until [ADDRESS_879205] dose of IP) or any 
SAE made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP.  Serious adverse events occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27598].  If a subject died and an autopsy has been performed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_493054] h certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug

12.2. Emergency Identification of Investigational Products
The blind must not be broken during the course of the study unless in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], it is absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject.  If it is medically imperative to 
know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily discontinued if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], continuing IP can negatively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment.
The decision to break the blind in emergency situations remains the responsibility of the treating 
physician, which will not be delayed or refused by [CONTACT_1034].  However, the Investigator may contact [CONTACT_81695], mainly in the 
interest of the subject. 
The Investigator should ensure that the code is  broken only in accordance with the protocol. The 
Investigator should promptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency unblinding and the 
reason for breaking the blind, which should be clearly documented by [CONTACT_292054]’s source documentation.
Emergency unblinding should only be performed by  [CONTACT_292055] (PIN), and the Investigator should contact
[CONTACT_655111].

Confidential and Propri etary 67 CC-[ZIP_CODE]- SPSO-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_879212], evaluation, and 
documentation of this study are designed to ens ure that Celgene, its authorized representative, 
and Investigator abide by [CONTACT_23663] (GCP), as described in International Council for
Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will  receive approval from an IRB/EC prior to 
commencement. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with 
applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.
13.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulations. Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all Investigators who in turn will select their staff.
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assi sting with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments,  as well as study-related duties and functions, 
including obligations of confidentiality of Celgene information. The Investigator should maintain 
a list of Sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has 
delegated significant study-related duties.
The Investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent 
form (ICF) and are screened for entry into the study .  Subjects who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study-related charts) for source data verification.  The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries.
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with the exception of the 
information provided by [CONTACT_184689]) is considered Celgene confidential 
information.  Only information that is previously disclosed by [CONTACT_184690] a public registry 
website may be freely disclosed by [CONTACT_655113], or as outlined in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement.  Celgene protocol, amendment a nd IB information is not to be made publicly 
available (for example on the Investigator’s or their institution’s website) without express written 
approval from Celgene.  Information propos ed for posting on the Investigator’s or their 
institution’s website must be submitted to Celgene for review and approval, providing at least [ADDRESS_879213] and/or their caregiver as agreed by [CONTACT_1560].

prior to any study related procedures.
Documentation that informed consent occurred prior to the study subject’s entry into the study 
and of the informed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents including the date.  The original ICF signed and dated by [CONTACT_655114]’s entry into the study, must be maintained 
in the Investigator’s study files and a copy given to  the study subject.  In addition, if a protocol is 
amended and it impacts on the content of the informed consent, the ICF must be revised.  Study 
subjects participating in the study when the amended protocol is implemented must be re-
consented with the revised version of the ICF.  The revised ICF signed and dated by [CONTACT_292058] s ubject must be maintained in the Investigator’s 
study files and a copy given to the study subject.
13.4. Confidentiality
Celgene affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in 
compliance with ICH and other local regulations (w hichever is most stringent). Celgene requires 
the Investigator to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from 
regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in 
accordance with local laws.
Should direct access to medical records require  a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed ICF, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the appropriate i ndividual.
13.5. Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_184693]/Medical Monitor.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.  
Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs.  The 
written signed approval from the IRB/EC should specifically reference the Investigator name, protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are 
administrative in nature do not require IRB/IEC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC 
for information purposes.
13.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval
Before the start of the study, the study protoc ol, ICF, and any other appropriate documents will 
be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents submitted, their 
dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be  submitted to the authorities in accordance with 
local legal requirements.

Confidential and Propri etary 69 CC-[ZIP_CODE]- SPSO-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_879215] of the 
members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/EC will not disclose 
the names, occupations and qualifications of the committee members, it should be asked to issue 
a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list. 
Formal approval by [CONTACT_1201]/EC should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number 
(if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be 
officially signed by a commi ttee membe r. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all 
ethical and legal requirements must be met.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the ICF should also be revised.
The Investigator must keep a record of all comm unication with the IRB/EC  and, if applicable, 
between a Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_72616] /EC. This statement also applies to any 
communication between the Investigator (or Coordinating Investigator, if applicable) and regulatory authorities.
Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed by [CONTACT_27734]/EC prior to use.  
13.7. Ongoing Information for Institutional Review Board/ Ethics 
Committee
If required by [CONTACT_27735]/EC, the Investigator must submit to the IRB/EC:
!Information on serious or unexpected adverse events as soon as possible; 
!Periodic reports on the progress of the study;
!Deviations from the protocol or anything th at may involve added risk to subjects.
13.8. Termination of the Study
Celgene reserves the right to terminate this st udy prematurely at any time for reasonable medical 
or administrative reasons. Any premature discontinuation will be appropriately documented 
according to local requirements (eg, IRB/EC, regulatory authorities, etc.).
In addition, the Investigator or Celgene has the right to discontinue a single site at any time 
during the study for medical or administrative reasons such as:
!Unsatisfactory enrollment;
!GCP noncompliance;
!Inaccurate or incomplete data collection;
!Falsification of records;
!Failure to adhere to the study protocol.

15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after the study.  All aspects of the study are reviewed with the Investigator and the staff at a study initiation visit and/or at an Investigators’ Meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representative will review the protoc ol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and reporting of AEs/ SAEs with the Investigator.  Monitoring will 
include on-site visits with the Investigat or and his/her staff as  well as any appropriate 
communications by [CONTACT_2319], email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, 
investigational product storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study documentation will be inspected/reviewed by [CONTACT_292060].
Accuracy will be checked by [CONTACT_12939] a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
corrections will be made directly to the CRFs or via queries by [CONTACT_11219]/or his/her staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  Additional 
monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan.
15.2. Audits and Inspections
In addition to the routine monitoring procedure s, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celgene standard operating procedures (SOPs) to evaluate 
compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations.
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, CRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for 
audits and inspections by [CONTACT_1744]/ECs, regulatory  authorities (eg, FDA, European Medicines 
Agency [EMA], Health Canada) and company authorized representatives.  The Investigator should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or inspections.  If the Investigator is 
contact[CONTACT_655115], he/she should contact [CONTACT_184696].

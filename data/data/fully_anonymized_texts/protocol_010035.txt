 Purpose of Study and Background
Purpose of the Study
The aim of this investigation is to compare the use of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_5957] (BMAC) 
and allograft versus recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP) versus the gold 
standard fusion in subjects undergoing elective lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_421016]. The 
safety and efficacy of the surgical interventions will be evaluated by [CONTACT_421068]' quality of life outcomes. 
Rationale 
Biologics are almost universally used as an adjunct in spi[INVESTIGATOR_421017] (ability 
to serve as scaffold for bone growth), osteoinductive (ability to stimulate bone growing cells), and 
osteogenic (bone growth cells creating new bone) effects. However, the use of BMP is marginally 
very expensive and has well documented complications such as cancer, wound complication, and 
increased immediate post-operative pain. BMP is a commonly used adjunct for minimally invasive 
surgeries of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_421018], osteinductive, and osteogenic effects without 
the need for autologous bone graft. Recent studies, specifically the study by [CONTACT_421069], M.D. 
using BMAC with allograft, and the study by [CONTACT_405411]. using BMAC with beta-tricalcium 
phosphate during spi[INVESTIGATOR_421019]. In addition, several recent studies using BMAC to treat bone non-unions and osteonecrosis 
(abnormal bone death) have been positive. Therefore, it is believed that BMAC with allograft has 
the same osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and osteogenic effects as BMP without including the 
same complications. Previous research conducted at our own institution has demonstrated clear 
efficacy in the usage of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_421020], in a randomized manner. This has been 
tremendously helpful in our attempt to reduce inefficiencies in the cost of patient. This study 
intends to further investigate and compare the efficacy and long term effects of anterior lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_421021] 2-4 level lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_421022]. 
This study also attempts to enhance our understanding of the cellular mechanisms that correlate 
with outcomes, a point of deficiency in previous studies, by [CONTACT_1583] a cellular analysis component. 
Use of BMAC and allograft may be an alternative to BMP that will limit BMP's increased price, 
known increase of complications, and foreign antibodies. It is anticipated that there will be an 
increase in minimally invasive spi[INVESTIGATOR_421023]. This 
increase in minimally invasive surgery has been reflected in the busy practices of the co-
investigators of this trial who wish to study the comparative efficacy of the [ADDRESS_531323] been very successful when posterior instrumentation is

enrolled will be counted as a screen fail. While both of these products are currently approved for 
use by [CONTACT_74585]/HJD operating room product and pricing committees, through the conduction of 
this research we will also be working with the NYULMC supply chain management team in vetting 
and determining the clinical cost effectiveness of these biologics.   
Background 
Currently, there are numerous orthopaedic graft adjuncts. These include bone morphogenetic 
proteins (BMP), autograft (iliac crest bone graft), graft substitutes, blood, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], 
platelet rich plasma (PRP), embryonic culture-expanded stem cells, and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_421024] (BMAC). Each graft adjunct involves unique advantages and disadvantages. Although 
BMPs and embryonic culture-expanded stem cells are osteoinductive and osteogenic, respectively, 
they are both associated with issues such as high cost and risk of side-effects. When using bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], there is the issue of providing sufficient bioactivity via including a sufficient 
baseline concentration of stem cells. Hence, BMAC presents as a logical means of orthopedic 
grafting. Not only does BMAC demonstrate osteoinductive and osteogenic properties, but it also 
supplies a significantly higher stem cell concentration than sole BMA. 
History of Mesenchymal Stem Cells as Drivers of Tissue Regeneration
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were initially thought to be the most important cell because early 
technology was only capable of expanding and differentiating an MSC in vitro. This led to the 
conclusion that MSCs were the drivers of tissue regeneration and if enough of them were expanded 
and transplanted, we would have clinical success regenerating tissue. However, FDA randomized 
clinical trials using cultured MSCs have failed and recent presentations have shown a negative 
dose effect in cardiac disease (i.e. high dose less effective than medium dose). The new 
understanding is that these cells can be best used for immune modulation rather than tissue 
regeneration. This is important to slow intervertebral disc degeneration.  
Current Understanding: Nonadherent Cells Drive Tissue Regeneration 
It has been noted that nonadherent cells (bone marrow cells), not adherent cells (MSCs), drive 
tissue regeneration. For example, Chen et al. (1997) demonstrated that bone marrow cells (CD34+) 
can form fibroblasts, adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages and can differentiate into 
functional osteoblasts. This finding was repeated by [CONTACT_421070]. (2008), in which they showed 
that CD34+ cells can differentiate to osteoblasts via an MSC intermediate. 
Animal and clinical models have substantiated the finding that nonadherent cells (bone marrow 
cells) drive bone formation. Matsumoto et al. (2008) demonstrated that CD34+ cells delivered 
systemically or locally reliably formed functional bone greater than did controls. When these cells 
Study #S16-[ZIP_CODE] Version 11JULY2024 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_421015], MD 
5 
 were delivered in a matrix, fewer cells were required than systemic administration. Further, 
Hernigou (2005) and Edgard and Einhorn (2011) recommended “the use of concentrated whole 
bone marrow, which includes other cells in the stromal and hematopoietic lineages...as they 
provide an optimized physiological and cellular milieu for the promotion of osteogenesis and 
angiogenesis.”  
Overall, non-adherent cells drive tissue regeneration by: (a) up-regulating cytokine release, which 
stimulates additional HSCs and MSCs from intact bone to the site of damage (Jung 2008); (b) 
releasing BMPs (Jung); (c) up-regulating production of VEGF and other cytokines that support 
angiogenesis and vasculogenesis (Mifune 2008); and, (d) directly forming bone by [CONTACT_421071] (Matsumoto 2006, 2008). 
Advantages of Bone Marrow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_421025], there are two principal multipotent stem cells: stromal stem cells (SSC) and 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). There is roughly one SSC in every 250,000 cells in the marrow 
at age 35 and this ratio decreases with age. There is roughly oneHSC in every 10,000-15,000 cells 
in the marrow (this ratio does not decrease with age). The issue is that with such a small 
concentration of SSCs and HSCs, without concentrating the BMA, there will be unpredictable 
healing, particularly in healing-impaired patients.
 
Hence, the use of BMAC is recommended. When provided in a clinical model, BMAC is given 
with allograft and this combination demonstrates the same angiogenic, osteoinductive, 
osteoconductive, and osteogenic properties as BMP. Further, BMAC exactly mimics and 
supplements the body’s natural response to trauma by [CONTACT_421072]. 
 
Conclusions of previous clinical models 
BMP has been used since 2002 in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_421026], and is now approved for use in posterior and 
transforaminal approaches. BMP augment bony growth is promoting MSC and osteoprogenitor 
cell differentiation into osteoblasts, which is very similar to BMAC. In a 2015 systematic review 
of lumbar fusion rates with the use of rhBMP-2, Galimberti et al showed interbody lumbar fusion 
rates ranging from 97.8-93.6%. However, as detailed in a review of randomized clinic trials by 
[CONTACT_421073] 2013, despi[INVESTIGATOR_421027], there may complications associated with BMP 
such as heterotopic ossification, radiculitis, and endplate osteolysis. While usage of BMP is 
attractive for avoiding autologous grafting—decreasing operative times, blood loss, avoiding 
donor site morbidity, and allowing for biologics in older, more morbid patients that may have a 
limited autograft supply. 
Previous reports by [CONTACT_421074]. , Gangji et al., Hernigou et al., and Gessmann et al. have also 
shown that high concentrations of adult stem cells from iliac crest bone marrow can enhance the 
rate and amount of bone formation. The authors report that technology that quickly and easily 
concentrates bone marrow stem cells 3 to 6 times harvested baseline concentrations makes 
practical the use of adult bone marrow stem cells in a spi[INVESTIGATOR_61680]. In a study by [CONTACT_405411]., they 
found a 95% successful spi[INVESTIGATOR_421028] [ADDRESS_531325] was 
Study #S16-[ZIP_CODE] Version 11JULY2024 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_421015], MD 
[ADDRESS_531326], the historical 
autograft fusion success rate ranges between 65-95%. 
These studies conclude that both BMP and BMAC mimic and supplement the body’s natural 
response to trauma by [CONTACT_421075]. BMAC contains many 
cell types, while BMP contains only one, the question of superiority between the two methods of 
bone healing/remodeling stimulation is unanswered. As BMAC is autologous, there are no 
immuno-rejection side-effects or concerns regarding disease transmission.  
 
Preliminary Data 
In an earlier study with unpublished results, 14 BMAC+allograft patients were compared to 3 
ICBG. This randomized series determined radiographic fusion in 92.9% of cases among the 
BMAC+allograft and ICBG cohorts, suggesting no difference in fusion efficacy among these 
grafts. This study did not identify any difference between lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_421029]+allograft during surgery, on the basis of patient-reported outcomes up to 1-
year follow-up and fusion grading. Only higher SF-[ADDRESS_531327]-operative. These preliminary results are 
important given the controversy surrounding effective use of interbody grafts, but are not decisive 
especially when, for many surgeons, the choice is between BMP and BMAC. 
Our hypothesis is that: 
For patients who undergo lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_421030], the outcomes in 
terms of pre-operative measures, intra-operative measures, and post-operative measures in the 
investigational group (BMAC + allograft) will be similar to the compared BMP group and control 
group at 24 months postoperatively. 
Study Objective 
To compare the efficacy of BMAC+allograft versus BMP versus autograft (control), we plan to 
pursue a prospective, blinded controlled study in which: BMAC+allograft or BMP or autograft 
will be randomized 1:1:1 ratio, respectively to certain patients undergoing a lumbar  fusion by 
[CONTACT_421076]. 
Study Design 
This study will be a prospective, randomized clinical study at a single-center, NYU Langone 
Medical Center. It is intended to compare and evaluate the efficacy of subjects who are either 
treated with (1) bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_5957] (BMAC) and allograft or (2) recombinant 
human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP) or (3) autograft (control) during lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_421031]. The clinical, radiographic, and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) 
outcomes will be assessed in operatively treated adult spi[INVESTIGATOR_421032].  
 
Sample Size Analysis

PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_421015], MD 
7 
 A power analysis was performed for sample size estimation, based on data from Bishop et al (N=132), 
comparing arthrodesis rate in autograft vs. allograft fusion groups[31]. In an effort to identify the number of 
patients needed in the current research project, a power analysis has been investigated with G*Power [IP_ADDRESS]: 
 Arthodesis rate one year post-operation (paired t-test): 
The effect size (ES) in this study was 0.4, considered to be low using Cohen's (1988) criteria. 
With an alpha = .05 and power = 0.80, the projected sample size needed with this effect size is 
approximately N = 23.
Thus, our proposed sample size of N=60 (with 20 patients per arm; effectively 40 for t-tests between groups) 
will be more than adequate for the main objective of this study and should also allow for expected attrition
Completion rate of enrolled patients in our protocol is estimated to be 85% based on standard clinical 
follow up rates for lumbar Spi[INVESTIGATOR_421033]. . Therefore, by [CONTACT_79323]

Sequenced and sealed envelopes or a similar randomization technology approach will be used. 
Given posterior, anterior and anterior-posterior surgical techniques will be randomly included in 
the three study arms, we anticipate equal stratification. However, if study arms show predominance 
to one surgical approach, attempt will be made to increase enrollment of patients of the unbalanced 
surgical approach.

process. One or more of the research team members will explain, in simple terms, the details about 
the outcome collection and the subject’s involvement.  
Patients must have the capacity to comprehend and give informed consent.  Patient will be given 
the opportunity to ask questions prior to signing the informed consent (ICF). Comprehension of

[ADDRESS_531342] and his/her family follow-up questions about their 
understanding of the study procedures and follow-up process after informed consent has been 
given. During this time frame and throughout the time period of the study, the research team will 
re-educate the patient on the study. Additionally, this will provide the patients with the opportunity 
to make a fully informed decision about their participation in the outcomes data collection, prior 
to signing the ICF. This will ensure that all subjects understand the nature of the outcomes data 
collection, the risks and benefits involved, and their commitment to complete all follow-up visits. 
Health information will be collected from participants who are a part of this research study. By 
[CONTACT_17317], participants will allow the primary investigator and researchers to use 
health information, but only to use it within this research. Information will only be used as 
explained in the consent form or when required by [CONTACT_2371].  
Patient participation will require 7 visits as per routine care : 1 screening visit (15 minutes to 
determine if patient is qualified for study), 1 pre-operative visit (1-2 hrs to gather preliminary 
information), and 5 follow up visits at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months 
(each requiring about 1 hour per visit).   
The patients will be made known that participation in the study will not affect the standard of care 
delivered by [CONTACT_473]. The risks of general anesthesia will be explained during the 
anesthesia consenting process as per standard of care. The use of BMP during lumbar  fusion is 
currently approved by [CONTACT_1622].  Autograft, Allograft and BMAC have been used at NYULMC in 
the field of orthopaedics for inducing bone growth for non-unions and osteonecrosis of the 
extremities and has been used for the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
Document of Consent, Consent Forms 
Documentation of ICF process will be completed by [CONTACT_384651]. Subjects will be 
provided a copy of the signed ICF. The original ICF with study documentation will be physically 
stored in a secured location at the NYU HJD Spi[INVESTIGATOR_421047]. Participation is entirely 
voluntary. Participants can withdraw at any time without consequences of any kind. Participation 
or withdrawal from the study will not affect the patient’s treatment in any way.  
Potential Benefits
The potential benefits to the subjects in this study are hypothesized to be similar in the [ADDRESS_531343] or 
complications associated with the usage of BMP. There may also not be any benefits present at all 
to the patient. However, from the patient’s participation in the study, there will be a better 
understanding of the efficacy of allograft and BMAC use during lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_421048].  
Adverse Events/Risks
Although BMP is a frequently performed surgical procedure with easy use, complications with 
BMP, as with all surgeries with and without BMP of this type, are common and well documented 
in literature including, but not limited to, tumorigenesis, infections, seroma formation, or 
osteolysis. As the use of BMP to augment spi[INVESTIGATOR_421049] a standard 
procedure, adverse events will be managed using standard surgical protocols.

[ADDRESS_531344], similar structural support, and lack of BMP associated complications. 
. In general, the use of autograft versus allograft should be balanced with donor site morbidity 
(pain, bleeding, infection) on the one hand, and the risk of pseudoarthrosis as well as the possibility 
of revision surgery on the other. 
The disadvantages for allograft utilization include a higher potential for transmission of disease or 
infection, unavailability in some countries, immunogenicity with an inflammatory response, 
slower incorporation, and possible graft collapse. Allograft cancellous bone invokes a larger 
inflammatory response when compared to cortical allograft bone due to the larger surface area 
available for an immune response. In addition, cortical allografts are incorporated more slowly and 
to a lesser degree prior to remodeling than other allograft bone. In general, allograft is incorporated 
slower and less completely with decreased vascularization and osteoconduction than its autograft 
counterpart. 
The safety of autologous bone marrow transplantation is quite good. Many surgeons now use bone 
marrow because of its biological value and low risk. One of the authors in the study by [CONTACT_421082]. (P. Hernigou) has clinical experience with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_421050] [ADDRESS_531345] Risks 
Studies involving BMAC and/or allograft have been completed in the past. The study by [CONTACT_421083], MD has shown positive results of using allograft with BMAC for spi[INVESTIGATOR_388428]. The 
investigators are board certified orthopaedic spi[INVESTIGATOR_421051]. For data collection, the research coordinator is knowledgeable in the field 
of orthopaedic care and clinical research. All personnel have completed CITI training and the 
investigators have a dedicated staff and nurse to attend to the patient’s medical and psychological 
needs if needed. If patients require medical monitoring, ancillary care, or equipment, patients will 
be able to seek care in case of an emergency at the NYU-HJD Immediate Care Center which is
open 24/7. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_208997], Mohamed Moawad, MPH, CRCC, will also be 
available to patients during regular office hours.
Investigation schedule and follow-up 
Data will be collected pre-operatively regarding individual patient demographics, radiographic 
images, laboratory values, and the surgical procedure to be performed. These data will be recorded 
onto a de-identified data collection sheet by [CONTACT_41314]. The patient data sheets will then be 
entered into a protected electronic database, while the data sheets will be stored as a back-up until 
the study is complete. Once the completed database is analyzed and summarized, the results will 
be presented to the involved participants without any identifiable patient information. A Delegation 
of Duties log will be prepared and maintained in the study regulatory binder.  
A separate surgeon and radiologist will be performing the radiographic analysis and an office 
medical assistant will have the patients fill out questionnaires and record any complications 
pertinent to the study. Follow-up will be the investigators’ routine follow-up, which is [ADDRESS_531346]-op.

All of the tests (i.e. physical evaluation and imaging components) will be performed as part of the 
standard of care. The patient may want to discuss this with his insurance carrier in advance. The 
patient will be responsible for any co-payments and/or deductibles for services rendered. 
The patient or his/her insurance company will be responsible for paying for the 1-year follow-up 
CT scan because it is part of standard care. Patients will have the option to refuse CT scan in which 
case they will be excluded from the primary data analysisbut will be part of the secondary analysis.

12.8 (MCID), given 90% power and alpha=0.05, we would need [ADDRESS_531349] to confirm normality of variables. Where deviated from 
normality, we will do the suitable transformations such as a box-cox transformation to approximate 
normality for the subsequent analyses. Missing data will be imputed when appropriate. The 
Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) will be used for all 
statistical analysis. 
 
Aim 1: Clinical Study 
This study will analyze the clinical and radiographic outcomes in terms of pre-operative measures, 
intra-operative measures, and post-operative measures followed-up for in the three groups.  
 
Primary Outcome Endpoint: As per the primary outcome measure, fusion status at [ADDRESS_531350]-operative time points will be compared between the 3 groups by [CONTACT_15914] t-
tests. Based on preliminary data, improvements are expected in these outcome measures: ODI 
from 33.42 (SD:6.22) to 26.75 (SD:8.19); SF-12 PCS from 29.00 (SD:6.05) to 31.42 (SD:6.05); 
SF-12 MCS from 31.42 (SD: 6.50) to 35.75 (SD: 13.82); NRS from 8.17 (SD: 1.27) to 5.93 (SD: 
1.90). Multivariate regression analysis, controlling for age, sex, race, and charlson comorbidity 
index, will be performed to determine the effect of treatment on reaching MCID values, as defined 
in Parker et al 2012.[2]

CT scans of the subject. The investigators will try to determine if the adverse 
event is related to the research itself or an isolated event using the above criteria.
o The research coordinator, Mohamed Moawad, will perform safety reviews 
(collecting adverse events, reviewing them, and reporting them). 
o Additionally, upon enrollment and treatment of 10th subject, data safety and 
monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_421060].

[ADDRESS_531353]’s condition has worsened (adverse event), and if determined by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_421061], the event will be reported by [CONTACT_10117].
o All adverse events identified are reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_208997]
-Plan for periodic or annual reporting of AEs
o The IRB will be notified of a serious adverse event and unanticipated adverse 
event within 24 hours. All other adverse events will be reported annually to the 
IRB at the time of continuation renewal. 
o All unanticipated adverse events related to the study will be reported to the IRB 
in an expedited manner if they are Grade 2 and above in severity. Unanticipated 
patient deaths are reportable within 7 days. The expedited report sent to other 
organizations can be copi[INVESTIGATOR_404892]. The investigator will continue to 
follow or obtain documentation of the resolution course of such an event. 
 
4. Privacy and Confidentiality 
- Case report forms and all other documentation collected by [CONTACT_421084]/assistant will not contain subject names. Each subject will be 
assigned a subject code. The subject code will consist of [ADDRESS_531354] interviews will be performed 
by [CONTACT_95002]/researchers or investigators at each clinical site. Data will be 
stored in individual subject binders and locked in a secure office and electronically on 
the secure REDCap system. Only approved research coordinators/investigators will 
have access to the data. 
 
5. Assessments 
- Safety reviews will be performed monthly by [CONTACT_236884] (the principal 
investigator). The monitoring entity will be responsible for determining the relationship 
of an adverse event and the treatment received. Since the PI [INVESTIGATOR_421062], he will be familiar with the subjects’ outcomes and patient 
histories, thereby [CONTACT_404915]. This plan allows for 
prompt detection of unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects. 
- Monitor the incidents of pseudarthrosis for both graft groups by [CONTACT_976] 
 
6. Criteria for Action 
- Subject stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_404894] [ADDRESS_531355] is unlikely to comply with the follow-up evaluation schedule  
- Study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_421063] a case of mortality. DSMB and IRB review will 
determine continuation or termination of study. 
- Study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_421063] a greater than normal rate of morbidity as 
determined by [CONTACT_236884]; the study subject will be un-blinded and the rates 
of morbidity will be observed for that subject to determine the cause. Acute vs. 
Subacute vs chronic morbidity complications vary in degree of prevalence, still greater

21 
 than 10 –15% complication rate will deviate from the literature anticipated (Hoffmann 
2013, Ajiboye 2016). Study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_421063] a greater prevalence of 
pseudarthrosis in the BMAC study group; Lumbar pseudarthrosis rates with use of 
BMP have been estimated to 6.4% in single center studies. (Kim 2013). Similar 
percentages can be deduced from reported lumbar arthrodesis rates in larger review 
studies. Use in lumbar fusions showed a 94% arthrodesis average rate for BMP-2, and 
85% average arthrodesis rate using bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (Chun 2015). For these 
reasons a pseudarthrosis rate of greater than 10 – 15% would warrant action.  
- Study should be stopped if there is a 10% reduction in fusion rates in the studied group 
relative to the control group which is the current "Gold Standard" of Iliac Crest graft. 
7. Communication of Data Safety Monitoring Reports to the IRB
-The IRB will be notified of a serious adverse event and unanticipated adverse 
event within 24 hours. All other adverse events will be reported annually to the 
IRB at the time of continuation renewal. 
-All unanticipated adverse events related to the study will be reported to the IRB in 
an expedited manner if they are Grade 2 and above in severity. Unanticipated 
patient deaths are reportable within 7 days. The expedited report sent to other 
organizations can be copi[INVESTIGATOR_404892]. The investigator will continue to follow 
or obtain documentation of the resolution course of such an event. 
Trial Organization 
This trial will be conducted at a single institution: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421064]. Surgeries will be conducted at NYU-HJD while patient

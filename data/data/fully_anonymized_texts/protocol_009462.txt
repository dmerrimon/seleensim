 1 INTRODUCTION  
 
Unintended pregnancies are a significant concern throughout the world and are often associated 
with adverse maternal and child outcomes .1,2 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_138959], unintended pregnancy 
remains a widespread problem, as an estimated 2.8 million unintended pregnancies occur annually in the US , representing 45% of all pregnancies. 
 
The 14% of women at risk who do not practice contraception at all, or who have gaps of a month or more during the year, account for 54% of all unintended pregnancies. According to rese arch 
conducted by [CONTACT_7698] (CDC), approximately 40% of women  surveyed after unintended birth who were not using contraception at the time of 
conception noted one of the following three  reasons for nonuse: did not expec t to have sex,  
worried about side effects of birth control, or male partner didn ’t want to use birth control 
(17.3%, 14.1%, and 8.0%, respectively).
[ADDRESS_157897] immediately, lacks systemic side effects, and is female controlled. This 
would be consistent with research indicating a preference by [CONTACT_138978]-acting, on-demand contraceptives that are easily rever sible.
3,4 
 Amphora
® contraceptive vaginal gel (Amphora) is a novel, non-hormonal, surfactant -free, 
contraceptive developed to have acidifying, bioadhesive, and viscosity- retaining properties to 
provide effective acidification of the male ejaculate in the vagina and to form a long- lasting layer 
of gel over the vaginal and cervical surfac es.5,6 As Amphora is non-hormonal, it may be  a viable 
option for women who are reluctant to use hormonal contraceptives due to side effects or for whom hormonal contraceptives are contraindicated, which represents approximately 13%-16% of the population.
7,8 Amphora is also intended to help fill a gap in the contraceptive landscape for 
women who prefer a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_1920], non-daily and/or on- demand contraception, experience 
allergy or sensitivity to nonoxynol- 9 (N-9), or do not want to rely on a partner’s collaboration. 
Compatibility studies  indicate that Amphora can safely be used concomitantly with barrier 
methods,9,10,11 such as diaphragms and condoms, which provides reassurance considering 
evidence suggesting  that some women prefer to use multiple types of contraceptives 
simultaneously.12 As there is no other method currently available that has all the unique 
characteristics of Amphora, it  will expand the contraceptive options currently available to 
women.  
 This Phase III study is designed  to further confirm  the safety and effectiveness of Amphora 
demonstrated in a previous Phase III study.

3.3 Clinical Study Period  
Each woman will participate until she has been  treated for seven  on-study menstrual cycles . The 
cycle in which enrollment occurs is Cycle 0 ( Figure 1). If the time from enrollment to the 
subject’s next menstrual period is ≥[ADDRESS_157902]’s seven study cycles will be Cycles 0 -6 
(Figure 1a). If the time from enrollment to the subject’s  next menstrual period is <[ADDRESS_157903]’s seven study cycles will be Cycles 1 -7 (Figure 1b) . The final visit to the clinical site will 
take place [ADDRESS_157904] occurred on- treatment and 
AMPHORA®  Protocol: AMP002  
Evofem, Inc.  Version 4  – [ADDRESS_157905] to follow up, attempts will be made to follow such pregnancies 
(up to three attempts followed by a certified letter). AEs considered to be  possibly related to 
study drug will be followed to resolution or, for chronic conditions, deemed stable, even if this occurs beyond the study period. The last electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) should be completed within two weeks of the final assessment.  
[ADDRESS_157906] those cycles 
replaced by [CONTACT_138981] a total of seven evaluable cycles. 
Subjects will be expected to attend five visits: Screening (Visit 1), Enrollment (Visit 2), Visit 3 (during the second study cycle), Visit 4 (during either the fifth or sixth study cycle), and Visit 5 (14 to 30 days after seventh study cycle) as described in Section 5.1. In addition, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_138982] 3 and 4 to monitor AEs, concomitant medications, sexual activity, use of backup contraception, compliance with use of the study drug and electronic diary (eDiary), need for an unscheduled visit, and confirmation of contact [CONTACT_3031]. In the event that the subject reports any significant gynecological symptoms or any symptoms indicative of a possible UTI, she will be asked to contact [CONTACT_138983]. During further unscheduled safety visits, the Investigator may perform a 
gynecological exam and appropriate laboratory tests, and provide appropriate treatment as 
necessary.  
An independent expert Pregnancy Review Committee will review all confirmed pregnancies. The Pregnancy Review Committee will determine if the pregnancy occurred on treatment (defined as date of conception between enrollment and <8 d ays after final study drug  use) or not 
on treatment (defined as date of conception prior to enrollment or ≥8 days following final study 
drug use), or whether there is insufficient information for adjudication. Subjects with an on-
treatment pregnancy will discontinue drug but remain in the study for follow-up.

4.1.3 Screen Failures 
Subjects who completed the informed consent process but do not meet all eligibility criteria 
within the  60-day screening period will be  screen failures. Screen failure subjects may be 
rescreened two additional times  at the Investigator’s discretion, following approval by [CONTACT_429] /PAREXEL . There must be a minimum of two  weeks between each rescreening. Each 
time a subject is rescreened, a new informed consent form ( ICF) must be signed. 
All screening procedures and laboratory tests (CBC, chemistry, urinalysis, urine culture, 
chlamydia, gonorrhea, urine pregnancy test) will be repeated upon rescreening. HIV test will not be repeated if the original test still falls within the [ADDRESS_157916] be registered  in the interactive web response system (IW RS). Upon 
rescreening, the subject will be assigned a new screening number in the IW RS. A link between 
the previous screening number and the new screening number will be created in the IW RS and 
the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  
If a blood sample must  be redrawn (e.g., due to sample handling problems, breakage or sample 
integrity ), this is not considered a rescreening.  
Further details regarding the procedure for rescreening may be found in the Site Reference 
Manual (SRM) .

 4.2 Informed Consent Process  
The principles of informed consent will be implemented according to the 1996 revision of the 
Declaration of Helsinki, ICH Consolidated GCP  (E6), and applicable FDA regulations. 
It is the Investigator 's responsibility to ensure that each subject is provided an explanation of the 
details contained in the Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to the individual signing  and dating 
the form certifying voluntary participation in the study. The I nvestigator will not undertake any 
eligibility testing for the study  until valid consent has been obtained. If  required by [CONTACT_1201] a 
witness (impartial observer to the informed consent process) must also sign  and date the I CF. 
The signed and dated ICF  must be retaine d by [CONTACT_138984]. The 
subject is to also receive a copy of th e ICF  after signatures by [CONTACT_21438]/her 
designees. 
4.[ADDRESS_157917] who provides informed consent at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) will be assigned a 
screening number by [CONTACT_8784]. The Investigator (or  designee) must ensure that the subject is 
eligible to participate in the study before enrollment and t he Coordinator must verify subject 
eligibility with the Investigator (or designee) prior to  enrollment and/or dispensing study drug.  
Study drug will be labeled with a unique code.  
Further d etails can be found in the IWRS User Manual. 
4.[ADDRESS_157918] application (e.g., if vaginal intercourse occurs more than once in a day). If more than one hour passes  before starting intercourse, an additional 
application of study gel must be applied. 
Subjects should be encouraged not to douche during the study; however, if douching does occur, 
the subject should wait at least six  hours after the last act of intercourse and should record the 
product used as a concomitant medication in the eD iary. Similarly, subjects should be advised 
not to use lubricants  or other vaginal preparations  before or du ring intercourse. If use does occur, 
it should be recorded in the eDiary and as a concomitant medication.  
4.5 Study  Drug Packaging and Storage 
The study drug will be provided in pre -filled  applicators. Each clinical site  will receive a supply 
sufficient for the anticipated number of study participants.

minimum of 1 carton of study drug containing 10 pre- filled applicators.  
Subjects should return all unused pre- filled applicators at each study visit; for used or partially 
used product, only the wrapper should be returned at each study visit . Return of these items will 
be recorded in the EDC system . The clinical site  must account for and properly document all 
study drug returned by [CONTACT_138985]. In order to receive additional shipments of study drug, a request from the clinical site  must be emailed or faxed to their study monitor or the 
designated contact.  
The Investigator is responsible for returning all unused study drug  to the Sponsor/ PAREXEL for 
disposal. Alternatively, unused study drug may be disposed of by [CONTACT_138986]/PAREXEL. The Investigator must verify that all unused drug supplies 
have been returned by [CONTACT_138987]’s possession.

Investigators will note the presence or absence of vulvar, vaginal , or c ervical findings  (as defined 
in Sect
ion 5.4.3), including epi[INVESTIGATOR_111100], or areas of obvious erythema; these will be 
assessed as ei
ther not present, mild, moderate, or severe; the presence or absence of bleeding, 
petechiae, or sloughing will also be recorded on the gynecological exam eCRF  and reported as 
an AE  if considered by [CONTACT_63033] a clinically significant change from baseline, 
defined as an at least one level increase in severit y of the finding from baseline.

unscheduled safety visits, the Investigator may  perform a gynecological exam and appropriate 
laboratory tests and provide appropriate treatment as necessary. Subjects should be discouraged from any self -medication with vaginal products; rather , they should visit the clinical site  for 
assessment and treatment. Similarly, subjects should be discouraged, but not prohibited, from seeking treatment for suspected UTIs or other vaginal infections at facilities other than the clinical s ite. 
AMPHORA®  Protocol: AMP002  
Evofem, Inc.  Version 4  – [ADDRESS_157926] should be discontinued, the Treatment Exit procedures (as detailed in Section  5.1.4) will be performed and the subject will be discontinued from the study. In addition, 
if at any time during the study a subject misses her period or suspects that she may be pregnant, 
she should cal l the clinical site  to schedule a urine pregnancy test.  
5.[ADDRESS_157927]’s 
contraceptive use within the past year will also be recorded at these study visits.  
The use of concomitant medications and health products will also be queried in the eDiary, at Visits 2-[ADDRESS_157928] be recorded in the EDC system . 
Subjects should be encouraged not to douche during the study; however, if douching does occur, the subject should wait to douche until at least six hours after the last act of intercourse and 
should record the product used as a concomitant medication in the eD iary. Similarly, subjects 
should be advised not to use  any lubricants or vaginal preparations before or during intercourse. 
If use does occur, it should be recorded in the eDiary and as a concomitant medication . 
5.[ADDRESS_157929] all AEs (both serious and non- serious) 
derived by [CONTACT_19702], unsolicited reports of subjects, by [CONTACT_4171], and by [CONTACT_139001], e.g., "How have you felt since I last saw you?" 
5.4.2 Definitions  
For the purposes of this study, an AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not it is considered related.  
AMPHORA®  Protocol: AMP002  
Evofem, Inc.  Version 4  – 01 Nov 2017 
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   Page 36 of 65 
 All AEs, including intercurrent illnesses, occurring during the study will be documented in the 
EDC system. Illnesses that  existed before entry into the study will not be considered AEs unless 
they worsen during the treatment period. All AEs, regardless of the source of identification  (e.g., physical examination, laboratory assessment, reported by [CONTACT_1130]), must be documented. 
Pre-existing conditions will be recorded in the EDC system on the appropriate page (e.g., 
Medical History ) 
AE data should be collected from enrollment until Visit 5 (14 -30 days after the seventh study 
cycle ) or early termination from the study . Those events that occur between the Screening Visit 
and enrollment will be analyzed as medical history . A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) will be 
defined as an AE that begins or that worsens in severity after at least one dose of study drug has 
been administered.  All AEs considered at least possibly related to study drug will be followed 
until resolution or, for chronic conditions, until deemed stable. 
5.4.3 Assessment of Adverse Events 
Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_139002], intensity, and causality using the 
following definitions: 
Seriousness  
A serious AE (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening; this means that the patient is at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138964]. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious and 
whether expedited reporting is appropriate. 
Intensity  
Investigators should assess the severity of AEs according to Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events ( CTCAE)  version 4.03. In general, CTCAE severity grades are:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated 
AMPHORA®  Protocol: AMP002  
Evofem, Inc.  Version 4  – 01 Nov 2017 
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   Page 37 of 65 
 • Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting  age-
appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (Instrumental ADL refer to 
preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.) 
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threa tening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL (Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.) 
• Grade 4: Life -threaten ing consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE 
Causality  
The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study drug and the AE and record that assessment in the EDC system. The most likely cause of an AE (e .g., concomitant 
disease, concomitant medication, other) will be indicated in the EDC system with details of the concomitant disease or medication or other cause.  
The causal relationship of the AE to study drug will be described per World Health Organization (WHO) Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) causality categorie s
15: 
• Certain/Definite : 
o Event or laboratory test abnormality, with plausible time relationship to drug intake  
o Cannot be explained by [CONTACT_19699] 
o Response to withdrawal plausible (pharmacologically, pathologically) 
o Event definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically (i.e., an objective and specific medical disorder or a recognized pharmacological phenomenon) 
o Rechallenge satisfactory  
• Probable/Likely:  
o Event or laboratory test abnormality, with plausible time relationship to drug intake  
o Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs  
o Response to withdrawal clinically reasonable  
o Rechallenge not required  
• Possible :  
o Event or laboratory test abnormality, with plausible time relationship to drug intake  
o Could also be explained by [CONTACT_19699] 
o Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear 
• Unlikely : 
o Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake that makes a 
relationship improbable (but not impossible)

• Not assessable:  
o Report sugg esting an adverse reaction  
o Cannot be judged because information is insufficient or contradictory 
o Data cannot be supplemented or verified

 Genitourinary Side Effects  
Genitourinary ( GU) side effects (including vaginal burning, vaginal itching, vaginal pain, and 
other unexpected vaginal symptoms) will be collected in the eDiary each time the study drug is 
used and will be recorded at AEs . Subjects will note the time of drug administration , time of 
sexual intercourse  and if they had any side effect  (including severity, duration, and resolution).  
Unexpected vaginal bleeding or spotting will be recorded as AE s; however, expected menstrual-
related bleeding and/or spotting will not. 
Vulvar, Vaginal, or Cervical Side Effects 
An adaptation of the Division of AIDS ( DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and 
Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 2.0, Addendum 1 – Female Genital Grading Table for Use in 
Microbicide Studies  will be used by [CONTACT_139003], 
vaginal or cervical findings noted during the gynecologic exam and determine if they are 
considered significant, as defined as at least one grade increase from baseline.  These should  be 
reported as AEs.  The Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies was 
developed for use in protocols involving topi[INVESTIGATOR_138965].  Although developed specifically for  microbicide studies, it is  applicable to other protocols 
as well to ensure data consistency across sites.

 Recording Adverse Events  
AE reporting will extend from enrollment until Visit 5 (14- 30 days after the seventh study cycle) . 
AEs occurring after Visit  [ADDRESS_157931] report any SAEs to PAREXEL Medical  Services within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event. 
The Investigator and the Sponsor /PAREXEL will review each SAE report and the 
Sponsor/PAREXEL will evaluate the seriousness and the causal relationship of the event to 
study treatment. In addition, the Sponsor /PAREXEL will evaluate the expectedness according to 
the Investigator Brochure. Based on the assessment of the event, a decision will be made 
concerning the need for further action. 
All SAEs will be recorded from enrollment until Visit 5. SAEs  occurring after Visit  [ADDRESS_157932] be reported only if they are considered (in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] ) causally related to the investigational drug.  
Clinical site s should complete the SAE form and fax the documents to PAREXEL Medical 
Services using the PAREXEL SAE fax number below: 
([PHONE_3128] 
or 
Complete  the SAE report form and submit it to PAREXEL Me dical Services via email using the

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   Page 42 of 65 
 the study. It is the responsibility of the clinical site s to als o report all protocol 
deviations/ violations to their IRB  as required  under their IRB approval.  
6.2 Protocol Approval and Amendment  
Before the start of the study, the study protocol and/or other relevant documents must  be 
approved by [CONTACT_2717]. The site must document that all ethical and legal requirements have been 
met before the first subject is enrolled in the study.  
This protocol is to be followed exactly. To alter the protocol, amendments must be written, 
receive approval from the Sponsor (and in many cas es the FDA) , and receive IRB approval prior 
to implementation as appropriate. Amendments cannot be implemented until the investigator is officially notified of the change by [CONTACT_1034]/PAREXEL. All amendments will be distributed 
to all investigational sit es, with appropriate instructions for implementation . 
6.3 Confidentiality  
All study findings and documents are confidential. The Investigator and members of his/her research team must not disclose such information without prior written approval from the Sponsor /PAREXEL . 
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. During screening and after enrollment, coded subject numbers will be used to identify subjects in the EDC system and in 
other documents submitted to PAREXEL, and on all laboratory specimens in order to maintain subject confidentiality. Documents not to be submitted to PAREXEL that identify the subject 
(e.g., the signed ICF ) must be maintained in confidence by [CONTACT_737].

prematurely discontinued if she fa ils to remain in the study for seven on- study menstrual cycles 
and returns for Visit [ADDRESS_157938]  be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• Withdrawal of consent 
• Emergence of condition(s) such that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], continuation in the study would negatively impact the health of the subject or would jeopardize the validity of the data collected  (e.g., development of a condition that would have prevented 
her entry into the study according to the inclusion or exclusion criteria that could affect the study data) 
• Any confirmed STI (other than HPV or trichomoni asis) 
AMPHORA®  Protocol: AMP002  
Evofem, Inc.  Version 4  – 01 Nov 2017 
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   Page 43 of 65 
 • Subject lost to foll ow-up 
• If subject stops using study drug as her method of contraception 
• Study terminated ( Section  6.5) 
Subjects may be discontinued prematurely from treatment for other reasons at the Investigator ’s 
discretion . Investigators considering subject discontinuation should contact [CONTACT_429] /PAREXEL  to discuss the specific case prior to withdrawal of the subject.  
In all instances of premature discontin uation, t he reason will be recorded in the EDC system . If 
withdrawal from the study is due to an AE , this information will also  be recorded in the EDC 
system . In addition, a ll subjects who terminate early from the study will be asked to undergo the 
Treatment Exit Visit procedures (S ection  5.1.4) regardless of the reason for discontinuation.  
Every effort must be made to follow up with subjects who terminate with a study drug- related 
AE(s)  to determine the outcome of the AE(s) .  
Subject Discontinuation Due to Non-Adherence 
Due to the risk of non- adherence -related pregnancy, subject discontinuation should be 
considered for non-adherence (unless a specific reason is given by [CONTACT_139006]) . Investigators considering subject discontinuation for the following 
reasons should contact [CONTACT_1034] /PAREXEL  to discuss the specific case prior to withdrawal of 
the subject.  
1. Subjects with repeated failure over the course of one cycle to enter eDiary data, such that 
assessments of study medication compliance, sexual activity,  and use of backup 
contraception are not possible. 
2. Subjects missing >50% doses/month for two consecutive months by [CONTACT_6270]- report in eDiary . 
3. If an enrolled subject misses a scheduled appointment, she should be contact[CONTACT_11252] 
[ADDRESS_157939] to respond, the clinical site should make additional attempt(s) to contact 
[CONTACT_423]. If the subject is not reached within two additional business days, a certified letter must be sent asking the subject to contact [CONTACT_977] . If the subject fails to respond 
within [ADDRESS_157940] ed as the date of 
discontinuation. The certified letter receipt will be filed with the Investigator’s copy of the subject’s source document. If the subject re- contacts the clinical site  prior to being 
discontinued, and extenuating circumstances exist, the subject may be allowed to continue in the study with Sponsor /PAREXEL  approval. 
4. For subjects with the following, the Investigator should discuss the specific circumstances leading to the event with the subject and Sponsor /PAREXEL : 
• Two consecutive cycles wit h no sexual activity 
• Two cons ecutive cycles with use of back up contraception 
AMPHORA®  Protocol: AMP002

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   Page 44 of 65 
 6.5 Premature Termination of the Study  
If the Investigator or the Sponsor /PAREXEL  become s aware of conditions or events that suggest 
the study poses a possible hazard to subject s, the study may be terminated after appropriate 
consultation among the relevant parties. The study may also be terminated early at the Sponsor’s 
discretion for reasons other than subject safety . 
Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
• The discovery of a significant or unacceptable risk to the subject s enrolled in the study. 
• Failure to enroll subjects at an acceptable rate.  
• A decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of the study drug. 
6.6 Pregnancy Determination /Pregnancy Review Committee  
If urine pregnancy testing performed at the clinical site  during post- enrollment  scheduled or 
unscheduled visits is positive, samples for serum quantitative β- hCG will be collected and sent 
for assessment by  [CONTACT_139007], preferably during the same study visit.  Pelvic u ltrasound (transvaginal if <12 
weeks estimated gestation)  will be performed as promptly as possible, preferably the same day as 
the positive urine pregnancy test is identified. The study drug must be discontinued immediately upon confirmation of a pregnancy, and the subject will remain in the study for pregnancy assessments. 
At enrollment, if the urine pregnancy t est is negative and the serum β-hCG is borderline or 
positive, then the participant must be discontinued from the study and the reason for discontinuation will be protocol deviation, no pregnancy assessments as described below will be performed as part of the study, the pregnancy will not be followed, and the pregnancy will not be assessed by [CONTACT_139008].  
Repeat evaluations (e.g., repeat ultrasound if initial ultrasound done prior to presence of gestational sac and/or crown rump length for dating) will be done as necessary to increase the accuracy of the determination of the estimated date of conception. Subjects who become pregnant while participating in th e study should not be discontinued and, for those who choose to 
no longer participate or are lost to follow up, attempts should be made to continue to follow the pregnancy (up to three attempts followed by a certified letter), unless the Sponsor /PAREXEL  has 
determined that sufficient information is available or will not become available.  
Any subject who reports a positive home pregnancy test must be evaluated at the site as soon as possible (e.g., the same day ) for serum pregnancy testing, pelvic examination , and pelvic 
ultrasound (transvaginal if estimated gestational age is <12 weeks at the time of the visit). 
An independent expert Pregnancy Review Committee will review all confirmed pregnancies. 
Details of the membership and responsibilities of the Pregnancy Review Committee are defined in the Pregnancy Review Committee Charter.  The Pre gnancy Review Committee will determine 
if the pregnancy occurred on- treatment (defined as date of conception between enrollment to <8 
AMPHORA®  Protocol: AMP002  
Evofem, Inc.  Version 4  – 01 Nov 2017 
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   Page 45 of 65 
 days after final study drug  use) or not on- treatment  (defined as date of conception prior to 
enrollment or after ≥8 days f ollowing final study drug use), or whether there is insufficient 
information for adjudication. 
For confirmed pregnancies, the date of conception will be assessed from the following: 
• First trimester transvaginal ultrasound (considered the most accurate; lat er ultrasounds 
will not be used for redating) 
• Estimate based on pelvic and/or abdominal examination or pregnancy outcome 
• eDiary information (e.g., last menstrual period and sexual activity) 
• Quantitative β-hCG determination  
• Urine hCG (date of last negative and first positive)  
• Investigator estimation i n the absence of above criteria  
Subjects who become pregnant during the on- treatment period will be  instructed to immediately 
stop use of study product, informed of pregnancy options, and referred for appropriate care. 
Subjects who become pregnant while participating in the study will be continued to be followed. 
If they are lost to follow -up, then attempts will be made to contact [CONTACT_139009]. 
Reports of pregnancy ou tcome will be requested by [CONTACT_139010]. Pregnancy outcome data will include the rates of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and live preterm and full- term births. If a subject has a spontaneous abortion or ectopi c pregnancy 
this will not be considered as an AE or SAE unless it meets one of the SAE criteria indicated in 
Section  5.4.3. In addition, congenital malformations and anomalies will be recorded and 
summarized.  
[ADDRESS_157941] s’ source documentation (i.e., medical records ). 
The Investigator and Sub-I nvestigators will allow representatives from the Sponsor/ PAREXEL  
direct access to all eCRFs, source documents, and corresponding portions of the medical records for each participant at mutually convenient times for  periodic review during the study and after 
the study has been completed . The monitoring visits provide the opportunity to: 
• Initiate the clinical site . 
• Evaluate the progress of the study. 
• Verify the accuracy and completeness of the eCRFs /EDC system . 
• Ensure that all pro tocol requirements, applicable local  regulations, and Investigator s’ 
obligations are being fulfilled. 
• Resolve any inconsistencies in the study records.  
• Close out the study at the clinical site .  
AMPHORA®  Protocol: AMP002  
Evofem, Inc.  Version 4  – [ADDRESS_157942] operating 
procedures ( SOPs ), GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements. If an audit is performed, 
the clinical site  must provide the auditors with direct access to all relevant records and 
documentation related to the study. 
8 DATA MANAGEMENT  
8.1 Data base Management and Quality Control 
All data generated by [CONTACT_139011]. Data from external sources (such as laboratory data) will be 
imported into the database by [CONTACT_779] . Once the clinical data have been submitted to the central 
server at the independent data center , changes to the data fields wil l be captured in an audit trail. 
The reason for change, the name [CONTACT_27501], together with the time 
and date will be logged to provide an audit trail.  
If additional changes are needed  or questions arise , PAREXEL  will raise a query in the EDC 
system. The appropriate staff at the clinical site  will answer queries sent to the Investigator. The 
name [CONTACT_95904], and time and date stamp will be captured to 
provide an audit trail. Once all source data verification is complete and all queries are closed, the monitor will freeze the eCRF page.  
The specific procedures to be used for data entry and query resolution using the EDC system will be provided to the clinical site  in a training manual. In addition, clinical site  personnel will 
receive training on the EDC system.  
8.[ADDRESS_157943] ’s medical records. 
Measurements for which source documents are usually available include laboratory assessments.  
The original EDC entries for each subject may be checked against source documents at the clinical site  during a monitoring vi sit or audit. 
After review by [CONTACT_25007], completed EDC entries will be forwarded to PAREXEL. Instances of missing or uninterpretable data will be discussed with t he Investigator for resolution.  
8.3 Data Collection  
The Investigators (and appropriately authorized staff) will be given access to an online web-based EDC system. This system is specifically designed for the collection of the clinical data in electronic format. Access and right to the EDC system will be carefully controlled and configured according to each individual’s role throughout the study. In general, only the Investigator and authorized staff will be able to enter data and make corrections in the EDC 
system.  
AMPHORA®  Protocol: AMP002

 • AEs 
• Pregnancy outcome 
Exploratory 
• Subject satisfaction  
• Sexual satisfaction  
• Pregnancy intendedness 
• Dosing time deviations for study drug- associated pregnancies  
9.2 Sample Size  
The sample size determination assumes the following:  
• Study drug pregnancy percentage: 16.5% 
• 26.5% of subjects fail to qualify for the primary efficacy analysis population 
• Of the subjects that qualify for the primary efficacy analysis population, the average 
number of evaluable efficacy cycles per subject: 3.17  
• Exponential hazard for:  
o Pregnancy rate first 6 months: 16.5% 
o Drop out month 1: 10% 
o Drop out months 2-6: 38% 
With 1349 participants aged 18 through 35 years (inclusive), the study will have 90% power to 
ensure that the upper limit of the 95% CI of the cumulative seven- cycle pregnancy rate is less 
than or equal to 21% . The expected number of completers is [ADDRESS_157946] populations will be created:  
• Intent-to-t reat (ITT): All subjects enrolled into the s tudy.  
• Safet y population: ITT subjects who administer the study drug at least on ce  
• Modified i ntent -to-treat (MITT): S ubjects must  meet requirements 1, 2, and 
[ADDRESS_157947] one of requirement 4 or requirement 5 to be included in the 
MITT analysis population:

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   Page 49 of 65 
 1. Between 18 to 35 years of age (inclusive) at enrollment 
2. Had at least one report of pregnancy status after being enrolled; subjects with a 
positive serum pregnancy test at enrollment will not be included. 
3. ITT subjects whose diaries indicate they had at least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_138968]  (also referred as “Typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] -Use”)  
4. Had at least one cycle of eD iary without any backup contraception or EC 
5. Became pregnant and the pregnancy had a conception date that occurred between 
enrollment and <8  days after  final  study drug use 
• Efficacy -evaluable (EE): A subset of the MITT population that includes only those 
subjects whose diaries indicate that they used the study drug correctly for every act of 
intercourse for at least one menstrual c ycle (also referred as “Perfect- Use” or 
“Per Protocol”). Cycles in which the study drug was used incorrectly for one or more 
coital acts will be removed, and the correct use cycles will be compressed to provide 
contiguous cycles of correct use.   
The MITT is the primary population for analysis of efficacy. Analyses in the EE population 
will be considered exploratory only. 
9.[ADDRESS_157948] taken during the active study 
treatment period. Pre -trial medications include any medications taken within 60 days of 
enrollment, and for one year in the case of contraceptives. The number and pe rcentage of 
subjects using medications, as captured on the Concomitant Medication e CRF Form, will be 
tabulated for the safety  population. There will be separate tables for pre -trial and concomitant 
medications. Subjects taking a medication more than once will be  only counted once for that 
medication.

 9.8 Analyses of Pregnancy Experience  
9.8.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the seven -cycle cumulative pregnancy rate as calculated using 
the KM method. The KM estimate and its 95% CI (based on  Greenwood’s method) of the seven-
cycle cumulative pregnancy probability of women in the MITT population will be calculated.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Derivation of the Primary Variable 
The primary variable is the number of cycles from enrollment to the first pregnancy within 
seven  cycles, which will be derived in the following steps:  
• Imputing the missing dates of cycles: I f the eDiary  has partial dates for the start/end of a 
cycle, then the dates will be imputed to be a full date (when possible) based on the 
start/end dates of cycles that occurred before and after that cycle with partial dates. If 
multiple cycles in a row occur with partial start/end dates,  then it will be assumed the 
cycles were equal length in order to determine the imputed start/end dates of the cycle.  
• Determining the evaluable cycles: Cycles must  meet all conditions given below to be 
considered evaluable cycles:  
o Cycles 0-[ADDRESS_157949] 21 days prior to the start of 
her next menses, or C ycles 1 -7 for subjects who are enrolled in less than 21 days 
prior to the start of her next menses ;  
o Cycles that are indicated by [CONTACT_139013]; 
o Cycles with length within the range of [ADDRESS_157950] of intercourse during that cycle.  
• Compressing the evaluable cycles: Evaluable cycles will be compressed to form 
contiguous evaluable cycles for each subject sequentially. 
• Determining the date of conception:  
o The Pregnancy Review Committee will review all confirmed pregnancies and 
determine if the pregnancy occurred on- treatment (defined as date of 
conception between enrollment to <[ADDRESS_157951] use) or not 
on‑treatment (defined as date of conception prior to enrollment o r after 7 days 
AMPHORA®  Protocol: AMP002  
Evofem, Inc.  Version 4  – [ADDRESS_157952] use), or whether there is insufficient information 
for adjudication. 
For confirmed pregnancies, the date of conception will be assessed from the 
following: 
 First trimester transvaginal  ultrasound (considered the most accurate; 
later ultrasounds will not be used for redating) 
 Estimate based on pelvic and/or abdominal examination or pregnancy 
outcome 
 eDiary information (e.g., last menstrual period and sexual activity) 
 Quantitative β-hCG d etermination  
 Urine hCG (date of last negative and first positive)  
 Investigator estimation in the absence of above criteria  
• Determining of censoring for cycles to pregnancy: Subjects will be censored from 
analysis at the earliest of:  
o The estimated date of c onception that occurred between enrollment and <[ADDRESS_157953] date at which pregnancy status was known  
o The conclusion of her seventh cycle on-treatment (up to a total of 245 days [or 294 days for the sensitivity analysis, allowing a cycle length range of 21 to 
42 days]) 
9.8.2 Secondary Analysis 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis as Measured by [CONTACT_138969]: The Pearl Index and its 95% CI for 
the MITT population will be calculated. The Pearl Index will be calculated as the percentage of 
the total number of pregnancies versus the total number of days exposed . The 95% CI will be 
calculated using normal approximation. 
9.8.[ADDRESS_157954] to the Cycle Range:  The primary analysis will be repeated with 
the cycle length expanded from 21-[ADDRESS_157955] to Sexual Intercourse:  To evaluate the 
effect of the dosing time with respect to sexual intercourse, subgroup analyses for the primary 
analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_139014]®  Protocol: AMP002  
Evofem, Inc.  Version 4  – [ADDRESS_157956] to sexual intercourse: < 1 hour, < 1.5 hour, < 2 hours, <2.5 
hours, and all cycles (without respect to dosing time).  
Sensitivity Analysis with Respect to Completers and Non- completers: To evaluate differences 
between completers and non -completers the primary analysis will be repeated for just completers. 
A completer is defined as a woman who becomes pregnant within 7 -cycles (inclusive) or who 
completes the 7 cycles with no pregnancy. 
9.9 Safety Parameters  
The safety  population will be used for all safety summaries. All safety data will be summarized 
descriptively.  
9.9.1 Incidence of Adverse Events  
The number (percentage) of subjects with at least one AE will be presented in a frequency table 
by [CONTACT_139015] “preferred” term. A  similar summary will be 
created for SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug use . Summaries will also be 
presented by [CONTACT_139016].  
9.9.[ADDRESS_157957] s exual satisfaction  will be summarized using 
frequency and percentage.  
9.10.2  Pregnancy Intendedness  
Pregnancy intendedness scale results and change from baseline will be summarized descriptively.  
9.11 Protocol Deviations 
Deviations from the protocol, including violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be assessed in cooperation with the Sponsor and summarized. Subjects whose diaries indicate that they used the assigned study drug incorrectly for every act of intercourse for every menstrual 
cycle will be excluded from the EE population. Cycles in which the study drug was used 
incorrectly for one or more coital acts will be removed, and the correct use cycles will be compressed to provide contiguous cycles of correct use.

Project IntroductionI.1Project to be reviewed by:[CONTACT_1744]-01I.2Project Title:The effects of [ADDRESS_454243] current stimulation combined with gait and balance training inpeople with multiple sclerosisI.3Short Title (optional):Cerebellar tDCS, gait and balance training in PwMSI.4Provide a short summary of the purpose and procedures of the study proposed in this IRB application.DO NOT include information on studies not proposed in this application.Use LAY terminology only. This must be easily understandable by [CONTACT_364448].DO NOT cut and paste technical abstracts from funding applications that may not be understood by [CONTACT_364449].The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)combined with gait or balance training on glucose uptake in the leg muscles as well as gait and balanceperformance. We will conduct tDCS or SHAM followed by [CONTACT_364450] 9 days. We will evaluategait and balance with well-established functional tasks and changes in glucose uptake with PET-FDG imaging.I.5Specify your research question(s), study aims or hypotheses (do not indicate "see protocol")Our research question is whether tDCS combined with gait and balance training can improve gait and balanceperformance as well as increase glucose uptake symmetry in the leg muscles of people with multiple sclerosis. Wehypothesize that gait, balance, and glucose uptake symmetry will improve in both groups that received training(gait or balance) combined with tDCS compared to the groups that only receive training (sham tDCS). Moreover,we hypothesize that the greatest improvements will be seen in the gait and tDCS group.I.6Background and signiﬁcance and/or Preliminary studies related to this project.(do not indicate "see protocol")Many people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) have decreased balance (1,2) and postural control(3), gait deﬁcits(4),and a high frequency of falls(5). High fall rates and mobility impairments pose a signiﬁcant risk to theindependence and quality of life of PwMS(8,9). Therefore, effective interventions to improve gait, balance andpostural control are urgently needed to decrease the frequency of falls in PwMS. Gait and balance training has beendemonstrated to signiﬁcantly improve postural control and gait in PwMS (10,11). However, a standardized protocolfor balance interventions has not been established. However, the cumulative evidence shows that only smallimprovements in walking ability are associated with exercise training short-term and the long-term effects areambiguous (13). One possible treatment modality to amplify the effects of gait balance training is transcranialdirect current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive means to increase cortical excitability and potentially prime thebrain for task speciﬁc learning(14). The cerebellum plays a vital role in balance and posture and may be animportant target structure for tDCS studies seeking to improve gait and balance (14-17). Studies have shown thatanodal cerebellar tDCS is effective in improving balance control in older adults with high fall risk(18) and patientswith chronic stroke(19). However, the most effective tDCS intensity and the duration of the effects on gait balancecontrol has not been established(20,21).

Each subject will attend a total of [ADDRESS_454247] approximately 45 minutes. The duration of the baseline(Session 2) and 24-hour post-intervention session (Session 12) will be approximately 3 hours. The ctDCS and gaittraining sessions (Sessions 3 – 11) will last approximately 1.[ADDRESS_454248]-interventionsessions (Sessions 13 and 14, respectively) will be approximately one hour. During the initial session, subjects will beconsented and complete strength testing to objectively determine the more-affected leg. Additionally, during Session 1subjects will become familiar with treadmill walking and determine a self-selected speed for subsequent testing sessions.During the baseline session (Session 2), subjects will 1) complete the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)63, 2) undergo awhole-body FDG/PET scan after 20 minutes of treadmill walking at their self-selected speed, 3) perform the FunctionalGait Assessment (FGA), 4) Timed 25-Foot Walk Test (T25WT), 5) Berg Balance Scale (BBS), 6) static posturography,and 7) the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) while wearing inertial sensors. The following [ADDRESS_454249] of the same testing battery as Session 2. Long term effects (2- and 4-weeks post-intervention) will be assessed with the 1) FSS questionnaire, 2) FGA, 3) T25FW, 4) BBS, 5) staticposturography, and 6) the 6MWT during Sessions 13 and 14.STRENGTH TESTING: Strength testing will be performed in a sitting position on an isokinetic dynamometer (CSMi,Stoughton, MA, [LOCATION_003]). The subject will be secured with Velcro bands to help isolate the knee joint and the range ofmotion will be set between 100° and 0° of ﬂexion. Strength testing will begin with a 15-repetition warm up of the kneeextensors and ﬂexors at 60º/s (concentric/concentric). After a [ADDRESS_454250], 3 sets of 1 maximal effort isometriccontraction of the knee extensors and ﬂexors will be performed at 65° and 30°, respectively, with &#8805; [ADDRESS_454251] of 3 sets of 1 maximal effort knee extension and ﬂexion (60°/s,concentric/concentric) with &#8805; [ADDRESS_454252] torque obtained from a given muscle group in any of the strength testing conditions (isometric or isokinetic) willbe used to verify leg dominance.FUNCTIONAL GAIT ASSESSMENT (FGA): The FGA is a valid measure of walking balance and consists of 10challenging tasks, such as walking with a narrow base of support (i.e., tandem stance), walking backwards, and walkingwith eyes closed. Each item is graded from 0 (severe impairment) to 3 (normal performance), with a maximum score of3068. The minimal clinical important difference (MCID) for the FGA has not been established in PwMS. However, inother neurological populations, a MCID of 4-[ADDRESS_454253] (T25FW): The T25FW test resembles relevant daily life situations, such as walkingacross a signaled intersection, is well-established and has very good psychometric properties. In a cordoned-off hallway,subjects will be instructed to walk as fast as possible between two points separated by [ADDRESS_454254] time it takes to complete the 25-foot walk will be the main outcome variable. Gait characteristicswill also be recorded using six inertial sensors (OPAL inertial motion units [APDM, Portland, OR, [LOCATION_003]]) located on thechest/sternum, each wrist and foot, and on the lower back (5th lumbar). A 20% decrease in the time it takes to completethe T25FW has been established as a signiﬁcant change in PwMS.BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS): The BBS is a valid and reliable assessment of balance during static (e.g., standingwith eyes closed) and dynamic (e.g., completing a 360-degree turn) conditions. A cut-off score of 44 has been establishedas a criterion to identify PwMS with a high fall risk. Furthermore, it has been shown that the minimal clinically importantdifference (MCID) for the BBS in PwMS is 3 points.STATIC POSTUROGRAPHY: Static posturography will be examined on a Balance Plate (Balance Tracking Systems,San Diego, CA, [LOCATION_003]). Participants will stand on both ﬁrm (i.e., the force plate) and compliant (i.e., a 6 cm Airex BalancePad Elite 76 [Airex AG, Sins, Switzerland] placed on the force plate) surfaces with their eyes open and with their eyesclosed for one minute each. The addition of a foam pad increases the difﬁculty of maintaining balance by [CONTACT_364463]. The center of pressureaverage movement velocity in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions and the area of an ellipse thatencapsulates 95% of the 2D area explored will be the primary outcomes.6-MINUTE WALK TEST (6MWT): The 6MWT is considered the “gold standard” for a long walking test ininterventional research. The subjects will be led to a cordoned-off hallway to perform the walk. Subjects will beinstructed to walk as far as possible between two points separated by 30 m for 6 min. Gait characteristics and distancewalked will be calculated and recorded using six inertial sensors (OPAL inertial motion units [APDM, Portland, OR,[LOCATION_003]]) located on the chest/sternum, each wrist and foot, and on the lower back (5th lumbar).

Page 16 of 20https://hawkirb.research.uiowa.edu/hawkirb/summary/projects.page?mode=pf&OID=70618871GAIT TRAINING: The gait training protocol is aimed to improve walking velocity, balance, fatigability, and cognitivefunctions during motor dual tasks. This protocol has been used previously by [CONTACT_364464]. (2018, 2020) and resulted insigniﬁcant improvements in fatigability, speed, and mobility with a moderate improvement in balance measures. Thetreadmill training will be performed without body weight support, but subjects may hold onto handrails for balancesupport if necessary. The exercise intensity will be based on the participant’s Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) on a scalefrom 0-[ADDRESS_454255] of three different walking bouts: 1) Aerobic bout (minutes 0-12): preferredwalking speed for the ﬁrst 3 minutes, then the treadmill speed and slope will be increased as necessary to maintain thedesired RPE range until the end of minute 12. RPE will be maintained between 5-6 and heart rate will not exceed 80% ofage-predicted maximum heart rate. 2) Dual-task phase (minutes 13-22): preferred walking speed will be maintained whilethe participant completes motor dual-task activities such as changing walking motions (e.g., long steps, walking on toes,and knee lifts), head rotations, and walking with eyes closed. 3) Second aerobic phase (minutes 23-34): increase inwalking speed and slope as necessary to maintain the desired RPE until the end of minute 31. RPE will be kept between5-6 and heart rate will remain below 80% of age-predicted maximum heart rate. The last three minutes will consist ofwalking at their preferred speed.BALANCE TRAINING: The balance training protocol will be based on previous work by [CONTACT_364465]. (2011) and willinclude a variety of both static and dynamic balance exercises on both compliant (i.e., foam and trampoline) and ﬁrmsurfaces46. Example exercises include performing head rotations and ball catching and tossing during walking and whileusing a variety of increasingly difﬁcult stances (i.e., heels and toes together, half-tandem, and full tandem stance). Eachtraining session will last approximately 40 minutes.tDCS PROTOCOL: A tDCS device (Soterix) will deliver a small direct current through two sponge surface electrodes (5cm × 7 cm) soaked with ~15 mL of NaCl saline. The middle of the medial edge of the positive electrode (anode) will bepositioned 1 cm below and 2 cm lateral to the inion over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the more MS-affectedside. The negative electrode (cathode) will be placed with the medial edge 1 cm below and 2 cm lateral to the inion overthe cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to the more MS-affected side (bilateral montage). Stimulation will beadministered for [ADDRESS_454256] seated comfortably in a chair. Active stimulation will start with a 30 s ramp-up to the target intensity (4 mA), after which the intensity will be maintained for 20 min before being ramped-down to 0mA over 30 s.SHAM PROTOCOL: During sham, the tDCS device automatically administers a 30 s ramp-up immediately followed bya 30 s ramp-down both at the beginning and the end of the 20 min stimulation period; in the intervening time, theintensity will be maintained at 0 mA.WHOLE BODY IMAGING: Prior to FDG administration, subjects will be asked to fast for a minimum of [ADDRESS_454257] be &#8804; 200 mg/dL to proceed with the imaging.

Subjects will receive paymentwithin two weeks of the completion of their last session (including withdraws).VIII. RisksVIII.1What are the risks to subjects including- emotional or psychological- ﬁnancial- legal or social- physical?tDCS safety: tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique in which a very weak electrical current is applied to thescalp. tDCS has been conducted on humans and animals for many years and noevidence has emerged to suggest that it is harmful or has ever induced a serious side effect. However, the safety of tDCSis dependent on current strength, electrode size, and stimulation duration. Accordingly, these parameters have beeninvestigated to establish safe and effective stimulation parameters for tDCS applications in research involving humansubjects. The only side effects that have been reported when proper guidelines arefollowed are a temporary headache, skin redness under the electrodes, and/or tingling, itching, and burning sensations insome subjects. For example, a [ADDRESS_454259] recently been reported in research and review articles(Nitsche et al. 2008; Hummel et al. 2008). Physiological studies have also assessed the safety of tDCS when appliedwithin the aforementioned stimulation guidelines. For example, there was no neuronal damage as measured by [CONTACT_364467]-speciﬁc enolase (Stagg & Nitsche, 2011 ) or MRI measures of edema using contrast enhanced and diffusion-weighted MRI measures following administration of tDCS (Nitsche et al. 2004). Furthermore, tDCS did not negativelyalter measures of neuropsychological function and EEG activity (Iver et al. 2005). Accordingly, rat studies using tDCSmodels emulating tDCS applied to humans (Liebetanz et al. 2009 ) showed that the current density needed to inducetissue damage or lesions was about 1429 mA/cm^2, whereas the current densities used in human studies are between 0.04and 0.08 mA/cm^2 and in this proposal are 0.06 mA/cm^2 and 0.011 mA/cm^2. In conclusion, the tDCS stimulationparameters in this study are identical to the most common in the literature and have been proven to be exceptionally safeand well-tolerated. The probability is very unlikely that harm may occur (see above). Based on the available literature aslight headache should be the worst possible negative effect and should be very rare. In this case, non-prescriptionmedication should relieve the headache within 1-2 hours.Risks of performing motor tasks: There is potential for injury (muscle strain) resulting from the walking and balance testsand training. There is also a potential for falling during the balance tasks, particularly for PwMS, who have a higher fallrisk in general. Other risks may include feelings of anxiety and/or stress induced by [CONTACT_152644], which can lead to anincrease in heart rate and blood pressure.PET Imaging: This study involves the administration of a PET radiopharmaceutical, [18F]ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG).FDG has been used at the University of Iowa and throughout the world for a variety of conditions. There have been a fewreports of relatively rare side-effects involving temporary low blood pressure and allergic reactions. As a result ofparticipating in this research, each subject will receive a dose of radiation equivalent to approximately 90% of the dosethat a medical radiation worker can accrue yearly. Although there are no proven harmful effects from the level ofradiation exposure in this study, long-term effects on a subject’s health cannot be ruled out with certainty. Pregnancy is acontraindication to PET imaging. Thus, all women of childbearing potential will undergo a pregnancy test before PETimaging. Injection of tracers will require the placement of an intravenous catheter. As in any procedures involvingcatheters placed in veins, there are several risks, including infection, clotting, or continued bleeding. There may also bebruising, skin irritation, and a dull ache at the site of injection. The subject will be asked to fast for a minimum of 6 hours

Page 18 of 20https://hawkirb.research.uiowa.edu/hawkirb/summary/projects.page?mode=pf&OID=70618871prior to the FDG study. There is a small risk of hypoglycemia associated with this fast.Risks of MRI: Participants may be uncomfortable inside the MRI scanner if they do not like to be in closed spaces(“claustrophobia”). During the procedure, they will be able to talk with the MRI staff through a speaker system.Participants can stop the scan at any time.The MRI scanner produces a loud hammering noise, which has produced hearing loss in a very small number of patients.Participants will be given noise-canceling headphones to reduce this risk. A metal object ﬂying through the air toward themagnet and hitting the participants presents the greatest risk associated with MRI. To reduce this risk, we require that allpeople involved with the study remove all metal from their clothing and pockets. No metal objects will be brought intothe magnet room while participants are inside the room. In addition, the door to the room will remain closed throughoutthe study so that no one can accidentally bring a metal object into the room.There are no known risks associated with limited exposure to magnetic ﬁelds.

Data AnalysisXI.1Describe the analysis methods you will use, including, if applicable, the variables you will analyzeAll imaging data will be transferred to the Integrative Neurophysiology Lab in the Department of Health and HumanPhysiology for analysis. The prior and post-treatment FDG images will be co-registered to the anatomical CT images.Anatomically based volumes-of-interest (VOIs) will be generated manually using the View tool of PMOD. In the upperleg, the knee extensors (rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and vastus lateralis) and knee ﬂexors (longand short head of the biceps femoris, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, sartorius, and gracilis) will be identiﬁed. In thelower leg, the plantar ﬂexors (gastrocnemius, soleus, peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, ﬂexor digitorum longus, ﬂexorhallucis longus, and tibialis posterior) and the dorsiﬂexors (tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, and extensorhallucis longus) will be identiﬁed. Standardized uptake values (SUV) based on the injected dose and body weight will becalculated for each muscle. Although the participants will fast for a minimum of [ADDRESS_454262] blood glucose (adjusted to 100mg/dL) and/or by [CONTACT_364472] a reference tissue to allow for comparison across experimental sessions. The data willbe analyzed using PMOD Version 4.001 (PMD Technologies LLC, Zürich, Switzerland). Asymmetry indices (AIs) willbe calculated to determine the magnitude of asymmetry in SUVs between the legs using a previously used equation23,82.An AI greater than 10% will be considered asymmetric. Spearman’s correlation will be used to test whether the change inFDG uptake is signiﬁcantly related to the change in walking and balance scores after ctDCS and training. We will use aliberal signiﬁcance threshold to avoid type II errors because the relatively low number of subjects in this study leads toconservative testing. The level of statistical signiﬁcance for all brain imaging analyses is p < 0.005 without correction.A stimulation (sham vs. 4 mA) by [CONTACT_45437] (balance vs. gait) by [CONTACT_5586] (24 hours, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks) ANCOV A withbaseline measurements as covariates will be conducted on each outcome variable (e.g., distance walked on the 6MWTand FGA score) to compare the short- and long-term effects of gait and balance training combined with ctDCS. Levene’stest and normality tests (QQ plots, Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_171447], and histograms) will be used to test the statistical assumptions. Post-hoc testing (paired and unpaired t-tests) and effect sizes (Cohen’s d) will be calculated to clarify signiﬁcant main orinteraction effects. Signiﬁcance will be accepted at p &#8804; 0.05 and adjusted with a Bonferroni correction.

Page 20 of 20https://hawkirb.research.uiowa.edu/hawkirb/summary/projects.page?mode=pf&OID=70618871We used effect sizes (Cohen’s d = 2.08 and 1.37, respectively) from Pi[INVESTIGATOR_364447]. 202060 and Hebert et al. 201146 tocalculate the required sample size. With a signiﬁcance ﬁxed at p = 0.05 and 80% power, we will require 40 total subjects(n = 10 in each group) to properly power the hypothesis test for a statistically signiﬁcant change. Based on thiscalculation and the assumption of a standard drop out rate of approximately 20%, we propose to recruit 48 total subjects(n = 12 in each group).XII.

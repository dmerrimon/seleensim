CONFIDENTIAL  8 1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Crohn's Disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease  (IBD)  that is serious, debilitating, and 
potentially life -threatening. The disease is  termed a  “disease of the young” because it usually 
strikes children, teens, and young adults. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_177300] 15 to 2 5 years . Its 
inflammation can cause severe pain, diarrhea, and other intestinal problems. CD affects men and 
women equally and appears to show a familial predisposition. Approximately 20 -30% of people 
with CD have a direct blood relative with some form of IBD. World -wide, an estimated 1.4 
million people suffer from CD (700,000 US) and the number of sufferers is growing at a rate of at 
least 1% each year. The disease is now considered to be the second most common chronic 
inflammatory disorder after rheumatoi d arthritis.  
One of the potential causes of CD is thought to be gastrointestinal infection with Mycobacterium 
avium subspecies paratuberculosis  (MAP) and mycobacterial molecules have been shown to 
dysregulate immune signaling pathways as part of the organi sm’s evolved survival strategy. MAP 
has been difficult to isolate from CD patients and it is postulated that it asserts its pathological 
effect either as an infectious agent or by [CONTACT_177308].  
One of the hindrances to testing for MAP  infection in CD patients is that MAP is a very slow  
growing mycobacterium. MAP shed their cell walls when they infect humans, a tactic that 
enables them to escape identification and attack by [CONTACT_177309].  
Studies conducted to demonstrate  the presence of MAP noted it in 55.4% (range 16 -92%) of CD 
subjects vs. 8.2% (range of 0 -49%) of control groups across multiple diagnostic specimens e.g. 
blood, tissue and culture. Recent work in Israel, Japan, and Ireland has shown that human tissue 
and white cells can be infected with MAP and this infection results in cytokine production, 
especially TNF -α and therefore indicate s that MAP plays a role in CD.  
Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_177301]. In addition, the cost of a 
number of these available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_177302], thereby [CONTACT_177310]. As a result, there continues to be a significant unmet need for more effective disease 
management of CD.  
Several studies evaluating antimicrobial treatment directe d at MAP to treat patients with CD have 
been reported. Given their slow growth and periods of latency, treatment of mycobacterial 
diseases require s multiple antibiotics including triple therapy to avoid the development of 
resistance.  
RHB -[ADDRESS_207823] mycobacteria, i.e.,  
clarithromycin, rifabutin, and clofazimine. The rationale for the development of RHB -104 is to 
demonstrate the efficacy of an antimicrobial therapy consisting of clarithromycin: 95mg,  
rifabutin: 45mg, and clofazimine: 10mg in the treatment of CD patients. These active ingredients 
and doses were selected to maximize therapeutic effectiveness against MAP. The dosing rationale 
of each active ingredient is supported by [CONTACT_716]:  
•  prescriber information for each active ingredient  
•  the study by [CONTACT_177311]. utilizing a sub -optimal treatment regimen  
•  a long -term, retrospective Australian study where [ADDRESS_207824] completed  26 weeks of blinded study drug administration in the RHB -104- 
01 study (MAP US) and remain out of remission with CDA I ≥150 will be eligible for 
participation  in this study designed to offer open label therapy with active RHB -104. 
 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
2.1 Study Objectives  
 
2.1.1 Primary  Objective  
 
The primary objective is to estimate the remission rate, defined as a CD AI score of less than 150, 
at 16 weeks after the initiation of the open -label phase.  
 
2.1.2  Secondary Objective  
 
 The secondary objective is to estimate the response rate of patients, defined by a reduction of 
CDAI score of ≥[ADDRESS_207825] response among participants .  
3.  To estimate the average duration of response am ong participants .  
4.  To estimate the proportion of participants who maintain a state of remission from week 16 
through week 52 .  
 
2.1.4 Selected Other Objectives  
 
MAP Detection:  
 
1.    To estimate the proportion of subjects with a MAP positive blood PCR assay at  baseline 
(week 0 of the open label phase) .  
2.  To estimate the proportion of subjects with a change in MAP blood PCR assay status  after 16 
weeks of treatment compared to baseline (week 0 of the open label phase) . 
3.  To estimate the proportion of subjects with a c hange in MAP blood PCR assay status  after 52 
weeks of treatment compared to baseline (week 0 of the open label phase) . 
4.    To make sequential comparisons of MAP blood PCR assay results per subject . 
5.    To estimate the proportion of enrolled subjects with a M AP positive blood culture at  baseline 
(week 0 of the open label phase) . 
6.    To estimate the proportion of subjects with a change in MAP blood culture status after  26 
weeks of treatment compared to baseline (week 0 of the open label phase) . 
7.    To estimate th e proportion of subjects with a change in MAP blood culture status after  52 
weeks of treatment compared to baseline (week 0 of the open label phase) . 
 
Because the buffy coat is the actual component of blood that is cultured, MAP blood culture 
should be con sidered  equivalent to MAP buffy coat culture. Because the development of  a MAP

2.2 Outcomes/ Endpoints  
 
The outcome en dpoints for summaries  by [CONTACT_177312] ( RHB-104 treatment 
and Placebo ) and overall are grouped into 4 families  based on level of objectives : (i) primary 
endpoint; (ii) key secondary endpoint ; (iii) selected other s econdary endpoints; and (iv) selected 
other endpoints.   
 
2.2.1 Primary Endpoint/ Variable : Remission  
 
In gene ral use of rescue medication is considered as treatment failure (not achieving remission or 
response) if there are any new use of rescue medication to treat CD or increased rescue 
medication dose from baseline prior to any remission or response assessment.   Please refer to 
section 6.1. [ADDRESS_207827] having a Crohn’s 
Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of < 150.  Subjects who have a Week 1 6 CDAI 
measurement ≥ [ADDRESS_207828] dosing 
time of open -label phase and from here and after it would be reference as initiation.

Version 1.0, 23 Dec 2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  11 The CDAI is used to assess the activity of CD; higher scores indicate more active disease.  
 
2.2.2 Key Secondary Endpoint/Variable  
 
The k ey secondary variable  is the p roportion of  subjects  who experienced response a t week 1 6 
after initiation , where response is de fined as reduction from baseline of ≥[ADDRESS_207829] a change from baseline to week 1 6 in CDAI score which is not a reduction of 
≥ [ADDRESS_207830] a change from baseline to week  16 in CDAI score will be classified as 
not having  experienced response  at that time point . 
 
2.2.3 Selected Other Secondary Endpoints/Variables  
 
• Time to remission – Number of weeks after initiation  that a subject first records a state of 
remission ( CDAI score < 150 ). It will be calculated as the date on which r emission is first 
observed minus the date of the first dosing date plus [ADDRESS_207831] assessment of CDAI sc ore.   
• Duration of remission – The number of weeks the subject is in remission (CDAI score < 
150). It will be calculated as the first date following remission at which CDAI is ≥[ADDRESS_207832] CDAI assessment.  Duration of remission will be 
calculated only for patients achieving remission.  
• Time to response – Number of weeks after initiation that a subject first achieves a state of 
response (a reduction from baseline of ≥100 in CDAI score). It will be calculated as the 
date on which response is first observed minus the date of the first dose , plus [ADDRESS_207833] assessment of CDAI score.   
• Duration of response – Time in weeks that a subject is in a state of response  (a reduction 
from baseline of ≥ 100 in CDAI score). It will be calculated as the first date following 
response at w hich the reduction from baseline in CDAI is <[ADDRESS_207834] CDAI assessment. Duration of  response will be calculated only for 
patients achieved response.  
• Proportion of subjects experienced maintenance of remission (CDAI score < 150) from 
week 16 through week 52.  Subjects experiencing a CDAI score ≥ [ADDRESS_207835] no CDAI measurement week 16 
or week 52 will be considered as having not achieved maintenance of remission .

CONFIDENTIAL  18 CDAI Missing Data:  
 
The computation of CDAI requires [ADDRESS_207843] 
will be categorized as a non -responder and the CDAI score will be considered missing. As 
specified in section 2.2 , subjects with missing assessment will be assumed to not be in a state of 
remission /success for each scheduled visit (week 16, 26, or 52) .   
 
Handling of missing date information for AEs:  
The term missing date  refers to  a completely missing date or to partial date where  month or/and 
day or/and year is/are missing , e.g. missing month/day/year. Missing start and end dates will be 
imputed conservatively, i.e. missing values will be imputed in such a way that the duration of  the 
AE is considered with the longest possible duration . The missing start date and end date of AE 
will be imputed for the purpose of defining treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) and for 
assigning events to treatment periods using the following defin itions :  
 
(i)  Adverse Event Start Date:  
Event Missing Day: If Adverse event day is missing but month and year present , then impute the 
1st of the month unless month and year are the same as first dose of study drug then impute day 
first day of dose . 
Event Mi ssing day and month – If adverse event day and month both are missing but year is 
present then impute 1st January unless year is the same as first dose date then impute day and 
month first dose day and month.  
Completely missing – impute first dose date unl ess the end date suggests it could have started 
prior to this in which case impute the 1st January of the same year as the end date.   
 
(ii)  Adverse Event End Date:  
Missing day – If AE day is missing but month and year is present then impute the last day of the  
month.  
Missing day and month – If AE has missing day and month but year is present then impute 31st 
December.  
Completely Missing – Required to  look at whether the AE is still ongoing before imputing a date 
and also when it started in relation to study dru g. If the ongoing flag is missing then assume that 
AE is still present (i.e. do not impute a date). If the AE has stopped and start date is prior to first

Each verbatim adverse event (AE) term recorded during the study will be mapped to a system 
organ class and preferred term using the current MedDRA Dictionary.  
 
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an AE that based on start date information 
occurred aft er the first study drug administration or an AE that started before the first study drug 
administration but worsened in severity (i.e., became more severe) after administration of the 
study drug.  
 
Treatment related adverse events will be defined as the ad verse events for  which the investigator 
indicates the relationship to study drug a s possible, probable, or definite . If the relationship to 
study drug for an AE is not recorded, it will be assumed to be treatment related in the summary 
tables. Similarly, i f severity of an AE is missing, the severity will be summarized as severe .

value will be used  for summarization . All values will be presented in the data listings.  
 
Listings of all  individual laboratory data, indicating any values out of the normal range will be 
produced.  A listing of lab parameter values flagged as abnormal will also be provided.    
 
6.4.3  Vital Signs     
 
Vital signs includ e the following:  
• Supi[INVESTIGATOR_119225] b lood pressure  (SBP)   
• Supi[INVESTIGATOR_177304] b lood pressure  (DBP)   
• Supi[INVESTIGATOR_177305]   
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]   
• Temperature  
• Height  
• Weight  
• BMI  
 
Vital signs are recorded at baseline and at different visits post -baseline. Actual and change from 
baseline values will be summariz ed using d escriptive statistics  by [CONTACT_3232] . The 
mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be used to summarize the data. For each 
subject, vi tal signs data will be presented in a data listing.  
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_207853] data listing s with annotations 
indicating  any abnormal  values .  For analysis details and presentation of the ECG findings , a 
specialized independent technical report will be produced by  [CONTACT_177339].   
 
6.4.5 Uveitis Assessment   
 
Results from Uveitis assessments will be listed and summa rized as the number and percentage of 
subjects with Uveitis suspected (yes or no), and if suspected, with Uveitis confirmed (yes or no).

CONFIDENTIAL  31 Because the buffy coat is the actual component of bl ood that is cultured, MAP blood culture 
should be considered equivalent to MAP buffy coat culture. Because the development of a MAP 
blood PCR assay is still in progress, MAP detection objectives 1 -4 will comprise the contents of a 
later report and will not  be addressed in tables, listings, or figures of this clinical study report.  
 
Change from baseline in the Short Form -36 Health Survey (SF -36) total score  have been  removed 
to be consistent with parent study.   Summary of domains are removed in SAP.  
 
Correl ation s between the change from baseline in SES-CD and the change from baseline in CDAI  
to week 16 and 52 are not included in SAP.  
 
 
7. ADDITIONAL OTHER EXPLOATORY ANALYSES  
 
Other exploratory subgroup analyses to characterize safety and efficacy activities of HRB -104 
may be conducted. These additional exploratory analyses will be decided at the time of final data 
analysis  if deemed necessary .

Subject Migration  
There are two types of migratio n, Partial and Full.  Subjects who complete the 
optional screening visit receive a Partial data migration.  Subjects who did not 
complete the optional screening visit receive a full migration.  Data migrated from 
RHB -104-01 to RHB -104-04 will be frozen upo n migration.  Fields that will not be 
frozen are fields that will need to be completed during the course of the study.  
Partial Migration  (subject completes  optional screening visit)  
The only visit folders that will receive migrated data are Screening and L og Pages.

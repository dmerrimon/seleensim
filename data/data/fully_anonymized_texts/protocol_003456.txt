Objective:  Primary: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 concentrations of Atro pi[INVESTIGATOR_413242] (0.01% and 0.02%) compared to Vehicle (placebo) for sl owing the progression of myopia 
in children over a 3-year treatment period. 
Exploratory:  To observe safety and efficacy in subjects re-randomized to 1 year of treatment with 
Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413202], 0.01% or 0.02%, or Vehicl e following 3 years of treatment 
in children with progressive myopia. 
Study Rationale:  
Vyluma Inc., an affiliate of Nevakar Inc., hereinafter referred  to as the Sponsor, is pursuing the 
development of Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_545804].  
Ametropia in children is common, and if left uncorrected causes  decreased vision, visual discomfort 
(eye strain), strabismus, and/ or amblyopia (AAPOS 2013). The mo st common form of refractive 
error is myopia (nearsightedness), which has its onset in child ren 6 to 12 years of age 
(Zadnik 2015). 
Study Population:  
Study subjects will be childre QPDOHRUIHPDOHDJHGWR\HDUVDWWKHWLPHRIHQUROO PHQW
with myopia spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of at least - 0.50 D and no greater than -6.00 D in 
each eye, astigmatism of no more than -1.50 D in each eye, and anisometropia (SER) of < 1.50 D as 
measured by [CONTACT_545823]. 
Methodology:  
This will be a 3-arm randomized, multicenter, double-masked, pl acebo-controlled study conducted 
in 2 stages. Stage 1 is a safety and efficacy phase of 3 years (36 months) in duration, during which 
subjects will be allocated to 1 of 3 study medications. Stage 2  is a randomized cross-over phase of 
1 year (12 months) in duration, during which subjects will be r e-randomized to receive 1 of the 3 
study medications with subjects initially randomized to Vehicle  only eligible for randomization to

at least -0.50 D and no greater than -6.00 D in each eye as mea sured by [CONTACT_545823]. 
At screening/baseline (Day 0), the site will obtain signed info rmed consent from the parent or legal 
guardian of the subject and assent from the subject (as applica ble). The subject will then undergo a 
screening evaluation to determine eligibility for the study as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
defined in the protocol. Following confirmation of eligibility,  the clinical site will access the 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT), which will assign the su bject to 1 of the 3 treatment arms 
and assign the initial study medication kit to be dispensed to the parent/guardian following 
instruction on administration. The allocated study medication w ill be administered, one drop in each 
eye once daily (QD), at bedtime, for 3 years. 
Treatment arms are: 
x Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413202], 0.01% 
x Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_413202], 0.02% 
x Vehicle (placebo) 
Both eyes will be treated; myopia must be bilateral to qualify.  If myopia is unilateral at screening or 
the child seems likely to cross the threshold for bilateral myo pia of at least -0.[ADDRESS_714360] 
can be asked to return while the enrollment period is still ope n to determine his or her eligibility. 
Subjects will return to the clinical site at 6-month intervals for 3 years to undergo a series of safety 
and efficacy evaluations and at  3-month intervals throughout th e study for update of concomitant 
medications and adverse event (AE) assessment. While it is pref erred that the subject attend every 
visit, the parent/guardian may attend a 3-month visit without t he subject if necessary; both the 
subject and their parent/guardian must be present for all 6-mon th visits. At each study visit, 
unopened/unused and used study medication materials will be ret urned, concomitant medications 
will be updated, AE assessment will be conducted, allocated stu dy medication will be dispensed for 
the next 3-month study period, and treatment adherence assessme nt will be performed. 
Site staff will also contact [CONTACT_545824]/guardian s by [CONTACT_545825] [ADDRESS_714361] completes all safety and efficacy assessments a t Month 36 (the primary efficacy time

completed between 6:00 PM and 11:[ADDRESS_714366] or their  parent/guardian do not complete 
the e-diary within the allotted time, they will not be able to enter the missing data retroactively, as 
the purpose is to collect information on the actual date the st udy drops were instilled. Once data is 
submitted, this information will be automatically entered into the study’s Medidata Rave database. 
Inclusion of the Modified Amblyop ia Treatment Index (ATI), qual ity of life (QoL) 
questionnaire 
At Month 42 and Month 48, in addition to other assessments, the  study staff will encourage 
participation in the Modified Amblyopia Treatment Index (ATI), quality of life (QoL) questionnaire 
which has been added to the study to be completed by [CONTACT_70579] t and their parent/guardian. 
Participation is voluntary and will be documented. The parent/g uardian questionnaire should be 
completed prior to the subject’s questionnaire. The questionnai res should be completed prior to the 
Investigator’s examination of the subject. 
All subjects are to be re-consented/re-assented at their next s tudy visit, including subjects 
completing an End of Study (EOS) Visit (Stage 1 – Month 36, Mon th 39, Month 42, Month 45, and

Study Procedures : 
Office Visits should occur within ± 2 weeks of the expected vis it date.  
Screening/Randomization/Baseline Visit (Day 0):  Sites should complete 
screening/randomization/baseline procedures and enroll subjects  within [ADDRESS_714373] (as applicable). The subject will t hen undergo screening evaluations to 
determine eligibility for the study which will include review o f medical/ocular and prior medication 
history, a urine pregnancy test for female subjects of childbea ring potential, heart rate (HR), 
monocular Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) measurement at di stance and near, photopic pupil 
size measurement, slit-lamp examination (SLE) (check for narrow  angles), tonometry, dilated 
fundus examination and cycloplegic autorefraction. Height and w eight will also be assessed.  
Following confirmation of eligibility, the clinical site will m easure axial length and, if possible, 
crystalline lens thickness. The site will access the IRT, which  will assign the subject to 1 of the 
3 treatment arms and assign the initial study medication kit to  be dispensed to the parent/guardian 
following instruction on administration. 
One (1) drop of the study medication will be administered into each eye QD, at bedtime. Because 
AEs are to be collected beginning after signing of informed con sent/assent, the site will document 
any events that may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_456022]/guardian that occur 
before the end of the visit.  
If the subject requires initial or new spectacles/contact [CONTACT_126107] s (applicable if the refraction reveals at 
least -0.50 D myopic progression and/or if the eye care practit ioner deems it clinically necessary to 
improve vision), the site will provide a refractive prescriptio n and lenses/frames (if needed) or soft 
contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
All screening evaluations will serve as baseline measurements.

Once the modified ATI is completed, subjects will undergo a mea surement of height, weight, HR, 
BCVA measurement (distance and near), photopic pupil size measu rement, SLE, tonometry, dilated 
fundus examination, cycloplegic autorefraction, axial length, a nd, if possible, crystalline lens 
thickness. Sites will update concomitant medications, conduct A E assessment, review e-diary, and 
perform treatment adherence assessment. The site staff will uni nstall the Medidata eCOA 
application (installed on the cell phone) or retrieve the devic e provisioned by [CONTACT_545835].

(EOS) procedures should be performed at the visit the subject i s discontinued. 
If a subject is off study medica tion and is being followed for safety assessments then an EOS Month 
36 visit should be completed, as these subjects will not contin ue on to Stage 2.  
 
Unscheduled visits 
Unscheduled visits may occur at the Investigator’s discretion t o address any possible issues the 
subject may experience that are of concern to the subject or pa rent/guardian (e.g., blurry vision, 
pain, redness in one or both eyes). 
 
Efficacy Assessments: 
x SER error in each eye measured by [CONTACT_545823]  
x Axial length  
x Crystalline lens thickness (exploratory efficacy measurement)  
Treatment Adherence: 
Treatment adherence will be measured by [CONTACT_545836]. Throughout treatment 
(efficacy/safety portion and randomized cross-over portion), th e amount of unopened medication 
units will be recorded at each study visit. 
 
Documentation of Mode of Administration : 
At the EOS Month [ADDRESS_714380] or their parent/guardian: 
x Who administered the eyedrops to the subject during the study ( i.e., self-administered or 
administered by [CONTACT_7078]/guardian)?  
x Was there a transition in the dosing administrator? 
x If yes, at what approximate age did the transition occur? 
Safety Assessments: 
x Heart Rate 
x Monocular BCVA in each eye at 
distance and near 
x Photopic pupil size 
x Slit Lamp Exam  
x Dilated fundus examination 
x Adverse Events  
x Tonometry 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: 
To minimize risk and ensure the immediate safety of study subje cts, both local and systemic 
anticholinergic and other potential effects of study medication  will be measured at each visit. 
Parameters such as heart rate, mydriasis, photophobia, blurred near vision, ocular and conjunctival 
inflammation and allergic reactions to study medication will be  carefully and routinely monitored to 
assess both safety and tolerability.

review will be performed concurre ntly with Data Management’s re view of data and issue of queries 
to sites. The aim of the medical review is to monitor eligibili ty issues, assess potential protocol 
deviations and identify safety issues.  
In addition, the peer-reviewed and grey literature as well as g lobal databases of AEs from other 
atropi[INVESTIGATOR_545817]. 
Withdrawal of Subjects: 
All subjects randomized into the study will be encouraged to co mplete all study assessments 
through the Month 48 Visit (End o f Study), including subjects t hat cannot or do not wish to 
continue study treatment (withdraw consent/assent from study tr eatment but are willing to continue 
study visits). 
The following are the criteria for considering withdrawal from the study (Study discontinuation 
prior to Visit Month 48): 
x Withdrawal of subject consent/as sent to continue with study vis its. 
x If the site and/or the overall study is terminated for any reas on. 
x The Investigator considers it is in the best interest for the s ubject to leave the study. 
This may include the development of damage to the cornea (Secti on 8.5 – 
Discontinuation of Study Medication). 
If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason for the subje ct’s withdrawal will be recorded in 
the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
If a subject is discontinued from study medication before the M onth [ADDRESS_714381] 
should continue in the study off study medication. Subjects sho uld be encouraged to return for the 6 
Month interval visits; however, returning for the 12 Month inte rval visits is essential. Subjects 
discontinuing study medication prior to Month 36 would continue  to be seen for scheduled visits 
(at 6 Month or 12 Month intervals  as noted above) until they re ach the Month 36 interval.

 Statistical Methods: 
Analysis Sets: 
Enrolled Set: All subjects enrolled. 
Safety Set: All subjects who were administered at least one dos e of study medication for a given 
stage. 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) Set: All randomized subjects for a given stage. 
Modified intent-to-treat (mITT) Set: All randomized subjects, f or a given stage, aged 6 to 10 years 
at the time of randomization in Stage 1. This will be the popul ation for the primary efficacy 
analyses. 
Per Protocol Set (PPS): All s ubjects who remain in the study th rough end of stage and have no 
major or critical protocol violations (as defined in the SAP). 
Modified Per Protocol Set (mPPS): All subjects in the PPS in ea ch stage who were aged 6 to 10 
years at the time of randomization in Stage 1. 
 
Statistical Analyses: The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be performed u sing the mITT Set assuming data 
missing at random. 
The primary analysis and any other analysis of binary response measures will be performed using a 
mixed-effects model based on the binomial distribution using  a  logit link function.  The model will 
include subject, treatment group, visit, eye (left or right), a nd baseline age group (as randomized) 
and SER (as randomized) as independent variables and treatment group-by-visit interaction term 
included.  Random intercepts for subject and eye within subject  will be included using variance 
components and compound symmetry covariance structures, respect ively.   In addition, sensitivity 
analyses will be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint to  assess the impact of missing data.  
These sensitivity analyses will be described in the statistical  analysis plan. 
For comparisons of mean change from baseline for continuous mea sures, the analysis will be 
performed using a mixed-effects model with a random intercept.  The model will include treatment 
group, visit, eye (left or right), baseline age group (as rando mized), and baseline SER group (as 
randomized) as independent variables and the treatment group-by -visit interaction. Will be 
included.  The degrees of freedom will be determined using the Kenward-Roger approximation.

Title of study: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double- blind ed, Propofol-controlled, Phase 3 Clinical Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of HSK3486 Injectable Emulsion for Induction of General Anesthesia in Adults 
Undergoing Elective Surgery 
Indication:  Induction of general anesthesia in adult subjects undergoing elective surgery with endotracheal 
intubation  
Number of study centers: Up to approximately 20 sites in the US will be included in this study.  
Development phase:  Phase 3  
Objectives:  
Primary objective: 
• To demonstrate HSK3486 0.4/0.2 mg/kg (0.4 mg/kg intravenous [IV] slow injection for the first dose, an 
additional 0.2 mg/kg if needed) is non- inferior to propofol 2.0/1.0 mg/kg  (2.0 mg/kg IV slow injection for first 
dose, an additional 1.0 mg/kg if needed) in success of induction of general anesthesia in adults undergoing 
elective surgery.  
Secondar y objectives:  
Key secondary objectives: 
• To confirm that HSK3486 0.4/0.2 mg/kg leads to statistically significant less injection -site pain in all 
compared to propofol 2.0/1.0 mg/kg during the induction of general anesthesia in adults undergoing elective surgery. 
• To demonstrate HSK3486 0.4/0.2 mg/kg provides better anesthetic effects compared to propofol 2.0/1.0 mg/kg without significant cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_748543].  
Additional Efficacy Objective: 
• To evaluate HSK3486 0.4/0.2 mg/kg induction time in general anesthesia compared to propofol. 
• To evaluate HSK3486 0.4/0.2 mg/kg time to the disappearance of eyelash reflex compared to propofol. 
• To confirm that HSK3486 0.4/0.2 mg/kg leads to statistically  significant less moderate injection -site pain 
compared to propofol 2.0/1.0 mg/kg during the induction of general anesthesia in adults undergoing elective 
surgery. 
• To better characterize that HSK3486 0.4/0.2 mg/kg leads to statistically  significant less average NRS scales in 
injection -site pain compared to propofol 2.0/1.0 mg/kg during the induction of general anesthesia in adults 
undergoing elective surgery.  
Safety:  
• To evaluate the overall safety profile of HSK3486 compared to propofol.

Page 6 of 110 Methodology/study design: 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blinded, propofol-controlled, phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of HSK3486 for induction of general anesthesia in adults undergoing elective surgery with 
endotracheal intubation.  
After scr eening, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either HSK3486 0.4/0.2 mg/kg (i.e., 
0.4 mg/kg IV slow injection over 30 [±5] seconds followed by [CONTACT_33018] 0.2 mg/kg dose over 10 [±2] seconds 
if needed) or propofol 2.0/1.0 mg/kg ( i.e., 2.0 mg/kg IV slow injection over 30 [±5] seconds followed by [CONTACT_102160] 1.0 mg/kg dose over 10 [±2]  seconds if needed) in a blinded manner. Enrolled subjects will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_748590] (ASA -PS; I -II and III- IV), age (<65 and ≥65 years), and 
Body Mass Index (BMI <35 and ≥35 kg/m2). Endotracheal intubation will be performed after adequate anesthetic 
induction (Modified Observer’s Assessment of Awareness/Sedation [MOAA/S] ≤1) ( Appendix 1) has been 
achieved and administration of neuromuscular blocking agent.  
On Day 1 , premedication is allowed prior to induction except for sedative-hypnotics, analgesics ( eg., opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
NSAIDs, APAP) , or any medications that relieve pain (eg., Gabapentin) , unless otherwise specified in the 
protocol. Premedication should be recorded if used. Prior to administration of the study drug in the operating room, the preoperative readiness of each subject will be 
confirmed. Oxygen will be supplied through a facemask (oxygen flow rate: ≥ 4 L/min) 
at least [ADDRESS_1023598] and maintenance IV solution (normal saline [NS], lactated ringer’s [LR], or 5% dextrose) 
will be administrated through IV infusion. Throughout the preinduction and induction periods, a timing device must be used to allow accuracy and sequencing of necessary assessments.

Preinduction period:  
• Obtain vital signs (heart rate [HR], respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] [RR], oxygen saturation [SpO 2], systolic blood pressure 
[SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], mean arterial pressure [MAP]), Temperature [Temp] ; baseline 
value will be the measurement immediately prior to initiation of study drug administration . Attach 3 -lead 
or 5-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to subject and monitor continuously. In the event an abnormality is 
noted with 3- lead or 5 -lead ECG, clinical significance of an abnormality should be documented, and the 
investigators will decide whether to add a 12-lead ECG.  
• Attach bispectral index (BIS [ Appendix 2 ]) monitor to subject.  Record the three most recent BIS values 
precedi ng midazolam administration.  
• Subjects will receive IV midazol am at dose 0.04 mg/kg, up to 3 mg maximum over 15 [±2] seconds at 5 
minutes [±30 seconds ] prior to initiation of induction agents as premedication. The midazolam dose can be 
reduced according to patient’s age and comorbidities as per the anesthetist’s discretion.  The start  and end 
time of midazolam administration should be recorded.  The end time of midazolam administration will 
begin the window  to start of IP .  
• Subjects will receive preinduction IV fentanyl at a dose of 1 mcg/kg rounded up to the nearest 25 mcg, up 
to 100 mcg maximum over 15 [±2] seconds at 2 minutes [±10 seconds] prior to initiation of induction 
agents. The fentanyl dose can be reduced according to patient’s age and comorbidities as per the anesthetist’s discretion.
 The start  and end time of fentanyl administration should be recorded.  The end time 
of fentanyl administration will begin the window  to start of IP . 
Note: Throughout the preinduction and induction periods, a timing device must be used to allow accuracy and sequencing of necessary assessments.  
• Information about any adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications will be recorded.  
Induction period of general anesthesia:  
The induction of general anesthesia will be performed as follows:

Page 8 of 110 • Monitor vital signs (HR, RR, SpO 2, SBP, DBP, MAP, Temp ) continuously. HR, RR, SBP, DBP, MAP, 
Temp  should be recorded once every 2 minutes [±30 seconds], SpO 2 value should be recorded once every 1 
minute  [± 15 seconds] from the start of study drug administration (for every time point) for [ADDRESS_1023599] 
start of study drug administration, for the judgment of key secondary endpoint.   
Note:  Vital signs (HR, RR, SBP, DBP, MAP , Temp ) monitor should be set to cycle every [ADDRESS_1023600] every 2 minutes (in case cycle requires longer than 1 minute).   
• Administer IV study drug (HSK3486 0.4 mg/kg or propofol 2.0 mg/kg) into vein located on the back of 
right or left hand (this IV location is strongly preferred rather than mandatory) at a port closest to the IV 
cannula (IV injection time: 30 [±5]  seconds) .  
• The MOAA/S will be evaluated every 30 [±10] seconds after end of study drug administration until 
MOAA/S ≤ 1 is reached .  
• If MOAA/S is still >1 at 1 minute [±10 seconds ] post end of study drug administration , a top-up dose 
of 50% of the initial dose of study drug (either HSK3486 0.2 mg/kg or propofol 1 mg/kg depending 
on treatment group) will be given to the subject (IV injection time: 10 [±2]  seconds). Start  and end 
times of top -up dose administration will be recorded. The MOAA/S will be evaluated every 30 [ ±10] 
seconds  post end of the top-up dose administration. 
• If MOAA/S is still >1 at 2 minutes [±10 seconds ] post end of the top- up dose administration, then t he 
rescue drug, propofol, will be given (in both treatment groups). The rescue dose is prepared as t he 
initial calculated propofol dose (100%) and administered per propofol guidelines. The MOAA/S will 
be evaluated every 30 [±10] seconds post end of rescue drug administration until MOAA/S ≤1 is reached.  
• Administration of study drug must be initiated 5 minutes  [±30 seconds ] post midazolam preinduction 
medication  administration stop time and at 2 minutes [±10 seconds] after preinduction fentanyl  
administration stop time . Top-up dose should be administered within 10 seconds once MOAA/S is 
evaluated >1.  
• Injection- site pain  is evaluated verbally by [CONTACT_192812] (NRS;  Appendix  3). Upon initiation of 
study drug administration, the investigator should immediately ask the subject to rate his or her pain at injection -site. As a general guidance, the evaluation should be done multiple times with the first evaluation 
occurring typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 15 seconds after initiation of study drug injection and monitored until successful 
induction (MOAA/S ≤1). Related information, such as the occurrence and severity of injection pain (NRS 0-
10), shall be recorded.
 The maximum (highest value) injection-site pain will be recorded in EDC as NRS.  
• Post the end of initial study drug administration, the eyelash reflex will be evaluated every 30 [±10] 
seconds until loss of eyelash reflex. If there is a top -up dose, eyelash reflex will be evaluated every 30 
[±10] seconds post end of the top-up dose administration until loss of eyelash reflex. If there is rescue drug given, eyelash reflex will be evaluated every 30 [±10] seconds post end of the rescue drug until loss of 
eyelash reflex. The time of loss of eyelash reflex should be recorded.  
• BIS will be monitored continuously; record baseline BIS value prior to administering study drug. BIS 
values will be collected at the following timepoints from  start  of initial study drug administration: every 30

minutes for the duration of the surgery.  
• Monitor 3- lead or 5- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) continuously. Ab normalities  that are clinically 
significant or not clinically significant should be recorded.  The investigators will decide whether to add a 
12-lead ECG.   
• When MOAA/S ≤1 is reached, then IV rocuronium bromide (0.6 mg/kg) is to be administered for 
neuromuscular blockade to perform endotracheal intubation. The start and end times of rocuronium 
bromide administration should be recorded. RR should be collected until initiation of administration of rocuronium. 
   Note:  For subjects with BMI >40 kg/m
2, the rocuronium dose may be modified per investigator discretion.  
Note: Additional IV rocuronium is allowed per investigator’s discretion only in response to clinical symptoms during tracheal intubation, such as gag reflex and movement et al, or during surgical procedures. The start and end times of additional rocuronium bromide administration should be recorded.   
• Intubate subject once neuromuscular blockade has taken  effect; if using twitch monitor, intubate once no 
twitches are noted. The start and end times of first and subsequent intubation attempts should be recorded. 
• During endotracheal intubation, evaluate and record clinical symptoms and/or signs for inadequate depth of 
anesthesia, such as lacrimation, movement, vomiting , coughing, laryngospasm, bucking, swallowing reflex 
and/or bronchospasm, etc. for at least 15 minutes from  start of study drug administration.  
• Between th e start  of study drug administration and prior to the administration of rocuronium bromide , 
evaluate and record respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341].    
Note:  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_748544], defined as absen ce of thoracic movement lasting >30 seconds, 
prior to the administration of rocuronium bromide, or hypoxia, defined as SpO 2 <90% lasting >30 seconds, or 
life-threatening apnea or hypoxia requiring immediate intervention.  
• Evaluate and record cardiac depression from start of study drug administration until the subject leaves the 
operating room. 
Note : Cardiac depression is defined as SBP <90 mmHg lasting >2 minutes plus requiring medical intervention 
such as inotropes, vasopressors, or IV fluid resuscit ation, or life -threatening hypotension requiring immediate 
intervention. 
• Sevoflurane (an inhalation anesthetic agent) will be used for maintenance of general anesthesia. Initiate 
sevoflurane within 60 seconds after successful endotracheal intubation. The end- tidal concentration of 
sevoflurane should be 1.5- 2.0% (The initial concentration that is set and start time of administration should 
be recorded).  
• Information about any adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications will be recorded.   
Maintenance period of general anesthesia:  
• During the maintenance period of general anesthesia, the inhalational anesthetic agent sevoflurane will be used according to routine clinical practice, and the end- tidal concentration of sevoflurane should be 1.5 -
2.0% within [ADDRESS_1023601] after that. Propofol should not be used at any time all throughout the maintenance period.  
• During the maintenance period, end- tidal sevoflurane concentration will be monitored per standard of care.

following timepoints from  start of initial study  drug administration: every 30 [±10]  seconds until 5 minute s, 
then every 2 minutes [±30 seconds ] from 5 minute s until 30 minute s and then every 30 [± 2] minutes for the 
duration of the surgery .  
• Information about any adverse events (AEs) and concomitant med ications will be recorded.  
• Additional IV fentanyl or other analgesic drug may be administered for intraoperative analgesia only after 
initiation of sevoflurane, preferably after 15 minutes following the initiation of study drug administration,  
start time and end time of initial study drug administration should be recorded; if additional drug used, t he 
start and end time of administration should be recorded.  
• Patient management during surgery needs to follow routine best practice which includes Antiemetics Ondansetron, or other 5 HT-3 antagonists and/or Dexamethasone . Antiemetics  should be given during 
surgery and before subjects wake up unless otherwise contraindicated. The use of antiemetics should be recorded  in concomitant medications.  
Follow -up period ([ADDRESS_1023602] Study Drug; [ADDRESS_1023603] Study Drug Administration (Day 2); Day [ADDRESS_1023604]):  
For the first [ADDRESS_1023605] study drug evaluation, study assessments and procedures will be assessed as indicated in 
the Schedule of Assessments:  
• After the s urgery, vital signs (HR, RR, SpO
2, SBP, DBP, MAP,  Temp ) will be assessed at 6 [ ±2] hours post 
start study drug administration.  
Note:  If surgery lasts >4 hours, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests and 12-ECG should be obtained 1[+1 ] hour 
after completion of surgery.  Duration of surgery is defined as time from study drug administration to time of 
transfer from operating room to recovery room or PACU. 
• Clinical laboratory tests  (including hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis) will be obtained at 6 [±2] 
hours post start study drug administration for shipment to central laboratory . 
• Obtain 12-lead ECG at 6 [±2] hours post start study drug administration.  
• In the post- anesthesia care unit (PACU), once the subject is alert and oriented, repeat NRS for recall of 
pain at time of study drug administration and assess surgical awareness with recall using the Brice Awareness Questionnaire ( Appendix 4). The assess ment  time and result should be recorded.  
• Information about any AEs and concomitant mediations will be collected and recorded.  
• After the surgery, subjects may remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748545]; however, if the subject is clinically stable after the Day [ADDRESS_1023606] return to the clinic for the 
24-hour follow-up visit (Day 2). 
For the 24-hour follow- up (Day 2) visit, study assessments and procedures will be assessed as indicated in the

• Information about any AEs and concomitant mediations will be collected and recorded. 
Day 8: Phone Contact  
• Subjects will be evaluated by a follow-up telephone call 7 [±2] days after surgery. 
• Surgical awareness with recall will be re- assessed using the Brice Awareness Questionnaire.  
• Information about any AEs and associated medications will be collected and recorded.  
Population PK study:  
• All eligible subjects in this clinical study will be required to provide venous blood samples for population 
PK study per time schedule planned ( Appendix  5).  
Data monitoring committee: 
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will be involved in the conduct of the study to ensure the 
safety of all subjects who have been administered study drug. The DMC will consist of 3 unblinded members: 2 anesthesiolog ists with appropriate clinical expertise and 1 statistician. The DMC will review all available 
unblinded safety information at approximately 30% enrollment. Additionally, enrollment will be immediately 
stopped after one death 
during the study  where a clear  alternative cause is not readily apparent (i.e., deemed 
definitely or likely related to study drug); after 4 (4/399 [1%] ) non- fatal serious adverse events (SAEs) where a 
clear alternative cause is not readily apparent (i.e., deemed definitely or likely related to study drug); or after 8 
(8/399 [2%]) severe AEs of special interest (AESIs; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade 3  or 4) of severe  hypotension, bradycardia, hypoxia due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] , or QTc prolongation 
occurring within 15 minutes of study drug administration, where a clear alternative cause is not readily apparent (i.e., deemed definitely or likely related to study drug), and lasting ≥10 minute duration despi[INVESTIGATOR_748546]. AESIs of allergy/anaphylaxis or cardiac arrhythmia occurring from the initial dose of study drug until Day 2 where a clear alternative cause is not readily apparent will be evaluated as part of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418].
 
If these criteria are met, enrollment will be temporarily suspended while the DMC convenes to review all 
available unblinded data. Based on recommendations from the DMC, the Sponsor can terminate the study or 
resume enrollment if measures can be taken to e ffectively address (i.e., mitigate) the risk to safely continue the 
study, such as revising inclusion/exclusion criteria or study procedures. The final decision to suspend enrollment or proceed will be made by [CONTACT_748591]. Conduct of the DMC is described in the DMC Charter.    
Number of subjects: A total of 399 subjects; 266 subjects in HSK3486 group and 133 subjects in propofol group.  
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion and exclusion:  
Inclusion criteria: 
Subjects must satisfy all the following criteria at the screening and Day 1 visit s: 
1. Subjects undergoing elective surgery (non emergency, non cardiothoracic, and non in tracranial  surgery, 
anticipated to last at least 1 hour) requir ing endotracheal intubation and inhalation general anesthesia during

Page 17 of 110 Pharmacokinetic endpoints:  
Plasma HSK3486 concentration at scheduled timepoints ( Appendix  5). 
Sample size evaluation:  
A total of 399 subjects ( 266 in HSK3486 0.4/0.2 mg/kg group and 133 in propofol 2.0/1.0 mg/kg group) need to 
be enrolled 2:1 into this study based on the following assumptions: 
• For the primary endpoint, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1023617] 90% power (providing the primary 
endpoint is statistically significant)  assuming that type I error is 0.025 (1- sided), the success rate of general 
anesthesia induction of HSK3486 and propofol are both 97%, and non- inferiority margin (NIM) is -8%. 
• For the key secondary endpoint of incidence of injection- site pain, a sample size of 365 patients will give 90% 
power (providing the primary endpoint is statistically significant)  assuming α= 0.015 (2 -sided) and the 
proportion of subjects who meet the endpoint criteria of any injection- site pain are 6.8% and 20.5% for 
HSK3486 and propofol, respectively. 
• For the key secondary composite endpoint, a sample size of 338 patients will give 90% power (providing the 
primary endpoint is statistically significant) to the superior testing, assuming α= 0.035 (2 -sided), the 
proportion of subjects with successful induction, maintained desired depth of anesthesia for general elective surgery, without significant cardiac depression within the 15-minute post initiation start of study drug administration observation period and no significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] (prior to administration of rocuronium bromide) of HSK3486 and propofol are 82% and 65%, respectively (i.e., 17% treatment effect).  
To power statistical testing for all three endpoints at 90% and provide sufficient safety data, it is decided that 399 
patients will be randomized and treated in this study (266 in HSK3486 0.4/0.2 mg/kg group and 133 in propofol 
2.0/1.0 mg/kg group ).  
Statistical methods:  
Statistical analysis sets:  
Full Analysis Set (FAS): All randomized subjects who have received any dose of the study drug (HSK3486 or 
propofol). 
Per Protocol Set (PPS):  All subjects from FAS who have completed primary efficacy endpoint mea surement will 
be considered for PPS. Subjects with any important protocol deviations will be reviewed after database lock and 
prior to study unblinding and may be excluded from PPS if these  important deviations will impact the efficacy 
evaluations. 
Safety Set (SS): Includes all randomized subjects who have received any dose of the study drug and have post-
dose safety assessment data.

Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_135668]: number of subjects (n), mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Frequency of subjects or events and percentages will 
be summarized in categorical variables.  
Efficacy analysis:  
(a) Primary efficacy analysis 
• Success rate of general anesthesia indu ction in both groups and rate difference between groups and its 
95% confidence interval (CI) are estimated by [CONTACT_103209] -Manning method in the FAS. The lower limit of 
95% CI of rate difference will be compared with the non -inferiority margin of -8% to conf irm the 
establishment of non -inferiority. FAS subjects who are non-evaluable for anesthesia induction will be 
counted as treatment failures. 
(b) Secondary efficacy analysis  
• The 2 key secondary endpoints will be analyzed in parallel. The proportion of subjects with successful 
induction, who maintain desired depth of anesthesia for general elective surgery, and without significant 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] (prior to administration of rocuronium bromide) and cardiac depression between the time of successful induction and [ADDRESS_1023618] study drug administration in both groups and the 
difference between groups and 95% CI will be calculated. The p-value for comparison between groups 
will be obtained based on Chi- square test.  
• The proportion of the subjects with any injection- site pain (NRS ≥1) and moderate injection- site pain 
(NRS ≥4) will be analyzed, as well as the mean NRS score for each treatment group
, using the same 
method as stated above for the secondary composite endpoint.   
• The median and its 95% CI of time to successful induction of general anesthesia will be provided by [CONTACT_748595]- Meier (KM) method.  
• Time to the disappearance of eyelash reflex will be analyzed using similar statistical methods as time to successful induction of general anesthesia.  
• The change of BIS during the period of anesthesia post study drug administration up to 15 minutes will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].  
• Recall of awareness during surgery, assessed postoperatively, will be evaluated using the Brice Awareness Questionnaire. 
• The use of study drugs and rescue drugs will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570]. 
• The proportion of subjects with successful induction without non-optimal anesthetic effects within [ADDRESS_1023619] initiation of administration of study drugs will be analyzed using the similar statistical 
methods as for the secondary composite efficacy endpoint.  
Safety analysis:  
 
All AEs will be coded according to the MedDRA version 24.0 or later and graded for severity according to 
CTCAE version 5.0. The number and percentage of subjects with treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs),

in the Safety en dpoints. 
Population PK analysis:  
The plasma concentration data from this study will be pooled with data from other clinical trials of HSK3486 to 
establish a population PK model. This model will be used to evaluate the effects of internal and external covariates on the PK of HSK3486.

the top -up dose . If MOAA/S is still >1 at 2 minutes [±10 seconds ] post end of the top- up dose, then the rescue 
drug, propofol  (100% of the initial calculated dose) , will be given (in both treatment groups) . The MOAA/S will 
be evaluated every 30 [±10] seconds post end of rescue drug administration until MOAA/S ≤[ADDRESS_1023623] be initiated 5 minutes [±30 seconds ] post midazolam preinduction

evaluated >1.  
d. Prior to entering the OR, orient the subject to the use of th e NRS assessment. Upon initiation of study drug 
administration , the investigator should immediately ask the subject to rate his or her pain. As a general 
guidance, the evaluation should be done multiple times with the first evaluation occurring typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] w ithin 15 
seconds after initiation of study drug injection and monitored until successful induction (MOAA/S ≤1). Related information such as the occurrence and severity of injection pain (NRS 0- 10) shall be recorded. The maximum 
(highest value) injection -site pain should be recorded. Pain during the injection of study drug in the hand/arm 
should be distinguished from unrelated puncture pain from the IV site or due to adhesive tape at the IV site.  When injection pain occurs, the subject’s pain should be graded verbally using the NRS (0- 10) and should be 
recorded. The subject should be asked to rate the pain on a scale from 0, which is no pain, to 10, which is the worst pain imaginable. Ask the subject to point to the number on the scale that best represents the intensity of the pain now. In the PACU, once the subject is alert and oriented, repeat NRS for recall of pain at time of study drug administration.  
e. At preinduction, attach BIS monitor to subject .
 Record the three most recent BIS values before midazolam 
administration . Also, record baseline BIS value prior to administering study drug. The BIS values will be 
collected at the following timepoints at  start of initial study drug administration : every 30 [±10] seconds until 5 
minutes, then every 2 minutes [± 30 seconds ] until 30 minutes  and then every 30 [±2] minutes for the duration 
of the surgery. 
f. Obtain 12- lead ECG at Day 1 visit only if the screening ECG is more than 1  week from the Day 1 visit. During  
the surgery, 3- lead or 5- lead ECG will be monitored continuously and the investigators will decide whether to 
add a 12 -lead ECG. A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained at 6 [±2] hours post study drug administration and as 
clinically indicated.  
g. When MOAA/S ≤1 is reached, IV rocuronium bromide (0.6 mg/kg) is to be administered for neuromuscular 
blockade to perform endotracheal intubation. RR collected until initiation of administration of rocuronium. Intubate subject once neuromuscular blockade  (rocuronium) has taken effect; if using twitch monitor, intubate 
once no twitches are noted. The start and end of first and subsequent intubation attempt time should be recorded.  
h. An inhalational anesthetic agent, Sevoflurane (an inhalation anesthetic agent) will be used for maintenance of general anesthesia. Initiate sevoflurane within 60 seconds after successful endotracheal intubation. The end -tidal 
concentration  of sevoflurane  should be 1.5- 2.0% (The initial concentration that is set and start time of 
administration should be recorded).
 
i. After the surgery, subjects may remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748556]; however, if the subject is clinically stable after the  Day [ADDRESS_1023624] return to the clinic for the 24- hour follow -up 
visit (Day 2).

Sponsor Reference: HSK3486 -[ADDRESS_1023633] widely used intravenous (IV) anesthetics in clinical procedures. It 
induces anesthesia effectively, produces a short duration of anesthesia that allows subjects to recover quickly, and is widely used in the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia for surgery and out subject surgical procedures. However, propofol also comes with pronounced 
shortcomings, in particular, pain on injection [ 1], propofol -induced decrease in diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] [ 2], and excessive lipid 
intake causing subjects to suffer from disorders of lipid metabolism, etc. 
HSK3486 injectable emulsion (hereinafter referred to as HSK3486) is a new IV anesthetic drug 
developed by [CONTACT_748597]., Ltd. HSK3486 is intended to be used in the 
induction of adult sedation/general anesthesia. HSK3486 has a novel structural design that provides higher potency compared to propofol, and potentially results in less site pain and cardiopulmonary instability. Clinical data to date demonstrated HSK3486 signi ficantly reduces 
pain on injection and reduces hypotensive effects while still providing anesthesia induction rates equivalent to propofol. 
1.1. Study Rationale 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, propofol-controlled, Phase 3 clinical study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of HSK3486 for induction of general anesthesia in adults 
undergoing elective surgery with endotracheal intubation. The objective of this study is to 
demonstrate that HSK3486 is non-inferior to propofol in the induction of general anesthesia and, furthermore, to demonstrate better anesthetic effects (i.e., desired depth of anesthesia) compared to propofol with potential for less cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. Clinical signs of inadequate 
depth of sedation during endotracheal intubation include tachycardia, hypertensive response, 
preserved reflexes (e.g., coughing), bronchospasm, movement on painful stimuli, and a bispectral index (BIS) score >60 ( Appendix 2). Ca rdiovascular responses have been found to be 
sensitive indicators of noxious stimuli (e.g., endotracheal intubation) during general anesthesia 
[3,4]. The primary endpoint is successful induction of anesthesia defined by [CONTACT_748598]’s 
Assessment of Awareness/Sedation (MOAA/S) ≤1 without >[ADDRESS_1023634] initiation of the study drug administration, which is defined by 
[CONTACT_748599]: no lacrimation,  movement, vomiting, coughing, laryngospasm, 
bucking, swallowing reflex and/or bronchospasm, etc.; no blood pressure (BP) increase >20% 
from baseline; and a BIS score <60. Furthermore, subjects must not exhibit a decrease in BP requiring intervention, or significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_748558]. Incorporating these criteria into a composite endpoint

Sponsor Reference: HSK3486 -[ADDRESS_1023635]- dose as 
indicated by [CONTACT_748600] >20% or heart rate (HR) >30% from baseline, or BIS score >60 
(HSK3486 24% compared to propofol 46%, p=0.0026). These data support using the composite 
secondary endpoint and thus has the ability to show a statistically significant difference between HSK3486 versus propofol in achieving the desired depth of anesthesia for induction of general anesthesia.  
1.2. Background 
Induction of general anesthesia refers to the transition in a patient's status from an awake state to an anesthesia state in which the patient can then be operated.  
Propofol is widely used clinically and has become the most commonly used IV anesthetic for the 
induction of general anesthesia in clinical practice due to its fast onset, rapid recovery, high 
clearance, and convenient target -controlled I V slow injection. However, when propofol is given 
at its traditional induction dose (2.0-2.5 mg/kg), a single loading dose can cause severe hemodynamic fluctuations, resulting in a significant drop in the patient’s blood pressure, i.e., 
15% to 40% [ 6,7], especially in elderly patients [ 8]. At the same time, the incidence of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_748559]; in addition, as the most common 
adverse reaction of propofol [ 5], injection -site pain increases the stress and anxiety of the patient, 
directly or indirectly affecting the smoothness of anesthesia induction. Due to these shortcomings, a new and more advantageous sedative/anesthetic is needed in the market. 
Pain on injection is one of the key indicators in clinical trials. Methods employed in many 
clinical practices to alleviate pain on propofol injection  have demonstrated negligible effects [ 1]. 
Pain on propofol injection is widely believed to be related to the aqueous phase concentration of the drug in the lipid emulsion formulation [ 9].  
The active ingredient HSK3486 is a chemical entity similar to propofol. It is a single diastereomer with 2 R -type chiral centers; the strategy in the medicinal design of HSK3486 is to 
realize systematic improvement in the pharmacological and physicochemical properties of the drug-receptor binding, thereby [CONTACT_225243] a compound that is expected to be clinically superior 
to propofol. HSK3486 has the pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of fast onset and quick 
stable recovery. HSK3486 has better target selectivity and higher in vitro and in vivo activities than propofol, and its potency is approximately 4 to 5 times that of propofol; the free HSK3486 concentration in water phase measured by "ultrafiltration" is lower than that of propofol (MCT

Page 33 of 110 Fresenius), suggesting that the injection pain of HSK3486 may be reduced or eliminated versus 
propofol. 
The primary mechanism of action for HSK3486 is to enable chloride ion influx by [CONTACT_748601]-mediated ion channel, so as to inhibit the central nervous system. This channel is also a major target of propofol action. 
As of Sept  2022, [ADDRESS_1023636] been completed and 
4 are ongoing or planned. Among the 26 completed studies, a total of 1202 were enrolled in the 
HSK3486 group for observation (94 in Australia + 1108 in China), including 286 healthy subjects  (including 24 elderly), [ADDRESS_1023637] on the circulatory system.  
HSK3486 was approved by [CONTACT_748602] "Sedation in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy" and 
"Induction of General Anesthesia" on December 11, 2020 and February 2, 2021, respectively. The NDA registration applications for the indications of "sedation for bronchoscopy diagnosis and treatment" and "general anesthesia induction and maintenance" were accepted by [CONTACT_748603], 2021 and June, 2021, respectively.

Brochure [ 10]. 
1.3. Benefit -risk Assessment  
To date, [ADDRESS_1023638] been exposed to HSK3486. Analysis of data from 1202 subjects has 
been completed. HSK3486 was generally safe and well tolerated. HSK3486 had better performance than propofol, as manifested by [CONTACT_716]: the types of adverse reactions were generally comparabl e with those of propofol but with a slightly lower incidence; however, the 
incidence of injection-site pain was significantly lower than propofol, the incidence of dizziness and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -related AEs as well as the proportion of subjects in need of airwa y management 
were lower than propofol, the incidence and extent of AEs of cardiovascular depression were comparable to those of propofol.

to or slightly better than that of propofol (refer to Propofol US PI 2017), and potency approximately [ADDRESS_1023640] ive 
surgery; it meets the needs of general anesthesia induction during surgery well.  
To date, HSK3486 has been shown to be a safe and effective sedative/anesthetic in prior clinical 
trials that is suitable for induction of general anesthesia.  
Phase III s tudies in the US will be conducted to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
HSK3486. In these Phase [ADDRESS_1023641] experience in general anesthesia. 
Changes in vital signs will be closely monitored during anesthesia, and corresponding risk preventions and control measures will be implemented for known drug reactions such as hypotension and sinus bradycardia, so as to ensure the safety of subjec ts in clinical studies. An 
independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will be involved in the conduct of this study to maintain the safety of all subjects dosed with the study drug. 
In summary, the safety profile of propofol has been well described based on its clinical use over 
the past several decades. In 24 clinical studies thus far, HSK3486 has demonstrated a safety 
profile comparable to propofol, with potentially less cardiopulmonary instability, coupled with 
the additional benefit of less injection -site pain. The favorable benefit -risk assessment supports 
the continued evaluation of HSK3486 for induction of general anesthesia. 
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of HSK3486 may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure [ 10].

3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan Description  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, propofol-controlled, Phase 3 clinical study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of HSK3486 for induction of general anesthesia in adults 
undergoing elective surgery with endotracheal intubation.  
After screen ing, e ligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either HSK3486 
0.4/0.2 mg/kg (i.e., 0.4 mg/kg IV slow injection over 30 [±5] seconds followed by [CONTACT_33018] 
0.2 mg/kg dose if needed) or propofol 2.0/1.0 mg/kg (i.e., 2.0 mg/kg IV slow injection over 30 [±5] seconds followed by [CONTACT_33018] 1.0 mg/kg dose if needed) in a blinded manner. Enrolled 
subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_748605] (ASA -PS; I -II 
and III- IV), age (<65 and >65 years), and Body Mass Index (BMI<35 and ≥35 kg/m
2). 
Endotracheal intubation will be performed after adequate anesthetic induction (Modified 
Observer’s Assessment of Awareness/Sedation [MOAA/S] ≤1) ( Appendix 1) has been achieved 
and adm
inistration of neuromuscular blocking agent. 
On Day 1 , premedication is allowed prior to induction except for sedative hypnotics, analgesics 
(eg., opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], NSAIDs, APAP) , or any medications that r elieve pain  (eg., Gabapentin), unless 
otherwise specified in the protocol. Premedication should be recorded if used. 
Assessments and procedures completed prior to the administration of the study drug in the 
operating room, the preinduction period, induction period, maintenance period and the follow-up period can be found in Section 7 – Study Assessments and Procedures . 
Population PK Study  
All eligible subjects in this clinical study will be required to provide ve nous blood samples for 
population PK study per time schedule planned ( Appendix 5).  
3.2. Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
Propofol is selected as the rescue/alternat ive drug (trade name: [CONTACT_700892]). Given that propofol is 
the most common IV drug for anesthesia, should induction fail, the investigator, based on the 
status of the subject, should give propofol as the first choice of rescue medication; however, 
based on the discretion of the investigator, an alternative drug may be administered at the appropriate dose and timing as determined by [CONTACT_093]. 
The population in this study includes subjects undergoing elective surgeries that require 
endotracheal intubatio n under general anesthesia. For safety considerations, subjects undergoing 
emergency, cardiothoracic, and intracranial surgeries are excluded.

3.4. Selection of Doses in the Study  
3.4.1. Selection of Dose for HSK3486 
By [CONTACT_748606]-ascending group and the extension stage (primary) in the 
Phase II study of HSK3486 for induction of general anesthesia, the following can be seen that:  
 Dose selection: Although the efficacy of the 0.5mg/kg HSK3486 group was comparable to 
that of the 2.0mg/kg propofol group, the efficacy of the 0.5mg/kg HSK3486 group was slightly better than that of the 0.3mg/kg and 0.4mg/kg HSK3486 groups, as manifested by a 
faster rate of successful induction and a shorter intubation time. In addition, the 0.5mg/kg 
HSK3486 group did not need top-up doses. However, the safety of the 0.5mg/kg HSK3486 group was slightly worse, as manifested by a larger decrease in BP, higher incidence of injection pain than 0.3 mg/kg HSK3486, and more cases of transient and prolonged QT 
interval. The 0.3mg/kg HSK3486 group showed better safety and a relatively small 
proportion of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). However, compared with the propofol group, the 0.3mg/kg group had longer time to successful induction, more obvious intubation reactions, and larger fluctuations in BP and HR, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of 
0.3 mg/kg HSK3486 on intubation reactions is not strong enough. At a suitable dose, 
HSK3486 can be used to induce general anesthesia with a reliable efficacy and safety profile. Based on above considerations, it is reasonable to choose the dose of 0.4 mg/kg (initial dose)/0.2 mg/kg (top-up dose) as the recommended HSK3486 dose for Phase III clinical studies. 
 Number of top-up doses and dosing interval: Based on the results of Phase II study for induction of general anesthesia, during induction, 1 (1/8) subject in the dose-escalation group (HSK3486 0.4/0.2mg/kg group) received 1 top-up dose of study drug, and 1 (1/22) subject in the dose-extension stage (0.3/0.15mg/kg group) received 1 top-up dose of study drug. The 
time to successful induction was about 0.71 to 1 minute. Therefore, in the design of Phase III 
study on induction of general anesthesia, the top-up dose is set at 1 minute ±[ADDRESS_1023645] failed. 
 Criteria for the selection of top -up dose: The criteria for a top -up dose in the Phase III study 
of induction of general anesthesia are based on the results of the previous Phase II and III studies in China and are determined according to the MOAA/S score, i.e., if MOAA/S ≤1 is not reached, a top -up dose is required. 
 A 25% dose reduction is required for elderly subjects ≥65 years of age for both HSK3486

Page 40 of 110 and propofol.  For elderly subjects ≥65 years of age , the dose will be automaticall y adjusted 
to a 25% dose reduction. According to the judgment of the investigator, the dose can be 
further reduced by [CONTACT_8622] 50%. For ASA grade 3-4 subjects, the dose can be reduced by 25-
50% per investigator discretion. The administration  time should be extended to 1 minute for 
these populations.  
 Data from a PK study in elderly subjects (Study HSK3486-108) suggests that there are no 
significant differences in the PK exposures at 0.4 mg/kg between elderly (≥65 years old) and non-elderly (<65 years old), consistent with physiologically based PK modeli ng results. A 
similar efficacy and safety profile was also demonstrated between 0.3 mg/kg elderly and 0.4 
mg/kg non-elderly. Of note, both propofol US and [LOCATION_006] labels currently recommend a 25% 
dose reduction in subjects 65 or older. 
  The HSK3486 dose will be modified for obese subjects: for subjects with BMI ≤40 
kg/m2, 
total body weight (TBW) will be used to determine dose; for subjects with BMI >40 kg/m2, 
lean body weight (LBW) will be used to determine dose. 
 Based on population PK (PopPK) modeling, subjects with BMI >45  kg/m2 can be expected to 
have higher simulated maximum concentration (C max) and area-under-the- curve (AUC [0-24 h]) 
than the PK exposure identified in the Phase 1 single-ascending-dose studies. 
 In obese subjects, fat mass and LBW do not increase proportionately. Obese subjects have both an increased amount of fat and LBW; however, LBW accounts for as much as 20% to 40% of the excess TBW. The LBW has been shown to correlate with cardiac output, which is an important determinant in the early distribution kinetics of drugs. Based on published literature, LBW is the ideal weight scalar for drug administration in subjects with BMI >40 
[11, 12].  
 The anesthetic PD response in subjects with BMI >40 kg/m2 is likely to be different. It has 
been reported that morbidly obese subjects have significantly decreased half- maximal 
effective concentration (EC 50) values compared to control subjects, which suggests increased 
brain sensitivity to propofol in the morbidly obese population [ 13, 14].  
3.4.2. Selection of Dose for Propofol 
Propofol has the characteristics of fast onset, rapid recovery, high clearance, and convenient 
target -controlled slow injection. It has become the most commonly used IV anesthetic in clinical 
practice. Among various propofol products, Diprivan is the most widely used both domestically and overseas; therefore, propofol is selected as the positive control drug.  
Rationale for the selection of the initial and top -up doses of propofol:  
In the packaging insert of propofol [ 9], the dose for inducing general anesthesia is 2.0 to 2.5 
mg/kg. The results of the dose-ascending and extension stages of Phase II trials on induction of 
general anesthesia by [CONTACT_748607]3486 showed the propofol 2.0 to 2.5mg/kg group had a 100% success

Page 41 of 110 rate in induction of general anesthesia with good safety and tolerability. Among them, 2.5 mg/kg 
was found to have a higher incidence of ADRs during dose escalation, so 2.0 mg/kg was selected 
as the control dose in the extension stage; in summary, to better compare the differences in the efficacy and safety of HSK3486 and propofol, 2.0 mg/kg of propofol has been selected as the initial dose, and the top up- dose is the same as that in the design of the Phase II study on 
induction of general anesthesia, i.e., 1.0 mg/kg. 
The propofol dose will be modified for obese subjects to match HSK3486 dosing regimens due 
to similar rationales as HSK3486 noted above: for subje cts with BMI ≤40 
kg/m2, TBW will be 
used to determine dose; for subjects with BMI >40 kg/m2, LBW will be used to determine dose. 
3.5. Data Monitoring Committee 
An independent DMC will be involved in the conduct of the study to ensure the safety and well-being of all subjects who have been administered study drug is maintained. The DMC will consist of 3 unblinded members: 2 anesthesiologists with appropriate clini cal expertise and 1 
statistician. The DMC will review all available unblinded safety information at approximately 30% enrollment. Additionally, enrollment will be immediately stopped after one death during the study where a clear alternative cause is not r eadily apparent (i.e., deemed definitely or likely 
related to study drug); after 4 (4/399 [1%]) non -fatal serious adverse events (SAEs) where a clear 
alternative cause is not readily apparent (i.e., deemed definitely or likely related to study drug); or after 8 (8/399 [2%]) severe AEs of special interest (AESIs; Common Terminology Criteria [CTCAE] Grade 3 and 4) of severe hypotension, bradycardia, hypoxia due to  respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826], or QTc prolongation occurring within 15 minutes of study drug administration, where a clear alternative cause is not readily apparent (i.e., deemed definitely or likely related to 
study drug), and lasting ≥10 minute duration despi[INVESTIGATOR_748564]. AESIs of 
allergy/anaphylaxis or cardiac arrhythmia occurring from the initial dose of study drug until Day 2 where a clear alternative cause is not readily apparent will be evaluated as part of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] . If these criteria are met, enrollment will be temporarily suspended while the DMC 
convenes to review all available unblinded data. Based on recommendations from the DMC, the Sponsor can terminate the study or resume enrollment if measures can be taken to effectively address (i.e., mitigate) the risk to safely continue the study, such as revising inclusion/exclusion criteria or study procedures. The final decision to suspend enrollment or proceed will be made by 
[CONTACT_748608]. Conduct of the DMC is described in the DMC Charter.

Drug Preparation  
On the day of drug administration, the non-blinded preparation personnel wil l locate the 
corresponding study drug according to the drug number applied by [CONTACT_80356] (IXRS) and convert the drug volume according to formula below; the drug will then be drawn into a certain number of syringes (1 initial dose + 1 top-up dose). In addition, the required 
alternative (rescue) drug for the subjects is also prepared.  
The non-blinded administration personnel will check the drug information recorded by [CONTACT_748614]. Both the drug volume calculation and drug preparation processes should be documented in the drug dispensing record form.  
Staff for drug preparation and administration are non-blinded and must not disclose subject administration information to investigators, subjects, or any other blind personnel. 
Doses and method of administration for HSK3486 are as below: 
Volume of initial/top -up dose = dose group (mg/kg) x baseline body weight (kg) ÷ 2.5 mg/mL. 
HSK3486 is administered by [CONTACT_2329] 30 [±5] seconds of slow injection. If a top-up dose is 
required, 50% of the initial dose is given via slow injection over 10 [±2] seconds. 
For elderly subjects ≥65 years of age, the dose will be automatically adjusted to a 25% dose 
reduction. According to the judgment of the investigator, the dose can be further reduced by [CONTACT_25765] 50% of the calculated dose. The administration time should be extended to 1 minute for this 
population.

Page 51 of 110 For ASA grade 3-4 subjects, the dose can be reduced by 25-50% per investigator discretion. T he 
administration time should be extended to 1 minute for th ese populations.  
For subjects with BMI ≤40 kg/m2, TBW will be used to determine HSK3486 dose; for subjects 
with BMI >40 kg/m2, LBW will be used to determine HSK3486 dose, and Rescue dose. LBW 
should be calculated using the Janmahasatian  formula included below. 
The Janmahasatian Formula:  
• For males: LBW = (9270 x TBW (kg))/(6680 + (216 x BMI))  
• For females: LBW = (9270 x TBW (kg))/(8780 + (244 x BMI)) 
Doses and method of administration for propofol are as below: 
Volume of initial/top -up dose of propofol = dose group (mg/kg) x baseline body weight (kg) ÷ 
10 mg/mL. The method of administration of propofol is the same as that of HSK3486. 
For elderly subjects ≥65 years of age, the dose will be automatically adjusted to a 25% dose 
reduction. According to the judgment of the investigator, the dose can be further reduced by [CONTACT_25765] 50% of the calculated do se. The administration time should be extended to 1 minute for this 
population. 
For ASA grade 3-4 subjects, the dose can be reduced by 25-50% per investigator discretion. T he

For subjects with BMI ≤40 kg/m2, TBW will be used to determine propofol dose; for subjects 
with BMI >40 kg/m2, LBW will be used to determine propofol dose, and Rescue dose. LBW 
should be calculated using the Janmahasatian formula included be low. 
The Janmahasatian Formula:  
• For males: LBW = (9270 x TBW (kg))/(6680 + (216 x BMI))  
• For females: LBW = (9270 x TBW (kg))/(8780 + (244 x BMI)) 
 
The rescue dose is prepared as 100% of the initial calculated dose and administered per propofol 
guidelines above.  
5.3. Method of Treatment Assignment  
The randomization of the subjects in this study is completed using the IXRS. After the subjects pass the screening, the investigator(s) or designee shall log into the IXRS and enter the general information of each subject, such as the screening number, sex, age, height, and body weight, to

group are assigned using the IXRS and submitted to the drug preparation personnel (non-
blinded) for drug preparation. The non- blinded site staff will have to log into the IXRS to obtain 
the kit numbers and dosages. 
Study treatment will be dispensed at baseline visit summarized in the Schedule of Assessments.  
5.3.1. Dose Modification 
Dosage adjustments are not allowed unless these conditions are stipulated in the protocol. For  
elder
ly subjects ≥65 years of age, the dose will be automatically  adjusted to a 25% dose 
reduction. According to the judgment of the investigator, the dose can be further reduced by [CONTACT_25765] 50% of the calculated dose. For ASA grade 3-4 subjects, the dose can be reduced by 25-50% 
per investigator discretion. The administration time should be extended to 1 minute for th ese 
populations. Both the HSK3486 and the propofol doses will be modified for morbidly obese subjects: For 
subje
cts with BMI ≤40 kg/m2, TBW will be used to determine dose; for subjects with BMI >40 
kg/m2, LBW will be used to determin e dose.  
5.4. Blinding  
This is a double-blind study. The IXRS will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. The study blind may be broken if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], it is in the subject’s best 
interest to know the study treatment assignment. Sponsor must be notified before the blind is broken unless identification of the study treatment is required for a medical emergency in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study treatment will affect the immediate management of the subject’s condition (e.g., antidote is available). In this case, Sponsor must be notified within 
[ADDRESS_1023661] be 
recorded in the source documentation and eCRF, as applicable. 
The study staff are divided into 2 groups: blinded and non-blinded. The study ensures that the 
investigators, subjects, and the entire operating process of the study are blinded. 
Blinded staff include the principal investigator, study nurse, clinical research coordinator, 
blinded CRA, and all the other personnel involved in the documentation, assessment, analysis, and review of efficacy/safety endpoint data. These staff are primarily responsible for all study procedures other than drug management (such as subject screening, documentation, assessment, 
analysis, and review of efficacy and safety endpoints). 
The non-blinded staff are responsible for the management, preparation, and administration of the 
study drug. Detailed descriptions of blinding procedures are described in the Blinding Plan.

7.1. Study Procedures  
7.1.1. Screening Period (Day -13 to Day 1) 
During the screening period and before the investigator conducts any study procedures, he/she 
will discuss with subjects their clinical condition, the commonly used anesthesia methods, the characteristics of the study drug, and the possible adverse reactions that can be caused by [CONTACT_50463]. The subjects will sign the ICF and receive a signed copy.  
After signing the ICF, the subject will be assigned a screening number, and the following 
procedures/evaluations will be conducted as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments: 
 Assess inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 Demographics. 
 Collect medical history (disease history, allergy history, alcohol history and surgical 
anesthesia history, etc.).  
 Prior medications.  
 Modified Mallampati score assessment ( Appendix 7).  
 Physical examination, including ASA- PS score ( Appendix 6).  
 Vital signs (HR, RR, SpO 2, SBP, DBP, MAP , Temp ) after the subject has been resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_243332] ≥5 minutes. 
 Height, weight, and calculated BMI. 
 12-lead ECG.  
 Clinical laboratory tests (hematology , blood chemistry, and urinalysis , etc.).  
 HbA1c and TSH test (with free T -4 if TSH abnormal) will only be done during the screening 
period.   
 Conduct serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test (for women of childbearing 
potential only). 
 Instruct subject to fast at least 6 hours before surgery. Per investigator discretion, in 
otherwise healthy patients, clear liquids may be ingested for up to 2 hours prior to surgery. These liquids should not include alcohol. Examples of clear liquids include, but are not limited to, water and fruit juices without pulp, carbonated beverages , carbohydrate -rich 
nutritional drinks, clear tea, and black coffee.  
 Document AEs (after signing informed consent).  
During screening, the preference is for laboratory tests to be processed centrally  to confirm 
eligibility . However, in cases where a separate screening visit is not feasible or the central

7.1.2. Day of Surgery (Day 1) 
Enrolled subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_748590] 
(ASA -PS; I -II and III-IV), age (<65 and ≥ 65 years), and Body Mass Index (BMI <35 and ≥ 35 
kg/m2). 
Height, weight, and BMI will be obtained prior to dosing study drug. The most recent BMI will 
be used to calculate study drug dose. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either HSK3486 0.4/0.2 mg/kg (i.e., 0.4 mg/kg IV slow injection over 30 [±5] seconds followed by [CONTACT_33018] 0.2 mg/kg IV top-up dose if needed) or propofol 2.0/1.0 mg/kg (i.e., 
2.0 mg/kg IV slow injection over 30 [± 5] seconds followed by [CONTACT_33018] 1.0 mg/kg top-up 
dose if needed) in a blinded manner. 
All throughout the preinduction and induction periods a timing device must be used to allow 
accuracy and sequencing of necessary assessments.  
On the day of surgery, the following procedures as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments  will 
occur:  
Prior to entering the operating room: 
• Refer to  7.1.1 for certain cases where local lab s may be drawn to confirm eligibility . 
 Measure vital signs (HR, RR, SpO 2, SBP, DBP, MAP , Temp ) to confirm consistent with 
eligibility criteria (after the subject has been resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] ≥5 minutes).  
 Conduct urine human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test (for  women of childbearing 
potential only). 
 Obtain 12-lead ECG if the screening ECG is more than 1-week from the baseline visit, the 12-lead ECG should be repeated to assess its compliance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 Verify inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 Height, weight, and calculated BMI.

 Orient subject to the use of the NRS pain assessment. 
Preinduction period: 
 Confirm p reoperative readiness (subject is hemodynamically stable and has followed 
preoperative instructions, and there is no evidence of acute illness such as fever). 
 Obtain vital signs (heart rate [HR], respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] [RR], oxygen saturation [SpO 2], systolic 
blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], mean arterial pressure [MAP]), 
Temperature [Temp ]; baseline value will be the measurement immediately prior to initiation 
of study drug administration.  
 Start maintenance IV infusion (NS, LR, or 5% dextrose solution). 
 Attach 3 -lead or 5 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to subject and monitor continuously. In the 
event an abnormality is noted with 3- lead or 5 -lead ECG, clinical significance of an 
abnormality should be documented, and the investigators wil l decide whether to add a 12 -
lead ECG.  
 Administer oxygen via face mask ( ≥4 L/min) at least [ADDRESS_1023668].   
 Attach B IS monitor to subject (either in preoperative anesthesia unit or in operating room, 
depending on local practice). Record the three most recent BIS values preceding midazolam 
administration.

should be recorded once every 1 minute [±15 seconds] from the start of study drug 
administration (for every time point) for [ADDRESS_1023670] start of study drug administration for the judgment of key secondary endpoint. 
Note:  Vital signs (HR, RR, SBP, DBP, MAP , Temp ) monitor should be set to cycle every [ADDRESS_1023671] every 2 minutes (in case cycle requires longer than 1 minute).  
 Administer IV study drug (HSK3486 0.4 mg/k g or propofol 2.0 mg/kg) into vein located  on 
the back of right or left hand (this IV location is  strongly preferred rather than mandatory) at 
a port closest to the IV cannula (IV injection time: 30 [±5] seconds). 
 The MOAA/S will be evaluated every 30 [±10] seconds after end of study drug administration until MOAA/S ≤ 1 is reached . 
 If MOAA/S is still >1 at 1 minute [±10 seconds ] post end of study drug administration, a top -
up dose of 50% of the initial dose of study drug (either HSK3486 0.2 mg/kg or propofol 1 mg/kg depending on treatment group) will be given to the subject (IV injection time: 10 [±2] seconds). Start  and end times of top-up dose administration will be recorded. The 
MOAA/S will be evaluated every 30 [±10] seconds post end of the top-up dose administration.  
 If MOAA/S is still >1 at 2 minutes [±10 seconds ] post end of the top-up dose administration, 
then the rescue drug, propofol, will be given (in both treatment groups). The rescue dose is prepared as th e initial calculated dose (100%) and administered per propofol guidelines. The 
MOAA/S will be evaluated every 30 [±10] seconds post end of rescue drug administration until MOAA/S ≤1 is reached. 
 Administration of study drug must be initiated 5 minutes [±30 seconds] post midazolam preinduction medication administration stop time . Top-up doses should be administered 
within 10 seconds once MOAA/S is evaluated >1 . 
 Injection -site pain is evaluated verbally by [CONTACT_192812] (NRS;  Appendix 3). Upon 
administration  of study drug injection, the investigator should immediately ask the subject to 
rate his or her pain  at injection -site. As a general guidance, the evaluation should be done 
multiple times with the first evaluation occurring typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 15 seconds after initiation 
of study drug injection and monitored until successful induction (MOAA/S ≤1). Related information such as the occurrence and severity of injection pain (NRS 0-10) shall be recorded. The maximum (highest value) injection- site pain will be recorded in EDC as NRS. 
Pain during the injection of study drug in the hand/arm should be distinguished from unrelated punc ture pain from the IV site or due to adhesive tape at the IV site.   
 Post the end of initial study drug administration, the eyelash reflex will be evaluated every 30 
[±10] seconds until loss of eyelash reflex. If there is a top -up dose, eyelash reflex will be 
evaluated every 30 [±10] seconds post end of the top-up dose administration until loss of eyelash reflex. If there is  rescue drug  given, eyelash reflex will be evaluated every 30 [±10]

2.  One or less top-up dose required without using any rescue drugs. 
Scoring criteria: According to the MOAA/S scale ( Appendix  1), observation and evaluation 
are carried out stepwise, and the cross -level evaluation should not be carried out .  
MOAA/S scoring: The subject's name [CONTACT_748632]'s response to name [CONTACT_748633] a normal tone. Lightly stimulate or shake the subject after the subject falls asleep and  observe the subject's response to painful stimulation. If the subject does not respond 
to the light stimulus or shaking but responds to painful stimulation (by [CONTACT_748617]), the MOAA/S score is 1 and the time from the end  of the dosing of the study drug to 
when MOAA/S is ≤1 should be re corded.  
7.2.2. Composite Endpoint to Evaluate Desired Depth of Anesthesia  
Composite endpoint of desired depth of anesthesia for general elective surgery is defined if all following criteria are met:  
 Proportion of successfully induced subjects treated with HSK3486 compared to propofol 
with no any clinical symptoms in response to tracheal intubation, such as lacrimation, movement, vomiting, coughing, laryngospasm, bucking, swallowing reflex or bronchospasm, or an event where no SBP, DBP, or MAP increases more than 20% from baseline in response to any major operational procedures or noxious stimulus in defined period, within  [ADDRESS_1023678] initiation start of study drug administration  or up to the start of second tracheal 
intubation attempt. 
 Subjects maintain desire d depth of anesthesia for general elective surgery within [ADDRESS_1023679] initiation of study drug administration with BIS as an objective assessment (after 
reaching the initial lowest value, BIS remains sustainable level at not more than 60 during 15 
minu tes after study drug administration). 
Note:  Target BIS 40 to 60 for general anesthesia (see Appendix 2 for BIS guidance).  
The BIS sustainable level at not more than 60 is defined as not more than 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_748580] >[ADDRESS_1023680] value, in defined period.

>[ADDRESS_1023681] ion-site pain is evaluated verbally during study drug administration using the NRS, ranging 
from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worse imaginable pain) (see Appendix 3). Recollection of pain during study drug administration will be assessed in the PACU once the subject is awake and oriented. 
During the baseline visit, the subject should be oriented to the NRS for the evaluation of 
injection -site pain. Upon initiation of study drug administration , the investigator should 
immediately ask the subject to rate his or her pain. As a general guidance, the evaluation should 
be done multiple times with the first evaluation occurring typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 15  seconds after 
initiation of study drug administration  and monitore d until successful induction (MOAA/S ≤1). 
Related information such as the occurrence and severity of injection pain (NRS 0-10) shall be recorded. The maximum (highest value) injection-site pain should be recorded. Pain during the injection of study drug in the hand/arm should be distinguished from unrelated puncture pain from the IV site or due to adhesive tape at the IV site.  When injection pain occurs, the 
subject’s pain should be graded verbally using the NRS (0-10) and should be recorded. The 
subject should be asked to rate the pain on a scale from 0, which is no pain, to 10, which is the 
worst pain imaginable. Ask the subject to point to the number on the scale that best represents the intensity of the pain now. In the PACU, once the subject is alert and oriented, repeat NRS for recall of pain at time of study drug administration.  
7.2.4.  Time to Successful Anesthesia Induction  
The time to successful anesthesia induction is evaluated during the induction period and is 
defined as the time from the end of the first administration of the study drug to the time when MOAA/S ≤1.

7.2.7. Changes in the Bispectral Index  
From the start of study drug administration to the end of the surgery, the subjects are 
continuously monitored for their BIS, which is recorded at specified time points to understand the changes in the BIS of the subjects throughout the entire anesthesia period ( see Appendix 2) 
for BIS guidance). 
7.2.8. Brice Awareness Questionnaire 
Recall of awareness during surgery, assessed postoperatively, will be evaluated using the Brice 
Awareness Questionnaire (see Appendix 4).  
7.2.9. Use of Study Drugs and Alternative Drugs 
The use of HSK3486 and propofol (including the time and use of top-up dose, the amount of top-up dose, and the total dose) is evaluated from the end of study drug administration to the time of successful induction. The use of alternative drug (propofol) (including the time and use of top-up dose, the amount of top-up dose, and the total dose), as well as the proportion of subjects using the rescue/remedial drug (propofol), is evaluated from the beginning of the dosing 
of the study drug to the time of successful induction. The proportion of subjects using the 
alternative drug (propofol) will also  be calculated for each dose group.

concerns since your last visit?”  
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the subject 
to discontinue the HSK3486 (see Section 4.3.2).  
When possible, AEs should be reported as the unifying diagnosis rather than individual signs and 
symptoms of an underlying condition (e.g., fever, cough, and elevated white blood cells [WBC] associated with pneumonia should be reported as pneumonia). Laboratory values themselves are 
usually not AEs, especially when a component of the underlying AE (e.g., an elevated WBC 
associated with pneumonia should not be reported as a separate AE). 
AEs Do Not Include the Following:   
 Anesthetic effect -related sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], somnolence, or even loss of consciousness occurring
during administration (i.e., the intended therapeutic effect of the drug under study)
 Chronic diseases that are present before participating in the clinical study
 Elective medical examination or surgery s cheduled prior to enrollment into the study
 Overdose of the study drug or concomitant medication not resulting in any signs or
symptoms
 Lack of efficacy should be captured as a treatment failure for clinical efficacy, not as an AE.
7.3.2.  Reporting S erious Adverse Events 
For the definition of an SAE please see Appendix 9. All SAEs, occurring after the signing of the 
ICF until the end of study and regardless of study drug relationship, must be reported by [CONTACT_748619] C ase R eport Form (eCRF) f orm within the  clinical database ( Medidata R AVE) w ithin

serious  adve rse events t o the IRB/EC. 
In the case of  clinical d atabase outage or  the  site is una ble to acc es s t he system, t he investigators 
will be requested to complete a Safety Event Report Form in English and report it by [CONTACT_748620]     . The facsimile report should include all available information requested on the SAE

[IP_ADDRESS].  Abuse -related AEs of Interest  
Both HSK3486 and propofol cross the blood- brain barrier and have CNS effects, which are the 
intended pharmacological action of the drug (e.g., sedation, anesthesia/unconsciousness). Any 
untoward change from baseline that is not the intended or desired effect of the study drug should be reported as an AE. Investigators and site personnel should monitor for and report abuse-
related AEs of interes t, which include euphoria, dissociative effects, hallucinations, psychosis, 
changes in mood, impaired cognition, attention and psychomotor effects, and inappropriate 
affect,  overdoses, abuse, and misuse.

7.3.4. Contraception and Pregnancy  
Currently, the effects of HSK3486 on the fetus are still unknown. Therefore, female subjects of 
childbearing potential and male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential are require d to adopt appropriate contraceptive measures before (from screening) and during the 
study ([ADDRESS_1023691] study drug administration). For male subjects who have not been sterilized (vasectomy), their female partners of childbearing potential must also use appropriate contraception. Effective contraceptive measures include female bilateral tubal ligation , male 
vasectomy , hormone contraceptives (oral, implanted, injected and transdermal), the combination 
of intrauterine contraceptive device and barrier contraceptive (condoms, cervical caps) or abstinence. Male subjects should refrain from donating sperm from Day [ADDRESS_1023692] who has taken the study drug 
becomes preg nant during the study period (from signing ICF to [ADDRESS_1023693] study drug 
administration ), the investigators should immediately record the pregnancy information and fill 
out a pregnancy-specific report and notify the Contract Research Organization  (CRO) de signated 
by [CONTACT_90614] 24 hours of being informed of the event. The investigators should also 
report the event to the IRB/ EC in accordance with the ethical requirements of each study site.  
The pharmacovigilance personnel of the CRO should review the pregnancy report form in accordance with the standard operating procedures and report it to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_1023694] should withdraw from the study for reasons of protocol deviation. 
A pregnancy event should be followed up to the end of pregnancy or 8 weeks after the fetus is 
born. The follow -up information of pregnancy events is recorded in the source file. 
If pregnancy results meet SAE criteria, i .e., spontaneous abortion, induced abortion, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, and congenital malformations (including deformities in aborted babies), the 
investigator shall report in accordance with the SAE reporting procedure.

and absolute count) including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils; 
red blood cell (RBC) count, Hb, hematocrit (HCT), MCH, MCHC, MCV and platelet count (PLT).  
 Blood biochemistry (about 5 mL of blood sample): liver function (aspartate aminotransferase 
[AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], gamma- glutamyl 
transferase [GGT], total bilirubin [TBIL], total protein [TP], albumin [ALB], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]), blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (triglycerides [TG], cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoprotein [HDL]), electrolytes (sodium [Na], potassium 
[K]), chloride  [Cl], calcium [Ca], phosphorus [P], bicarbonate [HCO3], renal function (uric 
acid [UA], blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine [Cr]), blood glucose (Glu), thyroid 
stimulating hormone [TSH] (free T -4 if TSH is abnormal)  and hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c ]. 
 Urinalysis (about 7 mL of fresh urine sample): color and appearance, urinary protein (PRO), 
urinary glucose (GLU), microscopic exam including urinary WBCs and RBCs, urinary ketone bodies (KET), pH and specific gravity, leukocytes, bilirubin, nitrite, and occult blood. 
Laboratory tests are performed in the screening period and 6 (±2) hours post administration of study drug except for  HbA1c and TSH (with free T -4 if TSH abnormal). HbA1c and TSH are 
only drawn at the screening visit. I n cases where a separate screening visit is not feasible or the 
central laboratory results are not available on Day 1, a study approved local laboratory may be used to confirm eligibility. In these cases, required screening lab oratory  samples must be drawn 
in parallel and sent to the central laboratory.  Local laboratory results  will be maintained in the 
source documents but not be entered into the e CRF.      
For cases where central and local labs are drawn at the same time, blood volumes noted above in 
bullets 1 and 2 will be increased to approximately 15 mL total. U rine volume noted in bullet 3 
will be  increased to approximately  15 mL.  
7.3.6. Vital Signs, Physical Examination, and Other Safety Evaluations 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Vital Signs  
Vital signs include RR, HR, SpO 2, Temp , BP (SBP, DBP, and MAP).   
During screening, vital sign examination should be performed after resting for at least 5 minutes. If the results exceed the inclusion/exclusion criteria and are confirmed after repeated tests, the subject shall not be enrolled. 
For the pre-anesthetic preparation period, after the anesthetic monitor is mounted, baseline vital 
signs values will be the measurement immediately prior to initiation of study drug 
administration .

recorded once every 1 minute [±15 seconds]), and then at 6 [±2] hours post study drug 
administration, and at the 24-hour (Day 2) visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations include skin, head, and neck, cardiovascular system, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], gastrointestinal system, psychological and neurological system, and musculoskeletal system. ASA- PS and Mallampati (oropharyngeal exam) classifications will also be evaluated. These 
assessments will be completed at screening, and a focused physical exam will be repeated as 
needed to asses s AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  12-lead ECG and 3 -lead/5 -lead ECG  
In the 12-lead ECG examination, the values of QT interval, QTcF interval, PR interval, QRS 
interval, RR interval and their clinical significance determinations are recorded.  
The 12-lead ECG examination is done during the screening period. At baseline, if the screening 
ECG is more than 1-week from the baseline visit, the 12-lead ECG should be repeated to assess 
its compliance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria (the result is also used as the baseline value). During the surgery, a 3- lead or 5 -lead ECG (i.e., rhythm strip) is monitored continuously. If the 
3-lead ECG shows clinically significant abnormalities, the investigators will decide whether to 
add a 12-lead ECG based per investigator’s discretion. 
7.3.7. Use of Additi onal Medication or Any Interventions  
Administration of additional medication or any interventions including medical interventions, 
e.g., administration of vasoactive drugs, necessary due to a clinically relevant change in BP, should be documented.  
7.4. Pharmac okinetic Analysis  
To maintain the blind, all subjects should undergo PK blood sampling regardless of their groups. 
However, only the blood samples in the HSK3486 group are tested and analyzed; unless requested by [CONTACT_748621], the propofol group may also be analyzed. 
To ensure the accuracy of the PK data, it is necessary to accurately record the actual start and 
end time of dosing, the dose, and the blood sampling time of each subject.

8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
A total of 399 subjects ( 266 in HSK3486 0.4/0.2 mg/kg group and 133 in propofol 2.0/1.0 mg/kg 
group) need to be enrolled 2:1 into this study based on the following assumptions: 
 For the primary endpoint, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1023696] 90% power 
assuming that type I error is 0.025 (1- sided), the success rate of general anesthesia induction 
of HSK3486 and propofol are both 97%, and non- inferiority margin (NIM) is - 8%. 
 For the key secondary endpoint of incidence of injection- site pain, a sample size of 365 
subjects  will give 90% power (providing the first primary endpoint is statistically significant) 
assuming α=0.015 (2 -sided) and the proportion of subjects who meet the endpoint criteria of 
any injection- site pain are 6.8% and 20.5% for HSK3486 and propofol, respectively. 
 For the key secondary composite endpoint, a sample size of 338 subjects  will give 90% 
power (providing the first primary endpoint is statistically significant) to the superior testing, 
assuming α=0.05 (2-sided), the proportion of subjects with successful induction, maintained desired depth of anesthesia for general elective surgery, without significant cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_748582] [ADDRESS_1023697] initiation start of study drug administration 
observation period and no significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] (prior to administration of rocuronium bromide) of HSK3486 and propofol are 82% and 65%, respectively ( i.e., 17% 
treatment effect).  
To power statistical testing for all three endpoints at 90%  and provide sufficient safety data, 399 
subjects  will be randomized and treated in this study (266 in HSK3486 0.4/0.2 mg/kg group and 
133 in propofol 2.0/1.0 mg/kg group).  
Enrolled subjects will be stratified between the 2 treatment groups by [CONTACT_41536]-PS grade I to II and 
III to IV; age <65 and ≥65 years; and BMI <35 and ≥35 kg/m
2. The stratification schema will be 
described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
8.2. Analysis Populations  
Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized subjects who have received any dose of the study drug 
(HSK3486 or propofol).  
Per Protocol Set (PPS) : All subjects from FAS who have completed primary efficacy endpoint 
measurement will be considered for PPS. Subjects with any important protocol deviations will be 
reviewed after database lock and prior to study unblinding and may be excluded from PPS if 
these important deviations will impact the efficacy evaluations.

statistical analyses will be given in a separated Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
8.4. Efficacy Analysis 
8.4.1. Primary Efficacy Outcome Measure  
The statistical null hypothesis to be tested is: 
𝐻𝐻0: 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡−𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐≤ 𝛿𝛿 
With the alternative hypothesis: 
𝐻𝐻1: 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡−𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐>𝛿𝛿 
Where p t and p c are the anesthesia success rates for the HSK3486 and propofol arms, 
respectively, and δ is the NIM. This hypothesis will be tested at the 1 -sided α=0.025 level.  
Success rate of general anesthesia induction in both groups and rate difference between groups and its 95% confidence interval (CI) are estimated by [CONTACT_103209]-Manning method in the FAS. 
The stratification factors will be included in the analysis. The lower limit of 95% CI of rate 
difference will be compared with the NIM of -8% to confirm the establishment of non-
inferiority. The FAS subjects who are non- evaluable for anesthesia success will be counted as 
treatment failures.  
8.4.2. Justification of the Non -inferiority Margin  
The NIM for this study is based on the expectation that the active control, propofol, and HSK3486 will both perform similarly to historical evidence, achieving ≥97% efficacy for induction of general anesthesia, defined as achieving MOAA/S ≤1 after 1 dose, with no more than 1 top- up dose if needed. Since the expected response rates are ≥97%, there is little concern 
for loss of assay sensitivity (i.e., loss of efficacy) from historical performance or loss of the “constancy assumption.” Furthermore, the exercise of attempting to identify the M1 based on historical literature would lead to an unacceptably large margin, then applying clinical judgement to establish the M2 (often 50% of the M1) (Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Guidance for

>10%, which permits too much uncertainty to be acceptable or useful. Using a NIM of 8% is 
clinically relevant and meaningful for this indication. 
8.4.3. Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measures  
The proportion of subjects with successful induction, who maintain desired depth of anesthesia 
for general elective surgery, and without signi ficant cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_748583] [ADDRESS_1023699] initiation of study drug administration (prior 
to administration of rocuronium bromide) in both groups and difference between groups and 95% CI will be c alculated. The p -value for comparison between groups will be obtained based 
on the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel Chi -squared test using the stratification factors in the study 
randomization. 
The proportion of the subjects with any injection- site pain (NRS ≥1) and moderate pain (NRS 
≥4) will be analyzed, as well as the mean NRS pain score for each treatment group. 
The median and its 95% CI of time to successful induction of general anesthesia and time to the 
disappearance of eyelash reflex will be provided by [CONTACT_748595]- Meier (KM) 
method. The KM estimates and 95% CIs at selected time points will also be reported.  
The proportion of subjects with successful induction without non- optimal anesthetic effects 
within [ADDRESS_1023700]. If the null hypothesis fails to be rejected, the testing stops. If the primary endpoint is statistically significant, then the key secondary endpoints will be tested in parallel using a weighted Bonferroni- Holm step -down approach with weights w
1=0.7 for the 
proportion of subjects who maintain the desired depth of anesthesia, and w 2=0.3 for the i ncidence 
of injection -site pain. In this procedure, the p-values for the secondary endpoints are divided by 
[CONTACT_748622], then the endpoint for which this calculation is smaller (i.e., test p j < 
αj for j=arg min (p 1/0.035, p 2/0.015)) is tested. If the first test is rejected, then the other endpoint

Page 81 of 110 Appendix 2 Bispectral Index (BIS)  
The BIS Index is a number between 0 and 100 scaled to correlate with important clinical 
endpoints and electroencephalogram (EEG) states during administration of anesthetic agents 
(Figure 2 ). The BIS values near 100 represent an “awake” clinical state while 0 denotes the 
maximal electroencephalogram (EEG) effect possible (i.e., an isoelectric EEG).  
Figure 2  The BIS Index is scaled to correlate with important clinical endpoints during 
administration of anesthetic agent. 
 
It should be noted that the BIS Index range represents a continuum that correlates to the clinical state and expected responses ( Figure 3).  
This chart below reflects a general association between clinical state and BIS values. Ranges are based on results from a multicenter study of the BIS involving the administration of speci fic 
anesthetic agents. The BIS values and ranges assume that the EEG is free of artifacts that can affect its performance. Titration of anesthetics to BIS ranges should be dependent upon the individual goals established for each subject. These goals and as sociated BIS ranges may vary 
over time and in the context of subject status and treatment plan.

Page 86 of 110 Appendix 6  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Grade 
Before anesthesia, the ASA classifies subjects into 5 grades according to their physical 
conditions and the risk of surgery:  
 ASA I : Normal and healthy. No systemic diseases other than local lesions. 
 ASA II : A subject with mild systemic disease.  
 ASA III: A  subject with severe systemic disease that results in functional limitations but not 
incapacity.  
 ASA IV : A subject with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life and results in 
incapacity.  
 ASA V : A moribund subject who is not expected to survive without the operation. If it is an 
emergency surgery, mark "Emergency" or "E" before the evaluated level shown above.  
Subjects assessed as ASA I or ASA II have good tolerability to anesthesia and surgery, and the 
process of anesthesia is smooth. Subjects assessed as ASA Ⅲ are under certain risks of anesthesia. The pre-anesthetic preparation should be adequate. Effective measures should be 
taken to prevent complications that may occur during anesthesia. Subjects assessed as ASA IV 
are under parti cularly high risks of anesthesia. Subjects assessed as ASA V are under extremely 
high risks of anesthesia and surgery for their extremely critical conditions, extremely poor tolerability to anesthesia, and death that may occur at any time. Thus, pre- anesthetic preparation 
is more important and shall be adequate, careful, and comprehensive.

Page 90 of 110 Appendix 9 Adverse Event Definitions  
Definitions  
An adverse event (AE) is:  
 Any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject, regardless of whether or not 
considered drug- related.  The examples are as follows:  
 Any clinically significant recurrence or worsening of a pre-existing condition. 
 An AE occurring from overdose of a Sponsor study drug whether accidental or intentional (i.e., a dose higher than that prescribed by a healthcare professional for clinical reasons).  
 A treatment -emergent AE is defined  as: an AE that occurs  after the subject starts treatment 
with the IMP.  
A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition (including a condition being treated) that is 
diagnosed before the subject signs the Informed Consent Form and that is documented as part of the subject’s medical history. 
Note: A procedure is not an AE, but the reason for a procedure may be an AE. 
The diagnosis should be recorded, in preference to listing the individual signs and symptoms. For 
example, symptoms of fever, cough, and elevated white blood cells should be reported as pneumonia rather than the individual signs and symptoms. Abnormal laboratory values are typi[INVESTIGATOR_748587], but rather are included with the underlying 
diagnosis. For example, a low serum hemoglobin value associated with gastrointestinal bleeding 
should not be reported separately from the underlying diagnosis of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. 
Reporting of Adverse Events  
At each visit, the investigator, or delegate, will determine whether or not any AEs have occurred. 
Non-leading questions such as “How are you feeling today?” or “Have you had any health 
concerns since your last visit?” should be used to elicit the subject to report any possible AEs. If 
any AEs have occurred, they will be recorded in the AE section of the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and in the subject’s source documents.  
AEs will be collected from the time of informed consent until the final study visit.  AEs that are 
related to the investigational drug and continue beyond the normal collection period (i.e., are 
ongoing at the time a subject exits the study) will be followed until resolution or stabilization . 
Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will be asked to provide an assessment of the AE severity using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 classification. This study will

Page 91 of 110 enroll subjects undergoing elective surgeries requiring general anesthesia using endotracheal 
intubation; however, not all subjects will be healthy volunteers. Elective surgery does not 
necessarily mean optional surgery. Elective means the surgery can be scheduled in advance, and it can still be associated with serious conditions. The intent is to exclude emergent surgeries for life-threatening conditions, while still including a diverse, heterogenous patient population such 
as ASA -PS III- IV, elderly, and morbidly obese subjects with comorbidities. The CTCAE 
Version 5 severity classification is as follows:  
 Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
 Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activity of daily living (preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money). 
 Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care 
activity of daily living (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden). 
 Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
 Grade 5:  Death related to AE.  
 
Relationship to Study Treatment  
The investigator will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the stu dy drug using 
a 4-category system according to the following guidelines: 
 Not related : When the AE is definitely caused by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, or the study 
procedure/conditions. There is no association between the study drug and the reported event ; 
there is a clear alternative explanation; a causal relationship is non plausible.  
 Unlikely Related : Underlying or concurrent disease or other drugs/exposures provide 
plausible alternative explanations. Temporal relationship to study drug administration m akes 
a causal relationship improbable. 
 Likely Related : There is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE; the event is 
unlikely attributed to underlying or concurrent disease or other drugs/exposures (i.e., 
alternative explanation). There is a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study 
drug. 
 Definitely Related : A definite causal relationship exists between the drug administration and 
the AE; including a plausible time relationship to drug administration, and it cannot be explained by [CONTACT_305827]/exposures; abates upon

Action Taken for Adverse Events  
The investigator or designee will record the action taken for the AE in the eCRF. Actions taken 
will include: 
 Dose increased : The medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_60267], either by [CONTACT_748624], strength, or amount. 
 Dose not changed : The medi cation schedule was not changed.

Follow- up of Adverse Events  
All serious AEs (SAEs) that are ongoing at the time of discontinuation, or that develop prior to the final Follow -up Telephone Call, will be followed for 30 days, or until resolution or 
stabilization.  
Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that meets 1 or more of the following criteria:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening (see below) 
 Requires subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] (see below) 
 Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity (see below)  
 Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Results in an important medical event (see below).  
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one

caused death had it occurred in a more severe form but that did not create an immediate risk of 
death as it actually occurred. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening, even though drug-induced hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231323].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135625] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a criterion for considering an AE to be 
serious.  The following circumstances should not be considered an AE/SAE: 
 Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748588]. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112042] a routine procedure followed by 
[CONTACT_5243] (e.g., stent removal after surgery). This should be recorded in the study file. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748589] -up required as routine standard of care. 
In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112044] a pre- existin g condition that 
has not worsened does not constitute an SAE (e.g., elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a total knee 
replacement due to a pre-existing condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened during the study).   
Disability  is defined as a su bstantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions (i.e., the AE resulted in a significant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, 
damage, or disruption in the subject’s bodily function/structure, physical activities, or quality of life).   
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
those situations where important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability, or incapac ity. These include events that may jeopardize 
the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the 
definition of serious. Such events should usually be considered as serious.

for participation .   
Subjects or their legally authorized representative will be required to sign a statement of 
informed consent that meets the requirements of local regulations, ICH guidelines, and the IRB/EC or study center, where applicable. The subject will be given a copy of the signed ICF, 
and the original will be maintained with the subject’s records.  
Subjects must be re-consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participation 
in the study. 
Subject Data Protection  
Subjects will be assigned a u nique identifier and will not be identified by [CONTACT_178700] (eCRFs), study-related forms, study reports, or any related publications. 
Subject and investigator personal data will be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In the event the study protocol, study report, or study data are included in a public 
registry, all identifiable information from individual subjects or investigators will be redacted 
according to applicable laws and regulations.  
The subject must be informed that his/her personal study- related data will be used by [CONTACT_19490]. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the subject. The subject must also be informed that his/her medical records may be 
examined by [CONTACT_42505] (CRO) auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor, by [CONTACT_6667]/EC members, and by [CONTACT_91061]. 
Disclosure 
All information provided regarding the study, as well as all information collected and/or 
documented during the course of the study, will be regarded as confidential. The investigator (or designee) agrees not to disclose such information in any way without prior written permission from th e Sponsor. 
Data Quality Assurance 
The following data quality steps will be implemented: 
 All subject data relating to the study will be recorded on eCRFs unless directly transmitted to 
the Sponsor or designee electronically (e.g., laboratory data). The investigator is responsible 
for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by [CONTACT_42507].

 The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including 
quality checking of the data. Pre-defined, agreed risks, monitoring thresholds, quality 
tolerance thresholds, controls, and mitigation plans will be documented in a risk 
management register. Additional details of quality checking to be performed on the data may be included in a Data Management Plan.  
 Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered 
into the eCRF by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of subjects are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
 Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must 
be retained by [CONTACT_748627] 21 CFR 312.62(c) unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the Sponsor. No records may be 
transferred to another location or party without written notification to the Sponsor.  
Investigator Documentation Responsibilities 
All individual, subject-specific study data will be entered into a 21 CFR Part 11- compliant 
electro nic data capture (EDC) system on an eCRF in a timely fashion. All data generated from 
external sources (e.g., central laboratory, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, 
electrocardiogram central readers) and transmitted to the Sponsor or designee electronical ly will 
be integrated with the subject’s eCRF data in accordance with the Data Management Plan.  
An eCRF must be completed for each subject who signs an ICF and undergoes any pre- screening 
or screening procedures, according to the eCRF completion instructions. The Sponsor, or CRO, will review the supporting source documentation against the data entered into the eCRFs to 
verify the accuracy of the electronic data. The investigator will ensure that corrections are made to the eCRFs and that data queries are resolved in a timely fashion by [CONTACT_5984].   
The investigator will sign and date the eCRF via the EDC system’s electronic signature 
[CONTACT_42540]. These signatures will indicate that the investigator reviewed and approved the data on 
the eCRF, the data queries, and the site notifications.

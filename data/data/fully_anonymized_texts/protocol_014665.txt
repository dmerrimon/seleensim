Title:  
A Randomized Controlled Trial of Post-operative Acetaminophen versus Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory 
Drug Use on Lumbar Spi[INVESTIGATOR_516356]#:

Brief Summary:  
Patients undergoing spi[INVESTIGATOR_516358]-operatively and frequently require 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536] (Percocet, Norco, oxycodone, morphine, etc.) to control their pain postoperatively. 
The widespread use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], however, is associated with a number of side effects. These include: 
sedation, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness and itching amongst others. Some 
investigators have suggested that anti-inflammatory medications (the same class of medicines as advil, 
ibuprofen, etc.) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) can reduce the total dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_516359], as a result, lower opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related side effects. 
 
The purpose of this study is to test this hypothesis and determine if postoperative anti-inflammatory 
medications and postoperative acetaminophen can reduce the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_516360]. A secondary goal of this study is to examine if the change in pain medication will 
lead to decreased overall pain levels, decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related side effects and improved function 
[quicker ambulation with physical therapy (PT), earlier return to work, etc.]. 
 
  
Detailed Description:  
Given the potential for non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen to decrease 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_516361], the investigators propose a prospective, randomized, 
double-blinded clinical trial comparing the efficacy of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen (Group A) or IV 
ketorolac (Group K) versus placebo (Group P). The impact of treatment on perioperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related complications, functional outcomes and rates of pseudarthrosis following 1 or 2 level 
lumbar fusion surgery will be measured in each group. The specific aims of this study are as follows: 
 
Specific Aim 1: Determine the impact of IV ketorolac or IV acetaminophen use on immediate 
postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965], postoperative pain levels and opi[INVESTIGATOR_516362]-Related Symptom Distress Scale (ORSDS) 
Specific Aim 2: Determine the impact of IV ketorolac or IV acetaminophen use on functional outcomes 
defined by [CONTACT_516368], Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the Veterans Rand-12 (VR-12) Health 
Survey 
The primary outcome is to determine the total postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533] (in oral morphine equivalents) 
in each group. The investigators hypothesize that patients in Group A and Group K will have lower total 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], suffer from fewer opi[INVESTIGATOR_516363] P. The investigators hypothesize that patients in Group A and Group K will have a 
quicker return to work and improved early functional outcomes although they acknowledge that long 
term functional outcomes may be the same for all groups. 
 
This is a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.

Statistical plan: 
 
All normally distributed variables are described using mean and standard deviation (SD) for normally 
distributed continuous variables, median and interquartile range (IQR) for non-normally distributed 
continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical data. Normal distribution was assessed 
using a q-q plot prior to statistical analysis. Groups were compared using an analysis of variation 
(ANOVA) for normally distributed variables and a Kruskal-Wallis test for non-normally distributed 
variables; a chi-squared test was used for categorically distributed variables. Post-hoc pairwise 
comparisons (adjusted and unadjusted) were also performed.  
Assessment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_516367]-certified radiologists, 
J.L.C. with certificate of added qualification in Neuroradiology and [ADDRESS_669282]-fellowship 
experience.  Interbody and posterolateral fusion was assessed on a 4-point scale, 0 = no fusion; 1 = 
probably not fused; 2 = probably fused; 3 = definitely fused. Fusion assessment was performed on 
multiplanar CT imaging when available or dedicated lumbosacral radiographs with a minimum of 
anteroposterior and lateral views.

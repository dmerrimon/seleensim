discretion, a dditional bolus injections of rIX -FP may be administered 
during surgery or during the postoperative period, defined as the start 
of wound closure, to maintain a required trough FIX activity level.  
Subcutaneous (SC) Substudy  
Subjects enrolled in this substudy will be sequentially assigned to a 
cohort (Cohort 1 [ single dose of 25 IU/kg], Cohort 2 [single dose of 50 
IU/kg], Cohort 3 [ 15 doses of 25 IU/kg every 3  days], and an optional 
Cohort 4 [ 15 doses of ≤ 50 IU/kg every 5 days , with the actual dose in 
this cohort to be determined by [CONTACT_254817] 3).  In all cohorts, rIX-FP will be administered SC at least 
14 days after the previous intravenous ( IV) rIX-FP administration .  
In Cohorts 1 and 2, b lood samples for PK analysis will be collected at 
selected time  points through Day 15 (336 hours).  Following collection 
of the last SC PK sample at the 336 hour time point on Day 15 , a single 
IV dose of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP will be administered  and blood samples for 
PK analysis will be collected at selected time  points. Subjects will return

discontinued from receiving the study product and participating in any 
further study procedures if the subject is confirmed  to have developed 
an inhibitor against FIX with a titer > 5 Bethesda units (BU)/mL. 
The trough FIX activity level will be assessed after each major bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (if feasible) and at specified visits . 
See Appendix 2  for PK as sessments in the SC substudy. 
Pharmacodynamics  Not applicable.  
Other Assessments  Other assessments to be made during the study include:  
 A hemophilia -specific treatment satisfaction 
questionnaire  (Hemo-Sat; CSL654_3002 lead -in study only). 
  
 Social and physical activity  assessment.  
Statistical Analyses  All safety and efficacy data will be summarized  using descriptive 
statistics for continuous data, or frequencies and percentages  for 
categorical data .  
Efficacy Analyses  
AsBRs and ABRs will be derived for each treatment interval  assigned 
to the subject  while on routine prophylaxis  (7-day, 10-day, 14-day, and 
21-day), and will not include t he time either during or the first [ADDRESS_309573] two -sided 95% confidence interval assuming  a 
Poisson-distributed event rate . 
A comparison of A sBRs and ABRs  will be performed between 14 -day 
routine prophylaxis treatment in this study compared with on -demand 
only treatment from Study CSL654_3001  Arm 2.  A further analysis 
will be conducted with the  subjects from lead-in Study CSL654_3001 
to assess whether the 14-day prophylaxis regimen is non -inferior to the 
7-day prophylaxis regimen from Study CSL654_3001 (plus data

AsBR and ABR . The non-inferority analysis will also be conducted for 
extended regimens (either 14 -day or 10 -day regimen) and the 7-day 
prophylaxis regimen.   Non-inferiority will be evaluated by [CONTACT_254819] a 95% confidence  interval for a mean difference   
with a pre -established margin.   
Consumption of rIX -FP will be summarized with descriptive statistics 
according to treatment interval  and overall.   
For subjects fro m Study CSL654_3002, responses to the treatment 
satisfaction questionnaire and age group -specific  questionnaire 
(Hemo-Sat and , respectively ) will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics.  
Data from the surgery substudy will be summarized as case narratives  
or with descriptive statistics or counts , where appropriate . 
Safety Analyses  
The number and proportion of subjects with positive tests for inhibitors 
to FIX during the study will be tabulated  separately for PTPs (Arm 1, 2 
and 3) and PUPs (Arm 4).  Inhibitor antibodies against FIX will be 
categorized as low titer (≥ 0.6 to 5 BU/mL) and high titer (>  5 BU/mL).  
An exact 95% binomial confidence interval for inhibitor development 
among subjects treated with rIX -FP will be presented.  
The numbe r and proportion of subjects with adverse events and serious 
adverse events , which are study -emergent, will be tabulated.  
Laboratory, vital signs and physical examination assessments will be 
summarized.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Incremental recovery and FI X activity levels will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.

1.1BACKGROUND  
Hemophilia B is an X -linked recessive inherited bleeding disorder resulting from a deficiency 
of coagulation factor IX (FIX), a coagulation factor central to the process of blood 
coagulation  [Giangrande, 2005 ].  Signs and symptoms of  hemophilia  B are variable, depending 
on the severity of FIX deficiency and the location of bleeding .  Most often, bleeding is 
characterized by [CONTACT_254823] -induced hemorrhage  into joints, muscles, and soft 
tissues.  Recurrent bleeding in the same location may lead to permanent injury of the joint .  
Rare but life -threatening bleeding may also occur in the central nervous system, throat , or 
gastrointestinal tract.  
The goal of therapy for hemophilia B is to treat or prevent hemorrhage, thereby [CONTACT_254824], and improving .  Replacement therapy 
with FIX provides a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and reduces  bleeding 
tendencies .  Currently, plasma -derived and recombinant FIX products are used for the 
prophylactic and on -demand treatment of hemophilia B .  However, plasma -derived products 
are associated with risks related to transmission of infectious viruses  such as human 
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus , and hepatitis C virus .  Both plasma -derived and 
recombinant FIX products have a short half -life and, therefore, require dosing 2 to  3 times a 
week in order to achieve a significant reduction of bleedi ng epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] .  In addition, repeat dosing 
may be required to control bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_49576] a relatively short bleeding -free period 
following administration .  The need for frequent intravenous (IV) injections of either  plasma-
derived or recombinant F IX products carries significant burden for patients and the physicians 
treating their disorder .  Such a regimen in younger children often (but not always), requires the 
insertion of a venous access device that must be kept extremely clean to avoid infectious 
complications and prevent the development of clots in the line .  The risk and morbidity 
associated with such devices may prevent some very young children with hemophilia from 
receiving adequate care.

1.2BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON ON RECOMBINANT FUSION P ROTEIN 
LINKING COAGULATION FACTOR IX WITH ALBUM IN (rIX-FP) 
1.2.1 Overview 
Recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with albumin (rIX -FP) is a purified 
recombinant protein, generated by [CONTACT_254825] 
c-terminus of r ecombinant F IX, with a cleavable linker .  The protein comprises [ADDRESS_309608] as an adjuvant for the immune system.
rIX-FP is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells , which have been characterized and 
shown to be free of known infectious agents .  rIX-FP is not derived from human blood and 
contains no preservatives or added animal or human components .  In addition, 3 (2 dedicated)  
virus inactivation  / reduction steps are applied in the manufacturing  process (see the 
Investigator’s Brochure  for further details) . 
This phase 3b study of rIX-FP is intended to evaluate long-term data on the safety and efficacy 
of rIX-FP for routine prophylaxi s and on-demand treatment of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_254755] B (ie, FIX activity of ≤  2%). 
1.2.[ADDRESS_309609] demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, favorable 
pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and hemostatic efficacy.  
Single and repeat dose nonclinical rIX -FP safety studies have been conducted in rats  and 
cynomolgus monkeys .  In both species, the IV administration of rIX -FP, either as a single 
Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
Amendment [ADDRESS_309610]-077 Confidential  injection (500 IU/kg) or as a daily injection (up to 500 IU/kg/day) over 28 consecutive days, 
was well tolerated with no toxicologically  significant  changes [rats: studies APQ0005 , 
8244656, and APQ0009 and cynomolgus monkeys: studies APQ0002  and APQ0001 ].  In both 
species, the no observed adverse effect level for repeat doses of rIX -FP was 500 IU/kg  [studies 
APQ0009  and APQ0001 ], representing at least a [ADDRESS_309611] clinical dose of rIX -FP.  Repeat dosing was associated with the development of 
antihuman FIX antibodies (rats and cynomolgus monkeys) and an tihuman albumin antibodies 
(rats and 1 cynomolgus monkey) .   
Studies investigating local tolerance [Study APQ0008] and the thrombogenic 
potential [Study S22456] of rIX-FP have been conducted in rabbits .  There was n o local 
irritation, or treatment -related macroscopic or microscopic pathology findings, irrespective of 
the route of administration of rIX -FP (ie, IV, intra-arterial and perivenous injection) .  In 
addition, there was no thrombogenic activity observed in a rabbit venous stasis model (Wessler 
test) at any of the rIX -FP doses tested (75, 150 , and 500 IU/kg).   
Nonclinical studies have shown that rIX -FP has favorable PK properties, which might allow 
the reductio n of dosing frequency in patients with h emophilia B .   In a PK study in cynomolgus 
monkeys, rIX -FP was administered  as a single  IV injection  at doses of 50 or 100 IU/kg body 
weight [Study APQ0002 ].  The PK properties of rIX-FP were linear (ie, dose independent) 
over the dose range tested and were independent of sex .  The mean terminal half -life (t1/2) was 
42.[ADDRESS_309612] (t 1/2 = ~12.7 h) [McCarthy et al., 2002].   Studies in rats, rabbits, and FIX-deficient 
mice have also demonstrated that rIX -FP has improved PK parameters (ie, increased recovery, 
terminal half -life and area under the concentration -time curve [AUC] ) compared with  
published results of  a currently marketed recombinant FIX product [Metzner at al ., 2009].   
The pharmacodynamic activity of rIX -FP has been studied in 2 animal models deficient in FIX 
(dogs and mic e).  In the dog model, administration of rIX -FP (100 IU/kg IV) was associated 
Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
Amendment [ADDRESS_309613]-077 Confidential  with a shortening of the activated partial thromboplastin time and whole blood clotting time  
[Study 040200011 ].  In FIX deficient mice, the IV administration of rIX-FP (50, 100 , and 200 
IU/kg) was associated with a significant dose -dependent reduction of total blood loss, time to 
hemostasis and activated partial thromboplastin time  compared with the control (isotonic 
saline) [Study NBM 04/09 ].   
Further details on the outcomes of nonclinical studies are available in the 
Investigator’s  Brochure for rIX-FP. 
1.2.3 Previous Clinical Experience  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study CSL654 _2001: phase 1, open -label, multicenter, dose -escalation, sa fety and 
pharmacokinetic study  
The primary study objective of Study CSL654_2001 was to assess the safety of the IV 
administration of rIX -FP in previously treated subjects with hemophilia B  
[Study CSL654_2001 ].  Subjects (age: 15 to 58 years) were administered a single injection of 
rIX-FP at a dose of either 25  IU/kg (9 subjects), 50 IU/kg (14 subjects), or 75 IU/kg 
(9 subjects).  rIX-FP was well tolerated for the duration of the study .  Of the 25 unique study 
subjects, 3 subjects reported a total of 4 adverse events (AEs) that were possibly related to rIX -
FP treatment .  Two of these AEs ([ADDRESS_309614]: a mild headache and feeling hot 50 minutes after 
injection) resolved in 5 to 10 minutes without treatment .  The other 2 AEs ([ADDRESS_309615]: mild 
constipation; [ADDRESS_309616]: erythema at injection site), resolved within the same day without 
treatment .  None of the subjects, including [ADDRESS_309617] injection 
of rIX-FP.   
The study also investigated the PK profile of rIX -FP in 22 subjects .  At an rIX-FP dose of 
50 IU/kg (n = 13), the mean baseline -adjusted incremental recovery  (IR) (0 to 30 minutes)  was 
higher for rIX-FP compared with  both recombinant FIX  (46% higher; n = 8) and 
plasma-derived FIX (25% higher; n = 4) .  rIX-FP also exhibited an approximately 5 -fold longer  
Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
Amendment [ADDRESS_309618]-077 Confidential  mean baseline-corrected half-life (mean ± standard deviation [ SD]: 91.57 ± 20.74 hours), 7-
fold larger mean baseline -adjusted AUC and 7-fold slower clearance  when compared with the 
subject’s previous FIX product .  In addition, rIX -FP maintained a baseline -corrected mean 
trough level of 7.4% and 2.5% at Day 7 and Day  14, respectively, after administration of  
25 IU/kg rIX -FP. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study CSL654 -2004: phase 1/2, open -label, multicenter, pharmacokinetic, safety 
and efficacy study  
Study CSL654_2004 evaluated the safety, PK, and efficacy of rIX -FP for both prophylaxis and 
on-demand treatment of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_254756] B .  A total of 17  male 
subjects were enrolled from hemophilia treatment centers in Israel and Bulgaria; the mean age 
was 26 years (range 13 to 46 years) .  The study design consisted of a n initial 10 to 14-day PK 
evaluation period, followed by [CONTACT_149713] 11-month safety and efficacy evaluation 
period of both prophylaxis and on -demand treatment of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_254748] -FP.  
Subjects could remain on study and receive rIX -FP treatment until th eir enrollment in the 
CSL654_3001 study . 
A total of 14/17 (82.4%) subjects reported 46 treatment -emergent AEs, none of which were 
considered related to rIX -FP by [CONTACT_093] .  All AEs were mild or moderate in severity .  
There were no serious adverse e vents (SAEs) reported, and there were no withdrawals due to 
AEs.  No inhibitors to FIX were reported , and there were no clinically significant changes in 
serum biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis , or vital signs .  Before dosing with rIX -FP, 
[ADDRESS_309619] tested negative for all antibodies tested (rIX -FP, plasma -derived FIX and 
BeneFIX®).   
All subjects receiving prophylaxis therapy were placed on a weekly (ie, 7-day treatment 
interval) rIX-FP treatment regimen throughout the study .  For each subject, the dose of rIX -FP 
was initially determined based upon the PK profile of rIX -FP and the subject’s  bleeding 
phenotype, but could be adjusted at the investigator’s discretion .   The mean FIX consumption  
Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
Amendment [ADDRESS_309620]-077 Confidential  was reduced  compared with the previous FIX therapy; the mean weekly dose  of rIX-FP was 
58.6 ± 10.7 IU/kg during the last [ADDRESS_309621] of 87.7  ± 45.8 IU/kg. 
In the prophylaxis treatment group, 8/13 (61.5%) subjects reported a total of 47 bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_254757] -FP.  In the on-demand treatment group (n = 4), all 
subjects (ie, 4 subjects) reported a total of 38  bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] s that required treatment .  All 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_254758] (n = 85) were successfully treated with 1 or 2 doses of 
rIX-FP.  The mean ABR was lower for both spontaneous  and total bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_254759]  (mean ± SD: spontaneous  ABR = 1.3  ± 1.5; total ABR = 4.4 ± 4.7; n = 13) 
compared with the on -demand treatment group (mean ± SD: spontaneous  ABR = 21.7 ± 4.0; 
total ABR = 26.8 ± 2.7; n = 4).  The annuali zed rate of  traumatic bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_254760] -demand treatment groups .  In both treatment groups, t here were no 
major bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_254761] d oses of rIX -FP required .   
The PK of rIX -FP were evaluated  in 13 subjects receiving either prophylactic or on -demand 
therapy.  After a single IV injection of 25 IU/kg rIX -FP, the mean FIX activity level was 3.75% 
and 2.67% above baseline at Day 7 and Day 14, respectively, and the mean half -life of rIX -FP 
was 95 hours.

Study CSL654_3001, which will enrol l approximately 60 subjects (age: 12 to 65 years), will 
consist of an initial 10- to 14-day PK evaluation period .  After this period, subjects will receive 
either prophylaxis therapy or on -demand treatment with rIX -FP: 
Subjects in Arm 1 (approximately 35 subjects) will receive prophylaxis therapy for a
period of approximately 1 3 months.   Initially, subjects will administer rIX -FP (initial

Amendment [ADDRESS_309622]-077 Confidential  dose: 25 to 50 IU/kg) with a treatment interval  of [ADDRESS_309623] to target a trough FIX activity of  > 1% between doses .   
Subjects in Arm 2 (approximately 21 subjects) will receive on -demand treatment with
rIX-FP for approximately 26 weeks and then switch to prophylaxis therapy for the
remainder of the study (approximately 30 weeks) .  During prophylaxis  therapy, subjects
will administer rIX -FP (initial dose: 35 to 50  IU/kg) with a treatment interval  of [ADDRESS_309624] to target a trough FIX activity
of > 1% between doses .
Study CSL654_3002, which will enro ll approximately 24 subjects (age: < 12 years), will 
consist of an initial 14 -day PK evaluation period, and an approximately 11 -month (50  exposure 
days [EDs]) treatment period, during which, subjects will receive prophylaxis therapy with 
rIX-FP (initial dos e: 35 to 50 IU/kg) administered with a treatment interval  of 7 days. 
Both studies (CSL654_3001 and CSL654_3002) will also evaluate the hemostatic efficacy of 
rIX-FP for surgical prophylaxis .   
Study CSL654_3001 began enrolling subjects in February [ADDRESS_309625] not previously completed a CSL -
sponsored rIX-FP lead-in study. Previously untreated patients (PUPs) , who have never been

subjects from the lead -in studies CSL654_3001 or CSL654_3002 are expected to have  
accumulated at least 100  rIX-FP EDs during enro llment in all CSL -sponsored rIX -FP studies .  
During the study, subjects may also participate in the surgical prophylaxis substudy  (see 
Appendix 1 ) or in the subcutaneous (SC) substudy (see Appendix 2 ).   
This extension study cons ists of a prophylaxis treatment period (up to approximately  5 years 
for Arms 1 , 2 and 3; up to approximately 3 years for Arm 4)  during which subjects will 
administer rIX -FP as routine prophylaxis .  During an initial [ADDRESS_309627] ered using the following treatment 
intervals: 
Arm 1: Once every 7, 10, or 14 days  (subjects who have completed  studies
CSL654_3001 Arm 1  or CSL654_3002 , or any other CSL -sponsored rIX -FP [CSL654]
lead-in study).
Arm 2: Once every 7 days (subjects from Study CSL654_3001 Arm 2 with less than  26
weeks of experience with weekly prophylaxis ) or once every 14 days (subjects from
Study CSL654_3001 Arm [ADDRESS_309628] 26 -weeks experience with weekly
prophylaxis) .
Arm 3: Once every 7 days (subjects who have not previously completed a CSL -
sponsored rIX -FP [CSL654] lead-in study).  No subjects in [LOCATION_009] may enroll in Arm  3.

undergo additional rIX -FP PK evaluations at the investigator’s discretion or CSL’s request.  
Subjects in Arm 3 who require major non -emergency surgery will undergo a n initial PK 
evaluation (100 IU/kg  rIX-FP) to determine the incremental recovery and FIX activity.  These 
subjects will then complete the surgery substudy (see Appendix 1 ) after which they may start 
the prophylaxis treatment period.  
If any subject from a lead -in study requires a major or minor surgical non -emergency procedure 
during the prophylaxis treatment period , the subject may be enrolled in the surgery substudy 
(see Appendix 1 ).   
Arm 4: During an initial [ADDRESS_309632] 12 months, subjects may also receive on -demand and / or prevention treatment only.   
Subjects in Arm 4 will undergo a n rIX-FP (50 IU/kg) PK evaluation at Day [ADDRESS_309633] may be enrolled in  the surgery substudy (see Appendix 1 ).

development of thromboembolic complications .  In addition, there is a risk of development of 
albumin and CHO cell -derived protein antibodies .  The potential risks associated with 
treatment with rIX -FP are discussed in detail in Section 7.4 of the Investigator’s Brochure . 
The results from the rIX -FP nonclinical program and the data from previous clinical studies, 
support the evaluation of an rIX-FP treatment interval  of between 7 and 14 days.  The safety 
and efficacy of rIX-FP (100 IU/kg) using a 21-day treatment interval  will also be e xamined in 
this study .  Given that nonclinical studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys have shown a no 
observed adverse effect level  of 500 IU/kg, there is not expected to be any additional safety 
concerns regarding the use of rIX -FP at a dose of 100 IU/kg .  There is a risk that administration 
of rIX-FP at a treatment interval  of 21 days might be less effective at preventin g bleeds than  
when administered at a treatment interval  of 14 days or less .  However, the PK evaluation of 
rIX-FP at a dose of 100 IU/kg will provide information on the trough  FIX activity  level using 
this dose of rIX -FP.  In addition, prophylaxis treatmen t using a 21 -day treatment interval  will 
only be available to subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_309635] 6 months of

This study will  document all key safety factors including immunogenicity, thrombogenicity, 
hypersensitivity, and other AEs in the intended therapeutic population . 
Thus, the associated benefit-risk assessment of the study is acceptable for subjects enrolled in

A tiered approach for immunogenicity testing for antibodies to rIX-FP will be employed during 
the study:  
1.Screening assay : The screening assay is a direct -binding ELISA assay, capable of
detecting antibodies against rIX -FP in blood samples from subjects.
2.Confirmation assays : If the antibody titer is above the cut -off level for the screening
assay, the same sample  will be tested in a separate direct -binding ELISA assay to
confirm the specific antibody signal and to discriminate between plasma -derived FIX,
rIX-FP, and albumin antibodies .  In the event that all confirmation assays are negative,
the screening assay will be considered a false positive result.
3.Neutralization assay for inhibitors : The neutralizing capacity of antibodies will be
assessed by a FIX potency assay .  To quantify anti -FIX neutralizing antibodies, the
Bethesda assay with the Nijmegen modification will be used, and the results expressed
as Bethesda Units per mL (BU/mL).
In cases where the inhibitor titer is determined to be above the cut -off level (0.6 BU/mL), a 
second blood sample should be collected and be tested by [CONTACT_254839], and additional testing such as PK  / incremental recovery tests will be performed .

 Is life-threatening  – The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe.  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  – 
CSL considers “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]” for at least

9.1.1]) are not considered as defining criteria for SAEs .   
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
 Is medically significant  – A medically significant event is d efined as an event that does

considered related to rIX-FP.   
The degree of certainty with which an AE is attributed to  rIX-FP or an alternative cause 
(eg, natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy) will be determined by [CONTACT_254846]:  
 Known pharmacology of rIX-FP.

reported to CSL and included in the clinical database  (see Section 9.6). 
9.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
9.5.1 Adverse Events  
At each clinical evaluation, the investigator (or delegate) will determine whether any AEs have 
occurred.  AEs will be recorded in the AE page of the eCRF .  If known, the medical diagnosis 
of an AE should be recorded in preference to the listing of individual signs and symptoms .  The 
investigator must follow up on the course of an AE until resolution  or stabilization .  If an AE 
is ongoing after the end of study visit , the AE will continue to be followed up until resolution,

for Expedited Reporting).  
For SAEs occurring during the study, the investigator or delegate will enter all relevant 
information in the AE page of the eCRF.  An electronic document containing the AE page and 
other applicable pages of t he eCRF must be sent (via facsimile or email) to the sponsor together 
with a Notification of Serious Adverse Event at Investigator Site  cover page, which has 
been signed and dated by [CONTACT_737] .  If an electronic document is not able to be generated 
(eg, internet access problem), a handwritten paper SAE report must be completed, which must 
be signed and dated by [CONTACT_093] .   
All SAEs that occur during the course of the study, whether or not causally related to 
rIX-FP, must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the investigator becoming 
aware of the event) to CSL .  For Japan sites only, the investigator  must also inform the 
head of the medical institution  of the SAE and related information in accordance with the 
Japanese regulatory requirements and ICH GCP.  
Adverse events occurring in the period between  the times the subject gave written informed 
consent and the first exposure to rIX-FP that meet one or more of the seriousness criteria for 
AEs must be reported to CSL in the same manner as other SAEs and will be included in the 
clinical study database .   
Any SAE that occurs after the end of study visit that is considered  to be causally related to rIX-
FP must be reported immediately ( ie, within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware

The minimum reporting requirements for immediate reporting of SAEs include:  
 Identifiable subject.  
 Suspected medicinal product and  / or procedure.  
 Event term. 
 Identifiable reporting source.  
In addition, the investigator must: 
 Report all SAEs to the relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Independent Ethics 
Committee  (IEC) within the timeframe  specified by [CONTACT_1201] / IEC . 
 Submit follow -up reports to CSL Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance until the SAE 
has resolved, o r, in the case of permanent impairment, until stabilized.  
 Ensure that the causality assessment for all SAEs is entered in the eCRF.  
If the minimum requirements for reporting are fulfilled, the investigator should not wait to 
receive additional information to fully document the event before notifying CSL.   
When submitting SAE reports and any other related reports (eg, discharge summaries) to CSL, 
subjects should be identified only by [CONTACT_254849] .  The investigator 
should not includ e the subject’s name , date of birth, or  address. 
In cases of death, the investigator should supply CSL and the IRB / IEC (as applicable) with 
any additional information as it becomes available (eg, autopsy reports and detailed medical 
reports).

Efficacy summaries and analyses of surgical data will be performed on the surgical population.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
This study does not have a primary efficacy endpoint since the evaluation of efficacy is not a 
primary objective.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The AsBR  and ABR will be derived for each treatment interval assigned to the subject (7 days, 
10 days, 14 days, and 21 days), and will not include  the time either during or the first 3 months 
after the surgery substudy, the time during the SC substudy,  and subjects in Arm 4 .  Rates will

AsBR and ABR are considered secondary endpoints in this study .  Other types of bleed ing 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (eg, trauma tic) will be summarized in a similar manner as these secondary endpoints.  
A comparison of A sBR and ABR will be performed between 14 -day routine prophylactic 
treatment in this study compared with on -demand only treatment from Study CSL654_3001  
(Arm 2).  A Wilcoxon rank sum test will be performed on the matched -pairs at the two -sided 
0.[ADDRESS_309766] also exists for the 14 -day prophylaxis 
regimen and 7 -day prophylaxis regimen, the  mean AsBR will be compared between the 
2 prophylaxis regimens to evaluate non -inferiority. Following the same clinically acceptable 
difference  used in the CSL654_3001 study, a non -inferiority margin of 6 spontaneous 
bleeds/year has been selected.   
The null and alternative hypotheses for the AsBR are as follows:  
H0:  µ7-day – µ14-day  -6 
H1:  µ7-day – µ14-day > -6

lower confidence limit of the 95% confidence inte rval, based on a one -sample (paired) 
t-distribution, for the difference between the two means  (7-day regimen - 14-day regimen)  must 
be greater than -6 spontaneous bleeds/year .   
The same analysis will be conducted  for the comparison of ABR. The clinical difference of 
6 total bleeds/year is selected when switching from 7 -day prophylaxis regimen to 14 -day 
prophylaxis regimen. Futhermore, the non -inferority analysis of AsBR and ABR between the 
extended regimen s (14-day or 10-day) and the 7-day regimen will be conducted in a similar 
manner. 
Similar comparisons of ABR and AsBR between treatment regimens will also be conducted 
for the subgroup of pediatric subjects.  
Multiple comparisons and multiplicity:  A fixed-sequence multiple testing procedure will be 
used to control the overall Type I error rate at the two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_309768] be performed at the two -sided 0.05 level of significance. Only if the 14 -day regimen 
is found to be effective, will the 14 -day prophylaxis regimen be non -inferior to 7 -day

demonstrated non -inferior to the 7-day regimen, will the extended prophylaxis regimen (10 -day 
or 14-day) be non -inferior to the 7-day regimen . 
Consumption of rIX -FP will be summarized with descriptive statistics according to treatment

Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the substudy is to evaluate the efficacy of rIX -FP in the prevention 
and control of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia  B during surgical procedures.  
Primary Endpoint  
Investigator’s  (or surgeon’s) overall clinical assessment of hemostatic efficacy for surgical 
prophylaxis, based on a four point ordinal scale (excellent, good, moderate, poor  / none)    
Secondary Objective and Endpoints  
Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective of th e study is to evaluate the safety of rIX -FP during the 
intraoperative and postoperative periods.  
Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints of this surgery substudy are:  
 The frequency of AEs related to rIX -FP during the intraoperative and postoperative 
periods.   
 The occurrence of FIX inhibitors .   
 The occurrence of antibodies against rIX -FP.   
 Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
 
Amendment [ADDRESS_309802]-077 Confidential   Comparison of predicted and intraoperative estimated blood loss.  
 Comparison of predicted and actual transfusion requirements.  
 Change in hemoglobin levels between ba seline, intraoperatively and postoperatively.  
STUDY DESIGN 
This is a prospective, open -label substudy to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rIX -FP to 
prevent bleeding during surgery in patients with congenital FIX deficiency (hemophilia B) .  
The study wil l consist of intraoperative and postoperative safety and efficacy evaluation 
periods with rIX -FP.  Subjects must meet all of the inclusion criteria of the main study and 
require non-emergency  major or minor surgery .  A major surgery is defined as a surgical 
procedure that involves anesthesia (general, spi[INVESTIGATOR_28947] l, epi[INVESTIGATOR_254799]),  respi[INVESTIGATOR_72788] , or requires hemostatic therapy for periods exceeding 5  consecutive days  
(including but not limited to orthopedic and cardiac surgery) .   
Approximately [ADDRESS_309803] will receive 
a single bolus injection of rIX -FP in order to increase the plasma FIX activity level to either 
60% to 80%, or higher, as recommended by [CONTACT_254872] , or higher if 
recommended by [CONTACT_254873][INVESTIGATOR_307] / practice .  Additional bolus injections of 
rIX-FP may be administered  during a major surgery, if needed.  Blood samples for the 
determination of FIX levels will be collected before administratio n of additional doses of 
rIX-FP, if feasible .  During the postoperative period, defined as the start of wound closure, 
additional bolus injections of rIX -FP may be administered to maintain a required trough FIX 
activity level as recommended by [CONTACT_254874], at the investigator’s discretion.  
Details of the surgical procedure are to be documented as outlined in Perioperative Prophylaxis 
for Surgeries .  Efficacy and safety data during and after surgery will be recorded, including 
time / dose of rIX-FP with documentation of total consumption, investigator’s assessments of 
blood loss and overall efficacy, transfusion requirements and AEs.  
 Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
 
Amendment [ADDRESS_309804]-077 Confidential  Number of Subjects 
Any subjects requiring surgery during the course of the main study  (CSL654_3003)  will be 
enrolled in the surgery substudy, with a  combined  target enrollment of at least 5 subjects and 
10 major surgeries  across the lead -in studies and this study .   
Duration  
The substudy design includes a 1 to 14 day  (or longer, if needed)  active treatment period .  
Subjects will then return to the treatment plan of the main study  at Day 28  ± [ADDRESS_309805] meet all eligibility criteria of the main study 
protocol and:  
 Must require non -emergency surgery.  
 Must provide written informed consent for sub study participation . 
ALLOCATION , DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
Dose and Dosing Rationale  
There will be 3 treatment periods in this substudy: preoperative, intraoperati ve and 
postoperative .  The dose of rIX -FP will be selected based on the subject’s PK data obtained 
during the lead -in study or this (CSL654_3003) study, including incremental recovery and 
clearance , and the recommendations of the WFH. 
The desired FIX increase (% or IU/dL), as recommended by [CONTACT_254874] (see Appendix 3 ) for the 
control of bleeding during surgery should be calculated based on an individual subject’s PK 
data using the following formula:  
Number 
of factor 
IX IU 
required 
(IU) = Body 
weight 
(kg) X Desired 
factor IX 
increase 
(% or 
IU/dL) X Reciprocal of 
observed 
recovery 
(IU/kg per 
IU/dL) 
 Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
 
Amendment [ADDRESS_309806] will be 
administered  1 bolus injection of rIX -FP.  The dose of rIX -FP (50 to 100 IU/kg, or higher ) will 
be selected based on the sub ject’s individual PK parameters , in order to increase the FIX levels  
to 60% to 80% , or higher.   
Intraoperative treatment  
The subject may receive intraoperative doses of rIX -FP, depending on the FIX activity levels, 
type of surgery and local standard of care .  FIX activity levels should be measured before 
major surgery to ensure the trough FIX activity level is maintained at 60 % to 80% during 
major surgical procedures .  In the event of the need for repeat dosing during the surgery, the 
FIX activity level should be measured.  
Postoperative treatment  
The subject will receive p ostoperati ve injections of rIX -FP from 1 to 14 days  (or longer, if 
needed), depending on the FIX activity levels, type of surgery and as recommended by  [CONTACT_254875].  FIX activity levels should be measured before repeat dosing .  Removal of sutures or 
drains is best carried out at the time of peak FIX activity level. 
CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
All drugs currently being taken by a subject after the screening visit , and which continue to 
be taken during the substudy, are regarded as concomitant therapy and must be documen ted 
in the eCRF.  Nonpharmacological intervention (eg, physical therapy or a minor surgical 
procedure performed outside of the surgical substudy) is also regarded as concomitant 
therapy and must be documented in the eCRF.  
 
 Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
 
Amendment [ADDRESS_309807]-077 Confidential  The following concomitant therapy is PERMITTED during the study if needed:  
 Blood product transfusion (whole blood, erythrocytes [red blood cells], FFP or 
platelets), documented as planned blood product transfusion before the start of the 
surgery, if its use is planned . 
 Heparin use is limit ed to 200 U/day, if needed, to maintain patency of IV lines.

Amendment [ADDRESS_309814]-077 Confidential  B.  Minor Surgery  
Procedures to be performed before and after minor surgery are provided i n the Schedule of 
Assessments: Surgery Substudy – Minor Surgery .  If, during the surgery,  unforeseen 
circumstances result in the procedure fitting the definition of a major  surgical procedure (ie, 
requires anesthesia,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_254803] a perio d exceeding 
5 consecutive days ), the assessments detailed for major surgery  (Section A) should be 
completed.  
Before Surgery  
The following procedures will be performed BEFORE  administration of rIX -FP for surgical 
prophylaxis : 
 Eligibility asses sment. 
 Record type of surgery and association (if any) with hemophilia.   
 Body weight.  
 Obtain blood samples (optional) for measurement of plasma FIX activity level (central 
and / or local laboratory).  
 Review concomitant therapy.  
 Review AEs since last visit.  
 rIX-FP should be administered approximately 3 to 6 hours before surgery.   
 Blood sample s (optional)  for measurement of plasma FIX activity should be collected 
[ADDRESS_309815]’s incremental recovery rate 
will be used to calculate the dose of rIX -FP without testing the FIX activity level at the 
local laboratory . 
Before surgery, if feasible, the following estimates must be made by [CONTACT_254878]:  
 Estimate of intraoperative predic ted blood loss (PBL) (average and maximum).  
 Estimate planned hemostatic intervention (other than rIX -FP). 
 Estimate planned transfusion during surgery.  
 Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
 
Amendment [ADDRESS_309816]-077 Confidential   Estimate planned rIX -FP dose during surgery.  
 Estimates must be based  on a patient without hemophilia, undergoing the same surgical 
procedure.  
During Surgery  
The following information should be recorded : 
 Blood samples before injection of rIX -FP (if an additional dose is needed and sample 
collection is feasible ) for plasma F IX activity level ( central and local laboratory).  
 Dose of rIX -FP administered (if needed).  If the dose of rIX -FP is more than the planned 
dose, the reason for the discrepancy should be documented, including any unforeseen 
complications.  
 Additional hemostatic interventions and / or transfusions required during surgery 
(including blood products and other coagulation factor[s]).  In the event that the actual 
additional hemostatic interventions and / or transfusions required are higher than t he 
estimated planned hemostatic interventions (other than rIX -FP) and / or transfusions 
required, the possible reason(s) should be documented as:  
o Inadequate hemostasis.  
o Incorrect dose or dose regimen of rIX -FP. 
o Unexpected or unforeseen complication.  
o Other. 
Immediately After (0 hours) Surgery  
 Physical examination.  
 Vital signs.  
 Blood samples before injection of rIX -FP (if needed) for plasma FIX activity level 
(central and local laboratory).  
 Dose of rIX -FP (if needed).  
 Record AEs and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
 Using clinical judgment, the investigator (in consultation with the surgeon) will evaluate 
the intraoperative hemostasis of the subject after the end of the surgical procedure 
 Study Number:  CSL654_3003  
Study Product:  rIX-FP 
 
Amendment [ADDRESS_309817]-077 Confidential  according to the efficacy scale ( Investigator’s Evaluation of Efficacy of Surgical 
Treatment ).   
 Intraoperative estimated blood loss (EBL).  The EBL will be based on the 
anesthesiologist’s record of EBL during the surgical proc edure.  If an anesthesiologist 
was not present during the procedure, EBL will be estimated by [CONTACT_254879].  In the event that the actual intraoperative EBL is 
higher than the intraoperative PBL, the possible reason(s) should be documented as:  
o Inadequate hemostasis.  
o Incorrect dose or dose regimen of rIX -FP. 
o Blood loss expected as integral to the procedure.  
o Unexpected blood loss due to unforeseen complications.  
o Other. 
At Discharge  
At discharge , the following procedures should be performed:  
 Physical exam ination. 
 Vital signs.  
 Blood samples for FIX activity level ( central and local laboratory).  
 Dose of rIX -FP (if needed).  
 Record AEs and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 Quantification of postoperative bleeding.  
 Investigator evaluation  of overall efficacy. 
 Prophylaxis rIX -FP therapy should be restarted as soon after the surgical procedure as 
medically appropriate.   If a subject does not restart  prophylaxis, the subject should be 
withdrawn from the study and the rationale for the decisio n should be documented in the 
eCRF. In addition, a ttempts should be made to complete and document the end of study 
assessment s (main study).

Amendment [ADDRESS_309818]-077 Confidential  C.  End of Participation in the Substudy (Major and Minor Surgery)   
The end of substudy participation for an indivi dual subject occurs with the end of the 
postoperative period, which is defined as completion of the final s ubstudy visit and the 
resumption of the main study protocol .  Subjects in Arm 3 may end participation in the study 
at this visit or start routine pro phylaxis treatment in the main study.  
The following procedures will be performed at the final  substudy visit:  
 Physical examination.  
 Vital signs.  
 Blood samples for hematology  (major surgery only) . 
 Blood samples for antibodies against rIX -FP and FIX inhibitor (central lab oratory). 
 Blood sample for FIX activity level (central and local lab oratory). 
 Record AEs and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

 INTRODUCTION  
Background  
This substudy of CSL654_3003 will evaluate the safety and PK of single and repeated 
subcutaneous ( SC) administration of rIX-FP in adults with severe hemophilia B (ie, FIX 
activity of ≤  2%) who are currently enrolled in the main CSL654_3003 study . Safety will be 
measured by [CONTACT_254880], SAEs, investigator and subject assessments of local 
tolerability, and the incidence of inhibitors to rIX -FP. Pharmacokinetic endpoints will be 
measured based on FIX activity.  
Nonclinical Evaluation  
PK characteristics following SC administrati on of rIX-FP were assessed in h emophilia B 
mice, rabbits, pi[INVESTIGATOR_254805]. SC administration of rIX -FP in all species was 
systemically and locally well tolerated.  Respective bioavailabilities following S C 
administration were 31 % to 50% (hemophilia B mice), 43 % to 55% (rabbits), 22% (pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]) and 
9.29% to 17% (cynomolg us monkeys). Fu rthermore, exposure values in h emophilia B mice, 
rabbits, and cynomolgus monkeys were higher than those of marketed human FIX products 
(BeneFIX® or Berinin® P). 
A single SC dose in hemophilia  B mice provided a clear hemostatic effect compare d to the 
control group , with a significant reduction in time to hemostasis and total blood loss.  Efficacy 
of SC rIX-FP treatment was also superior to BeneFIX® administered SC. Additional activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) measurement at the end of the study demonstrated a 
significant reduction of aPTT values versus saline controls as well as BeneFIX® treated mice.    
Tolerability of SC injection was investigated in t he rabbit.  A single SC injection of rIX -FP 
was tolerated with no observed in -life findings, and minor local findings in histopathology, 
potentially being volume dose -dependent.

Amendment [ADDRESS_309849] FIX  (including 
neutralizing antibodies [inhibitors] ) and hypersensitivity reactions . The potential risks 
associated with treatme nt with rIX -FP and specifically with SC administration  are discussed 
in detail in Section 7.4 of the Investigator’s Brochure . 
The use of a FIX replacement product with an extended half -life could be significantly 
beneficial to those affected by [CONTACT_232247] B.  SC administration of rIX -FP may allow rout ine 
prophylaxis treatment for h emophilia B patients without the need for IV injections.  This 
route of administration may be beneficial particularly for those patients who have poor 
venous access, and may elimi nate the need for an indwelling catheter.  
The associated benefit-risk assessment of the substudy is acceptable for subjects enrolled in 
the substudy.

STUDY DESIGN  
Study Design and Rationale  
This is an open -label, multicenter  substudy to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK following 
single and repeated  ascending SC doses of rIX-FP in hemophilia B subjects.   Subjects will be 
treated in 1  or more of the 4 planned, sequential dose cohorts . Note: Cohort 4 is optional  and 
will only be opened if the results of Cohorts 1 to 3  reveal that additional data on repeated SC 
dosing is required to inform the further clinical development .  Each cohort will enroll a 
minimum of 4 and a maximum of 6 subjects.   
 Cohort 1:  single SC dose of 25 IU/kg rIX-FP. 
 Cohort 2:  single SC dose of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP.

Amendment [ADDRESS_309851]-077 Confidential  
  Cohort 3:  repeated SC doses of 25 IU/kg rIX-FP every 3 days  (15 doses). 
 Cohort 4:  repeated SC doses of ≤ 50 IU/kg rIX-FP every 5 days (15 doses); actual 
dose to be used in this cohort will be determined by [CONTACT_254881] 3. 
Male hemophilia B patients, ≥  [ADDRESS_309852] 100 EDs  (Cohorts 1 and 2) or 50 EDs (Cohort s 3 and 4) to rIX-FP and weigh ≥50 kg to 
≤ 100 kg will be eligible for the substudy.  
Up to 28 days prior to SC administration of rIX -FP, subjects will be screened to determine 
eligibility for the substudy.  Subjects will be sequentially assigned to a cohort  (Cohort 1, 2, 3 
or 4).  SC administration of rIX-FP will be performed  at least 14 days afte r the previous IV 
rIX-FP administration ([ADDRESS_309853] is on a 21 -day prophylaxis regimen).   Blood 
samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points detailed in the  Schedule of 
Assessments for Cohorts 1 and 2 ).   
In Cohorts [ADDRESS_309854] SC PK sample , a single IV dose of 
50 IU/kg rIX-FP will be administered .  If LL FIX activity is > 5 IU/dL at 336 h ours, up to 
3 additional PK blood samples may be taken every 48  hours (384, 432, and 480 hours) until 
LL is < 5 IU/dL, and the IV dose delayed until completion of the additional PK sampling at 
the discretion of the investigator .  Following IV administration of rIX -FP, blood samples for 
PK analysis will be collected at selected time  points (see Schedule of Assessme nts for 
Cohorts 1 and 2 ). Subjects will return in 2 weeks (Day 28) for an end of substudy visit to 
assess safety.  After the end of substudy visit on Day 28, subjects will return to their IV rIX -
FP regimen in the main study.   
After at least [ADDRESS_309855] reached Day 15, plasma exposure after SC 
administration (FIX activity levels) and safety , including inhibitor results,  will be reviewed 
by a Safety Review Committee  (SRC).  If no safety concerns are identified, dosing of Cohort 
2 may start.

the data, a decision will be made to enroll Cohort 3.   
In Cohorts 3 and 4, subjects will be sequentially assigned to SC doses of 25 IU/kg every 
3 days (Cohort 3)  or to SC doses of ≤ 50 IU/kg every 5 days (Cohort 4) , for a total of [ADDRESS_309857] 14 days afte r the previous IV 
rIX-FP administration  (21 days for subjects on a 21 -day IV regimen in the main study). 
Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected before the first SC dose , before selected 
SC doses administered at the study site , and for a serial PK profile after the first and the final 
SC doses. Doses 4 to 12 and Dose 14 will be administered by [CONTACT_1766]/caregivers at home.

indicated, at the discre tion of the investigator. 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of rIX-FP 
Cohorts 1 and 2: 
If during the PK assessment peri od, a subject experiences a ble eding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], no further 
blood samples will be taken as part of PK assessment, regardles s of whether the bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_254810].  The  PK may or may not need to be re peated.   
If LL FIX activity is ≤ 2 IU/dL , at any time point, subsequent time points may be omitted and 
the IV dose may be administered. 
 
 Study Number: CSL654_3003 
Study Product: rIX-FP 
 
Amendment [ADDRESS_309886]-077 Confidential 
 If LL FIX activity is > 5 IU/dL at 336 hours, up to 3 additiona l blood PK samples may be 
taken every 48 hours (384, 432, and 480 hours) until LL is < 5 IU/dL, and the IV dose 
delayed until completion of the a dditional PK sampling at the d iscretion of the investigator. 
Cohorts 3 and 4:  
If a subject experiences a bleed ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_254811], the subject 
should treat the bleeding epis ode with his standard on-demand I V dose of rIX-FP as 
prescribed in the main study. The  subject should continue in th e SC substudy following the 
same schedule of SC injections, regardless of the IV treatment of that bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. All 
PK sampling should be completed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments for the SC 
substudy. See section “Substudy Pharmacokinetic Population” for  details on the PK inclusion 
of these subjects. 
Overview of Variables 
The SC PK of rIX-FP and the subject’s previous FIX product will  be assessed on the basis of 
measurements of FIX activity levels in plasma.  PK samples will  be used to measure the 
following PK parameters: 
Cohorts 1 and 2:  
 Cmax 
 Incremental recovery (the pea k level recorded 30 minutes after injection and reported as 
[IU/mL]/[IU/kg]) 
 Terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2) 
 Area under the concentration-time curve  (AUC0-last) 
 Clearance 
 Volume of distributi on at steady state (V ss) 
 Tmax 
Cohorts 3 and 4:  
 Cmax after first dose (C max, Dose 1) and C max at steady state after final SC dose (C max,ss)

 Clearance 
 Volume of distributi on at steady state (V ss) 
 
 Tmax after first dose (T max, Dose 1) and T max after final dose (T max, ss) 
Methods of Assessment 
Blood samples for determination of FIX activity will be obtaine d before and after SC 
injection of rIX-FP at the time points detailed in the Schedule of Assessments for the SC 
substudy. 
A zero-time will be assigned as th e start of the injection, and  the residual FIX at the predose 
time point will be used as the baseline value for each administ ration.  FIX activity will be 
measured at a central laborator y using a validated one-stage cl otting method. 
Details regarding sample collection, handling, deep freezing of  samples and shipment to the 
central laboratory are given in the  Laboratory Manual in the In vestigator Site File.

 Local Tolerability Assessments  
Investigator  assessment:  For the SC injections administered at the study site (Doses 1, 2, 3, 
13, and 15), the investigator will perform assessments of local tolerability at the SC injection 
site(s). If several injection sites are used, each site will be judged but only the site with the 
strongest reaction will be recorded, according to the following scale:

Itching, Local Pain, or Local Heat  
The severity of any local reactions of itching, local pain, or local heat will be assessed based 
on the following classification: none (0), very slight (1), slight (2), mo derate (3), and severe 
(4).  
The investigator will perform l ocal tolerability assessments at the time  points detailed in the 
Cohort [ADDRESS_309890] assessment:  The subject (or caregiver) will assess l ocal tolerability at the SC injection

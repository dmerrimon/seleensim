 BACKGROUND AND STUDY  RATIONALE  
This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable University of Pennsylvania Research Policies and 
Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations . 
Introduction  
1.[ADDRESS_859033] for America’s Health in which Philadelphia  
was ranked as 14th nationwide for dr ug overdose related deaths.  
Ninety -nine percent of carpal tunnel surgery and other hand soft tissue releases such as trigger finger, are performed in the 
ambulatory setting 9,10. Post -operative pain prescriptions vary widely across hand surgeons in North America. In one study, 
Canadian hand surgeons prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_641759] 5 % of their ambulatory hand surgery patients whereas physicians in the United 
States prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_4976] 66% of their patients for similar surgeries11. Studies have investigated the role of post -operative 
non-steroidal anti -inflammatory (NSAIDS) in post -operative pain control for outpatient general surgery2,3. Given that there is no 
gold standard regimen for post -operative pain control after ambulatory hand surgery and considering the current opi[INVESTIGATOR_641760], it would be of utmost importance to establish whether a non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_641761]-operative analgesia to han d surgery patients. Our long term goal is to decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_641762].  
Patient satisfaction has become an increasingly important metric in healthcare quality and importantly in healthcar e payment 
policies12. In fact the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) incorporated patient satisfact ion in part of their value 
based incentive payments since 201213. Quality of Recovery has been linked to patient satisfaction after anesthesia and surgery6. 
Determining if the post -operati ve pain regimen has an influence on the Quality of Recovery Score is of prime importance in the 
consumer model of health care.  
 
[ADDRESS_859034] -operative pain after ambulatory hand surgery ( Aim 1 ). At the UPHS 
Orthopedics Department, approximately 600 cases of carpal tunnel and trigger finger releases are performed yearly. These 
patien ts commonly receive a Tylenol 3 script (acetaminophen 300mg, codeine 30 mg). If the script is placed electronically, the 
system automatically reverts it to the generic equivalent.  If the patient self -describes a previous adverse events to Tylenol 3 
(T3), the script is commonly substituted for oxycodone -acetaminophen (5mg -325mg). Drug diversion and the opi[INVESTIGATOR_641763] a public health concern and surgeons have the obligation to responsibly prescribe opi[INVESTIGATOR_79528] -operative 
analgesi a. Our ambulatory hand surgery patient population represents a unique opportunity for hand surgeons at UPHS to 
optimize post -operative pain prescription habits and study its impact on patient satisfaction. Our long term goal is to optimize 
post-operative p rescription practices at our institution and in hand surgery nationwide, while maintaining patient satisfaction 
(Aim 2)  and ultimately decrease drug diversion potential.

 2.1 Primary Objective : 
 
To establish, through a randomized control trial, whether post -operative Acetaminophen  and Ibuprofen (non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_173681]) 
would provide equivalent post -operative analgesia to ambulatory hand surgery patients compared to Acetaminophen and 
Codeine  (opi[INVESTIGATOR_173681]).  
Rationale:  In the setting of ambulatory hand surgery, many of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_641764]. In a telephone survey of 
patients undergoing ambulatory hand surgery, 52% of patients reported taking their prescribed analgesics for [ADDRESS_859035] -operative non -steroidal anti -inflammatory (NSAIDS) in post -operative pain 
control for outpatient surgery23,4, though never as a randomized control trial in hand surgery.  
Hypothesis:  A non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_641756] -operative regimen of ibuprofen and acetaminophen is equally effective with less side effects as 
Acetaminophen and codeine  for pain relief in the context of ambulatory hand surgery.  
Primary Outcome Variable:  Visual Analogue Scale Pain Score  
2.2 Secondary Objectives : 
 
To establish whether the opi[INVESTIGATOR_293993] -opi[INVESTIGATOR_641756] -operative pain regimen influences patient satisfaction through Quality of 
Recovery (QoR) scores in ambula tory hand surgery.  
Rational:  Quality of Recovery score is a validated health measure based on the answers of a [ADDRESS_859036]-operatively6.  
Hypothesis:  A non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_641756] -operative regimen will have equivalent Quality of Recovery scores to an opi[INVESTIGATOR_641756] -operative 
pain regimen.  
Secondary Outcome Variables : Adverse events, duration of medication intake, reason for medication discontinuat ion, patient 
satisfaction as determined by [CONTACT_641778] -9 (QoR -9). 
[ADDRESS_859037] -operative analgesia treatment groups: an opi[INVESTIGATOR_641765] -inflammatory and acetaminophen (400mg/650mg) treatment group. Patients in one group will receive 
either 650  mg of ace taminophen and 400  mg of ibuprofen per dose. Patients in group two will receive  300mg of acetaminophen and 
30 mg of codeine (T3 equivalent) per dose. The active medications will be encapsulated into identical capsules containing half o f the 
full dose (2 ca psules  = 1 dose). The capsules will then be dispensed in identical bottles . The first dose will be administered in the post -
anesthesia care unit (PACU).  The visual analogue scale (VAS) is simple and commonly used in the clinical setting to measure pain 
severity14,15. The patients will complete a post -operative pain diary. The entries will consist of a VAS, time of medication intake 
and side effects (nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, other). Date and reasons for medication discontinuation (pain fr ee 
versus adverse effect) will also be recorded. The first entry will be recorded pre-operatively to ensure comprehension of the 
VAS as well as to obtain baseline pain score. The second entry will be in the recovery room.  The patients will complete four 
entries daily which corresponds to allowed intake of pain medication over a period o f [ADDRESS_859038]-operative visit (ranging from [ADDRESS_859039] -operatively). All patients will be called on post -operative day [ADDRESS_859040] -op d2:

Post -op day [ADDRESS_859042] visit generally rang es from 6 to 8 days  after 
their surgery . At this visit the patient will return the diary  and remaining medication . This will conclude the patient’s participation in 
the study.  
3.1.4  Allocation to Interventional Group  
Stratified block randomization using tables o f random numbers, stratified according to hand surgery type (carpal tunnel, trigger finger) 
will be used to ensure equivalent numbers of patients in each treatment group for each of the 2 procedures. Patients wi ll be 
randomized in blocks of 4 . Randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_21212] (IDS) using computer -generated 
tables.  The treatment allocation will be concealed from the study investigators, physicians, nurses, patients, and statistic ian. 
Allocation assignments wi ll be held securely in the IDS until all primary analyses are performed; this code will be broken for 
subgroup and post hoc analyses. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized into one of two post -operative analgesia 
treatment groups: an opi[INVESTIGATOR_641766] -inflammatory and acetaminophen (400mg/650mg) treatment group. Patients 
in one group will receive either 650  mg of acetaminophen and 400  mg of ibuprofen per dose. Patients in group two will receive 300mg 
of acetaminophen a nd 30  mg of codeine (T3 equivalent) per dose. The active medications will be encapsulated into identical capsules 
containing half of the full dose (2 capsules  = 1 dose). The capsules will then be dispensed in identical bottles. In this manner, both 
patient s and investigators are blinded.  
3.2 Study Endpoints  
3.2.1  Primary Study Endpoints  
Ten millimeter Pain Visual Analogue Scale.  
 
We chose a threshold of 5  mm difference in VAS score to ensure that even a smaller efficacy difference could be identified 
statistically . 
 
3.2.2  Secondary Study Endpoints  
Adverse events, duration of medication intake, reason for medication discontinuation, patient satisfaction as determined by t he Quality 
of Recovery -9 (QoR -9). 
4 Study Population and Duration of Participation  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Patients > 18 years old, undergoing ambulatory hand surgery for carpal tunnel  and trigger finger, under local anesthesia with or

5.2 Intervention Regimen  
 
Dose: Acetaminophen 650 mg; Ibuprofen 400 mg; Codeine 30 mg  
Route: blinded opaque oral capsules  
Frequency: 1st dose given in PACU on day of surgery; every  6 hours as needed for pain (4 times daily)  
Duration: Total of [ADDRESS_859045], IDS would prepare 30 blinded capsules (containing either APAP 300/Co deine 30, or APAP 325/IBU 200 per 
capsule) and dispense from IDS main location (Ground Maloney, HUP) the day before surgery or the IDS satellite (1 Mutch, Penn 
Presby[CONTACT_641780]) on day before or the morning of surgery.  
 
The IDS will purchase APA P 300mg/Codeine 30mg tablets, APAP 325mg tablets and Ibuprofen 200mg tablets commercially.  IDS 
will purchase pharmaceutical -grade opaque gelatin capsules and NF (National Formulary) grade inert fillers (microcrystalline 
cellulose NF) from FDA -registered f acilities.  All encapsulation takes place using 316 -grade surgical stainless steel equipment.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.   
  
5.4 Storage  
All medication will be stored in the Investigational Drug Service, which maintains high level security and is inaccessible to  non-IDS 
personnel, inc luding other members of the study team.  Medication is maintained at USP controlled room temperature (20 -25 Celsius) 
in tightly -sealed containers which comply with USP<671> and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act.  
  
5.[ADDRESS_859046] in a controlled environment following cGCP and USP<795> guidelines, with all activities performed by 
[CONTACT_641781].  
 
Medication will be packaged in standard USP<671> -compliant prescription packag ing by [CONTACT_641782], pursuant to an individual 
signed or electronically -transmitted legal prescription for each study participant.  Medication will be dispensed in a sealed, labeled 
package on the day of surgery and transferred to a member of the study te am who will provide the medication to the participant prior 
to discharge from the surgery center.   
 
5.6 Blinding  
 
The Investigational Drug Service will prepare medication for both treatment conditions, which is indistinguishable to the stu dy team 
or to study participants.  IDS staff will assign subjects sequentially to treatment arms following the secure randomization tables 
(maintained in the IDS) as prescriptions are received and medication dispensed.  
 
The IDS maintains an emergency unmasking website t hrough Penn Medicine Academic Computing Services, through which the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_67101], in an emergency situation, obtain access to the treatment assignment for one individual p articipant.  The website is secured both 
through PennKey authentication and because only an  IDS pharmacist can grant individual user access to an individual trial.  The 
website maintains an audit trail of all unmasking activity and categorizes requests for later follow -up.   
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_859047] system is accessible only to IDS personnel and the Direc tor of 
IDS has ultimate control over all user accounts.  The system uses electronic, time/date -stamped signatures for every transaction, as 
well as maintains patient profiles which span all research participation longitudinally as well as across all schools and res earchers who 
use IDS services, in compliance with Pennsylvania Code.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_859048]-operative pain diary  (please refer to attached) .  
In this diary, they are asked to record side effects and the number of doses taken within a [ADDRESS_859049]’s course of treatment, is returned to the IDS, where research technicians count  and log 
the returned quantities under the subject’s profile in the accountability system.  Electronic, blinded patient -return reports can be 
generated for the study team to assist in calculating patient compliance with the regimen.

 6.2 Study Intervention Phase  
6.2.1  Visit 1 ( operative day)   
Patients will be  randomized to either study group the day of their su rgery .  They will receive the first dose of the study medication 
while they are in the recovery room.  Subjects will complete the pain diary 4 times every day following surgery (3 times the day of 
surger y).   
6.2.2  Follow Up   
 
Telephone:  Patients will be contact[CONTACT_641783] 2nd post-operative day to administer the QoRs -9. Patients will also be 
telephoned on the day prior to their first post -operative visit as a reminder to bring the diary and remain der of the medication.  
Clinic Visit: Patients will return to clinic for their first post -operative visit (generally 6 to 8 days after their surgery).  
 
6.2.3  End of Study Visit  
 
The study will conclude at the time of the patient’s first post -operative encounter  with their treating hand surgeon (usually between [ADDRESS_859051] -operative days) . After conclusion of the study, the patient’s will continue on their regular post -operative schedule as deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_641784].  
 
Patients will be unblinde d after final data analysis.  
6.[ADDRESS_859052] their treating physician during the course of the study , and/or schedule an early visit if deemed 
necessary . Data collection will proceed as initially described unless the  patient requires unblinding.  
6.[ADDRESS_859053] Withdrawal /Early Termination Visits   
If the patient experiences self -described pain that is poorly controlled or an adverse event, their physician or treatment team will 
evaluate the patient as deemed appropriated and prescribe alternative medications  if necessary.  Subjects who withdraw early will 
continue to follow with their treating hand surgeons as per standard of care.  We will follow intention to treat in our statistical analysis. 
Hence if a patient requires unblin ding, the last available measurement for each individual at the time point prior to withdrawal from 
the study will be retained in the analysis .

7 Statistical Plan  
All analyses comparing the treatment groups were conducted on an intention -to-treat basis. Two -tailed tests were used at all times, and 
statistical significance was set a priori at P<0.05.  
7.1 Primary  Endpoint  
The primary end point of this study is pain intensity,  measured with a 100 -mm VAS (with 0 mm being no pain and 100 mm being 
maximum pain), and analyzed as daily mean scores.  In patients that will have forgotten to complete the VAS scores [ADDRESS_859057] recorded score.  
7.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Adverse events, duration of medication intake, reason for medication discontinuation, patient satisfaction as determined by t he Quality 
of Recovery -9 (QoR -9). 
7.3 Sample Size and Power Determination  
A sample size of 63 in each group has 80  % power to detect a difference in means of [ADDRESS_859058] deviation of 
10 mm by a two -group Student’s t test with a 0.05 two -sided significance level.  Assuming a 3 0% lost to follow -up and failure to 
comply with study protocol, [ADDRESS_859059] deviations (SDs), medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) or frequencies and percentages, as 
appropriate, to summarize baseline characteristics. We will assessed comparisons between participants who did and did not tak e 
analg esia using an unpaired t test for continuous variables and a Pearson χ2 test for categorical variables.  We will use a parametric 
student t test to assess the primary end point (VAS).

All-treated population :  Any subject s randomized into the study that received at least one dose  of either Acetaminophen/codeine or 
acetaminophen/ibuprofen.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the 
study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures a re 
considered to be  adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_450339]  
 
8.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or sig nificant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significan ce.   They 
may jeopardize the su bject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug 
overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency 
departme nt would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse events .  
 
8.[ADDRESS_859061] (such as the post -op telephone  calls and the post -op clinic visit), the investigator will seek information 
on adverse events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be rec orded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly 
related signs, symptoms, should be recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period will be  recorded.  The clinical course of each event will be followed until 
resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study intervention or participation is not the cause.  Se rious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse 
event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study intervention or study particip ation will be 
recorded and reported immediate ly. 
8.3 Relationship of AE to Study  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_641767], 
probably related, possibly related, unlikely or unrelated.  
8.4 Reporting of Adverse  Events and Unanticipated Problems  
We will report adverse events and/or unanticipated problems in accordance with the Penn IRB policy on Reportable Events .

8.[ADDRESS_859062] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the s ubject 
of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects  in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or  use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all 
information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to coll ect or use 
PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permiss ion to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their 
scheduled study period.  
9.[ADDRESS_859063] methods to capture electronic data: these are RedCap  and secure departmental 
shared drives on the UPHS servers behind the UPHS firewalls. We also routinely code files by [CONTACT_641785].  
Data will only be accessed by [CONTACT_641786].   Data will be stored for at least [ADDRESS_859064] 7 years after the study ends.  The storage of the study records will be in accordan ce with 
departmental and institutional policies/requirements.   
10 Study Monitoring , Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB, the sponsor, government regulatory 
bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory 
documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of app licable 
study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_523874] s and 
applicable University compliance and quality assurance offices.

Background: 
Propofol is one of the most common drugs used for induction and 
maintenance of general of anesthesia. The main advantage of propofol, which 
contributed to its popularity, is its rapid onset and short duration of action. When 
administered as an IV bolus, the clinical effects wane within a few minutes[1]. The 
main mechanism of action of propofol is its interaction with the GABA receptor; 
and it has a short duration of action due to rapid distribution into peripheral 
tissues[2]. 
One of the main disadvantages of propofol is iatrogenic hypotension, with 
an incidence as high as 68% [3-5], associated with increased requirement of 
vasopressor administration[6] and higher mortality and negative outcomes[7, 8]. 
One study reported that general anesthesia with propofol at doses 125 and 200 
ucg/kg/min decreases the mean arterial pressure from 8543 to 6945 and 6644 
mmHg, respectively[9]. 
Another author reported that increasing the mean propofol Cb 3.0 (0.9), 4.5 
(1.0), and 6.5 (1.2) ug ml71 decreases bispectral index spectrometry (BIS) 
measurements to 54 (13), 39 (8), and 29 (7), respectively. Increasing 
concentrations of propofol led to venous dilatation; and mean arterial pressure 
from 82 (12) to 75 (12) and 66 (10) mm Hg, respectively, at the three propofol Cb 
levels (P < 0.001)[10]. 
On the other hand, a prospective, double-blind, open-label, randomized 
study in the [LOCATION_002] has reported only 17.4% incidence of propofol-induced 
hypotension[11]. 
There are multiple risk factors and comorbidities which increase the relative 
risk (RR) of propofol-induced hypotension. In his study, Abdelmonem et al. (2019) 
demonstrated that advanced age, higher APACHE II score, sepsis, diabetes, acute 
and chronic kidney diseases, cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation are associated with higher 
RR of Propofol induced hypotension development, when compared with the cohort 
group [34] 
Age is an independent factor associated with severe hypotension. A study 
reported that approximately half of patients sedated with propofol experienced 
hypotension are above the age of 60 [35]. It has been shown that age is the 
Version 09/2024 301220-UT Approved 3 
10/08/[ADDRESS_547082] risk factor for propofol-induced hypotension, and propofol should be 
given with significant caution within certain age groups[12]. 
Multiple studies describe the mechanism of this phenomenon, yet the exact mechanism is fully unknown. Possible reasons of hypotension after propofol 
administration may be either due to propofol-mediated decreases in preload, 
cardiac output ané contractility[13, 14], decreased in afterload and systemic 
vascular resistance[15-20], or sudden cessation of sympathetic vasomotor 
activity[21-24]. The above described hypothesis is supported with the fact that a 
preoperative bolus of fluids helps maintain the hemodynamic stability during 
induction with propofol[25]. However, in animal models, propofol demonstrated a 
property of direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle[26-33]. Moreover, this 
property of propofol most likely has been achieved via nitric oxide[28] and veins 
seems to be more sensitive than arterioles[26, 31]. 
An anonymous survey conducted at the Department of Anesthesiology at UTMC revealed that 63% of anesthesiologists starting their induction with the 
sequence of follow medications: Fentanyl-Lidocaine-Propofol-Succinylcholine. 
27% of them administer propofol within 10 seconds via manual push, 45% within 
10-20 seconds and less than 30% of anesthesiologists administer propofol in 60 
seconds or longer. 
Majority of anesthesiologists (45%) are calculating the dose of propofol 
based on ideal body weight and titrating it until desired hypnotic effect is achieve 
instead of administering of full pre-induction calculated dose (72%). 
This wide variability in anesthesiologic practice at The Department of 
Anesthesiology UTMC is based on training, experience, and a comfort level of the 
provider. Nevertheless, all anesthesiologic approaches mentioned above are 
acceptable and being safely used for routine daily management for years. 
Summary of Background: 
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of propofol, such as fast 
onset of action, rapid distribution, smooth awakening, and low rate of 
nausea/vomiting make propofol the most preferable hypnotic medication for 
induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Compared to midazolam, propofol allows 
better and precise control of the depth of anesthesia with less side effects.

10/08/[ADDRESS_547083] induction rate (manual 
push within 10-20 seconds). By [CONTACT_432101], we will be able to 
determine the optimal rate of induction in order to avoid propofol-related 
hypotension during elective surgeries. 
Study Objectives: 
Primary Aim 
To evaluate the association between induction rate using propofol and post- 
induction hemodynamic stability in patients. 
Secondary Aim 
To evaluate the necessity of inotropic or vasoactive medication use in the 
early post-induction period, required to correct propofol-induced hypotension. 
Tertiary Aim 
Version 09/2024 301220-UT Approved 
10/08/[ADDRESS_547084]-operative period, shorter length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_432098] a lower 30-day mortality. 
Study Designs: 
Cluster randomized, non-blinded, cohort trial. Study will be conducted, and 
patient will be enrolled at the main Operating Unit of The University of Toledo 
Medical Center, Toledo Ohio. 
Study Methods: 
Propofol can be administered during induction as fast (within 10-20 
seconds), as well as slow for 60 seconds and longer. Both types of inductions are 
being safely used at our department. To compare the benefit of slow speed 
Version 09/2024 301220-UT Approved 6 
10/08/2024
propofol induction on hemodynamic stability, we decided to compare two 
practices. 
We plan to compare the rate of propofol administration: a bolus within 
approximately 10-20 seconds vs. slow administration of propofol within 120 
seconds. The hypnotic properties of propofol will not be affected by [CONTACT_134404], as 
propofol is approved by [CONTACT_432102] (continuous infusion) anesthesia. [FDA revised form: DIPRIVAN® (propofol) injectable emulsion, USP, 451094H Revised: April 2017 
[36]. 
As this study does not aim to change any anesthesiologic practice, but 
simply trying to compare difference in current practices, we are planning to apply 
to Institutional Review Board for patient consent waiver. Our rational behind this, 
is that we do not plan to add, or change any medication that anesthesiologist will 
plan to use for each patient. And the patient does not choose the provider, and with 
equal odd can be taken care of either one or another provider. 
On the morning of the surgery, eligible and consented subjects will be 
randomized into two groups: groups A and B. Randomization will be done in 
advance using Excel Randomization function with allocation 1:1 per groups: 
Sample size of 100, two groups, [ADDRESS_547085]. 
Group A: Staff anesthesiologist will calculate the dose of Propofol (Any 
patient, who was not planned to get Propofol for induction does not meet the 
Inclusion Criteria and will not be enrolled in this study). Current study has no 
intervention on Propofol dose calculation. The Research Member will ensure that 
the calculated dose of Propofol is being administered by a primary anesthesia 
provider intra-venously during 10-20 seconds via manual bolus per FDA approved administration speed (20-40 mg/per 10 seconds). 
Group B: Staff anesthesiologist will calculate the dose of Propofol (Any 
patient, who was not planned to get Propofol for induction does not meet the 
Inclusion Criteria and will not be enrolled in this study). Current study has no 
intervention on Propofol dose calculation. The Research Member will ensure that 
the calculated dose of Propofol is being administered by [CONTACT_432103]-venously during 120 seconds via Alaris Syringe Module. The reason of a 
syringe pump use is to eliminate any duration differences among patients in Group 
B; 
Version 09/2024 301220-UT Approved 7 
10/08/[ADDRESS_547086] system, as well as Outpatient Athena Electronic 
system. 
Propofol has been used for decades in anesthesiology and ICU settings. It is 
being safely used as a bolus administration for induction (as stated in FDA form: 
20-40 mg for 10 seconds) as well as continuous intra-venous infusion for sedation 
of patients in ICU. Additionally, Total Intra-Venous Anesthesia (aka. TIVA) 
represents a constant prolong Intra-Venous Administration of IV anesthetics 
(nowadays Propofol is the drug of choice for TIVA) instead of volatile anesthetic 
as a sedation agent of general anesthesia. Considering that both fast bolus and 
continuous prolong Intra-Venous administration of Propofol has been safely used 
for decades, the research team hypothesize that: 
1. Group A represents the Propofol administration group with FDA approved 
administration rate of 20-40 mg/ per [ADDRESS_547087], 
patients in group A are not different than any other patient receiving an 
anesthesia care for an elective surgery at UTMC. 
2. Group B patients are not in a higher risk associated with a longer Propofol 
administration (120 seconds) than any patient receiving a continuous 
prolong Propofol administration which is a common practice in medicine 
and has been safely used for years. 
For the primary randomization, Patient's MRN will be collected which will 
be kept in Key code document. The information of Biometric data (such as weight, 
age, type of surgery, ASA status, surgery start and end time, proprofol 
administration time),constant vital data (such as blood pressure, heart rate, 
saturation) as well as any vaso-active or inotropic medication (such as 
Phhenylephrine, Ephedrine, Vasopressine, Norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
Dobutamine), as well as amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] (such as Fentanyl, 
Hydromorphone) and intravenous fluids (such as Lactated Ringer, Normal Saline, 
Albumin) administered during the surgery will be collected and stored in a "Data 
Collecting Sheet" attached to this IRB form. Additionally, any antihypertensive 
medications taken prior to surgery will be documented on the data collection sheet. 
Antihypertensive medication taken the day of the surgery can become a 
confounder for hypotensive events during the induction of anesthesia. Thus, the

Statistical analysis: 
Assuming a standard deviation of [ADDRESS_547089] an 80% power at a 
significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_547090] a 10 mm Hg difference in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) reduction is 
[ADDRESS_547091] deviation is 15 mm Hg. And this will increase the power of 
the study up to 90%. 
Sample Size: 
Total of [ADDRESS_547092] shown that total of 46 patient should be the 
minimum sample size, we decided to double this number to improve the power of 
the study and detection of even small changes in hemodynamics alterations.

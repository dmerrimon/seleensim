Analysis Plan: Pharmacokinetics of Advantage Arrest  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Document Date: 0 7/30/[ADDRESS_574336] for 
baseline levels.   
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using Phoenix WinNonlin (Certara).  
• The time to peak concentration (T max), observed and baseline- corrected peak 
concentrations (C max), and observed 24- h concentration (C 24 h) will be reported.  
• The elimination rate constant (k elim) will be determined by [CONTACT_450570] a 
minimum of 3 time points with decreasing concentrations over time observed after the 
peak concentration. 
• Half-life (t 1/2) will be calculated as ln(2)/k elim. 
• Area under the curve (AUC): The 24- hour AUC (AUC 0-24 hr) will be calculated using a log-
linear trapezoidal rule of baseline- corrected serum concentrat ions from time = 0 to 24 h. 
The AUC 0-∞ will be calculated using a log- linear trapezoidal rule of baseline- corrected 
serum concentrations and extrapolated to infinite time by C 24hour/kelim, where C 24hour is the 
24 hour concentration.  
• The percent extrapolat ed AUC will be calculated as (AUC 0−∞ − AUC 0–24 hr)/AUC 0−∞ x 100.  
• The total urinary recovery of fluoride  and silver  will be determined by [CONTACT_450571] 24 hours by [CONTACT_450572]  24 hours.  
Statistical analysis will be performed using Excel to calculate the mean ± standard deviation for 
the pharmacokinetic parameters .  No statistical comparisons will be made  as it is a single arm 
study.

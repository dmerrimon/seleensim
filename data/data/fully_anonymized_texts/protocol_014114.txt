4 1.0 Introduction  
The 2011 FDA Final Rule [1]  describes the procedures for determining the static sun 
protection factor (SPF )of over -the-counter (OTC) sunscreen product s. 
 
The static SPF is defined as the ratio of the minimal erythema dose of ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation for sunscreen -protected skin to that for unprotected skin.  The minimal 
erythema dose (MED) is the lowest dose of UV radiation that produces the first 
perceptible erythem a with clearly defined borders (covering more than 50%  
of the exposure site ), 16 to 24 hours  (hrs) after UV exposure  administration.  UV 
radiation doses, expressed in Joules/ square meter (J/m2), are administered using a 
xenon arc lamp that simulates solar radiation  and satisfies the requirements of the FDA 
Final Rule [1].  
 
 
2.0 Objective 
The objective of this study is  to determine  the static SPF of three sunscreen  products 
using the methodology described in the  FDA Final Rule (2011) [1]. 
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_745112] s 
Three sunscreen lip balms will be evaluated ; each has a target SPF of 15 . 
• ChapStick Lip Moisturizer Original ( ; cocoa butter fragrance)  
• ChapStick Lip Moisturizer Mint Flavour ( ) 
• ChapStick Lip Moisturizer Black Cherry Flavour  ( )  
 An SPF  Standard  (7% Padimate -O and 3% Oxybenzone) will  be evaluated  alongside 
the three test products . 
 
4.0 Study Design/Blinding  
Test treatments  (SPF standard, test products  and unprotected sites) will be  randomized 
to test sites  to ensure  blinded evaluation of erythemal response . Eligible participants 
will be assigned to treatment based on the randomization schedule  on Day [ADDRESS_745113] and an  unprotected site ( MEDuR) to test site  shall follow the  randomization 
schedule generated by  [CONTACT_567288] . If the back of a participant

5 cannot accommodate  a minimum of 6 sites (too small, unsuitable areas of anatomical 
curvature), the participant will be discontinued.  
 
Note:  A minimum of  [ADDRESS_745115] reapplication be necessary due to uneven/  
inconsistent application to help ensure  UV exposures can be completed for all study 
treatments. 
 
For practical reasons, the only site that may  be known to the erythema evaluator is the 
Initial Unprotected MED (MEDu I) site.  If the evaluator has questions about test site 
locations and/or exposure site locations, the evaluator may receive assist ance from the 
technician s who applied the test materials and administered the UV doses; the 
technician s should not influence the evaluator in the grading of UV responses.  
 Study duration is expected to be 3- 8 days.  
 
5.0 Participants  
Potential study participants will be recruited from  Volunteer Database per SOPs 
. 
 
The FDA Final Rule (2011) [1] requires the test panel to produce a minimum of [ADDRESS_745116]  tested; invalid data from a maximum of [ADDRESS_745117] may be rejected  (i.e., 10–13 participants  and ≥ [ADDRESS_745118] ). 
Therefore, a  maximum of [ADDRESS_745119] required for SPF labeling [1].  
 Study participants will be healthy male and female volunteers with skin types I, II or 
III (Table 1: Fitzpatrick Skin Types ). Individual Typology Angle (ITA°) will be measured 
for each participant to determine  skin type.  No discrimination  of any kind  (e.g. social 
class, gender, skin color, ethnicity) should preclude eligible participants from 
participating in the study.

The PI, or designated  designe e(s), is responsible for detecting, documenting and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE .  
 
The PI, or designated designe e(s), is responsible  for following up serious AEs (SAEs) ; 
AEs considered to be test product (or study procedure) related ; and AEs  that caused 
the participant to discontinue  or be withdrawn from the study . 
 10.1 D
efinition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  participant, temporally 
associated with the use of a test product, whether or not considered related to the test 
product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a test product.  
 
Events Meeting the AE Definition:  
• Unexpected  or unusual reactions which occur within a test site  that cannot be 
completely described by [CONTACT_567297] 8 (e.g., hives) will be recorded as AEs.  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or 
urinalysis) or other safety assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), including those that worsen after test product administration , 
considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_567271]  (i.e., not related to progression of underlying 
disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either 
an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  after test product 
administration.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after test product administration, even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study .  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug- drug interaction.

product or a concomitant  medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
• ‘Lack of efficacy ’ per se will not be reported as an AE. Such instances will be 
captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or 
clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE if they fulfill 
the definition of an AE.

abnormal safety assessments which are associated with an  underlying disease, 
unless judged by [CONTACT_978], or medically qualified designee,  to be more severe than 
expected for the participant's condition.  
• A medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy) is not an AE. 
The condition that leads to the procedure is the  AE (e.g., gastritis, appendicitis).  
• Situations where an untowa rd medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations in  a pre-existing disease /condition present or 
detected at the start of the study  that did  not worsen.  
• Localized erythema caused by [CONTACT_567298].  
 10.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is a particular category of AE  where the adverse outcome is serious. If an event 
is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met.  
 
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
- The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does 
not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe .  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
- In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91261]/or treatment that would not have been 
appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospit alization are AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ’ occurred, or was necessary, 
the AE should be considered serious.  
- Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did 
not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity

24 - The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  
- This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor 
medical significance such as an uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere w ith or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Other situations:  
- Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations , such as important medical 
events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , but may jeopardize the participant  or may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes list ed in the 
above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.  
- Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions th at do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Note: Classification of an AE as 'serious' is based on the outcome of the event and is a 
factor in determining reporting requirements.  
 10.3 Expected Events  
UV Expected Events:  
Possible/expected side effects on and/or around the test sites  associated with UV 
exposure include the following:  
• Erythema (sunburn)  
• Mild discomfort  
• Itching  
• Edema (swelling)  
• Dryness/Tightness  
• Peeling

[ADDRESS_745166] products may not perform up to the  expected 
protection level.  Under protection outcomes are potential anticipated events and are 
also not to be considered AEs.  However, if any of th ese parameters/outcomes appear 
to be highly exacerbated, more than normally associated with the test procedures as determined by [CONTACT_978] , or designee, and lead to discontinuation , the event will be 
documented as an AE.    
 
Sk
incare Product Expected Events:  
There is always the  possibility of irritation or a skin reaction to any product  applied to 
the skin .  Examples of possible skincare product reactions are:  
• Redness  
• Dryness/tightness  
• Peeling  
• Itching  
• Burning/stinging  
• Allergic  reaction  
 Any skin reaction associated with the application of a test product to the test site will 
be considered an AE and documented as such.  
  
10.4. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
All AEs, and therefore all SAEs , will be collected immediately after a participant  
provides consent to participate in the trial by [CONTACT_1174] (sign ing) of the ICF and 
until [ADDRESS_745167] (or last study procedure).  
Medical occurrences that began before obtaining informed consent will be recorded in 
the source documentation as Medical History/Current Medical Conditions , not as AEs.  
 All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor , or designee , immediately and 
under no circumstance should this exceed [ADDRESS_745168],

Each participant  will be questioned about AEs . Spontaneous ly report ed AEs and those 
elicited by [CONTACT_191993] -directive questions  (such as "How do you feel ?") will be 
assessed , recorded in AE -specific source documentation and reported appropriately. 
The PI, or medically qualified designee , is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs 
spontaneously reported by a participant . 
 Each AE should be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for a SAE. If an SAE 
occurs,  expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as 
appropriate.  
 When an AE occurs, it is the responsibility of the PI, or medically qualified designee , to 
review all documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The PI,  or designee,  will record all relevant information 
regarding an AE in AE -specific source documentation and all details relating to an SAE 
on the paper SAE f orm provided.  
 
It is not acceptable for the PI, or medically qualified designee , to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] a 
participan t’s medical records to [COMPANY_004] CH in lieu of completion of AE -specific  source  
documentation or the SAE  form. There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_567273]. In this instance, all participant  identifiers, except for 
the participant number, will be redacted prior to sharing with [COMPANY_004] CH.  
 The PI, or medically qualified designee , will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the 
event base d on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. The diagnosis 
should be the documented as the AE/SAE , where known, and not the individual 
signs/symptoms (e. g., upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], seasonal allergy ; not cough, 
runny nose).  
 AEs elicited by [CONTACT_978], or medically qualified designee , during study visits should be 
recorded in AE -specific source documentation  and/or using the SAE form , as 
appropriate . Care will be taken not to introduce bias when questioning a participant 
about changes in their health. Open -ended and non -directive  verbal questioning should 
be used.  
 Reporting an Adverse Event :  
AEs will be reported using AE -specific source documentation by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_567274] -supplied SAE form , when appropriate , using concise medical terminology . 
Where the same data are collected, AE -specific source documentation  and the SAE 
form must be completed in a consistent manner ; the same AE term s should be used on 
both.

[ADDRESS_745172] copi[INVESTIGATOR_567275]. Original SAE forms should be retained in 
the Investigator Trial Master File .  
 It is essential to enter the following information:  
• Protocol and participant  identifiers  
• Participant  demography  
• Description of event (s), with diagnosis if available  
• PI [INVESTIGATOR_567276] (or study  procedure, if appropriate)  
• Criterion for seriousness  
 
The following are desirable and are of particular relevance for PI  [INVESTIGATOR_567277]:  
• Date of onset of event   
• Date event  stoppe d, if relevant  
• Test product start date  
• Test product end date , if relevant  
• Action taken in relation to the test product  
• Outcome if known  
 The SAE form, completed as fully as possible, must be scanned and e -mailed to the 
[COMPANY_004] CH Clinical Operations Safety  Reporting email box with the [COMPANY_004] CH study  number 
and participant number in the title  field of the email immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours  after study  site personnel learn of the 
event. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_567278] 24 hours  of it being available. The [COMPANY_004]

28 during the study  and will assign one of the following categories . 
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299] , causing minimal 
discomfort  and not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate:  An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities  
• Severe:  An event that prevents normal everyday activities.  
 
NOTE:  An AE classified  as ‘severe’ should not be  confused with an SAE.  
‘Severe’ is  a category utilized to classify  the intensity of an event; both non -serious AEs 
and SAEs can be classified  as ‘severe’ . For example, a headache may be ‘ severe’ 
(interferes significantly with the participant 's usual function) but would not be classified 
as ‘serious ’ unless it met one of the criteria for an SAE, as described above  (Section 
1.2.2.). An event is defined as 'serious' when it meets at least 1 of the p re-defined 
outcomes as described  in Section 1.2.2., not when it is classified  as ‘severe’. 
 
Assessment of Causality  
Causality is one of the criteria used to  determin e regulatory reporting requirements. 
For each AE (serious and non -serious), the PI, or med ically qualified designee , must 
provide an assessment of causality i n the AE -specific source documentation and, for 
SAEs,  on the SAE form.  
 The PI, or medically qualified designee , will use clinical judgment to determine 
causality, having also  consult ed the Safety Statement provided by [CONTACT_567300] . Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, other 
risk factors and the temporal relationship of the event to the test product will also be 
taken into consider ation and investigated.  
 There may be situations whe re an SAE has occurred , and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_567279]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_567280] ; 
they may change their  opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information and send an 
SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
 Relationship to Test  Material  
The relationship or association of the AE to test product  will be characterized as 
‘unlikely ’, ‘possible ’ or ‘probable ’ (Table 10).  
 
A ‘reasonable possibility ’ of relationship conveys  there are facts, evidence and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The facts , evidence and/or arguments which  suggest a causal relationship should 
be provided in the AE report .  
 
For safety analyses, AEs classified as a ‘ possible ’ or ‘probable ’ association to test 
product  shall be considered test product -related AEs.

 10.8. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event  
Withdrawal due to an AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of an AE noted earlier, and recorded i n the appropriate AE -
specific source document. When a participant  withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE 
must be reported as already  described.  
 10.9. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
[COMPANY_004] CH has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, the local regulatory authority and other regulatory authorities about the safety of a product under clinical 
investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_567281].  
 
[COMPANY_004] CH will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority  and IRB, and other investigators if applicable .  
 Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators , as required.  
 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAE f rom the sponsor ) will 
review it, file it with the Safety Statement in the Investigator Trial Master File  and then 
notify the IRB, if appropriate , according to local requirements.

. Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks after  
the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy  will be reported.  
 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE, abnormal pregnancy outcomes 
(e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic 
pregnancy) are, and should be recorded as an SAE. Any female particip ant who 
becomes pregnant during the study  will be withdrawn. If a female participant later 
discovers they were pregnant during the study, i.e., after their participation completed, 
their data will be considered valid for statistical analysis purposes .

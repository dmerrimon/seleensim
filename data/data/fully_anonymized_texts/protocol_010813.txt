transplant from a HCV -positive donor . Eligible subjects will receive a heart  transplant 
from a deceased -donor with genotype 1 or 4  HCV , and then will receive  12 weeks of 
Zepatier after heart  transplantation when infection with HCV  is confirmed in these 
heart  transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] . Treatment will be complete after 12 weeks. * 
 
* Patients with Genotype 1a and Genotype [ADDRESS_326164] polymorphisms at positions M28, Q30, L31, and/or Y93, treatment with 
Zepatier will be extended to 16 weeks, rather than 12 weeks, and renally -adjusted 
Ribavirin at the clinician’s discretion will be initiated, and continued for the remainder 
of therapy (until the 16 week mark).  Such a strategy will provide optimal treatment, 
without delaying therapy prior to receipt of results of NS5A drug resistant testing.

donor  
Plan for statistical analysis  Primary endpoint:  
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/2018 
5 • Post -treatment sustained virologic  response ( SVR)  
Secondary endpoints:  
• Determine if there are major adverse events attributable to HCV  therapy in 
post -heart  transplant patients.  
• Evaluate 1 -year heart  graft survival in HCV -negative patients who receive a 
heart  transplant from an HCV -positive donor  
• Determine the rates of sponta neous HCV  clearance among HCV -negative 
patients with heart failure  receiving a heart  from an HCV -positive donor  
 
Data analysis:  
The primary analysis will be based on a calculation of SVR rates (number of 
subjects with SVR-12; negative HCV  RNA  12 weeks after completing Zepatier  
therapy) / (number of subjects treated with Zepatier  post -heart  transplantation)

Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/[ADDRESS_326169]  
Since 2006, there has been a 50% increase in the number of adults added to the heart transplant waitlist in the 
US. Yet the persistent organ donor shortage has led to only a 25% increase in the number of transplants, and a 
25% increase in the number of patients removed from  the heart transplant waitlist because of death or 
becoming too sick to transplant, reaching nearly [ADDRESS_326170] devices 
(VADs), which can prolong patient survival and improve quality -of-life, they are not a panacea. Long -term 
survival is superior for patients receiving a heart transplant, and VADs are not an option for patients with several 
forms of end -stage heart disease (i.e.,  arrhythmia disorders). Thus there is a critical need to expand the pool of 
heart donors in order to save more lives from end -stage heart disease.   
 
We will perform  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_267829] -positive organs for HCV -negative 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], by [CONTACT_267869] 20  HCV -negative subjects with heart s from HCV -positive donors, and then treating 
these subjec ts’ with Zepatier  in the early post -transplant phase in order to cure their HCV . If any subjects clear 
HCV spontaneously within the first four weeks post -transplantation, and do not require treatment, subjects will 
be added until there have been at least 20  HCV -negative subjects who receive a heart  transplant from an HCV -
positive donor, develop HCV, and are then treated for their HCV with Zepatier .

10 4 CHAPTER 1: BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
4.1. Background 
Since 2006, there has been a 50% increase in the numbe r of adults added to the heart transplant waitlist in the 
US. Yet the persistent organ donor shortage has led to only a 25% increase in the number of transplants, and a 
25% increase in the number of patients removed from the heart transplant waitlist becau se of death or 
becoming too sick to transplant, reaching nearly [ADDRESS_326171] devices 
(VADs), which can prolong patient survival and improve quality -of-life, they are not a panacea. Long -term 
survival is superior for patients receiving a heart transplan t, and VADs are not an option for patients with several 
forms of end -stage heart disease (i.e.,  right ventricular dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ). Thus there is 
a critical need to expand the pool of heart donors in order to save more lives from e nd-stage heart disease.   
The current treatment paradigm of HCV has evolved to the point that we should reconsider transplanting hearts 
from HCV -positive donors into HCV -negative patients in order to greatly increase the number of lifesaving heart 
transplan ts. The potential for liver disease and coronary vasculopathy, coupled with logistical and ethical 
intricacies of transplanting hearts from HCV -positive donors into HCV -negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], highlight the need to 
conduct a controlled study to establish safe ty and efficacy, while investigating mechanisms of HCV transmission 
and de -novo coronary vasculopathy.  
 
We expect that there will be a high degree of willingness of carefully selected, HCV -negative heart transplant 
patients to accept an organ from an HCV -positive donor, especially given the high HCV cure rates with current 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. After completing this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the goal is to then apply for federal funding to perform a multi-
center randomized controlled trial using HCV -positive hearts for HCV -negati ve recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], with the hope to 
increase utilization of organs that are currently discarded more than 97% of the time.  
 
This study will target cardiac transplant candidates that currently face challenges in receiving an HCV -negative 
transplant and have a s ubstantial probability of health decline while on the waiting list. These capture two broad 
groups of patients: 1) patients with end -stage systolic heart failure with lower probabilities of transplant, and 
higher risk of waitlist mortality; and 2) patients  with arrhythmia disorders, as these patients don’t receive the 
highest priority (status 1a) because inotropic support may lead to worsened arrhythmias and/or LVAD support  
may not ease the arrhythmic burden.   With respect to group 1, as one example, patien ts with blood group O 
have known longer waiting times and lower transplant rates —from [ADDRESS_326172] removal for death or clinical 
deteriorat ion and lower transplant rates in patients with blood group O who were “bigger”:  a) Blood group O, 
height ≥6 feet, weight <100kg: 56.8% transplanted, 17.4% died/too sick; b) Blood group O, height <6 feet, weight 
≥100kg: 43.2% transplanted, 22.2% died/too sick; c) Blood group O, height ≥6 feet, weight ≥100kg: 42.2% 
transplanted, 21.3% died/too sick; d) all other patients on waitlist: 65.3% transplanted, 14.4% died/too sick.   
 
These discrepancies are even more pronounced in certain parts of the country; for example, in UNOS region 2 
(PA, MD, WV, DE, and NJ), 41.1% -56.5% of blood group O patients who are ≥6 feet and/or ≥100kg are 
transplanted, as compared to 70.5% of all other patients on the waitlist during this time period.  
4.2. Rationale of the study  
We will perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_267829] -positive organs for HCV -negative 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], by [CONTACT_267869] [ADDRESS_326173] -transplant phase in order to cure their HCV .

11 4.3. Zepatier  
Open -label Zepatier (grazoprevir 100 mg and elbasvir 50 mg) will be administered in this study .3,4 Zepatier is a 
fixed -dose combination tablet without ribavirin. GZR  is an HCV  NS3/4a inhibitor while EBR is an HCV  NS5A  
inhibitor. Both grazoprevir and elbasvir are direct -acting antivirals, which together form an effective therapy for 
HCV  and reduce the likelihood and effects of long -term liver -related HCV  complications. GZR/EBR exhibits broad 
in vitro activity against most HCV  genotypes and in vitro act ivity against many clinically relevant RAVs .3,[ADDRESS_326174] been  carried out, which led to FDA approval for Zepatier  as a treatment for genotype 1 
and 4 HCV . 
 
As of July 1, 2015, a diverse population of over 1000 HCV  patients has been exposed to Zepatier  either as a 
single agent or in combination with ribavirin or sofosbuvir in phase I/II/III studies.  Zepatier  has been generally 
well tolerated at doses of 50 -100 mg GZR and 50 mg EBR orally once daily.  It has been comparably effective 
across all subgroups it has been tested in, including non -cirrhotic and/or treatment -naïve subjects .3,[ADDRESS_326175] Zepatier  trials, the majority  of the adverse events 
were reversible. These adverse events are usually grade 1 or 2 mild or moderate events.  
 
The dosage in our study (100/50 mg daily ) is a commonly attainable dose in clinical practice. In the event dialysis 
is needed after transplant, Zepatier has shown to be safe for subjects with chronic heart  disease or who are on 
hemodialysis. Less than 1% of Zepatier  is excreted renally. In [COMPANY_006]  C-SURFER,  a phase [ADDRESS_326176] demonstrated a 94 -100% success rate achieving HCV  RNA  levels of <15 IU /ml after 12 weeks 
of treatment ( SVR-12) among genotype [ADDRESS_326177] at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971].

13 6 CHAPTER 3: SCREENING AND SUBJECT SELECTION  
6.1. Recruitment: identification and screening process  
The trial’s phases can be categorized as “screening phase,” (when patients are consented and will undergo 
testing and evaluation for enrollment), “waiting list phase” (when patients are  enrolled and are waiting for an 
offer of transplantation) and “transplantation phase” (after a HCV -positive heart  has been received and 
transplanted.  
 
We will approach patients meeting the above criteria to receive a heart transplant from an HCV -positive donor.  
We anticipate needing to approach [ADDRESS_326182] and abdominal transplant surgeon, to ensure that 
besides the underlying cardiac disease, the patient would meet criteria for listing for liver transplantation.  Once 
patients are consented and enrolled, the heart transplant team will be made aware of the patient’s enrollment, 
and he/she will then have his/her status on UNET changed to be eligible to receive a heart  from an HCV -positive 
donor.  
 
We expect to screen [ADDRESS_326183] 100 to meet inclusio n/exclusion criteria, of whom 35  will 
consent to be screened, and 25 will remain eligible following all screening tests.  
 
Patients who are screened will be tracked in  a pre -screen ing log to facilitate the screening process.   The study 
team has worked with their department’s Information Technology Team and their recommendations for 
protecting potential subject health information  will be put into place.  
 
Subjects who are temporarily inactive and unable to receive any heart  offers until reactivated  will continue to be 
followed.  If the subject  is reactivated, his/her status  based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_093] t eam to ensure the patient is still eligible for the study.   
 
Only subjects who would be eligible for a liver transplant if HCV caused them to experience liver failure will be 
enrolled in this study. To be deemed eligible for a liver transplant at Penn, all patients (not only study subjects) 
must be examined by [CONTACT_17588] a hepatologist and a liver transplant surgeon.

Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/[ADDRESS_326185] of care, LABS will analyze specimens for the presence of HCV via 
serological testing and qualitative nucleic acid testing. If a specimen is positive for both HCV tests, it will be 
couriered to the University of Pennsylvania via a Gift -of-Life courier, only if and after the donor’s authorizing 
next- of-kin has given authorization for donation and research.  The Molecular Pathology Laboratory (MPL) at the 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971] (HUP)  will then de termine the HCV genotype(s) present in the 
specimen.  Once resulted, a printed copy will be sent to Gift -of-Life and the study investigators, and will be kept 
in the locked research file by [CONTACT_30967].  
 
The assay that will be used for HCV geno typi[INVESTIGATOR_8169] a laboratory -developed assay that was validated by [CONTACT_267871], MD, PhD . The validation process entailed testing multiple past 
clinical samples with known HCV genotypes, as well as purchased HCV genotype  controls, and assessing 
concordance  between the results obtained and the expected results.9 This assay (the eSensor® HCVg Direct  Test, 
GenMark Diagnostics) has also been validated by [CONTACT_267872]: 
Covance Central Laboratory Services (482 samples, 98.6% concordance), University of Minnesota (135 samples, 
96.4% concordance), and the University of Washington (77 samples, 97.4%).10-[ADDRESS_326186], overall, the  
assay was able to genotype all purchased controls correctly (n=15, HCV genotypes 1 through 6, concordance  = 
100%) . It was also able to correctly genotype the vast majority of prior clinical samples (n=56 of 61, HCV 
genotypes 1 through 6, concordance = 92%).  Resolution of discordant samples showed t hat th e limitations of 
the assay , as determined by [CONTACT_267873],  include d decreased abilit y to genotype samples with: low viral loads, 
mixed genotype infections, or HCV genotype 4f  infection . These limitations are felt to be minor as l ow viral load 
specimens are not expected from HCV -untreated organ donors, and mixed genotype / genotype 4f spec imens 
are very rarely encountered in the [LOCATION_002]. The validation samples were pi[INVESTIGATOR_267830] a higher proportion of mixed infection samples (n=6) and rare genotype 
samples (e.g. Type 4f, n=1)  than what is encountered clinically. A retrospective review by [CONTACT_267874] a 14 -month period (July 2014 to October 2015) by [CONTACT_267875][INVESTIGATOR_124365] (Siemens VERSANT HCV Genotype 2.0) found a total of 6 mixed  infec tions and one genotype 4f 
infection out of 1,551 samples tested (~0.4% and 0.06%, respectively ).  
6.3.2.  Drug Resistance Testing  
Participants with Genotype 1a and Genotype [ADDRESS_326187] uses reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) and D NA sequencing to detect mutations [resistance associated variants (RAVs)] in the 
NS5a inhibitors. It has not been cleared or approved by [CONTACT_267876]. The test will be performed by a lab qualified by [CONTACT_267877] . It has an analytical 
sensitivity of >95% for viral loads ≥1800 IU/mL. 13 Reported results include mutations and polymorphisms 
associated with NS5A inhibitor resistance (only if HCV genotype 1a, 1b, or 1 detected) as well as a patient 
specific interpretation:  
• Resistance predicted: ≥1 mutatio n predicting NS5A inhibitor resistance detected

18 7 CHAPTER 4: TREATMENTS  
7.1. Zepatier  (grazoprevir and elbasvir)  
Zepatier tablets will be provided by [CONTACT_267878]- initiated protocol funded by [CONTACT_44873] . Open -
label Zepatier  (grazoprevir 100 mg and elbasvir 50 mg) will be administered once daily by [CONTACT_5555] [ADDRESS_326188] po lymorphisms at positions M28, Q30, 
L31, and/or Y93  as determined by [CONTACT_267879] C Viral RNA Genotype [ADDRESS_326189]. In this case , 
treatment with Zepatier  will be extended to 16 weeks and renally -adjusted Ribavirin will be initiated at the 
clinician’s discretion , and continued for the remainder of therapy (until the 16 week mark).  Such a strategy will 
provide optimal treatment, without delaying therapy prior to receipt of results of NS5A drug resistant testing.  
Grazoprevir ( GZR)/ elbasvir ( EBR) is a fixed -dose combination tablet without ribavirin.  
 
GZR is an HCV  ns3/4a inhibitor while EBR is an HCV  NS5A  inhibitor. Both are direct -acting antivirals, which 
together form an effective therapy for HCV  virus and reduce the likelihood and effects of long -term liver -related 
HCV  complications. GZR/EBR exhibits broad in vitro activity against most HCV  genotypes and in vitro activity 
against many clinically relevant  resistance -associated variants (RAVs).   
 
Zepatier  (GZR/EBR) has been evaluated globally in multiple phase I, II, and III trials to treat HCV . Randomized, 
placebo -controlled trials have been completed and led to obtain FDA approval for Zepatier  as a treatment for 
genotype 1 and 4 HCV . As of July 1,  2015, a diverse population of over 1000 HCV  patients has been exposed to 
Zepatier either as a single agent or  in combination with ribavirin or sofosbuvir in phase I/II/III studies.  Zepatier 
has been generally well tolerated at doses of 50 -100 mg GZR and 50 mg EBR orally once daily.  It has been 
comparably effective across all subgroups it has been tested in, including non -cirrhotic and/or treatment- naïve 
subjects.  
 
Headaches, fatigue, and nausea represent the most common adverse drug reactions with Z epatier . Other drug-
related adverse events have included arthralgia, insomnia, diarrhea, dizziness, pyrexia, and asthenia. Drug -
related serious adverse events are uncommon, but include allergic reactions, possible adverse interactions with 
other medication s, or elevated liver enzymes. In past Zepatier  trials, the majority of the adverse events were 
reversible. These adverse events are usually grade 1 or 2 mild or moderate events.  
 
The dosage in our study (100/50 mg qd) is a commonly attainable dose in clin ical practice. In the event dialysis is 
needed after transplant, Zepatier has shown to be safe for subjects with chronic  kidney disease or who are on 
hemodialysis. Less than 1% of Zepatier  is excreted renally. In [COMPANY_006]  C-SURFER , a phase [ADDRESS_326190] demonstrated a 94 -100% success rate achieving HCV  RNA  levels of <15 IU /ml after 12 wee ks 
of treatment ( SVR-12) among genotype [ADDRESS_326191] -line therapy, rather than other approved 
agents (i.e., Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir, trade name [CONTACT_267898]), as Zepatier  has been shown to be safe and efficaciou s 
in patient with significant renal dysfunction. As a result, if a subject’s heart  function has not fully recovered 
when treatment is initiated, the investigational agents can safely be administered, unlike other approved agents.   
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/2018 
19 7.1.1.  Administration of study m edication  
[COMPANY_006] & Co  will manufacture , package, and label Zepatier  drug. There will be one bottle per subject containing a 
28-day supply (28 capsules ) of 100/50 mg Zepatier  tablets .   Daily dose will be one tablet .   
 
The Investigational Drug Services  (IDS)  pharmacy, directed by [CONTACT_267880] , PharmD , will only be required 
to store and distribute  the study drug. Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin will be purchased and sourced locally.  Both of 
these medications will be purchased and stored by  [CONTACT_267881]. Ribavirin will be generic and the 
manufacturer will vary depending on monthly price fluctuations.   
 
Zepatier will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_267831] ( IDS) pharmacy by [CONTACT_52903] 28 -day 
intervals. The study staff will de liver the medication to the subjects  at their study visits (patients expected to be 
at home by [CONTACT_267882] -
transplant/study visit) . Treatment with the study drug will begin  within  [ADDRESS_326192] has received  Zepatier , he or she will be treated with a second regimen that includes 
Zepatier plus Sovaldi (Sofosbuvir) and Ribavirin.   Any patient (male or female) receiving ribavirin as part of the 
first- or second -line regimen will be required to use two methods of birth control while on Ribavirin therapy, 
with continuing two forms of birth control for up to [ADDRESS_326193] baseline NS5A drug resistance assay testing that demonstrates polymorphisms  at positions M28, 
Q30, L31, and/or Y93, treatment with Zepatier will be extended to 16 weeks, rather than 12 weeks, and renally -
adjusted Ribavirin at the clinician’s discretion will be initiated, and continued for the remainder of therapy (until 
the 16 week mark).  Such a strategy will provide optimal treatment, without delaying therapy prior to receipt of 
results of NS5A drug resistant testing.  
 
7.1.2.  Drug logistics and accountability  
Study medication bottles must be stored at controlled  temperature of 20 °C  to 25 °C (68°F  to 77 °F); excursions 
permitted between 15°C to 30°C (between 59°F to 86°F)  in a locked, secure area.  Study drug must be protected 
from moisture.  The research staff or investigator will instruct the subject on the proper administration of 
Zepatier.  Zepatier tablets should be taken once daily by [CONTACT_1966].   The investigator, or a responsible party 
designated by [CONTACT_093], must maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of the 
investigational agent using the drug accountab ility form.  If a subject loses the bottle of study medication, the 
research staff should contact [CONTACT_267880] , Pharm acist  at the research pharmacy. A replacement bottle 
with the appropriate amount of study medication will be made available at the research pharmacy.  
7.1.3.  Destruction and return  
At the conclusion of the study, remaining medication from the study patients (and left -over medication) will be 
destroyed at the clinical site, after approval is gran ted by [CONTACT_267883] n plan. 
Destruction will be documented in the drug accountability form.  
7.1.4.  Zepatier  Initial Treatment Failures  
Study subjects with treatment failure, defined as virologic breakthrough (when an undetectable viral load while 
on treatment becomes detectable or a >= one log increase from nadir HCV RNA ) or virologic relapse 
(undetectable viral load after completion of treatment that during the [ADDRESS_326194]- treatment follow -up period 
becomes detectable) will be provided open -label Zepatier  + Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) 400 mg + Ribavirin  (generic), 
renally dosed based on creatinine clearance per the manufacturer guidelines . Any subjects who experience 
treatment failure will repeat  the original study lab visit and visit protocol  once they begin their secondary 
treatment with  Zepatier , sofosbuvir, and ribavirin , similar to subjects initiating HCV treatment following heart

21 8 CHAPTER 5: DATA COLLECTION  
8.1. Stud y visits  
Study visits are scheduled to occur following subjects’ standard post -transplant follow -up visits. Since treating 
cardiologist s do not always require stable post -transplant patients to attend these visits, subjects may be asked 
to come in solely for study visits. These visits will be encouraged, but not required unless the study drug is being 
dispensed that day. For all other study visits, a missed visit by a stable subject who has had necessary labs drawn 
will not be considered a protocol violatio n.  
8.1.1.  Informed consent  
During the screening phase, p otentially eligible , interested  subjects will be invited to attend an informational 
session. The following procedures will be performed during the screening process:  
• Sign and date the ICF and HIPAA authorization  
• Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Schedule for screening visit  
 
After completing the informational session and signing the informed consent, the subject will be scheduled for a 
screening visit within [ADDRESS_326196] meets inclusion/exclusion criteria thus far.  The study staff will call 
the subject 1 -2 days prio r to the screening visit and send a reminder letter as well if the screening visit is not 
conducted within the 2 weeks following consent.  
8.1.2.  Screening  
The following procedures  and activities  will be performed during the screening process , after the informed 
consent is signed : 
• Review medical history  
• Vital signs  
• Physical exam  
• Review current medications  
• Labs/phlebotomy: hepatic function panel, HCV  RNA , HBV  DNA , and HIV  antibody  
o HBV Core Antibody will be checked in patients during screening, if not checked previo usly.  
• Serum chg. pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential)  
• Completio n of health status questionnaire (RAND -36) 
• Provide instructions on recording of new medications and dose changes  
8.1.3.  Post -Heart Transplant  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Post -Heart Transplant Visits  
Patients, after receiving a heart  transplant are followed very closely by [CONTACT_267884].  
As apart of standard of care visits, the following procedures activities will be performed:  
• Phlebotomy  
• Vital signs  
• Physical exam  
 
The study staff will f ollow procedures and activities closely along with transplant team and this information (vital 
signs, physical exam, and phlebotomy results) will be collected as apart of data collection.  In addition to these  
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/[ADDRESS_326197] of care procedures and activities, the  study team will also perform specific research related activities at 
specific time points.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Post -Heart Transplant Research Phlebotomy  
Research laboratory blood draws will take place along with standard of care blood draws outlined in Section 
8.2.1. The st udy staff will call the research subject to coordinate research blood draws appropriately. In addition, 
study staff will assess for adverse events/side effects  and obtain current medication data.  
 
As outlined in Section 8.2.1, patients with a positive HBV  Core Antibody, HBV -DNA levels will be checked every 6 
weeks while on Zepatier and LFTs will be closely  monitored . HBV therapy may  be considered the transplant 
team as medically appropriate.  
 
Additional laboratory testing will be done if the PIs feel it is  necessary for patient safety.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Visit 1: Post-Heart  Transplant  (day 3  ± 1) 
The study  staff will meet the subject in their HUP  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223] , three days after their heart  transplant.  
 
Initiating treatment with Zepatier  
Treatment with the study drug will begin when the patient has a detectable and quantifiable HC V RNA post -
transplantation . All subjects will be provided with a [ADDRESS_326198]’s primary cardiologist  and primary care 
physician.  
 
As with any scientific protocol, safety will be considered before treating the patients. The treating physician will 
evaluate the patient’s overall condition and make a judgment on whether initiating treatment is safe . 
 
The following research procedures and activities will be performed:  
• Assess for Adverse Events  
• Obtain medication data  
• Research Phlebotomy , including the NS5A drug resistance assay testing  (See Section 8.2.[ADDRESS_326199]) 
• Dispense study drugs  
 
Blood samples for immunologic t -cell assays will be processed and banked or shipped .  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Management of patients with NS5A resistance variants  
Once HCV infection is confirmed, patients will have their HCV genotype reconfirmed. P atients with Genotype 1a 
and Genotype [ADDRESS_326200] polymorphisms at positions M28, Q30, L31, and/or Y93, 
treatment with Zepatier will b e extended to 16 weeks, rather than 12 weeks, and renally -adjusted Ribavirin at 
the clinician’s discretion will be initiated, and continued for the remainder of therapy (until the 16 week mark).  
Such a strategy will provide optimal treatment, without delaying therapy prior to receipt of results of NS5A drug 
resistant testing.  Under such a scenario, all of the study procedures referenced above and below will be 
extended by 4 weeks. Any patient (male or female) receiving ribavirin as part of the first - or second -line regimen 
will be required to use two methods of birth control while on Ribavirin therapy, with continuing two forms of 
birth control for up to [ADDRESS_326201] dose of the study drug.

23 [IP_ADDRESS].2.  Management of patients with positive HBV Core Antibody  
For patients with a positive HBV Core Antibody, HBV -DNA levels will be checked every 6 weeks while on Zepatier 
and LFTs will be closely  monitored . HBV therapy may  be considered the transplant team as medically 
appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Visit 2:  Post-Heart  Transplant  (day 10  ± 2 day)

• Schedule appointments  for the follow -up visits  
 
HCV Non -Transmission  
It is possible that a subject may not develop chronic HCV infection, either due to non -transmission or 
spontaneous clearance of HCV by [CONTACT_5875] 4 (defined as an initial positive HCV RNA and subsequent undetectabl e 
HCV RNA without treatment) .  If a subject has an undetectable HCV RNA based on the week 4 HCV RNA, a repeat 
HCV RNA will be checked at week 8 to ensure non -infection with HCV, rather than a false -negative HCV RNA.  If 
the week 8 HCV RNA confirms lack of infection (undetectable week 8 HCV RNA), then no further treatment will 
be needed . Subjects will be assessed at a study visit and HCV RNA levels re -checked at week [ADDRESS_326209] them in order to meet our planned treatment sample size.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Visits 5 -7: Post-Heart T ransplant (day 42± 7, day 56± 7, day 70±7)

Additional visits  will only be necessary in the case of treatment failures . If treatment failure occurs , subjects will 
be treated with  Zepatier and two other hepatitis C medication s, Sofosbuvir  (Sovaldi), and Ribavirin  for an 
additional 12 weeks. All study and lab visits will be repeated during this secondary treatment period.  NS5A 
resistance (RAV) testing will be checked again (a second time) prior to initiating second -line therap y. 
8.1.4.  Future research 
Subjects will also be approached to provide optional blood sample for testing of viral kinetics (HCV RNA), donor 
and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267836] -28B polymorphisms , and alloimmune responses (T - and B -cell function).  Samples will be stored 
in a locked freezer, using encrypted patient IDs.   
 
De-identified samples from subjects may be sent to other investigators for their research. These samples may 
include information such as sex, age, health history, or ethnicity. These samples will not be sold. Some fu ture 
studies may need health information (such as smoking history or present health status) that may require 
contact[CONTACT_267885].

8.3. Subject retention and drug adherence  
We will enforce subject retention in several ways. We will record extensive contact [CONTACT_267886]. This will include home, work, and cellular telephone numbers. The research staff 
will call before each study visit to remind the subject to attend.   We will also obtain contact [CONTACT_21115] a 
family member or friend so that we can contact [CONTACT_12552]/her if the subject does not answe r his/her regular phone 
number.  
An adequate record of receipt, distribution, and return  of all study drugs must be kept.  Subject adherence  with 
the treatment and protocol includes willingness to comply with all aspects of the protocol, and to have blood 
collected for all safety evaluations.   
The research staff and physician will explain the  importance of adherence  with the study protocol at each 
subject contact. If a subject fails to comply with a study visit, the staff  will contact [CONTACT_267887]. If 
this fails, the staff  will send two certified express letters one week apart, to r equest follow- up. 
We have considered how to minimize non -adherence  with therapy. We will strongly emphasize the importance 
of complying with the study drug treatment. Nonetheless, we will perform pi[INVESTIGATOR_267838]. If a subject has a serious adverse event (SAE) (whether 
related to study drugs or not), we will continue to follow -up with the subject for study assessments to assist with 
safety monitoring and to avoid the problems introduced by [CONTACT_11368]. The inclusion of such follow -up data

31 9 CHAPTER 6: ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY AND OUTCOME MEASURES  
9.1. Assessments of Efficacy  
The p rimary aims of the study are to determine sustained virologic response rates (SVR) of open -label Zepatier 
administered to HCV -negative patients with heart failure  who receive a heart  transplant from a genotype [ADDRESS_326232] -transplant de -novo HCV  infection.   
9.1.1.  Sustained Virologic Response (SVR)  
SVR will be based on the standard definition of SVR -12, defined as an undetectable HCV  RNA in a subject’s 
serum 12 weeks after completing treatment for HCV  ([ADDRESS_326233] dose of Zepatier).  
9.2. Secondary Outcome Measures  
• To determine safety of administering Zepatier  to heart  transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267839] -
negative, but developed de -novo HCV  after receiving a heart  transplant from an HCV -positive donor  
• To determine 1 -year graft survival rates of HCV -negative heart  transplant patients who receive a heart  
transplant from a genotype 1 or 4 HCV -positive donor, including those who spontaneously clear HCV  
and those who receive open -label Zepatier  upon developm ent of de -novo HCV . 
• To evaluate rates of spontaneous clearance of HCV  among HCV -negative patients who receive a heart  
transplant from a genotype [ADDRESS_326234] safety and adverse events will be based in CTCAE Version 4 criteria, listed in Section 13, and will include 
adverse events and serious adverse events, related both to receipt of a heart  transplant from an HCV -positive 
donor among HCV -negative subjects with heart failure , and adverse events related to administration of Zepatier.  
9.2.2.  Graft Survival  
Graft survival will be based on standardize United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) criteria, with a graft failure 
defined as subject death,  or re-transplantation   within the first year post -transplantation.  
9.2.3.  Spontaneous Clearance or Non -Transmission of HCV  
Spontaneous clearance  or non -transmission  of HCV  will be based on an undetectable HCV  RNA level at post -
transplant weeks [ADDRESS_326235] who experiences spontaneous clearance of 
HCV or non -transmission of HCV will still be tested for HCV RNA at week s 8, 16, and 28, to ensure that their 
levels are still undetectable .  
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/2018 
32 10 CHAPTER 7: STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1. Study Design  
This open -label trial involves one primary and several secondary objectives.  Post -transplant HCV status will be 
monitored, and patients will be treated with 12 -16 weeks of Zepatier  therapy , after which time, treatment will 
be comp lete, barring instances of treatment failure, which would require an additional 12 weeks of therapy .*   
10.2. Disposition of Subjects and Baseline Comparisons  
Summaries of all subjects screened, recruited, and enrolled will be provided, according to the CONSORT 
guidelines. The treatment groups will be evaluated at baseline with respect to demographics and baseline 
measurements related to efficacy and safety without formal statistical testing.  
10.3. Analyses of Outcome Measures  
The primary analysis will evaluate SVR -[ADDRESS_326236] to 
follow -up, we will use all of the information available until the end of follow -up. Subjects who withdraw consent 
will no longer be followed  in this protocol .  Patients will receive care from the patients’ c linicians . 
 
For patients lost to follow -up, we will use all the information available up to the time of loss to follow -up. For 
the primary end point, we will perform an analysis of completers only. We will also perform additional sensitivity 
analyses using  imputation to assess the impact of missing data for the primary and secondary end points.  
10.5. Protocol Violations  
Serious protocol deviations  such as discontinuation of experimental treatment unrelated to adverse events (AEs) 
will be carefully recorded and re gularly reviewed by [CONTACT_3252] -Principal Investigator s. Remedial changes in procedure 
will be recommended where feasible to reduce the incidence of such  deviations . The causes and circumstances 
of all violations will be documented where known for purposes of futur e secondary analyses and interpretation. 
Because all primary analyses will be intent -to-treat, it is essential that violations be kept to a minimum, 
especially where it is possible to influence their rate of occurrence.  A missed study visit will not be con sidered a 
protocol violation unless the study drug was scheduled to be dispensed at the visit, the subject did not have 
necessary labs done, or the subject has not been stable.  
10.6. Safety Analysis  
All patients will be assessed for toxicity and included in the  safety analysis. This analysis will include summaries 
of the incidence and grade of toxicities. Safety interim analyses will be performed  at days 14, 30, 60, 90, 118, 
and 184,  and will be  reported at each DSMB meeting.  SAEs will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_4318]. .

33 11 CHAPTER 8: QUALITY CONTROL AND DATA HANDLING  
 
11.1. Personnel Training  
Prior to enrolling the first subject in the study protocol, the Principal Investigators  will ensure that the 
Investigator staff has completed appropriate training and that all documentation including IRB approval is 
completed and available. The purpose of training is to ensure that study personnel are carrying out the protocol 
in a consistent way and adhering to good clinical practice guidelines. Staff will have current Human Subjects  
 
Training Certification on file. Before enrollment begins, study staff who will perform the outcome assessments 
will be trained in all procedures, including completion of the REDCap database.  
 
The co-PIs and research staff will constitute the first line of monitoring of the safety of the human participants. 
Surveillance for AEs will consist of questioning subjects about potential AEs at every study contact, having 
subjects report any AE to the st udy team, and having subjects undergo vital sign checks and physical exams 
during each study visit. Laboratories will be performed at selected visits and checked.  
All study personnel are required to read the consent form, the protocol , and the  IB. 
11.2. Data Qua lity  
The co-PIs and research staff  will perform continuous monitoring of data quality and completion of CRFs. All 
consent forms and screening logs will be subject to audit by [CONTACT_3374].  Summary statistics 
from the screening logs will be sent to [COMPANY_006] quarterly or as requested. Finally, [COMPANY_006] staff reviews the 
reporting, documentation and follow -up of SAEs to assure that these events were handled according to required 
study procedures.   All data on AEs and SAEs will be made available t o the DSMB , as per the timeline outlined in 
the DSM B Charter.  
11.3. Audit and Inspection  
Inspections may be carried out by [CONTACT_209567] [i.e., FDA ] as well as the  IRB. 
11.4. Archiving  
Essential documents shall be archived safely and secu rely in such a way that ensures that they are readily 
available  upon authorities’ request.  Patient (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) files will be archived according to local regulations and in 
accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], institution or private practice.  
 
  
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/2018 
34 12 CHAPTER 9: PARTICIPANT SAFETY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
12.1. Informed Consent  
Informed Consent will be obtained for enrollment from participants. For each consent process, study personnel 
will discuss the details of the study, the risks and benefits, and the subject’s rights and responsibilities if they 
choose to participate in the trial and their right to refuse to participate.  It will be made clear that their clinical 
care will not be affected by [CONTACT_220862].  
 
Each subject will have amp le time and opportunity to ask questions and will be informed about the right to 
withdraw from the study at any time without any disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this 
decision.  
 
Only after the subject consents  voluntarily and agrees t o sign the ICF and has done so, may he/she enter the 
study.  Additionally, the investigator and other information provider (if any) will sign and date the form.  The 
subject will receive a copy of the signed and dated form.  
 
The signed informed consent sta tement is to remain in the investigator site file or  
 
If the patient is not capable of providing a signature, a verbal statement of consent can also be given in the 
presence of an impartial witness (independent of the investigator).  This is to be document ed by a signature 
[CONTACT_105953] a signature [CONTACT_23686].  
 
The ICF and any other written information provided to subjects / legal representatives or proxy consenters will 
be revised whenever important new information become s available that may be relevant to the subject’s 
consent, or there is an amendment to the protocol that necessitates a change to the content of the subject 
information and / or the written ICF.  The investigator will inform the subject / legal representat ive or proxy 
consenter of changes in a timely manner and will ask the subject to confirm his/her participation in the study by 
[CONTACT_166806].  Any revised written ICF and written information must receive the IEC/IRB’s approval in 
advance of use.  
12.2. Institutional Review Board Process  
Study staff will obtain IRB approval before any study procedures are initiated.  
 
12.3. Insurance  
The heart  transplant itself will be paid for by [CONTACT_1766]’  insurance carriers, and does not require any additional 
pre-authorizati on because of the potential to receive a heart  from a hepatitis C -positive donor.  The costs of all 
visits and tests described above will be billed to the insurance carrier, except for the blood draw for research 
purposes (which includes the hepatitis C ge notype test, which is based on a laboratory -developed test using 
materials purchased from the commercial entity that developed this test, and will be paid for by [CONTACT_17881]), and the study dru g, which will be paid for by [CONTACT_44873] . Subjects  are still responsible for any deductibles or 
applicable co -pays for routine office visits , blood work  and procedures . We do  not expect subjects  to have 
health insurance coverage/payment issues due to becoming infected with hepatitis C, per se, and the stu dy is 
designed so subjects  do not require additional study visits post -transplant, provided there are no adverse 
events.  
 
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/2018 
35 12.4. Laboratory Values  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be measured and repeated at time points specified in schedule of 
procedures (section 8.2.1) and as clinically indicated.  
12.4.1.  Chemistry  
• Hepatic function panel including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, 
total and direct bilirubin, and albumin.   
• Basic metabolic panel including BUN and creatinin e. 
12.4.2.  Serum virologic testing  
• HCV  RNA  (with Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_267840])  
• Hepatitis B surface antigen  
• HIV antibody  testing .    
• HBV Core Antibo dy (as needed)  
12.4.3.  Pregnancy Testing  
Blood and urine pregnancy tests will be performed (as appropriate) per the schedule of procedures (section 5.2).  
12.4.4.  Hepatitis C Viral Kinetics  
Each time  standard of care  laboratories are drawn, subjects may  have one additional purple -top tube drawn  
(4cc of blood) . This blood test is optional. The research coordinator will process the tube and store it in a - 80◦ 
freezer in the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine 7th Floor Gastroenterology Research Office. Each month, 
these tubes will be shipped to Abbott Pharmaceuticals so they can test for HCV antibodies, HCV core antigen, 
and HCV  RNA. These additional tests will be included in the informed consent process for all subjects. Abbott will 
perform these tests free of charge to University of Pennsylvania once both are able to reach a Material Transfer 
Agreement (MTA).  
12.4.5.  IL28B Genotype Testing  
At the time of the subject’s heart  transplant, both donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267841] 28B Genotype Testing. Donors’ families will have already agreed to this test when they consent to 
research testing. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267842].  
12.5. Zepatier Related Laboratory Abnormalities and Drug Interacti ons 
Laboratory Abnormalities  
The following laboratory abnormalities were observed in studies done with Zepatier : 
 
Late elevations in aminotransferase levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal generally occurred in around 1 -
3% of patients in previous Zepatier clinical trials; these increases were rarely associated with hyperbilirubinemia. These 
abnormalitie s were reversible and had no major clinical consequences.  
 
Effects of Zepatier  on antiretrovirals:  
• Atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100mg co -administered with MK -5172 200mg daily somewhat increased atazanavir 
exposure (AUC increased 43%, Cmax increased 12%, C24 increased 23%). Co -administration of these 
medications is not recommended.  
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/2018 
36 • Darunivir/ritonavir 600/1 00 mg co -administered with MK -5172 200 mg was not significantly altered by [CONTACT_267888]-5172 or MK -8742. However, due to DRV/r effects on Zepatier  exposure, co -administration is not 
recommended.  
• Efavirenz was not significantly impacted when co -administered w ith Zepatier , though it may negatively impact 
Zepatier exposure.  
• Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir exposures were not significantly impacted when co -administered with Zepatier . However, 
due to LPV/r effects on Zepatier  exposure, co -administration is not recommended.  
 
Effect of Antiretrovirals on Zepatier : 
• Atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100mg co -administered with MK -5172 200mg significantly increased exposure 
of MK -5172 (AUC increased 10.58- fold, Cmax increased 6.24 -fold, and C24 increased 11.6 -fold). These 
findings were similar when ATV/r was combined with 50mg MK -8742. MK -8742 AUC geometric mean 
ratio (GMR) was 4.76, probably due to ATV/r CYP3A4/Pgp inhibition and possible inhibition of OATP -
mediated disposition of MK -8742. Co -administration of these medications is not recomm ended.  
• Exposures of MK -5172 were significantly increased when MK -5172 200 mg was co -administered with 
darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg daily. MK -5172 AUC increased 7.5 -fold, Cmax increased 5.27 -fold, and 
C24 increased 8 -fold. MK -8742 exposures were also sig nificantly increased when combined with DRV/r 
600/100 mg daily. MK -8742 AUC GMR following co -administration was 1.66. This increase is likely 
caused by [CONTACT_097]3A4/Pgp inhibition by [CONTACT_267889]/r and possibly inhibition of OATP -mediated disposition of MK -
8742. For thes e reasons, co -administration of Zepatier  and DVR/r is not recommended.  
• Efavirenz 600mg co -administration with MK -5172 200 mg decreased MK -5172 AUC by 84%, most likely 
due to CYP3A4 induction. The same dose EFV combined with MK -5172 50 mg also decreased MK -8742 
AUC 54% for the same reasons. Co -administration of these medications may cause sub -therapeutic MK-
5172 exposure.  
• Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir 400/100 mg co -administered with MK -5172 200 mg significantly increased MK -5172 
exposure. MK- 5172 AUC increased 12.86- fold, Cmax increase 7.31 -fold, and C24 increased 21.7 -fold. 
When the same dose of LPV/r was administered with MK- 8742 50 mg, MK -8742 AUC GMR was 
increased to 3.71. LPV/r likely impacts MK -8742 exposures due to CYP3A4/Pgp inhibition and possible 
inhibition of OATP -mediated disposition. Co -administration of these medications is not recommended.  
 
Effect of Zepatier  on Other Drugs:  
• Rosuvastatin 10 mg co -administered with Zepatier  200/50 mg increased rosuva statin exposure. 
Rosuvastatin AUC and Cmax were increased 59% and 325% respectively when exposed to MK- 5172 
alone and 126% and 449% when exposed to the combined Zepatier  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. The most likely cause of the 
increase is pre -systemic inhibition of rosuvastatin efflux  in the liver and/or gut due to BCRP inhibition. 
Clinicians may want to avoid co -administration of Zepatier and rosuvastatin.  
• Midazolam 2 mg/mL combined with multi -dose MK -5172 200 mg daily decreased midazolam AUC to 
34%. MK -5172 is likely a weak CYP3A4 i nhibitor.  
• Multiple oral doses of rifampin did not significantly affect MK -5172 AUC, but reduced C24h by 85%. This 
decrease was presumably due to the combined effect of OATP inhibition and CYP3A4/Pgp induction by 
[CONTACT_267890]. Clinicians  should avoid co -administration of these medications until 
further data becomes available.  
 
Effect of Other Drugs on Zepatier : 
• Rosuvastatin 10 mg co -administered with Zepatier  200/50 mg did not significantly alter MK -5172/8742 
exposure. However, due to Zep atier  effects on rosuvastatin exposure, clinicians may wish to avoid co -
administration.  
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/2018 
37 • Ketoconazole  (CYP3A4 and P -gp inhibitor) approximately tripled MK -5172 AUC. In healthy male subjects 
taking 400 mg multi- dose ketoconazole, MK- 8742 AUC increased by 31% .   
• Combining MK -5172 200 mg and a single dose of 600 mg IV rifampin caused a 12.6 -fold increase in MK -
5172 AUC, compared to an 8.35- fold increase with a single dose of oral rifampin 600 mg. This is likely 
due to P -gp and OATP inhibition by [CONTACT_132313]. Clinicians should avoid co -administration of these 
medications until further data becomes available.  
12.6. Other Events  
We will not discontinue study drug for clinical events not thought to be serious drug- related AEs. For example, a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267843]. Such events could 
result in missing data for primary and secondary endpoints, comprising the integrity of the analysis. This trial 
does prohibit certain therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], thus there may be a reason  to stop study drug participation under such 
circumstances. Even if subjects are withdrawn from the study drug, outcome assessments will continue, allowing 
analysis by [CONTACT_104992] -to-treat.  
12.7. Safety and Adverse Events  
12.7.1.  Definitions  
Adverse event (AE) :  Any untoward  medical occurrence associated with the protocol procedures, whether or 
not considered product or process related.  Any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Inter -current illnesses or inj uries should be regarded as AEs.  Abnormal 
results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious AE  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment  or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_267891] (SAE):  Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is 
any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening 
• requi res or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of  major 
clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -subject 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267844].  
 
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious AEs . 
Suspected adverse reaction:  Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug/investigational product caused the adverse event. For reporting purposes, "reasonable possibility" means 
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/[ADDRESS_326237] a causal relationship between the drug/investigational product and the adverse 
event.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (ADE):  is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, or any life -
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nat ure, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application, or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects.  
12.7.2.  Classifying Adverse Events  
Severity   
The intensity of the AE is classified according to the CTCAEv4.0.14  Grade refers to the severity (intensity) of the 
AE:  
• CTCAEv4 Grade 1 : mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention is not indicated.  
• CTCAEv4 Grade 2:  moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is indicated; limiting to age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL; instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc).  
• CTCAEv4 Grade 3:  severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267845]; disabling; limiting to self -care  ADL ( self-care  ADL refers to 
bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and n ot bedridden).  
• CTCAEv4 Grade 4:  life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention is indicated.  
• CTCAEv4 Grade 5:  death due to an AE.  
 
Expectedness  
AEs must be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur or were unexpected, meaning not anticipated 
based on current knowledge found in the protocol, investigator brochure, product insert, or label.  
Expected:   an AE /ADE  known to be associated with the intervention or condition under study.  
Unexpected:   an AE /ADE  for which the nature or severity is not con sistent with information about the condition 
under study or intervention in the protocol, consent form, product brochure, or investigator brochure.  
 
OHRP defines an unexpected AE as any AE occurring in one or more subjects participating in a research 
proto col, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with either:  
1) the known or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the procedures involved in the research that are 
described in a) the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved r esearch protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB- approved informed consent document, and b) 
other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or  
2) the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) 
experiencing the AE and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the AE.  
 
Relatedness  
1) Definite: the AE /ADE  is clearly related to the research procedures  
2) Probably: the AE/ADE is likely related to the research procedures  
3) Possible: the AE/ADE may be related to the research procedures  
4) Unlikely: the AE/ADE is doubtfully related to the research procedures  
5) Unrelated: the AE/ADE is clearly not related to the research procedures  
 
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/2018 
39 For each identified AE/ADE , an entry on the AE/ADE form will be completed. Reporting procedures should be 
started immediately upon learning of a SAE /ADE . 
12.7.3.   Interpretation of Definitions  
AE Reporting Period  
The study period during which AEs must be reported is normally defined as the time of consent to the end of the 
study treatment follow- up. However, for this study,  the AE reporting period  will be divided based on the three 
phases of the study.  
 
a. Screening phase: When all screening tests have been done, we will assess for any AEs related to the 
screening tests at the time of communication with the subject about whether he/she is official eligible or 
ineligible for the study .  
Preexisting Condition:  A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A 
preexisting condition should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the 
condition worsens during the study period.  
 
b. Waitlist phase :   We will only capture AEs that are pertinent to the study. Specifically the following will be 
captured:  
1. Patient death ,  
2. Patient develops a condition that would exclude them from the study,  
3. Patient is de -listed (taken off the heart  transplant waitlist),  
4. Patient is made inactive on the transplant waitlist,  
5. Patient is transplanted with a non -HCV heart .   
In order to ascertain these events, we will review the patient’s medical record once a month , and will 
contact [CONTACT_102] (by [CONTACT_648], e -mail, or in -person) every [ADDRESS_326238] -transplant phase : All AEs will be assessed at every clinic visit when the subject  is seen by a member 
of the study team.   
 
d. Post -study: At the last scheduled visit, t he investigator will instruct each subject to report any 
subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be 
related to participation in this study.   
All unresolved AEs considered possibly, probably or definitely related to the study drug should be 
followed by [CONTACT_1374], the su bject is lost to follow -up, or the AE is 
otherwise explained.  The investigator should notify the IRB  of any death or AE occurring at any time 
after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this 
study.  The IRB will also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of 
cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated 
in this study.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  (screening, post -transplant, and post -study phases)  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of 
the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition o f an AE must also be 
recorded and documented as an AE.  
 
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  (post -transplant, and post -study phases)  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an AE if any one of the following  conditions is met:  
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/2018 
40 • The laboratory abnormality is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_24099] [INVESTIGATOR_267846] a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active managemen t; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of 
the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146706]  (post -transplant and post -study phase)  
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66301] a 
serious AE unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol, with the exception of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267847] a heart  offer and/or heart  transplant .  Any condi tion responsible for surgery should be documented as 
an AE if the condition meets the criteria for and AE.  
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an AE in the 
following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267848] a preexisting 
condition.  Surgery should not  be reported as an outcome of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was 
elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospit alization or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_238586], unless it is a 
worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].  
12.7.4.  Reporting Procedures for Unanticipated Problems , Adverse  Events , and Adverse Device Effects  
Principal investigators  should notify and local IRB, in an expedited manner, of those events related to study 
participation that are unforeseen and indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of harm. 
Rese archers should submit re ports of the following problems : 
 
Any AE /ADE  or UP (regardless of whether the event is serious or non -serious, on -site or off- site) that occurs any 
time during or after the research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_267849]:  
 
Unexpected (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately reflected in the 
protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, 
and the current IRB -approv ed informed consent document and other relevant sources of information, such as 
product labeling and package inserts.)  
AND  
Related to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research procedures” if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_53038],  the event was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_28821].)  
AND  
Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized . 
 
Additionally, all adverse events /adverse device effects shall be documented by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_19316], assessed, and

aware of the event and no later than  3 calendar days.  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_267850]:  
• Protocol name [CONTACT_114040]  
• Subject identifiers  (no PHI will be shared with the IRB, unless requested ) 
• Demographic data  
• Nature of the event

Other Reporta ble Events:  
The following events are also reportable to the IRB:  
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/2018 
43 • Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents an unexpected SAE that is rare in 
the absence of drug exposure (such as agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis).  
• Any AE tha t would cause a modification to the investigators brochure, protocol or ICF, or would prompt 
other action by [CONTACT_116628].  
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of severity 
or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to treatment than initially 
expected.  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than initially 
expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research study is of no 
therapeutic value.  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a 
research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and the 
investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint  indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be 
resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved protocol) that 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_267858], or affects the rights or 
welfare of subjects.  
 
Unanticipated Problem  Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPRSO):  Any incident, experience, or outcome 
that meets all of the following criteria:  
1) Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given a) the research procedures that are described 
in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, informed consent 
document, or investigators brochure; and b) the characteristics of the subject popul ation being studied;  
 
2) Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related to participation in the research 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the AE, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_267893] d in the research.); and  
 
3) Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
12.8. Subject Withdrawal  
A subject has the right to w ithdraw from the study entirely at any time for any reason without prejudice to 
future medical care by [CONTACT_267894]. The investigator also has the right to withdraw 
subjects from the study in the event of concurrent illness, AEs, or other reasons deemed to be in the subject’s 
best interest.  
 
Subjects must be withdrawn from the trial (treatment and procedures) for the following reasons:  
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/2018 
44 • Subject withdraws consent for study treatment and study procedures.  A subject must be removed 
from  the trial at his/her own request or at the request of his/her legally acceptable representative.  At 
any time during the trial and without giving reasons, a subject may decline to participate further. The 
subject will not suffer any disadvantage as a resu lt. 
• Subject becomes pregnant while undergoing treatment with Zepatier —therapy will be stopped as 
there are no human safety data of Zepatier  during pregnancy.  There are no adequate and well -
controlled studies with Zepatier in pregnant women. No effects on embryo -fetal development were 
observed in rats or rabbits at grazoprevir or elbasvir exposures higher than exposures in humans at 
the recommended clinical dose. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of 
human response, Zepatier shoul d be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the fetus.   Because the transmission rates of HCV from mother to fetus are very small, 
and HCV can be treated after pregnancy and delivery, therapy will not be continu ed during pregnancy. 
Patients will continue with the regularly scheduled study visits, but will not be eligible to receive 
continued Zepatier  therapy.  
• Subject develop s a condition that it is life threatening or any other significant risk as judged by [CONTACT_21422].  Patients will not receive study drug, but will continue with study visits as scheduled.  
• Zepatier is  no longer produced by [CONTACT_7904], or if a decision i s made to stop the study  patients will 
not receive study drug, but will continue with study visits as scheduled.  
 
Any subject removed from the trial will remain under medical supervision until discharge or transfer is medically 
acceptable.  
 
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the CRF and in the subject's medical records.  
 
In order to preserve the integrity of the intention -to-treat analysis, even if the subject is withdrawn from the 
treatment portion of the protocol (either due to s ubject, physician, or investigator decision), it is imperative to 
continue with the scheduled follow -up assessments both for the safety of the subject and for completeness of 
data collection. This will be explained to potential subjects at the time of info rmed consent. The importance of 
adherence  with study visits will be reinforced throughout the trial. If the treatment is permanently withdrawn, 
the subject will return to the center for safety assessment (history, physical examination, and clinic al 
laborat ories, if necessary).  
12.9. Confidentiality of Study Data  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject 
authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The ri ghts of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the 
ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have 
revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least 
vital status (i.e., that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/[ADDRESS_326240]’s statement 
of informed consent, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the 
appropriate individual.  
 
12.10.   Potential Risks  
12.10.1.  Risks of Study Procedures  
There are several areas of potential risk in this study.  We will obtain several blood samples from each subject. 
There is a risk of bruising, hematoma, and infection after phlebotomy, which are possible but not  considered 
serious AEs. Fainting may occur, which is unlikely but considered a serious AE. The removal of <[ADDRESS_326241]- transplant period is a potential risk; however this amount is routinely 
taken from subjects f or clinical indications without adverse effect. Study medications will be delayed until after 
phlebotomy on each study day.  
 
Because we may store subjects’ blood samples, there may be confidentiality risks associated with the storage 
and analysis of those  samples or the information resulting from the analysis of those  samples. Samples may be 
used for genetic testing. Under some circumstances, it can be a risk for genetic information to be known. To help 
ensure confidentiality, samples will be coded and stor ed in a secured facility. While situations cannot be 
foreseen where potentially sensitive genetic information is revealed or where people who should not have this 
information could obtain it (representing a loss of confidentiality), however, it is possible  that presently 
unforeseen situations may arise where this could happen.  
 
The risk of undergoing screening includes potential identification of new health problems that subjects were 
unaware of.  If we discover new health problems, we will answer subjects’ questions and try to arrange 
appropriate treatment if any is needed. If new health problems are discovered, it is possible that subjects  would 
not be able to enter this stu dy. It is also possible that subjects  would no longer be eligible for heart  
transplantation based on the results.  
 
The risks of heart  transplant surgery include blood loss, infections, and deep vein thrombosis.  There are also 
risks related to immunosuppression and standard anti -infective therapy.  
 
The risks of any transplant include primary graft non -function, delayed graft function, acute rejection, and 
death.  Re-admissions within 30 days after a heart  transplant are expected in approximately 40% of patients.  
 
There may also be a small risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_267859] (FSGS) after receiving a 
heart  from a HCV positive donor.  However, this condition can also develop in patients who do not have HCV. 
After transplant, we will monitor all patients for FSGS and similar conditions.  
12.10.2.  Risk of Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_267860] a risk of failure of the  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_267861] . However, the risk to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267862], in this event, is that they would not  receive the transplant . Hence, the related risk is losing the 
opportunity to use  the organ.  Failure of the LDT could be due to an instrument or cartridge failure or issues with 
the sample ( e.g., the sample contains a very low level of virus).  To minimize the study impact of a failed 
cartridge , the HUP Molecular Pathology Laboratory  will run the study sa mples in duplicate  due to  there not 
being enough time to repeat the test ( as would be done with  a sample  in clinical care) .  The duplicate sample 
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/[ADDRESS_326242] genotype . The risk to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267863], in 
this event, is that they  receive the  transplant , but are possibly unable to be adequately treated for HCV 
positivity. Failure of the LDT to give an accurate genotype could be due to a mixed infection (e.g. genotype 1 and 
2) or HCV genotype 4f infection in the donor sample .   
12.10.3.  Risk of NS5a Drug Resistance T est Failure  
The potential risks of the NS5a resistance testing are false negative  and false positive test results. The risk of a 
false negative test result would be if the test does not report any one of the four pertinent polymorphisms, even 
though they are present ( the presence of which  would be rare) . In this case, the patient would receive  only 12 
weeks of Zepatier (rather than 16 weeks of Zepatier + renal- dosed Ribavirin), and  potentially  fail first -line 
therapy , requir ing second -line therapy.   
 
A false positive result is less likely to happen than a false negative result. The risk of a false positive test result 
would be if the test reports a polymorphism  when the subject does not have one. Hence, the subject would be 
exposed to Zepatier for 4 weeks longer than needed as well as Ribavirin , and potentially experiencing the 
products’ side effects .  
12.10.4.  Risk of Study Drugs  
Zepatier  
In subjects receiving Zepatier  for [ADDRESS_326243] commonly reported adverse reactions of all  intensity 
(greater than or equal to 5% in placebo -controlled trials) were fatigue, headache, and nausea. In subjects 
receiving Zepatier  with ribavirin for [ADDRESS_326244] commonly reported adverse reactions of moderate or 
severe intensity (greater than  or equal to 5%) were anemia and headache.  15-17The greatest risk is failure to 
achieve SVR12 after treatment with Zepatier , leading to chronic HCV . 
 
There is a risk of fetal harm and birth defects should any woman taking Zepatier become pregnant while on the 
drug.15-17 Due to the age of the participants, this is a small risk, as all will be over 40 and unlikely to become 
pregnant. Howeve r, to mitigate this risk, all pre -menopausal women with a uterus will be screened for 
pregnancy before enrollment and instructed to use a highly effective form of birth control (e.g. abstinence, 
intrauterine device, etc.). Highly effective forms of birth c ontrol will be defined by [CONTACT_267895] (REMS) , a standard protocol used for post -transplant patients at Penn being 
treated with Mycophenolate.  
 
Sovaldi (Sofosbuvir)  
The most common adverse events (incidence greater than or equal to 20%, all grades) observed with Sovaldi in 
combination with ribavirin were fatigue and headache. The most common adverse events observed with Sovaldi 
in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin were fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia and anemia.[ADDRESS_326245] been 
demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin. Therefore, ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in 
women who are pregnant and in the male partn ers of women who are pregnant.19  
Transplanting HCV Heart s into HCV Negative Heart  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267827] V. 2.5 02/06/2018 
47 12.10.5.  Risks of Developi[INVESTIGATOR_267864] a 
liver transplant. HCV  may also cause a severe type of acute infection called fibros ing cholestatic HCV , that can 
cause severe liver injury, jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin), and progressive liver dysfunction.  
 
There is a small risk of transmission of HCV from the study subject to intimate partners during sexual activity. 
This risk is very low and should be reduced even further due to requirements for subjects to use barrier 
protection during sexual activity.  
12.11.  Potential Benefits  
The results from the study could be applied in the future to subjects (including those in the study) who stand to 
benefit from the information. Subjects will experience clinical benefits as their heart  function and quality of life 
should vastly improve fol lowing transplant. The study involves the risks of phlebotomy, development of chronic 
HCV , and loss of confidentiality, but there is a potential for future benefit for both subjects in the study and for 
future subjects, the risk/benefit ratio is favorable.  
12.12.  Alternatives  
The use of the medications for this study requires that certain other medications not be used. Therefore, the 
alternative is to not participate in this study and to continue having the option to take these medications.  
12.13.  Ethical Considerations  
The main ethical considerations in this trial are non -maleficence, respect for persons, and autonomy. Our 
selection criteria are designed to select subjects who are at substantial risk of death and health complications 
because of heart failure . Transplanta tion with a HCV -positive heart  and then treatment for HCV also involve 
risks, but it is plausible that survival and quality of life will still improve after transplantation compared to the 
alternative of remaining on the list .  Our informed consent procedu res are designed to enable individuals to 
make decisions that are consistent with their values. We will enumerate the many possible risks and plausible 
benefits. The processes of informed consent in this study will be conducted so that patients can ask que stions, 
confer with their primary cardiologist s and develop a full understanding of the trial procedures and risks, all of 
which is consistent with respect for persons. Lastly, subjects in the trial will retain the ability to consider organ 
offers and decide whether to accept an organ based on their own judgment about the value of that particular 
organ and after getting advice from their transplant team.

48 13 CHAPTER 11: GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE  
This study is to be conducted accordance with applicable US governm ent regulations and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice , Univ ersity  of Pennsylvania requirements , and applicable institutional 
research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to the FDA and a properly con stituted IRB in agreement 
with local legal prescriptions for formal approval of the study conduct.  The principal investigators will not 
commence the study until the IRB has issued written approval to the PIs.  
 
All subjects for this study will be provided  a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient 
information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study. This consent form 
will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_267896] s tudy.  The formal consent of a

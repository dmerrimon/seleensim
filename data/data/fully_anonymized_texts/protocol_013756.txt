 Dementia Caregiver Chronic Grief Management: A Live Online Video Intervention 
(CGMI-V)
A randomized, longitudinal 144-subject clinical trial of a live online, group-based video
intervention addressing dementia caregivers’ chronic grief management within the first two 
years post long-term care placement of a family member with dementia.
Objectives 
The primary objective of this Stage I clinical trial is to determine whether the 8-week 
CGMI-V has an effect on dementia family caregivers’ chronic grief. Secondary 
objectives are to determine whether the CGMI-V has an effect on dementia family 
caregivers’: (1) symptoms of depression and anxiety, (2) positive states of mind, (3) 
satisfaction with care provided in the long-term care facility and (4) conflict with staff. In addition, we will explore mechanisms of intervention impact on caregiver outcomes.
Design and Outcomes  
The study is a Stage I longitudinal randomized clinical trial to test the effects if the 
CGMI-V on caregivers’ chronic grief, mental health (symptoms of depression and anxiety; positive states of mind) and facility-related (satisfaction with care and conflict with facility staff) outcomes. 144 Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia (ADRD) caregivers whose family members are in long-term care facilities will be randomly assigned to either CGMI-V or a Minimal Treatment (MT) control condition. For both conditions, data will be collected at baseline (pre-intervention), 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention) for intervention effects, and [ADDRESS_1234985] family caregivers will be randomized to either CGMI-V condition 
(N = 72) or Minimal Treatment (MT) (N = 72). Caregivers will be males and females of any race or ethnic background, [ADDRESS_1234986] been residing in long-term care for under one year.ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/2020

2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus
In 2017, an estimated 16 million family caregivers provided approximately 18.4 billion 
hours of unpaid care to relatives with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD), valued at US $232.1 billion.
1 As the disease progresses, close to 75% of persons with 
ADRD are eventually being placed in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), where they reside for on average 2 years prior to death. The caregiving process from home care through long-term placement spans on average 5 to 10 years, which comes with a high price for caregivers’ physical and mental health.
[ADDRESS_1234989] family caregivers was up to 40%, a much higher level compared to ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/[ADDRESS_1234990] 
caregiving resulted in an estimated US$[ADDRESS_1234991] family caregivers experience 
new feelings of loss, guilt, and role captivity (e.g., feeling trapped in the caregiver role).3 
These feelings can exacerbate caregivers’ ongoing symptoms of chronic grief, depression, and anxiety, and place them at increased risk for suicide.
3-[ADDRESS_1234992] family caregivers’ reactions to loss and grief. In general, grief is considered a normal reaction to loss (i.e., loss of loved one, relationship, role, status). However, in ADRD caregiving, grief often becomes chronic because losses accumulate over time.
10,15-[ADDRESS_1234993] are in long-term care.
18 Further, Givens and colleagues19 found that caregivers with high grief levels prior 
to the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s death had even higher levels of grief seven months post death. Thus, it is essential not to wait and to treat grief prior to the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s death. Meuser and colleagues

depressive symptoms, stress, and burden. These grief-related findings laid the foundation for a paradigmatic shift from the Stress Process model

23 ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/[ADDRESS_1234997] been too short for caregivers to process 
their grief. A longer grief intervention (5 months) was used by [CONTACT_127761].[ADDRESS_1234998] caregiver’s chronic grief after LTC placement based on a grief-centered paradigm that expands the existing Stress Process Model.
 
We designed the Chronic Grief Management Intervention (CGMI)  for ADRD 
Caregivers (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_882706], O.; Co-Is Farran, C.J., & Fogg, L). Funding: NINR-R21NR010577, 2008-2011.
25,26 as a 12-week group intervention to improve caregivers’ (1) knowledge of 
late-stage ADRD; (2) communication, conflict resolution, and chronic grief management skills; and (3) grief and mental health outcomes. We pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-tested the effects of CGMI in a pre-test/multiple post-test design with random assignment of 16 long-term care facilities to either the 12-week CGMI or an attention control condition. Data were collected at baseline, 3 months (immediately post-intervention) and 6 months (post-baseline). The content was structured into three major components: (1) knowledge about late-stage ADRD, (2) communication and conflict resolution skills, and (3) chronic-grief-management skills. Those in the attention control condition received two brief minimal-support phone calls at weeks 6 and 18.  
Results: Of the total [ADDRESS_1234999] caregivers were screened, 
and 93 were eligible and enrolled ( n = 37 in CGMI; n = 56 in control). The average 
caregiver age was 60.69 (SD 10.64), while the average age for the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_154254] 83.38 (SD 6.46). The caregivers were predominately Caucasian (87%). Caregivers and care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_882707] (88%, 74% respectively). Approximately two-thirds of caregivers were adult children. The average time since care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ placement in long-term care was 7.10 months (SD 6.80).
26 Overall retention was 89% ( n = 34 in CGMI; 
n = 49 in control). Reasons for dropout were death of the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], caregiver medical 
problems, and lack of time. A total of [ADDRESS_1235000] groups of caregivers received the CGMI. Attendance averaged 10.44 sessions out of 12 (SD 1.50, R 5-12). At 3 months, we found significant improvement in the intervention group in heartfelt sadness and longing ( p = 
.027) and promising effect sizes (ES) in the intervention group scores with a decrease in 
heartfelt sadness and longing (0.49), loss of relationship (0.33), and guilt (0.29). At the 6-month follow-up, we found a significant drop in guilt ( p = .029) in the intervention group ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/2020
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 6and sustained ES in caregivers’ scores on heartfelt sadness and longing (0.38), loss of 
relationship (0.30), and guilt (0.49). At the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, caregivers reported feeling highly satisfied with the information learned in the group discussions (92%) and with the interventionists’ approach (100%). A number of caregivers suggested that there be fewer sessions due to the burden of time. Further, key staff informants (directors of nursing, unit managers, and administrators) at all 16 long-term care facilities (LTCFs) reported back to recruiters that there were caregivers who expressed interest in the intervention but were constrained due to distance and travel to attend weekly meetings at the facilities. 
Relevance for the proposed study: CGMI results supported feasibility for recruitment, 
retention, and attendance. Retention for the CGMI condition was more than 90%. Increase 
in caregiver knowledge, improvement in heartfelt sadness and longing, and decrease in guilt at [ADDRESS_1235001], we reduced the 12 weeks of 
intervention delivery to 8 weeks, maintaining the content in core target areas of the intervention as follows: (1) we condensed the content on knowledge to that most relevant to late-stage ADRD from three to two sessions, (2) we condensed the content on communication/conflict resolution skill and hands-on care to the most relevant LTC situations from three to two sessions, and (3) we maintained the focus on grief processing and grief management skills in a  more condensed format from six to four sessions. Second, the intervention was adapted to be delivered via a professionally led, live-
streaming video, online group format to accommodate distance participation.

2016-2017)
27. The purposes of this study were: (1) to determine the feasibility 
(recruitment, retention, attendance) of delivering the adapted 8-week CGMI-V in a professionally led, live-streaming video online group format and (2) to explore ADRD caregivers’ group experience using online video-based technology. Methods: This was a 
single-group study with data collection at baseline (caregiver/care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_118267]) and at 8 weeks (caregiver brief survey and focus group). Prior to intervention implementation, each caregiver received a study-provided iPad with a password-protected link to Adobe Connect. Individual orientation training in the use of the software and equipment was provided by a technology assistant. The manualized intervention was delivered over 8 weeks in 60-minute real-time, online video sessions by [CONTACT_978]. The technology assistant was present either in-person or remotely at each session to provide ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/[ADDRESS_1235002] intervention, participants completed a 5-item survey and rated on a scale from 0 = not at all  to 4 = very 
much  how much they learned from the intervention content (knowledge, communication 
and conflict resolution skills, grief management skills) and the extent of their use of the new knowledge and skills. In addition, a post-intervention focus group that was taped and transcribed covered: (1) participants’ experience with the technology (ease of use, technical problems, and orientation to online platform and iPad devices) and (2) participants’ experience with the live-streaming video online group format (ability to relate to each other emotionally, the group’s effect on emotional outcomes). 
Results: Five ADRD family caregivers responded to a notice placed in a LTCF newsletter. 
The four female and one male caregivers were all Caucasian, and so were their care 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Only one caregiver was older than [ADDRESS_1235003]-intervention focus group, caregivers ( n = 5) reported no major problems with navigating the WebEx 
platform and the iPad technology. They found the individualized orientation and ongoing support by [CONTACT_882748]. The most frequent technological problem was an echo, which was addressed at the beginning of each session by [CONTACT_882749]'s study-provided headset and iPad volume and microphone levels. Frozen images occasionally became a problem when caregivers were traveling, due to weaker local Wi-Fi capacity. However, those caregivers were able to continue the session without interruption using the audio function. Importantly, caregivers reported that the online environment did not interfere with their ability to relate to each other emotionally, especially because they could see each other via WebEx live-streaming video. Participants indicated that the group size was ideal for the online group interaction and thought that a group larger than [ADDRESS_1235004]-intervention survey results: the highest agreement rate between participants was that the group discussions helped them process their loss and grief associated with long-term care placement 3.6/4 (0.55)

Relevance for the proposed study: this pi[INVESTIGATOR_882708]-based online delivery of the CGMI-V in a professionally 
led, synchronous video format. ADRD caregivers reported no major technological difficulties and were able to relate to each other in an online environment.ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/[ADDRESS_1235005] caregivers whose 
family members are residing in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) will be recruited, screened for inclusion criteria, and randomly assigned to either CGMI-V or a Minimal Treatment (MT) control condition. Caregivers in the CGMI-V will participate in eight weekly, professionally led, real-time, live streaming video online group sessions. Those caregivers in the MT condition will receive written information materials about late stage ADRD at baseline. For both conditions, data will be collected at baseline (pre-intervention), 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention) for intervention effects, and at [ADDRESS_1235006]-baseline for maintenance effects.
Primary Outcome: Controlling for background variables, establish effect sizes of the 
CGMI-V condition and Minimal Treatment (MT) control condition on changes in caregiver 
chronic grief. We hypothesize that caregivers in the CGMI-V condition compared to those 
in the MT control condition, will report decreased chronic grief levels.Secondary Mental Health Outcomes: Controlling for background variables, establish effect 
sizes of the CGMI-V and Minimal Treatment (MT) control condition on changes in caregiver symptoms of depression and anxiety and on positive states of mind. We 
hypothesize that caregivers in the CGMI-V condition compared to those in the MT control group will report (2.1) decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety and (2.2) increased positive mental states. Secondary Facility-related Outcomes: Controlling for background variables, establish 
effect sizes of the CGMI-V condition and the Minimal Treatment (MT) control condition on changes in caregiver satisfaction with care provided in the facility and conflict with 
staff. We hypothesize that caregivers in the CGMI-V condition compared to those in the 
MT control condition will report (3.1) increased satisfaction with care provided in the facility and (3.2) decreased conflict with staff. Mechanism of Intervention Outcome: Explore mechanisms of intervention impact on 
caregiver outcomes. We hypothesize that CGMI-V works by [CONTACT_882746]: lack of knowledge, sense of loss, guilt, and role captivity.
Study population and location: We will recruit a sample of [ADDRESS_1235007] family caregivers. Caregivers will be randomly assigned to either the CGMI-V condition (n=72) or the MT control condition (n=72). Caregivers will receive the CGMI-V intervention at home or another location of their choosing, using iPads with an online platform (WebEx). Caregivers in the MT condition will receive written ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/[ADDRESS_1235008] at baseline. Each individual caregiver is expected to be 
in the study for a total of 24 weeks from enrollment to follow-up.
Study implementation: The study will be implemented in six waves. Beginning in Month [ADDRESS_1235009] 1, who will be 
randomly assigned to either the CGMI-V condition ( n = 12; 6/group) or MT control 
condition ( n = 12). After these [ADDRESS_1235010]. This pattern will be the same for all six waves. This will result in 144 caregivers being enrolled, 72 for the CGMI-V condition, and 72 for the MT control condition. Figure 1 illustrates the progression of the study waves through the study timeline. 
Intervention: For the CGMI-V intervention condition, study materials (participant manual, 
technology instructions) will be sent to participants electronically. We will mail hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_882709]. The iPad tablet and the earbuds with microphone will be mailed to participants prior to the first session. As needed, caregivers will receive an individualized over-the-phone orientation (20-30 minutes) in the operation of the equipment from the technology assistant. Each session will start with a brief technology check-up and review of ground rules including maintaining confidentiality. 
Each CGMI-V group session will be conducted by [CONTACT_882750]. For treatment fidelity purposes, the study interventionists will be 
trained in the delivery of the group intervention and the iPad and online technology. Each group will have not more than six participants. The intervention consists of approximately 60-minute sessions delivered weekly for eight consecutive weeks and will follow the standardized CGMI-V intervention manual (Appendix A). Figure 1.

4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures 
Recruitment. Successful recruitment strategies used in our prior studies
25-27 will be used. 
These include: (1) a notice describing the study placed in the providers’ monthly newsletters 
distributed to family caregivers at each facility; (2) study flyers and interest forms posted around the LTCFs (e.g., front desk, family lounge); (3) individualized letters mailed by [CONTACT_882752]’ business office introducing the project to family caregivers of ADRD residents; and (4) oral presentations about the project to staff and family caregivers during “family night” events. All written and oral communication will use lay language to describe study purpose, eligibility criteria, intervention, and data collection methods. All written materials will include information about participants’ time commitment and study contact [CONTACT_3031] (e-mail address and phone number) that caregivers may use if interested. Interested participants will call or e-mail the study office or fill out the interest form, agreeing to be contact[CONTACT_66696]. Completed interest forms will be left in the facility’s front office or e-mailed directly to the study e-mail address. Consenting. After they contact [CONTACT_627552], caregivers will be scheduled to undergo 
eligibility screening. The Project Director will describe the screening process and the instruments used to screen and will ask and document caregivers’ verbal consent to be screened for eligibility. Once eligibility is determined, participant caregivers will be ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/[ADDRESS_1235015] about the study prior to obtaining informed consent. If agreeable to join the study and depending on how they preferred to receive the informed consent forms, caregivers will return the signed documents either electronically (e-signature) or in paid, study self-addressed envelopes. Randomization. The study will be implemented in six waves. Beginning in Month [ADDRESS_1235016] 1, who will be randomly assigned to either the CGMI-V condition ( n = 12; 6/group) or MT control 
condition ( n = 12) using a randomization software for clinical trials. After these [ADDRESS_1235017]. This pattern will be the same for all six waves. This will result in 144 caregivers being enrolled, 72 for the CGMI-V condition, and 72 for the MT control condition (Figure 1). 
5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS 
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration 
The intervention consists of approximately 60-minute sessions delivered weekly for eight 
consecutive weeks and will follow the standardized CGMI-V intervention manual (Appendix A). The purpose of the CGMI-V is to improve ADRD caregivers’ (1) knowledge about late-stage ADRD; (2) communication and conflict resolution skills, and (3) skills managing their loss and chronic grief.

25-27, we do not anticipate early termination of the 
CGMI-V study. We will document reasons for participant voluntary drop-out and will ask participants who may have dropped out prior to completing the [ADDRESS_1235028] ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/[ADDRESS_1235029] in a 
long-term care facility. The proposed intervention poses minimal risk to participants. 
During screening and data collection for both conditions, there is potential risk for 
caregivers to disclose:
•Depressive symptoms (high levels indicative of clinical depression)
•Suicidal ideation
During the Chronic Grief Management Intervention-Video (CGMI-V) intervention 
implementation, emotional upset may occur especially during the last four sessions, 
when grief processing becomes the focus of the intervention. Caregivers may disclose 
high levels of: 
•Depressive symptoms (high levels indicative of clinical depression)
•Suicidal ideation
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters
•A score greater than16 points (indicative of risk for clinical depression) on the 
Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2557]-Depression Scale (CES-D)40 
•A score >1 on the PHQ 9 suicidal assessment item:  “Thoughts that you would be 
better off dead or of hurting yourself” 
•Verbalizing suicidal ideation during CGMI-V group session intervention 
implementation
7.[ADDRESS_1235030] in a long-term care facility. The proposed intervention poses minimal risk to participants. 
Identified safety parameters identified above in 7.1 will be assessed at: pre-enrollment screening, and the three data collection points (baseline and 8 and 24-weeks). Interventionists will implement suicide protocol in the event of reported suicidal ideation during group sessions.
7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE)  is generally defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, 
symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or if present at baseline, appears to worsen. An example of an Adverse Event (AE) anticipated for this study would be, during 
data collection, a Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2557]-Depression Scale (CES-D) score greater than16 points, indicative of risk for clinical depression. Whether or not this high ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/2020
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 20score is associated with study participation, we will monitor and report it as an AE, per 
protocol.
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is generally defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly. An example of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) anticipated for this 
study would be a participant’s endorsement of suicidal ideation when screened with the PHQ-9 or disclosing suicidal ideation in a group session. Whether or not associated with study participation, we will monitor and report suicidal ideation or intention as a SAE, per protocol adopted from the Office of the Human Research Protection Program’s Research 
Protocols and Risk of Suicide Guidelines (2012).
An Unanticipated Problem (UP)  for this study would be any study participant incident, 
experience or outcomes that are unexpected in severity or frequency suggesting that 
participants are at greater risk of harm than anticipated. An example of an Unanticipated 
Problem (UP) for this study would be a participant becoming extremely upset with 
intervention content, to the point of droppi[INVESTIGATOR_882719] a consequence. Whether or not associated with study participation, we will monitor and report per protocol. 
7.4 Reporting Procedures
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_882720] (AEs) and serious 
adverse effects (SAEs) (except death) in writing to the NIA Program Officer (PO), Safety 
Officer (SO) and Rush University IRB on a quarterly  basis. 
Any Unanticipated SAEs not listed in the Data Safety Monitoring Plan related to the 
intervention will be reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_882721] 48 hours  from 
determination of occurrence to the NIA PO, SO, and IRB, following–up with a written corrective plan with measures to prevent reoccurrence. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_882722], SO, and IRB on an expedited basis within 24 hours  from determination of occurrence. 
Unanticipated problems including other incidents, outcomes, or experiences that are not 
SAEs (e.g. data breach, confidentiality threat) will be reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_882723], SO, and IRB within 48 hours , including a corrective plan and measures to 
prevent reoccurrence. .ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/2020
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 217.5 Follow-up for Adverse Events
Participants experiencing AEs will be referred for outpatient or inpatient treatment 
(depending on severity). Follow-up will span the 24-week duration of the study participation.
7.6 Safety Monitoring
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring participant and data safety 
on a daily basis. As a Stage I, single site, and minimal risk study, we will establish an internal committee to assist with data safety monitoring (DSM). In addition, an NIA-approved Safety Officer (SO) will oversee the DSM, and will review data and adverse events twice per year and more frequently if necessary. The SO will act in an advisory capacity to the NIA Director and PO to monitor participant safety, evaluate the progress of the study, and to review procedures for maintaining the confidentiality of data, the quality of data collection, management, and analyses. 
8 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION 
CGMI-V is a Stage I, single site, minimal risk behavioral intervention study. There is no 
anticipated intervention discontinuation for this study. Study participants may withdraw 
voluntarily from participation in the study at any time and for any reason. We will continue to follow these participants, with their permission, at the 8 and 24 week assessment points . 
Participants in the CGMI-V condition who discontinue early will not be replaced, as this is a group-based intervention where “the dose” consists of eight consecutive weekly group sessions.
[ADDRESS_1235031] caregivers whose 
family members are in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) will be recruited, screened for inclusion criteria, and randomly assigned to either CGMI-V or a Minimal Treatment (MT) control condition. Caregivers in the CGMI-V condition will participate in eight weekly professionally led, real-time, live-streaming video online group sessions. Those caregivers in the MT control condition will receive written information materials about late-stage ADRD at baseline. For both conditions, data will be collected at baseline (pre-intervention), 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention) for intervention effects, and [ADDRESS_1235032] baseline for maintenance effects. The design for this study was chosen to avoid the type of group clustering or contamination that would be engendered by [CONTACT_2224] a randomized cluster design. The study hypotheses are outlined below:ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/2020
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 22Primary Hypothesis
Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize that caregivers in the CGMI-V condition compared to those 
in the MT control condition, will report decreased chronic grief levels.
Secondary Hypotheses
Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that caregivers in the CGMI-V condition compared to those 
in the MT control group will report (2.1) decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety and (2.2) increased positive mental states. 
Hypothesis 3.1 and 3.2:  We hypothesize that caregivers in the CGMI-V condition compared 
to those in the MT control condition will report (3.1) increased satisfaction with care provided in the facility and (3.2) decreased conflict with staff. 
Mechanism of Intervention Hypothesis 
Hypothesis 4: We hypothesize that CGMI-V works by [CONTACT_882754]: lack of knowledge, sense of loss, guilt, and role captivity.
Primary Outcome Measures  
Caregiver Chronic Grief will be measured with the 50-item Marwit-Meuser Caregiver Grief 
Inventory (MM-CGI).6 This inventory has three subscales: (1) Personal Sacrifice Burden: 18 
items measuring individual losses experienced as a result of caregiving, (2) Heartfelt Sadness 
and Longing: 15 items measuring interpersonal emotional reactions in response to 
caregiving, and (3) Worry and Felt Isolation: 17 items measuring feelings of losing 
connections with, and support from, others. Items are rated on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly 
disagree  to 5 = strongly agree ), with a possible range of 50 to 250 points. Grief scores may 
be calculated by [CONTACT_882755] a total grief score. Total grief scores above 175 indicate high levels of caregiver grief, requiring formal intervention and support. Cronbach’s alpha subscale scores range from .[ADDRESS_1235033] Cronbach’s alpha scores range from .71 to .75, indicating stability of the measure over time in all three subscales.

Secondary Outcomes Measures
Depressive symptoms will be measured with the 20-item version of The Center for 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_67905] (CES-D).40 Responses are based on a four-point 
frequency rating (0 = rarely or none of the time  to 3 = all of the time ), with a possible range 
of 0 to 60. A score above 16 indicates existence of depressive symptoms. Internal consistency reliability range r =.[ADDRESS_1235034] reliability r = .45 to .70.

Protocol Template, Version 3.0 23Anxiety symptoms will be measured with the 20-item State-Anxiety subscale of the State-
Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).41 Responses are based on a scale of 1 to 4 (1 = almost never  
to 4 = almost always ), with a possible range of 20-80, where higher scores indicate greater 
anxiety. Alpha coefficients for older adults range .90-.92, indicating high internal consistency reliability.
41 
Positive States of Mind will be measured with the Positive States of Mind Scale (PSOMS)42 
to assess the extent to which caregivers were able to achieve six positive states of mind in the 
previous seven days. Other studies21 found that caregivers who scored high on the PSOMS 
also scored lower on the grief scale. The scale comprises six items that capture: (1) focused attention, (2) productivity, (3) responsible caregiving, (4) restful repose, (5) sensuous nonsexual pleasure, and (6) sharing. The responses range from 0 = unable to achieve  to 3 = 
easy to achieve . Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was .77, indicating high internal consistency 
reliability. 
Conflict with facility staff will be measured with a subscale of the Family Perception of 
Caregiving Role (FPCR). The 61-item FPCR3,30 contains four subscales to measure 
dimensions of role stress: (1) loss of relationship aspects with care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], (2) guilt from perceived failure in caregiving, (3) captivity resulting from obligations of caregiving, and (4) conflict with facility staff related to caregiving. Responses are rated on a 7-point Likert scale 
(1 = strongly disagree  to 7 = strongly agree ), with a possible range of 61 to 427. Items are 
summed to form subscale scores and a total FPCR score. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranging from .[ADDRESS_1235035] with Facility Staff subscale; its Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is .84. 
Satisfaction with care will be measured with the Family Perceptions of Care Tool (FPCT).3.[ADDRESS_1235036] caregivers’ perceived satisfaction 
with: (1) physical care provided to their family member in the facility, (2) activities for facility residents, (3) unit management, and (4) staff consideration for resident and family member. Responses are rated on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree  to 7 = strongly 
agree ), with a possible range of [ADDRESS_1235037] score. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranging from .[ADDRESS_1235038] caregiver chronic grief: (1) caregiver lack of

Protocol Template, Version 3.0 24Knowledge of dementia/AD will be measured with the 22-item Family Knowledge of 
Alzheimer’s Test (FKAT).30 This instrument captures what a family caregiver knows about 
the disease process, how the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_882724], and how the LCTF is caring for him or her. Responses are based on a true/false scale, with a maximum score of [ADDRESS_1235039] reliability was .82 ( p < .05), KR 21 ( n = 50) = .61. 
Loss will be measured with the 7-item Loss subscale of the FPCR
3,30 (full description above). 
Cronbach’s alpha for this subscale was 0.73. Guilt will be measured with the 5-item Guilt subscale of the FPCR
3,30 (full description 
above). Cronbach’s alpha for this subscale was 0.70. Role captivity will be measured with the 7-item Captivity subscale of the FPCR
3,30 (full 
description above). Cronbach’s alpha for this subscale was 0.81. Background Measures
Caregiver and care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_882725]-demographics. To describe caregiver and care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_882726], we will collect standardized information. These survey questions 
are drawn from the initial population survey used by [CONTACT_882756][INVESTIGATOR_882727] (EPES).
[ADDRESS_1235040] questions will be asked at baseline to assess: (1) number of years 
since the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_882728], (2) time since placement in the LTCF, and (3) visiting pattern in the LTCF (times per week and number of hours per visit).
9.[ADDRESS_1235041] error of measurement (SEM) around this effect size estimate will be about 4.47 units, producing confidence intervals between -8.77 and +8.77 units. This will allow us to estimate a Cohen’s d within

We will track all study participants following CONSORT guidelines and enter all data 
into a REDCap database. SPSS for Windows (Version 22) and R (Version 3.1.1) will be used for data management and statistical analysis. A two-tailed 0.[ADDRESS_1235046] statistically normal distributions or distributions that can be transformed to normality using logarithmic and square root transformations. We will perform any necessary transformations using Tukey’s ladder of transformation before conducting statistical analysis. Because these trials are designed to estimate precise effect sizes rather than probability values, the results of each trial will be the effect size (comparing treatment and control groups) and confidence intervals around this estimate. 
Aim 1. Controlling for background variables, establish effect sizes of the CGMI-V 
condition and Minimal Treatment (MT) control condition on changes in a primary 
caregiver chronic grief outcome.Multilevel linear models will be run for the CGMI-V and MT control conditions. Multilevel models are used to estimate autocorrelation across the three time points. We hypothesize that chronic grief will decrease more in the CGMI-V condition relative to the MT control condition. Caregiver sex, age, relationship to the care-receiver, as well as care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_882730], will be controlled for as covariates in the analysis. Sex and caregiver/care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175856], as well as care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_882730], will be entered into the model as dummy-coded 
variables. We will examine the interaction effects (δ) to make certain that they are large ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/[ADDRESS_1235047] sizes of the CGMI-V 
condition and MT control condition on changes in secondary caregiver mental health outcomes: depression symptoms and anxiety symptoms and positive states of mind. We hypothesize that one dependent measure (positive states of mind) will increase more and the other two (depression symptoms and anxiety symptoms) will decrease more in the CGMI-V group relative to the MT control condition. Apart from the dependent measures examined, this analysis will parallel that described in Aim 1. As in Aim 1, the primary goal of this analysis is to estimate effect sizes associated with the CGMI-V. Aim 3. Controlling for background variables, compare the effect sizes of the CGMI-V 
condition and MT control condition on secondary facility-related outcomes: caregiver satisfaction with care and conflict with staff in the LTCF. We hypothesize that caregiver satisfaction with care will increase and that conflict with staff in the LTCF will decrease in the CGMI-V condition relative to the MT control condition. Apart from the dependent measures examined, this analysis will also parallel that described in Aim 1. As in Aim 1, the primary goal of this analysis is to estimate effect sizes associated with the CGMI-V. Aim 4. Examine the mediating effects of chronic grief exacerbators on chronic grief, 
mental health, and facility-related outcomes. We hypothesize that improvement in chronic grief exacerbators will mediate the improvements in caregiver chronic grief, mental health, and facility-related outcomes. 
The focus of the proposed study is on change in chronic grief, mental health, and 
facility-related outcomes between measurement points and change in chronic grief exacerbators as a mediating variable. Thus, we propose to use residualized change scores (i.e., the difference between the observed score of a variable and the predicted score based on the baseline measure of that variable) throughout the analyses. These scores have the advantage of evaluating change between measurement points without concerns about regression toward the mean that are associated with standard change scores and have the advantage of reducing the number of variables in the model. In general, the analytic model will include covariates to control for background characteristics of the participants and time since baseline. The mediation effects of changes in chronic grief exacerbators (lack of knowledge, sense of loss, guilt, and role captivity) on three outcome measures (chronic grief, mental health, and facility-related outcomes) will be examined in three separate models. The regression mediation models described in MacKinnon
76 will be used to estimate these effects. The null hypothesis is 
that changes in chronic grief exacerbators will not mediate any of the three outcome ORA: 18041811-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 6/24/2019   Amendment Date: 5/4/[ADDRESS_1235048] sizes

The following NIH ethical principles guide the CGMI-V study: (1) social and clinical 
value, (2) scientific validity, (3) fair subject selection, (4) favorable risk-benefit ratio, (5) independent review, (6) informed consent, and (7) respect for potential and enrolled subjects. In practice, we enact these principles in the following ways:
1) We seek to establish effect sizes for the CGMI-video intervention on chronic grief in 
caregivers of persons diagnosed with ADRD who were placed in long-term care facilities LTCFs). Chronic grief can contribute to mental health problems in family caregivers, such as anxiety, depression, and suicidality.
5-8,22 Moreover, family caregiver grief and its 
exacerbators (lack of knowledge, sense of loss and guilt, and caregiver role captivity) can provoke dissatisfaction with care provided in the LTCFs and increase conflict with staff. 
3,11,12Although placement exacerbates family caregivers’ grief, LTCF do not provide 
families with grief-focused support specific to this transition.12,[ADDRESS_1235056] caregivers whose family members are in LTCF.2) We were unable to find any existing post-placement, online group interventions for ADRD caregivers. Therefore, we pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-tested a professionally led, post-placement, live-streaming video, online group intervention: the CGMI-Video. For the CGMI-V pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], retention was high (100%), and caregivers expressed satisfaction with the method of delivery, leading us to develop CGMI-V in a Stage I randomized clinical trial. 3) We will recruit participants who have a family member residing in one of [ADDRESS_1235057] dementia care and/or memory care units owned by [CONTACT_882758]-profit LTCF providers. We have access to a pool of family caregivers of more than 1,[ADDRESS_1235058] recruited from them for our preliminary studies.4) The intervention poses minimal risks to participants.

The PI [INVESTIGATOR_882737] (AEs) and serious adverse effects (SAEs) (except death) in writing to the NIA 
Program Officer (PO), Safety Officer (SO) and Rush University IRB on a quarterly  
basis. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_882738], SO, and IRB on an expedited basis within 24 hours  from determination of occurrence. Unanticipated 
problems including other incidents, outcomes, or experiences that are not SAEs (e.g. data 
breach, confidentiality threat) will be reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_882739], SO, and IRB within 48 hours , including a corrective plan and measures to prevent 
reoccurrence.6) The study informed consent outlines the purpose of the study, provides information regarding rights of study participants, outlines study procedures, and communicates information concerning confidentiality and the voluntary nature of study participation. Participants will be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time without jeopardizing theirs’ or their family members’ access to care in the facility where the study is being conducted.7) We ensure respect for participants and potential participants by [CONTACT_882759], following all data safety monitoring protocol, and protecting the confidentiality of participants and potential participants.

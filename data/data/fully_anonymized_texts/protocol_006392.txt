Official Title: Neural Correlates of Lidocaine Analgesia  
 
ClinicalTrials.gov ID (NCT number): [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
Document Date: 6/20/[ADDRESS_185755] will be 
scheduled for their study visit, and reminders sent by [CONTACT_6968]/text at their preference.   
Subjects will be given instructions for several pre -visit restrictions.  1 - They will be 
asked to abstain from caffeine intake for 8 hours prior to their visit.  This ensures that 
the vasoconstrictive effects do not interfere with the blood flow response on which fMRI 
depends (avoiding an experimental confound). 2 - The participant wil l avoid any solid 
food, fat, or protein intake for 8 hours prior to their visit. Subjects will also avoid clear 
liquids for 2 hours prior to the visit, for the same reason. Th is is to ensure their stomach 
is empty and to prevent a possible complication of regurgitation or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], consistent 
with American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelines for preoperative oral intake. (1) [ADDRESS_185756] to get home (without driving) from the study visit.   
On arrival, subjects will be met by a member of the study team in the BST3 lobby, and 
be escorted through the secure facility to the 7T research scanner in the basement.  
Urine sample will be obtained from female subjects  (private bathroom is available) , and 
pregnancy test will be performed on the sample.  Subjects will be informed of the result.  
A nerve stimulator (EZ Stim II, Life Tech; currently being used in STUDY 19030183 ) will 
be connected to a finger with two small electrodes. A low amplitude  electrical current 
will then be delivered. Starting at zero, the intensity will slowly be increased until they 
report a pain of [ADDRESS_185757] of (at least) looking in the mouth  and listening to the heart and 
lungs with a stethoscope.  An intravenous (IV) catheter will be placed, likely in the hand 
or arm , and will remain in place  throughout the study.  Baseline vital signs will be 
obtained.  
Subjects  will be asked additional screening questions by [CONTACT_160028], per their 
protocol, to ensure that it is safe to undergo MRI scanning (no metal or electronic 
implants, no metal -containing tattoos, etc). Prior to entering the MRI environment, 
subjects  will be asked to remove any jewelry , electronic,  and glasses . In the unlikely 
event that their shirt contains  metal, they will be provided a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_160026].  
Subjects will then enter the scanner room,  receive ear plugs  and be connected to vital 
sign monitors, to measure yo ur heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing  (expi[INVESTIGATOR_160027]) . They will be connected to the IV lines and the crystalloid IV carrier fluid 
infusion will begin.  From this point forward, regular vital signs will be obtained and 
documented, as would be done for a clinical anesthetic.  The physician anesthesiologist 
will monitor the patient while they are receiving and recovering from the lidocaine 
infusion.  
The experimental protocol consists of 3 basic elements: 4 -minute battery of cognitive 
tasks (asynchronous with scanning), a functional MRI scan during a [ADDRESS_185758] periods , 
and an 8 -minute resting -state (task -free) functional MRI scan .  This will be performed 
first under just the IV fluid carrier infusion. Then, lidocaine will be administered, using a 
bolus+infusion strategy to reach steady -state effect -site target concentrat ion of 1 
mcg/ml.  This level will be maintained for at approximately 20  minutes, while the above 
tasks/scans are obtained again under the low -dose lidocaine condition. When 
completed, an additional bolus and higher infusion rate of lidocaine will be administered 
to achieve an effect -site concentration of 1.5 mcg/ml.  This lev el will be maintained for 
approximately 16 minutes, and the above three tasks/scans repeated under the high -
dose lidocaine condition. Dosing schedules to achieve effect -site targets wil l be 
calculated on a per -subject basis using available modeling software  and published 
pharmacokinetic models that account for sex, age, weight, and height.  For reference, 
the total dose of lidocaine that would be administered to a prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] [ADDRESS_185759] would be <150 mg of lidocaine  over the anticipated 40 minutes of infusion time . 
Structural (anatomical ) scans will be obtained during transition periods of drug dosing , 
to minimize time exposed to the drug and time spent in the scanner .  These needed 
scans for subsequent analysis are typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 4 minutes or less , and t ime needed for drug 
levels to reach steady state are similarly 6 -7 minutes .  Thus the total time spent in the 
scanner is anticipated to be less than 1 hour.  
Subjects will then be removed from the scanner .  Once sitting up, and after the 
resolution of any acute dizziness from moving through the magnetic field and/or the 
drug, they will be escorted to the adjacent recovery room. They  will then be monitored 
by [CONTACT_160029]. Subjects will 
paid $150 during this recovery period.  Once it is safe to do so, their IV will be removed 
and they  will be discharged  from anesthesia care , anticipated to be  <[ADDRESS_185760] a vehicle or operate 
machinery after receiving lidocaine. There are no follow -up procedures.  Subjects will be 
given the PI’s contact [CONTACT_160030].

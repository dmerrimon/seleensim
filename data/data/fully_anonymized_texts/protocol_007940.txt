PURPOSE OF STUDY 
The purpose of this clinical study is to determine the effectiveness of the Erchonia® EVRL 
(manfactured by [CONTACT_259272] (the Company)), when both the red and violet diodes are 
activated simultaneously, in providing temporary relief of minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of 
musculoskeletal origin. 
 
STUDY DURATION 
The 
estimated total duration of the study is two days (48 hours). 
 
INDICATION FOR USE 
The 
indication (claim) being sought through support of the results of this clinical study is: “The 
Erchonia® EVRL is indicated for adjunctive use in  providing temporary relief of minor chronic neck 
and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin”  
 
It is intended that the results of this clinical study be used to support a 510(k) submission to FDA

REGULATORY BACKGROUND 
 
The Erchonia® EVRL Laser being evaluated in this clinical study for adjunctive use in providing 
temp
orary relief of minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin has received 
FDA clearance under K050672 for the following indication:  
 
The Erchonia EVRL Laser is generally indicated: 
 
a. while using the red diode, for adjunctive use in  providing temporary relief of minor chronic 
neck and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin, and 
b. while using the blue diode, to treat dermatological conditions, and specifically indicated to 
treat moderate inflammatory Acne Vulgaris. 
 
However, its application in this clinical trial is experimental, as it is the goal of the current study to 
demonstrate non-inferiority in efficacy of the Erchonia® EVRL when used in simultaneous dual 
diode mode (both the red (640 nm) and violet (405 nm) diodes activated simultaneously) compared 
to its use with the red diode only activated. 
 
DEVICE DESCRIPTION & DETAILS 
 
The Erchonia® EVRL (Model# EVRL) used in this study is a hand held low level laser that uses two 
semi
-conductor diodes; a 640 nanometer (visible red light) and a 405 nanometer (visible violet light), 
each emitting its wavelength with a tolerance of ±10 nanometer. The lasers are powered by [CONTACT_341363] a separate inductive charging base powered by [CONTACT_341364]. This configuration offers portability as well as consistency of power. 
The Erchonia® EVRL is a variable hertz device. The variable hertz feature of the Erchonia® EVRL 
is a pulsed wave, defined as containing a selected series of breaks, variances that are 
preprogrammed.

MATERIALS 
 
STUDY INDICATION: CHRONIC NECK AND SHOULDER PAIN OF MUSCULOSKELETAL 
ORIGIN  
 
Definition  
Chronic pain of musculoskeletal origin arises from impairment of the muscles, ligaments and 
tendons, and bones. The neck refers to the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_341337] [ADDRESS_422398] them and the ligaments and muscles that provide neck stability, 
function, and movement. Impairment therein primarily results in pain and reduced range of motion 
in the neck and shoulders region. 
 
Statistics 
• Pain affects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined.   
• In 2011, at least 100 million adult Americans reported chronic pain conditions, with women more 
likely to experience chronic pain than men. 
• The total annual health care costs (medical costs and economic costs related to disability days 
and lost wages and productivity) related to treatment of chronic pain conditions in the United 
States ranges from $560 billion to $635 billion (averaging to about $2,000 per U.S. adult).  
• Chronic pain is reported to have a significant impact on quality of life: 59% report an impact on 
overall enjoyment of life; 77% report feeling depressed; 70% report trouble concentrating; 74% 
reported reduced energy level; and 86% report sleep disruption. 
• The National Institute of Health Statistics survey reports chronic neck pain as being the second 
most common pain complaint (second to low back pain), experienced by 15% of the U.S. adult 
population at any one time.   
• Over half (53%) of the workforce reports some form of musculoskeletal pain at any one time, and 
about 13% lost productive work time averaging 5.5 hours per week while experiencing 
musculoskeletal pain.

Anatomy of the Neck 
The spi[INVESTIGATOR_341338] 3 separate sections: the neck, the mid back and the low 
back. The neck refers to the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], which is comprised of the top [ADDRESS_422399] of degenerative changes or trauma, that 
the neck is vulnerable to injury and susceptible to pain. 
 
Etiologies of Neck/Shoulder Pain 
There are many causes of neck/shoulder pain, such as muscle sprain, strain and spasms, arthritis, 
disc problems, tendinitis, vascular problems, trauma and tumors. Causes of musculoskeletal 
neck/shoulder pain include muscle tissue damage due to wear and tear from daily activities; trauma 
(jerking movements, auto accidents, falls, fractures, sprains, dislocations, and direct blows to the 
muscle); postural strain; repetitive movements; overuse and prolonged immobilization. 
 
In this clinical study, the most common cause of chronic neck/shoulder pain is being evaluated – 
the musculoskeletal conditions of muscle sprain, strain and spasms.

聀 ֤ ◌Erchonia® EVRL Neck & Shoulder Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 1.0       Page 10  March 21, 2018 Muscle Strain, Sprain and Spasm of Musculoskeletal Origin 
Muscle strain, sprain and muscle spasm of musculoskeletal origin refers to damage to a muscle or 
its attaching tendons due to undue pressure placed on muscles during the course of normal daily 
activities, including those that involve sudden heavy lifting, sports activities or other physical 
exertions, or while performing work tasks. Muscle damage can involve tearing of some or all of the 
muscle fibers and the tendons attached to the muscle. This tearing can also damage small blood 
vessels, causing local bleeding, or bruising, and pain caused by [CONTACT_341366]. 
 
Muscle sprain and strain  occurs with a sudden stressful injury to the region causing stretching or 
tearing of the muscle/tendons/ligaments that results in pain and restricted range of motion. ‘Sprain’ 
refers to injury of the muscles, whereas ‘strain’ refers to injury of the ligaments.   
 
The muscles and ligaments in the neck and shoulder regions are part of the body’s upper extremity. 
The upper extremity is innervated by [CONTACT_341367][INVESTIGATOR_050]. Sprain 
strain in the neck and/or shoulder regions refers to an injury that causes a sprain to a muscle or 
strain to a ligament that effects pain and restricts range of motion in those areas that is linked to 
degraded integrity of the accompanying cervical and thoracic nerve supply. 
 
In a muscle strain, the tension or extreme stretching that occurs causes the muscles to cramp or 
tear during physical exertion. Efforts to move are then replaced by [CONTACT_341368]. 
The pain of muscle strain or spasms arises from the sustained contraction of the muscle fibers, as 
well as from possible tearing of the fibers which may be felt as a hard knot in the strained muscle.  
 
Chronic muscle spasms  (also known as muscle cramp, -pulled" muscle, or tight muscle) are an 
indirect injury to a muscle, usually from muscle fatigue and overuse that results from involuntary 
contractions of a muscle or a group of muscles causing pain and interference with function. 
 
Neck and shoulder spasms are involuntary contractions of the muscles in the neck and shoulders 
wherein the muscles get tight, hard, and painful. Neck spasms most commonly result from injury, 
overuse, poor posture, or stress 
 
Common types of physical activity or exertion that may result in muscle strain/sprain/spasms and 
resultant pain in the neck and shoulder include running, climbing, extreme reaching with the arms, 
or turning/twisting of the head, neck, or back. Another common scenario is poor ergonomic designs 
and situations in work-related settings, such as holding the neck or back in an abnormal position 
while sitting at the desk or computer for prolonged periods and bad posture. 
 
Symptoms 
Primary symptoms of muscle strain/sprain/spasms of musculoskeletal origin include :  
• pain and soreness in the neck/shoulders that worsens with movement 
• neck/shoulder stiffness, tightness and weakness 
• limited range of motion of the neck/shoulders 
 
Addi
tional potential symptoms include:  
• headaches 
• tender or trigger spots in the neck/shoulder 
• a hard knot tender upon palpation  
• fatigue 
• sleep disturbances

 ְ◌Erchonia® EVRL Neck & Shoulder Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 1.0       Page 11  March 21, 2018 Diagnosis 
Comprehensive evaluation of neck and shoulder pain and its etiology determination comprises:  
 
• Medical and patient history (including general lifestyle, work and typi[INVESTIGATOR_341339]) as well as detailed exploration of the events and activities surrounding onset of the 
pain 
• Comprehensive physical examination, including evaluation of range of motion and neurologic 
evaluation of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_341340], including muscle strength, skin sensation, and 
examination of reflexes 
• Diagnostic evaluation (possibly, if indicated) that may include routine lab tests, x-rays and 
imaging studies such as CT scan, MRI, and myelogram 
 
Treatment Options 
Standard conservative treatment options  for muscle strain, sprain and spasm typi[INVESTIGATOR_341341]:  
• rest 
• ice and heat application 
• compression 
• brace immobilization 
• non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen, analgesics 
such
 as acetaminophen or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and muscle relaxants 
• rehabilitation exercises such as strengthening or stretching exercises for the shoulder and upper 
and/
or lower back muscles, rotation and side-bending exercises for the neck and chin exercises 
to improve posture 
• Stress management 
 
Other treatments  may include: 
• injections with anesthetic or anti-inflammatory medications in or around the painful sites 
• physical or occupational therapy 
• acupuncture or acupressure 
• relaxation/biofeedback techniques 
• osteopathic manipulation  
• chiropractic care 
• therapeutic massage 
 
Current treatments for pain have yielded mixed results. Pain relief and anti-inflammatory 
medications remain the primary treatment option of choice; however, only about half of patients 
who take prescription and/or over-the-counter medication for chronic pain reported ineffective pain 
relief.  Additionally, prescription painkiller use abuse and addiction rates are very high and a major 
contributor to unintentional drug deaths.

tissues.     
 
Lasers can strengthen damaged cells. Using photochemical processes, laser light inserts bio-
photons into damaged cells. The cells begin to produce energy (ATP), which improves their 
function, assists their division, strengthens the body's immune system, and causes the secretion of 
various hormones. The tissues are healed, and pain diminishes. If damaged cells have died, the 
bio-photons help the division of neighboring cells, generating new tissues, and thus bring about 
healing.  
 
Therefore, LLLT: 
 
• promotes healing by [CONTACT_158502], increasing ATP production and activating enzymes  
   in the targeted cells 
• cultivates a growth factor response within the cells and tissue as a result of increased ATP and 
  protein synthesis 
• improves cell proliferation  
• provides pain relief as a result of increased endorphin release 
• strengthens the immune system response via increasing levels of lymphocyte activity

THEORY OF MECHANISM OF OPERATION OF THE APPLICATION OF LOW LEVEL LASER 
THERAPY TO REDUCING CHRONIC NECK AND SHOULDER PAIN   
 
Considering the general mechanism of operation of LLLT as explained above, it follows that LLLT 
provides relief from neck and shoulder pain arising from musculoskeletal conditions by: 
 
• penetrating the skin of the neck and shoulder region through to the ligaments and tendons to 
increase the production of ATP and activate enzymes in the targeted cells of the tissue to promote 
healing of the tendons and ligaments 
 
   • cultivating a growth factor response within the cells and tissue as a result of the increased ATP 
  production to promote new, healthier cell and tissue growth to strengthen and support ligaments 
and tendons, to restore strength and flexibility and to protect against further damage 
 
• The anti-inflammatory properties of low level lasers reduce nerve irritation and inflammation that 
consequently provides pain relief.

Erchonia® EVRL Neck & Shoulder Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 1.[ADDRESS_422402] of red laser light on reducing neck and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal 
origin has already been successfully demonstrated. It is believed that in addition to the healing and 
anti-inflammatory mechanisms of red laser light, the additive properties of blue/violet laser light will 
interact with those of red laser light to affect a comparable or greater therapeutic effect on the 
reduction of pain in individuals with neck and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin than 
application of red diode energy alone. It is the goal of this current study to evaluate this theory.

Version 1.0       Page 24  March 21, 2018 STUDY DESIGN 
 
This clinical study is a single (active) group non-inferiority design to be conducted at a single test 
site to evaluate the efficacy of the Erchonia® EVRL in the temporary reduction of neck and shoulder 
pain of musculoskeletal origin. 
 
SUBJECT GROUP  
 
There will be a single subject group in this study. All subjects will receive the active study procedure 
with
 the red and violet diodes of the Erchonia® EVRL emitted simultaneously. 
 
Comparative subject data for the red diode alone procedure administration will be taken from the 
2001 study whose results supported FDA market clearance for K050672. 
 
BLINDING 
 
As all subjects in this study will receive the active procedure administration with the Erchonia® 
EVRL, neither subjects nor investigators will be blinded. The statistician analyzing the study results 
will however be blinded with respect to study success analysis. The data from this dual-diode 
activation study and the retrospective data from the 2001 red diode only study will be deidentified 
and presented to the study statistician as ‘Group A’ and ‘Group B’. The statistician will not be aware 
of which group – A or B – contains the current study dual-diode data and which contains the 
retrospective red diode only data. 
 
RANDOMIZATION  
 
As this study is a single treatment group study, randomization to procedure group is not applicable. 
Therefore, this is a non-randomized trial. 
  
SUBJECTS  
 
Subject Sample 
Subjects will be males and females 18 years or older who present with chronic (30 consecutive 
days or longer) neck and/or shoulder pain diagnosed as being of musculoskeletal origin 
(osteoarthritis, chronic muscle spasm, cervical and thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_341344]). 
 
Sample Size 
There will be 43 qualified subjects enrolled in this study. 
 
Rationale for Sample Size 
Sample size is determined to be identical to that of subjects enrolled in each of the active and 
control treatment groups in the comparative reference study. 
 
Recruitment 
Subjects will be recruited from among: 
 
(i) The Principal Investigator’s/test site’s pool of existing and new patients 
(ii) Referrals from other suitable medical clinics and professionals 
(iii) Subjects who respond to the following recruitment materials:

VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) DEGREE OF PAIN RATING 
Subjects will be asked to rate the overall degree of pain experienced in the neck/shoulder region 
on the following 0-100 mm (0 -10 cm) Visual Analog Pain Scale, by [CONTACT_259300]: 
 
“Using the scale below, please mark with a cross (X) a SINGLE SPOT along the [ADDRESS_422405] shows how much pain you feel in your neck/shoulder  right now. ‘0’ means you feel no 
pain at all and ‘100’ means you feel the worst pain imaginable. PLEASE MARK ONLY ONE SPOT. 
DO NOT THINK OF OR WRITE IN A NUMBER.”    
 
    
                 no pain                                                worst pain imaginable 
 
 
The Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) is one of the three most commonly used scales for assessing 
chronic pain. It is a simple scale that consists of a line anchored at one end by a label such as "NO 
PAIN" and at the other end "WORST POSSIBLE PAIN". The subject marks on the line the spot for 
the pain intensity, which is then measured.  
 
Standard guidelines for effective use of the VAS that are followed in this clinical study are: 
 
i. The line should be 10, [ADDRESS_422406] be in absolute terms (e.g. worst pain imaginable); 
iv. The line itself should be clear of any markings and should be horizontal rather than vertical, for 
more reliable measurements.  
 
Used in the above way, it has been shown that the VAS is a proper ratio scale. Like a thermometer, 
this
 means that its two ends are rooted, and a doubling of the score does accurately reflect a 
doubling of the pain. Consequently, sensitive t-tests and ANOVA methods can be used in the 
analysis, so that significant differences can be identified with relatively small sample sizes or small 
differences between groups.

LINEAR RANGE OF MOTION (ROM) MEASUREMENTS 
Mobility in the neck/shoulder region will be measured using a universal inclinometer, as follows:   
 
(i) Shoulder ROM  will be measured from a seated passive abduction, the relaxed position of 
parallel to the side of the body through full extension above the head. Maximum movement is 
180 degrees. 
(ii) Neck ROM  will be measured in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], from forward position to face over shoulder. 
Maximum movement is 90 degrees.

PRIMARY EFFICACY OUTCOME MEASURE: CHANGE IN SUBJECT SELF-REPORTED VAS 
PAIN RATING FROM BASELINE TO STUDY ENDPOINT   
 
Primary efficacy outcome measure for this clinical study is the proportion of subjects who meet the 
stud
y individual success criteria.    
 
Individual Subject Success Criteria 
individual subject success criteria is defined as a 30% or greater decrease in self-reported VAS 
pain rating at study endpoint relative to baseline.  
 
Overall Study Success Criteria.  
Overall study success criteria is defined as at least 65%±5% of subjects meeting the study individual 
success criteria.  
 
The clinical relevance and justification of the individual and overall study success criteria is as 
follows: 
 
• This study is a non-inferiority study, such that the research hypothesis is that the red/violet diode 
combination therapy with the Erchonia® EVRL is either equivalent to or superior to the red diode 
only therapy with the Erchonia® EVRL in effecting a clinically meaningful reduction in neck and 
shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin, based upon the data attained from the red diode only 
clinical trial conducted in 2001 whose results successfully supported 510(k) clearance of 
application of the EVRL in red diode mode only for the identical indication being sought through 
the results of this clinical trial. 
• The individual subject success criteria in this clinical study is identical to that of the comparative 
reference study. 
• The overall study success criteria in this clinical study is based on the actual proportion of 
individual subject successes attained during the comparative reference trial for the active red 
diode treatment group, of 65%. The ±5% is the selected equivalence margin (δ), the maximally 
clinically acceptable difference for which the range of values (60% to 70%) for which the 
efficacies are “close enough” to be considered equivalent. 
• Non-inferiority will be established if the proportion of subjects who attain the individual subject 
success criteria is no more than 5% less than the reference subject group (no less than 60%).  
 
Hypotheses 
• Null Hypothesis : Treatment application of the Erchonia® EVRL in simultaneous dual-diode mode 
(red and blue/violet) is inferior to treatment application of the Erchonia® EVRL in red diode mode 
only in reducing neck and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin. 
• Alternative Hypotheses : Treatment application of the Erchonia® EVRL in simultaneous dual-
diode mode (red and blue/violet) is NOT inferior to treatment application of the Erchonia® EVRL 
in red diode mode only in reducing neck and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin. 
 
Evaluation Time Point 
Study endpoint evaluation is immediately following the study single procedure administration. Study 
success will be analyzed at study endpoint relative to baseline.   
 
The study endpoint evaluation is identical to that in the reference comparative study.

聀 ֤ ◌Erchonia® EVRL Neck & Shoulder Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 1.0       Page 37  March 21, 2018 PRIMARY EFFICACY OUTCOME STATISTICAL EVALUATION  
 
• Pri
mary analysis of efficacy will be according to intent to treat (ITT) analysis (including all 
enrolled subjects) supported by [CONTACT_341373] (PP) analysis (including only subjects who 
completed the study according to the full protocol). Non-inferiority will be established if both the 
ITT and PP analyses agree. 
•  Missing data for the ITT population will be handled through Last Observation Carried Forward 
(LOCF): by [CONTACT_341374].  
• Statistical evaluation of study success will be conducted through the two one-sided test (TOST) 
procedure. Non-inferiority is established at the α=0.05 significance level if the lower limit of the 
(1-2α)*100% confidence interval ((1-2*0.05)*100%=90% confidence interval) for the difference 
in efficacies (dual-diode versus red diode only) is above -δ (60%).  
 
SECONDARY EVALUATIONS 
 
The following secondary evaluations will be performed in support of the primary efficacy evaluation: 
 
• TOST analysis of the difference in the mean change in VAS levels from baseline to endpoint 
between the dual-diode and red only diode treatment administration groups. 
• Descriptive analysis of the change in mean VAS ratings across all study evaluation points 
(baseline, endpoint, [ADDRESS_422419]-procedure). 
• Analysis of change in linear ROM measurements across study evaluation points. 
• Descriptive analysis of categorical subject satisfaction with study outcome ratings. 
 
Secondary evaluation will be conducted within the dual-diode treatment group and between the 
dual-diode and red diode only treatment groups. 
 
COVARIATE ANALYSIS 
 
The impact of the following potential covariates on study outcome will be evaluated:  
 
• Baseline VAS rating 
• Age   
• Gender 
• Ethnicity 
• Etiology 
 
Analysis of results will be performed by [CONTACT_259313].  
 
SAFETY ANALYSES   
 
Safety analyses will be based on all enrolled subjects and will be assessed by [CONTACT_341375]/or reported adverse events between dual-

FOR THE ERCHONIA® EVRL LASER DEVICE  
FOR REDUCING NECK AND SHOULDER PAIN    
CLINICAL STUDY V1.0 03.21.18 
 
NAME
 [CONTACT_341387] : Erchonia® EVRL  
 
INVESTIGATIONAL INDICATION:  The purpose of this clinical study is to determine the 
effectiveness of the Erchonia® EVRL (manfactured by [CONTACT_259272] (the Company)), 
when both the red and blue diodes are activated simultaneously, in providing temporary relief of 
minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin. 
 
The purpose of this clinical study  Erchonia® EVRL Laser being evaluated in this clinical study for 
adju
nctive use in providing temporary relief of minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of 
musculoskeletal origin has received FDA clearance under K050672 for the following indication:  
 
REGULATORY BACKGROUND 
 
The Erchonia® EVRL Laser being evaluated in this clinical study for adjunctive use in providing 
temp
orary relief of minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin has received 
FDA clearance under K050672 for the following indication:  
 
The Erchonia EVRL Laser is generally indicated: 
 
a. while using the red diode, for adjunctive use in  providing temporary relief of minor chronic 
neck and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin, and 
b. while using the blue diode, to treat dermatological conditions, and specifically indicated to 
treat moderate inflammatory Acne Vulgaris. 
 
However, its application in this clinical trial is experimental, as it is the goal of the current study to 
demonstrate non-inferiority in efficacy of the Erchonia® EVRL when used in simultaneous dual 
diode mode (both the red (640 nm) and violet (405 nm) diodes activated simultaneously) 
compared to its use with the red diode only activated. 
 
DEVICE DESCRIPTION & DETAILS 
 
The Erchonia® EVRL (Model# EVRL) used in this study is a hand held low level laser that uses 
two 
semi-conductor diodes; a 640 nanometer (visible red light) and a 405 nanometer (visible violet 
light), each emitting its wavelength with a tolerance of ±10 nanometer. The lasers are powered 
by [CONTACT_341376] a separate inductive charging base powered by [CONTACT_341377]. This configuration offers portability as well as consistency 
of power. The Erchonia® EVRL is a variable hertz device. The variable hertz feature of the 
Erchonia® EVRL is a pulsed wave, defined as containing a selected series of breaks, variances 
that are preprogrammed.   
 
The internal battery powers the two specially created and patented electronic diodes with an 
output of 7.5mW red ± 1 mW and <5mW violet laser. 
 
The device contains software that is embedded in a RAM chip on the PCB. This data includes the 
touch screen images (GUI) and the command prompts that activate the screen icons; work in

OSE OF THE STUDY 
In this study, the Sponsor, Erchonia Corporation, and investigators are studying the use 
of a device called the Erchonia® EVRL that gives off low level laser light. This study is to 
see 
if using the Erchonia® EVRL can help to reduce neck and shoulder pain. The 
Erch
onia® EVRL is cleared for marketing by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
to a
ssist in temporarily reducing chronic neck and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin 
when used in red light mode. However; its use in this study is investigational, as the EVRL 
has not been cleared for market by [CONTACT_341379] (blue) light which is what is being studied in this study. 
 
PROCEDURES 
 If you agree to take part in this study, you will be one of about 43 people taking part. 
 If you agree to take part in this study, you will get the study treatment with the active 
EVRL meaning it will be turned on. 
 To take part in this study, you must agree to not take any medicines or try any other 
treatments to help with your neck and shoulder pain, until your part in the study is over.  
 The study takes 48 hours (2 days) to complete. 
 The study process is as follows:

s, etc.) that relate to your neck and/or shoulder pain if any such information 
is available.  
• Ask you to rate the level of your pain in your neck and/or shoulder on a scale from 
0 to
 100, where ‘0’ means ‘no pain’ and ‘100’ means ‘worst pain imaginable’.  
 
The screening phase lasts about 20 minutes. 
 
Pre-Treatment Phase (Visit 1) 
The pre-treatment phase will start once you have successfully completed the 
screening visit, and we can confirm that you are still eligible for this study. At this 
visit, we will: 
• Get some more information about your neck and/or shoulder pain. 
• Get information about medications you are taking right now for any reason.   
• Get information about your age, gender and ethnicity. 
• Ask you to rate the level of your pain in your neck and/or shoulder on the 0-100 
scal
e as you did during the screening visit.

tment Phase (Visit 1) 
The treatment phase will start once you have successfully completed the pre-
treatment phase, on the same day. 
 
There is a single treatment administration with the Erchonia® EVRL. The treatment 
session takes about 13 minutes.  You will be seated comfortably in a chair and fitted 
with special glasses to block the laser light from your eyes. The light will shine across 
your neck, shoulder, head and back area, but it will not touch your skin. While the 
doctor is doing the study treatment, he or she will gently move your arms about. 
 
You will be asked not to take any medication or do any other treatments to help with 
any neck and/or shoulder pain you may experience for the next 48 hours. 
 
Immediately after the treatment with the Erchonia® EVRL laser, we will: 
• As k
 you to rate the level of your pain in your neck and/or shoulder on a scale from 
0 to 100, as you did during the screening and pre-treatment phases. 
• Do the simple test to see how you move back and forth and from side to side as 
duri
ng the pre-treatment phase. 
• Ask you to rate how satisfied you are with the outcome of the treatment 
admi
nistration with the Erchonia® EVRL Laser on a five-point scale 
  
Post-Treatment Phase (At Home) 
At 24 hours and again at 48 hours after your treatment with the Erchonia® EVRL,  
you 
will need to record the following information on the forms given to you at the test 
site. You will need to: 
• Rate the level of your pain in your neck and/or shoulder on the 0-100 scale.  
• Rate how satisfied you are with the outcome of the treatment administration with 
the Erchonia® EVRL Laser on a five-point scale as you did immediately after the 
treatment administration with the EVRL. 
 
 You must not take any medications or do any treatments to help with any neck 
and/or shoulder pain you may be experiencing during the post-treatment phase. 
 You must return the complete 24-hour and 48-hour forms to the test site as you 
have been instructed. 
 Your part in the study is then over. 
 
RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS 
The only known or anticipated risk with the use of the laser device is that long term 
exposure to laser light could cause damage to eye sight. As a precaution, when you are 
given the treatment with the Erchonia® EVRL, you will be fitted with special darkened 
protective glasses to block out the light. 
 
No adverse events have been noted during prior clinical trials using the Erchonia® EVRL 
Laser. However, the complete risk profile or anticipated risks with the use of the Erchonia® 
EVRL
 laser device is not known. There may be risks to using the device with this study 
procedure such as: 
• skin irritation, 
• itching, 
• discoloring, 
• rash,

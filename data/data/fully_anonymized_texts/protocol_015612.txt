Project Summary/Abstract  
Please limit the following sections to a total of 150 words each .  
Objectives*  
The overall goal of this research program is to improve mental health care in Veterans by  
[CONTACT_359342] -stigmatizing and easily available to Veterans who  
have untreated mental health problems, but choose no t to seek or accept face -to-face VHA mental health care  
services. The specific aims of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_359336] a large -scale RCT to test the effects of Moving Forward (MF) with 
and without peer support (PS) on two populations of Veterans who h ave untreated mental health problems.  
 
Aim 1: Test feasibility and acceptability of recruitment and data collection strategies to study MF + PS in two populations o f 
Veterans with unmet mental health needs.  
Aim 2: Obtain preliminary efficacy results on t he impact of MF and MF+PS on problem -solving skills  
and psychological health in Veterans with unmet mental health needs.  
Research Plan and Methods*  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_359337] o f  
the online problem -solving training, Moving Forward, with and without peer support, in Veterans with untreated  
mental health problems. We will study [ADDRESS_448260] untreated mental health problems. We will adapt an existing guide for peer support for an online  
mental health program for use with MF, train a PS to support use of MF, and monitor fidelity to the guide  
throughout the study. All who agree to enroll will be referred to a study website, where they will be screened,  
provide informed consent, and complete baseline assessments of problem -solving skills and psychological  
health,  which will include measures of quality of life, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Participants will then be  
randomized to one of 3 conditions: a no -treatment control group, MF, or MF+PS. Participants in the two active  
intervention groups will be asked to c omplete the [ADDRESS_448261] will be developed.  
Clinical Relevance to the VA Mission*  
The population of Veterans with mental health (MH) care needs is large and is p rojected to continue growing  
for another [ADDRESS_448262] the program’s use and effectivene ss, peer support staff could be trained to coach a  
range of already available programs and deliver MH care to Veterans who decline other MH care. Results of  
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_359338] a larger study of the impact on pr oblem -solving and  
psychological health of a non -stigmatizing, online program - with and without peer support. If effective, peer  
supported online programs would improve the quality of care to Veterans with unmet MH needs.  
Data Collection And Analysis  
Yes  
If Yes, please describe your plans for statistical analysis:  
To address Aim 1, To accomplish Aim 1, we will collect data on the study measures and on these indicators:  
# enrolled per month; % of eligible who enroll  
% of PS sessions achieving fidel ity after training completion  
% in control group who use MF during 8 weeks of study  
% completing mid -way and post -study measures  
Time using the online program, working with peer supporter  
% of enrolled participants reporting problems using MF online  
% of enrolled participants with complete data  
% in MF and MF + PS who complete 6+ modules  
% of those in MF + PS who have 4+ sessions with PS  
% in MF and MF + PS who rate program as helpful  
% satisfied/very satisfied with care, amount/type of PS contact  
[CONTACT_144214]-training survey about barriers and facilitators to MF use, measures, usefulness of working with PSS, specific impact of PS on  
use of MF, and mpact on problem -solving skills.  
Are target variable SDs in appropriate range for intervention?  
 
We will al so interview [ADDRESS_448263] size (e.g., 90%) of 
MF + PS on problem -solving includes a small effect. MF alone may not have an impact due to lack of MF use and engagement, 
but we expect PS to increase MF use and engagement and MF + PS to improve psychological h ealth. Multilevel Modeling will be 
used to test Condition X Time effects on problem -solving, engagement with the MF course, and psychological health. This 
approach has the advantages of a) permitting missing data, b) modeling within - and between -person dif ferences in change across 
time, and c) inclusion of potential moderating variables in the model (e.g. usage). Power for a Condition X Time interaction for 
symptoms was estimated using GLIMMPSE 2.2.3 (64) to be .58, with on N =120, alpha = .05, [ADDRESS_448264] size estimates of .80, .47, and 0 for the MF + PS, MF alone, and control conditions, respect ively. 
Calculations were based on baseline mean and SD estimates from a study of VHA patients with depression s ymptoms (65) and 
effect size estimates from Greene et al. (34). A correlation will be calculated between participant age and positive impacts for 
problem -solving and for psychological health. We  
expect a small effect (r = -.1 to -.2). A large effect (r = -.5) would indicate that older Veterans are less likely to  
benefit from MF. Power to detect a large effect with N = 80 and alpha = .05 will be .99 (66).

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
Management for patients with distant metastatic disease from solid tu mors is usually conducted with 
palliative intent.  Pulmonary tissue is a common site fo r metastatic seeding, in particular for sarcomatoid 
tumors (1).  Historically, metastat ic disease to the lungs from a pr imary sarcoma has traditionally been by 
[CONTACT_227129] (2-6). 
 
Recently, however, a multimodality approach to treatment  for pulmonary metastatic lesions from various 
malignancies, including sarcoma, has been employed at  this institution.  NCCN guidelines for single 
organ and limited tumor bulk metastases recommend an approach of metastectomy +/- post-operative chemotherapy +/-post-operative RT, in terventional techniques such as RF A or cryoablation, or SBRT/RT 
methods.  Patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma to any site often undergo chemotherapy.   However, it is 
often difficult to determine whether the chemotherapy  alone is effective treating widespread disease (7, 
8). In a study done by [CONTACT_227130], et al, those that were  administered perioperative chemotherapy had a median 
post-metastasis disease-spec ific survival of 24 months vs. 33 mont hs in those those that underwent both 
surgery and chemotherapy. (9).    Thus, the need for local therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy may 
be warranted.  Recently, less invasive techniques, such as SBRT and RFA have been employed in treating oligometastatic disease.  Radiation has typi[INVESTIGATOR_227114].  Hypofractionated sterotacti c body radiation therapy 
(SBRT) is an emerging method of treatment for oli gometastatic disease in the lungs.  SBRT has become 
standard of care for stage I lung cancer in medically inoperable patients with local control rates exceeding 
90% with minimal toxicity (10).  SBRT is increasingly being used to treat pulmonary metastases (11-17).  This is particularly appealing as 
the toxicity is low, control rates are high and in  many cases invasive procedures can be avoided. 
Large hypofractionated doses are used to treat metast atic lesions.  SBRT can be safely administered 
because the volume of each lesion is small with tight  margins.  Moreover, many beams are utilized, so 
that a small fraction of the total dose is administered through each beam, thereby [CONTACT_227131].  However,  all beams coalesce at the target and result in a 
larger, summed, dose (11, 20-21).  Many studies have evaluated outcomes and toxicity in patients who 
have undergone SBRT for pulmonary oligometastasis from various tumor primaries (12).  Lesions are 
usually central or peripherally located and a small proportion is comprised of sarcoma primaries.  
Nonetheless, crude local control rates when utilizi ng this method of treatment are between 67-100% and 
2-year survival ranging between 32-87% (11, 13-19).  Toxicity was acceptable with very few developi[INVESTIGATOR_30462] 3 or 4 complications.  Although local control of pulmonary metastases wi th SBRT is high, there is no prospective data 
evaluating control with SBRT for pulmonary metastases from soft tissue sarcomas.  This is a prospective 
study to document the local control rates with SBR T specifically for pulmonar y metastases from soft 
tissue sarcoma.  This study will pr ospectively document acute and late to xicity, quality of life (QoL), tumor 
control, and survival.    Siva, et al reported a literature revi ew to critically review the effect s of SBRT for treatment of pulmonary 
metastases.  Data from 334 patients combined from  13 publications reported a 2 year weighted local 
control of 77.9% (12).   Rusthoven et al conducted a multi-institutional  Phase I/II trial of SBRT for patients 
with 1-3 lung metastases up to 7cm.  Two year local control was 96% (19). 
 The University of [COMPANY_002]ster retrospectively review ed control rates of 74 sarcoma pulmonary metastases 
in 52 patients from 1990-2006 (22).  Sixteen patient s had surgical procedures for management.  Fifteen 
patients were treated to 74 lesions with SBRT. The pr eferred dose was 50 Gy in 5 fractions.  Two-year 
local control was 88% for all patients treated with radiation although with exclusion of one patient’s lesion 
treated with 30 GY in 10 fractions, local control was 97%.   There was no ≥ grade 3 pulmonary toxicity.

 6 Daily treatment uncertainties include set-up error, in ternal organ motion, tumor size, patient position, and 
patient external contour (23-25).  The precision of radiation depends on the consistency of these planning 
variables.  Changes in these variables may change the dos e to the tumor and organs at risk.  In order to 
ensure coverage of the target during organ move ment, conventionally margins have been added to the 
clinical target volume (CTV) to form a planning target volume (PTV).  However, increasing the margin 
size leads to increased radiation dose to adjacent or gans at risk.  As such, adaptive radiation therapy 
(ART) has been done to decrease the effects of treatment  deviation for each patient.  This allows a re-
optimization of the treatment plans in regards to dose distribution and delivery of radiation with each 
fraction (23-25).     In the lung, delineation of the target  (tumor) for planning is critical (26) .  This is especially important when 
delivering radiation in a stereotactic manner, where margins are smaller compared to conventional 3D 
conformal radiation therapy.  In the lung, target  delineation may be confounded by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_227115].  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_227116] a 4D CT scan,  however, changes in breathing patterns of the patient 
and tumor changes need image guidance as well (26).  Ramsey et al, showed that image-guided and 
ART in patients with lung cancer lead to a decr ease of 21% of lung volume being treated receiving ≥ 20 
Gy (27).     The primary goal of this study is to assess the local management with SBRT for patients with pulmonary 
oligometastatic disease from a sarcoma primary us ing ART.  Toxicity, quality of life, progression and 
survival rates will be obtained for each method.  The goal  is to improve the care of metastatic sarcoma 
patients by [CONTACT_227132].  This study, however, will assess patients who have metastatic disease from a prim ary sarcoma, which has not yet 
been prospectively studied.

a. Conclusions: When normalization to a biologically effective dose (BED) is used a dose of 94 Gy 
at the isocenter and 50 Gy at the PTV margin are demonstrated to give 50% probability of tumor control (TCD50). Multivariate analysis reveal ed the dose at the PTV-margin as the only 
significant factor for local control.

a. Conclusions: Single-fraction stereotactic RT is feasible for selected patients with lung tumors. For 
those with prior thoracic RT, 25 Gy may be too toxic. Higher dose was associated with improved 
local control. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine the treatment efficacy and toxicity.

a. Conclusions:  Megavoltage CT-based image guidance can be used to position lung cancer 
patients daily. This has the potential to decreas e margins associated with daily setup error. 
Furthermore, the adaptive therapy technique described in this article can decrease the volume of healthy lung tissue receiving above 20 Gy. Howe ver, further study is needed to determine 
whether adaptive therapy could result in the underdosing of microscopic extension.

6.0 RADIATION THERAPY 
 
 6.1 Dose Specifications 
The treatment goal for each lesion  peripherally loca ted lesion is 54 Gy in 3 fractions at 18 Gy per 
fraction and for centrally located lesions  50 Gy in 5 fractions at 10 Gy per fraction.  Peripherally 
located lesions are those that are >2cm beyond t he proximal bronchial tree.  Centrally located 
lesions are ≤2 cm from the proximal bronchial tree.  Total dose and fractionation modifications 
may be required to meet normal tissue dose constrai nts.  This will be at the treating physician’s 
discretion based on tumor size, location, organs at ri sk, patient comorbidities and prior treatment.   
(Table 1).

Table 1:  Dose and Fractionation based on Tumor Location 
 
 
 
 
6.2 Treatment Schedule:  Treatments delivered with > [ADDRESS_273172] a minimum of 48 
hour interfraction interval.  For treatments with ≤[ADDRESS_273173] a minimum 24 hour 
interfraction interval.  Treatments will be ideally  completed over 14 days for 3 fraction treatments 
and over 21 days for > 5fract ion treatment schedules.   
6.3 Technical Factors   
Photon (x-ray) beams with photon energies of [ADDRESS_273174] beams.  Photon beam 
energies >[ADDRESS_273175]  travel more than a cumulative distance of 
10 cm through soft tissue (not lung) to reach the isocenter. A minimum field dimension of 3.5 cm 
is required for any field used for treatment delivery.   
6.4 Simulation, Immobilization, Localization for Treatment Delivery 
 
6.4.1 Patient Positioning:  All extra-cranial SBRT patients should be set-up with an alpha cradle 
or vacuum lock immobilization device.  Mu ltiple immobilization devices as well as 
abdominal compression and/or stereotactic body frames may be used upon physician 
request.  
6.4.2 Image Acquisition:  Unless otherwise instru cted by [CONTACT_099], 4D CT and 3D CT s will 
be acquired. The planning CT scans with IV contrast are recommended.  Axial 
acquisitions with gantry 0 degrees  will be required with spacing ≤ 3.0 mm between scans 
in the region of the tumor.  
6.4.3 Localization for Treatment Delivery: Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) will be 
used for each fraction with cone-beam CT or CT on rails. The physician will check and approve the IGRT alignment along with table shi fts prior to each fraction.  When multiple 
lesions are being treated at the same time with more than one isocenter, one isocenter 
will be chosen as the “primary” isocenter for purposes of positioning the patient.  IGRT 
images will be acquired and table shifts m ade for the “primary” isocenter and the 
corresponding lesion will be treated.  Shifts  to the second isocenter will be made and 
orthogonal films acquired and compared to corresponding DRRs.  If shifts are indicated they will be made films repeated and reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_227135].   
6.4.4 This will be repeated for each isocenter  
6.4 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes 
6.4.1 Target volumes: Each target lesion w ill be outlined uniquely designated GTVx (x=1, 2, 3, 
4, or 5 depending on the number of lesions being treated).  GTVs will include only abnormal CT signal consistent with gross tu mor (i.e., the GTV and the clinical target 
volume [CTV] are identical). The GTVs will be defined either on MIP (Maximum Intensity 
Projection) images or using GTVs at 3 phases (inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], expi[INVESTIGATOR_227117]) of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_227118].   An additional 0.[ADDRESS_273176] (craniocaudal ) will be added to the each GTVx (ITVx) to 
create the PTVx  
6.4.2 Treatment Planning:  Three-dimensi onal coplanar or non-coplanar beam arrangements 
will be used. Non-opposing, non-coplanar beams are preferable.  A minimum of 7 beams 
will be used although typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], ≥ 10 beams of radiation will be used.   Field aperture size 
and shape should correspond nearly identically to the projection of the PTV along a 
beam’s eye view.  An exception will be when observing the minimum field dimension of 
3.5 cm when treating small lesions. Prescrip tion lines covering the PTV will typi[INVESTIGATOR_227119] 60-90%.  Higher isodoses (hotspots) must  be within the target and not in adjacent 
normal tissue. The prescription dose will be de livered to the margin of the PTV and fulfill 
the requirements below. 
 
6.4.3 Dose Calculations: Heterogeneity corre ction will be used for dose calculations.   
 6.4.4 Treatment planning criteria:   
 Normalization: The treatment pl an should be normalized such that 100% 
corresponds to the center of mass of the PTV (COMPTV). This point will typi[INVESTIGATOR_227120]. 
 Prescription Isodose Surface Coverage: 95% of the PTV is covered by [CONTACT_227136] 99% of t he target volume (PTV) receives a 
minimum of 90% of the prescription dose. 
 Target Dose Heterogeneity: The prescrip tion isodose surface selected (above) must 
be ≥ 60% of the dose at the center of mass of the PTV (COMPTV) and ≤ 90% of the 
dose at the center of mass of the PTV (COMPTV).  
6.4.5 High Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]: 
 Location:  Any dose > 105% of the prescrip tion dose should occur primarily within the 
PTV itself and not within the normal ti ssues outside the PTV. Therefore, the 
cumulative volume of all tissue outside the PTV receiving a dose > 105% of prescription dose should be no more than 15% of the PTV volume. 
 Conformality The ratio of the prescripti on isodose volume to the PTV volume is 
ideally < 1.2.   
6.4.6 Low Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]:  
 Location: The maximum total dose over all frac tions in Gray (Gy) to any point [ADDRESS_273177] from the PTV in any dire ction should be no greater than 50% of the 
prescription dose. 
 Volume: The ratio 50% of prescription isodos e volume to the PTV volume should  be, 
< 6. 
 
6.5 Critical Structures: Critical Organ Dose-Limits:  See Tabl e 3 for dose limits to the point or 
volume. No part of any OAR will receive more than 105% of the prescribed. In addition, the 
volume of the OAR in question will be minimized, both in length and in the width, with efforts made to reduce the dose to the contralateral wall of the organ. Maximum point dose limits should  
be respected. The total dose will be adjusted when necessary to meet normal tissue dose 
constraints. (Table 3).

start and stop superiorly and inferiorly just as with the named structure. The half lumen of 
the structure should be included in this contour. (This anatomic association may occur for centrally located tumors.  By [CONTACT_227137] a central structure it 
is a centrally located tumor and fractionation for centrally located disease will be used)

explained above in sections 6.1-6.5. Each treatment field will be shaped by [CONTACT_227138]-house MLC preparation system (3) and transferred through the computer 
network to the linear accelerator. The da ily portal image of each treatment field was 
aligned off-line to a reference image using a treat ment verification tool (6). The reference 
image will be obtained from the simulation film, which will include the planned treatment isocenter and delineations of each treatment  field. Throughout the study, daily setup 
errors for each treatment field will be delineated separately using the department’s 
adaptive planning software.

Section 6.4, table 3 in Section 6.5 lists  dose volume limits for specific organs and 
structures. Exceeding these limits by [CONTACT_227139] t han 2.5% constitutes a minor protocol 
violation. Exceeding these limits by [CONTACT_726] 5% constitutes a  major protocol violation.  
 
6.9 Radiation Toxicity :  All acute and late toxicity related to SBRT will be reported.  Study accrual 
will be suspended for and Grade 4 or 5 events possibly related to study treatment.  
 
6.8.1 Toxicities related to Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (24): 
Cough, pneumonitis, atelectasis, bronchial  obstruction, bronchial stricture, 
bronchopleural fistula, chest wall pain, frac ture, changes in pulmonary function tests (see 
below), pulmonary fibrosis, radiation skin c hanges, including dermatitis from radiation, 
alopecia, dyspnea, fever, fatigue, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, chest pain – cardiac, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], heart failure, myocardial infarction, paresthesias.  All of these toxicities will 
be graded based on CTCAE 4.0 (Appendix III) 
6.8.2 Lung Injury: Radiation pneumonitis is a s ubacute (weeks to months from treatment) 
inflammation of the end bronchioles and alv eoli. Patients reporting symptoms as above 
will be promptly evaluated and treated. Mild  radiation pneumonitis may be treated with 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or ster oid inhalers. More significant pneumonitis 
will be treated with systemic steroids, bronc hodilators, and pulmonary toilet. It is unlikely 
that symptomatic pneumonitis will occur during the weeks radiation is actually delivered 
to the patients. However, if a patient ex periences pneumonitis before completing therapy, 
therapy will be put on hold until symptoms re solve.  All patients who have pneumonitis 
will be graded and documented 
6.8.3 Bronchial Injury (e.g., br onchial obstruction; bronchial st ricture; bronchopleural fistula): 
Focal collapse of lung secondary to bronchial injury may impair overall pulmonary status. 
It also makes further assessment of tumor response more difficult as the collapsed lung approximates the treated tumor. Because at electatic lung and tumor have similar imaging 
characteristics, radiology reports will often describe the overall process as progressive 
disease while the actual tumor may be stable or shrinking.  
6.8.[ADDRESS_273182] Wall Pain and/or Fracture (Rib):  Some patients will experience chest wall pain 
either as a result of intercostal neuropathy  or rib fracture. Focal radiation induced 
osteoporosis can result in both occult and obvious rib fractures generally propagated by 
[CONTACT_227140]/sneezing epi[INVESTIGATOR_227122]/ The pain typi[INVESTIGATOR_227123].  
6.8.5 Changes in Pulmonary Function Tests: Pati ents enrolled to this study may have some 
degree of impaired pulmonary function as measured by [CONTACT_83503] (PFTs), including Forced Expi[INVESTIGATOR_1814] 1 se cond (FEV1), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), 
and Diffusing Capacity for Carbon Monoxide (DLC O).  In order to monitor changes in 
lung function from baseline, a protocol-specif ic toxicity classification for PFTs has been 
developed for use with this study. PFTs will be coded for all patients in both treatment 
groups using this scale. The RTOG Pulmonary F unction Test Toxicity Scale is below.  
PFT acquisition, however, is suggested and not required for this study.

11.3 Measurement of Response 
11.3.1 Baseline Documentation of Target lesions  
All treated tumors (GTV1-5) should be identif ied as the target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline and with each follow-up imaging evaluation. The longest diameter 
(LD) for the target lesion will be calculat ed from the treatment planning CT scan using 
pulmonary windowing and reported as the baseline LD.  For follow-up assessment, diagnostic CT scans pulmonary windows are pref erred as the method of evaluation for 
response.  Cases in which it is indetermi nate whether consolidation represents residual 
tumor or treatment effect, it should be assumed that abnormalities are residual tumor 
11.3.2 Evaluation of Target and Involved Lobe Lesions  
Complete 
Response(CR) Disappearance of the target lesion; idea lly, this determination will be made based on 
CT image evaluation. 
Partial Response(PR) At least a 30% decrease in the LD of the target lesion, taking as reference the 
baseline LD; ideally, this determination will be made based on CT image evaluation. 
Stable Disease  (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR/PR above nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for LE below, taking as reference the smallest LD since the treatment started 
Local Enlargement(LE) At least a 20% in crease in the LD of target lesion, taking as reference the smallest LD 
recorded since the treatment started; I deally, this determination will be made based 
on CT image evaluation. 
Primary Tumor Failure  (PTF) Refers to the primary treated tumor after protocol therapy and corresponds to meeting 
both of the following two criteria: 1) Increase in tumor dimension of 20% as defined above for local enlargement (LE); 2) The measurable tumor with criteria meeting LE should be avid on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with uptake of a similar intensity as the pretreatment staging PET, OR the measurable tumor should 
be biopsied confirming viable carcinoma. For outcome analysis, Marginal Failures (MF; see below) will also be counted as P TF; however, they should be distinguished 
specifically as MF, not PTF, on all r eport forms. The EORTC criteria for post-
treatment PET evaluation will be used as a basis  for evaluation in cases more difficult 
to assign as to whether the uptake is  pathological for cancer recurrence vs. 
inflammation.46 
Marginal Failure (MF) Refers to the appearance afte r protocol therapy of a measurable tumor appearing 
since treatment within 1.0 cm of the tr eated PTV (see Section 6.4) and meeting the 
following two criteria: 1) Enlarging tumor dimensions corresponding to a 20% increase 
in the longest diameter compared to initial appearance on imaging evaluation. Ideally, this determination will be made based on CT  image evaluation; 2) The measurable 
tumor within 1.0 cm of the treated PTV should be avid on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with uptake of a similar intensity as the pre-treatment staging PET, OR the measurable tumor should be biopsied confirming viable carcinoma. 
Primary Tumor Control  The abs ence of Primary Tumor Failure. 
IIT-Bedi-SBRT v2-24-17 
 15  (PTC) 
Involved Lobe Failure Refers to the appearance of lung canc er after protocol therapy within the anatomical 
boundaries of the lobe in which the primary tumor arose (involved lobe). The 
measurable tumor apart from the primary tumor but within the involved lobe should meet criteria for LE, should be avid on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging 
with uptake highly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_147503] (e.g., SUV>3-5), OR the measurable tumor 
should be biopsied confirming viable carcinom a. Failure outside of the involved lobe 
(uninvolved lobes) will be considered metastatic disseminated (distant) failures. Local Failure Refers to either primary tumor failure or involved lobe failure or both. 
Local Control  (LC) The absence of Local Failure 
 
 
12. DATA COLLECTION 
 
12.1. Study Design:   
This is a non-randomized Phase II p ilot protocol to determine the f easibility, toxicity, and disease 
control (overall and progression-free survival ) using SBRT in patients with pulmonary 
oligometastatic disease from soft tissue sarcoma primaries. 
  
12.2. Primary Endpoint:   The primary aim of this study is to assess toxici ty and quality of life from SBRT.  All patients will 
be followed for the primary endpoint for a minimum of [ADDRESS_273184] there will be minimal toxicity, both ac ute and long term. Adverse event rates will be 
compared at specific time points (3, 6 and 12 mont hs after completion of SBRT).  Quality of life 
will be measured with the FACT-L questionnaire (Appendix IV). 
 
12.3. Secondary Endpoint :   
The secondary objective of this study is to assess local and regional control, progression-free 
survival and overall survival. Local and regional  recurrence will be defined for each lesion per 
criteria in section 11.3.[ADDRESS_273185] follow-up. Patients will be 
followed for disease-free survival for a minimum of 3 years.  
 
12.4. Endpoint Analysis :   
Crude rates of locoregional recurrences will be documented as well as the time to development 
of recurrence or relapse.  Time of last follow-up or death will also be noted.  This will allow us to 
calculate progression free and overall survival rates.   
 
  
13.0 Statistical Considerations 
13.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINTS: Assess the acute and late toxicity of SBRT for < 5 pulmonary metastases 
from soft tissue sarcoma. 
13.1.1 Toxicity for various sub-sites are based on the CTC v 4.0 scale (see Appendix III) 
13.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS:  Local and regional control, QoL, and overall survival (see Section 12 
and Appendix IV)

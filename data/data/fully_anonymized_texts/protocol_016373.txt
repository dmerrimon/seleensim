D.  Aims 2 & [ADDRESS_1013334], funded by [CONTACT_33230] -Center ed Outcomes Research Institute , will determine if  group  
concept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  (GCM) , a structured brainstorming process, is a comprehensive and efficient method of 
identifying outcomes that are important to patients by [CONTACT_741157] -on-one interviews (the  "gold 
standard").  The overarching objective of this methodology study is to provide high quality evidence to 
researchers, clinicians and policy makers about two methods used to elicit patient preferences for outcomes in order to inform best -practices for  designing patient -centered research studies.  
Aim 1: To engage patients to identify their own patient- important outcomes for managing their chronic 
conditions through 1) one -on-one interviews and 2) concept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_741110].  
 Aim 2: To compare the comprehens iveness of concept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_741111] -on-one interviews for identifying  
patient- important outcomes for managing their chronic conditions.  
 Aim 3: To compare the efficiency of concept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_741111] -on-one interviews for identifying patient 
important outcomes f or managing their chronic conditions.  
 B. Primary Outcomes  
 Primary outcome s:  
1. Comprehensiveness of interviews as compared to one concept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] g roup 
2. Comprehensiveness of interviews as compared to three concept m appi[INVESTIGATOR_007] g roups 
3. Comprehensiveness of concept m appi[INVESTIGATOR_741112] : Efficiency of interviews compared to GCM  
 
C. Timeline and key milestones  
 
Project time line: January 1 , 2016- December 31, 2018.  
 
Year  1:  All training and interview activities will occur during the first year of the project.  
Year 2 : Final interview analysis and concept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_741113].   
Year 3 : Abstract preparation will and dissemination of the results will occur in the final year 
of the project.

ii. Metadata  
Metadata are d ocumentation for your data set. The VOICe project metadata includes the Patient Tracker in 
RED Cap. 
  
iii. Access  
The research team —including PAKSAB members, students and others added as key personnel, will have 
access to study data as outlined in the IRB -approved protocol (15G.667 ). All research pers onnel  must follow 
the data security steps outlined in section v. New research team members must be added to the study IRB vi a 
a new personnel amendment (http://www.jefferson.edu/u niversity/human_research/forms.html ) prior to 
viewing or collecting any study data.  
 iv. Data sharing  
Research team members should discuss any data sharing requests with the PIs prior to sharing any procedural documents, data, or analytic study material s. Any data sharing must comply with the data security procedures 
below.  
 v. Data security and IRB compliance  
Research personnel will follow the data entry, storage and security procedures outlined in the interview and concept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_325951] , as well as  the general guidance provided by [CONTACT_1201].  
 
According to the IRB, t he following steps must be taken to ensure identifiable data remains confide ntial and 
secure:  
a. If an individual is a Jefferson patient and research subject, a separate medical record must be 
maintained apart from any records required for the research.  
b. There are [ADDRESS_1013340] not contain any of the identifiers (also see OHR -[ADDRESS_1013341] of identi fiers).  
c. When not in use, identifiable data should be stored in a locked cabinet or desk in a locked room.  
d. Access to the data should be limited.  Only the individuals who need the data should have access.  
e. If hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_741126], a locked container such as a banker bag should be used.  The container should be marked with instructions for returning the container if misplaced.  
f. If hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_741127], there must be a contract in place which  specifies 
the method of doing this.  The data should be placed in one envelope inside of another envelope. Both envelopes should have tamper -evident seals and should be addressed to the specific recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  
Signatures should be required for receipt, or lo ckable mailboxes should be used.  
VOICe Study Procedures Man ual V.[ADDRESS_1013342]  documents on a secure Jefferson computer.  
 PCORI requires that “financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and other records relevant 
to this  Contract and performance under it must be retained by [CONTACT_741161][INVESTIGATOR_492410] a period of five (5)  
years from the a) Contract Term Date, b) date of the final payment under this Contract, or c)  
conclusion of any audit or litigation related to this Contract, whichever is later.”  
 
VOICe Study Procedures Man ual V.[ADDRESS_1013343] in three different settings, with individual protocols listed separately 
below. Financial remuneration, interview time tracking and data entry and storage will be similar in all settings 
and outlined in Sec tion D (page 15). 
 
A. Jefferson Emergency Department Interview Protocol  
 A i. ED overview, triage process and patient flow  
Patients can enter the Emergency Department in several ways:  
1. Patients can come into the emergency department though the main entrance into the waiting room.  
• First they are “intaked”, which is a mini -registration process.  
• Then they are triaged by [CONTACT_741162].  
• Then they are registered.  
• Patients wait until they are called into a room or hallway bed in the ED.  
2. Patients can c ome into the ED through “Fire Rescue” and are taken directly to the center desk.  
• First they are evaluated by [CONTACT_741163].  
• Then they are taken  into a room or  brought to a  hallway bed.  
• A nurse  registers them.  
• Then they receive formal  triage  
3. Patients can come into the emergency department and go straight into the Trauma Bay where they are actively worked on by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_33717].  
4. After  patients are in rooms (or hallway beds) and have been seen by [CONTACT_741164] : 
• Discharged home.  
• Placed in  the Observation  Unit.  
• Admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
• Transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_741128].  
 
A ii. Screening process  
Screening will take place during a random selection of days and times o f day to ensure that we capture the full 
range of ED patients. S taff interviewer s will sign up for three -hour shift s scattered on different days and at 
different times of day : morning, afternoon, evening, and night. E ach PAKSAB interviewer will complete a 
minimum of two ED interviews.  The research team will screen for eligible patients through the electronic 
medical record system . The research team uses a random generator to determine which patient to approach 
for enrollment, and will consult with the atten ding physician and nurse to determine the best time to 
approach the patient for enrollment.

             order  
• Patient in polic e custody or currently incarcerated individual  
• Patient who has, in their clinician's best judgment, major communication barriers such as visual  
or hearing impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed 
consent  
 
After in itial explanation of what the study is about, the research team will review an additional screening form 
to ensure exclusion criteria will not prevent them from participating in the study.  The interviewer should 
document in the One Drive  Excel sheet when p atients a) initially appear eligible but are then found to be 
ineligible or b) decline participation, and list the reason for ineligibility/refusal.  The interviewer  will also 
document the reason for ineligibility/refusal along with demographic information (gender, age, race, and  
ethnicity) to assess for selection bias.  
 
A iii. Scheduling process  
Interviews of patients in the acute care setting will be performed in -person in a private space within the ED at 
a time that is convenient for the patient and lea st disruptive to their care. This may be the patient room, the 
family room, or an ED doctor’s  office.  Interviewers will assign a study ID to each participant (ED participant 
ID numbers are in the 200’s).  A iv. Consent process  
Prior to the interview, the research team member will conduct an informed consent discussion. By [CONTACT_741165] (and when appropriate, to the patient’s clinician), the research team member will confirm that the patient has the current mental status and capacity to provide informed consent for this study.  
 
Obtaining  consent will occur in a private setting. The research team member will inform the patient of the 
nature of the study, the study purpose, the study procedures, the risks, and the alternatives to participation, 
including the alternative to not participate. Potential participants will be given time to read the consent form and ask questions before making their decision. The research team member will verbally confirm that each interested patient understands the risks, p urpose, procedure, and nature  of the study  before asking for  
consent.  
 Patients who are interested will complete the informed consent discussion and may then decline or consent to 
participation in writing on an IRB -approved Informed Consent with HIPAA Authorization Form, prior to 
any further data collection.  Participants will be given a copy of the informed consent form; the original will 
be kept on file in the research office.  
 Patients  who are unable or prefer not to provide informed consent cannot be enrolled in this study.  
 A v. Interview process  
Researchers will conduct the interview following the interview guide. Interviews will generally last about 30 
minutes and will be recorded using two  recording devices simultaneously.

Interviews should be don e towards the end of an ED visit or after being discharged. Interviewer will check in 
with both attending doctor AND nurse to see when is an appropriate time to do the interview during patient’s ED visit (can it be done during the visit without interfering  or prolonging the visit?).  
 After the interview is completed, researchers will ask the participants to complete the demographic form.  
Interviewers will then log the assigned study ID number and interview date in the study log.    vi. Financial Remuneratio n, Time Tracking, and Data Entry and Storage

informed consent, either in dividually or in small group s. The research team member will inform 
the patient of the nature of the study, the study purpose, the study procedures, the risks, and the alternatives to participation, including the alternative to not participate. Potential participants will be given time to read the consent form and ask questions before making their decision. The research team member will verbally confirm that each interested patient understands the risks, purpose, procedure, and nature of the study before co mpleting the consent discussion. Patients 
who are interested will consent to participation in writing on an IRB -approved i nformed  consent

 with HIPAA Authorization Form, prior to any further data collection.  Participants will be given 
a copy of the informed consent form; the original will be kept on file in the research office.  
The study team should collect demographic and W -9 forms, and check them for completion.  
2. Introduction: Start the session with PowerPoint introduction, then give the prompt.  Optional : 
Allow for 5 -10 minutes of written br ainstorming :  
 
Concept Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_741143] “Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research study. As we explained in the consent 
form, there are two parts to this study, which will happen on two separate days.  This 
morning we’ll be doing the first activity, and then this afternoon we will do the second part. For this morning we are going to be brainstorming -  Brainstorming is a way we can get 
variety of ideas from a group of people – you! In a few moments, I w ill state the question we 
will use for this brainstorming session. Then, I will give you a few minutes to write your ideas, your answers to the question, on paper. Then I will ask you to share out loud any and all ideas that you think of. Don’t worry about  repeating something that has already been said 
or saying something similar to what has already been said. There are no right answers or wrong answers.  
 Two of my colleagues have joined us today and they will be writing down all of the responses that are said out loud.  
 Are there any questions before we start?  
 In the past, medical research has often focused on asking doctors what they think is most important in improving health care for their patients, but we have realized that patients may have different priorities and objectives when they seek health care. Today we would like to know what things patients think about when deciding whether their diabetes treatment has been successful. It can be anything patients consider important, including little things  that 
matter on a day to day basis or things that patients might want to happen in the long term.  
We hope to use this information to improve the delivery of health care and prioritize the concerns patients tell us are important them.  
So with this in mind, the question I’d like to ask is: You are here as a person with diabetes; when people with diabetes seek care, what are th ey hopi[INVESTIGATOR_741144]?”  
 The moderator begins the discussion.  As the responses are listed, the moderator dictates responses t o the recorder, and the recorder types them into a list that is projected in front of 
all of the participants.  Responses are collected until the sess ion reaches theme saturation.   
3. After the session, the team members clarify all of the items on the list to ensure that they are written in a consistent format. In the GCM software , make sure that brainstorming is active (under project 
settings) and upload the list as a text (txt) file into the software.  
       4 .  The Excel spreadsheet will then be uploaded t o the Concept Systems Global Software and “sort      
            cards” will be generated. These cards  each  contain one statement generated from the brainstorming                                                    
 session , and will be loaded into the Concept Systems Global Software for the second session.  
5. Two individuals should set up lunch towards the end of Session 1.

with the guest information. E xplain the sorting  process to the group using the example sheet /slides 
then explain the rules and hand them a set of the rules to keep with them.  After everything has been sorted, show them how to name [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_108726].  
2. Explain the rating system. Participants will rate items in res ponse to these questions:  
• How important is thi s goal to you personally when thinking about your diabetes care?  
• How achievable is this goal for you personally?  
3. 3-[ADDRESS_1013365] the participant name [INVESTIGATOR_354240] # next to the number of the ClinCard  that they were given.  If 
the DOB was not collected on  the demographics form, make sure it is collected here.  Make sure to 
specify when the card will be activated to the participant.  
5. After the second session, uncheck the sorting and rating options and check the analysis options in the software (on the projec t settings screen) to start the data analysis phase.  ** ONCE YOU

 V. Data Analysis and Dissemination  
A. Overview  
Data analysis will be done in consultation with the VOICe Research Advisory Council (RAC). The RAC  will 
be composed of  three PhD -trained researchers and  two PAKSAB  members who have already agreed to be 
representatives on this council.  
 
B. Interview analysis  
We will use a conventional content analysis approach for the analysis of the semi -structure d interviews with 
the purpose  of classifying the interview text into distinct categories that represent similar meanings  and 
allowing themes to emerge from the data. [CONTACT_741194]  will oversee this analysis, and work with a coding team 
of four  others ( Project  Coordinator, Research Ass istant, and 2 PAKSAB member s) to train them for coding 
interviews. The coding team will meet regularly  during this process with the co -PIs to discuss codes and ideas 
that arise during coding.  
 Each transcript will be labeled with the participant’s demographic and illness characteristics as well as the location along the care continuum at which the data were collected (acute, post -acute, primary care) and the 
mode of data collection (phone, in person). Transcripts from the same care  continuum location will be 
analyzed together . Transcripts will be coded by [CONTACT_741175] a content analysis 
approach to identify thematic clusters within each set of care continuum location. Once data are coded, we will use the query f unction in NVivo to sort the data by [CONTACT_741176].  
 C. Concept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_741150], with initial thematic clusters ge nerated by [CONTACT_741177]. Each CM group will include participants from all three locations on the care continuum (acute, post -acute, primary care), thus generating three final sets of lo cation -agnostic themes.  
 D. Aims 2 & 3 analysis  
For Aims 2 & 3, we are comparing the comprehensiveness and efficiency of interviews and concept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 Our comparative analysis will start out with overall comparisons  in which final thematic clusters fr om each of 
the three location -specific interview groups will be compared to the thematic clusters generated by [CONTACT_741178]. This comparison will be a descriptive assessment of the presence/absence of each interview theme in the CM list. We will repo rt proportions of the themes from each interview setting that were 
contained in the CM list as well as a detailed listing of each theme and in which lists it was present. Upon completion of this analysis, outputs from all three concept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_741151].  
 
We will then work with the RAC to study patterns in our data that emerge by [CONTACT_20998], participant characteristics, mode of data collection,  and any other categories as identified by [CONTACT_741179]. These analyses will be operationalized with the use of matrices and other data display techniques to study the potential contributions of these various characteristics to the outcomes identified within the proposed study. For example, a matrix of thematic clusters in columns and  features of individuals 
(acute, post -acute, and primary care) in rows will allow us to explore consistencies and divergences in the data 
which are associated with these non -method based descriptors.  
 The efficiency of each method will be assessed by [CONTACT_741180]. We will determine the resource intensiveness for completion of a single concept mapp ing iteration 
through to completion, and for one set of inter views performed to saturation. The efficiency will be 
calculated based on the time required of  research team  and cost to conduct method . 
 
VOICe Study Procedures Man ual V.6 
25 
 We will also assess potential selection bias in who enrolled in interviews versus concept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_741152] (gender, race, ethnicity, and age) , and will assess on an on -going 
basis and at the end of the study how the enrolled patients compare to those who declined enr ollment 
between the two groups. If we identify any systematic differences between the two groups, we will assess with 
our PAKSAB and our RAC how the difference(s) could have affected the thematic results obtained relative 
to the thematic results that we wo uld have obtained.  
 
E.  Presentation and manuscript preparation  
Staff will maintain lists of upcoming conferences for presentation submissions. We anticipate presenting study findings annually. We plan to submit at least one manuscript based on interview findings (target date 
12/31/17) and one based on concept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (target date 6/30/18).

 Page 14 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
This document is a protocol for a Phase 3 human research study. This study is to be 
conducted according to [LOCATION_002]  and international standards of Good Clinical 
Practice (Food and Drug Administration  Title 21 part 312 and International Council for 
Harmonis ation guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional 
research policies and procedures.  
1.1 BACKGROUND  
The essential features of social anxiety disorder (SAD) are defined as intense,  marked 
and persistent fear of social or performance situations, in which the subject believes 
embarrassment , humiliation, judgement, or rejection  could occur as a consequence of 
exposure to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by [CONTACT_897148] (e.g., public speaking) situation . The anxiety or fear resulting from the 
social or performance situation is profound. The avoidance, fear, or anxious 
anticipation of these situations interferes significantly with the person’s daily routine, 
having a marked  impact  on occupational functioning and social  life. The disorder has a 
lifetime  prevalence estimated  at up to 13%, with onset typi[INVESTIGATOR_897135]-teens  or 
earlier,  and it is diagnosed slightly  more frequently in females than in males. Social 
anxiety tends to be a chronic disorder with periods  of exacerbation,  and a reported  mean  
duration of illness  of approximately 20 years .[1, 2 ]   
Two subtypes of social  anxiety  are described in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, 5th Edition: (i) social  anxiety  (formerly  called  generalized subtype) 
in which fear and avoidance extend to a wide range of social situations, and (ii) 
performance subtype only, in which the subject fears only one or a few circumscribed situations.  Public s peaking is by [CONTACT_897149].
[1]  
Social anxiety disorder has a lifetime comorbidity rate of approximately 81% with 
other psychiatric disorders (particularly affective disorders, other anxiety disorders, 
and substance abuse disorders),  as well as being associated  with increased  
non-psychiatric medical  difficulties.  People with SAD  identify themselves as 
struggling with social impairment, inadequate social support, overall role impairment, specific impairment in education, work, and other activities, as well as interference in their efforts at self -improvement. Unfortunately, for these subjects, there is a strong 
[ADDRESS_1257698] commonly recognized and treated mental 
disorders.[1, 2]  
Current treatments  for SAD include both psychosocial and pharmacologic measures. 
Psychosocial treatments include exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. 
Pharmacological measures vary widely and include antidepressants ( monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] ), benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], beta-blockers, and alpha -2-delta 
voltage gated calcium channel modulators.   
1.1.[ADDRESS_1257699] neural connections to the limbic system without a relay in the thalamus. Therefore, the limbic amygdala is the only brain structure that receives rapid afferent neural in puts from peripheral nasal 
chemosensory receptors .
[3, 4] Chemical cues acting on nasal chemosensory neurons 
trigger sensory inputs that reach the limbic amygdala through a rapid (oligosynaptic) neural path.  
The relevance of the olfactory system in behavior is revealed by [CONTACT_897150] ,
[5, 6] 
and the development of anxiety and depression in humans with congenital anosmia .[7, 8]  
Stimulation of human olfactory chemosensory cells with primary odors produces olfactory awareness via the main olfactory neural circuits ,
[9, 10] but in humans 
chemosensory cues also engage nasal chemosensory receptors and induce behavioral and neuroendocrine responses, without olfactory awareness.
[11-16]  
In most mammals, odorless chemosignals induce activation of accessory olfactory 
neural circuits .[17-22]  
However, some mammals including humans do not have an accessory olfactory system, 
and there are instead neural connections arising in nasal chemosensory neurons that connect with a subset of neurons in the main olfactory bulb. These main olfactory bulb  
neurons in turn project directly to the cortical and the medial amygdala and trigger an 
[ADDRESS_1257700] inhibitory GABAergic neural circuits in the central 
amygdala involved in the modulation  of fear and anxiety .[21-26 ] 
These olfactory -limbic neural circuits play an important role in social behavior and 
emotions.[11-13, 19, 27, 28] The independent sensory contribution of the olfactory system 
projections to the limbic amygdala on social behavior has been also confirmed in molecular biology/behavioral studies, in studies using knockout mouse l ines with loss 
of function in different zones of the olfactory bulbs ,
[20] in human f unctional magnetic 
resonance imaging  studies,[12, 29] in clinical stu dies in human subjects wi th isolated 
congenital anosmia,[7, 30] and in subjects with congenital hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism.[31] 
It has been suggested that olfactory receptor repertoires differ significantly across 
species .[32] Since these receptors have diff erent roles in different behaviors ( e.g., social 
behavior, fear, reproductive behavior) the rapid evolutionary divergences may have 
contributed to behavior differentiation and speciation. Therefore, the action of chemosignals on nasal chemosensory neurons differs significantly across species .
[33-35] 
Pherines are a family of synthetic neuroactive steroid molecules that engage specifically  with human nasal chemosensory receptors .  Pherines stimulate receptor  
neurons in the human  nasal chemosensory epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]
[14, 36] that activate olfactory bulb 
neurons and in turn trigger neural circuits in the limbic amygdala. This leads to 
activation of the anterior gyrus, hypothalamus, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and 
it is different from the brain areas activate d by [CONTACT_897151].[12, 29] Pherines 
are odorless , and brain activation by [CONTACT_897152][12, 
14] and can modulate brain autonomic  and psychophysiologic response.[11, 13, 15, 29, 37-39] 
1.2 STUDY RATIONALE  
PH94B (3β-androsta-4,16- dien-3-ol) is a synthetic neuroactive steroid discovered and 
initially developed at Pherin Pharmaceuticals that targets human nasal chemosensory 
cells[11, 36] and has been demonstrated in Phase [ADDRESS_1257701] benefits for the 
acute treat ment of SAD.[40] 
Pherines induce calcium ion  entry in human nasal chemosensory neurons.[37, 41] 
Pherines such as PH94B target G-protein- coupled receptor  chemosensory receptors 
that are expressed in hu man nasal chemosensory neurons.[32, 42] 
[ADDRESS_1257702] currents 
in a concentration -dependent and reversible fashion.[43] These membrane currents are 
carried by [CONTACT_897153] .[41]  
 
  
 
   
 
      
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_1257703] had similar population and efficacy endpoints of Protocol PH94B -CL026. These double- blind, randomized, 
placebo -controlled Phase 2 clinical studies (PH94B -CL016 and -CL022), included a 
total of 91 female subjects who met criteria for SAD  (generalized subtype) as defined 
by [CONTACT_9288] -4. PH94B (1.6 µ g) was administered i.n. in spray form  prior 
to both a performance (public speaking) challenge and a social interaction challenge 
simulation which took place at the clinical sites.  
The primary outcome measures were t he Clinical Global 
Impression Scale of Improvement (CGI -I) and the Subjective Units of Distress Scale 
(SUDS). SUDS scores range from zero to 100, with higher scores indicating greater levels of anxiety.   Subjects receiving PH94B were more likely than those  who received 
placebo to show improvement on the CGI -I following treatment. In the PH94B group, 
34 of 45 subjects (75.6%) were rated very much less anxious or much less anxious 
compared to only 17 of 46  subjects (37%) in the placebo group. A test for the difference 
between proportions indicated a Z value of 4.03, p  = 0.0001 (Fisher’s exact test).  
During the public speaking challenge, subjects randomized to PH94B (n = 45) showed an improvement of 26.7 points in the mean score on the SUDS at Visit 3 (initial 
treatment visit) as compared to Visit 2  (baseline visit, at which all subjects received 
placebo) . In comparison, subjects randomized to placebo (n = 46) showed an 
improvement of only 14.0 in the mean SUDS score across visits. The PH94B group’s improvement from Visit 2 to Visit 3  significantly exceeded the placebo group’s 
[ADDRESS_1257704]’s response to the anxiety -provoking situation between Visit 2 and Visit 3 as 
measured by [CONTACT_139800]-I.

 Page 30 4.2.2 Treatment Regimen  
IP will be administered once in each nostril before each public speaking challenge . Men 
and women will be treated with the same dose of PH94B: 3.2  µg.  
 
 Therefore, the spray volume administered to each nostril 
(100 µL) will be below the nasal retention volume and will be retained in the nasal 
passages.  
 
 
 
  
4.[ADDRESS_1257710] be performed, and a drug receipt 
log filled  out and signed by [CONTACT_897159]. It is important that the 
designated S tudy staff counts and verifies that the shipment contains all the items noted 
in the shipment inventory. Any damaged or unusable IP in a given shipment (active 
drug or comparator) will  be documented in the S tudy files.   
4.3.2 Storage 
  
 Access should be 
restricted to the designated responsible member/s of the Investigator’s staff and to the 
clinical monitor . The Investigator agrees that neither he/she nor any of the Study staff 
will supply IP to any person other than subjects  enrolled in the Study.  
[ADDRESS_1257711].  
 
   
Current and accurate inventory and dispensing records will be kept for all IP, and upon 
Study completion a final inventory of all clinical supplies will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602]. All IP 
containers, whether empty or containing unused IP, will be returned per the S ponsor ’s 
instructions from the clinical monitor . A copy of the Drug Receipt Form and the Drug 
Accountability Form will be retained in the Investigator’s files.  
4.[ADDRESS_1257712] during the month prior to 
Screening (Visit 1) should be recorded in the eCRF. With the exception of those noted 
in the protocol (refer to Section  3.2.2, Exclusion Criteria)  all medications  (prescription 
or over-the-counter) that were started prior to Screening may be continued during the 
course of the trial. During the course of the Study, subjects should stay on stable doses 
of their usual allowable medication regimens. Medications for treatment of minor 
concurrent illnesses that arise after Screening may be allowed at the discretion of the 
Investigator, with the exception of the prohibit ed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_897136]. 
In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is administered, it is essential that subjects  be instructed  not to take any medication  (either  self-administered  
non-prescription drugs or prescription therapy prescribed by [CONTACT_20427]) without 
prior consultation with the Investigator.  The Investigator should examine the 
acceptability  of all concomitant medications  not explicitly prohibited. Sites should 
[ADDRESS_1257713] the Medical Monitor when uncertain about the acceptability of concomitant 
medications. All concomitant medication taken during the Study will be recorded on 
appropriate pages of the eCRF.  
Where washout of prohibited medications  is required before B aseline (Visit 2) , tapering  
rates  are at the discretion of the Investigator and are to be determined on an individual 
basis, with consideration to subject state, dose, and known PK of the medication being discontinued. The subject must be consented before any tapering is started.  
With the exception of eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123], ramelteon, melatonin, zaleplon, zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], or 
anti-histamines as allowable concomitant medications for the treatment of insomnia, 
no other psychotropic medication besides IP is permitted to  be used  by [CONTACT_897160] (Visit 1) and Follow -up (Visit 4). At Visit 1, the investigator should 
consider check ing the local Prescription Drug Monitoring Database to verify the lack 
of use of scheduled central nervous system active drugs, such as benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].

5.2.1 Visit 1  (Screening ) 
Screening begins after the written informed consent has been obtained. The purpose of 
the screening phase is to:  
• Ensure that appropriate subjects are entered into the trial; 
• Determine that the subject meets all eligibility  criteria; 
• Collect  demographic and medical  data permitting  characterization  of the subject ; 
• Ensure that prohibited medications are  discontinued; and  
• Determine that subjects are willing to undertake up to two anxiety -provoking 
situations  at the site . 
To meet these objectives, the duration of screening must be tailored to the individual subject and may last from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 35 days. Subjects 
continuing to meet all eligibility requirements at Baseline (Visit 2) will undergo a 
Visit [ADDRESS_1257714] (PH94B and placebo), required visits and scheduling, and asked whether they 
wish t o participate. All subjects agreeing to participate must give written informed 
consent using the IRB -approved informed cons ent form (ICF) before any study- related 
procedures are performed  (including tapering of prohibited medications) . The ICF will 
be signed and dated by [CONTACT_897161], and 
a copy of the signed ICF will be given to the subject. The informed c onsent process 
will be documented in the source records for each subject.  
After the ICF process is complete, a subject number will be allocated by [CONTACT_779], by [CONTACT_897162]. Subject numbers will be four- digit numbers beginning with the site number. Subject numbers will not be 
sex-specific and will be assigned sequentially in the order in which the ICF is signed, 
and the Screening (Visit 1) occurs.

5.3.1 Public Speaking Challenge  
The public speaking c hallenge has been used in previous studie s as an 
anxiety -provoking situation and has been designed to be consistently applied across all 
clinical sites.  
 
 
 
5.3.2 Subjective Units of Distress Scale 
The Subjective Units of Distress Scale  (SUDS) , used at Visit 2 and Visit 3 as part of 
each public speaking c hallenge, is scored in the range of 0 to 100 (operationalize d for 
the participants in this study as 0  = totally relaxed or no anxiety and 100 = most distress 
of anxiety imaginable). It is a standard instrument for rating social and performance 
anxiety in patients with SAD  during role playing situations.   
 
   
 
 
5.3.3 Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale  
The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale ( LSAS ) is a clinician -rated scale that has been 
shown to be sensitive to treatment -related change in social anxiety symptoms. The time 
frame for  rating symptomatology is the past week. The scale consists of 24  items. Each 
item is given two rating s: fear or anxiety  on scale of 0 to 3 and avoidance on a scale of 
0 to 3 with the total maximum overall score of 144. The items in the scale can be 
divided into performance and social interaction items, and corresponding subscores can 
be derived.

 Page 45 The following laboratory tests will be performed on site during the Study: 
• Urine pregnancy test (for all female subjects of child -bearing  potential)  
• Urine Drug  Screen  
The central lab oratory should be used for any unscheduled and follow -up labs, if 
needed.  Additional urine and blood samples  may be collected  for further evaluation  of 
safety  as warranted by [CONTACT_737]’s judgment. 
Results and reports from the central laboratory should be filed with the source 
documents for each subject. The central laboratory will provide laboratory results to 
the Study site as soon as they are available and will be provide d to Sponsor or 
designated data manager with agreed timelines . 
Any laboratory value outside the normal range will be flagged  for the attention  of the 
Investigator, who must indicate whether or not the value is of clinical  significance.  If 
the result of any lab oratory test performed during Screening is clinically significant, 
the subject should not be advanced to Visit 2. However, any abnormal result may be 
repeated to confirm the finding before excluding the subject from potential inclusion in 
the Study. In addition, subjects should be excluded if they have any other  abnormal 
laboratory test at Screening  that, in the Investigator’s judgment, is medically  significant 
in that it would impact the safety of the subject, the conduct of the Study, or the 
interpretation of  the Study results.  
Follow- up/unscheduled laboratory tests may be performed on clinically significant 
abnormalities as indicated  by [CONTACT_737]. Unscheduled laboratory tests may be 
repeated  at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for appropriate medical  care.

 Page 46 6.0 PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ADVERSE  EVENTS AND SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENTS  
6.1 MEDICAL MONITORING  
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator at the site to oversee the safety  of the Study at 
his/her site. This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate 
reporting of SAEs  as noted  below. Medical monitoring will include a regular 
assessment of the number and type of SAEs . 
6.2 DEFINITION S OF ADVERSE EVENT  AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
6.2.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in intensity  during the course of the study. Any newly developed illnesses or 
injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal and is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further dia gnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_897166], a clinical  laboratory abnormality  must  be documented as an AE if any one 
of the following conditions is  met: 
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm 
the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity 
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management, e.g., change of 
dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessme nts, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.  
46

PH94B Nasal Spray  Protocol PH94B-CL026, Version 2.0 
Clinical Trial Protocol   
 
 
 Page 47 A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of 
the condition worsens during the study period (between after IP administration at 
Visit 2 and Visit 4/Follow- Up). 
At Screening  through IP administration at Visit 2, any clinically significant abnormality 
should be recorded as a preexisting condition in the medical history, not as an AE. At the end of the Study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the 
definition of an AE must also be recorded and documented as an AE. 
Pregnancy  is not considered  an AE, but it is an important medical  event , which  must  be 
followed up as described in  Section  6.5.3 . 
6.2.2 Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious. A  serious adverse event ( SAE ) 
is any AE that is:  
• fatal,  
• life-threatening, 
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly 
or birth defect, or an important medical event.  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life-threatening but  
are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject and  may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. For 
example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in- patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bro nchospasm in an emergency department 
would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
AEs that do not meet  any of the criteria  for SAEs  should be regarded as non- serious AEs.

The Investigator is to determine  whether  or not there  is a reasonable  causal  relationship  
between the IP and the AE. Medical judgment should be used to determine the 
relationship, considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal 
relationship, relevant medical history, and confounding factors such as co -medication 
or concurrent  diseas es. 
The relationship assessment for an AE is to be completed by [CONTACT_897167].

 Page 54 8.0 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
8.1 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING  
Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be used to capture Study assessments and 
data.  The Investigator agrees to maintain accurate eCRFs and source documentation as 
part of the case histories.  All eCRFs will be reviewed and source verified by [CONTACT_897169], and the study monitor will ensure that all data in the 
eCRF are correct and complete. Before or between vis its, the Medical Monitor or study 
monitor may conduct a preliminary medical review of the eCRFs. Once the eCRFs are 
completed and source -verified, the investigator must electronically sign all required  
eCRF  pages, verifying the accuracy of all data contained in the eCRF s. 
Training will be provided for the electronic data c apture (EDC) system. All Study staff 
using the EDC system must have the necessary education, training, and experience or any combination of these. The Investigator will be responsible for documenting 
employee education, training, and previous experience that pertain to the EDC system  
for all Study site staff using the EDC system.  
The Investigator must maintain adequate security of the EDC system, including 
documentation that all users have  been trained on the appropriate standard operating 
procedure and a list of authorized users. To ensure all data entries can be tracked, all personnel responsible for data entry must obtain a unique user identification (user ID) and password before any dat a can be entered in the eCRFs. Authorized S tudy staff  will 
be assigned a unique user ID only after receiving standard operating procedure training.  
If electronic data systems other than those provided and maintained by [CONTACT_120920], the Investigator must ensure that the systems 
are validated,  and that data are backed  up. 
8.2 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The data will be summarized in tables, as appropriate, showing the number of subjects 
with non- missing data (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum 
for continuous data and showing counts and pe rcentage for categorical data. Data will 
also be listed as deemed ap propriate. All statistical analyses will be performed, and 
data appendices will be created by [CONTACT_120921].

[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Estimand  
The treatment of interest is PH94B, 3.[ADDRESS_1257723] is adult patients with SAD as 
defined by [CONTACT_897170] (Section 3.2).  
 
 Intercurrent events  are 
expected t o be rare. Any intercurrent event  that does occur will be handled using the 
treatment policy strategy, i.e., included in the treatment regimen under evaluation. The 
difference of means from Visit  2 to Visit 3 in SUDS will be estimated for each 
treatment gr oup. PH94B will be compared to placebo using differences in group means.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Estimand  
The treatment of interest is PH94B, 3.[ADDRESS_1257724] is adult patients with SAD as 
defined by [CONTACT_897170] (Section 3.2). The endpoint to be measured is the CGI -I score at Visit 3. Intercurrent events are expected to be rare. 
Any intercurrent event that does occur will be handled using the tre atment policy 
strategy, i.e., included in the treatment regimen under evaluation. The proportion of 
subjects with CGI -I scores of 1  or 2  for 
PH94B will be compared to placebo using a comparison of binomial propo rtions. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sensitivity Analyses  
Sensitivity analysis focusing on the assumptions about missing data can be performed 
by [CONTACT_897171]. Details around sensitivity 
analyses will be finalized in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

Towards this goal we will pursue following outcome parameters for  
Phase I:  Feasibility/acceptability assessment:  
Primary outcome parameter:  
• ability to obtain complete on -site data sets from at least 90% of patients 
enrolled (with at least 40% from patients in the app group and at least 40% from patients in the control group).  
Secondary outcome parameters:  
• ability to enroll 60 patients by [CONTACT_4475] 150 after initiation of recruitment in the 
clinic (=day 1)

• anxiety at the end of the waiting room time  
 
Secondary outcome parameters   
• pain the end of the waiting room time 
• anxiety during treatment  
• pain during treatment 
• anxiety during 1 week after treatment  
• pain during 1 week after treatment 
• use of units of sedatives and analgesics during 1 week after treatment  
• patient satisfaction  
 
Design and Outcomes   
The design is a s ingle -blind, placebo controlled clinical trial to test the feasibility of 
the trial design assessing the ability of a Comfort Talk® app to nonpharmacologically reduce anxiety, pain, and periproc edural drug use in individuals [ADDRESS_927194] the hypothesis that listening to a Comfort Talk® app with calmative content reduces pain, anxiety, and post-procedural medication use. 
Eligible patients  at the Craniofacial Pain Center at the Tufts School of Dental 
Medicine (TUSDM) will be randomized to  listen to a tablet containing a calmative 
Comfort Talk® app or app with white noise on an intent- to-treat basis. Their anxiety 
and pain measures will be recorded on validated 0 -10 scales and before listening, at 
the end of the waiting room period, and every 10 minutes (+/ - 2 minutes) while on the 
dental chair.  
All patients will be given a packet with diary c ards to record their levels of anxiety, 
pain, and drug use daily for 7 days after their visit and asked to send those back. 
Subjects will be mailed a $25 check upon returning their diaries. 
Patients randomized to the Comfort Talk® app will receive a download coupon for 
the app before leaving TUSDM, those randomized to the control condition (white noise) will receive a download coupon after they send in their diary cards.  
Interventions and Duration  Approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes (Up to [ADDRESS_927195] up to 45 minutes): 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 7 of 44 Patient will be asked to come in ½ hour early before an already scheduled 
appointment. They will be taken to a private area, report their demographics, and if eligible  consented and fill out a NIDA Quick Screen. 
 The participant will then be verbally asked to indicate his/her pain and anxiety levels on validated 0- 10 scales. The research assistant will then hand the participant a tablet 
containing, depending on the group attribution, either the app (App Group) or white noise (Control Group) and will be shown how to operate the tablet.  
Participant will then return to the clinic waiting area with the tablet and wait for their 
regularly scheduled appointment. The patient will be at liberty to when and for how long to listen.  At the end of the waiting room period the participant will be queried again for their levels of pain and anxiety.   After the participant enters the treatment room, he or she will be able to continue to listen to the app or white noise on the tablet. The research assistant will ask the participant every 10 min (+/ - 2 minutes) to indicate their pain and anxiety levels. The 
research assistant will note the duration of chair time, the amount of lidocaine g iven, 
if any or which other medications were given during the appointment, and whether the dental practitioner prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], prescription or non-prescription drugs at the end of the visit. 
Before leaving home, the participant will be asked to fill out a satisfaction survey 
based on a modified Press Ganey Template. The participant will then receive a diary card on which to note pain, average and maximal pain as well its location, use of non-prescription, prescription, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_162228], use of the app, and be provided pre-stamped envelopes. Patients will be asked to complete the diary daily before bedtime for [ADDRESS_927196] on the average 45 min.  Subjects will be randomized to one of four tablets using a randomization plan generated by [CONTACT_98688] 9.4 PROC PLAN.  Given that four tablets will be avail able 
at one time, four subjects will be randomized per block.  Given a total sample size of 72, subjects will be randomized to 18 blocks.   
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 8 of 44 1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective concerns feasibility/acceptability of the trial design. This will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_684355]-site data sets from at least 90% of 
patients enrolled (with at least 40% from patients in the app group and at least 40% from patients in the control group).  
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives 
Secondary objectives further assess overall feasibility of the trial design and aim to 
obtain sufficient data to assess the ability to calculate reliable sample size requirements for Phase II .   
 Feasibility parameters:  
• ability to enroll 60 patients by [CONTACT_4475] 150 after initiation of recruitment in the clinic 
(=day 1)  
• Obtain 38 packages of filled out diary cards. (at least [ADDRESS_927197] 16 from patients in the control group) 
• 90% of patients in app group listen to app ≥5 min  
 
Since a significant reduction in anxiety in the waiting room is the main ingredient that 
underlies all other hypothesized effects for Phase II outcomes, even in the face of proven technical feasibility of trial execution, it was also taken into consideration for sample size calculations.  
We hypothesize that use of the active Comfort Talk® app results in a reduction in anxiety by 35% at the end of the waiting room time.  This degree of reduction in anxiety is clinically significant based on prior work in a c linical trial that 
demonstrated that a 35% difference in anxiety at the onset of an invasive medical procedure is associated with significant differences in the subsequent experience of pain and anxiety during the procedure, need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_684331], and the overall length of the procedure ( 1). These factors directly affect procedure safety 
and throughput (e.g. economical efficiency). 
Secondary clinical outcome parameters will be:  
• anxiety at the end of the waiting room time  
• pain the end of the waiting room time  
• anxiety during treatment  
• pain during treatment  
• anxiety during 1 week after treatment  
• pain during 1 week after treatment  
• use of units of sedatives and analgesics during 1 week after treatment  
• patient satisfaction  
 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 9 of 44 2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
In the US, >100 Million surgical and >300 Million dental procedures are performed annually 
(2-4). An estimated 20 to 30% of patients fear these procedures, and 8.75% severely so ( 5, 
6). Thus a considerable faction of the population is affected. Some patients don’t keep their appointments, delaying treat ment ( 5, 7-11). Others who present for their procedures are 
distressed in the waiting room (see also 2.2).  
 
Healthcare professionals mainly rely on opi[INVESTIGATOR_684332] ( 12, 13). 
However, even under medical supervision during procedures and with dosages usually well 
tolerated, these drugs can cause cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_684333] ( 14). 
Of concern is the increasing practice of IV sedation in dental offices, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_684334] ( 11). Drugs prescribed to manage pain after discharge feed into the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817]. Every day 80 people die from overdoses, half of them caused by [CONTACT_684356] ( 15). 
 The majority of surgeries are now performed in outpatient settings ( 16). At discharge, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_684335] –nor their patients– know what the patients’ analgesia needs will be during recovery. Ample amounts of opi[INVESTIGATOR_684336] a time-saving solution. Particularly patients who didn’t learn how to deal with potentially painful sensations during general anesthesia then can suddenly find themselves at home unprepared to cope. In one 
study, such patients used 8x the amount of morphine equivalents (23.9 vs 3 mg) their counterparts took who were awake and had to cope during their surgery ( 17). Comfort during 
and after conscious surgery, however, requires well-developed copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] ( 17-20), or 
external guidance therein. Ou r prior large -scale clinical trials showed that guiding patients in 
self-hypnotic relaxation at the onset of invasive medical procedures can provide such copi[INVESTIGATOR_25146]. The results were sustained reductions in pain and anxiety; drug use, complications, procedure time, and cost decreased while satisfaction increased ( 21-24 ). The benefits of such 
live-guided interventions have also been shown by [CONTACT_29091] ( 25-42). Trained 
personnel to provide such services, however, are not widely available. Empowering patients directly with a validated app that they can adjust to their needs in the moment is a desirable alternative.  
 The long-term goal is to provide a vali dated practical means of non -pharmacologic reduction 
of pain, anxiety, and need for post-procedure prescription drugs achieved through a Comfort Talk® app for the patients undergoing these procedures. Our large- scale clinical trials 
showed that short Comfort Talk® scripts spoken live by [CONTACT_684357] a sustained reduction in pain and anxiety ( 21, 22, 24). Also drug use, complications, and procedure time significantly 
decreased while patient satisfaction and operational efficiency increased. Comfort Talk verbiage used live by [CONTACT_684358][INVESTIGATOR_684337] (7). An app that could provide similar 
benefits is highly desirable. While the Comfort Talk® app approach will be applicable to procedures in general, dentistry is chosen as the test environment. Dentistry is not only a 
Protocol Template, Version 1.[ADDRESS_927198] prescriber group of 
addictive drugs.   
 
2.2 Study Rationale 
Scientific Premise  
The app is designed for use by [CONTACT_684359]/dental procedures. After 
choosing the options on the Comfort Talk app, the patient listens to the recording via earphones. Specifically the study will be performed in the dentistry waiting room.  The text content of the Comfort Talk® app is based on clinically- tested scripts which were 
validated in three large -scale, federally -funded, clinical trials with 678 patients in 
randomized sequence and published in peer-reviewed journals ( 21, 22, 24) . Use of these 
scripts with patients at the time they presented for medical procedures was associated with significant reductions in pain, anxiety, need for narcotics and sedatives, and adverse effects. Live use of the script language and wo rd snippets developed in clinical practice by [CONTACT_684360] a multicenter trial encompassing a total of >97,[ADDRESS_927199] snippets was associated with a significant reduction in non-completion 
of scans due to claustrophobia and disruptive patient motion compared to baseline cases without training and use ( 7). In a further randomized trial assessing the effect of training 
personnel in delivery of script elements, trained sites had more efficient patient throughput, a lower no- show rate, greater patient satisfaction, and overall higher patient volume ( 43). 
 Our research showed that being in a waiting room is fraught with considerable distress for a patient based on a study with 214 women who were awaiting either a diagnostic procedure (breast biopsy), invasive embolization of benign uterine fibroids, or a higher risk and invasive chemoembolization of malignant liver cancers ( 44). All three patient groups 
experienced abnormally high mean scores on Perceived Stress, Impact of Event, and Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_684338]. The diagnostic breast biopsy group had the highest anxiety levels which were elevated to an abnormal level. One may conclude that the uncertainty of diagnosis in that case was associated with greater stress than was awaiting more invasive and potentially higher risk treatment. The adverse impact of uncertainty was also borne out in another study that showed that waiting after a biopsy for days without knowing the diagnosis resulted in abnormal stress responses similar to having been informed of a cancer diagnosis, as measured by [CONTACT_684361] ( 45).  
 
In case of uncertainty and ambiguity, the natural mental processing is geared to choose the more negative interpretation, such as pain or danger ( 46, 47). Once a painful stimulus has 
occurred one also tends to be more attentive to external cues that could indicate pain, even when there is none ( 48). Expectancy then further shapes pain-intensity processing in the 
brain ( 49).  
 The mechanism by [CONTACT_684362]-delivered verbiage is postulated to reduce pain and anxiety was elaborated in prior large- scale clinical trials evaluating pr ocedures of varying degrees of 
invasiveness and procedural risk:  outpatient large core breast biopsy performed with local 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 11 of 44 anesthetic only ( 21), vascular and percutaneous renal interventions performed with access to 
IV conscious sedation ( 24), and tumor embolizations performed with conscious sedation 
which are higher risk procedures that induce tissue ischemia ( 22).  
 
Three essential premises underlie the mechanism of action:  
1. Under standard care conditions, acute anxiety and pain increased linearly over time as is evident in Fig. 2-3. The steepness of the pain curve was relatively independent of stimulus severity and medications administered, and was indistinguishable among three types of procedures of vastly different invasiveness and risk ( 50). Time zero on Figs. 2 and 3 was 
patient entry into a procedure suite and initial preparation and positioning. Based on our work in the MRI setting, we speculate that the increase in pain and anxiety also happens when a patient is not instrumented, and thus the length of time becomes the limiting factor in the patient’s intolerance for remaining on the examination table ( 7). 
 
 
Fig. 1 :  Course of pain perception during procedures of widely 
varying invasiveness and potential for pain stimuli (from ( 50)).  
 2.) When patients were read a short 1- 3 minute self -hypnotic relaxation script by [CONTACT_684363], pain no longer increased over time in all three 
trials, even in procedures that lasted hours (Example, Fig. 2) This implies that a fundamental and sustained change in the mode of processing pain and anxiety can be achieved through a short set of suggestions at a time when the patient is exposed to an ambiguous situation and potentially painful stimuli . In cases performed unde r IV 
conscious sedation, patients in the script group also requested and received significantly lower doses of sedatives and narcotics and had more stable vital signs, fewer complications, and shorter procedures times.  
 
 

Protocol Template, Version 1.0 12 of 44 Use of a self -hypnotic relaxation Comfort Talk® script or Comfort Talk snippets of helpful 
suggestions and hypnoidal language also had significant benefits when delivered live by 
[CONTACT_684364]. In a clinical trial with 97,712 patients, incompletion scans due to claustrophobia and disruptive patient motion decreased significantly from 2.3 pre Comfort Talk® training to 1.4% post training, indicating improved patient tolerance ( 7). Two sites in 
this trial (Tufts Medical Center and The Ohio State University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684339]) used this benefit additionally to perform more lengthy and combined procedures.  In a subsequent trial six MRI sites were randomized to receive training in delivery of the language elements provided in the app. in the setting of a saturated market, three sites were trained, three were not. Analysis of 27,425 patient visits showed better patient retention, attendance at examinations, improved throughput and satisfaction with treatment in the trained sites compared to non- trained sites ( 43). 
 Better patient tolerance is also reflected in a current clinical trial, funded by [CONTACT_36164] -SBIR 
R44 AT006296 with 29,772 patients at Duke University MRI. Enabling personnel to deliver the verbiage snippets by [CONTACT_684365] 1.) patients’ use of oral sedatives in the waiting room, 2.) extra time due to patient disruptive motion or claustrophobia, and 3.) MRI study incompletions (Fig. 3 ). 
   
Fig. 2: 1-3 minutes of comforting words (red line) at the onset of renal/vascular procedures 
prevented the naturally occurring increase in anxiety and pain over time under standard care conditions (blue line) and allowed procedures to be completed faster (from ( 24)).

training enabling personnel to deliver verbiage integrated in the Comfort Talk app  
 
3.) Elevated anxiety levels immediately prior to invasive procedures are a predictor of higher anxiety and pain during procedures, need for drugs, and procedure time ( 1). These findings 
concur with reports that identify anticipatory anxiety right before surgery and/or interventions as a predictor of poor patient compliance, greater pain, poorer outcomes, delayed recovery, and maladaptive postoperative behavior ( 1, 18, 51-61). A validated patient 
Comfort Talk® app, that patients can use to assist with copi[INVESTIGATOR_684340], thus promises to not only benefit the patients but also the healthcare professionals and social environment they engage with.  
Administration of Intervention 
The app will be delivered via earphone in the waiting room to patients who are randomized to the test group. A tablet is offered to the patients on an intent- to-treat basis e.g. patients can 
listen as much or little as they wish.  
 
Sample screens are shown  below, as described in the legend for Fig 4. Upon opening the app, 
the user will begin with Figure 1a which is the static Home screen. It has an overview, links 
to the Background and Legal screens, and a Begin bar. Pushing the Begin bar leads to Figure 1b which shows the Selection screen with 4 options (Relaxation, Confidence, Comfort, Peace). When the user pushes one of the selections Figure 1c, the Personalization screen appears. On the Play screen the user has the option to choose among one of four voic es, 
between a long or short version of the script indicated by [CONTACT_684366], and can add Extras to extend the Talk Time. The expected final Talk Time is reflected on the bottom Play bar which also displays the customary player symbols for start, stop, and location indicator of the recordings. Once the user pushes the play symbol the audio delivery starts. The user can stop the play by [CONTACT_684367], repeat, restart with the same or different settings from the Personalization screen, or return to the Selection screen to listen to a different selection. The chosen selections do not auto- repeat.

The shortest combination of listening content is [ADDRESS_927200] of care dental procedures in the TUSDM Craniofacial Pain Center are not increased or affected as a result of participating in this study.  
 Patients who are randomized to one of the control group and who are anxious may be disappointed for not getting the app while waiting.  Because any dental procedure with or without the app can cause increasing anxiety and pain, anxiety and pain will be monitored at frequent intervals with validated 0- 10 verbal assessment 
scales during  their clinic visit. The investigators at the Craniofacial Pain Center at TUSDM are 
furthermore experts in managing patient’s pain and distress and assure (as they do for all their 

Protocol Template, Version 1.0 15 of 44 patients) that they leave with acceptable comfort levels. [CONTACT_684399] and Jackson are furthermore 
psychologically trained and will be able to recognize any unexpected AEs related to participating in the study.  When patients hear drill sounds or had prior traumatic experiences and the environment suddenly reminds them of those the y can vividly relieve the old trauma. This is very rare in a dental setting 
and can occur whether patients would listen to an app or not. A very unlikely risk could conceivably be a scenario in which a person with active multiple personalities or active ps ychotic 
disease that may not have been obvious or known or treated prior to training becomes revealed. In these cases the individual would be evaluated by [CONTACT_684368].  
 
3. STUDY DESIGN

Protocol Template, Version 1.0 16 of 44  
4. Study location: Outpatient clinic at TUSDM  
 5. Enrollment per iod and follow -up time: 
• For individual patients: time of clinic visit data collection on site plus [ADDRESS_927203] 
• For the entire trial: 6 months  
 
6. Description of intervention: The research assistant will hand the participant a ta blet 
containing, depending on the group attribution, either the app (App Group) or white noise 
(Control Group) and will be shown how to operate the tablet.  
Participant will then return to the clinic waiting area with the tablet and wait for their regularly 
scheduled appointment. The patient will be at liberty to when and for how long to listen.  
 
7. Randomization, blinding and any stratification:  
We will use 4 tablets, two  with Comfort Talk ® app, two with white noise, labeled A,B,C,D. The 
tablets will be preloaded with the respective content in a randomized sequence at Hypnalgesics, 
unknown to the Tufts investigators.  [CONTACT_213554]/research assistan t will consent the patients, hand the patient the tablet based on the 
randomization scheme (which will be provided by [CONTACT_6283]. Finkelman and Roomian), obtain baseline data, query and record trial data but  will not analyze  data. There is a possibility that he 
may become unblinded, however he will not share his observations with the analyzing team.  Strict blinding will be maintained for the analyzing team. Analysis of data will be performed by [CONTACT_684369]. Finkelman and Roomian, who will remain blinded  throughout the trial as to 
which tablet contained which content. They will not have any patient interactions and thus also will also not be privy to any accidental unblinding of tablet content during the dental treatment.  8. n/a

The site -PI [INVESTIGATOR_684341].  The site -PI [INVESTIGATOR_684342]/assent following SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -091). Consenting will take place in a private area and the patient will be given as much 
time as he/she needs to consider participation. The participant will be invited to include or exclude any associates (e.g., loved ones) in the consent process. Patients will be asked to read the consent form and given ample opportunity to have their questions answered.  To avoid coercion, the consenting investigator will read through the copy of the consent form with the participant section by [CONTACT_68979], making sure the participant understands each section and has an opportunity to ask questions.  If at any time the participant indicates s/he is not interested in participation, the meeting will end.   
 
Informed consent will be obtained from the subject. The purpose and nature of the study will be reviewed and explained to all potential s ubjects by [CONTACT_779] -Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -
Investigator. The subject will be given a consent form to read, after which they will be asked whether they have any questions. When all questions have been answered to the subject’s satisfaction, they will be asked to sign the consent form should they be willing to participate. A copy of the consent form will be given to each subject. If any new finding requires any change to the informed consent form, the subject will be re-consented. 
 
Non-English speaking subjects will not be enrolled in the study because study staff at this 
time are not certified, prepared, or trained to translate or communicate in any language other than English. The study budget does not allow for the payment of translation services at this time. There are no direct benefits to this population by [CONTACT_4907].  
 
Patients will be given the Tufts University approved consent form. Only adults who can consent for themselves will be enrolled, not those requiring consent from a l egal 
representative for adult patients.  
 
Randomization for Patients 
Four tablets were preloaded by [CONTACT_684370] a randomized sequence that is unknown to the Tufts team to maintain blinding of the site investigators. To sets o f sealed envelopes, numbered from 1-80, are provided to the site investigators. One set 
contains for use of the research assistant contains a card with A,B,C, or D based on the randomization sequence provided by [CONTACT_6283].

 Patients will be given a tablet containing either the app or white noise control content 
during their clinic visit. App patients  will receive a download coupon for the app 
before they leave home and are at liberty to download the app at home to their own devices.  The clinic visit usually last approximately 45 min during which the 
participant can listen to the app or white noise as little or much as he or she desires.

Driven -Development (BDD) to design and implement features that research suggests to be 
effective (1)( http://www.bdd- in-action.com/) . This has been achieved for the prototy pe 
which is functioning according to spec. Design supports data- mining capability of 
anonymized selection preferences and feedback. Technical performance and good development practices were insured through review of code and test results by [CONTACT_684372], and the app stores review and approval process.  
 In accordance with BDD, testing will be continued during the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_684343]. App usage patterns in clinic will be established  electronically through background capture of usage data and upload to the 
database server. This data allows analysis of variables such as options chosen, audio segments played and time spent listening to each segment and in total.  
 A criterion  of success will be that 90% of patients in app group listen to app ≥5 min. This 
will be a summary result based on the cohort of all app patients and not allow identification of individual patients.

 The protocol and consent forms are reviewed on annual basis through the Tufts IRB. Should the need for changes become necessary they will be handled through the Tufts’ IRB  after prior revi ew by [CONTACT_36164].  
 All study records, including assent forms will be kept in locked cabinets at the Tufts Dental School in a room that has limited access and remains locked at all times.

6.2.2  Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization  
Enrollment  
There is a single informed  consent form. Enrollment is defined as the randomization 
date and is recorded on the case report form .   
Baseline Assessments 
Once the patient is enrolled Demographics  and History  will be recorded on the Tufts 
University School of Dental Medicine Research Participant& Dental History form 
(Appendix). 
Assessments include:  
• Age 
• Gender  
• Race  
• Medical history  
• Medications  
 
Eligibility and withdrawal criteria  will be rechecked prior to randomization by [CONTACT_684373].  The participant will be asked to complete a NIDA Quick Screen . No identifiable 
information will be collected on the NIDA Quick Screen (only the subject ID 
number). The NIDA (National Institute on Drug Abuse) Quick Screen will be used to assess drug use (in cluding tobacco, alcohol and illegal substances) and nonmedical 
use of prescription drugs. The NIDA Quick Screen is a brief questionnaire that addresses overall substance use risk, with likely utility for use in a dental setting. This screening tool is intended to be used by [CONTACT_684374]. Its algorithm also identifies patients in need of counseling. The instrument is not used as legal- criminal screen. Furthermore, the NIDA is expected to 
be a routine tool for the history intake at the Craniofacial Pain Center as an important clinical tool in patient assessment.

on validated 0- 10 scales (0 -no pain/anxiety at all, 10-worst pain/anxiety possible). 
The research assistant will ask about their pain and anxiety using the same verbiage 
provided on the patient diary, and record their response. 
Randomization  
Randomization will be performed after  completion of screening and baseline to 
determine which tablet and thereby [CONTACT_684375].  
6.2.[ADDRESS_927211]’s regular scheduled providers, and are not part of the study team. The four tablets used in the study will be labeled A,B,C,D and will be preloaded with the app or white noise by [CONTACT_684376], LLC  in randomized sequence. The study 
personnel at TUSDM will not be aware which tablet presents test or control content. The opening screen and option screen of the white noise control app will use the same color scheme and lay -out as the one of the test Comfort Talk app to minimize the 
likelihood that personnel become aware of the patient’s group attribution. While there may still be a possibility of unblinding in the waiting room or procedure room should the patient ask the research assistant a direct question, strict blinding will be maintained for the analysis for the data. The statistical team of [CONTACT_684400] a nd 
[CONTACT_684401] will receive the encoded data entries and will not be informed about the content of the tablets until all analyses are completed. Since they also will not have direct contact [CONTACT_684377].  Patients randomized to the app will receive a download coupon for the app at the time of their visit for home use. Patients attributed to the control group will receive a coupon code after their return their post-visi t diary a week later. To enable this while 
maintaining blinding of study personnel, at the end of their visit, all patients will receive a sealed envelope exteriorly labeled with A,B,C,D according to their group attribution. The Hypnalgesics, LLC  will have  prefilled and sealed the envelopes 
according to group attribution either with a download coupon for patients receiving the test tablets, and a thank you note and information that they will receive their download code after they send in their questionnaire for control patients.   All patients sending back their diaries will receive the download coupon with their check. This will lead to some duplication for the test patients who already had received a download coupon at the time of their clinic visit but this will maintain blinding of study personnel. 
 
The study intervention does not carry risks such as drug trial would in that patient management would need be changed based on which group a patient had been 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 25 of 44 attributed to. Therefore circumstances which would require breaking the bind are not 
envisioned.  
 
6.2.4 Follow -up Visits  
None 
6.2.5 Completion/ Final Evaluation  
The outpatient visit at the time of enrollment is the  participant’s first and at the same 
time final visit with regard to the study.  
After obtaining the baseline data the research assistant will hand the participant a 
tablet containing, depending on the group attribution, either the app (App Group) or white noise (Control Group) and will be shown how to opera te the tablet.  
Participant will then return to the clinic waiting area with the tablet and wait for their regularly scheduled appointment. The patient will be at liberty to when and for how long to listen.   At the end of the waiting room period the parti cipant will be queried again for their 
levels of pain and anxiety.  
After the participant enters the treatment room, he or she will be able to continue to 
listen to the app or white noise on the tablet. The treating dental practitioner will not be made aware of the group attribution and conduct the treatment as usual. The research assistant will ask the participant every 10 min  (+/- 2 minutes) to indicate 
their pain and anxiety levels. The research assistant will note the duration of chair time, the amount of lidocaine given, if any or which other medications were given during the appointment, and whether the dental practitioner prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], prescription or non-prescription drugs at the end of the visit. This information will be obtained by [CONTACT_684378].  
Before leaving home, the participant will be asked to fill out a satisfaction survey based on a modified Press Ganey Template. The participant will then receive a diary card on which to note pain, average and maximal pain as well its location, use of non-prescription, prescription, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_162228], use of the app, and be provided pre-stamped envelopes. Patients will be asked to complete the diary daily before bedtime for 7 days. Patients in the experimental group will receive a coupon (coded by [CONTACT_19313]) for free download of the app at the end of their study visit.  
Once the diary is mailed back and received by [CONTACT_3476], the participant will be 
sent a check in the mail. Participants randomized to the control condition will also receive a coupon for the app upon returning the diary. 
 
Participants who discontinue the study intervention  early  do not require any specific 
evaluation or follow- up. Potential  reasons for early termination  may  be that patient’s 
dental treatment is cancelled by [CONTACT_684379]’t want 
to be bothered to provide more data. Since this study is on an intent- to-treat all study 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 26 of 44 data that are already collected will be maintained and the total patient enrollment 
numbers will form the denominator of analyses. 
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
The app is a non-Significant Risk Device (NSR). It does not perform diagnostic tasks or tie in with a device that requires FDA clearance (such as apps aiding in ECG interpretation or detection of skin malignancies). The NSR status was confirmed by [CONTACT_684380] 7/20/2017. 
7.[ADDRESS_927212] are as follows:  
The risks of participating in this study are not beyond the normal risks for the dental procedures in the TUSDM Craniofacial Pain Center which are considered standard of care.  
 Patients who are randomized to one of the control group and who are anxious ma y be 
disappointed for not getting the app while waiting.  There is the risk of loss of confidentiality to the subject by [CONTACT_4907].  This risk will be kept to a minimum by [CONTACT_684381] t he TUSDM IRB.  
 These risks are considered to be minimal and are addressed in the protocol and consent form.  Because any dental procedure with or without the app can cause increasing anxiety and pain, anxiety and pain will be monitored at frequent interval s with validated 0 -10 
verbal assessment scales during their clinic visit. The investigators at the Craniofacial Pain Center at TUSDM are furthermore experts in managing patient’s pain and distress and assure (as they do for all their patients) that they le ave with acceptable 
comfort levels. [CONTACT_684399] and Jackson are furthermore psychologically trained and will be able to recognize any unexpected AEs related to participating in the study.  
 When patients hear drill sounds or had prior traumatic experiences and the environment suddenly reminds them of those, they can vividly relieve the old trauma. This is very rare in a dental setting and can occur whether patients would listen to an app or not.  
7.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
 
Adverse events will be recorded in source documents and on case report forms. All 
adverse events and non-serious situations will be recorded, monitored, and reported to the IRB at time of continuing review or at the study’s termination if this occurs before the study’s next continuing review.  
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 27 of 44 To assess relationship of an event to study intervention, the following guidelines are 
used: 
1. Related (Possible, Probable, Definite) 
i. The event is known to occur with the study intervention. 
ii. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset. 
iii. The event abates when the intervention is discontinued. 
iv. The event reappears upon a re-challenge with the intervention. 
2. Not Related (Unlikely, Not Related)  
i. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event 
onset. 
ii. An alternate etiology has been established.  
 
7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding, symptom, or disease, temporally associated with a subject’s participation in the research.  
Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
 
An unanticipated problem is an incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 1) The nature, severity, or frequency is unexpected for the subject population or research activities as described in the current IRB approved protocol, supporting documents, and the ICF(s); 2) it is related or possibly related to participation in the research; 3) it suggests the research may place the subject or 
others at a greater risk of harm then was previously recognized.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADEs)  
Unanticipated adverse device effect means any serious adverse effe ct on health or 
safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 28 of 44  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is one that results in death, or is life -threatening, or results in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or results in a persistent or 
significant disability/incapacitation, or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or may jeopardize the  subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
 Adverse events will be recorded in source documents and on case report forms. All adverse events and non-serious situations will be recorded, monitored, and reported to the IRB at time of continuing review or at the study’s termination if this occurs before the study’s next continuing review.   Serious adverse events will be recorded in source documents and on case report forms. Serious Adverse Events that meet the criteria of an unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days following the Reportable New Information Policy. Serious Adverse Events not meeting the criteria for an unanticipated  problem will be reported to the IRB at time of continuing review or at 
the study’s termination if this occurs before the study’s next continuing review.  Unanticipated problems will be recorded in source documents and on case report forms. Unanticipated problems will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days after the PI/study team becomes aware of the problem. A Reportable New Information Form will be submitted to the IRB no later than 5 business days after the PI/study team becomes aware of the problem.  
 UADEs will be documented in source documents and on case report forms as to onset, severity, duration, management, outcome and relatedness to the test device. UADEs will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_927213]. 
 
7.5 Follow -up for Adverse Events 
AEs will be followed until resolved or considered stable through the psychologists of the Craniofacial treatment Center at Tufts (Drs. Kulich, the site PI, and [CONTACT_213554], the research assistant).   
7.6 Safety Monitoring  
A Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) and Independent Monitoring Committee 
protocol has been submitted to NCCIH on 06/01/[ADDRESS_927214] Withdrawal/Termination Criteria are  
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 29 of 44 − Subjects who do not comply with the study procedures, such as not 
returning diaries  
− Subjects who decide to stop participating in the study will be withdrawn from further data requests.     
 
The Site -Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_684346] -investigators will determine whether 
subjects (either withdrawn subjects or subjects completing the study) are in need of additional treatment and/or follow-up observation as a result of participation in this trial. Subjects and/or their insurance will be responsible for the cost of any standa rd 
of care follow -up visits or additional treatment that is not part of this study.  
 If a subject withdraws or is withdrawn, any data collected up to that point will still be used for the study which is on an Intent- to-Treat basis and therefore will includ e the 
withdrawn individuals in the denominator. However, no further data will be collected for that subject.  
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.[ADDRESS_927215] the hypothesis that 
listening to a Comfort Talk® app with calmative content reduces pain, anxiety, and post-procedural medication use. The study design is based on a 1:1 randomized attribution  of participants to an app or white noise as control condition. 
  The feasibility criteria are not hypothesis driven and are based on practical pass/fail criteria:  
     primary feasibility outcome parameter:  
• ability to obtain complete on -site data sets fro m at least 90% of patients 
enrolled  - with at least 40% from patients in the app group and at least 40% from patients in the control group) 
secondary feasibility outcome parameters:  
• ability to enroll 60 patients by [CONTACT_4475] 150 after initiation of recruitment in the 
clinic (=day 1)  
• obtaining 38 packages of filled out diary cards ( at least [ADDRESS_927216] 16 from patients in the control group). 
• 90% of patients in app group listen to app ≥5 min  
 
Since a significant redu ction in anxiety in the waiting room is the main ingredient that 
underlies all other hypothesized effects for Phase II outcomes, even in the face of proven technical feasibility of trial execution , it was chosen as the overall primary 
objective for Phase I I. 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 30 of 44  
Statistical hypotheses for Phase II are:  
Providing participants a calmative Comfort Talk® app at the time of their dental 
outpatient visit   
- reduces anxiety in the dental waiting room (primary hypothesis) 
- reduces pain in the dental waiting room - reduces anxiety during dental treatment  
- reduces  pain during dental treatment - improves patient satisfaction with the dental visit - reduces  anxiety in the week after treatment  
- reduces  pain in the week after treatment  
- reduces need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_684347]/dentist supervision will carry over into recovery and thus reduce need for addictive drugs (see also 2.2). 
 
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization 
The goal is to enroll 72 patients in a randomized design with 36 patients utilizing the app and 36 patients not utilizing the app. Those randomized to utilizing the app (app group) will receive a tablet with the app, those randomized to not utilizing the app (control group) will receive a tablet with white noise.   
Based on prior trial experience, it is likely that 90% of patients on site will provide 
onsite data sets (primary objective). In two prior trials, in which 241 and 201 patients, 
respectively, were followed through their invasive medical procedures, all enrolled patients (100%) provided these data (1,3). In a breast-biopsy trial, 4 of 240 (1.6%) withdrew by [CONTACT_684382] (2). In these past trials patients received more personal 
attention through live delivery of the content that is now offered in an app, and thus willingness to remain in the study may not be as high in the current trial but still should exceed 90%  for feasibility . To arrive at a reasonable sample size to satisfy this 
requiremen t, but also obtain a sense of validity of the primary hypothesis for Phase II 
and obtain estimates of data distribution, which will be critical for sample size and analysis planning Phase II, we conducted following sample size calculations.  
Assuming an average anxiety rating of 4 at the end of the waiting room time without prior guidance in relaxation or app (see Fig 3., time 0), the expectation of improved subsequent outcomes with a 35% reduction in anxiety to 2.6 based on Schupp et al (33 vs 53 on STAI - ( 1) and a standard deviation of 2, [ADDRESS_927217] with a power of 0.80 and an alpha of 0.05.  
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 31 of 44 This degree of reduction in anxiety is clinically significant based on prior work in a 
clinical trial that demonstrated that a 35% difference in anxiety at the onset of an invasive medical procedure is associated with significan t differences in the 
subsequent experience of pain and anxiety during the procedure, need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_684331], and the overall length of the procedure. These factors directly affect procedure safety and throughput (e.g. economical efficienc y). 
Using this number of 66 patients as guide to determine a target study size for assessment of the feasibility parameters an enrollment of 72 patient s seemed 
compatible with an early drop-out of 6 patients resulting in a n expected  91.7% onsite 
data return rate . This will also support the expectation of receiving 38 packages of 
filled out diary cards (53%), a secondary objective. In a prior breast biopsy trial, in which patients collected for 5 days 4 daily salivary cortisol samples , filled out more 
extensive diary cards, and sent all back to the lab, 36% complied ( 45). Considering 
the higher burden of also getting 4 daily salivary samples and 4 daily entries as compared to one da ily entry on cards at bed -time a 53% return rate  for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_684348].   
This sample size of 72 participants may also give an estimate in as far results 
previously achieved with live delivery of Comfort Talk® may be transferable to assumptions for app delivered Comfort Talk® content. 
 
The following sample size estimate supports the evaluation of post-procedure pain and is based on a prior breast biopsy trial (19) during which we collected postoperative pain measures. In that study, postoperative pain ratings in the live Comfort Talk gro up were less than those of the control group (1.6 vs 3.5) with a 
standard deviation of 2.0. Assuming a similar reduction in pain from 3.5 to 1.6 on day 1 (similar effect size in a study by [CONTACT_684383]) (43) and a standard deviation of 2.0, [ADDRESS_927218]. Jackson/research assist ant will consent the patients, hand the patient the tablet 
based on the randomization scheme (which will be provided by [CONTACT_6283]. Finkelman and Roomian), obtain baseline data, query and record trial data but will not analyze  data. 
There is a possibility that he may become unblinded, however he will not share his observations with the analyzing team. 
Protocol Template, Version 1.[ADDRESS_927219] any patient interactions and thus also will also not be privy to any accidental unblinding of tablet content during the dental treatment.  
9.3  Definition of Populations  
The study is based on ITT (Intent to treat) .  
9.4 Interim Analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_684349].  
This study may be terminated for the following reasons:  
 Discovery of unforeseen risk that could jeopardize the dental/physical we ll-
being of subjects. 
 Enrollment or recall rates that are not likely to produce sufficient data for 
evaluation of safety and efficacy  
 Non-compliance with the clinical investigational plan, the Investigator  
 Agreement, applicable FDA regulations or conditions of approval imposed by 
[CONTACT_3488]  
 Any new information becomes available during the trial that necessitates 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356] 
 Withdrawal of IRB approval  
Findings that might trigger a safety review are the number of SAEs overall, the 
number of occ urrences of a particular type of SAE, severe AEs/reactions, or increased 
frequency of events. Such findings are presented to the Independent Monitoring Committee (IMC)  statistician to review the events by [CONTACT_684384]. The statistician reports his findings to 
a closed session of the IMC  or to the Safety Officer and/or NCCIH . The findings are 
used to determine what steps will be taken.  
9.5 Outcomes  
The outcomes are based on patient’s repor ted measures of anxiety, pain, satisfaction 
rating on a Likert scale, and medication use and objective numbers with regard to the feasibility measures. These data are clear numerical values and not subject to interpretation/adjudication with regard to their reported value .  
There will be no loss of follow-up for data for the primary outcome parameter since all patients who are on site are the denominator and any missing data would be reflected in the percentage of complete on -site data sets.   
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 33 of 44  
For management of any subsequent missing intermittent data the method will use all 
data available data that are available within the intent -to-treat overall approach .  
We will be using all available data and calculate the percent missing data for each 
treatment group. The degree of missingness will inform  accept/reject  feasibility  
which is defined as complete on -site data sets from at least 90% of patients enrolled 
with at least 40% from patients in the app group and at least 40% from patients in the control group) and 38 packages of filled out diary cards 52% with at least 16 (22%) from patients in the app group and at least 16 from patients in the control group (22%)  
9.5.1 Primary Outcome   
• percentage of complete on-site data sets  
 
9.5.[ADDRESS_927220] to Phase I of the trial feasibility parameters will be  
• number of enrolled patients by [CONTACT_4475] 150 after initiation of recruitment in the 
clinic (=day 1)  
• number of returned packages of filled out diary cards.  
• percentage of patients in app group listen to app ≥[ADDRESS_927221] to Phase I  
• anxiety on a validated 0 -10 scale in the dental waiting room 
• pain on a validated 0-10 scale in the dental waiting room 
• anxiety q10 min (+/ - 2 mins) on during dental treatment 
• pain q10 min (+/ - 2 mins) during dental treatment 
• anxiety, average, and maximal anxiety for 7 days  after treatment  
• pain, average and maximal pain  for 7 days after treatment  
• use of prescription and nonprescription drugs for 7 days  after treatment  
• patient satisfaction  
•  
Pain and anxiety  will be measured on 0- 10 verbal self -reporting scales (0=no 
pain/anxiety at all, and 10=worst pain possible). The pain scale is recommended 
standard in the NIH Toolbox ( 62). For the 0- 10 anxiety scale we previously 
demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity ( 63).  
 
Anxiety and pain measures will obtained using these scales by [CONTACT_684385] “How is your Comfort Level on a scale with 0-no anxiety at all, and [ADDRESS_927222] anxiety possible and 0=no pain at all and 10=worst pain pos sible”:  
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 34 of 44 • At the beginning of the waiting room time after consent  
• At the end of the waiting room time  
• After the patient enters the dental treatment room and sits down = time 0 
of chair time  
• Every 10 minutes (+/ - 2 minutes) thereafter while on the chair  
• When  leaving the dental treatment room  
Once returned home the patients are asked to use the same scales to write down on daily diary cards for 7 days before bedtime as follows: 
PLEASE INDICATE YOUR COMFORT LEVELS WITH A NUMBER BETWEEN [ADDRESS_927223] to pain (0=no pain at all and 10=worst pain possible) 
• Right now:  
• On the average today:  
• At its maximum today:  
With regard to anxiety (0=no anxiety at all and 10=worst anxiety possible) 
• Right now:  
• On the average today:  
• At its maximum today:  
Patient S atisfaction will be assessed using a modified Press Ganey Outpatient Survey 
template (64) adjusted to dental care and supplemented with a question regarding 
helpfulness of the app on the same 5-point scale as the remainder of the survey. The Press Ganey instrument has been found to possess suitable psychometric properties for outpatient medica l practice survey ( 65). 
 
9.6 Data Analyses  
All outcome parameters for assessment of study feasibility are pass/fail criteria not 
requiring further analyse s beyond calculations of sums and percentages. 
 
To commit to a detailed analyses in Phase II, this can only be done with the proviso that the approach may change based on the data distribution, central measures and variation, and particularly time course, the determination of which is a goal of this Phase I trial.  
 
For comparison of change in anxiety and pain from start to end of the waiting room 
time we propose t-test if normally distributed or the Mann- Whitney U test in the case 
of non-normal data.   
 
For the time course assessment of pain and anxiety during the procedure there are 
options depending on whether the data meet the assumptions required for time course analysis.   
 Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations as well as counts and percentages) will be calculated for each outcome stratified by [CONTACT_684386], Version 1.0 35 of 44 treatment group.  Pain and anxiety trends over time will be assessed graphically for 
each patient s tratified by [CONTACT_1570].  
 With the provision that the analysis plan will be adapted based on the metrics found in Phase I, the plan is to follow a previously described path ( 24):  
 
If the relationship between pain/anxiety is linear over time, and if needed, normality and homoscedasticity of residuals can be achieved by  [CONTACT_26500]-transformation, a repeated -
measures analysis to compare the effect of treatment, time, and treatment by [CONTACT_684387] ( 66, 67).The analysis 
will use the reports from the successi ve 10 min (+/ - 2 mins) intervals queries obtained 
from all patients.   It may be that residuals are neither normally distributed nor possible to obtain a normal distribution by [CONTACT_684388]. This happened in prior large scale trial with procedural pain procedural were 47% of pain responses were zero ( 45). To 
accommodate such a strong skew in reported pain, we would change our statistical approach to ordinal regression ( 68).  If the proportional odds assumption is met, 
ordinal regression accounting for repeated measures will be performed to compare the effect of treatment, time, and interaction of treatment by [CONTACT_684389]. The results will be presented in terms of the slopes of the time course of pain and anxiety on the logit scale.   If the data does not meet the assumptions required for the time- series analysis 
methods listed above, the time- series data from each patient will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_684390].  Normality will be assessed graphically using histograms and q-q plots.  Area under the curve will be compared between the two treatment groups using t- test if normally distributed or if normality 
can be achieved by [CONTACT_26500] -transformation.  Mann- Whitney U test will be used if data is 
non-normal.   
 
Pain and anxiety for the week after the post procedure will be assessed for linearity 
graphically. Individual patient pain and anxiety slopes will be compared using t- test 
or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate, to determine if the rate of change of pain and anxiety is different between treatment and control groups.  In addition, the overall mean pain and mean anxiety for each patient will be calculated and compared between treatment and control groups using t- test or Mann -Whitney U test as 
appropriate.   
 Drug usage, converted in equivalence drug score, and satisfaction scores will be 
assessed by t -test if normally distributed or Mann-Whitney- U test if non -normal.  
 All tests will be two -sided at a significance level of <0.05. Sample size will be based 
on results of Phase I assuming a power of 80%. SAS version 9.4 will be used for analysis.  
 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0 36 of 44 Patients’ age, gender, procedure type, and NIDA Quick score  will be assessed for 
their p otential as confounding factors. This will support guidance for trial design in 
Phase II.

Statistical Considerations 
1. An initial target of up to 500 subjects will be enrolled in the VICTAS Study. Subjects 
will be randomized to study invention or control in 1:1 fashion. A priori stoppage rules will determine final number of subjects  (up to 2000)  enrolled based on adaptive 
design. 
2. All randomized subjects will be included in the ITT analysis set. The ITT popul ation will be 
used for all primary, secondary, and other efficacy analyses. In these analyses, subjects will be classified according to the treatment randomized (not actual treatment received).

[LOCATION_002], the incidence is increasing and currently there are more 1,750,000 cases each year , with 
more than half requiring intensive care unit (ICU)  admission .3-5 Further, sepsis cases account for 30% -
50% of all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241900] , making it the 3rd leading cause of death in the [LOCATION_002] , and is the most

20 – 30%.5,[ADDRESS_386604] demonstrated reproducible benefits.18,19 
 
3.3. Overview of Combination Therapy 
 In June of 2017, Marik  et al. published the outcomes of 47 patients admitted to the ICU of an academic 
medical center with severe sepsis or septic shock and a procalcitonin (PCT) level of > 2 ng/mL.
20  All 
patients were treated  with a combination of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 hours), vitamin C 
(1.5 g every 6 hours), and thiamine (200 mg every 12 hours) . The outcomes of the patients were compared 
to 47 historic controls from their center, 60% of whom received hydrocortisone per the guidelines of the American College of Critical Care Medicine.
21,22 Mortality in the treated group was significantly lower 
than in the historical control group (8.5% v. 40.4%; p < 0.001).  In a propensity adjusted analysis, the odds of death in the treated group was 0.13 (95% CI, 0.04 – 0.48; p = 0.002). Additional findings included a 
shorter duration of vasopressor support (18.3h v. 55h; p < 0.001) , a lower requirement for renal 
replacement therapy ( RRT, p = 0.02) and a greater improvement in SOFA score at 72 hours (p = 0.001)  
for the treatment group.  Although these results are promising, they require further study and confirmation 
in a rigorous randomized contr ol trial before such treatment can be advocated broadly. The components 
of the treatment and the rationale for their inclusion are detailed below: 
  Vitamin C  – Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient not synthesized by [CONTACT_1978].
[ADDRESS_386605], which in turn facilitates absorption.  Importantly, vi tamin C is a well-known 
antioxidant, which reduces oxidative damage of DNA, protein, and low -density lipoprotein.  Further, it 
decreases lipid peroxidation, extracellular oxidants from neutrophils, and endothelium -dependent 
vasodilatation.23,24  
  
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, 2019 
    
 
  Page 10 of 64 Oxidative stress is a well -described phenomenon in sepsis and is characterized by [CONTACT_314092], including nitric oxide (•NO), superoxide (O), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 
peroxynitrite (ONOO-), hypochlorous acid (HOCl), and hydroxyl free radicals (•OH).26,[ADDRESS_386606] rated to 
improve epi[INVESTIGATOR_314040], as well as attenuate microvascular coagulation abnormalities and thrombosis in the lung.
34,35  Lastly, it has been shown that mice with 
adequate or repleted vitamin C levels are less likely to experience organ dysfunction in the setting of 
sepsis.36 
  
High dose intravenous vitamin C has been used in a variety of inflammatory conditions.  In an unblinded study, patients with > 30% total body surface area burns were randomized into vitamin C (66 mg/kg/hr) 
and control groups.[ADDRESS_386607] 
24 and 48 hours, exhibited better PaO 2/FiO2 ratios, and required significantly fewer days on mechanical 
ventilation.  In another study, 595 critically ill surgical patients were randomized to either enteric a lpha-
tocopherol (1000 IU  every 8 hours) and intravenous vitamin C (1g every 8 hours) or standard care.38   
Although there was no difference in progression to pneumonia or acute lung injury (the combined primary 
outcome), the development of organ failure was significantly lower and ICU length of stay was shorter in 
patients that received alpha-tocopherol and vitamin C. 
  More recently, Fowler et al.  completed a phase I safety trial of intravenous vitamin C on patients with 
severe sepsis or septic shock.
39 In this study, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to low dose intravenous 
vitamin C (50 mg/kg/24 h), high dose intravenous vitamin C (200 mg/kg/24h), or placebo.  Importantly, no adverse events due to vitamin C at either dose were observed.  The pro- inflammatory markers C -
reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were significantly reduced in patients randomized to 
receive vitamin C, as was thrombomodulin, a measure of vascular endothelial injury.
 
   Hydrocortisone  – The 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recommend the use of moderate dose 
corticosteroids for patients with septic shock who remain hemodynamically unstable after fluid resuscitation and vasopressor initiation.
12 In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_314041]., moderate dose corticosteroids 
were added to vitamin C and thiamine to capi[INVESTIGATOR_135814] “the multiple and overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_314042]  a single molecule or pathway”.[ADDRESS_386608] of vitamin C restores these binding sites to their normal conformation.45 
Glucocorticoids in turn enhance the transport of vitamin C into cells, thereby [CONTACT_314093].
46 Lastly, the integrity of vascular endothelial cells exposed to endotoxin is greater when 
bathed in a combination of vitamin C and glucocorticoid, than with placebo or either agent by [CONTACT_5071].47

those in the Krebs Cycle and pentose phosphate pathway.[ADDRESS_386609] significantly lower levels of serum lactate at 24 hours.  Further, there was a reduction in mortality among this group compared to thiamine deficient patients who were randomized to receive placebo.   In addition to the putative benefits of thiamine repletion in septic patients, thiamine is a cofactor for the enzyme glyoxylate am inotransferase, which converts glyoxylate to carbon dioxide.  Without this enzyme, 
glyoxylate would be converted to oxalate, which can deposit in the kidneys and cause oxalate nephropathy (see risks/benefits section below).
51,52 
 
3.4. Rationale for the Study 
 
Though the reduction in mortality from 40.4% to 8.5% observed in the Marik study is notable, and has generated significant excitement in the lay press, to date there are no examples of therapeutics that improve survival as a result of modifying the inflammatory cascade of sepsis.
[ADDRESS_386610] 
assessment of the value of this therapeutic regimen  prior to adoption. 
  The purpose of the current study is therefore to determine (or confirm) the efficacy of the combination 
therapy described in the Marik publication in the management of patients with circulatory and/or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_314043].  This subset of sepsis patients has been chosen because they 
are easily identified, have a high mortality, and consume significant critical care resources.  As such, any improvements in outcomes attributed to effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_314044] g reat value to patients, as well as 
their care providers and healthcare systems. Further, because the promulgated therapi[INVESTIGATOR_314045], its efficacy would have important implications the 
management of sepsi s in both well and poorly resourced settings worldwide.  
 
3.5. Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
Vitamin C  
High dose intravenous vitamin C has been in clinical use for more than half a century ,
59,[ADDRESS_386611] been reported are also rare, and are mild with two exceptions: oxalate 
nephropathy and hemolysis.  Oxalate is a metabolite of vitamin C.  At high concentrations, it can deposit in the kidneys leading to oxalate nephropathy.  This has been reported among individuals who either (1) 
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5

  Page 12 of 64 received grams pe r hour of intravenous vitamin C ,63-66 or (2) received moderate to high doses of ora l 
vitamin C for weeks to months.67-[ADDRESS_386612] been obs erved when measurements are 
made using point of care glucometers during the administration of very high dose intravenous vitamin C 
to burn patients (66 mg/kg/hour).
75,76 Treatment of falsely elevated glucose could result in potentially 
harmful hypoglycemic events.  Two studies comparing glucose levels measured by [CONTACT_314094] (Accu Chek by [CONTACT_253165], 
Indianapolis, IN, [LOCATION_003]) overestimate actual  glucose levels as serum vitamin C concentration  increased up 
to or above 851 µM.77,78   In the phase I study by [CONTACT_314095], patients received 50 mg/kg/day in 4 divided 
doses.39  For a 70 kg man, this is equivalent to 3.5 g/day intravenous vitamin C. In that study, the average 
day 4 vitamin C trough level was 331 µM ( range: 101 - 806).  H ypoglycemic events were not reported , 
but glucose was measured in a central lab oratory.  In the Marik study, 6 g/day of intravenous vitamin C 
was administered in 4 divided doses (as  is planned for this study), and no epi[INVESTIGATOR_314046].20  Further, Marik et al, measured glucose levels using the Accu -Chek Inform  
glucometer  ([COMPANY_002] Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, [LOCATION_003]) at the end of vitamin C infusion, and found 
similar glucose values as those measured in the central lab oratory.79  They conclude d the fictitious 
hyperglycemia was  not a clinically significant problem at the doses of vitamin C used in their study (and 
those that will be used in VICTAS) .75  However, the Marik protocol also refers to a strategy of “permissive 
hyperglycemia” in which insulin wa s not given unless glucose exceeded  220 mg/dl.80  
 Given the serum vitamin C concentrations  observed in the study by [CONTACT_314095], i t is reasonable to 
consider that some patients in the current study may develop vitamin C concentrations that could interfere 
with some point of care glucometers.  Only one point of care glucometer has been approved by [CONTACT_314096].
81 The accuracy of this device has been validated to vitamin C 
concentrations we will not approach, as well as many other interfering substances encountered in the critical care setting.  As a safety measure, we will require that participating centers only use  this point of 
care glucometer, or  validated central  or critical care laboratory devices  to measure glucose in study 
participants.   
 
 
 Thiamine  
Thiamine rarely causes any side effects  when given orally or intravenously (as planned in this study).
82  
However, rarely reported side effects are injection site reactions (such as irritation or redness) and hypersensitivity reactions (the only contraindication to thiamine use). In a study of 989 consecutive

  Page 13 of 64 patients who received 100 mg intravenous boluses of thiamine (1070 doses), a total of 12 adverse 
reactions were reported (1.1%).[ADDRESS_386613] been reported include difficulties with wound healing.  Rare, but serious side effects of steroid s include fluid retention, thinning of the skin, muscle weakness, and acute mental status 
changes.  Though these potential adverse effects are recognized, they are rare and relate to chronic steroid use at higher doses. They are not anticipated when steroids are given in the setting of sepsis, where the dose is relatively low, and the duration short (as is planned in the current study).

Primary outcome 
 
The primary outcome for this trial is the number of consecutive days free of vasopressors and 
mechanical ventilation (VVFD) in the first [ADDRESS_386614] date the 
patient was free of both ventilator and vasopressor support. Patients who die are scored zero 
VVFD, and patients who return to ventilator support or vasopressor support (as defined in the inclusion criteria) will have the VVFD count reset to zero days. 
 
Secondary Outcomes  
 
Secondary outcomes will be mortality at 30 days , ICU mortality, mortality at 180 days, length of 
ICU stay, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and long- term emotional and cognitive outcomes at 180 days.

  Page 16 of 64 6. Study Design  
 
6.1. Design Overview  
 
The VItamin C, Thiamine And Steroids in Sepsis (VICTAS) Study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
adaptive randomized clinical trial designed to investigate the efficacy of the combined use of vitamin C, 
thiamine and corticosteroids (hereafter "Treatment Protocol" or “TP”) versus indistinguishable placebos (hereafter "Control Protocol" or “CP”) for patients with sepsis.  The trial employs a novel endpoint that approximates a patient's risk of death based on the time spent on vasopressors or receiving respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]. Time spent on vasopressors or receiving respi[INVESTIGATOR_314048] a patient's speed of recovery. Mortality rate is a key secondary endpoint for the trial. 
 The trial has a flexible sample size that will be determined adaptively. The trial will have an initial 
enrollment target of  up to [ADDRESS_386615] a potential mortality difference of 20% , a conservative 
estimate based on the 32% benefit observed in the study by [CONTACT_314097], et al. However, if the data are 
indeterminate on mortality  at N=200, 300, or 400 subjects, the trial may continue to a larger sample size  
(up to 2000) using an adaptive “Gol dilocks” strategy  based on the primary en dpoint of VVFD with 
assessments at 500, 1000, 1500, or 2000 subjects randomized to either the  TP or CP . The overall type I 
error rate for the trial is controlled at 2.5%. The early interim analyses have conservative rules for spending 
alpha so that 0.1% will be used up to N=400 and the remaining 2.4% is reserved for N=500 (or beyond). For more detail, please see section on Statistical Considerations below (Section 11).  
  
6.2. Interim Analyses and Criteria for Study Termination 
 
Early interim analyses  focused on detection of a large mortality effect  will be conducted as soon as 
possible following the enrollment of subject numbers 200, 300, and 400. At each of these points, predictive 
probability of meeting significance on the endpoint of mortality once all currently enrolled subjects have been followed to their final outcome will be calculated. If predictive probability of achieving statistical significance (with one-sided alpha set at 0.001) exceeds 90%, study accrual will  be stopped. All currently 
enrolled subjects will continue and the final analysis will be conducted after all currently enrolled subjects have been followed to their final outcome.  If these conditions are not met, the trial will continue under an adaptive  “Goldilocks” strategy with a 
primary endpoint of VVFD. Interim analyses under this design will be performed as soon as possible following the enrollment of subject numbers 500, 1000 and 1500. Following each of these interim 
analyses, any one of the following actions may result:  
 
a. Stoppage of the trial for futility  on VVFD (6.2.a) 
b. Stoppage of accrual for expected success on VVFD and mortality  (6.2.b) 
c. Stoppage of accrual for expected success on VVFD alone (6.2c) 
d. Continuation to the next analysis (6.2.d) 
 
The decision criteria are based on predictive probabilities of meeting statistical significance on VVFD or 
mortality. Thus, we compute the predictive probability that  VVFD (and mortality) will meet statistical 
significance once all currently enrolled subjects have been followed to their final outcome  (30 days after 
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, 2019 
    
 
  Page 17 of 64 enrollment) . We also compute the predictive probability that VVFD (and mortality) will be significant if 
the trial continues to its maximum sample size of N=2000. Each of the possible interim actions is described 
in greater detail below.  
  
a.) Stoppage of the trial for futility 
  
Stoppage of the trial for futility will occur if  there is less than 10% predictive probabil ity of ever detecting 
a statistically significant (alpha = 0.022)  beneficial effect on VVFD, even if enrollment continues to 2000 
subjects.  
  
b.) Stoppage of accrual for expected success on both VVFD and mortality.  
  
Accrual to the trial may stop for expected success on both the primary endpoint  of VVFD and mortality . 
This requires that predictive probability be greater than 95% for detection of a statistically significant beneficial effect on both VVFD (alpha = 0.022) and mortality (alpha = 0.024) at the current sample size. 
In order to meet this threshold, the data must already be strongly positive, and furthermore, there must be little risk that the subjects with outstanding data might reverse the success once all data becomes available. If this threshold is reached, then no additional subjects will be enrolled. Fol low-up of currently enrolled 
subjects will continue and the final analysis will be conducted after all currently enrolled subjects have been followed to their final outcome. 
 
c.) Stoppage of accrual for expected success on VVFD alone  
Accrual to the trial may also stop for expected success on the primary endpoint of VVFD alone. This 
requires that predictive probability for detecting a statistically significant beneficial effect (at the current sample size) on VVFD exceeds 95% and predictive probability for detection of such an effect on mortality  
(at the maximal sample size)  is less than 10%. Thus, the data must already be strongly positive for VVFD 
and indicate a low probability that significance can be achieved on mortality, even with additional sample size. If this early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_43701], then no additional subjects will be enrolled. Follow-up of 
currently enrolled subjects will continue and the final analysis will be conducted after all currently enrolled subjects have been followed to their final outcome. 
 d.) Continue to the next analysis   
If no condition for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_314049], then the trial will continue accrual to the next analysis time (either the next scheduled interim, or to full enrollment and final analysis). For more detail, 
please see section on Statistical Considerations below (Section 11). 
 
6.3. Number of Subjects 
 There is an initial enrollment target of 500 subjects, with a maximum of 2000 subjects to be 
enrolled in the VICTAS Trial. Subjects will be randomized to study invention or control in 1:1 
fashion. A priori stoppage rules will determine final number of subjects enrolled based on the 
adaptive study design.

q) Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal surrogate/representative to give written informed consent 
*Note: Co-enrollment in other interventional research studies requires written permission from the VICTAS Executive Committee in advance of subject identification.   
 
7.3. Screen Failures  
 All patients with suspected infection and sepsis should be screened after presenting to a study site hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (please see section 9.2: Screening and Informed Consent). Sites will maintain an electronic screen failure log that includes all patients with a diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock who are not randomized into VICTAS. Sites will document the primary reason for exclusion or failed enrollment.    Subjects who have been consented and subsequently determined to violate eligibility criteria, due to newly available data prior to randomization, will be excluded and documented as screen failures. Such events are expected to be rare, but may occur when study team becomes newly aware of historical data, such as chronic dependence on supplemental oxygen.
 
 
7.4. Study Completion and Discontinuations 
 
Study procedures should not delay clinical care. All randomized subjects will be included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.  Randomized subjects are expected to complete the trial.   
  Subjects have the right to withdraw from the trial for any reason at any time.  If the subject (or the patient’s legally authorized representative)  withdraws consent, for any reason, such an act prematurely stops the 
subject’s participation in the trial, and all scheduled trial- related interventions, assessments and laboratory 
testing will be stopped. All data collected prior to withdrawal will remain in the database but data obtained after the patient has withdrawn his/her consent will not be entered into the database. However, results from assessments and blood samples collected prior to the withdrawal of the consent but not analyzed at the time of the withdrawal will be entered into the database, unless the patient requests that these be removed.   
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, 2019 
    
 
  Page 20 of 64 Subjects or their legally authorized representatives may opt to discontinue the study intervention without 
full withdrawal of participation in research. Additionally, the site investigator, Co -PIs (Sevransky, 
Rothman and Wright) and/or DSMB may determine to prematurely discontinue the study intervention for safety or potential contraindications to study intervention. Subjects whose study intervention is te rminated 
prematurely, but who have not withdrawn from the study  will continue with all planned follow -up and 
study related assessments. 
 
  Subjects will only receive study drug while admitted to the ICU or in the ED while awaiting transfer to the ICU. If a subject’s level of care changes prior to final dose of study drug, study intervention will be discontinued upon physical transfer from the  ICU to another level of care (i.e., transferred to step -down 
or intermediate care, telemetry, med -surg, outside facility, home, etc.). Patients who have been  
downgraded, but physically remain in the ICU, will continue to receive study drug for 4 days or a s long 
as they are physically in the ICU  (whichever comes first).  
 
7.5. Inclusion of Minorities, Women and Children 
 Subjects will not be excluded based upon race, ethnicity or gender. Pregnant patients will be excluded. Pediatric patients (<18 years of age) will be excluded due to differing diagnostic criteria, care pathways, and protocols in sepsis.

  Protocol version date:  April 22, 2019 
    
 
  Page 21 of 64 8. Pharmacologic Intervention  
 
8.1. Agents 
 
The three agents being studied include: 
 
● Agent 1:  Vitamin C  
○ Route:  Intravenous infusion over 30 minutes 
○ Dose:  1.5 grams 
○ Frequency:  every 6 hours 
○ Duration:  96 hours 
 ● Agent 2:  Thiamine 
○ Route:  Slow intravenous push over 2 – 3 minutes 
○ Dose:  100 mg 
○ Frequency:  every 6 hours 
○ Duration:  96 hours 
 ● Agent 3:  Hydrocortisone 
○ Route:  Slow intravenous push over 2 – 3 minutes 
○ Dose:  50 mg  
○ Frequency:  every 6 hours 
○ Duration:  96 hours 
 
8.2. Rationale  
 
Daily recommended dietary allowances for vitamin C are in the range of 75 to 110mg/daily .
86,87   This is 
meant to exceed a mean dietary intake of 46  mg daily needed to prevent scurvy.  Normal serum levels of 
ascorbic acid are variable, but in the range of 50-70 μM in healthy, fasting adults .88  Levels of 
approximately 60 – 90 μM are achieved following maximal replet ion by [CONTACT_92913] C intake .89,90  Data 
in septic and critically ill cohorts demonstrate that serum levels are commonly < 20 μM (5) . Oral delivery 
of vitamin C is commonly used to restore serum levels to normal in deficient patients, however, high dose 
oral delivery of vitamin C does not increase serum vitamin C to therapeu tic levels needed for sepsis .23,89,90  
Rather, they generally plateau at < 100 μM even in studies using very high dose oral regimens. 
The use of intravenous vitamin C allows for rapid increases in serum levels many fold higher than oral 
dosing allows. At intravenous doses of ~2g daily in critically ill patients, mean serum levels of 
approximately [ADDRESS_386620] varied substantially.  In sepsis, simply repleting vitamin C to normal serum levels may  confer some benefit; however, the pluri -
potent therapeutic effects may require levels 3 -4 times normal.  Rapid repletion of vitamin C levels is only 
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, [ADDRESS_386621] chosen 1.5g every  six hours based on 
preliminary data suggesting efficacy at this dose or similar dosing regimens .20,39  Of note, dosing regimens 
that raise serum vitamin C levels to 10 -15 times normal (1 -5mM) are believed to trigger cytotoxic effects 
on malignant cells.[ADDRESS_386622] been associated with harmful side  effects (e.g. renal 
failure, hemolytic anemia, disruption of accurate glucose measurements) and are not thought to be of value in the treatment of sepsis.  We aimed for a dose that achieves serum level adequate to confer benefits by [CONTACT_28423][INVESTIGATOR_314052] C deficiency in patients.  
The rationale for thiamine supplementation in critical care and sepsis is detailed in the Background.  At a 
dose of 200mg twice daily, septic patients with a concurrent thiamine deficiency were demonstrated to have improved cl earance of lactate and decreased mortality .
[ADDRESS_386623] ete thiamine levels quickly .
93  Thiamine is poorly 
absorbed after oral ingestion, with a maximal GI absorption from single oral dosing of approximately 4-
5mg in healthy volunteers .93  Absorption is likely lower in alcoholics or the critically ill, further 
necessitating intravenous administration.  Some professional societies recommend doses as high as a total of 1500mg daily for patients with suspected Wernicke’s encephalopathy - a disease that results directly 
from thiamine depletion.  The optimal dose for suspected thiamine deficiency is not known.  Dose 
recommendations range from 200mg daily to 1500mg daily for patients w ith suspected deficiency .
94,[ADDRESS_386624] by 
[CONTACT_314099] a total dose of 400mg daily,50 and the short half -life of serum thiamine 
supported the 100mg q6h hour dosing strategy outlined above.   
The rationale for the use of hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock is detailed in the Background.  
The dosing strategy for hydrocortisone in the VICTAS trial is based on current guidelines for the treatment of patients with septic shock.  Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines rec ommend:  
 
“We suggest against using IV hydrocortisone to treat septic shock patients if adequate fluid 
resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability. If this is not achievable, we suggest IV hydrocortisone at a dose of 200  mg per day (weak 
recommendation, low quality of evidence).”  
8.3. Treatment and Study Drug Administration  
 
Randomized subjects will receive either active agents or placebos, labeled as VICTAS Study Drug 1, VICTAS Study Drug 2, and VICTAS Study Drug 3. The tabl e below details these three active agents or 
matching placebos.  
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, 2019 
    
 
  Page 23 of 64  
Administration  – Randomized subjects will receive VICTAS Study Drugs 1, 2, and 3, via intravenous 
administration every [ADDRESS_386625] dose should be administered as soon as possible but 
no longer than 4 hours from randomization. All subsequent doses should default to the local institution every 6 hour routine dosing schedule. All three study drugs should be administered within +/ - 2 hours of 
their scheduled time.  Missed doses should be treated via the “Treatment Compliance and Discontinuation” 
section of this protocol (page 27). All three study drugs should be administered separately and should not 
be infused or administered with any other medications or study drugs.  We recommend that study drugs [ADDRESS_386626] since they are IV push and study drug 1 is administered over 30 mins.  For 
subjects already prescribed open- label corticosteroids at the time of randomization, or for patients 
prescribed corticosteroids after randomization, see section below on steroid management.  VICTAS Study Drug 1  VICTAS Study Drug 2  VICTAS Study Drug 3

The total numbe r of individual study drug administrations is 48 (3 study drugs  per administration  x 4 
administrations per day x 4 days). The total number of study drug administration time points  per day is 4 
(3 study drugs per adm inistration) . 
Steroid Management  – See table below. For patients without clinically prescribed corticosteroids, 
VICTAS Study Drug 3 will always be administered. If treating physicians believe there is an indication 
for steroids, (i.e., continued shock after adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopr essor therapy, etc.),  they 
are permitted to initiate open -label corticosteroid therapy based on local practice and international 
guidelines.  If treating physicians place an active order prescribing at least 200 mg or greater of daily 
hydrocortisone, or equivalent (see APPENDIX A), then VICTAS Study Drug 3 (hydrocortisone  or 
placebo) will NOT be administered  (see table below) . The research team, investigational pharmacy, and 
clinical teams should monitor at least daily for new , or discontinued, corticosteroid orders for randomized 
patients. When new corticosteroid orders are discovered, the study team and pharmacy will discontinue  
VICTAS Study Drug 3  (as soon as possible) . If treating physicians  discontinue clinically prescribed 
corticosteroids, or reduce the total daily dose to less than 200 mg of hydrocortisone daily (or equivalent), VICTAS Study Drug 3 will be restarted  (as soon as possible)  if this occurs within the first 96 hours 
following randomization, and  the patient remains in the ICU.

8.4. Study Drug Packaging and  Preparation  
 
The FDA approved commercial products of each study medication will be procured from McGuff 
Pharmaceuticals and  shipped to the central coordinating pharmacy (CCP) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Matching placebos will be procured  by [CONTACT_314100] a manufacturer, distributor, and/or 
supplier. All three study drugs and placebo supplies will be tagged as investigational product and coded 
with unique identification numbers linking each vial to the matching kit.   
STUDY DRUG HANDLING  
 
All commercial products and placebos will arrive to the CCP in their commercial formulation and 
packaging directly from a manufacturer, distributor, and/or supplier. All three study drugs and placebos will be tagged as investigational product and coded with unique identification numbers. Study drugs and 
placebos will be packed into study kits. The exterior of kits will be blinded and identic al in size, shape, 
and color. Each kit will be identified with a unique code (i.e., randomization number) and the kits contents 
will have matching codes. After unsealing study drug kits, site phar macists will be UNBLINDED to 
randomization assignment.  Site pharm acists are prohibited from informing anyone of study drug 
assignment.   Overview of CCP labeling and packaging pr ocess for study drugs:  
1. Receive medication / placebo  
2. Visual inspection of medication to ensure vial integrity  
3. Label study drug (active agent or placebo) with appropriate identification and coding (i.e., randomization number and/or kit number) and label pr oduct for investigation use only 
4. Package study drugs in appropriate kits  
5. Label and seal exterior of kit  
6. Ship study drug kits to sites in appropriate shippi[INVESTIGATOR_35275] (see storage and temperature control)  
7. Ensure drugs are received by [CONTACT_314101].   The CCP will NOT perform any compounding of medications.  
 Final verification of all study drugs will be completed by [CONTACT_314102].   
 Local sites pharmacies will compound and dispense medications as required and as outlined below.

  Page 26 of 64  
VICTAS Study Drug 1 : Blinded, multi- dose vials of either 25,000 mg / 50 mL of commercial ASCOR 
(ascorbic acid, McGuff pharmaceuticals) or 50 mLs of dextrose 5% will be distributed to sites and 
stored at 2 -8 degrees Celsius. After randomization, site pharmacies will locate th e specified kit using 
the unique identification code. Three (3) mLs will be removed from the study drug  vial and 
compounded into a 50 mL infusion bag of dextrose 5%. The site pharmacy will label the compounded drug as investigational product and place in light protected bag. The study drug  vials will expi[INVESTIGATOR_314053] 
(4) hours after first puncture. Site pharmacies will prepare up to four (4) doses from one (1) study drug  
vial as determined by [CONTACT_314103]. The compounded infusion bags ma y be 
stored for up to 24 hours at 2- 8 degrees Celsius. If more than one (1) infusion bag is compounded from 
the same study drug vial and stored for subsequent doses, the site will be responsible for maintaining 
appropriate accountability for the investigat ional product.  
 
VICTAS Study Drug [ADDRESS_386627] be protected from light using the provided opaque bag after compounding and  while being administered. 
Light protected tubing is not required during administration. Each dose will be administered over 30 minutes through a dedicated IV line  (i.e., infused separately and should not administered concurrently 
with any other medications or study drugs) at the frequency and dose described above.   
 
VICTAS Study Drug 2 : Blinded, single -dose, light -protected vials of either thiamine 200 mg / 2 mLs 
or 2 mL normal saline  solution for placebo will be provided to sites and stored at 15- 30 degrees Celsius. 
After randomization, site pharmacies will locate the specified vial using the unique identification code. One (1) mL of thiamine or placebo will be withdrawn into a syringe using standard IV drug preparation techniques. The syringe will be labeled as investigational product (VICTAS Study Drug 2) and administered via slow IV push over 2 -3 minutes at the frequency and dose as described above. One (1) 
mL of thiamine or placebo will be wasted.   VICTAS Study Drug 3 : Blinded, single -dose vials of hydrocortisone [ADDRESS_386628] IV drug preparation and reconstitution technique, 2 mLs of diluent (sterile water or saline) will be added to the hydrocortisone powder, agitated and allowed proper time to reconstitute. One (1) mL of hydrocortisone or placebo will be withdrawn via syringe, labeled as investigational product (VICTAS Study Drug 3) and dispensed to the bedside. Study drug 3 will be administered via slow IV push over 2- 3 minutes at 
the frequency and dose as describe above.  
8.5. Investigational New Drug (IND)  
 The VICTAS Trial received an IND exemption from the FDA on 1/11/2018, which applies to all three 
VICTAS study drugs. The o fficial FDA letter has been uploaded a part of the IRB application.  
 This is a clinical evaluation of the FDA -approved drugs: ASCOR (ascorbic acid), thiamine hydrochloride 
(thiamine), and Solu- cortef (hydrocortisone), for an off- label indication and accordingly meets regulatory 
criteria (21 CFR Sec. 312.2(b)(1)) for an exemption, which has been granted by [CONTACT_1622]. Exemption is based on the following criteria: (1) the drug products are lawfully marketed in the [LOCATION_002], (2) the investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well -controlled study in support of a new 
indication and there is no intent to use it to support any other significant change in the labeling of the 
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, 2019 
    
 
  Page 27 of 64 drugs, (3) in the case of prescription drugs, the investigation is not intended to support a significant change 
in the advertising for the drugs, (4) the investigation does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or other factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreases t he acceptability of the 
risk) associated with the use of the drug products, (5) the investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by [CONTACT_118679], and (6) the investigation is not intended to promote or commercialize the drug products.   
Treatment Compliance and Discontinuation  
 
Interruptions of study drug administration should be avoided as much as possible.  Missed doses of 
VICTAS study drugs may be administered up to 3 hours after the scheduled administration time (one 
additional hour from + 2 hours window), but should be administered as soon as possible after the scheduled time. Any study drug interruptions will be recorded, including the reason for the interruption.  When a research subject is discharged from the ICU prior to completing the full [ADDRESS_386629] the 24/7 Trial Physician Phone Line for safety concerns or questions regarding  complete or partial study intervention termination.  The 
date, time, and reason for early intervention discontinuation will be provided and documented. Subjects 
will not be withdrawn from the study and should be followed per protocol.  The local site PI [INVESTIGATOR_314054].  The DCC will prepare  reports of these incidents as needed for communication to the CCC  who will then report to  
the SIRB, and/or the DSMB.    
8.6. Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_314055] a pharmacologic agent for sepsis will not be eligible 
for enrollment in the VICTAS trial. Any patient enrolled in another trial that requires administration of 
vitamin C, thiamine or hydrocortisone will not be eligible for enrollment in the VICTAS trial.  
  
Subjects may receive Vitamin C, thiamine, or hydrocor tisone during the course of the study at the 
discretion of their treating physicians with the following stipulations: 
  
Vitamin C  
● May be given for known or suspected vitamin C deficiency (i.e. scurvy). 
● May not be given at doses greater than 1g daily (total  daily dose) – either orally or 
intravenously. 
● Any administration of vitamin C outside of study protocol will be recorded and registered.  
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, 2019 
    
 
  Page 28 of 64   
Thiamine  
● May be given for known or suspected thiamine deficiency (e.g., prevention of Werni cke’s 
encephalopathy in chronic alcoholics or malnourished patients).  
  
Hydrocortisone 
● As detailed previously, the use of hydrocortisone will be allowed at the discretion of the primary 
clinical teams.  Refer to section discussing steroid management for further detail.  
● The use of other steroid agents will be allowed, and will be converted to hydrocortisone equivalent doses for the purposes of determining the details of Study Drug 3 (see APPENDIX A).  Subjects on chronic steroids will not be excluded from enrollment.   
 
8.7. Drug Storage, Accounting and Disposal 
   Storage – All study drugs will be stored on site and are expected to remain stable for months under the 
pre-specified temperature control. Expi[INVESTIGATOR_314056]. Study drug(s) will be sent to sites prior to the expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659].    Accountability  – The CCC and Central Pharmacy will provide management of ensuring appropriate 
amount of study drug is at each site. Sites will maintain appr opriate and accurate drug accountability.  
 Drug Disposal  – Any expi[INVESTIGATOR_314057]. Study drugs that are administered and have left over product 
requiring w asting do not require documentation on the accountability record.

(using systems established at local sites). The study team will determine if the patient meets the basic 
inclusion criteria for presumptive eligibility (detailed above).  
  The investigator or designee will respond to the ED or ICU in order to verify  patient eligibility based on 
the full inclusion/exclusion checklist. If the patient meets the basic inclusion criteria, the investigator or designee will review the enrollment criteria with the clinical care team to confirm eligibility. All screen failures will be recorded on the Screen Failure Log. To maintain compliance with recruitment procedures, 
sepsis admissions should be reviewed weekly by a research team member to determine if any eligible cases were missed and to identify local barriers to enrollm ent.  
  It is anticipated that each site will enroll on average 2 subjects per month.  
 
Eligibility Verification:  The eligibility CRF must be completed  prior to randomization to ensure all 
inclusion and exclusion criteria have been confirmed. If eligibility questions arise, the CCC/National Hotline should be contact[CONTACT_10003].  
 Informed Consent: Informed consent must be obtained bef ore any study specific procedures are done. 
The investigator (or designee) will give the subject or subject’s legally authorized representative (LAR ) 
information  about the trial in a form that they can read and understand. The consent process and date of 
informed consent given by [CONTACT_29159]’s LAR will be documented in the subject’s files and carried out in accordance with state and institutional regulations. In the case where the subject is unable 

  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, [ADDRESS_386632]’s LAR (in accordance with applicable law) may provide consent for the 
patient.   Subjects will be assessed regularly during trial participation for return of cognitive function and their ability to provide informed consent. The subject will be informed about the trial  if and when he/she 
becomes able to provide informed consent, and the subject will be given the opportunity to continue trial participation or withdraw.  If the subject consents to continue in the trial, the subject will be requested to sign a consent form.  If consent is denied by [CONTACT_423], he/she will be withdrawn from the trial however, data obtained under LAR consent will be retained. If a subject dies before becoming able to consent, then the rights to trial data will remain with the LAR. The consen t process should be clearly documented in the 
subject’s medical record.  
 
9.3. Enrollment and Randomization 
 
Subjects are considered enrolled in the trial after informed consent and a randomization code (kit number) 
is provided. To enroll and randomize a patient, the enrolling investigator or designee confirms eligibility criteria is met and enters the required data into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) portal. After all required data for entry is entered and no violations are present, the EDC will provide a randomization code / kit number.     
 
9.4. Subject Tracking and Loss to Follow-up 
 The local study team will collect extensive contact [CONTACT_314104]-term outcomes assessment . To attain 
a high rate of long-term follow up (>90%), the study team will request multiple phone numbers (home, 
cell phones, pagers, etc) and addresses from the subject and his/her relatives, friends, primary doctor (if available), cle rgy and clinics. At the time of consent and enrollment, proxy respondents will be asked to 
provide the telephone number of the place where the subject will likely reside following discharge. At the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], each subject’s disposition will be noted (nursing home, rehabilitation facility, another acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], subject’s home, relative’s home, etc) so plans can be made for long-term 
outcomes telephone follow -up. Date of birth (used for death records and tracking patients) will also be  
obtained and kept with the secure subject ID key.   
Subjects cannot be deemed “Lost to Follow -Up” (LTF) without Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) 
approval. The site investigator or long -term outcomes assessment team must present a case to the CCC 
that includes the efforts exerted to locate the study subject. Investigator may be asked to continue their 
efforts prior to approval.

10.1. Data Collection and Timelines  
 
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC), CCC or its designee will instruct the study site regarding data capture procedures on electronic and/or paper Case Report Forms (CRFs).  At each site, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported for each patient. Source documentation supporting the data should indicate the patient’s participation in the study and should document the dates and details of study procedures, adverse events, and patient status.  The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete data entry as soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a study patient is seen for an examination, treatment, or any other study procedure. Any outstanding entries must be completed immediately after the final examination. An explanation should be given for all missing data. The Investigator must sign and date the Investigator’s Statement that will be supplied to endorse the recorded data.

remain in the ICU that long)  
b Data will be abstracted from Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Abstracted data will include baseline data , and daily data.  For baseline data, use most 
abberant elements from the 24 hours preceding the time of randomization.  For daily values, use data from  as close to 8 a.m. as is possible up to day 5 or 
ICU discharge (whichever occurs first). Vasopressor doses will only be recorded at time of randomization.   After randomization  day, only report the use of

  Page 34 of 64 10.3. Laboratory assessments  
 
Though specific laboratory data or results are not required for eligibility, it is expected that various 
laboratory tests will routinely be performed by [CONTACT_314107]. When available, recorded lab data should be from values as close to 8 a.m. daily up to day 5 or ICU discharge (whichever occurs first, see schedule of events).  These tests include, but are not limited to: complete blood count including 
platelets with or without differential, chemistry including creatinine and total bilirubin, se rum lactate, 
coagulation studies, blood cultures, procalcitonin (PCT), C -reactive protein (CRP), urinalysis, and arterial 
or venous blood gas.    Note, women of child bearing age who have not undergone a sterilization procedure cannot be considered 
for enrollment unless the clinical teams has demonstrated they are not pregnant via a negative pregnancy 
test as part of routine care.  
 Due to the potential for errors in some point of care glucometers in the setting of high serum vitamin C concentrations (see s ection 3.5), participating sites will be required to measure glucose using a point of 
care device that has been validated for use in the setting of high vitamin C concentrations 
81, or use 
devices validated for high vitamin C concentrations81 in their critical care or central laboratory. If 
glucose is measured in a critical care of central laboratory, approximately one milliliter of blood will be obtained from an artery or vein. The number of blood draws will depend on each patient’s needs and the number of glucose measurements clinical care providers order.  For sites that do not have a valid point of 
care glucometer, and do not want to use their critical care or central laboratory, Nova Biomedical has agreed to loan sites two Nova StatStrip devices, a charg ing station, and test strips.  Nova Biomedical will 
also provide on- site training in the use of the devices.  Of note, use of loaned devices in this study will 
require the use of venous or arterial (approximately one drop of blood per measurement) samples and NOT fingersticks.  The number samples will depend on each patient’s needs and the number of glucose 
measurements clinical care providers order . Loaned StatStrip glucometers will be validated on site as 
detailed in the “Procedure Manual” uploaded with this application . Sites that already use a glucometer 
that has been validated for use in the setting of high vitamin C concentrations should measure glucose according to their usual protocol.    
10.4. Clinical Assessments and Procedures  
 Baseline Data  - At enrollmen t, basic information about disease characteristics and the subject, including 
common sepsis and research related variables will be collected. Examples include:  
● Demographics 
o Age 
o Race/Ethnicity  
o Gender 
o Education 
● Anthropometrics 
● Source of Admission 
● Comorbidities and Medical History  
● History and Physical (brief physical exam findings) 
● APACHE II (ICU mortality)  – using the most aberrant data from the 24 hours preceding the 
time of randomization

● Vasopressor requirements  
● Respi[INVESTIGATOR_314059] 
● Total volume of fluid resuscitation  
● Presumed infection source and organism 
● Initial antimicrobial therapy  
● CAM-ICU 
 
Daily Measurements and Physiologic Data: 
 Use data that is obtained as close to 8 a.m. each day while the pat ient is in the ICU up to day 5.  
● Vital Signs (MAP, HR, RR, and Temp) 
● CAM-ICU Score  
● SOFA Score  
● Study Drug Compliance 
 
Additional Measures to be determined and collected at time of ICU discharge and/or Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138007]:  
● Daily Vasopressor Requirements  
● Daily Ventilator / Respi[INVESTIGATOR_314060]  
● Antimicrobial therapy  
● Final infectious source data  
● Location and/or disposition 
 
Outcome Assessments – The primary outcome measure is VVFD at 30 days (+/ -3 days) after 
randomization. Vasopressor and venti lator-free days will be determined by [CONTACT_314108]. Additional measures will include renal replacement therapy (RRT) free days and 
determination of subject’s vital status. These will be assessed at ICU discharge, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314061] 30 (whichever comes first) . The final study visit for individual sites will be the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314062] 30 (whichever comes first) . For patients discharged prior to day 30, status at discharge 
will be assumed to refle ct outcome at day 30.  
 
Long Term Outcome Assessments Sub -Study - Explicit subject consent for participation in long term 
telephone follow -up will be sought for all patients at all sites.  Participation in long term outcome 
assessments is not required for participation in other aspects of the VICTAS study. Subjects who participate will be compensated fifteen dollars. In these participants a diverse array of neurocognitive outcomes will be assessed approximately 6 months after patient discharge. Evaluations will be done using a specially -designed battery of tests that evaluates key aspects of functioning and behavior and will be 
administered via phone by [CONTACT_314109] -Term Outcomes team, which will serve as the 
coordinating center for these follow -up assessments. The battery, which takes about 40 minutes to 
complete, will assess cognition, mental health (depression and PTSD), quality of life, and employment - 
all of which have been shown to be adversely affected in between one third and two thirds of survivors of sepsis. This battery has been successfully used by [CONTACT_314110] - it is well tolerated by [CONTACT_1962], easy to administer and to understand, and is very 
sensitive to the detection of even  minor difficulties. Tests comprising the battery ( by [CONTACT_314111] ) 
are as follows :

10.5. Efficacy Measures  
 
All patients who are randomized will be included in the ITT analysis population. Patients will be analyzed as randomized. The ITT analysis will be the primary efficacy analysis population (see study design and statistical considerations).  
 For the ITT population, missing primary or secondary endpoints due to death will be imputed as failure for the primary efficacy endpoint. Secondary endpoints will be assigned the worst possible values for all analyses.   
 
10.6. Adverse Event Reporting  
 Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical studies are crucial for the protection o f patients, investigators and study sponsors. For the purposes of this study, 
adverse events will be defined and reported using the Terms and Classifications  and Adverse Event  
Reporting Rules  outlined and summarized in a diagram below :  
   
Terms and Classi fications:  
 
Adverse Event:  An adverse event (AE) is considered any untoward medical occurrence in a human subject, 
including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in  research, whether or not considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research.   
 
Expected Adverse Events  
It is recognized that the patient population with sepsis, septic shock and related forms of critical illness who require ICU care will experience a number of common abnormalities in laboratory values, signs, and symptoms due to the severity of the underlying disease and the impact of standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Examples of these expected events include, but are not limited to:  
· Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]  
· Heart failure  
· Pneumonia or other / new infection 
· DVT or PE  
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, 2019 
    
 
  Page 37 of 64 · Complications related to ICU procedures  
· Death 
· Arrhythmia  
· Delirium 
· Bowel ischemia  
· Ileus 
· Leukopenia or leukocytosis 
· Anemia or thrombocytopenia 
· Coagulopathy (DIC) 
· Hypoglycemia  
· Electrolyte abnormalities  
 
In addition, planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314063], or before randomization, will also not be considered study related AEs. None of these expected adverse event s will be considered study related AE s, unless the events : 
(1) Are felt by [CONTACT_314112] (See Table Below), or  
(2) Lead to discontinuation of Investigational Product. 
 
Potentially Associated Adve rse Events (PAAE):   Based on the reported potential risks of vitamin C, 
thiamine, and/or hydrocortisone, several important risks have been identified that could be associated with administration of one or all three drugs and have been labeled as “potential ly associated adverse events” 
(PAAE). All PAAEs occurring following randomization through the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314064]. Identified PAAEs include but are not limited to  nephrolithiasis, 
hemolysis, (refer to Section 13.[ADDRESS_386633]).   
 
Serious Adverse Event:  A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that occurs during the study (ie, after 
randomization through to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191606] 30 follow -up [whichever occurs first] ), that fulfills 
one or more of the following criteria:  
1. Results in death (for the purposes of this trial, deaths will be captured as clinical outcomes and only recorded as an SAE if deemed related to the investigational product) 
2. Is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred) 
3. Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] 
4. Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; OR  
6. Is an important and significant medical event. (Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition).  
 
Serious and Unexpected Adverse E vent 
Serious Adverse Events (see above) that are Unexpected  (i.e. not consistent with the natural history of 
the disease under study) and deemed to be definitely or possibly study -related will be reported in an 
expedited manner to the DSMB (see Reporting R ules below).  
 Relationship to Investigational Product 
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, [ADDRESS_386634] is a clinical 
decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the EDC. Research relatedness 
will be evaluated according to the following definitions : 
 
 UNRELATED  The temporal relationship between treatment exposure and the adverse event is 
unreasonable or incompatible and/or adverse event is clearly due to extraneous causes 
(e.g., underlying disease, environment)  
UNLIKELY  Must have both of the following  [ADDRESS_386635] reasonable or only tenuous 
temporal relationship to intervention:  
1. Could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, or environmental or 
other interventions.  
2. Does not follow known pattern of response to intervention.  
REASONABLE 
POSSIBILITY  Must have at least 2  of the following 3 conditions:  
1. Has a reasonable temporal relationship to intervention. 
2. Could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or environmental or other interventions.  
3. Follows a known pattern of response to intervention.  
DEFINITE  Must have all 3 of the following conditions:  
1. Has a reason able temporal relationship to intervention.  
2. Could not possibly have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or have been due to environmental or other interventions.  
3. Follows a known pattern of response to intervention.  
 
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting Rules 
All research -related AEs, PAAEs and SAEs will be submitted electronically through the EDC.  
 
A. Timing of reporting and duration of tracking:  
 
AE reporting : All research -related non-serious AEs will be recorded up to the first 5 days after enrollment 
(up to [ADDRESS_386636] infusion)  and will be reported on the AE page of the EDC , 
and will be summarized at quarterly intervals for DSMB review and summarized and reported for the 
annual IRB continual renewal.  
 PAAE reporting : All non-serious PAAEs occurring following randomization through the acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314065], and will be summarized at quarterly intervals for 
DSMB review  and summarized and reported for the annual IRB continual renewal.   PAAEs deemed to be serious will be reported as per the SAE reporting process below . 
 
SAE reporting : All SAEs occurring following randomization through the acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314066]  30-days 
after enrollment , whichever comes first, that are unexpected and deemed to be study related  will be

  Page 39 of 64 reported by [CONTACT_314113] C 
without delay.    
 These events (both PAAEs and SAE) will be followed (by [CONTACT_7880]) for  outcome until 
resolution/stabilization or until [ADDRESS_386637].  
  
B. Reporting Procedures 
 
i. General Reporting Guideline: 
The site investigator, study coordinator, or designee is responsible f or entering all AEs and SAEs and 
updating the information (e.g., date of resolution, action taken) in a timely manner. SAEs meeting criteria should be submitted within 72 hours. 
  
AE, PAAE and SAE reports will include, but are not limited to:  the adverse event term, subject identifier, 
description of the event, concomitant medication used to treat the adverse event, Investigator assessment of causal relationship to the Investigational Product and/or research participation and any other relevant information.   
ii. Reporting of SAEs to the DCC: 
The Investigator or designee will complete an electronic SAE Report Form, assess the causal relationship to study procedure/intervention, and enter the information in the EDC system. This initial report should describe whether the SAE has resolved or is continuing, if and how it was treated, and whether the subject continued or permanently discontinued study participation.    The DCC will review all site submitted SAEs to determine if the event is indeed an SAE.   In some cases, 
submitted SAEs may be downgraded to a PAAE.  Such PAAEs will not be forwarded to the Medical 
Monitor or CCC, but instead be reviewed in aggregate along with other PAAEs at quarterly intervals for 
DSMB review and summarized and reported for the annual IRB continual renewal.    
 
The DCC  will then contact [CONTACT_314114].  The CCC will report to the DSMB chair for review per the DSMB 
charter. If an ongoing SAE significantly worsens in its inten sity or the relationship to study drug changes 
significantly, follow-up information will be provided by [CONTACT_314115] 72 hours 
of knowledge of this new information using the same procedure as described for transmitting the initia l 
report. Based on reports delivered to the DCC, the CCC will report SAEs following S IRB criteria.  
 
 
iii. Reporting to the IRB:  
All PAAEs and SAEs will be reported as described above to the JHU SIRB in accordance with SIRB reporting requirements and may b e reported locally, as determined to be required by [CONTACT_314116].  
 If IRB reporting is determined to be required by [CONTACT_314117], the Investigator or designee will inform their local IRB of the SAE and provide them with all relevant initial and f ollow-up information. If only 
limited information is available during the initial 72-hour reporting time frame, then follow -up 
information will be provided promptly when it becomes  available. If an ongoing SAE significantly

Biomarkers and Pharmacokinetic Sampling  – At select study sites with the requisite experience and 
infrastructure for timed specimen collection, processing, storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], we will carry out baseline 
and timed measurements of Vitamin C (ascorbate), thiamine and cortisol, in order to charac terize the 
relationship between these substances to disease severity, progression of disease and response to treatment. We will also assess baseline levels and pharmacokinetics of varied biomarkers associated with sepsis progression and response to therapy, in order to define the clinical utility of these biomarkers in the context of the TP. Sepsis biomarkers to be assessed will include complete blood count with differential, serum lactate, procalcitonin, C -reactive protein, and F2 isoprostane (a reliable s ensitive 
biomarker of oxidative stress).    See table below.  Initial blood and urine samples will be obtained after informed consent but prior to 
first study drug or placebo administration. The second sample  collection  will occur [ADDRESS_386638] administration of all 3 study drugs is complete

displayed. Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_314118]. All summaries and analyses will be performed using data p ooled across centers. 
 
11.2. Power and Sample Size 
 The trial has a flexible sample size that will be determined adaptively  using a “Goldilocks” strategy  with 
an initial enrollment target of up to  500 subjects . Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either the Treatment Protocol (TP) or Control Protocol (CP), plus standard of care treatment (hereafter referred to in a combined manner as the “Study Intervention” or “Intervention”).   Our analytical approach maximizes the potential for the trial to detect benefit, if it exists, by [CONTACT_314119] a moderate effect on the VVFD endpoint  (described in further detail below) , while also 
allowing the trial to stop early if a very large effect is observed on our secondary outcome of mortality. This approach is desirable because an isolated study suggests a very strong effect on mortality (reference 
20), yet clinical and research experience (references 18 and 19) suggest such a strong mortality benefit is unlikely and that more modest, but clinically meaningful, effects will be observed. Since we cannot preclude the possible large mortality benefit, we will check for it at the earliest adaptations. If the very large effect on mortality is not observed, we will continue enrollment with frequent inte rims that may stop 
the trial for benefit on VVFD . We will perform early interim analyses of the mortality endpoint when 
N=200, 300, and [ADDRESS_386642] at any point, enrolled 
patients complete the study protocol for all outcome assessments and the primary analysis will be conducted with the complete data (see section 6: Study Design for additional detai ls).. 
 Using a conservative estimate of the potential mortality difference of 20%, compared to the 32% mortality difference observed by [CONTACT_314097], et al.
20, the study has a power exceeding 90% in a one -sided test of 
proportions with alpha = 0.001. As such, the study is highly powered and very likely to stop at one of the interim analyses if the 20% treatment effect is real. If a more moderate treatment effect applies, the trial is more likely to continue beyond 500 subjects and would achieve lower power for the mortality endpoint.   
If the data are indeterminate on mortality after enrolling 400 patients, the trial may continue to a larger sample size (up to 2000).  
For the primary outcome measure (VVFD), we will use an adaptive strat egy with assessments at 500, 
1000, 1500, or 2000 subjects randomized to either the TP or CP.  When the data are sufficiently strong on the primary endpoint (VVFD), the trial may select a smaller sample size, but when necessary (e.g. for a moderate effect),  the trial may continue to a larger sample size.  
 The overall Type I error rate for the trial is controlled at 2.5%. The early interims at N=200, 300, 400 are designed to conservatively spend alpha so that 2.4% remains for the analysis at N=500 (or beyond) .

  Page 43 of 64 Anticipated alpha expenditures at all interim analyses, determined through clinical trial simulation, are as 
follows:  
 
Interim Analysis  Alpha Spend  
N = 200  0.0002 
N = 300  <0.0001 
N = 400  0.0003 
N = 500  0.010 
N = 1000  0.0026 
N = 1500  0.0033 
 
The power estimates used for sample size selection if the trial progresses to N=500 and beyond were also 
determined through clinical trial simulatio n, and take into account both the primary outcome of VVFD 
and the secondary mortality outcome . Indeed, these  two outcomes are inter -related, with our primary 
efficacy endpoint (VVFD) representing a combination of treatment effect on mortality (all deaths are recorded as zero VVFD) and  effect on vasopressor and ventilator support dependence  in survivors. Full 
details of these simulations, over a wide range of assumptions, may be found in a separate document 
entitled VICTAS Trial Adaptive Design Report .  
 
11.3. Analysis Sets  
 
11.3.1. Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set  
 All randomized subjects will be included in the ITT analysis  set. The ITT population will be used for all 
primary, secondary, and other efficacy analyses. In these analyses, subjects will be classified according to the treatment randomized (not actual treatment received).  
 
11.3.2. Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set  
 Patients in the PP analysis must meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria. All subjects who are included in the ITT analysis set, receive at least 4 doses of study drug/placebo, and did not have major 
protocol deviations will be included in the PP analy sis set. Major protocol violations will be identified 
prior to the unblinding of the study at the final analysis. Note, patie nts who die, or are discharged from 
the ICU before [ADDRESS_386643] completed follow up. If the trial 
stops for expected success on the mortality endpoint at N=200, 300, or 400, the final analysis will be based solely on mortality and will require p<0.001. If the trial reaches N=500 or mor e without predicted success 
on mortality, indicating more moderate effects, the primary analysis will be based on the more sensitive VVFD endpoint using the remaining 2.4% alpha.

  Protocol version date:  April 22, 2019 
    
 
  Page 44 of 64  
11.4.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is vasopressor and  ventilator -free days (VVFD) in the first [ADDRESS_386644] return to ventilation and/or vasopressors will have their counters reset at zero days. If the trial reaches N=[ADDRESS_386645] (also 
known as a Mann- Whitney U test), which will be performed using a one -sided alpha of 0.022. If the study 
is extended beyond N=500, then the final analysis on VVFD requires p<0.022. This p-value threshold was 
selected through simulations in order to control type I error and account for the m ultiple analyses at 
N=500, 1000, 1500 and 2000.  The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT population. A sensitivity analysis will be performed on the PP analysis set.  
 
For subjects with missing data on the primary endpoint, a “last status carried forward” approach will be 
used. If a subject was last seen on either vasopressors or mechanical ventilation, it is assumed that the subject remained so, and is imputed to a value of zero VVFD. If the subject was last seen off of vasopressors and mechanical  ventilation  and is not known to be dead, it is also assumed that the subject 
remained so in the remainder of the 30-day period.  VVFDs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_314120].  
11.4.2. Key Secondary Endpoint 
 The mortality endpoint will be tested using a Chi- square test. If the trial stops accrual at N=200, 300, or 
400, all subjects will be followed and the primary analysis will be based on mortality, with trial success 
defined as p<0.001. If the trial  reaches N=[ADDRESS_386646] will be performed on the ITT 
population. A sensitivity analysis will be performed on the PP analysis set.  
11.4.3. Additional Efficacy Endpoints 
 The following endpoints will be analyzed as supportive evidence of treatment benefit. The tests will not be included in the gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_63966], so that type I error will not be adjusted for multiple testing:

  Page 45 of 64 11.4.4. Safety Endpoints  
 
Complete listings and summary tables for all safety information will be presented for subjects who are included in the Safety analysis set. Descriptive statistics (number and percentage) for adverse events and serious adverse events will be presented by [CONTACT_94535]. No formal statistical analysis will be performed.  
 
11.5. Interim Analyses  
 Interim analyses of mortality will be conducted at N=200, 300, and 400. If the predictive probability of 
achieving p<0.001 on mortality exceeds 90%, the trial will stop accrual and all current patients will be followed until completion. When all subjects are complete, the primary analysis will consist of determining if the p -value on mortality is less than 0.001. 
 If the data are indeterminate on mortality at N=200, 300, or 400 subjects, the trial may continue to a larger sample size (up to 2000) using an adaptive strategy based on the primary endpoint of VVFD with assessments at 500, 1000, 1500, or 2000 subjects randomized to either the TP or CP.  At each interim, we 
will compute the predictive probability that VVFD will be significant if the trial continues  follow up with 
the currently enrolled sample size, and if the trial continues to its maximum sample size of N=2000.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_314068] S ection 6: Study Design.  
 
11.5.1. Statistical Models for the Interim Analysis  
 At the time of each interim analysis, there will be subjects for whom the final outcome is unknown (e.g. subjects who are enrolled but whose data is not yet available, or future subjects not yet enrolled). To make decisions regarding sample size selection, Bayesian predictive distributions are employed for the multiple imputation of outcomes for such subjects. These models will play no role in the final analysis,  but rather 
are only used to facilitate the early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_314069].  
 
Predictive Probabilities for Mortality  
 
To compute predictive probabilities for the mortality endpoint alone, we rely on a Beta -Binomial model, 
with independent non-informative Beta(0.5, 0.5) priors on each q
j, where q j is the mortality rate on arm j.  
Based on this model, we compute: 
 
● PPmort (current N): the predictive probability of success on the mortality endpoint 
(Chi square test) if enrollment stops at the current sample size, and all currently enrolled subjects are followed to their primary outcome. 
● PP
mort (max N): the predictive probability of success on the mortality endpoint (Chi 
square test) if enrollment continues to the maximum sample size (N=2000), and all subjects are followed to their primary outcome. 
 Similarly, we compute predictive probabilities for the VVFD endpoint using a model based on an exponential family (additional details of the model may be found in a separate document en titled 
VICTAS Trial Adaptive Design Report ): 
 
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, 2019 
    
 
  Page 46 of 64 ● PPVVFD (current N): the predictive probability of success on the VVFD endpoint 
(Wilcoxon test) if enrollment stops at the current sample size, and all currently 
enrolled subjects are followed to their primary outcome. 
● PPVVFD (max N): the predictive probability o f success on the VVFD endpoint 
(Wilcoxon test) if enrollment continues to the maximum sample size (N=2000), and all subjects are followed to their primary outcome.

  Page 47 of 64 12. Data Management  
 
Data management will be handled by [CONTACT_314122] (DCC) at Vanderbilt University 
Medical Center (VUMC). All activities will be conducted in coordination with the study PI, the sites and VICTAS Executive Committees. The data validation procedure will be implemented on two levels: first,  
automated checks will display warnings for invalid data, and second, the DCC team will verify individual data fields and query discrepancies. More information can be found in the Monitoring Plan.  
12.1. Investigator Responsibilities for Data Management  
 The Investigator will allow direct access to source data/documents for trial related monitoring, auditing, 
IRB/EC review, and regulatory inspection. Also, the investigator will allow auditing of their clinical investigational procedure(s). Source documents are defined as original documents, data and records. For 
the duration of the study, the Investigator will maintain complete and accurate documentation including but not limited to medical records, study progress records, laboratory reports, case report forms, s igned 
informed consent forms, drug accountability records, correspondence with the CCC, DCC, IRB, and DSMB, adverse event reports, and information regarding subject discontinuation or completion of the study. 
 
12.2. Data Collection and Handling 
 The entire study will be conducted using an electronic data acquisition method where all research related 
data on enrolled subjects will be entered (single -keyed) by [CONTACT_14523]. This web- based data 
management system entitled Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system, provides a user -
friendly and easy -to-navigate interface. The latest version of each electronic case report form (eCRF) and 
source document worksheets (as applicable) will be available as a PDF file on the REDCap website for use by [CONTACT_3462]. This web- based database housing the eCRFs has been designed for the study, 
which will improve efficiency, lower cost of the study, and expedite publication of the results. Use of drop-down selection lists, radio buttons, checkboxes, and validation checks will be incorporated to aid the 
speed, accuracy and consistency of data entry. The database will be backed up regularly.   
12.3. Data Acquisition and Central Study Database  
 Each site will be required to have a local coordinator who will be responsible for ent ering the study 
information into the web- based database and uploading the non- redacted, identifiable source 
documents/medical records associated with the study information. In order to verify data entered into the study database, source documentation containing protected health information will be uploaded for cross -
reference and source verification. This will include medical records containing clinical information for the purposes of screening up until the participant's last day on the study that is releva nt to the research 
study. 
 The web-based Randomization Module will be used by [CONTACT_314123]. The Study Coordinator (or other appropriate study team member) will log onto the REDCap system using a unique username [CONTACT_314149]. When a subject is deemed eligible, a unique subject ID and record will be generated in REDCap. Once the Study Coordinator has entered the required subject information and clicked “Randomize”, the c omputer program will display the 
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, [ADDRESS_386647] Retention 
 In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_314071] (Vanderbilt University M edical Center ) data retention regulations, study records 
will be retained at all sites for a minimum of [ADDRESS_386648] been satisfied.  
 
12.5. Data Clarification Requests  
 Data for each participant should be entered by [CONTACT_314124]. The entered data will be checked and verified by [CONTACT_314125]. When a data point has been verified as accurate, the DCC will generate a green check beside that data entry field indicating that the data point has been verified. Any omissions, discrepancies, or inaccuracies among the data will be noted and the DCC team will issue a query. Site users will then be 
required to respond to the query. More information regarding query resolution can be found in the Monitoring Plan.  
 
12.6. Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is a departure from the approved protocol’s procedures made with or without prior IRB approval.  Such departures may be major or minor/administrative in nature (see below). 
Emergency  Deviations require prompt  reporting  to the IRB after they  occur 
Emergency deviations are those  occurring in an  emergency situation , such as when a departure from the 
protocol is required immediately to protect the life or physical well- being of a participant.   In such cases 
there is no time to prospectively seek the approva l of the IRB.  The CCC and the IRB of record must be 
notified as soon as possible, but not later than [ADDRESS_386649] approve before the 
proposed change is implemented (via submission of a Further Study Action for Change in Research in 
eIRB).  Examples include exceptions to eligibility criteria, exceptions to the form and manner of 
obtaining informed consent, and exceptions to the schedule of administration of an investigational 
product.   
If a planned major, non-emergent deviation occurs without prior IRB approval, the event is non-
compliance which must be reported promptly to the IRB via Further study Action for Protocol Event 
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, 2019

be managed in accordance with the Organization  Policy on Investigator Non -Compliance Policy  No. 
103.7. 
Minor or administrative protocol deviations require reporting  to the IRB at continuing  review 
Minor or administrative  deviations  are those wh ich do not “affect the scientific soundness of the 
research plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of human subjects.”  If a protocol deviation occurs which 
meets this definition, the deviation should be reported to the JHM IRB at the time the continuing r eview 
application is submitted.   Examples of minor or administrative deviations include: follow up visits 
occurring outside the protocol required time frame because of the participant’s schedule, or blood 
samples being obtained at times close to but not pr ecisely at the time points specified in the protocol.  
12.7. Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality 
 
VUMC employs several layers of data protection to ensure data security. The first part of security is 
physical protection of the hardware systems, access to which is limited to authorized personnel. By [CONTACT_314126], ensuring only authorized personnel ha ve access, and tracking all entry, we can ensure 
this risk is minimal. Additionally, REDCap has a built- in audit trail that tracks all user activity and 
changes made to the data entry fields with a date -time stamp.  
 
13.  Human Subjects Safety  
 
13.1. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
 
The study will be conducted according to Protection of Human Volunteers (21 CFR 50), Institutional 
Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and Obligations of Clinical Investigators (21 CFR 312). The VICTAS PIs, 
CCC, DCC, Medical Monitors, and Investigat ors must comply with all instructions, regulations, and 
agreements in this protocol. 
To maintain confidentiality, all laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports and other records will be 
identified by a coded number and initials only.  All study records will be kept in a locked file cabinet and code sheets linking a patient’s name [CONTACT_1639] a patient identification number will be stored separately in another locked file cabinet.  Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1622].  The Investigator must also comply with all applicable privacy regulations (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC). 
 
13.2. Institutional Review  Board 
 
The Johns Hopkins Medicine  IRB will act as the single IRB of record (SIRB) for the VICTAS protocol. 
JHM IRB will initiate reliance agreements with each participating site (and any affiliate, where necessary) 
through the SMART IRB mechanism.  All sites will be responsible for conducting a local context review, to ensure that the protocol is appropriate and reasonable for their respective study populations, however the JHM SIRB approval will serve as the IRB approval of record for the entire study. JH M IRB will 
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, [ADDRESS_386650] operating procedures and policies of the SIRB, and the study team will keep the SIRB informed as to the progress of the study.  Any documents that t he SIRB may need to fulfill its 
responsibilities (such as protocol, protocol amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms, information concerning patient recruitment, payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) will be submitted to the SIRB.  The SIRB written unconditional approval of the study protocol and the informed consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator before the study is initiated.  No study materials or supplies will be shipped to any participating s ite until S IRB approval of 
that site has been secured. The IRB unconditional approval statement will be transmitted by [CONTACT_314127].  This approval must refer  to the study by [CONTACT_314128].  
Protocol and/or informed consent modifications or changes may not be initiated without prior written SIRB approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patients or when the 
change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  Such modifications will be submitted to the SIRB and written verification that the modification was submitted and subsequent ly 
approved should be obtained.   
The SIRB must be informed of revisions to other documents originally submitted for review; serious 
and/or unexpected adverse experiences occurring during the study in accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the SIRB; new information that may affect adversely the safety of the patients of the conduct of the study; an annual update and/or request for re -approval; and when the 
study has been completed. 
 
13.3. Informed Consent 
 
Informed consent will be obtained in accordance with US Code of Federal Regulations for Protection of 
Human Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27, and CFR Part 56, Subpart A), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, if applicable), and local regulations. 
The CCC will prepare the informed consent form (ICF), assent and HIPAA authorization and provide the 
documents to the study team for approval prior to submission to the SIRB.  The consent form generated 
by [CONTACT_314129] d PI [INVESTIGATOR_314073], and be approved by [CONTACT_314130].  The written consent document will comply with local regulations. The CCC will send an SIRB -
approved copy of the Informed Consent Form to each site for the study file. 
A properly executed, written, informed consent will be obtained from each subject prior to entering the 
subject into the trial.  Information should be given in both oral and written form and subjects (or their legal representatives) must be given ample opportunity to inquire about details of the study.  If appropriate and required by [CONTACT_1036], assent from the subject will also be obtained.  If a subject is unable to sign the ICF and the HIPAA authorization, a legal representative may sign for the subject.   A copy of the signed consent form will be given to the subject or legal representative of the subject and the 
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, [ADDRESS_386651]’s records. As described in 9.2: Screening and Informed 
Consent, subjects will be assessed regularly during trial participation for retur n of cognitive function and 
their ability to provide informed consent. If the subject regains capacity during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 
written consent will be obtained directly from the study participant. In the event that a subject who 
regains capacity does n ot wish to continue study participation, this will be documented and no further 
study activity will be conducted. This includes any contact [CONTACT_314131]- term outcome assessments.  
 At the discretion of individual sites, patients whose primary language is not English may be enrolled. In such cases, a translated version of the ICF and HIPAA authorization will be provided to subjects or legal representatives in the primary language of the subject or legally authorized representative (LAR), as appropriate. All information, both oral and written, will be given in the primary language of the subject or LAR, both at the time of enrollment and at short term (in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) follow-up. Long term outcomes can 
only be performed in English.  
Consent for Long Term Outcome Assessments: At time of enrollment, subjects will be asked to provide 
explicit consent to long-term outcomes assessment. If subjects are not capable of providing consent due to cognitive impairment, explicit consent to long- term outcomes assessment  will be obtained from a 
qualified surrogate. Re -consenting of subjects who regain capacity during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314074]. For subjects who do not regain capacity to provide consent prior to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314075], the procedure for re-consenting and/or consenting to continued participation in the long term outcome portion of the study will be as detailed as below: 
 
Capacity for consent will be reassessed by [CONTACT_314132]- term outcomes study team at the time 
of the long- term follow -up. Patients will be judged to have regained capacity if they are able to 
speak on the phone and independently participate in conversation with the long- term outcome 
assessments study team member, as evidenced by [CONTACT_314133].   
For participants who have not regained capacity, LAR consent will remain valid and the Vanderbilt long-term outcomes team will proceed with the long -term outcome assessment.  
 For participants who have regained capacity, the long- term outcomes team will seek verbal consent 
from the participant for continued participation in ongoing research related to the VICTAS Trial. For participants who provide consent for ongoing participation, the long- term outcomes team will 
proceed with the long-term outcomes assessment. For participants who indicate they do not want to participate in ongoing research, this decision will be documented and the long- term outcomes 
assessment will not be performed. There will be no further contact [CONTACT_314134].  
 All procedures for re -consenting and/or consenting to continued participation in the long term outcome 
portion of the s tudy will be conducted in accordance with any applicable local IRB requirements and 
state laws.  Information about site- specific requirements for re -consent, when consent is initially 
obtained via LAR, will be collected from each relying site via the local context questio nnaire and 
submitted to the SIRB for consideration as part of the site on-boarding process.  We will also use our EDC database to record and keep track of site-specific requirements in order to ensure any plans for re-consent/consent for continued participation in the research are handled in accordance with site requirements. In the event that local state regulations or institutional policies require written re -consent 
once a participant regains capacity to consent or written consent for par ticipation in ongoing research, 
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, 2019 
    
 
  Page 52 of 64 the Vanderbilt long- term outcomes study team will facilitate the written consent process. This will occur 
via fax, mailing of consent forms with self -addressed and stamped return envelopes or other mechanism 
determined to co mply with applicable local/state law requirements.  
 
The Vanderbilt Long- Term Outcomes team will work closely with local coordinators to obtain contact 
[CONTACT_314135]. Specifically, addresses, multiple telephone numbers, and extensive contact [CONTACT_3031] (both for patients and for family members or friends who can assist us in locating patients) will be obtained and will be shared in the EDC database which will be accessible in 
“real time” to Vanderbilt coordinators.  Using well established strategies and “best practices” such as we’ve described above (i.e. obtaining multiple points of contact, building relationships with patients early in the process, etc.), we anticipate successfully assessing at least 90% of all eligible patients.  Follow-up models similar to those described here have been used across many multi- site outcome 
studies and IRB approval for such studies has always been obtained.  
 
 
13.4. Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
 
Data and safety monitoring will be carried out by  a designed Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
to ensure and maintain the scientific integrity and ethical balance of human subjects’ research , and to 
protect subjects from avoidable harm. Data review by [CONTACT_314136].  
 
The VICTAS Trial Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be composed of 5 individuals (2 emergency medicine clinicians, 2 critical care clinicians and 1  statistician) with specific content 
expertise in sepsis, multicenter clinical trials, and adaptive trial design and implementation. The DSMB will meet at least twice a year until study completion. The DSMB will report and advise the VICTAS Executive Committee. The DSMB is charged with ensuring that the trial is implemented as designed, that the prespecified design continues to be scientifically and ethically appropriate, and with reviewing ongoing safety data at the designated time points during the trial.  The DSMB’s obligation is to the 
continuing safety of trial subjects and those yet to be recruited to the trial, as well as the continuing validity and scientific merit of the trial in accordance with federal guidelines . 
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm127073.pdf ) 
 Acting independently of the Marcus Foundation, without interest in influencing the outcome of the study, DSMB member responsibilities include:  
● protecting the safety of the study participants from avoidable harm;  
● reviewing the charter, the research protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring and the informed consent template;  
● evaluating the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, recruitment, accrual and retention , participant risk versus benefit, performance of the trial sites 
and study, and other factors that can affect study safety and outcome; 
● reviewing interim analyses for safety issues and making recommendations in accordance with pre-specified safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_314076]; 
● making recommendations to the Executive committee chairs concerning continuation, termination or other modifications of the trial based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatm ent under study; 
  VICTAS Protocol version 1. 5 
  Protocol version date:  April 22, 2019 
    
 
  Page 53 of 64 ● considering factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as 
scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial; 
● making recommendati ons to assist in the resolution of problems reported by [CONTACT_24478]- and 
Principal Investigators or identified by [CONTACT_4318];  
● ensuring the study is conducted as designed, including the implementation of the adaptive algorithm; and  
● ensuring the confidentiality and blinding of study data and interim results.  
 DSMB meetings may be held  by [CONTACT_314137]. The planned interim DSMB meetings will include 
both open and closed sessions. Discussions held in all sessions are confidential. During an open session, the VICTAS PI, Executive Committee Chairs, or other designees may be present.  During open sessions, 
only information aggregated across treatment arms that does not threaten the integrity of the study blind will be discussed, such as general information regarding patient enrollment, compliance with the protocol, and external information that may affect the conduct of the study will be discussed.  Only DSMB members (both voting and ex officio non- voting), the study unblinded statistician, and the 
unblinded representatives from Berry Consultants (the adaptive design group) may attend closed sessions, unless a majority vote of the DSMB identifies other personnel whose presence is explicitly required to assist the DSMB during a closed session. All matters and information —including data presented by 
[CONTACT_314138], ethics, and scientific validity and integrity of the study may be discussed during closed sessions. All formal recommendations considered by [CONTACT_314139].  The Executive Committee will decide whether  to accept or decline the DSMB recommendation to 
continue, modify, or terminate the study. Recommendations and the rationale for recommendations will be provided in writing, to the extent necessary to support decision- making by [CONTACT_19305], 
with care not to unnecessarily unblind treatment assignments, following any formal DSMB meeting. 
 
13.5. Risks to Subjects and Adequacy of Protection Against Risks 
 Known risks of high dose intravenous vitamin C include oxalate nephropathy that can progress to renal  
failure and hemolysis in patients with G6PD -deficiency.  In an effort to fully avoid these events, patient 
with primary hyperoxaluria, previous or current oxalate nephropathy, and those with G6PD -deficiency 
will be excluded from the study.  Based on the reported potential risks of vitamin C, thiamine, and/or hydrocortisone as discussed above  
(section 3.5) , important risks were identified that could be associated with administration of one or all 
three drugs and have been labeled as “potentially associated adverse events” (PAAE).  PAAEs are listed below and will be recorded as detailed in Section 10.6 (Adverse Event Reporting):       
Nephrolithiasis  
Hemolysis  
Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Injection Site Reactions

steroids (e.g. adrenal insufficiency) will not be reported as PAAEs, but rather reviewed in aggregate at regular quarterly intervals by [CONTACT_314140], with procedures for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_314077].   Point of Care Glucometry – As discussed in section 3.5, there is a risk that some point of care glucometers 
could give falsely elevated readings when serum vitamin C concentrations are high.  Therefore, 
participating sites will be required to use only point of care devices  (Nova StatStrip) , or central or critical 
care laboratory devices that have been validated for use during high dose intravenous vitamin C.    Further, participating sites using a StatStrip device for glucose monitoring will confirm serum glucose measurements using a central or critical care laboratory device before initiating insulin therapy, and for (or up to) 24 hours after study drug  is completed (for patients who are not already on insulin 
therapy). Following initiation of insulin therapy, regular correlation of StatStrip and central or critical care 
glucose measurements will be performed daily with routine labs (this applies as well  to patients who were 
already on insulin therapy, prior to study drug initiation). Consistent with standard of care, if the clinical team or site investigator believes a StatStrip measurement is erroneous or suspects symptomatic hypoglycemia, a confirmatory serum sample should be measured by a central or critical care laboratory.  
 Subject Confidentiality – All data (case report forms, recordings, laboratory specimens, imaging, and other 
records) kept at the site will be physically and electronically secured  to maintain subject confidentiality. 
Paper records with subject data will be stored in locked office or cabinet. Computer records will always be password protected, and encrypted when possible. The study database is maintained behind a secure firewall, ac cess is password protected and it uses SSL encryption for all data entry and access.  
 
13.6. Potential Benefit of the Research to Subjects and Others  
 There is equipoise regarding whether the TP will lower mortality and affect other important outcomes among pati ents with sepsis.  Although preliminary published evidence suggests such a benefit, it is not 
guaranteed that specific benefit will be gained from participation in this study.  
 
13.7. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained 
 There are no specific medical therapi [INVESTIGATOR_314078].  The purpose of the current study is to determine (or confirm) the efficacy of the TP in the management of patients with circulatory and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_314043]. 
Therefore, the conduct of this trial may substantially expand and improve the available therapeutic options for the treatment of sepsis.  
13.8. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 The study will be monitored at regular intervals by [CONTACT_181106]/or DSMB  as specific in the DSMB 
Charter. Monitoring will be conducted in accordance with GCP guidelines. Investigators must allow 
monitors or other relevant health authorities to inspect facilities and records relevant to the study.

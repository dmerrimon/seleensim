Clinical study phase  Phase 2 
Study objectives  The objective of this study is to assess efficacy and safety of 
radium-223 dichloride in combination with exemestane and everolimus in subjects with  human epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392]  2 (HER2 ) neg ative, hormone receptor positive breast 
cancer  with bone metastases . 
The primary en dpoint  is: 
1. Symptomatic skeletal event- free survival  (SSE -FS) 
The secondary endpoints  are: 
2. Overall survival 
3. Time to opi[INVESTIGATOR_240647]  
4. Time to pain progression (only in subjects with baseline worst pain score ( WPS) ≤8) 
5. Time to cytotoxic chemotherapy  
6. Radiological progression- free survival (rPFS)  
7. Pain improvement rate  
8. Safety, acute and long term, including new primary malignancies  and hematopoietic reserve for tolerability of 
subsequent chemotherapy*  
The study will also include the following explorato ry endpoints : 
9. Time to first on -study symptomatic skeletal event  (SSE)  
10. Time to bone alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) progression  
11. Bone ALP response at Week 12 and 4 weeks  (± 7 days ) after 
last radium-223 dichloride/placebo dose 
12. Bone- specific rPFS  
13. Resource utilizat ion 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

14. Biomarker assessment s 
15. Time to visceral metastases  onset (in subjects with no 
visceral disease at baseline)  
*Safety endpoints were reported/measured as AEs. Acute safety 
was documented as the incidence of TEAEs. Long- term safety was 
documented as the incidence of post- treatment AEs. Hematopoietic 
reserve for tolerability of subsequent chemotherapy was assessed via the incidence of treatment emergent hematological toxicity and the incidence of post- treatment chemotherapy -related AEs.  
 
Note:  After impleme ntation of CSP Amendment 9,  subjects who 
completed the EOT visit could be transferred to a separate extended 
safety follow -up study for their remaining follow -up. After 
implementation of CSP Amendment 10 , all such subjects will be 
transferred; only subject s on oral treatment will remain on study, 
and no post- treatment data will be collected beyond the 30 -day 
safety follow -up (EOT visit).   
 
As the key efficacy objectives will have been accomplished, long-term safety transferred, and only a limited number of subjects will remain in this study, in order to reduce the burden to study subjects, collection of data will be reduced and will focus mainly on acute safety, SSE, and OS . Once subjects are rolled over, the long- term 
safety will be collected and assessed entirely in the separate 
extended safety follow -up study

1. Have provided written informed consent.  Subjects must be 
able to under stand and be willing to sign the written 
informed consent.  A signed informed consent form (ICF) 
must be appropriately obtained prior to the conduct of any trial- specific procedure.  
2. Documentation of histological or cytological confirmation of estrogen  receptor positive (ER+) and HER2 negative 
adenocarcinoma of the breast must be available.  Human 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2  status should be 
determined by [CONTACT_181271] /Ministry of Health  approved 
laboratory by [CONTACT_9064], fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH)  or other validated in situ hybridization (ISH) assay 
for detection of HER2 gene expression. 
3. Tumors (from either primary or metastatic sites) must be 
ER+ defined as  ≥10% positive tumor nuclei in the analyzed 
sample .  Estrogen receptor positive/ progesterone receptor 
positive ( PR+)  and ER+/  progesterone receptor negative 
(PR-) subjects are eligible whereas  estrogen receptor 
negative ( ER-)/PR+ and ER -/PR- disease will n ot be 
eligible.  
4. Women  (≥18 years of age) with metastatic  breast cancer not 
amenable to curative treatment by [CONTACT_140955].   
Women of reproductive potential and  their male partners  
must agree to use adequate contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the completion of treatme
nt with 
radium-223 dichloride /placebo . 
5. Documentation of menopausal status: postmenopausal subjects  or pre menopausal  subjects with ovarian radiation or 
concomitant therapy with a luteinizing hormone- releasing 
hormone ( LH-RH) agonist/antagonist are eligible.  
o Premenopausal  subjects with ovarian radiation or 
concomitant treatment with an LH -RH 
agonist/antagonist must have a plasma /serum  
estradiol assay  within  local laboratory 
postmenopausal range  at screening , performed  
within [ADDRESS_292196] at screening and agree to use an adequate method of 
contraception as recommended by [CONTACT_240689] 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version  7.0 Page:  8 of 153 
 
physicians.  
o Postmenopausal status is defined either by:  
 age ≥55 years and one year or more of 
amenorrhea,  
 age <55 years and one year or more of amenorrhea with a plasma /serum  estradiol assay within  local 
laboratory postmenopausal range, performed within 
7 days of randomiz ation , 
 bilateral ovariectomy. 
6. Subjects  with bone-dominant disease with at least 2 skeletal 
metastas es identified at baseline by [CONTACT_240690] ( CT)/magnetic 
resonance imaging ( MRI ). Presence of metastases in soft 
tissue ( skin, subcutaneous, muscle fat, lym ph nodes) and/or 
visceral metastases is allowed.  
7. Measurable or non -measurable disease (but radiologically 
evaluable) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors v1.[ADDRESS_292197]/MRI done as part of the standard of practice within [ADDRESS_292198] -of-care 
technet ium-99m bone scans done within 3 weeks prior to  
randomization are acceptable.
 
F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET ) scan , if performed as part of standard of 
care imaging, can b e used as an adjunct to CT/MRI in line 
with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 
guidelines. If FDG PET/CT scan, the CT component of the scan can be used for tumor measurements only if the site can document that the CT
 is of identical diagnostic quality to a 
diagnostic CT (See also Appendix 16.2). 
FDG  PET/CT or NaF PET/CT scan is acceptable as an 
alternative to technetium-99m bone scintigraphy if it is the standard of care at the instit ution, provided the same bone 
imaging modality is used throughout the study.
 
8. Subjects must have experienced recurrent/progressive 
disease following treatment with a non -steroidal aromatase 
inhibitor (letrozole or anastrozole) in an adjuvant or metastatic setting.  
9. Subjects must have received at least one line of hormonal 
therapy in the metastatic setting . 
Note: A change of the hormone agent due to progression (as 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version  7.0 Page:  9 of 153 
 
per the Investigator assessment) is counted as a new line of 
therapy.  A s witch of hormone therapy from one agent to 
another due to toxicity or other reasons (e.g., subject ’s 
preference), in absence of progressive disease at time of 
switch, will be counted as one line although [ADDRESS_292199] been administered. 
10.  Subjects  who  are eligible , as per the Investigator’s 
assessment  and according to the local label, for treatment 
with exemestane and everolimus  as a second line or greater 
of therapy  in a metastatic setting .  Subject s enrolled in the 
current study will start treatment with exemestane an d 
everolimus, after randomization, either before or simultaneously to the first injection of radium-223 
dichloride /placebo . 
11.  Subjects  must have experienced no more than 
2 skeletal -related  event s (SREs) prior to study entry defined 
as: Need for external beam radiotherapy  (EBRT ) to bone, 
pathological bone fracture (excluding major trauma), spi[INVESTIGATOR_201411]/or orthopedic surgical procedure.  Subjects  with no prior SREs are not permitted.  
Note: All prior SRE-related procedures (i.e., orthopedic 
surgery, EBRT) must be administered prior to 
randomization. Separate SRE events are the ones that occur at least 21 days apart from  each other to ensure that linked 
events (eg, surgery to repair a fracture or multiple doses of radiation during a course of treatment) are not counted as separate events. In case of bone pain that occurs in several anatomical locations and requires separate EBRT sessions for the different anatomical locations, it should be counted as one event if the EBRT  sessions are administered within a 
period of [ADDRESS_292200] 1 month before start of study treatment .

Methodology  Prior to the primary analysis, the study comprised 4 periods: 
screening, randomization, treatment, and the follow-up period (active follow -up with clinic visits and active follow -up without 
clinic visits).  
Screening period:  
All trial related procedures and evaluations will only be performed after the subject has agreed to participate and has signed the ICF.  
The screening period will consist of multiple evaluations that will take place within 3 weeks prior to randomization to ensure that al l 
eligibility criteria are met . 
Randomization:  
After all screening assessments have been completed and the subject’s eligibility has been confirmed and documented, eligible subjects will be randomized in  a ratio of 1:1 to treatment with 
radium-223 dichloride (Arm A  - investigational arm) or placebo 
(Arm B  - control arm ).  All subjects  receive open- label study 
treatment exemestane and everolimus  
and supportive care according 
to the local standard of practice.  
Treatment period:  
The total treatment period is defined from the day of randomization until [ADDRESS_292209] administration of study treatment (radium -223 dichloride/ placebo and exemestane and everolimus 
whichever occurs last).  
The study treatment consists of up to 6 cycles of radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) body weight (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) each 
separated by [CONTACT_44122] 4 weeks  ±[ADDRESS_292210] injection of radium-223 dichloride /placebo .  Subjects already receiving exemestane and 
everolimus prior to study entry are not eligible.  
After Primary Analysis (after implementation of Amendment 10):  
Following the administrative data review (per Amendment 8) conduct ed on D EC [ADDRESS_292211] .  All subjects  will receive supportive care , as per local 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version  7.0 Page:  [ADDRESS_292212] of practice.   
Assessments following primary analysis  will mainly focus on acute 
safety , SSE  and OS , as described below.  At the time Amendment 
10 is implemented, all subjects completed or discontinued radium-
223 dichloride/placebo treatment.  
During the treatment period, subjects will be assessed for safety at 
each treatment visit , every [ADDRESS_292213] practice. 
• All bone fractures and bone associated events (e.g., 
osteoporosis) need to be reported as either AE(s) or SAEs, if the criter
ia of SAE were met, regardless of the Investigator’s 
causality assessment .  
• All occurrences of any additional malignancies , including 
AML, and hematological conditions such as MDS, aplastic anemia, or myelofibrosis must be reported as SAEs, regardless of t he Investigator’s causality assessment.   
• Subjects who experience disease progression during the 
protocol defined treatment period, initiate new anti- cancer 
therapy, experience unacceptable toxicity  or discontinue the 
study treatment for other reasons , at the end of the treatment 
period, will be transferred to the separate extended safety 
follow-up study (BAY 88 -8223 study [ZIP_CODE] / 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
All ongoing subjects at the time of study termination will finish all study treatments as part of the study.  
Follow-up period:  
Following primary  analysis, active follow -up in this study will be 
discontinued. Follow-up will be conducted in the separate extended safety follow -up study (please refer to the applicable section 
below). 
Long-term follow- up in the separate extended safety  follow -up 
study:  
All subjects who have completed at a minimum the EOT  visit or 
[ADDRESS_292214], will be 
transitioned into a separate extended safety follow -up study 
(BAY  88-8223 study [ZIP_CODE] / [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The separate 
extended safety follow -up study has been set up to follow subjects 
who received radium-223 dichloride or placebo in the course of 
Bayer -sponsored clinical trials. The primary objective of this study 
is to define the long- term safety p rofile of radium -223 dichloride. 
All subjects who transition into this separate extended safety 
follow- up study will require a separate signed informed consent.  All 
efforts will be made to transition all subjects to the extended safety 
follow-up study.

discontinues oral exemestane and /or everolimus  treatment and 
completes end of treatment visit or discontinues from this study for 
another reason ( e.g., death, consent withdrawn and active objection 
for further data collection). Until the transition to the extended 
safety follow-up study, subjects will continue to follow all the 
protocols required procedures and visits in the current protocol.

Number of subject s [ADDRESS_292216] s in total (with 1:1 randomization)  
Primary variable  Symptomatic skeletal event-free survival 
Time point/frame of 
measurement for 
primary variable(s)  The primary variable/endpoint, SSE -FS, is defined as the time from 
randomization to the occurrence of one of the following: 
(1) An on-study SSE, which is defined as: 
a. the use of EBRT to relieve skeletal symptoms  
b. the occurrence of new symptomatic pathological bone 
fractures (vertebral or non -vertebral)  
c. the occurrence of spi[INVESTIGATOR_240650]  
d. a tumor related orthopedic surgical intervention. 
(2) Death from any cause  
Note:  All prior SRE -related procedures (i.e. , orthopedic surgery, 
EBRT) must be administered prior to randomization.  
Plan for statistical 
analysis The analysis of efficacy will be performed using the intent- to-treat 
population, defined as all subjects who are randomized.  
The primary efficacy analysis of SSE -FS will be performed using a 
log-rank test, stratified by [CONTACT_240693] (i.e., geog raphic region, prior lines of hormone therapy in 
metastatic setting , and visceral disease).   A one-sided alpha of 0.1 
will be used for the analysis of SSE- FS.  
Assuming a one-sided alpha of 0.1, power of 90%, the median 
SSE-FS for the control group is 8.3 months and a randomization 
ratio of 1:[ADDRESS_292217] a 50% increase in SSE- FS for a total of 
[ADDRESS_292218], stratified by [CONTACT_240694].

The analys is of safety will be descriptive only (no statistical test 
will be applied) . 
Following primary analysis, at the closure of the study , after the last 
subject  has discontinued treatment and study assessments, an 
updated analysis will be performed. The update d analysis will be 
descriptive only and may consist of listings .

04 DEC 2019  Version  7.0 Page:  [ADDRESS_292232] common cancer among women worldwide with an estimated 
1.67 million new cancer cases diagnosed in 2012 (25% of all cancers).  It is the most frequent cause of cancer death in women in less developed regions (324,000 deaths, 14.3% of total) and the second cause of cancer death in more developed regions (198,000 deaths, 15.4%) after lung cancer.( 1) 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_240651], a significant proportion of patients relapse following adjuvant treatment and approximately 5% to 6% of women present with metastatic disease at the time of their initial diagnosis.  
The clinical presentation in the metastatic setting may range from an aggressive clinical course in patients with multiple and/or extensive organ involvement, to a rather indolent clinical course in those with a solitary or only few metastatic lesions (oligometastatic disease).  
Depending on the extent of me tastatic involvement, the prognosis is variable ranging from a 
median overall survival (OS) time of 26 months in patients with bone metastases only, to 21 months in patients with bone and visceral metastases, and 18 months in patients with visceral metastases only.( 2) 
Patients with metastatic disease are unlikely to be cured with actual available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  As cure is unlikely in the metastatic setting, prolongation of survival, disease control, improvement/ mainte nance of quality of life and palliation of cancer- related symptoms are 
reasonable goals of therapy.  
Various therapeutic approaches are available; however, there are few widely accepted 
standards.  Most patients will receive systemic thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_19335], endocrine 
therapy, biologic/targeted molecular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], bone-targeted agents as well as supportive 
care.  The selection of a certain type of therapy over the other depends upon factors such as, tumor/disease characteristics (ho rmone receptor status, human epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392] 2  [HER2 ] status, extent of metastatic involvement, disease clinical behavior , etc. ), 
prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_240652], patient characteristics (i.e., comorbidities and est imated treatment tolerability, menopausal status), availability and costs 
of therapeutic agents and, last but not least, patient preference.  
Participation in well-designed clinical trials should always be considered in patients with 
metastatic breast cancer.  
Patients with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_240653]–negative tumors or with disease that is resistant to hormonal therapy are candidates for chemotherapy.  
Patients with HER2/neu positive  disease are candidates for anti -HER2 -targeted agents (i.e., 
herceptin, l apatinib).  
3.[ADDRESS_292233] cancer  
Presence of estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) is one of the most 
important prognostic/predictive factors in breast cancers.  Approximately 70% to 75% of patients with invasive breast cancer have hormone receptor (ER and/or PR) positive disease at the time of diagnosis.( 3) 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version  7.0 Page:  26 of 153 
 
Patients with hormone receptor positive disease and HER2- negative disease are candidates for 
endocrine therapy unless one of the factors described above would prompt the selection of 
another type of therapy (i.e., chemotherapy in a patient with an aggressive clinical course and rapid pace of progression).  Endocrine therapy will very likely have a beneficial effect in these patients and fewer side effects in comparison with chemotherapy. (4,5) 
Selection of the first-line endocrine agent is generally based on the menopausal status, type of endocrine agent in the adjuvant setting, timing of relapse following treatment in the adjuvant setting and tolerability.  First-line endocrine therapy is usually continued until the patient experiences disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
Additional lines of therapy may include another endocrine agent (not previously administered) or another type of t herapy such as cytotoxic therapy.  There are no widely accepted 
standards/definitive recommendations for a specific treatment sequence, number of lines of endocrine therapy, and the therapeutic decision should be again based on the factors described above. 
Endocrine therapy exerts its action either by [CONTACT_240695].  
Various endocrine agents are currently in use:  
• Selective estrogen receptor mod ulators (SERM):  Tamoxifen and t oremifene.  SERMs 
act by [CONTACT_240696].  At the same time they also mimic the action of estrogen in other tissues, such as bone and endometrium.( 6)   
• Third generation aromatase i nhibitors (AIs ) block peripheral estrogen synthesis by 
[CONTACT_240697], the enzyme responsible for the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen.( 7)  Currently available third generation aromatic inhibitor s 
(AIs) are the non- steroidal  AIs (NSAI) anastrazole and l etrozole and the steroidal AI, 
exemestane.  In the first -line setting, large phase III trials have shown that all 3, 
anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane are equivalent or superior to tamoxifen in women with metastatic disease.( 8,9,10,11) 
• Estrogen receptor down regulators:  Fulvestrant is a competitive ER  antagonist.  It 
blocks the actions of estrogens at the level of the receptor without any known partial agonist (estrogen -like) activity.  Fulvestrant has been approved by [CONTACT_24623]  
(US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
for the treatment of hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following prior anti- estrogen therapy 
based on results of published clinical studies.( 12,13 ,14) 
• Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues: Goserelin, leuprorelin, triptorelin.  
• Other: estrogens, progestins, anabolic steroids 
Recently published data from a phase I I study shows that addition of everolimus to t amoxifen 
in hormone receptor positive HER 2 negative patients who progressed on prior AI treatment 
significantly improved the clinical benefit rate, time to progression  (TTP) .(15) 
In addition to this, data from the phase III BOLERO-2 study showed that the addition of everolimus to exemestane significantly improved progression- free survival ( PFS) compared 
with single -agent exemestane in estrogen receptor positive ( ER+), HER2 -negative patients 
whose metastatic disease was refractory to prior treatme nt with letrozole or anastrozole.( 16)  
This led to the recent marketing approval of everolimus by [CONTACT_240698] 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version  7.0 Page:  27 of 153 
 
treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative advanced breast cancer, in 
combination with exemestane, in postmenopausal women without symptomatic visceral disease after recurrence or progression following a NSAI.  
At the time of final analysis  with a median follow -up of 18 months, the median PF S (as per 
Investigator r eview) was 7.8 months for everolimus and exemestane versus 3.2 months for 
placebo and exemestane ( hazard ratio [ HR] = 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38 to 
0.54; log-rank p<0.0001).( 17)  
Subgroup analyses also indicate that the effect of e verolimus in addition to exemestane was 
consistent across patient subgroups and substantially prolonged median PFS regardless of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_240654].  In pati ents with bone- only metastases at the time of study entry (21 % 
of total study population), the median PFS was 12.88 months in the everolimus plus exemestane group versus 5.29 months in patients on exemestane only  (HR = 0.33).  Patie nts 
with visceral metastases had a worse outcome, however , the improvement in median PFS was 
significant with median PFS of 6.83 months for everolimus plus exemestane group versus 
2.76 months for placebo plus exemestane group (HR = 0.47). 
3.2.[ADDRESS_292234] cancer 
Bone is a frequent site of metastatic spread with approximately 65 % to 75% of patients with 
metastatic breast cancer having skeletal involvement.( 18)  The skeleton is the first site of 
distant spread in 46% to 47% of patients with breast cancer.  The presence of skeletal metastases correlates significantly with estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity.( 19,20)  
Bone- only metastases hav e been reported to occur in 17% to 37% of women with metastatic 
breast cancer.( 21,22,23) 
Results of a recent meta-analysis from [ADDRESS_292235] cancer survival in postmenopausal women.  Reductions in bone recurrence for postmenopausal women we re 
similar independent of ER status, nodal involvement, bisphosphonate type, treatment schedule, or use of concomitant chemotherapy.( 24) 
Prognosis of patients with metastases confined to bone-only seems to be better compared to patients with visceral involvement with median survival times from the diagnosis of metastatic disease to death between 24 to 36 months as reported per different publications.( 2,22,23,25,26)  Occurrence of osseous metastases interferes with normal bone 
homeostasis and impacts the normal remodeling process by [CONTACT_240699].  This finally results in loss of bone integrity and loss of function.  
The most common sites of bone involvement are axial bones, however, other locations may 
also be encountered although with a lower frequency.  Bone lesions may be of osteolytic, osteoblastic or mixed phenotype as per the radio graphic appearance of the lesions.  It is well 
known that bone metastases from breast cancer usually show osteolytic changes.  However, interestingly, as per a retrospective study, when comparing the morphology of breast cancer bone metastases by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) in the time period 1996 to 2000 versus 2001 
to 2005, a higher prevalence of osteoblastic metastases was observed in the later period (1996 to 2000: osteolytic 53.7%, osteosclerotic 32.1%, mixed type 14.3%; 2001 to 2005: osteolytic

9.4%, osteosclerotic 71.9%, mixed type 18.7%).  This might be due to the application of 
systematic bisphosphonate treatment.( 28)   
Due to the disrupted bone remodeling process, patients with metastatic bone lesions are at risk of increas ed morbidity including skeletal- related events (SRE s) such as bone pain requiring 
intervention (i.e., radiotherapy or surgery), pathologic fractures, spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377], as well as symptomatic hypercalcemia and bone mar row infiltration.   These events will 
ultimately impair patient’s quality of lif e and functional independence. 
A multidisciplinary therapeutic approach is generally recommended in patients presenting with bone metastases.  Current therapeutic options include systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_240655], chemotherapy, and bone- targeted  agents (i.e., bisphosphonates, 
denosumab).  Local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_240656] (EBRT) as well as other supportive interventions (i.e., orthopedic interventions for prevention/correction of pathological fractures) are also an important part of the therapeutic management for symptom palliation.  
Use of systemic bone- targeted  agents such bisphosphonates as well as the newer anti- receptor 
activator of nuclear factor  Kappa-B ligand (RANKL) antibody, denosumab demonstrated a 
beneficial effect in patients with metastatic bone disease.  While bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast -mediated bone resorption, denosumab, a monoclonal antibody, inhibits key 
pathways in the vicious cycle of bone metastases by [CONTACT_240700], a mediator that stimulates increased osteoclast activity.  
Several clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of bisphosphonates in women with bone metastases from breast cancer.( 29,30,31,32) 
More recently, denosumab has been found to be more effective than zoledronic acid as measured by [CONTACT_240701]-study SREs in patients with bone metastases.( 33,34)  The median time to the first on -study SRE was 26.[ADDRESS_292236] cancer.  
A recent review of 34 trials performed in this patient population provided further confirmation that the use of bisphosphonates or denosumab (in addition to their other cancer treatments) reduces the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_240657].  However, questions on the optimal timing and duration of treatment with these agents in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer remain unanswered.( 35)  Bone- targeted a gent therapy (i.e., 
bisphosphonates and denosumab) is actually recommended for patients with breast cancer with evidence of bone metastases.( 36)  
Patients with multiple, mainly osteoblastic lesion s and pain syndrome may also benefit from 
treatment with radionuclide therapy.  Bone-seeking radionuclides have been developed for palliation of bone pain from metastases.( 37) 
Metastron (strontium-89) and Quadramet (samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate) have been approved in several countries for symptom palliation in patients with bone metastases.( 38)  The bone- seeking  nature of these agents results in direct delivery of 
beta radiation to the sites of disease.  Due to the long range of the beta particles from these radioisotopes, the major dose- limiting factor with this treatment modality is toxicity to the 
bone marrow cells, limiting the use of these agents to pain palliation only as they have not demonstrated an OS  benefit.  This toxicity has seriously limited their clinical use.

3.3 Study medications  
3.3.1 Radium-223 dichloride 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug de velopment 
Radium-223 dichloride solution for injection is a novel alpha particle emitting radiopharmaceutical.   The bone targeting property of radium- 223 is similar to that of other 
earth alkaline elements, like calcium or strontium-89.  However, the radia tion characteristics 
of an alpha particle emitting radionuclide appear to be more advantageous than of a beta- emitting radionuclide.   Radium-223, with a physical half-life of 11.4 days, emits high 
linear energy transfer  alpha radiation, with a range limite d to less than 100 micrometers.  The 
high linear energy transfer of alpha emitters (80 keV/micrometer) leads to a high frequency of double-strand deoxyribonucleic acid breaks in adjacent cells, resulting in an antitumor effect on bone metastases .  The alpha particle range from radium -223 dichloride is less than 
100 micrometers (less than 10 cell diameters) which limits damage to the surrounding normal tissue . 
Biodistribution studies have shown that radium-223 is selectively concentrated in bone compared to soft tissues, and that radium-223 is retained in the bone matrix.( 39,40)  Due to 
increased bone metabolism in skeletal metastases, prefe rential uptake in these lesions 
compared to normal bone is observed.  A significant radium-[ADDRESS_292238] has been demonstrated in an experimental skeletal metastases model in nude rats
.(40) 
The clinical development of radium-[ADDRESS_292239] could be administered safely at therapeutically relevant doses .  A total of 31 subjects  were enrolled .  Twenty -five subjects  received a single 
intravenous (IV) injection in the dose escalating part of the study, with 5 subjects  at each dose 
level of 46, 93, 163, 213 and 250 KiloBecquerel ( kBq)/kg body weight radium -223 dichloride.  
The results of this phase I study were encouraging (low toxicity, significant pain relief, and decreased serum alkaline phosphatase [ALP]); thus, a phase II trial (BC1- 02 study) for 
castration -resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC) was conducted,( 39) where subjects  received 
multiple doses of either 50 kBq/kg body weight  radium-[ADDRESS_292240] frequent adverse event ( AE) was transient diarrhea, which responded well to 
medication .  In terms of efficacy , the BC1-02 phase II results showed a significant 
improvement in serum bone markers, i.e., bone ALP (a primary efficacy endpoint), and perhaps more importantly, a delayed time to prostate specific antigen ( PSA) progression .  
Median OS at 2 years was 65.3 weeks for radium-223 dichloride and 46.3 weeks for placebo 
(HR = 2.1; p value=0.017 based on an intent- to-treat [ITT] population and adjusting for 
baseline covariates).

Following the positive results of the phase II trial, the phase III, double-blind, randomized, 
BC1-06, ALSYMPCA ( Alpharadin in Sym ptomatic Prostate Cancer) trial was started in 
2008.  A total of 922 subjects  with CRPC and symptomatic bone metastases were randomized 
to receive 6 injections of radium-223 dichloride (50 kBq/kg IV) or matching placebo every 4 
weeks .  Based on data of an interim analysis (n=809), the study was unblinded in June 2011, 
since radium-223 dichloride significantly improved OS compared to placebo (the median OS was 14.0 versus 11.2 months, respectively; HR=0.695; p=0.[ZIP_CODE]).  Symptomatic skeletal events (SSE s) were lower in the radium-[ADDRESS_292241] SSE  was 
significantly delayed (the median time to S SE was 13.6 months, versus 8.4 months, 
respectively; HR= 0.610; p=0.[ZIP_CODE]).  A low incidence of myel osuppression was observed, 
with Grade 3/4 events of neutropenia (1.8%) and thrombocytopenia (6.2%).  Adverse events 
of any grade were described in 88% of the subjects who received radium-223 dichloride, versus 94% in the placebo arm (Grade 3/4 AE s were des cribed for 51% and 59%, 
respectively) .  The updated analysis (performed in June 2012) also showed that radium-223 
dichloride significantly improved OS compared to placebo (median OS 14.9 versus  
11.3 months, respectively; p=0.[ZIP_CODE]; HR=0.695).( 41)
  
In an open- label, multicenter, single -arm, phase IIa study (BC1 -09), [ADDRESS_292242] cancer with bone-dominant disease were administered 4 injections of radium-223 dichloride (50 kBq /kg IV) every 4 weeks.  Bone markers were assessed at 
baseline, prior to every treatment, and thereafter at each follow -up visit.  The primary efficacy 
endpoints were changed in urine levels of N-terminal telopeptide (NTX) and bone ALP from baseline at Week  16.  Median urine NTX levels were reduced by 20% (from 36 to 
29 nmo1 bone collagen equivalents (BCE)/mmo1 creatinine; p=0.03) and 33%(from 36 to 
23 nmo1 BCE/mmo1 creatinine; p=0.0124) at Week 8 and Week 16, respectively; 17/23 and 9/13 subjects (for whom da ta were available) had a decrease in urine NTX at Week 8 and 
Week 16, respectively.  Median bone ALP levels were reduced by 33% (from 22.1 to 12.1 ng/mL; p=0.0001) at Week 8 and 42%  (from 22.1 to 10.94 ng/mL; p=0.04) at Week 16.  
Bone ALP levels were reduced in 20/22 subjects at Week 8 and in 10/12 subjects (for whom data were available) at Week 16.  Radium -223 dichloride was found to be safe and well-
tolerated.   Three subjects had serious AEs (SAEs), none related to study drug; 1 of them died 
due to disease progression.( 42)

information on the study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Benefits and risks 
Anticipated benefits of treatment with radium-223 dichloride include prolongation of symptomatic skeletal event- free survival (SSE -FS), OS and radiological progression- free 
survival (rPFS), delay of SSEs, palliation of bone pain, and improvement in quality of life. 
The risk profile attributed  to radium-[ADDRESS_292243] cancer.  The anticipated risks attributed to 
radium-223 dichloride include the following AEs: gastrointestinal (constipation, transient but treatable diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting); hematological (transient reduction in neutrophil 
count, mild to moderate myelosuppression, low grade thrombocytopenia).  Due to its radioactive nature, radium -[ADDRESS_292244] an increased follow-up of 7 years to asses s this potential.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Dosing rationale 
The proposed dosing regimen in this phase II trial is 50 kBq/kg body weight (55 kBq/kg after 
implementation of  National Institute of Standards and Technology [ NIST ] update) every 
4 weeks for a 6 -month treatment period (6 injections) .  In the completed phase I safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) clinical study (ATI -BC-1), subjects diagnosed with 
prostate or breast carcinoma and skeletal metastases were administered radium -223 dichloride 
in single doses of 46, 93, 163, 213, or 250 kBq/kg body weight (25 subjects ) or multiple doses 
of 5 administrations of 50 kBq/kg body weight at 3 -week intervals (3 subjects ) or 
2 administrations of 125 kBq/kg body weight at 6- week intervals (3 subjects ).  In the 
completed phase II study, 64 subjects  with CRPC and painful skeletal metastases, received 
4 injections of 50 kBq/kg body weight radium-223 dichloride (33 subjects ) or placebo 
(31 subjects) at 4 -week intervals, to examine the effects of radium -223 dichloride on 
biomarkers of disease progression, SSEs, pain palliation, survival, and safety parameters.  The 
completed phase III trial, ALSYMPCA, enrolled 922 subjects  diag nosed with CRPC and 
symptomatic bone metastases who received 6 injections of radium-223 dichloride (50 kBq/kg 
IV) in 4- week intervals .  Endpoints included OS, time to disease- related events, TTP as
measured by [CONTACT_240702], pain palliation, acute and long- term
safety profile, and health -related quality of life ( HRQoL).  The efficacy and safety data from
the ALSYMPCA trial support the selection of a dosing regimen of 6 doses of 50 kBq/kg bodyweight (55 kBq/kg after implementation o f NIST update) of radium-[ADDRESS_292245] on bone marrow suppression following multipleadministrations of radium-223 dichloride.
Currently, no data are available to assess if similar effects could be achieved with a dose 
lower than 50 kBq/kg body weight (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update). 
The same dose was used in a phase II breast cancer study BC -109 which provided preliminary 
evidence of the effects of radium -223 on bone markers, Brief Pain Index – Short Form ( BPI-
SF) score, and tumor metabolism assessed by [CONTACT_240703] F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron 
emission tomography (PET) imaging and supports further investigations to confirm 
effectiveness of radium -[ADDRESS_292246] Cancer 
Symposium 2011 and published in 2014.( 42)  The study results are presented in detail in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
3.3.[ADDRESS_292247] cancer.  Beside its use in the adjuvant setting, exemestane is also indicated in the metastatic setting for postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive disease that has progressed following tamoxifen therapy (in the US ) or following 
anti-estrogen therapy (in Europe).  In a study of exemestane versus megestrol acetate in 
postmenopausal women who experienced failure of tamoxifen, exemestane demonstrated improvement in median OS (74.6 weeks for exemestane versus  55.0 weeks for megestrol 
acetate) .(43)  
In the first -line settin g, a phase III study comparing e xemestane v ersus tamoxifen showed that 
exemestane is an effective and well -tolerated first -line hormonal treatment for 
postmenopausal women with metastatic disease and resulted in a significant early 
improvement in time to tumor progression (9.9 months [95% confidence interval or CI: 8.7 to

11.8 months ] for exemestane versus 5.8 months [95% CI: 5.3 to 8.1 months ] for 
tamoxifen). (44)  The major limitation of endocrine therapy remains however the development 
of therapeutic resistance, which will ultimately result in disease progression and eventual 
death in the majority of patients.  
The activation of the mTOR pathway is thought to be a driving factor for endocrine resistance 
in breast cancer.  The evidence of this proposed mechanism of resistance is based on the 
finding that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is constitutively activated in AI-resistant and long-
term estrogen deprived breast cancer cells.  
Everolimus, a rapamycin d erivative, is an mTOR inhibitor.  The strategy of dual inhibition by 
[CONTACT_240704] (e xemestane) with an mTOR inhibitor (e verolimus) has been 
proven to be efficacious.  Data from the p hase III BOLERO -2 study showed that the addition 
of everolimus to exemestane significantly improved PFS compared with single- agent 
exemestane in ER +, HER2 -negative patients whose metastatic disease was refractory to prior 
treatment with letrozole or anastrozole .  (See Section  3.2 for a more detailed summary of the 
efficacy results) .  
The most common Grade 3 or 4 AE s in the everolimus + exemestane group versus placebo 
plus exemestane group were as follows: stomatitis (8% v ersus  1%), anemia (6% versus <1%), 
dyspnea (4% versus  1%), hyperglycemia (4% versus <1%), fatigue (4% versus  1%),  and 
pneumonitis (3% versus 0%). The efficacy and safety results led to the recent marketing 
approval of everolimus by [CONTACT_240705]-positive, HER2/neu negative advanced breast cancer, in combination with exemestane, in postmenopausal women without symptomatic visceral disease after recurrence or progression following a n NSAI .

[CONTACT_35668] (both arms) .  Best supportive care will also be received by [CONTACT_240706].  
The mode of action of the exemestane and everolimus therapy differs from that of 
radium-223. 
The AI exemestane binds irreversibly to the active site of the enzyme aromatase, causing its 
inactivation, at the pr imary sites of estrogen synthesis which in postmenopausal women are 
peripheral tissues such as adipose tissue, muscle and breast tissue.  Everolimus is a selective 
mTOR inhibitor and acts by [CONTACT_240707] a driving factor for endocrine resistance in breast cancer.  Radium-[ADDRESS_292249] cancer .  Based upon these individual effects, it is expec ted 
that radium-223 dichloride treatment  will prolong SSE- FS compared to  placebo , when

Primary efficacy endpoints  
Symptomatic skeletal event- free survi val is defined as the time from randomization to the 
occurrence of one of the following: 
(1) An on-study SSE, which is defined as: 
a. the use of EBRT to relieve skeletal symptoms  
b. the occurrence of new symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral or 
non-vertebral)  
c. the occurrence of spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377] 
d. a tumor related orthopedic surgical intervention. 
(2) Death from any cause  
Since the definition for measuring skeletal events will not use pre -specified imaging 
assessments, the use of imaging to identif y a fracture or spi[INVESTIGATOR_240658] .  As such, only symptomatic events will be captured; asymptomatic 
radiographic events are not included in this composite endpoint.  A delay or a reduction of SSEs represents an immediate  clinical benefit, as it will delay or reduce bone pain, functional 
impairment, and the need for surgical intervention.  
In ALSYMPCA, treatment with radium-[ADDRESS_292251] SS E from 
9.8 months to 15.6 months (HR 0.658, p=0.[ZIP_CODE], data on file).  The median S SE-FS in ALSYMPCA was 9.0 and 6.4 months with and without radium-223 
dichloride, respectively (HR = 0.685, p=0.[ZIP_CODE]) .  An ad  hoc analysis (data on file) in 
subjects  who did not receive docetaxel prior to radium-223 dichloride i ndicated that the 
median duration of SSE- FS is preserved in this subgroup of 395 subjects  (SSE- FS was 
9.5 months with and 6.7 months without radium-223 dichloride). The occurrence of SREs in breast cancer patients with bone metastases is associated with 
worse functional, physical and emotional status and a decreased overall quality of life .(45,46)  
Prevention of SREs is, therefore , an important aim in the therapeutic management of these 
patients.  Bone- targeted  agents such as bisphosphonates and denosumab have been reported to 
delay the time to SRE and reduce the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_240659].  In addition, they also reduced 
bone pain and showed an improvement in quality of life .(34,35,46,47,48,49 )  As per the 
American Society of Clinical Oncology treatment guidelines , they are both recommended in 
patients with breast cancer with evidence of bone metastases .(36) 
A recent study in patients with bone metastases also reported that patients rated chronic pain as their main symptom and the mo st relevant HRQoL issue related to their disease.  This was 
followed by [CONTACT_240708] .(50) 
The high incidence of bone metastases as well as the prognostic relevance of bone involvement, definitely suggest that improvements in a bone-targeted therapeutic approach could provide further patient benefit. 
In conclusion, SSE- FS is an objective variable that is  likely to pr edict clinical benefit in the 
proposed study populations.

4. Study objectives  
The objective of this study is to assess efficacy and safety of radium-223 dichloride in 
combination with exemestane and everolimus in subjects with human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506]  2 (HER2) negative, hormone receptor positive breast cancer with bone metastases.  
The primary endpoint  is: 
• SSE-FS 
The secondary endpoints  are: 
• OS 
• Time to opi[INVESTIGATOR_240647]  
• Time to pain progression (only in subjects with baseline worst pain s core ( WPS) ≤8) 
• Time to  cytotoxic chemotherapy  
• rPFS  
• Pain improvement rate  
• Safety, acute and long term, including new primary malignancies  and hematopoietic 
reserve for tolerability of subsequent chemotherapy* 
The study will also include the following explor atory endpoints : 
• Time to first on -study SSE 
• Time to b one ALP progression 
• Bone ALP response at Week 12 and 4 weeks (±  7 days) after last radium -223 
dichloride/placebo dose 
• Bone- specific rPFS  
• Resource utilization  
• Biomarker assessments  
• Time to visceral metastases  onset (in subjects with no visceral disease at baseline) . 
*Safety endpoints were reported/measured as AEs.  Acute safety was documented as the 
incidence of TEAEs. Long -term safety was documented as the incidence of post -treatment 
AEs. Hematopoietic res erve for tolerability of subsequent chemotherapy was assessed via the 
incidence of treatment emergent hematological toxicity and the incidence of post -treatment 
chemotherapy -related AEs.  
Note: After implementation of CSP  Amendment 9 , subjects who complete d the EOT visit 
could be transferred to a separate extended safety follow -up study for their remaining follow-
up. After implementation of CSP Amendment 10 , all such subjects will be transferred; only 
subjects on oral treatment will remain on study, and no post- treatment data will be collected 
beyond the 30-day safety follow-up (EOT visit).   
As the key efficacy objectives will have been accomplished, long- term safety transferred, and 
only a limited number of subjects will remain in this study, in order to r educe the burden to 
study subjects, collection of data will be reduced and will focus mainly on acute safety, SSE,

• Geographical regions (Europe/North America [including Israel] versus Asia)  
• Previous lines of hormone therapy in metastatic setting  (1 versus 2 or more ): for the 
purpose of counting the number of prior lines of hormone therapy, only a change of 
the hormone agent due to progression is counted as a new line of therapy.  A switch of hormone therapy from one agent to another due to toxicity or other reasons (e.g., subject’s preference) in absence of progressive disease ( PD) at time of switch will be 
counted as one line although [ADDRESS_292253] been administered.

5.1.1 Study periods and duration 
Prior to the primary analysis, the study period comprise d of 4 periods: screening , 
randomization, treatment,  and the follow-up period ( active follow- up with clinic visits and  
active follow -up without clinic visits ). After the primary analysis (after implementation of 
Amendment 10), the follow-up will be conducted in the separate extended safety follow-up study, therefore, upon discontinuation of oral treatment , subjects will be directly transitioned 
to the aforementioned study. For additional details, please refer to Section  15.6. 
After Primary Analysis  (after implem entation of Amendment 10) 
Following the administrative data review (per Amendment 8 , see Section  10.5), conducted on 
DEC [ADDRESS_292254] enrollment in this trial was discontinued on APR  2018. 
Screening period:  
All trial related procedures and evaluations will only be performed after the subject has agreed to participate and has signed the informed consent form (ICF).  The screening period will consist of multiple evaluations that will take place within 3 weeks  prior to randomization to 
ensure that all eligibility criteria are met (Section  6). 
Randomization: 
After all screening assessments have been completed and the subject’s eligibility has been 
confirmed and documented, eligible subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to treatment 
with radium-223 dichloride (Arm A  - investigational arm) or plac ebo ( Arm B  - control arm).  
All subjects  will receive open- label study treatment with exemestane and everolimus and 
supportive care as per the local/institutional standard of practice.

Treatment period:  
The total treatment period is defined from the day of randomization until [ADDRESS_292255] 
administration of study treatment (radium-223 dichloride/ placebo and exemestane and 
everolimus, whichever occurs last).  
The study treatment consists of up to 6 cycles of radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg body weight (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) (Arm  A) or placebo (Arm B) each 
separated by [CONTACT_44122] 4 weeks  ±[ADDRESS_292256] injection of radium-223 dichloride /placebo .  Subjects already receiving exemestane and everolimus prior to study 
entry are not eligible.  
Treatment with exemestane and everolimus will continue after completion of radium-[ADDRESS_292257] already 
completed the radium-223 dichloride/placebo treatment.  During the treatment period, subjects will be assessed for safety at each treatment visit , every

Subjects who can no longer travel to the clinical site and subjects who miss [ADDRESS_292259] of practice.  
Study treatments (r adium-223 dichloride/placebo administration and exemestane and 
everolimus in all subject s) will continue until one of the study treatment withdrawal criteria 
(see Section  6.3.1) is met.  
Follow- up period:  
Note: Following primary analysis, the follow -up will be conducted in the separate extended 
safety follow -up study (please refer to the section below) ; therefore, upon discontinuation of 
oral tre atment, subjects will be directly transitioned to the aforementioned study. For 
additional details, please refer to Section  15.6. 
Long-term follow- up – Extended safety follow- up study  
All study subj ects who have completed at a minimum the EOT  visit or [ADDRESS_292260], will be transitioned into a separate extended safety  follow-
up study (BAY 88-8223 study [ZIP_CODE] / [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  The separate extended safety f ollow-

the course of Bayer -sponsored clinical trials. T he primary objective of this study is to define 
the long- term safety profile of radium-223 dichloride.  All subjects who transition into this 
separate extended safety follow- up study will require a separate signed informed consent.   All 
efforts will be made to transition all subjects to the extended safety follow -up study.  
After primary analysis, sites/subjects not transitioning to extended safety follow-up protocol 
will be encouraged to report all occurrences of leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic 
anemia, new primary malignancies, bone fractures, and bone associated events via Bayer Pharmacovigilance as individual case safety report (ICSR), including the corresponding study 
number and subject  ID. 
This study will end by [CONTACT_240709] / or 
everolimus treatment and completes end of treatment visit or discontinues from this study for another reason ( e.g., death, consent withdrawn and active objection for further data collection, 
lost to follow -up). Until the transition to the extended safety  follow-up study, subjects will 
continue to follow all the protocols required procedures and visits in the current protocol.

could be transferred to a separate extended  safety follow -up study for their remaining follow-
up. After implementation of CSP Amendment 10 , all such subjects will be transferred; only 
subjects on oral treatment will remain on study, and no post- treatment  data will be collected 
beyond the 30-day safety follow-up (EOT visit).   
As the key efficacy objectives will have been accomplished, long- term safety transferred, and 
only a limited number of subjects will remain in this study, in order to reduce the burden to 
study subjects, collection of data will be reduced and will focus mainly on acute safety, SSE, 
and OS.  Once subjects  are rolled over, the long- term safety will be collected and assessed 
entirely in the separate extended safety follow -up study.

up study (BAY 88-8223 study [ZIP_CODE] / [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The separate extended safety follow-
up study has been set up to follow subjects who received radium-223 dichloride or placebo in 
the course of Bayer -sponsored clinical trials. T he primary objective of this study is to define 
the long- term safety profile of radium-223 dichloride. All subjects who transition into this 
separate extended safety follow- up study will require a separate signed informed consent.  All 
efforts will be made to transition all subjects to the extended safety follow -up study.  
After primary analysis, sites/subjects not transitioning to extended safety follow-up study will 
be encouraged to report all occurrences of leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, new primary malignancies, bone fractures, and bone associated events via Bayer Pharmacovigilance as individual case safety report (ICSR), including the corresponding st udy 
number and subject  ID. 
This study will end by [CONTACT_240710]

6.3 Withdrawal of subjects from study 
6.3.1 Withdrawal 
Until the primary analysis, the study comprised the following 4 periods:  
1. Screening  
2. Randomization 
3. Treatment period   
4. Active follow -up period with or without clinic visits  
Note:  Study drug discontinuation (i.e., discontinuation during the treatment period) does not 
constitute withdrawal from the study.  Every effort should be made to retain subjects who 
discontinue the treatment period for any reason. 
Subjects are expected to participate in the follow -up unless they explicitly object.  Withdrawal 
of consent should be documented in the subject’s medical file.  If subject s do not wish to be 
followed up further, they should sign the “ Declaration of Objection to Collection of Study 
Data after Withdrawal of Consent” form.   
A “dropout” is defined as a subject who has been randomized and discontinues study 
participation prematurely  for any reason.  
A “screening failure” is defined as a subject who has signed informed consent and terminates the study for any reason (e.g., failure to satisfy the selection criteria) before randomization.  
Any subject removed from the study will remain under medical supervision until discharge or 
transfer is medically acceptable.  
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF  and in the subject’s 
medical records (consent withdrawal [due to AE or for other reason], lost to follow-up, or death).  
When a subject i s withdrawn from the study, i.e., is not attending follow-up visits, the EOS  
page in the eCRF is to be completed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal from treatment period (collection of follow-up data)  
The total treatment period is defined from the day of randomization until [ADDRESS_292279] 
administration of study treatment (radium-223 dichloride/placebo and exemestane and everolimus, whichever occurs last).  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from the radium-223 dichloride/placebo treatment  for the 
following reasons: 
• If, in the Investigator 's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation of the radium-223 dichloride/placebo 
treatment would be harmful to the subject's well- being.  
• If the subject experiences unacceptable toxicities to radium-223 dichloride/placebo. 
• If a subject experiences  National Cancer In stitute (NCI) -Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ) Grade 3  to 4 anemia, neutropenia, or 
thrombocytopenia lasting >2 weeks despi[INVESTIGATOR_240662].

• Delay in radium-223 dichloride/placebo administration of > 4 weeks  (maximum of 
8 weeks between 2 injections of radium-223 dichloride/ placebo ). 
• If the subject starts trea tment with a prohibited m etastatic breast cancer therapy  
(Section  8.1).  
• If exemestane and everolimus or further standard of care hormonal anti- cancer therapy 
are discontinued, radium-223 dichloride/placebo must also be discontinued. 
• After primary analysis, if the subject can no longer travel to the clinical site , she will 
be discontinued from all study treatments and will be transitioned to the separate 
extended safety follow -up study ([ZIP_CODE]).  Subjects who miss 2 consec utive treatment 
visits will be considered unable to travel to the site, will be discontinued from all study 
treatments and will be transitioned to the separate extended safety follow -up study 
([ZIP_CODE]). 
• At her  own request or at the request of her legally acceptable represen tative.  
• At the specific request of the s ponsor and in liaison with the Investigator (e.g., obvious 
non-compliance, safety concerns).  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from the exemestane and everolimus treatment for the following 
reasons:  
• If, in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation of exemestane and/or everolimus 
treatment would be harmful to the subject's well- being.  
• If the subject experiences  disease progression  or initiates  a new anti -cancer therapy.  
Disease progression being defined as radiological progression (either by [CONTACT_240712]), or clinical progression .  
• If the subject experiences unacceptable toxicities to exemestane and/or everolimus (as 
per Section  7.4.6 Dose adjustments, delays, and treatment discontinuations). 
• Delay in exemestane and everolimus administration of >4 weeks. 
• If the subject starts treatment with a prohibited metastatic breast cancer therapy (Section  8.1).  
• If the subject can no longer travel to the clinical site.  After primary analysis, s he will 
be discontinued from all study treatments and will be transitioned to the separate 
extended safety follow -up study ([ZIP_CODE]).  Subjects who miss ed 2 consecutive 
treatment visits will be considered unable to travel to the site, will be discontinued 
from all study treatments and will be transitioned to the separate extended safety 
follow-up study ([ZIP_CODE]) 
• At her own request or at the request of her legally acceptable representative.  
• At the specific request of the sponsor and in liaison with the Investigator (e.g., obvious non-compliance, safety concerns).  
Subjects who experience disease progression  (bone or non-bone) will discontinue exemestane 
and everolimus. 
Note:   Study treatment discontinuation (i.e., withdrawal from treatment period) does not 
constitute withdrawal from the study.  Following primary analysis, the follow -up will be 
conducted in the separate extended safety follow -up study; therefore, upon discontinuation of

additional details, please refer to Section  15.6. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal from treatment period and/or all follow-up (no further 
data collection) 
Subjects must  be withdrawn from the study treatment and/or procedures and no further data 
will be collected for the following reasons: 
• Subject withdraws consent from study treatment and/or study procedures.  A subject 
must b e removed from the study at her  own request or at the request of her  legally 
acceptable representative.   At any time during the study and without giving reasons, a 
subject may decline to participate further the subject’s rights will be protected.  
• Subject i s lost to follow -up 
• Death  
Note:   Withdrawal of consent should be documented in the subject’s medical file.  If the 
subject does not wish to be followed up further, they  should sign the “ Declar ation of 
Objection to Collection of Study Data after Withdrawal of Consent” form.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_292280] number (a unique identification number) will be assigned via an Interactive 
Voice/Web Response System (IXRS) when a subject signs the ICF and is evalua ted for 
inclusion into the study.  When the subject is eligible for the trial, the study site  will send an

[IP_ADDRESS]  Bone-targeted agents, bisphosphonates and denosumab 
Bisphosphonates (diphosphonates) are a class of drugs that prevent the loss of bone mass, 
used to treat osteoporosis and similar diseases including bone metastases.  Whichever 
bisphosphonate is selected for use as therapy should be stored and administered according to the local label.  
Denosumab (Xgeva
®), a RANKL inhibitor, is indicated for the prevention of SREs in subject s 
with bone metastases from solid tumors.  It is supplied as a single -use vial as a suspension of 
120 mg/1.7 mL and should be stored in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) in the original carton.  Xgeva must not be exposed to temperatures above 25°C/77°F or direct li ght 
and must be used within [ADDRESS_292290]  according to the local label.  
7.3 Treatment assignment 
To accomplish  random assignment of radium-223 dichloride/placebo treatment, a 
computer-generated randomization list will be prepared by [CONTACT_240713].   The IXRS will assign each eligible subject a randomization number and the respective 
treatment  in a ratio of 1:1 to radium-223 dichloride/ placebo.   In addition, randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_240714] (Europe/North America [including Israel] versu s Asia ), 
previous lines of hormone therapy in metastatic setting (1 versus 2 or more), and visceral disease yes v ersus no.
  
The IXRS will provide only the randomization number to the caller, i.e., blinded personnel, but not the assigned treatment.  A confirmation e- mail containing the randomization number 
will be sent to the unblinded personnel who  will have to log into IXRS  in order to know the 
treatment arm assigned to the patient.  The unblinded personnel will be responsible for 
preparing the study drug for the subject for the first administration.   For US  only, if a subject 
is allocated to radium-[ADDRESS_292291] is allocated to placebo, the unblinded person at the study site will be responsible for providing saline corresponding to the IX RS treatment day.   
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

the product can be administered on an out- patient basis.   To minimize the risk of 
contamination, the subject and her  caregivers will receive oral and  written instructions 
regarding hygiene precautions to abide by [CONTACT_240715].  These instructions will be given to 
all subjects, as neither the Principal In vestigator nor subject will know the assignment to 
radium-223 dichloride/placebo injections. 
7.4.1 Dose calibration 
Radium-223 dichloride can be measured in a normal dose calibrator instrument.  When all the required written approvals for the use and handling of radium-223 dichloride from the Radiation Protection Agency/Agencies for the specific site  have been received by [CONTACT_456], 
a vial of radium-223 dichloride for technical use will be sent to the study site .  
Different clinical study site s possess dose cal ibrators from various suppliers; thus, the isotope 
calibration factor may differ from site  to site .  Consequently, each site  must perform the 
radium-223 dial setting on their relevant dose calibrator(s) if no isotope calibration factor for radium-223 is being provided by [CONTACT_240716].  For dial setting, the clinical study site  will receive a sealed vial or a pre- filled  syringe containing a radium-223 
solution for calibration only.  The vial or syringe is identical to the vials/syringes  used for 
study treatment.   The amount of radium-223 in the vial /syringe  will be stated on the label.   
Instructions for the dial setting, including the calibration log form, will be enclosed with the dispatch of the calibration sample. 
As of Amendment 3, NIST has established an updated standardization for radium-223 
dichloride, which indicates that an approximately 10% difference existed between activity values obtained using the current standard and the updated standardization.  The current NIST standard for radium -223 dichloride (NIST 2010 [ 52]) will remain in effect for this protocol 
until all Health Authorities for which Bayer holds a marketing application for radium-[ADDRESS_292293] approved the regulatory variations for Xofigo

standardization for radium-223 dichloride (NIST update [ 53]), which should be documented 
on the appropriate study forms.  This step will be performed so that all sites will have the new dial setting (NIST update  [53]) in place at the time of implementation.  The current dial

primary dedicated unblinded person (“the unblinded person”), who has the responsibility delegated from the Principal Investigator, will be responsible for the safe handling and storage of radium-[ADDRESS_292297] be stored inside their lead container in a secure 
facility.   The study drug should be used within 28 days of production or prior to the expi[INVESTIGATOR_240666] .  
Control measurements of both the radium-223 dichloride vial (before and after dispensing) and syringes (before and after administration) are performed as part of the clinical trial documentation.  Since PRDs will be prepared at the country depot, relevant procedures are recorded by [CONTACT_240717].  All administrations of radium-223 dichloride will be 
based on the certified activity of radium- 223 at the reference date.   Please note that all 
documentation that contains unblinded information should be kept by [CONTACT_240718](s) and not shared with the other study site  personnel during the conduct of the study. 
7.4.3 Radium-223 dose calculation 
The dosage of radium-223 dichloride is 50 kBq/kg body weight (55 kBq/kg after implementatio n of NIST update).  The total activity to be injected will be calculated 
volumetrically using the subject’s body weight within 5 days of injection (kg), the 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) dosage level, and the decay correction factor (DK) to correct for physical decay of radium -223.  A table with DKs according to 
physical decay of the study medication will be provided with each vial of radium-223 
dichloride.  The total amount (volume to be drawn into the syringe) to be administered to a subject should be calculated according to the recommended formula below: 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version  7.0 Page:  52 of 153 
 
Body weight (kg) x 50 kBq/kga = volume to be injected (mL) 
   DK x 1000 kBq/mLb 
a 55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update  
b 1100 kBq/mL after implementation of NIST upda te  
Site specific volume calculation methods are acceptable as well , provided that the subject  
dose is 50kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update). 
Data regarding activity, calculations, and volume to be injected must be recorded in the IMP 
preparation log and in the study electronic data capture tool (Medidata Rave; [RAVE ]) by [CONTACT_240719].  This applies to both doses that are prepared at the study site and doses that 
are prepared by [CONTACT_106623] -site vendor.  
For subjects in Arm B (placebo injection), the volume of saline to be injected will be provided 
by [CONTACT_240720]’s weight.  Data regarding the saline batch number and the volume to be injected should be recorded in RAVE. 
7.4.4 Study drug  dose preparation  
To keep the treating physician blinded to the assignment of study medication, the unblinded 
person (e.g., from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240667]) will be responsible for blinding the syringe, and responsible for calculating the required dosage.  Data regardi ng 
activity and volume to be injected should be recorded in the IMP preparation log and in the appropriate eCRF, both of which will not be available to the treating physician.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_240668].  Additional written instructions for study drug administration, for blinded and unblinded personnel, will be provided. 
Personnel should use appropriate protective clothing and equipment during syringe filling and 
application to prevent contamination with the radioactive solution (lab coats, medical gloves / 
protective glasses) and to reduce radiation exposure.   Sites should adhere to all relevant 
radiation safety regulations as prescribed by [CONTACT_240721], including as low as reasonably achievable principles.  
Filling of the syringe should take place in a safety bench or similar cabinet in the Radiopharmacy/ Nuclear Medicine department.   The individual responsible for study drug 
preparation will draw the correct volume of study drug into a syringe.  The size of the syringe should be chosen according to the applied volume to reach the required dosing accuracy.  In 
some countries/study site s a [ADDRESS_292298] will be assigned 1 syringe label set, with a unique serial 
number.  The serial number will link the vial/batch  received with the preparation and blinded 
administration of the syringe.  
For subjects in the placebo arm, a syringe with isotonic saline will be prepared in the same way as for the active treatment, including the use of unique serial numbers on the syringe.  
The study medication will be administered as a slow bolus IV injection.   The actual 
radioactivity administered must be within the tolerance limits of ± 10% of the calculated 
radioactivity.  After administration, the equipment used in connection with the preparation

7.5 Blinding  
Every effort will be made to keep the study blinded.  Subjects will be randomized t o receive 
radium-223 dichloride/placebo in a double- blind fashion.  All subjects will also receive 
exemestane and everolimus.  This treatment  will be provided by [CONTACT_240722]- label format.  
Due to the nature of radium-[ADDRESS_292310] 2 persons in the study site’s nuclear medicine department who are unblinded to the treatment arms assigned  to subjects.  
One of these unblinded individuals will serve as back-up for the other.  To  maintain the study 
blind for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240670], the unblinded person at the study site will be responsible for filling the syringe with the correct amount of radium-223 
dichloride/placebo (saline) and labeling it.  Both radium-[ADDRESS_292311] received radium-223 dichloride/ placebo.  All treating physicians, clinical staff, subjects , and sponsor personnel w ill 
be blinded as to the treatment to which a subject is randomized, except for named representatives who will perform the verification of the drug accountability at the study sites and drug ordering.  
Treatment with exemestane and everolimus is not blinde d. 
Unblinding:  
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the subject’s treatment code will usually b e 
unblinded before reporting to the H ealth Authorities, ethic committees if the S[LOCATION_003]R was 
related to the blinded treatment.  Investigators may only unblind subjects  under emergency

• It is the site responsibility to ensure that the study treatment with exemestane and 
everolimus is administered in line with standard practice and local label instructions.  
Same applies for bisphosphonates and denosumab. 
8.1.2 Permitted concomitant therapy 
The following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_240672] : 
• Standard -of-care anti -cancer hormonal treatment: if exemestane and everolimus is no 
longer considered a treatment option and the subject must start another standard-of-care hormonal treatment, the subject can continue radium-223 dichloride/placebo until completion . 
• Conventional multivitamins, selenium, and soy supplements 
• All subjects are expected to  have be en on therapy with e ither denosumab or 
bisphosphonates for at least 1 month before the start of study treatment  and to continue 
on this therapy during the course of the study, with no change to therapy expected during the study , except for toxicity reasons . 
• During treatment with denosumab or bisphosphonates, the subjects should be 
administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU vitamin D daily.  
• In premenopausal women with ovarian suppression, treatment with LH-RH agonists or antagonists must start at least 4 week s prior to enrol lment (signature [CONTACT_62686]) and continue during the treatment period.  Non-hormonal methods of contraception should be employed during therapy until menses resume. 
• Subjects of reproductive potential who are sexually active must ag ree to utilize, during 
the treatment period and for [ADDRESS_292318] dose of radium-223 dichloride/ placebo , 
2 reliable and acceptable methods of contraception used simultaneously: a barrier method such as a) condoms (male or female) with spermicidal agent or b) diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, combined with a highly effective non-hormonal birth control method such as intra -uterine device ( IUD). 
• Blood transfusions and treatment with erythropoietin  stimulating agents  are allowed 
after randomization ( if required to ensure that the treatment range for Hb is met at 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

Day 1 of each cycle) but not within 4 weeks prior randomization.  Platelet transfusions 
are allowed after randomization but not within 4 weeks of randomization. 
• Use of biologic response modifiers, such as G- CSF or GM -CSF, is allowed in the 
management of acute toxicity such as febrile neutropenia when clinically indicated or 
at the discretion of the Investigator .  These drugs are not allowed within 4 weeks prior 
to randomization. 
• Analgesic use will be captured via a subjec t diary  and the eCRF (analgesic 
consumption diary and recorded analgesics, respectively, see schedule of assessments , 
Table 9–1).  Subjects will be asked to track thei r analgesic use in an analgesic 
consumption diary for 24 hours prior to their clinic visit.  Any medication taken for 
pain, whether for palliation of bone pain or relief of other type of pain, and any changes should be recorded in the eCRF at each visit .  Note that EBRT  treatment 
should be recorded in the eCRFs until end of the active follow-up period without clinic visits.  
• Treatment with exemestane and everolimus :  subject s enrolled in the current study, 
will start treatment with exemestane and everolimus,  after randomization, either before 
or simultaneously to the first injection of radium-223 dichloride /placebo .
 Subject s who 
received prior treatment or are already receiving everolimus prior to study entry are 
not eligible.  Administration of exemestane an d everolimus will be in accordance to 
the local standard of practice and local label.  
8.[ADDRESS_292319]-study treatment therapy 
Treatment with radium-223 dichloride/ placebo will be halted following completion of the full 
assigned treatment or at early termination.  Treatment with exemestane and everolimus will be 
terminated for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or other reasons ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Following discontinuation of all study treatments ( radium-223 dichloride/placebo treatment, 
exemestane and everolimus) , subjects will be treated and followed as per the institutional 
standard -of-care and/or according to the physician’s clinical judgment.   
If possible cytotoxic chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotope, hemibody external radiotherapy or other investigational drug should not be given before a 4- week wash out period 
after last administration of radium-223 dichloride/placebo, provided the subject’s bone marrow is not compromised. 
Details of post- study anti -cancer treatment will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.

Important Note: If rescreening  is indicated, it must be completed with approval from the 
medical monitor of the sponsor.  No more than one re screening  attempt will be allowed for 
each subject .  Please refer to Section  6.[ADDRESS_292338] eligibility.  Randomization may coincide with the end of a screening visit if all evaluations are complete; otherwise, randomization may be performed in a separate clinic visit.  
• IXRS must be called for drug re-supply in preparation for the next study visit.  This should be done on the day of randomization (where possible) to provide the maximum time in advance of the next scheduled subject visit date and in accordance with country- specific order lead -times.  
9.2.3 Treatment peri od 
The treatment period is defined from the day of randomization until 4 weeks (±7 days) after the last administration of study treatment (radium-223 dichloride/placebo and exemestane and everolimus whichever occurs last).  
The time between randomization an d first injection of radium-223 dichloride/placebo should 
be as brief as possible in accordance with the country -specific drug order lead time.  
During the treatment period, the subject will visit the study site at regular intervals.  Radium-223 dichloride /placebo will be injected at 4 -week intervals for 6 cycles on an out-
patient basis ( Section  9.1).  The minimum time window between 2 injections of radium-223 
dichloride/placebo must be [ADDRESS_292339] injection of radium-223 dichloride/placebo.  Subjects who received prior treatment or are already receiving everolimus prior to study entry are not eligible.  Administration of exemestane and everolimus will be in accordance to the local standard of practice and local  label. Starting dose, dose modifications, 
and administration of exemestane and everolimus must be in compliance with the local labels in each of the participating countries and/or in line with local standard of practice. 
Treatment with exemestane and ever olimus will continue after completion of radium-223 
dichloride/placebo until disease progression, initiation of new anti- cancer therapy, 
unacceptable toxicity occurs, discontinuation of study treatment for other reasons, or study is 
terminated, whichever o ccurs first.   
All ongoing subjects at the time of study termination will finish all study treatments as part of the study. 
It is the responsibility of the unblinded person to calculate the required volume of study drug 
(i.e., dose of radium- 223 dichloride/ placebo) for the subject based on the subject’s body 
weight within 5 days of administration  and the reference date of the received study medication 
(Section  7.4.3).

04 DEC 2019  Version 7.0 Page:  [ADDRESS_292340]’s weight measurement, order confirmation call to the IXRS, and prescription for the central PRD depot are to be performed 5 days prior to injection.  All efforts should be made to measure weight at the same visit with the pre -dose 
laboratory assessments to avoid 2 pre- dose clinic visits.  
Before administration of radium-223 dichloride/placebo, the subject must be well hydrated; thus, the subject should be instructed to drink ad libitum . 
Hematology parameters requirements prior to study drug administration  
The blood samples for clinical chemistry and hematology should be taken within [ADDRESS_292341] radium -223 dichloride/placebo administration  
Before the first administration of radium-223 dichloride/placebo (within 3 days), the ANC 
should be ≥1.5 x 10
9/L, the platelet count ≥100 x 109/L and Hb ≥ 8g/dL. 
Blood transfusions and treatment with erythropoietin stimulating agents are allowed after randomization but not within 4weeks prior randomization.  Platelet transfusions are allowed after 
randomization but not within 4 weeks prior to randomization.  
Subsequent radium -223 dichloride/placebo between study drug administrations  
The following hematological parameters value should be met prior to each subsequent radium-223 dichloride/placebo administration: Hb level ≥8.0 g/dL, ANC ≥1.0 x 10
9/L, and the 
platelet count ≥75 x 109/L. 
If Hb levels are below 8 g/dL, the Hb needs to recover to 8.0 g/dL or higher before next study drug administration.   
If ANC is lower than 1.0 x 10
9/L or platelet count is lower than 75 x 109/L, radium -223 
dichloride/placebo injection should be delayed until recovery to ANC ≥1.0 x 109/L and platelet 
count ≥75 x 109/L.   
If there is more than a 4 -week delay in the next injection (i.e., more than 8 weeks between 
injections), the study drug should be permanently discontinued and the subject should enter the active follow -up period without clinic visits.  Treatment of low Hb is acceptable between study 
drug administrations.  
Treatment with exemestane and everolimus  
Dose modifications for the treatment with exemestane and everolimus are summarized in Section  7.4.6.  Please refer to the local full prescribing information for further guidanc e.

9.2.4 Active follow-up 
Following primary analysis, the follow -up will be conducted in the separate extended safety 
follow-up study. Therefore, active follow -up is no longer applicable to this study (see 
Section  5.1.1 for further details). 
9.2.[ADDRESS_292349], will be transitioned into an  extended safety  
follow-up study (BAY 88-8223 study [ZIP_CODE] / [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The separate extended safety follow-up study has been set up to follow subjects who received radium-223 dichloride or 
placebo in the course of Bayer-sponsored clinical trials. T he primary objective of this study is 
to define the long- term safety profile of radium -223 dichloride. All subjects who transition 
into this separate long- term follow -up study will require a separate signed informed consent. 
All efforts will be made to transition all subjects to the extended safety follow -up study. 
After primary analysis, sites/subjects not transitioning to extended safety follow-up study will 
be encouraged to report all occurrences of leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, new primary malignancies, bone fractures, and bone associated events via Bayer

Pharmacovigilance as indiv idual case safety report (ICSR), including the corresponding study 
number and subject  ID. 
This study will end at the time the last subject  on treatment discontinues oral exemestane and 
/or everolimus treatment and completes end of treatment visit or discontinue s from this study 
for another reason (e.g., death, consent withdrawn and active objection for further data 
collection, lost to follow -up). Until the transition to the extended safety  follow-up study, 
subjects will continue to follow all the protocols required procedures and visits in the current 
protocol. 
9.2.6 Radiological assessment: tumor and response evaluation 
Radiological scans for tumor evaluation must be performed at the following time points : 
• Within 3 weeks prior to randomization: technetium -99m bone scan and CT or MRI 
(chest/abdomen/pelvis and any additional sites of disease, as applicable)  
After primary analysis:  
• CT or MRI (chest/abdomen/pelvis and any additional sites of disease, as applicable) : 
according to local standard practice.  
• Technetium -99m (bone scan) : according to local standard practice.  
Disease response assessment, using the modified RECIST 1.1 (mRECIST 1.1) guidelines (See also Appendix 16.2), is to be performed at each time po int when CT/MRI scans are done.
 
This schedule is to be maintained and will not be shifted because of treatment interruptions/delays.  
Standard -of-care CT/MRI done within [ADDRESS_292350] -of-care bone 
scans done within 3 weeks of random ization are acceptable provided  they are in line with 
protocol requirements criteria (anatomic coverage chest/abdomen/pelvis and in line with 
RECIST  1.1/mRECIST 1.1 guidelines for image acquisition).  All suspected sites of disease 
should be imaged. 
After primary analysis, imaging scans will continue until disease progression or treatment 
discontinuation according to local standard practice. Note: FDG PET  scan , if performed as part of standard-of-care imaging, can be used as an 
adjunct to CT/MRI in line with RECIST 1.1 guidelines. If FDG PET/CT scan, the CT 
component of the scan can be used for tumor measurements only if the site can document that the CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT. (See also Appendix 16.2 ).
 
A technetium -99m bone scan with careful identification of all disease -related hotspots should 
be performed for all patients at the above mentioned time points. All visible bone lesions must also be imaged with conventional anatomical imaging procedures such as CT or MRI scan (at time points  when CT/MRI scans are done).  
Note: FDG PET/CT or NaF PET/CT scan is acceptable as an alternative to technetium-99m 
bone scintigraphy if it is the standard-of-care at the institution, provided the same bone imaging modality is used throughout the study.
 
The same lesions identified at baseline must be evaluated at follow -up assessments using the 
same technique and preferably by [CONTACT_49238]/radiologist.

9.4 Efficacy 
9.4.1 Efficacy variables 
The primary efficacy variable  is: 
• SSE- FS 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version 7.0 Page:  77 of 153 
 
The secondary efficacy variables are:  
• OS 
• Time to opi[INVESTIGATOR_240647]  
• Time to pain progression (only in subjects with baseline WPS ≤8) 
• Time to cytotoxic chemotherapy  
• rPFS  
• Pain improvement rate  
The study will also include the following exploratory efficacy endpoints : 
• Time to first on -study SSE 
• Time to b one ALP progression 
• Bone ALP response at Week 12 and 4 weeks (±  7 days ) after last radium-223 
dichloride/placebo dose 
• Bone- specific rPFS  
• Time to visceral metastases  onset (in subjects with no visceral disease at baseline)  
Note:  After implementation of CSP  Amendment 9 , subjects who completed the EOT visit 
could be transferred to a separate extended safety follow -up study for their remaining follow-
up. After implementation of CSP Amendment 10 , all such subjects will be transferred; only 
subjects on oral treatment will remain on study, and no post- treatment data will be collected 
beyond the 30-day safety follow-up (EOT visit).   
As the key efficac y objectives will have been accomplished, long- term safety transferred, and 
only a limited number of subjects will remain in this study, in order to reduce the burden to 
study subjects, collection of data will be reduced and will focus mainly on acute safety, SSE, 
and OS. Once subjects are rolled over, the long- term safety will be collected and assessed 
entirely in the separate extended safety follow -up study.  
9.4.2 Definition of efficacy variables 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary endpoint  
Symptomatic skeletal event -free survival  is def ined as the time from randomization to the  
occurrence of one of the following: 
(1) An on-study SSE, which is defined as: 
a. the use of EBRT to relieve skeletal symptoms  
b. the occurrence of new symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral or non-
vertebral)  
c. the occurrence of spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377] 
d. a tumor related orthopedic surgical intervention. 
(2) Death from any cause  
Note:  All prior SRE -related procedures (i.e. , orthopedic surgery, EBRT) must be 
administered prior to randomization .

04 DEC 2019  Version 7.0 Page:  78 of 153 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary efficacy endpoints  
Overall survival is defined as the time (days) from the date of randomization to the date of 
death due to any cause.  For subjects who are still alive, their OS will be censored at the last known alive date or the database cutoff date, whichever occurs first.  
Time to opi[INVESTIGATOR_240675].  Subjects who have no opi[INVESTIGATOR_240676].  Subjects with no on- study assessment or 
no baseline assessment will be censored at the date of randomization. 
Time to opi[INVESTIGATOR_240677]/or the 
eCRF (analgesic consumption diary and recorded analges ics, respectively, see schedule of 
assessments) .  
Time to pain progression will be evaluated in subjects with baseline WPS ≤ 8.   Time to pain progression is defined as the interval from randomization to the first date 
a subject experiences pain progression based on WPS.  Pain progression is defined as an 
increase of 2 or more points “worst pain in 24 hours” score from baseline observed at 2 
consecutive evaluations ≥4 weeks apart   
OR 
an increase in pain management  (IPM) with respect to baseline, whichever occurs first.  
Assessments will occur on the day of the visit .  An evaluable pain assessment interval requires 
completion of a minimum of [ADDRESS_292351] not progressed.  Subjects with no on- study assessment or 
no baseline assessment will be censored at the date of randomization.   
Pain improvement  is defined for subjects evaluable for pain improvement, i.e., subjects with 
baseline WPS ≥2, as a 2-point decrease or more in WPS from baseline over [ADDRESS_292352] 4 weeks apart , without an IPM. 
Pain improvement rate  is defined as the number of subjects with pain improvement as 
defined above, divided by [CONTACT_240735] (i.e., 
subjects with baseline WPS ≥2).  Pain improvement rate at week 12, EOT, and any  visit will 
be considered.
 
The BPI -SF (Appendix 16.7 is a short, self-administered questionnaire with 11 items, which 
was designed to evaluate the intensity of, and the impairment caused by [CONTACT_77368] .  All BPI -SF 
items are scored using rating scales .  Four items measure  pain intensity (pain now, average 
pain, worst pain, and least pain) using 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“pain as bad as you can imagine”) numeric rating scales, and 7 items measure the level of interference with function caused by 
[CONTACT_77368] (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life) using 0 (does not interfere ) to 10 (complete ly interfere s) rating scales.  
The items are aggregated into 2 dimensions, (1) Pain severity index, using the mean of the 
4 items on the pain intensity, and (2) Function interference index, using the mean of the [ADDRESS_292353] be completed for aggregating the pain severity 
index.  The function interference index is scored as the mean of the it em scores multiplied by 
7, given that more than 50% or [ADDRESS_292354] been completed.

Time to cytotoxic chemotherapy is defined as the time (days) from the date of 
randomization to the date of the first cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
Radiological progr ession -free survival (rPFS ) is defined as the time (days) from the date of 
randomization to the date of confirmed radiological progression in either soft tissue, viscera or 
bone, or death (if death occurs before progression).  Subjects without confirmed radiological progression or death at the time of analysis will be censored at their last date of radiological tumor assessment (See Statistical Analysis Plan [SAP] for detailed censoring rules) .  Bone 
scans and CT/MRIs will be read locally .  All bone lesions visible on a technetium-99m bone 
scan will need to also be imaged using conventional anatomical imaging techniques such as SPECT CT/MRI or CT/MRI  (with or without contrast).  Bone progression will be declared 
according to the modified RECIST 1.1 criteria (see Appendix 16.2).  If a new bone lesion or 
unequivocal increase in size of bone lesions is identified on bone scan, the lesion must also be confirmed by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI.  If a new bone lesion or unequivocal increase in size of bone lesions is only visible on a CT/MRI and not visible on a technetium-99m bone scan, progression will be declared without further confirmation. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Exploratory efficacy endpoints: 
Time to first on -study SSE is defined  as the time (days) from the date of randomization to 
the date of the first on- study SSE.   
Time to bone ALP progression  is defined as the time (days) from the date of randomization 
to the date of first bone ALP progression.  Bone ALP  progression is defined as ≥25% increase 
from the baseline value, at least 12 weeks from baseline in subjects with no bone ALP decline 
from baseline;  or ≥25% increase above the nadir value, which is confirmed by a second value 
obtained 4 or more weeks later in subjects with an i nitial bone ALP decline from baseline.  
Bone ALP  response  is defined as ≥30% reduction of the blood level at Week 12 and 4 weeks 
(± 7 days ) after last radium-223 dichloride/pl acebo dose, compared to the baseline value.  
Confirmed bone ALP response is defined as a ≥30% reduction of the blood level, compared to 
the baseline value, confirmed by a second bone ALP value 4 or more weeks later.  
Radiological progression-free survival based on bone imaging ( bone -specific rPFS) is 
defined as the time (days) from the date of randomization to the date of confirmed 
radiological progression detected by [CONTACT_240736] (if death occurs before progression).  Subjects without confirmed radiological progression or death at the time of analysis will be censored at their last date of radiological tumor assessment.  (See SAP for 
detailed censoring rules).  Bone scans will be read locally.  All bone lesions visible on a techn etium-99m bone scan will need to also be imaged using conventional anatomical 
imaging techniques such  as SPECT CT/MRI or  CT/MRI (with or without contrast).  Bone 
progression will be declared according to the modified RECIST 1.1 criteria (see Appendix 16.2).  If a new bone lesion or unequivocal increase in size of bone lesions is 
identified on bone scan, the lesion must also be confirmed by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI.  If a new bone lesion or unequivocal increase in size of bone lesions is only visible on a CT/MRI and not visible on a technetium -99m bone scan, progression will be declared without further confirmation.  
Time to visceral metastases onset  (in subjects with no visceral disease at baseline) is defined 
as the time (days) from the date of randomization to the date of the first scan showing visceral metastatic  disease.

9.6 Safety 
The Investigator(s) and the sponsor ’s repre sentative will review the safety data throughout the 
course of the study.  The following safety variables will be evaluated:  
• Adverse events:  AEs will be collected and recorded on an ongoing basis throughout 
the study as described in Section  9.6.1.  
• Safety variables : Safety variables will include the analysis of acute and long- term 
effects and the appearance of new primary  malignancies  and hematopoietic reserve for 
tolerability of subsequent chemotherapy . Please refer to Section  5.1.[ADDRESS_292356] of variables to be analyzed for this study will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP).  
• Laborat ory assessments:  The following laboratory assessments with reference ranges, 
including Investigator determinations, will be recorded in the source documentation and the eCRF:  
o Hematology: hematocrit, Hb, platelet counts, RBC, WBC, WBC differential. 
o Clinical chemistry: Na, K, Ca,  total cholesterol, ALT, AST, serum creatinine, 
BUN, total bilirubin, total cholesterol,  triglycerides, and glucose . 
o A coagulation panel: PT, PTT, and INR.
  
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be valid for sa fety analysis .  All 
AEs will be reported and graded according to NCI -CTCAE  v4.03.  Laboratory evaluations, 
vital signs, changes in physical examination findings will also be assessed.  
9.6.1 Adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions 
Adverse event  
In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e. , any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom, or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study.  Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. 
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by [CONTACT_240737] d as an AE (however, the condition for which the surgery is 
required may be an AE).

04 DEC 2019  Version 7.0 Page:  81 of 153 
 
Adverse event versus medical history  
In the following differentiation between medical history and AEs, the term “condition” may 
include abnormal physical examination findings, symptoms, diseases, laboratory findings, or scans.  
• Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms or treatment are present until signing of informed consent are considered as medical 
history  (e.g., seasonal allerg y without acute complaints).  
• Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity, are 
considered as medical history (e.g., allergic pollinosis ).  
• Symptoms that were present prior to signing of informed consent but for which the diagnosis was confirmed after signing of informed consent should be documented as medical history . 
• Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed conse nt will be 
documented as adverse events .  
Serious adverse event (SAE)  
An SAE is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any of the following criteria (a  through g): 
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
 The term “life -threate ning”  in the definition refers to an event in which the subject was 
at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
c. Requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_165843].  
 A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23565]:  The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12 hours The admission is pre-planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start of the study)  
 The admission is not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]).  
 However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during an y hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8955] “medically important”  and as such may be reportable as an SAE 
dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local regula tion takes precedence.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity  
 Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]

e. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect  
f. Is another medically important ser ious event as judged by [CONTACT_737] 
g. Is an occurrence of any additional malignancies including AML or hematological 
conditions such as MDS, aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis (regardless of the 
Investigator’s causality assessment).  If disease progression leads to signs and 
symptoms that meet the criteria for seriousness (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), the associated signs and symptoms should be reported as SAEs, not the underlying cause (i.e., “progressive disease” should not be recorded as an SAE).  In this case disease progression should be mentioned on the SAE form as an “alternative explanation.” 
An isolated laboratory abnormality that meets the criteria for CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_292357] International Conference on Harmonisation criteria for an SAE .  All laboratory abnormalities, 
including CTCAE Grade 4 abnormalities, will be documented on the laboratory eCRF (including values reported from central laboratories). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Classifications for adverse event assessment 
All AEs will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_240738].  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_292358] be determined according to the criteria given in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Intensity 
The intensity of an AE should be documented using the NCI-CTCAE v4.03, JUN 2010; see Section  16.1.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Causal relationship  
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment 
is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the eCRF .  The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal 
relationship” to the study treatment in question.   Causal relationship of the study treatment 
exemestane and everolimus and concomitant medication of interest, bisphosphonates or 
denosumab, will also be collected.  
Possible answers are “yes” or “n o” 
An assessment of “no” would include: 
• The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g. , mechanical bleeding at surgical 
study site, 
or 
• Non-plausibility, e.g., the subject is struck by [CONTACT_23634]; cancer developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a few days after the first drug administration. 
An assessment of “yes” indicates that there is a reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_39677].  
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version 7.0 Page:  83 of 153 
 
Important factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment 
include: 
• The temporal sequence from drug administration: The event should occur after the drug is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Recovery on drug discontinuation (de- challenge), recurrence on drug re-introduction 
(re-challenge):  Subject’s response after de- challenge or subject ’s response after re-
challenge should be considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in 
question. 
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases: Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
• Concom itant medication or treatment: The other drugs the subject is taking or the 
treatment the subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them may be suspected to cause the event in question. 
• The pharmacology and PK  of the study treatment:  The PK properties (absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the study treatment, coupled with the individual subject’s pharmacodynamics (PD) should be considered. 
Causal relationship to protocol- required procedure(s)  
The assessment of a possi ble causal relationship between the AE and protocol-required 
procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to protocol-required procedure(s).  Possible answers are “yes” or “no”. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Action taken with study treatment  
Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories  
listed below : 
• Drug withdrawn  
• Drug interrupted  
• Dose reduced  
• Dose not changed 
• Not applicable 
• Unknown 
[IP_ADDRESS].5  Other specific treatment(s) of adverse events 
• None 
• Remedial drug therapy

• Recovering/resolving  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
• Not recovered/not resolved 
• Fatal  
• Unknown 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessments and documentation of adverse events 
All AEs occurring  from the time the subject signs the ICF until [ADDRESS_292359] immediately (within 24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness) be 
reported in the appropriate eCRF .  If more than one AE occurs, each event should be recorded 
separately .  All AEs and SAEs are to be followed until resolved or as clinically required.  
All AEs and SAEs occurring beyond [ADDRESS_292360] be reported as SAEs, regardless of the Investigator’s assessment . 
Note: Specifically for this study, relevant symptoms related to SSEs should be reported as AEs independent of the timing of occurrence (prior to [ADDRESS_292361] dose of study treatment or after this interval) or relationship with study drug. 
All bone fractures and bone associated events (e.g., osteoporosis) should be collected as either 
AEs or SAEs if the cr iteria of SAE were met, regardless of the Investigator’s causality 
assessment.  
Adverse events may be reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_240739] (non-leading) questioning during each visit to the clinic and at the end of the active follow-up period without clinic visits .  As far as possible, all AEs must be described by [CONTACT_240740] 
(start and stop date), severity (graded according to the CTCAE v4.03), relationship to treatment, and according to the need of other specific therapy.  All information will be 
recorded in the source documentation and AE  eCRF.  
A laboratory test abnormality considered clinically relevant (e.g., causing the subject to withdraw from the trial), requiring treatment, causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged as relevant by [CONTACT_737], should be reported as an AE.  Each event should be described in detail along with start and stop dates (onset and resolution of event), intensity, temporal and causal relationship to investigational product and/or protocol  related procedures, 
possibly alternative factors (co morbidities , co-medications), therapeutic action taken, result of

therapeutic action, and ultimate outcome of the AE.  The Investigator’s assessment of AEs 
and laboratory results with grades and causality assessments must be documented and retained in the source documentation.  If more than one AE occurs, each event should be recorded separately .  All AEs and SAEs are to be followed until resolved or as clinically required. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of serious adverse events 
The definition of SAEs is given in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  Each SAE must be followed up until 
resolution or stabilization by [CONTACT_23636][INVESTIGATOR_841]. 
If disease progression leads to signs and symptoms that meet the criteria for seriousness (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) , the associated signs and symptoms should be reported as an SAE, not the 
underlying cause (i.e., “progressive disease” should not be recorded as an SAE) .  In this case, 
disease progression should be mentioned on the SAE form as “alternative explanation”. 
Reporting of additional malignancies 
All occurrences of any additional malignancies including AML, and hematological conditions 
such as MDS, aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis  must be reported as SAEs, regardless of the 
Investigator’s causality assessment  
Investigator’s notification of the sponsor All Investigators will be thoroughly instructed and trained on all relevant aspects of the 
Investigator’s reporting obligations for SAEs.  This information, including all relevant contact [CONTACT_8972], is summarized in the Investigator Site file .  This information will be updated as 
needed.  
All SAEs occurring during the observation period defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] must 
immediately (within 24  hours of the Investigator’s awareness [or the next working day for 
weekends and public holidays]) be reported to the contact [CONTACT_240741] (CRO), as de tailed in the study manual.  An SAE form must also be completed within 
24 hours of the Investigator awareness (or the next working day for weekends and public holidays) and forwarded to the designated recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  Each SAE must be followed up until resolution or stabilization by [CONTACT_240742][INVESTIGATOR_841]. 
Additionally, all occurrences of  MDS , aplastic anemia, or any other new primary malignancy 
such as acute myeloid leukemia must be reported as SAEs at any time, and regardless of the Investigator’s causality assessment  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  All bone fractures and bone associated 
events ( e.g., osteoporosis) need to be reported as either AEs or SAEs , if the criteria of  SAE 
were met, regardless of the Investigator’s causality assessment .  Grade 4 baseline laboratory 
abnormalities that are part of the disease profile should not be reported as SAEs , specifically 
when they are allowed or not excluded by [CONTACT_240743]/exclusion criteria .  If 
Investigators are in doubt about the applicable reporting obligations, they should consult with 
the medical monitor.  
For subjects who die > [ADDRESS_292362] study treatment, submission 
of the AE page of the eCRF is not required.  However, the SAE Complementary Form should be submitted to the applicable Bayer HealthCar e Pharmacovigilance department if the death is 
considered related to study treatment .  In addition, this death information will also be 
collected in the end of active follow -up page of the eCRF. 
Serious AE s occurring after the protocol defined observation period will be processed by [CONTACT_23637].

scientific value, or there are not enough samples or not enough responders to allow for 
adequate biomarker evaluation .  In the event the study is terminated early or does not reach a 
positive primary endpoint, completion of the biomarker assessments will be based on justification and intended utility of the data. Exploratory biomarker data including CTC 
analys is will be reported in a separated biomarker report. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Urine and blood based biomarker analysis 
Blood samples will be obtained from all subjects at the following time points: (1) Cycle 1, Day 1 (Visit 2) and Cycle 4, Day 1 (Visit 8) within 5 days of the visi t prior to radium-223 
dichloride/placebo administration, and within [ADDRESS_292367] . 
• Urine and serum and plasma from blood samples may be evaluated for expression levels of bone- related biomarkers.  Elevated levels of bone biomarkers are indicative 
for e.g., more aggressive disease and are prognostic of worse long- term clinical 
outcome.  In this study, levels of bone biomarkers (measured before, during, and after treatment) that are indicative of bone remodeling (e.g., ALP  and bone ALP , 
procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide) and bone resorption (e.g., urine NTX and I collagen telopeptide [ ICTP ]/ serum C -terminal telopeptide of type I collagen ) may be 
evaluated and correlated with clinical outcomes (including SSEs, survival, and levels of other biomarkers).
  
In addition to the biomarkers listed above, other biomarkers deemed relevant to gain further knowledge about the pathomechanism of the disease and/or about the drug (i.e., mode of action related effect or safety of the drug) may be measured, based on newly emerging data from other ongoing studies and/or literature data. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Collection of circulating tumor cells for biomarker analyses 
Circulatin g tumor c ells (CTCs) are believed to represent a surrogate for tumor cells and can be 
used as surrogate to demonstrate efficacy of the drug by [CONTACT_240745], but also as source of tumor molecular characterization.  
Blood samples will be obtained from all subjects at sites in [LOCATION_009], [LOCATION_013], Israel, Italy, Spain, and the [LOCATION_008] at the following time points: (1) Cycle 1, Day 1 (Visit 2) and every subsequent cycles, Day [ADDRESS_292368]’s total and ideal body weights on Cycle  1, Day 1 of the study; details will be presented in the SAP.

10. Statistical methods and determination of sample size  
10.1 General considerations 
Subjects will be r andomized to radium-223 dichloride/placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  Randomization 
will be stratified by:  
• Geographical regions : Europe/North America [including Israel] versus Asia  
• Previous lines of hormone therapy in metastatic setting (1 versus 2 or more): for the 
purpose of counting the number of prior lines of hormone therapy, only a change of the hormone agent due to progression is counted as a new line of therapy.  A switch of 
hormone therapy from one agent to another due to toxicity or other reasons (e.g., subject’s preference) in absence of PD at time of switch will be counted as one line 
although [ADDRESS_292369] been administered. 
•  Visceral disease: yes v ersus no  
Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS Institute Inc
® (SAS); the version used will be 
specified in the SAP .   
Data from patients who are transferred to the separate extended safety follow -up study may be 
pooled and analyzed together with the data from this study. 
10.2 Analysis sets 
The following 2 populations will be analyzed: 
ITT:  All randomized subjects.  The ITT population will be used in the analysis of all efficacy 
endpoints.  Subjects will be included in all ITT analyses according to the treatment to which 
they are randomized. 
Safety:  All randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of any study drug.  This 
safety population will be used in the analyses of all safety endpoints.  Subjects will be included in the analyses according to the treatment they received.  
10.3 Variables and planned statistical analyses 
Definition  for eac h variable is  given in Section  9.4. 
The primary efficacy variable is SS E-FS.  
The secondary efficacy variables are specified below:  
• OS 
• Time to opi[INVESTIGATOR_240647]  
• Time to pain progression (only in subjects with baseline WPS ≤8) 
• Time to cytotoxic chemotherapy  
• rPFS  
• Pain improvement rate  
Exploratory efficacy variables are:  
• Time to first on -study SSE

BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version 7.0 Page:  89 of 153 
 
• Time to bone ALP  progression 
• Bone ALP response at Week 12 and 4 weeks (±  7 days ) after last radium-223 
dichloride/placebo dose  
• Bone- specific rPFS  
• Time to visceral metastase s onset (in subjects with no visceral disease at baseline)

combined.  Dropout rate is assumed to be 15%.  Dropout was taken into account when calculating the sample size and study duration.  The targeted improvement of 50% is not based on a bibliographical reference. 
Following the administrative data review (per Amendment 8) conducted on DEC [ADDRESS_292375] enrollment in this trial was discontinued on APR 2018, prior to accrual of the originally planned sample size.  
10.5 Planned interim data review  
An administrative interim data review will be performed when a minimum of 80 rPFS events 
is reached. The interim data review will be primarily focus ed on the rPFS, and the interim 
data review  results will inform on future radium-223 clinical development plans in this 
indication.  An independent unblinded review committee will be formed.  
No formal statistical testing will be performed for either SSE -FS or rPFS at the time of this 
interim review. Only summary statistics will be produced. There is no plan to stop the trial due to superior efficacy; therefore, no alpha adjustment is applied for this interim look at the primary endpoint of SSE- FS. The study will remain blinded after the interim data review . 
Details of the interim data review will be provided in the SAP . 
Planned updated analysis  
Following primary analysis, at the closure of the study, after the last subject has discontinued treatment and study assessments, an updated analysis will be performed. The updated analysis will be descriptive only and may consist of listings.  
11. Data handling and quality assurance  
11.[ADDRESS_292376] will be used at the study site  to identify the source 
data for all data points collected and the monitor will work with the study site  to complete 
this. 
Data recorded from “only screened subjects (screening failures)”  
Data of “only screened subjects” will be recorded at least as source data, as far as the reason for the premature discontinuation is identifiable.  At a minimum, data to be recorded in the 
eCRF are demographic information (subject number, date of birth/age, sex, race [if applicable]  and ethnicity), the reason for premature discontinuation and date of last visit.  
These data will be transferred to the respective database.  
For screening failures with an SAE, the following additional data should be collected in the CRF, i n addition to demographic information, primary reason for discontinuation and date of 
last visit:  
• All information about the SAE 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]

o Concomitant medication  
o Medical history  
o Other information needed for SAE complementa ry page  
11.2 Monitoring 
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and sponsor’s/ CRO’s  procedures, monitors 
will contact [CONTACT_240749], study requirements, and their responsi bilities to satisfy regulatory, ethical, and 
sponsor’s requirements.  When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also 
include identification and documentation of source data items. 
The sponsor/designee will monitor the study site  activity to verify that the:  
• Data are authentic, accurate and complete  
• Safety and rights of subjects are being protected  
• Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol  
(including study treatment being used in accordance with the protocol) 
• Any other study agreements, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements are met. 
The Investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the 
monitor direct  access to all relevant documents.  
11.[ADDRESS_292377] data 
necessary for analysis and reporting will be transmitted into a validated database or data system (e.g ., TOSCA; SAS) .  Clinical data management will be performed in accordance with 
applicable sponsor’s standards and data cleaning procedures.  This is applicable for data recorded on eCRF as well as for data from other sources (e.g. , IXRS, laboratory, adjudication 
committees).  
For data coding (e.g. , AEs, medication), internati onally recognized and accepted dictionaries 
will be used such as the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO- DD).  
11.4 Missing data  
Every effort should be made to retain subjects who discontinue the treatment period for any reason.  These subjects are to be encouraged to remain on the study for follow-up of primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints (i.e., continue in the active follow-up period with or without clinic visits).  
The method used for imputation of missing data will be  described in the SAP. 
11.5 Audit and inspection 
To ensure compliance with GCP and regulatory requirements, a member of the sponsor’s (or a designated CRO’s) quality assurance unit may arrange to conduct an audit to assess the perform ance of the study at the study site and of the study documents originating there.  The 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

the maximum period of time permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], institution or private practice .  Where 
the archiving procedures do not meet the minimum timelines required by [CONTACT_456], alternative arrangements must be made to ensure the availability of the source documents for 
the required period. 
The Investigator/institution notifies the sponsor if the archival arrangements change (e.g., 
relocation or transfer of ownership). 
The Investigator Site file is not to be d estroyed without the sponsor’s approval. 
The contract with the Investigator/institution will contain all regulations relevant for the study 
site. 
12. Premature termination of the study  
The sponsor has the right to close this study (or, if applicable, individua l segments thereof 
[e.g., treatment arms; dose steps; sites]) at any time, which may be due but not limited to the 
following reasons:  
• If the risk-benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for example,  
o Results of parallel clinical studies  
o Results of par allel animal studies (e.g., toxicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity 
or reproduction toxicity). 
• If the study conduct (e.g., recruitment rate; drop out rate; data quality; protocol 
compliance) does not suggest a proper completion of the trial within a reaso nable time 
frame.  
The Investigator has the right to close his/her site  at any time.  
For any of the above closures, the following applies: 
• Closures should occur only after consultation between involved parties.  Final decision 
on the closure must be in writ ing. 
• All affected institutions (e.g. , IEC(s)/IRB(s); competent authority(ies); study site ; head 
of study site ) must be informed as applicable according to local law.

15.2.1  Overview of changes to the study

The change will allow assess ment of bone biomarker s at the end o f treatment with 
radium-223, which corresponds to week 24 rather than  at EOT which in this study is intended 
as the end of treatment of all study medications ( radium-223, everolimus and exemestane).  In 
fact exemestane and everolimus treatment may continue beyond week [ADDRESS_292454] experiences progression or unacceptable tolerability.

Modification 3 
The quantification of radium-223 radioactivity in Xofigo® is based on the primary 
standardization performed by [CONTACT_194650] (NIST).  The NIST Standard Reference Material is used to calibrate the instruments in production and quality control of both the drug substance and drug product.  Additionally, the calibrated instruments in production at the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE, Norway) are used to 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version 7.0 Page:  [ADDRESS_292455] traceable radium -223 reference material, which is  then sent to the treatment 
sites (e.g., nuclear medicine laboratory physicians or technicians) for dial-setting of their dose 
calibrators, to allow verification of the patient dose.  A reassessment of the primary standardization was initiated by [CONTACT_194651].  A discrepancy of approximately 10% between the published NIST primary standardization (52) and current measurements was confirmed and a revised NIST primary reference standard has been issued (53).  As a result of the revised NIST primary standardization, an adaption of the numerical description of patient dose and the description of radioactive concentration of the drug product solution becomes necessary.  This concerns Xofigo
® for commercial use and product used in clinical trials.   
After the implementation of the new standard (NIST update [53]) the numerical description of the patient dose will be adjusted from 50 kBq/kg to 55 kBq/kg, and the numerical description of the radioactivity in the vial will be changed from 1,000 kBq/mL to 1,100 kBq/mL.  A respective variation application and substantial amendment to our CTAs have been initiated.   The current standard (NIST 2010 [52]), dial setting and dose will remain in effect  until a 
unique implementation date in Q2 [ADDRESS_292456] date of implementation 
prior to the effective date.  
Justification for changing the dose to 55 kBq/kg body weight: 
A systematic approximately 10% error in the radium-[ADDRESS_292457] standardization (NIST 2010 
[52]) means that the current patient dose and the dose documented as safe and efficacious throughout development is 55 kBq/kg body weight and not 50 kBq/kg body weight as 
declared during clinical trials and in the marketing authorization application / new drug application.  However, as this is a systematic error, the actual dose has been the same all the time.  In order to keep the actual dose for patients identical to what has been documented and 
administered so far, also when implementing the new official standard, the nominal value of 
the patient dose will be changed to 55kBq/kg body weight (NIST update [53]). This change keeps the same accuracy in the nominal value of the dose.  Thus, there will be no actual change in the patient dose (amount of radioactivity), it will be only a change in the dose nominal value when corrected according to the new official radium-[ADDRESS_292458].  All sites will continue to use the cu rrent dial setting (NIST 2010 [52] ) for the activity 
measurements until the implementation date in Q2 2016.  
Justification for changing the description of the radioactivity in the vial to 1,100 kBq/mL:  
A systematic approximately 10% error in the radium-[ADDRESS_292459] (NIST 2010 [52] ) 
means that the Xofigo
® solution for injection with a radioactivity concentration claim of 
1,000 kBq/mL, which has been tested in pi[INVESTIGATOR_240683], 
actually has a concentration of 1,100 kBq/mL. If the drug product concentration is adjusted to 1,100 kBq/mL, the total activity in the vial (6 mL) must be changed from 6,000 kBq/vial to 6,600 kBq/vial (changed from 6.0 MBq/vial to 6.6 MBq/vial in many countries). Xofigo
® 
solution for injection produced according to the new NIST standardization (NIST update  [53] ), 
is the same product as before.   NOTE:   All product received by [CONTACT_240756] 1000 kBq/mL until the implementation date in Q2 2016.

Note: throughout this document the dose of radium-223 dichloride is given as 50 kBq/kg, which is based on the original NIST standardization (NIST 2010 [52]); however, when NIST issues the updated radium-223 dichloride standardization, the dose administered will actually be 55 kBq/kg (based on a change to the reference standard (NIST update [53]) only), though the volume of radium-[ADDRESS_292463] will remain the same.

Rationale: 
The ERA 223 study, a phase III randomized trial in prostate cancer patients examining 
radium-223 dichloride versus placebo in combination with abiraterone and prednisone (study number [ZIP_CODE], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was unblinded based on the IDMC recommendation following an ad hoc independent analysis where more treatment- emergent fractures, SSE -FS, 
and total deaths events were observed in the active treatment arm compared with the placebo arm. Based on these data European Health Authorities requested that all bone fractures and bone associated events (e.g., osteoporosis) occurring during study and in the follow-up period should be documented regardless of the investigator’s causality assessment .

At the time of  the primary analysis, only a limited number of subjects were  receiving study 
medication (exemestane and everolimus).  
After implementation of CSP Amendment 9 , subjects who completed the EOT visit could be 
transferred to a separate extended safety follow -up study for their remaining follow -up. After 
implementation of CSP Amendment 10,  all such subjects will be transferred; only subjects 
on oral treatment will remain on study, and no po st-treatment data will be collected beyond 
the 30-day safety follow-up (EOT visit).   
As the key efficacy objectives will have been accomplished, long- term safety transferred, and 
only a limited number of subjects will remain in this study, in order to red uce the burden to 
study subjects, collection of data will be reduced and will focus mainly on acute safety, SSE, 
and OS. Accordingly, the updated analysis following the closure of the study will be 
descriptive only and may consist of listings. Once subjects are rolled over, the long- term 
safety will be collected and assessed entirely in the separate extended safety follow -up study.

analysis  Removal of 80% CI 
from the secondary

endpoints.  Per Sponsor decision, there is no need to 
report 2 different confidence intervals for every endpoint in a study that is being terminated. The 95% CI was retained as it 
is the most commonly used CI in the 
literature. Of note, both CIs will be retained for the primary endpoint.  The 80% value corresponds to the 10% 1- sided 
hypothesis test (equivalent to 20% 2-
sided) used as the basis of study power.

16.2 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) 
Disease response and progression will be evaluated in this study using a modified version of RECIST version 1.1.( 51)  The modificatio n refers to bone lesions assessment: all bone lesions 
are considered non -measurable and new bone lesions identified by [CONTACT_240760] (CT/MRI).  
Definitions:  
Bone lesions : malignant findings in skeleton.  
Soft tissue  lesions:  M alignant finding in soft tissue: skin, subcutaneous, muscle, fat, lymph 
nodes. 
Visceral lesions :  Malignant finding in visceral organs: lung, liver, brain, etc.  
Measurable lesions :  Lesions that, at baseline, meet the requirements for being reproducibly 
quantifiable (see section below for detailed definition of measurable lesions).  
Non-measurable lesions :  Lesions that, at baseline, do not meet the below- described 
requirements .  These lesions cannot be chosen for quantitative assessment, and must be 
assessed qualitatively only.  
Target lesions :  Lesions that are chosen at baseline (from the set of measurable lesions) for 
quantitative assessment throughout the trial, using rules outlined below.  A lesion that has been selected as a target lesion remains a target lesion for the rest of the trial.  
Non-target lesions:  Lesions that are not chosen at baseline for quantitative assessment, and 
must be assessed qualitatively throughout the trial .  A lesion that has been selected as a non -
target lesion re mains a non -target lesion for the rest of the trial.  
Methods of Measurement:  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. 
All measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
For measurements of tumors other than lymph nodes, the longest unbroken diameter seen on 
an axial slice is recorded.  
Lymph nodes must always be measured in the short axis (the longest measurem ent on an axial 
slice perpendicular to the longest diameter of the lymph node).  Lymph nodes less than [ADDRESS_292484]/MRI of chest/abdomen/pelvis and any additional sites of disease (if clinically indicated) will be performed for all patients.

with careful identification of all disease -related hotspots.  
If FDG PET/CT or FDG PET scan is performed as part of the standard of pra ctice imaging,  
the results of the FDG PET scan can be used as a complement to CT scanning in the assessment of disease progression – based on occurrence of new lesions – as per the RECIST 
1.1 algorithm ( See section on New lesions in this appendix). 
The CT component of the FDG PET/CT scan, as per RECIST 1.1, can be used for tumor 
measurements only if the site can document that the CT
 performed as part of a FDG PET/CT 
scan is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT . 
FDG PET/CT or 18F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan is 
acceptable as an alternative to technetium -99m bone scintigraphy if it is the standard of care at 
the institution, provided the same bone imaging modality is used throughout the study. 
Clinical lesions might be assessed clinically only as per the following rules: clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g. , skin nodules, palpable 
lymph nodes) and ≥10mm diameter as assessed using calipers.  For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended.  
Baseline Assessment : 
Identifying measurable disease:  
Non-nodal malignant lesions : Measurable lesions are those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
• [ADDRESS_292486] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) or MRI .  If scans 
with slice thickness greater than 5mm are used, the minimum size should be twice the slice thickness.  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_12148] (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable) 
Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged, a lymph node must be ≥ 
[ADDRESS_292487] be ≥ [ADDRESS_292488] scan.  
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are not considered measurable unless 
there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. 
Identifying non- measurable disease:  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10  mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with short axis 10-14 mm) are considered non- measurable disease.  
Bone lesions: 
All b one lesions (blastic, lytic, mixed type) will be considered non-measurable lesions.   
Selection of target and non -target lesions:  
At basel ine, lesions are divided into those that will be followed quantitatively (target lesions) 
and those that will be followed qualitatively (non- target lesions).  
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version 7.0 Page:  140 of 153 
 
Target lesions : 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in tot al, 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and be recorded and 
measured at baseline.  These lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesion with the longest diameter/short axis for lymph nodes), be representative of all involved organs and should be suitable for reproducible repeated measurements.  
For the purposes of this selection, all lymph nodes should be regarded as a single organ.  If 
there are multiple chains/regions, consider selecting one from each. The sum of the diameters (longest diameter for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) 
for all target lesions will be calculated by [CONTACT_240762]/short axis (for lymph nodes) and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.  The baseline sum of diameters will be used as the reference measurement when looking for evidence of objective response at later visits.  
If there are more than 5 measurable lesions, those not selected as target lesions will be 
considered together with non- measurable disease as non -target lesions.  
Non-target lesions:  
Non-target lesions include all non -measurable lesions, plus any measurable lesions over and 
above the maximum [ADDRESS_292489]-baseline assessment : 
At every response assessment visit after baseline, the Investigator will assess the following:  
• target lesions selected at baseline, and  
• non-target lesions selected at baseline,  and   
• search for new lesions.  
The lesion assessments are then combined into an assessment of the entire subject at that visit (called the visit response or the overall response). 
Target lesion assessment : 
The Investigator will measure each target lesion in the same manner as at baseline.  
Malignant lymph nodes will be measured in short axis diameter.  
If a lesion decreases in size to the point where it is still present, but cannot be measured 
accurately, a default value of [ADDRESS_292490] diameter of the entire resulting lesion should be 
measured.  
The sum of diameters will be calculated by [CONTACT_240762]/short axis (for 
lymph nodes).  
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version 7.0 Page:  141 of 153 
 
The sum of diameters is always compared to 2 reference points: the basel ine sum of 
diameters, and the smallest sum of diameters seen during the trial (also called the nadir) .  The 
baseline may actually be the nadir, if there has been no reduction in the sum of diameters 
during the trial.  The target lesion response is then classified as follows  in Table 16–1. 
Table 16–1:  Target lesion response  
Response  Response characteristics  
Complete response (CR)  Complete disappearance of target lesions  
All target lymph nodes <10 mm  
Partial response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease  in the sum of diameters 
from baseline  
Progressive disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase  in the sum of diameters 
from the smallest value seen during the trial 
(including baseline), with at least a 5 mm  absolute 
increase in the sum  
Stable disease (SD)  Neither enough shrinkage to qualify as PR, nor 
enough growth to qualify as PD  
Non-evaluable (NE)  One or more target lesions not evaluated because 
of imaging issues, coverage, or change in imaging 
technique  
Please note that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, a CR may occur even when 
the sum of diameters is not zero, since a normal lymph node will have a diameter greater than 
zero but less than 10 mm.  
Non-target lesion assessment : 
Non-target lesions are assessed as a whole.  After examining each non -target lesion, the 
Investigator will classify the non -target lesion response as follows in  Table 16–2. 
Table 16–2 :  Non-target lesion response  
Response  Response characteristics  
Complete response (CR)  Complete disappearance of all non -target lesions  
All non -target lymph nodes <10 mm  
Progressive disease (PD ) Unequivocal progression of non -target lesions as 
a whole.  
• Subjective call by [CONTACT_240763]  
• Evaluated as a group, not lesion by [CONTACT_240764]-CR/Non -PD Non-target lesions still present, without 
unequivocal progression  
Non-evaluable (NE)  One or more non -target lesions not evaluated 
because of imaging issues, coverage, or change 
in imaging technique  
To achieve unequivocal progression in patients with measurable disease on the basis of the 
non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial wo rsening in non- target 
disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non- target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression. 
New lesions : 
Any new lesion that is considered unequivocally malignant is evidence of progression, with no minimum size requirement.  
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version 7.0 Page:  [ADDRESS_292491] detected.  
Specific considerations for new bone lesions and for unequivocal progression of existing bone lesions:  
The finding of a new bone lesion or progression of existing bone lesions should be unequivocal: i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor:  some new bone lesions or unequivocal increase in size of existing lesions may be simpl y healing or flare of pre -
existing lesions.  
The following rules will apply: 
• A new bone lesion or progression of existing bone lesion/s initially identified on a Tc99m bone scan must be confirmed by [CONTACT_462].  If confirmed by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI, the date of occurrence of the new lesion or of progression of existing bone lesion/s will be the date it was initially detected (by [CONTACT_21851]99m bone scan) even if the confirmation by 
[CONTACT_4654]/MRI was done at a subsequent scan.   
• A new bone lesion or progression of existing bone lesions ini tially identified by 
[CONTACT_4654]/MRI (and not visible on a Tc99m bone scan) will not need further confirmation by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI unless not considered unequivocal at time of initial documentation.  The date of occurrence of new lesion or progression of existing lesions will be the date it wa s 
initially detected by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI.  
New lesions and FDG PET imaging
 
New lesions on the basis of FDG PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm: 
• (-) FDG PET at baseline and (+) FDG PET at follow -up = Progressive Disease (PD) 
based on a new lesion 
• No FDG PET at baseline and (+) FDG PET at follow-up = PD if the new lesion is 
confirmed on CT. If a subsequent CT confirms the new lesion, the date of P D is the 
date of the initial FDG PET scan.  
• No FDG PET at baseline and (+) FDG PET at follow -up corresponding to a pre-
existing lesion on CT that is not progressing is not PD  
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG PET scan lesion means one with uptake greater than twice that of the 
surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image 
Visit response: 
The response of the target lesions, the response of the non- target lesions, and the presence or 
absence of new lesions are combined into the visit response for the entire subje ct at this visit, 
using the tables below.

The following text descriptions of the visit response are logically equivalent to the tables 
above.  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor 
(both target and non- target ).  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) 
must have a reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions 
taking as reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of existing non- target 
lesions and no appearance of new lesions. Stable Disease (SD) :  Steady state of disease.  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to q ualify for PD, no unequivocal progression of existing non- target 
lesions and no appearance of new lesions. Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions 
from the smallest sum on -study (this includes the baseli ne sum if that is the smallest on -
study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.  Unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions or the 
appearance of one or more new lesion s also constitutes progressive disease.  Ascites or pleural 
effusion will be recorded as disease progression only if proven malignant. 
In the absence of target disease, the following will apply  (Table 16–4).

16.[ADDRESS_292494] on daily functions will be self- assessed by [CONTACT_240768]- SF (54) measure.  
The BPI -SF allows subjects to rate the severity of their pain and the degree to which their pain 
interferes with common dimensions of feeling and function (e.g., general activity, walking, 
work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep). The BPI-SF is an 11- item, 
self-administered, clinically valid, reliable, and responsive measure developed to assess pain 
related to cancer. The instrument is available in validated multilingual versions; on average, it requires less than 10 minutes to complete the questionnaire.
 
All BPI [INVESTIGATOR_240688]. Four items measure pain intensity (pain now, average pain, worst pain, and least pain) using 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) numeric rating scales, and 7 items measure the level of interference with function caused by [CONTACT_77368] (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life) using 0 (no interference) to 10 (complete interference) rating scales. It has a [ADDRESS_292495] at Dose 1, Day 1 (before the sta rt of study 
treatment), at each treatment visit, at the end of treatment visit and follow -up clinic visits. At 
the beginning of each scheduled visit, before meeting with the I nvestigator, subjects will be 
asked to complete the BPI -SF, with the exception of Question 2 (locating areas of pain on a 
diagram) and Question 7 (regarding use of pain medication). Subjects will not be asked to answer Question 2 because the information will not be used for the score. Subjects will not be asked to answer Question 7 bec ause pain medication used is captured elsewhere in the eCRF. 
The items are aggregated into 2 dimensions: (1) Pain Severity Index, using the sum of the 4 items on pain intensity and (2) Function Interference Index , using the sum of the 7 pain 
interference items. The Function Interference Index is scored as the mean of the item scores 
multiplied by 7, given that more than 50% (or 4 of 7), of the items have been completed.
 
The BPI -SF should be self- administered  by [CONTACT_240769] a t the 
site. The instrument should be administered at the start of the visit, before the subject sees the physician so that any interaction between the subject and physician will not influence the 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]  
04 DEC 2019  Version 7.0 Page:  [ADDRESS_292496]’s responses to the questionnaire. The questionnaire should also be administered before 
the subject is asked about AEs and concurrent illnesses, again so that any discussions of health problems do not inf luence the subject’s responses.
 
A quiet place should be provided for the subject to complete the BPI- SF. It is important that 
the subject completes the BPI -SF alone, without any advice from family members or friends 
who may accompany her. 
How should the Questionnaire be introduced?  
A sample script for introducing the questionnaire is given below.  
“Your doctor would like to better understand how you feel, how well you are able to do your 
usual activities, and how you rate your health. To help us better understand these things about you, we will ask you to complete this questionnaire about your health on the day of each clinic visit. Remember that this is not a test and there are no right or wrong answers. Choose the answer that best describes the way you feel. I will quickly review the questionnaire when you are done to make sure that all the questions have been answered. You should answer these questions by [CONTACT_202699]. Your spouse or other family members should not help you when you answer the questionnaire. I will be nearby [CONTACT_240770]. Please let me know when you have finished the questionnaire.”
  
What to do if the subject asks for clarification?  
Some subjects may ask the meaning of specific questions. If this happens, the staff member 
can assist the subject by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-reading the question for them verbatim. If the subject asks what something means, do not try to explain what the question means, but tactfully suggest that the subject use her  own interpretation of the question. All subjects should answer the questions 
based on what they think the questions mean, or the study results may b e biased.  
Questionnaire completion and review of worst pain score over the previous [ADDRESS_292497] is still unable to answer the question, accept the questionnaire as is.  
Some subjects may be confused by [CONTACT_240771]. They may want to respond with “I 
don’t know” or some other response choice that is not available. If this happens, try to help the subject choose one of the response categ ories by [CONTACT_240772]: “I know that it 
may be difficult for you to choose an answer, but which of these answers do you think comes closest to the way that you are thinking or feeling?” If the subject still cannot select an answer, accept the quest ionnaire as is.  
Occasionally, subjects may not report having difficulty with a question or the response choices, but still may hesitate or refuse to answer an item or items. If this happens, accept the questionnaire as is.

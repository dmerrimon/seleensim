 1.0 Introduction and Background  
1.1 Dietary sources of fatty acids  
 
Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (FA) can be synthesized by [CONTACT_485218].  By [CONTACT_22242], polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are essential FA that 
cannot be synthesized by [CONTACT_485219]. Thus the PUFA 
content of a tissue is dependent mainly on dietary intake. The shortest of the omega -6 
series of PUFA is linoleic acid (LA, 18:2, n -6) which is abundant in corn, sunflower, 
safflower , olive  and other  vegetable oils. Its 18 carbon omega -3 counterpart, α -linolenic 
acid (ALA, 18:3, n -3), is also a plant product found in leafy vegetables such as kale, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_87957], broccoli and Brussels sprouts as well as walnuts and seeds such as flax and 
mustard. Both LA and ALA are converted through a series of enzymes to longer c hain 
PUFA: LA to arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4, n -6), and ALA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 
20:5, n -3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, n -3). LA is the most abundant FA in 
Western diets with consumption in the US that is 10-fold that of ALA (reviewed in (1)).  
Cell culture and animal studies have shown that that a high intake of LA lowers the 
conversion of ALA to EPA (2) and that the major source of EPA and DHA in humans is 
the dietary intake of salt water fish (3).

cancer incidence and calories from fish oil (4, 5). Nevertheless, current epi[INVESTIGATOR_485211] (6-8).  
One problem is t hat these studies have relied on data from self -reported dietary FA 
intakes or from estimates based on national consumption assessments that correlate 
poorly with direct measurements of FA in patient samples. The effect of n -[ADDRESS_623450] to use adipose tissue as a primary 
exposure measure for dietary fat intake (9). In this study, a lower ratio of n -6/n-[ADDRESS_623451] cancer pat ients 
compared to control individuals (10).  However outstanding gaps in existing knowledge 
of the potential benefit of n -[ADDRESS_623452]  tissues and an understanding of how dietary PUFA metabolism may contribute to 
and be altered in the neoplastic state.   
   
New data from the Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS) indicates that the risk 
of breast cancer recurrence can be reduced by a consuming a low fat diet (11). However, 
no attention was paid to specific FA species in the diet or how this might impact the FA 
content of breast tissue. Two earlier studies, one conducted with Japanese (12), the other 
CCCWFU [ADDRESS_623453] Carcinoma  
 
2 
 with Finnish patients (13), identified increases in total PUFA in cancer compared to 
benign breast tissue. No such data are available for patients consuming “Western” diets.  
Finally, studies extant assume a tight or even 1:1 relation between PUFA in plasma, red 
blood cells (RBC), and breast cancer. Although many studies including our own in non -
human primates (14) have demonstrated that plasma FA profiles reflect dietary intake, 
our preliminary studies contradict th e notion that RBC and to a lesser extent plasma 
measurements reflect the milieu in breast tissue.  
 
Mechanisms for modification of cancer risk by [CONTACT_485220].  Studies in rodents strongly 
support a promoting role of omega -[ADDRESS_623454] cancer (15-21): the growth of primary as well as metastatic tumors  is inhibited by 
[CONTACT_139803] -[ADDRESS_623455] cancer xenografts, lung metastases w ere inhibited 
by [CONTACT_485221] -3 PUFA initiated before or after surgical removal 
of the primary tumors (22). Dietary omega -3 PUFA also increased the efficacy of 
chemotherapeutic agents, doxorubicin (23) and mitomycin C, (24) in inhibiting tumor 
growth. These studies strongly suggest potential benefits of omega -[ADDRESS_623456] often cited mode for omega -3 
PUFA action is their ability to block metabolism of omega -6 PUFA, AA and LA (25-28).  
When AA and LA are released from cell membrane phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], they are oxygenated 
by [CONTACT_485222] (COX) -1/2, 5 -lipoxygenase (LOX), 12 -LOX, and 15 -LOX -1/2 to 
prostaglandin (PG)E 2, 5-hydroxy -eicosatetraenoate (HETE), 12 -HETE, 15 -HETE, and 
13- hydroxy -octadecadienoic acid (HODE) (27, 29-32). These metabolites can promote 
breast cancer growth and the pathways making them may be overactive in breast cancer 
(27, 29-34). In contrast, omega -3 PUFA inhibit the release and metabolism of AA and 
LA to reduce formation of the omega -6 PUFA metabolites (27, 29-32, 35). Thus, the 
development and malignant behavior of breast cancer may reflect the overproductio n of 
omega -[ADDRESS_623457] cancer cells (29, 32, 35-37).  
Recent studies, including those in animals and humans, continue this disagreement.  
COX -[ADDRESS_623458] cancer; COX -[ADDRESS_623459] tumors and  Cox-2 knockout suppresses these tumors (33, 
34). Indeed, drugs that block COX -[ADDRESS_623460] cancer in human epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037] (38) as well as  mouse models of breast 
cancer (39-41). COX -1 may contribute to these effects or, in the absence of COX -2, 
mediate them (34, 35). On the other hand, [ADDRESS_623461] cancer cells, and 5 -LOX metabolites 5 -
HETE and 5 -oxo-ETE (made  from 5 -HETE by a dehydrogenase; both act on cells 
through a common receptor, OXE (42)), are mor e effective than PGE [ADDRESS_623462] cancer cells to proliferate (43-47). Furthermore, mRNA for 5 -LOX 
and its activating protein (FLAP) are increased in human malignant as opposed to normal 
breast tissue and in node (+) compared to node ( -) disease; FLAP message levels 
correlate negatively with overall and disease -free survival (48, 49). Studies focusing on 
the 12 -LOX/[ADDRESS_623463] cancer cell proliferation  (47) but forced expression of [ADDRESS_623464] cancer cells in vitro and in mice (50).  12-
LOX -p message is over -expressed in malignant compared to normal human breast tissue 
and cell lines (32, 48, 51) and, when coupled with FLAP mRNA levels, provides a better 
prognostic indicator of overall and disease -free survival in breast cancer than FLAP 
mRNA alone  (49).  Studies of [ADDRESS_623465] cancer cells (46, 52) but 
mRNA and protein levels of their parent oxygenases, [ADDRESS_623466] tissue (48, 53).  Patients with 
low levels of message and protein for these oxygenases, or low 15 -LOX -1/15-LOX -[ADDRESS_623467] higher recurrence rates and shortened survivals (53).  
Thus, a [ADDRESS_623468] cancer cells metabolize LA to 13 -HODE through the action of 15 -LOX’s 
(and COX -1/2) (54). 13-HODE is implicated in the proliferation, invasiveness, and 
metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells (54, 55). 
 
It is fair to say that the animal and human breast cancer studies to date have : 1) assigned 
multiple a nd often contradictory roles to the oxygenases and omega -[ADDRESS_623469] cancer ; 2) omitted companion studies on normal breast tissue ; 3) not 
addressed the role of diet in modifying the lipid milieu of breast tissue ; and most 
importantly , 4) focused on one or a limited range of oxygenases without measuring the 
metabolites per se. Because of the difficulty in measuring the metabolites, this last failure 
represents a critical barrier to progress in understanding the role(s) of PUFA in breas t 
cancer. Studies typi[INVESTIGATOR_485212] -6 PUFA metabolites using high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or immunoassays in animals or cultured 
cells but generally have not examined humans. HPLC assays do not distinguish between 
close ly eluting metabolites (e.g. PGE 2 versus PGE 3) nor detect metabolites much below 
[ADDRESS_623470] developed a multiple 
response monitoring -liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectroscopy (MRM -LC/ 
MS/MS) method that measures pg  levels of PUFA metabolites in tissues to answer these 
vital questions.   
CCCWFU [ADDRESS_623471] tissue removed at surgery and compare the two 
groups. Further, we hypothesize  that a defined level of omega -3 PUFA dietary 
supplementation will: 1) “reset” the PUFA  metabolic pathway in malignant breast cells to 
one associated  with a better prognosis by [CONTACT_485223] -6 PUFA 
metabolites , and 2) fuel the production of omega -[ADDRESS_623472] cancer and carcinoma in situ (including 
lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS] and ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS])

5.2 Omega -3 PUFA Supplementation  
 
Participants will be randomized to receive either two  grams of omega -3 PUFA or 
placebo daily until the day before surger y. Omega -3 PUFA is supplied as a one 
gram capsule (see section 8.[ADDRESS_623478]). Placebos will 
be identical to the omega -3 supplements in size and color and will contain 99% 
soybean oil and less than 1% each of natural vitamin E, natural lemon flavor, 
marine lipid, and rosemary extract . PUFA and placebo capsu les will be certified  
toxin -free product s, and PUFA capsules will have verified EPA and DHA levels.  
 
Patients on both arms of the study will be instructed to take two capsules daily 
from the day after enrollment and the last two capsules the day prior to surgery.   Baseline  Intervention

 The date that surgery is planned will be known at the time of randomization and 
an ample amount of the appropriate capsules will be supplied by [CONTACT_66787], plu s four days’ worth of extra capsules. If there is a delay in the planned 
surgery, the patient will be told to continue taking the capsules as directed until 
the day prior to the revised surgery date.  
 
After one week of taking the capsules, the research nu rse will call the patient to 
assess for adverse effects, self -reported compliance, confirm the surgery date, and 
address any other issues. In the event that the extra capsules are not sufficient to 
cover the remaining time until the scheduled date of surge ry, additional capsules 
can be mailed to the patient’s home if needed. If the patient remains on study 
beyond 7 days, then additional phone calls will occur at day 14 and day 21 (and 
every seven days thereafter) until the patient undergoes surgery. Appendi x C 
should be used to document the information obtained during these phone calls.   
 
5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care 
Guidelines  
 
The u se of any NSAID or full-dose ASA -containing  NSAID while taking study 
drug prohibited. Should the use of these agents be deemed necessary, the 
participant in question will be discontinued from the study.  Participants will be 
asked to use acetaminophen if needed during the study.  
 
All other medications and/or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_393366] e intervention period will be 
performed as per standard of care, at the discretion of the participant’s physician.  
5.[ADDRESS_623480] participation extends from enrollment (at the clinic visit for the initial 
diagnosis) until the perioperative collection of study tissue specimens (usually 7 -
14 days).  There will be no follow -up period, and the need for subject 
discontinuation is expected to be minimal. Nonetheless, participants will be 
withdrawn from the study in the event of any o f the following:  
 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study,  
 Patient develops the need to use of any NSAID or full -dose ASA -containing 
NSAID between biopsy and surgery, or 
 General or  specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
  
CCCWFU [ADDRESS_623481] been voiced regarding omega -3 PUFA 
supplementation aggravating bleeding; however, a recent study confirmed 
findings of prior smaller studies and failed to demonstrate any incr eased 
hemorrhagic risk across a variety of indices. (56)   
 
Possible adverse events include nausea, burpi[INVESTIGATOR_485213], or 
gastrointestinal problems. (57) 
6.2 Adverse Ev ent Characteristics  
 
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading 
scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_623482] access to a copy of the CTCAE 
version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the 
CTEP web site ( http://ctep.canc er.gov ). 
 
 ‘Expectedness’ : AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ (see Section 7.1 
above) for expedited reporting purposes only.   
 
 Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the  study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
6.3 STRC SAE Reporting Requirements  
 
The Safety and  Toxicity Reporting Committee (STRC) is responsible for 
reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional studies as outlined in Appendix B. 
STRC currently requires that all unexpected 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on these trials 
be reported to them for review. All Clinic al Research Management (CRM) staff 
members assisting a Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_380210], documenting and 
reporting an SAE qualifying for STRC reporting are responsible for informing a 
clinical member of the STRC as well as the entire committee via t he email 
notification procedure of the occurrence of an SAE.

 6.4  WFUHS IRB AE Reporting Requirements  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and adverse 
events shall be promptly reported to the  IRB, according to institutional policy .  
Reporting to the IRB is required regardless of the funding source, study sponsor, 
or whether the event involves an investigational or marketed drug, biologic or 
device.  Reportable events are not limited to physica l injury, but include 
psychological, economic and social harm.  Reportable events may arise as a result 
of drugs, biological agents, devices, procedures or other interventions, or as a 
result of questionnaires, surveys, observations or other interactions w ith research 
subjects.  
 
All members of the research team are responsible for the appropriate reporting to 
the IRB and other applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk to 
subjects or others.  The Principal Investigator, however, is ultimate ly responsible 
for ensuring the prompt reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to 
subjects or others to the IRB.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_485214] a change in the 
risks and/or benefits to study participants, and whether any changes in the 
informed consent, protocol or other study -related documents are required.  
 
Any unanticipated proble ms involving risks to subjects or others occurring at a 
site where the study has been approved by [CONTACT_399338] (internal events) 
must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or 
other members of the study team becoming aware  of the event.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at 
another site conducting the same study that has been approved by [CONTACT_399339] (external events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar 
days of the i nvestigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of 
the event.  
 
Any event, incident, experience, or outcome that alters the risk versus potential 
benefit of the research and as a result warrants a substantive change in the 
research protocol or  informed consent process/document in order to insure the 
safety, rights or welfare of research subjects.  
7.[ADDRESS_623484] description :  The omega -3 supplements used in this study will be  
provided by [CONTACT_162987] . The specific omega -3 formulation to be used in this 
study is  ProOmega®, a marine oil concentration containing omega -3 PUFA, 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and doxosahexaenoic acid (DHA), supplied in 
triglyceride form. Each 2 capsule dose contains 650 EPA / 450 DHA per 2 soft 
gels. 
 
Route of administration:   Patients will take two capsules by [CONTACT_265015].  
7.2 Pharmaceutical Information for Placebo  
 
Placebos used in this study will also be supplied by [CONTACT_162987] . Each capsule 
will be identical in size and shape to the PUFA supplements;  however they will 
contain 99% soybean oil and less than 1% each of natural vitamin E, natural 
lemon flavor, marine lipid, and rosemary extract.   Patients randomized to receive 
placebo will take two capsules by [CONTACT_265015].  
8.0 Correlative/Special Studies  
 
Between 5 and 10 0mg of  tumor tissue and a similarly -sized section of adjacent normal 
tissue (obtained from site s equidistan t from the site of prior fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) will be 
retrieved at surgery and immediately  divided  into sections for separate analys es of the 
meta bolites and PUFA. For metabolites, a section is placed in 1 ml of tris -buffered saline 
(4 ºC, pH 7.4) containing 100 μM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid to chelate metals 
that attack alkenes, 80 μM of butylated hydroxytoluene to prevent oxidation, and 5 ng of 
each deuterated metabolite to serve as internal standards.  For PUFA, a section  will be 
suspended in ethanol (4 ºC) containing 80 μM butylated hydroxytoluene and 100 μM 
triphenyl -phosphine. Samples on ice will be transported to our lab. Metabolite sa mples 
will be extracted with hexane:  ethyl acetate (1:1) . Extracts will be blown dry under a 
stream of N 2, taken up in methanol, and stored under Argon at -80 ºC. PUFA samples 
will be stored at -80º under Argon in their original ethanol -inhibitor solution and 
extracted immediately before GC analysis .  
 
All tissues will be coded  with a unique identifier  so that patient identities cannot be 
discerned . 
 
Whole blood (4 ml) will be drawn into EDTA -containing tubes from patients both at 
baseline and immediately b efore surgery; placed on ice; adjusted to  100 μM in 
diethylenetriamine -pentaacetic acid and 80 μM butylated hydroxytoluene; transported on 
ice to our lab  (Hanes 4032, contact [CONTACT_485224] -West at 336 -716-3443 who will 
transport samples from OR to the lab ); and centrifuged (1000g, 5 min, 4 º).  RBC will be 
washed with tris -buffered saline (pH 7.4) and suspended in buffer containing [ADDRESS_623485] Carcinoma  
 
12 
 butylated hydroxytoluene and 100 μM triphenylphosphine. RBC and plasma (1 ml) are 
stored at -[ADDRESS_623486] cancer surgery. Tissue 
blocks will be obtained from the Department of Pathology archives for the preparation of 
slides for cleaved caspase -3 immunostaining in our laboratory.  
 
For MRM -LC/MS/MS, breast tissues will be spi[INVESTIGATOR_485215] (5 ng) of

breakdown ion masses ( Table 1) relative to 
other monitored and unmonitored metabolites.   
 
Data are converted to pg/mg wet tissue weight 
and then corrected for  processing losses by 
[CONTACT_485225].  We validated the 
accuracy and precision of this method and 
determined the linearity of recoveries over 1 
pg-100 ng of each metabolite in cultured 
mouse prostate cancer cells.  Our MS system 
is a Waters Quatro II with a Z -spray interface 
and automated by a Spark Holland LC and a 
Reliance Autosampler and Conditioned 
Staker maintained at 4 ºC.  We use a c one voltage of 35V and a capi[INVESTIGATOR_36897] 2.4  
kV for HETE, HODE, and DHA metabolites and 50V and 3.5 kV for PG metabolites.  
The LC system  for the latter three types of metabolites is a Waters Corp YMC ODS -AQ 
1.00 mm I.D.x100 mm length  column eluted at  0.05 ml/min with 2  mM NH 4OAc, pH

1Includes 30 patients with invasive ductal cancer  in each dietary treatment group .  PUFA are analyzed by [CONTACT_27199], 
metabolites by [CONTACT_485226] -LC/MS/MS; OH ( i.e. HETE/  HODE/ HDHA) metabolites require two separate MRM -
LC/MS/MS runs.  
    
9.0 Statistical Considerations  
9.1  Study Design/Endpoints  
 
This is a randomized, placebo controlled  phase II trial assessing the effect of omega -3 
dietary supplementation on PUFA levels ( LA, AA, EPA, DHA, total omega -6 PUFA, 
total omega -3 PUFA and n -6/n-3 PUFA ratios ), metabolites of omega -3 and omega -6 
PUFA  (see Table 1), and proliferation and apoptosis  in women with stage I -III breast 
cancer. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to omega -[ADDRESS_623490] of summary statistics (means, standard deviations, 
proportions, etc.) for pati ent characteristics and outcome measures (including toxicities) 
by [CONTACT_2939]. Tables, graphs, and charts will be used to illustrate the data when 
appropriate. Accrual and toxicity are followed by [CONTACT_485227], and adverse ev ents will be reported to the IRB.  
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to assess the effect of omega -[ADDRESS_623491] differs in the two tissue types (tissue type by [CONTACT_9866]). Since 
we will have pretreatment PUFA levels in the serum , we will use analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) to assess the omega -[ADDRESS_623492] in plasma and RBC, where the baseline levels 
of the PUFAs will be included as covariates.  In all analyses, residuals will be assessed to 
determine if the assumptions of variance ho mogeneity and normality (and linearity for 
the ANCOVA models) are met, and transformations will be used if needed. The 
secondary outcomes will be analyzed using the same methods as described for the 
primary outcomes.  
9.3  Sample Size/Power  
Sixty patients will be accrued to this stu dy, approximately [ADDRESS_623493] deviation (SD) difference between treatment 
groups in PUFA levels with 80% power at the 5% overall level of significance (allowing 
for multiple comparisons by [CONTACT_2329] a Bonferroni correction – each tes t done at the 0. 05/7 
level of significance), assuming a 10% drop -out rate. The anticipated accrual rate for this 
study is two patients per month.  
9.4  Stratification/Randomization  
There are no strata in this study. All eligible patients will be randomized to omega -[ADDRESS_623494] Carcinoma

 Appendix  B – Mandatory STRC  SAE Notificatio n Procedure  
 
Mandatory S afety and Toxicity Review Committee (STRC) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
Reporting Requirements – Revised 6/05/2012  
 
This document describes STRC reporting and use of the electronic submission form that is 
submitted for unexpected grade 4 and any grade 5 (death during protocol intervention) 
SAEs on CCCWFU Institutional interventional trial patients . There are multiple entities that 
require reporting of SAEs. Each entity has different rules for what is reported, and ho w it is 
reported.  
 
Rules used by [CONTACT_485230] (Institutional Review Board (IRB), AdEERS, MedWatch, etc.) 
should NOT be used to evaluate whether an event should be reported to STRC. Only the rules for 
reporting described in this document should be consid ered.  
 
As defined in the NCI summary IV reporting guidelines, CCCWFU Institutional studies 
covered by [CONTACT_399348]: In-house, internally reviewed 
trials, including those collaborative studies conducted with industry sponsorsh ip in which 
the center is a primary contributor to the design, implementation, and monitoring of the 
trial, or participation in a multi -site trial initiated by [CONTACT_485231].   Institutional trials are almost  always authore d by a researcher here at 
CCCWFU. Institutional protocols are labeled NCI Code=”I” for Institutional on the protocol 
screen in ORIS. Cooperative group protocols are not considered Institutional, but Research Base 
trials are classified as Institutional.  
 
The STRC  is responsible for reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional studies, as defined 
above. STRC currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on these trials be 
reported to them for review. All Clinical Research Management (CRM) staff m embers assisting 
a PI [INVESTIGATOR_485216] a clinical member of the STRC by [CONTACT_648], followed by [CONTACT_485232].  
 
THESE REPORTI NG REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO EVERYONE WORKING WITH 
CANCER CENTER INSTITUTIONAL PROTOCOLS.  
 
What is considered an SAE under this mandatory procedure?  
Any unexpected grade 4  event not including routinely experienced events per protocol (e.g. 
myelosuppression) an d all grade 5 events  (death during protocol intervention) should be 
reported. The patient is considered “on -treatment” as defined in the protocol, which can extend 
days/weeks/months past the last date of actual protocol intervention.

Table 1: Summary of STRC Reporting Requirements for Institutional Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], Phase 1, Phase [ADDRESS_623534] be specified in the text of 
the approved protocol.  
 
STRC notification responsibilitie s of the person handling the reporting/documenting of the 
SAE:  
1. Make a phone call to the appropriate clinical member of the STRC as listed below (page if 
necessary) —see note [ADDRESS_623535] knowledge of the  event. 
This form is found at either the ORIS main menu page or by [CONTACT_399351]://ccc.wfubmc.edu/oris/strc.aspx . 
This will ensure that all persons that the event  applies to will be notified; remember to  file a 
copy of your confirmation. (Form instructions will walk you through the required fields, 
consult the help page for further instructions.)  
3. Ensure that you document that the appropriate persons on the STRC has been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
4. Follow up with/update th e clinical member of STRC regarding any new developments or 
information obtained during the course of the SAE investigation and reporting process.  
 
Elements needed to complete the electronic STRC form:  
1. ORIS Patient ID (PID)  
2. Name [CONTACT_485238]/ Date/Time/Comments.  
3. Grade of event.  
4. Is this related to protocol intervention or treatment?  
5. Is suspension of the protocol needed?  
6. Is any change to consent or protocol needed?  
CCCWFU [ADDRESS_623536] Carcinoma  
 
24 
 7. Was the nature or severity of the event unexpected?  
8. Date of the event.  
9. Brief description of the event using approved CTC version terminology.  
10.  Date of last study dose before event.  
11. Relevant tests/labs.  
12. Most importantly make sure that the Investigator assigns attribution to the reported 
 event (grade) using the appropriate CTCAE ver sion for the protocol.  
 
The Clinical Members of STRC to Notify by [CONTACT_399352]:  
 
Bayard Powell, MD  – Director -at-Large, CCCWFU; Chair, PRC; Section Head,  
Glenn Lesser, MD – Hematology Oncology  
Kathryn Greven, MD  – Vice Chair –  
Marissa Howard -McNatt, MD  – General Surgery  
 
Definition of Unavailable:  As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contact[CONTACT_485233] a reasonable amount of time, then initiate contact [CONTACT_485234].  Give the back -up a reas onable amount of time to respond to a phone call or page 
before contact[CONTACT_485235]. This is a general guideline.  You must use your best 
judgment as a clinical research professional given the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other 
circumstances  as to when it is appropriate to contact [CONTACT_380247].  If the event occurs near 
the end of day, then leave messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting 
your STRC notification form.  The important criteria is that have taken re asonable steps to notify 
and document that you have initiated some type of contact [CONTACT_485236].

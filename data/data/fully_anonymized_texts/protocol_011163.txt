Protocol: A Randomized Trial of Behavioral Nudges to Improve Enrollment in Critical Care Trials  
[ADDRESS_190588]  
Difficulty recruiting patients is a widely recognized barrier to successful completion of  randomized 
controlled trials  (RCTs)  and a significant contributor to the cost of conducting such studies . Difficulty 
recruiting patients is particularly problematic for critical care trials which often rely on surrogate 
decision makers (SDMs) for enrollment decisions. Evidence suggests that behavioral interventions, or nudges, may offer novel approaches to increase enrollment in RCTs by [CONTACT_164251]. We aim to determine the effectiveness of a scalable bundle of non-monetary nudges on increasing enrollment rates in a sham RCT among critically ill patients.  
2. Background and Introduction 
 
The joint problems of under -enrollment and selective enrollment in RCTs have long plagued efforts 
to evaluate new and existing medical interventions1-4. Under-enrollment occurs when too few research 
participants are enrolled to provide adequate statistical power to answer the study’s primary research question, degrading the study’s scientific value and hence, ethics
5-7. Selective enrollment occurs when 
specific subgroups within the target population are enrolled in proportions greater o r less than their 
representation in that population, limiting the generalizability of the trial’s results and curtailing 
scientific value8. 
 
Forty  percent of National Cancer Institute-sponsored  trials are never completed, according to an 
Institute of Medicine report9. Studies often go unfinished due to  enrollment difficulties5,10- 12. Trials that 
fail to achieve target enrollment due to enrollment difficulties have been called the “ultimate 
inefficiency”9. Recruitment has been referred to as “the most difficult and challenging aspect of clinical 
trials13. Even when investigators enroll an adequate number of participants, they rarely do so on 
schedule12,14, or in a manner that attracts the full range of available  participants8,15. Further, participant 
recruitment represents one of the most substantial  costs of conducting clinical trials, requiring an 
average of 13 hours and $[ADDRESS_190589] .

[ADDRESS_190590] inducement.  
3.2 Primary Outcome Variable(s)  
This randomized trial has the single primary outcome of  proportion of SDMs who enroll the patient 
into the sham RCT.  
3.3 Secondary Outcome Variable(s)  
 Secondary outcomes included undue inducement,  unjust inducement, patient and surrogate 
characteristics associated with enrollment. Undue inducement was defined as an interaction between intervention and risk percept ion on enrollment rate.  Unjust inducement was defined as an interaction 
between intervention and highest level of education completed on enrollment rate.    
4. Design  
 This is a single -blinded randomized controlled among surrogates of patients requiring mecha nical 
ventilation admitted to one of ten ICUs across two University of Pennsylvania Health System  (UPHS) 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
5. Recruitment  
5.[ADDRESS_190591] the attending physician for any identified patient to confirm eligibility and seek approval for the study team to approach the patient’s family. The coordinator will approach approved families if they are present in the patient’s room at the time of recruitment. The coordinator may defer 
approach if there is a procedure underway or if the family is in visible distress.  
The eligibility criteria for participation are as follows:     
Eligibility Criteria  
ICU length of stay >24hrs  
Mechanically ventilated via an endotracheal tube  
Protocol: A Randomized Trial of Behavioral Nudges to Improve Enrollment in Critical Care Trials  
[ADDRESS_190592] 24 more hours  
No limitations on life extending care  
Surrogate fluent in English  
Not en rolled in an active ICU trial  
Patient unable to consent for self  
ICU attending is not a study investigator  
ICU attending identifies the patient’s family as distrustful of the medical system  
ICU attending declines approach for any reason (reason to be documented)  
Surrogate present in patient’s room  
 
5.[ADDRESS_190593] this study in all 6 ICUs located at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164249] 4 ICUs located at Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307]. Using an estimated baseline enrollment  rate of 30% in the 
control group, a total of [ADDRESS_190594] 80% power to detect a 20% absolute 
difference at alpha of 0.05. We will consecutively recruit all eligible surrogates  from the ICU  until we 
reach our target sample size. We will attempt visit each ICU  session  at least once a day . The research 
coordinator  will approach eligible surrogates  while they are present in the patient’s room. For 
surrogates who initially  defer a decision we will attempt to reengage the following day and each 
subsequent recruiting day until we either have a definitive decision or until the patient is ineligible. We 
anticipate that we can recruit at least [ADDRESS_190595] be met, are:  
1. Patient and surrogate m ust be 18 or older 
2. ICU length of stay > 24 hours  
3. Mechanically ventilated via an oral endotracheal tube  
4. Patient is unable to consent for themselves  
5.5 Key Exclusion Criteria  
Patients will be excluded if one of the following criteria is met: 
1. Limitations on life extending care  
2. Anticipated extubation or tracheostomy placement in next 24 hours  
3. Enrolled in another ICU trial  
4. ICU attending is a study investigator 
Surrogates will be excluded if one of the following criteria are met: 
1. Not fluent in English  
2. Identified by [CONTACT_164252]: A Randomized Trial of Behavioral Nudges to Improve Enrollment in Critical Care Trials  
7 
 3. Not present in the patient’s room at the time of recruitment  
 
5.[ADDRESS_190596] informed consent procedures. The two groups 
only differ  in the initial approach, whether they are asked to complete a survey before being informed 
of the sham trial or whether they are invited to consider the sham trial without a pre -consent survey.  
Both  groups then fill out identical risk assessments and demographic surveys . After indicating their sham 
trial enrollment decision and completing risk assessments and demographic surveys, surrogates  will be 
debriefed (see debriefing script).  
 
6.2 Assignment  
 
Group allocation will be determined by [CONTACT_164253] 50% to each group stratified by [CONTACT_164254].  
 
7. Procedures  
Study procedures are  as following:  
1.  The research coordinator  will review the electronic medical record of patients a dmitted to each 
of [ADDRESS_190597] the ICU attending of patients screened as eligible to confirm eligibility.   
3.  The research coordinator will visit each eligible patient’s room to assess for the presence of 
visitors.   
4.  If visitors are present the research coordinator will enter patient information into the REDCap 
study module on the screening tablet.  
5.  The res earch coordinator will enter the room, identify themselves and confirm that the visitor is 
the patient’s surrogate decision maker.  
6.  The research coordinator will ask the patient’s identified surrogate decision maker if they are willing to hear about a research study.  
7.  Surrogate decision makers who indicate their wiliness to hear about a research study will then be randomized in the REDCap randomization module (as above).  
8.  If the participant is randomized to the intervention arm the research coordi nator will follow the 
script (see below) introducing the survey. Following completion of the survey the research coordinator will then ask if they are willing to hear about a research trial.  
9.  If the participant is randomized to the control arm the rese arch coordinator will follow the script 
(see below) introducing the sham mechanical ventilation weaning trial.  
Protocol: A Randomized Trial of Behavioral Nudges to Improve Enrollment in Critical Care Trials

 10.  After the surrogate makes an enrollment decision (regardless of the decision) for the sham 
mechanical ventilation trial they will be asked to complete the risk perception assessment and 
demographic surveys.  
11.  If the surrogate askes for more time to make an enrollment decision the research coordinator 
will ask for a good time to return for a decision. Risk perception assessment and demogra phic 
survey data will be deferred until after a decision is made. The research coordinator will follow up the following day (or time set by [CONTACT_58850]) to seek an enrollment decision. Repeated 
attempts to obtain an enrollment decision will continue each recruitment day until a decision is 
made or until eligibility criteria is no longer met.  
12. Immediately following the sham trial enrollment decision, risk assessment and demographic 
surveys the research coordinator will debrief the surrogate (see script below).  
13.  The research coordinator will update the screening database with the results of the recruitment 
attempt.  
14.  The research coordinator  will document  additional clinical data from the electronic medical 
record for participating patients  into the REDCap study database .  
15.  We will continue subject recruitment until target enrollment is reached.  
8. Consent  
A waiver of informed consent has been approved by [CONTACT_160556]. Once patients have been chart screened for eligibility, study personnel will approach 
potentially eligible surrogate. Study personnel will introduce themselves to the patient, inform the patient that they are part of a group conducting a research study, and ask permission to sit down and 
tell the patient more. Following the study procedures and debriefing the participant will retain the 
debriefing handout which includes instructions on how to withdrawal from the study.  
9. Analysis Plan 
As we do not have any strong a priori evidence that any of the collected demographic will be 
strongly associated with the primary outcome, we will perform an unadjusted analysis as the primary 
analysis. The primary outcome will be an intention-to -treat analysis of the proportion of participants 
who enroll in the s ham clinical trial.  The intervention arm will be compared to the control arm using a 
chi-square test.  In secondary analyses, we will test for undue inducement by [CONTACT_164255] . We will test for unjust inducement by 
[CONTACT_164256].  Stata v14 will 
be used for all analyses. Unless otherwise specified, a p-value <0.[ADDRESS_190598] enrollment 
decisions. The number  of included variables in the final model will be determined by [CONTACT_19223] (enrollments into the sham trial) to not exceed a 1:10 covariate to event ratio.  
10. Confidentiality of Subjects and Data  
10.1 Data Management  
 
Protocol: A Randomized Trial of Behavioral Nudges to Improve Enrollment in Critical Care Trials  
9 
 Prudent steps will be taken to ensure that all information will be kept confidential and secure, 
including medical and survey data. All survey data will be collected on-site by [CONTACT_164257]/staff 
and entered into REDCap (Resea rch Electronic Data Capture), hosted at the University of Pennsylvania. 
We will implement multiple, redundant protective measures to guarantee the security of participant 
data. All data for this project will be stored on UPHS secure/firewalled servers. The se data servers are 
maintained in a guarded facility behind several locked doors, with very limited physical access rights. 
They are also cyber -protected by [CONTACT_164258]. This multi -layer system of data security, identical to the 
system protecting the University of Pennsylvania Health Systems medical records, greatly minimizes privacy risks. Direct identifiers for patients and their surrogates will be omitted from all analytic files.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_190599] access to the data. All study data will be stored behind 
firewalls on UPHS  servers; none will be stored on stand-alone PCs or laptops. All study personnel who 
work with these data will have undergone required human subjects training. We will implement multiple, redundant protective measures to guarantee the privacy and security of the participant data. All data for this project will be stored on the secure/ firewalled servers of the  UPHS  in data files that will 
be protected by [CONTACT_164259]. These data servers are maintained in a guarded facility behind several locked doors, with very limited physical access rights. They are also cyber -protected by [CONTACT_164260]. Electronic access rights are carefully controlled by [CONTACT_111544].  
10.[ADDRESS_190600] Privacy  
We will appro ach surrogates in the patient’s room. We will offer them the option to speak in the 
patient’ s room or in an alternative private location.  Individual -level medical data for patients will be 
kept confidential and will only be stored on highly secure servers  available for patient -level data. Only 
authorized project personnel will have access to the data and the data will be stored on servers only and 
not stand -alone PCs or laptop s. All study personnel who work with this medical data will have 
undergone all of  the required human subjects training.

 11.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
Participants will be offered enrollment in a sham  randomized controlled trial  comparing the effects 
of prioritizing decreases in FiO2 vs PEEP in weaning of mechanical ventilation. Thus, temporarily deceiving patients on the purpose of the study. Importantly, the risk is minimal because: (1) their participation in the main study and decision whether or not to participate in the s ham RCT will not affect 
the treatm ent their loved one receives; (2) the proposed intervention in the s ham  RCT is within standard 
of care for mechanically ventilated patients and is minimally invasive, so discussion about this s ham RCT 
and intervention is not expected to lead to additional distress for the participant; (3) the evidence to date suggests that the behavioral nudges employed in this study are without ethical concerns  (4) we offer participants the opportunity to opt-out after a thorough debriefing procedure. Difficulty recruitin g 
patients is a widely recognized barrier to successful completion of clinical trials and a significant contributor to the cost of conducting such studies. If a simple intervention such as the behavioral economic nudges we are testing are found to increase trial recruitment without blunting perception of risk it could have a dramatic effect on future critical care trials.

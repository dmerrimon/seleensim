and update/correct all other sections of your IRB application as applicable. 
***IMPORTANT*** Before leaving this page to update other sections of your application, be sure to SAVE this section first.
1. Status of the Research
Check the statement(s) that best describe(s) the current status of your research: 
No subjects have enrolled to date.
Recruitment and/or enrollment of new subjects or review of records/specimens continue.
Study is closed to enrollment, but subjects still receive research-related interventions (e.g., treatment, blood draws).
Study enrollment is permanently closed; subjects have completed all research-related interventions; and the study remains active
only for long-term follow-up of subjects (see Tool Tip above for info on long-term follow-up of subjects).*
Research has progressed to the point that it involves 1) Data analysis, including analysis of identifiable private information or
identifiable biospecimens; and/or 2) Accessing follow-up clinical data from procedures that subjects would undergo as part of clinical
care.*
The remaining research activities are limited only to data analysis. There is access to records or specimens either directly or
through codes or links to the data.*
The remaining research activities are limited only to data analysis. There is no subject/record/specimen identifying codes or links to
the data; the researcher or research team cannot readily ascertain the subject's identity.*
All study activities are complete. IRB approval can be inactivated.
*Possibility that review will move from Full to Expedited.
2. If subjects have been enrolled within the last year, and the IRB approved a consent/assent form for your study:
Please attach a complete, signed copy for the last two subjects enrolled with each  consent/assent form/HIPAA form since the last

4. Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others/Adverse Events Summary & Assessment
Did any problems/adverse events occur during the last 12 months?
Yes No
In the space below, provide a written summary of both unanticipated problems* and available information regarding adverse events
since the last review (e.g., initial review or annual/continuing review). The amount of detail provided in such a summary will vary
depending on the type of research being conducted; in many cases, such a summary could be a brief statement that there have been
no unanticipated problems and that adverse events have occurred at the expected frequency and level of severity as documented in the
research protocol, the informed consent document, and investigator’s brochure (if applicable). The summary must include the PI’s
assessment whether the problems/adverse events warrant changes to the protocol, consent process, or risk/benefit ratio.
Note: It is the IRB's expectation that all unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others or related deaths requiring prompt
reporting are submitted in the appropriate time frame (See Policy [ PDF]). Your response to this Annual/Continuing Review is
considered assurance that all prompt reportable problems/adverse events have been submitted for IRB review.
We have recorded one adverse event in the past 12 months that has not been reported to the IRB. This
information has been included in the attached progress report as well as submitted as a separate AE and
deviation submission to go along with this CR.
*For multisite studies, the written summary should describe external events determined to be unanticipated problems involving risk to
subjects or others.

Consent/Assent Tips:
If you have multiple consent documents, be sure to upload each individually (not all in a combined file).
If another site is serving as the IRB for the project, attach the form as a “Reliance Consent Form” so the document will not receive
a [LOCATION_006] IRB approval stamp; the reviewing IRB will need to stamp the consent forms.
Changes to consent documents (e.g., informed consent form, assent form, cover letter, etc...) should be reflected in a 'tracked
changes' version and uploaded separately with the Document Type "Highlighted Changes".
It is very important that only the documents you wish to have approved by [CONTACT_41896]; DELETE OUTDATED FILES --
previously approved  versions will still be available in Protocol History.
Attachments that are assigned a Document Type to which an IRB approval stamp applies will be considered the version(s) to be

How to Get the Section Check Mark
1. You must:
a) provide a response in the text box below describing how investigators will obtain consent/assent, and 
b) check the box for at least one of the consent items and/or check mark one of the waivers

Informed Consent Process:
Using active voice, describe how investigators will obtain consent/assent. Include:
Section 7 Page 1 of 343499
the circumstances under which consent will be sought and obtained
the timing of the consent process (including any waiting period between providing information and obtaining consent)
who will seek consent
how you will minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence
the method used for documenting consent
if applicable, who is authorized to provide permission or consent on behalf of the subject
if applicable, specific instruments or techniques to assess and confirm potential subjects’ understanding of the information
Note: all individuals authorized to obtain informed consent should be designated as such in the E-IRB "Study Personnel" section of
this application.
Special considerations may include:
Obtaining consent/assent for special populations such as children, prisoners, or people with impaired decisional capacity
Research Involving Emancipated Individuals  
If you plan to enroll some or all prospective subjects as emancipated, consult with [LOCATION_006] legal counsel prior to submitting this
application to the IRB . Include research legal counsel’s recommendations in the "Additional Information" section as a separate
document.
Research Involving Non-English Speaking Subjects  
For information on inclusion of non-English speaking subjects, or subjects from a foreign culture, see IRB Application Instructions
for Recruiting Non-English Speaking Participants or Participants from a Foreign Culture.
Research Repositories  
If the purpose of this submission is to establish a research repository describe the informed consent process. For guidance
regarding consent issues, process approaches, and sample language see the Sample Repository/Registry/Bank Consent
Template .
Informed consent will be obtained written and orally. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_219208] A will obtain consent from the
subjects and payment will not be made available at this time to ensure consent will be obtained solely on voluntary basis. The method
of documentation includes a written form including the eight federally required elements. Informed consent will be read orally to the
subject and will be made available for the subject to read. Written consent will be obtained prior to any procedures being performed
on each subject including massage and the biopsy.
All subjects will be given contact [CONTACT_219221]. Questions can be directed to the principal
investigator, [CONTACT_219249]-Versteegden, who will be in contact [CONTACT_219222]. Should a complaint
arise, subjects will be asked to provide a written account of the complaint while the researchers will also provide their own account of
the situation. All complaints will be collected, reported, and hand delivered to the IRB and ORI.
Request for Waiver of Informed Consent Process
If you are requesting IRB approval to waive the requirement for the informed consent process, or to alter some or all of the
elements of informed consent, complete, Section 1 and Section 2 below.
Note: The IRB does not approve waiver or alteration of the consent process for greater than minimal risk research, except
for planned emergency/acute care research as provided under FDA regulations. Contact [CONTACT_41897] ([PHONE_728]).
SECTION 1.
Check the appropriate item:
I am requesting a waiver of the requirement for the informed consent process.
I am requesting an alteration of the informed consent process.
If you checked the box for this item, describe which elements of consent will be altered and/or omitted, and justify the
alteration.
SECTION 2.
Explain how each condition applies to your research.
a) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subject.
b) The rights and welfare of subjects will not be adversely affected.
c) The research could not practicably be carried out without the requested waiver or alteration.
d) Whenever possible, the subjects or legally authorized representatives will be provided with additional pertinent information
after they have participated in the study.
Section [ADDRESS_263437] fit into one of three regulatory options :
1. The only record linking the participant and the research would be the consent document, and the principal risk would be
potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality (e.g., a study that involves participants who use illegal drugs).
2. The research presents no more than minimal risk to the participant and involves no procedures for which written consent
is normally required outside of the research context (e.g., a cover letter on a survey, or a phone script).
3. The participant (or legally authorized representative) is a member of a distinct cultural group or community in which
signing forms is not the norm, the research presents no more than minimal risk to the subject, and there is an appropriate
alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.
Select the option below that best fits your study. 
If the IRB approves a waiver of signatures, participants must still be provided oral or written information about the study.
To ensure you include required elements in your consent document, use the Cover Letter Template  as a guide. There is
an English  and a Spanish  version.
 
Option 1
Describe how your study meets these criteria:
a) The only record linking the participant and the research would be the consent document:
b) The principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality (i.e., a study that involves subjects
who use illegal drugs).
Under this option, each participant (or legally authorized representative) must be asked whether (s)he wants to sign a
consent document; if the participant agrees to sign a consent document, only an IRB approved version should be
used.
Option 2
Describe how your study meets these criteria:
a) The research presents no more than minimal risk to the participant:
b) Involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context (i.e. a cover
letter on a survey, or a phone script):
Option 3
Describe how your study meets these criteria:
a) The subject (or legally authorized representative) is a member of a distinct cultural group or community in which
signing forms is not the norm.
b) The research presents no more than minimal risk to the subject.
c) There is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.

You may attach a sponsor’s protocol pages in the “Additional Information” section and refer to them where necessary in
the Research Description. However, each prompt that applies to your study should contain at least a summary paragraph.
Pro Tips:
Save your work often to avoid losing data.
Use one of the attachment buttons in this section or under the Additional Information section to include supplemental
information with your application. During the document upload process, you will be able to provide a brief description
of the attachment.
Background
Include a brief review of existing literature in the area of your research. You should identify gaps in knowledge that should be addressed
and explain how your research will address those gaps or contribute to existing knowledge in this area. For interventional research,
search PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov for duplicative ongoing and completed trials with same condition and intervention(s).
Massage is considered a manipulative and body-based therapy in complementary and integrative medicine (CIM). With about [ADDRESS_263474] widely used form of CIM in the U.S.1 It is defined as “a
mechanical manipulation of body tissues with rhythmical pressure and stroking for the purpose of promoting health and well-being.”[ADDRESS_263475] common.3 The proposed benefits of massage, as stated by [CONTACT_219223] (AMTA), are relief of muscle tension and stiffness, faster healing of strained muscles and sprained ligaments, reduced
muscle pain, swelling and spasm, greater joint flexibility and range of motion, and even enhanced athletic performance.[ADDRESS_263476] an influence on immune function, depression, relaxation/sleep, and overall quality of life.4-[ADDRESS_263477], or any other types of disuse cause atrophy and several other effects in muscle tissue. Due to the impaired
muscle function associated with atrophy9, it is vital, clinically, to find interventions that attenuate or even possibly reverse muscle
atrophy that is commonly caused by [CONTACT_219224]. It would be ideal to find interventions that patients who are not able to exercise, such as
those in the intensive care unit (ICU), can receive to help maintain their skeletal muscle integrity and function.
Our preliminary data on rats have shown that massage has an anabolic effect in growth-perturbed muscles. Massage enhanced protein
synthesis and muscle size in animals undergoing regrowth after atrophy. Also, massage applied during a period of disuse-induced
atrophy attenuated muscle loss and reversed the level of protein synthesis to normal. However, unperturbed muscle did not show this
growth-promoting effect. These results indicate that massage could serve as an intervention for the loss of muscle during atrophy and
aid in regrowth. However, studies in humans have not been performed yet.
The unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) method has been recently developed to mimic the 0-g conditions in space and assist in
assessing the efficacy of interventions to combat muscle atrophy and facilitating in-vivo muscle performance studies.[ADDRESS_263478] as muscle tissue responds to loading, muscle responds to unloading as
well. Unloading a muscle can result in muscle atrophy at a weekly rate of about 2.5% particularly for knee extensors.10 Short term
ULLS (10-16 days) doesn’t seem to result in large macroscopic changes in muscle size or CSA but individual muscle fiber size has
been shown to decrease at a weekly rate that varies between 3-8% across different studies.[ADDRESS_263479]. We hypothesize that 15 min of massage
with a 35 N load for 4 days will not induce muscle damage but will still cause an increase of satellite cells, extracellular vesicles, as well
as in cross sectional area and protein synthesis.
Study Design
Describe and explain the study design (e.g., observational, secondary analysis, single/double blind, parallel, crossover, deception, etc.).
Clinical Research : Indicate whether subjects will be randomized and whether subjects will receive any placebo.
Community-Based Participatory Research : If you are conducting community-based participatory research (CBPR) , describe
strategies for involvement of community members in the design and implementation of the study, and dissemination of results from
the study.
Qualitative research : Indicate ranges where flexibility is needed, if a fixed interview transcript is not available, describe interview
topi[INVESTIGATOR_41866].
Research Repositories : If the purpose of this submission is to establish a Research Repository (bank, registry) and the material
you plan to collect is already available from a commercial supplier, clinical lab, or established IRB approved research repository,
provide scientific justification for establishing an additional repository collecting duplicate material. Describe the repository design
and operating procedures. For relevant information to include, see the [LOCATION_006] Research Biospecimen Bank Guidance  or the [LOCATION_006]
Research Registry Guidance .
This study is designed as a randomized control trial. Figure 1 shows the time line for the study. There will be four groups of subjects,
(1) normal weight-bearing with massage (WB-M), (2) normal weight bearing without massage (WB-C) (3) ULLS, no massage (control,
U-C), and (4) ULLS with massage (U-M). We expect to recruit 140 subjects to in order in fully enroll 128 (32 per group, n = 3 per group
for attrition). For measurement of protein synthesis, participants will ingest three 50 mL doses of heavy water (2H2O) for the first two
days and the dose will decrease to two 50 mL doses per day (a total of [ADDRESS_263480] over the course of
the trial). 3-[ADDRESS_263481] their left leg immobilized and suspended using a hinged knee brace. Those immobilized will be required to wear the
brace and use crutches at all times, except while showering and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Immobilization will begin on day 2 and will continue until the
end of the study (day 9). Members of the research team will use a custom-made device to massage the quadriceps region of subjects’
left leg and leave the right leg unaffected in the WB-M and U-M groups. Massage treatments will begin on day [ADDRESS_263482]
every other day (day 5, 7, 9) until the end of the study. A baseline muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis will be taken from the right leg
on day 2, prior to the first massage. Muscle biopsies will then be taken from both legs 4-[ADDRESS_263483] massage on day 9, and
the muscle tissue will be frozen for further examination. (See Figure 1). Sham treatment for the WB-C and U-C groups will include us
touching the skin using a light brushing technique.
For the weight bearing groups as comparison groups,they will also have to drink deuterium oxide heavy water over [ADDRESS_263484] two biopsies taken (day 2- right leg, and day 9- left massaged
leg). This will still allow for effective comparison between groups and will reduce burden on these participants. We will enroll the weight
bearing groups after immobilization groups to ensure that those interested in the study will not drop out after possible randomization
into the immobilization group.

Cyclic Compressive Loading (CCL) Device Reliability and Validity Testing:
Forty participants will be requested to participate in pi[INVESTIGATOR_219210]. This testing will be used to validate the equipment.
Two different clinicians will massage all participants for [ADDRESS_263486] reliability. The
same inclusion and exclusion criteria for the participants will be used as in the original study.
Medical Health Questionnaire:
Potential subjects will be verbally screened to see if they are eligible for this study.
Heavy Water:
Deuterium oxide heavy water (2H2O) is a stable, non-radioactive isotope that is indistinguishable from normal water. It is simply water
that has a higher amount of a natural, but less abundant, form of hydrogen. Subjects will be required to ingest the heavy water for 9
days. (99% D2O, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). A target of 1-2% enrichment is achieved during a one week priming stage and
maintained for the remainder of the study. Subjects will be sent home with [ADDRESS_263487]
two days, they will consume one 50 mL vial of the heavy water three times a day (150mL/day). The next 7 days, they will consume one
50 mL vial twice a day (100mL/day). This will total 1000mL of water per subject. Over the course of the 9 day trial, the subjects’ blood
will be drawn on day 2, 5, 7, and 9. 
Blood Draws:
Blood samples will be obtained for protein synthesis measures and for the assessment of exosomes and circulating miRNAs. Left
over blood will be stored in the lab indefinitely. Approximately 5-25 ml will be drawn.
Immobilization: 
Participants of the immobilization/massage and immobilization/no massage groups will be placed in a knee immobilizer on their left leg
and crutches, and will be non-weight-bearing starting on day 2 (after the first two days of heavy water intake) of the 9 day trial for a total
of 7 days. The participants will be required to log and explain on the attached Immobilization Time Log any time they did not use/wear
the crutches or knee immobilizer in order to track compliance. 
Massage: 
Subjects will report to the Human Performance Lab, in room B04A of the Multidisciplinary Science building. A custom-made cyclic
compressive loading (CCL) device will be used to apply a mechanical load to the left thigh starting on day 3. The knee immobilizer will
be removed, and the subjects will be positioned right lateral recumbent with their left hip and leg slightly flexed and the left leg
supported by a wedge to maintain anatomical position in the frontal plane. The CCL device will be a commercially available massage
roller instrumented with a strain gage to measure applied load. Massage application using a 35 newton load will be applied for 15
minutes every other day over the course of 7 days (days 3, 5, 7, and 9). The CCL device will be placed 10cm proximal to the superior
pole of the patella over the vastus lateralis muscle of the left leg, and a normal force of 35N will be applied while rolling the device
proximally along the length of the vastus lateralis at a rate equal to one muscle length over 2 seconds. Without interruption, the
direction of the massage will then be reversed and the same load and loading rate will be applied proximal to distal. Thus, one
complete cycle of massage to the vastus lateralis will take 4 seconds, corresponding to a duty cycle of 0.25Hz. Massage will continue
for 15 minutes, resulting in approximately 225 complete cycles. Sham treatment (WB-C and U-C) groups will receive a light touching
on the skin using a light brushing technique. 
We have previously shown that the beneficial effects of massage can be optimized by [CONTACT_219228]12, including
considerations for timing of massage application13, duration of massage14 and the magnitude of applied load.5,[ADDRESS_263488] determined that the optimal load for human vastus lateralis is a normal force of 35N.
Muscle Biopsies:
On day 2 of the study (after the first two days of heavy water intake), a baseline muscle biopsy will be taken from the vastus lateralis
muscle of the right leg. Subjects will be instructed not to eat or drink anything for breakfast the last day of the study when they come in
for the last massage and the biopsies. Subjects will be provided a light breakfast consisting of a choice of bagel with cream cheese or
Section [ADDRESS_263489] bout of massage one muscle biopsy will be taken from the
left and the right vastus lateralis each. Biopsies (100-300 mg tissue) will be taken by [CONTACT_219229]. The tissue will be frozen for analysis by [CONTACT_219230]. In exercise literature a waiting
period of about 2-[ADDRESS_263490] the subjects’ time, a waiting period of 4-6 hours was decided. The subjects are allowed to walk
around after the massaging, but are asked to refrain from exercising for the 4 hours in between the massage treatment and the muscle
biopsy.
Muscle Biopsy Procedure: 
A muscle biopsy sample will be obtained from the vastus lateralis. The biopsy procedure will proceed as follows for each subject
taking approximately 45 minutes. Subjects will report to the procedural room located in the Center for Clinical and Translational
Science (CCTS). Subjects will lie down and have a 1 inch by 1 inch portion of hair removed with a disposable razor on the outer
surface of the thigh as necessary. The site will then be cleaned with alcohol followed by [CONTACT_219231]. A local anesthetic
(1% Xylocaine HCl, 3cc) will be used to numb an area the size of a quarter on the site of the outer thigh over the vastus lateralis muscle
approximately a hand width above the knee using a 23-gauge, [ADDRESS_263491]
for numbness before the procedure proceeds. In our experience, 5 minutes is adequate to sufficiently numb the area for the biopsy
procedure. A ¼ inch wide incision will be made through the skin in the center of the anesthetized area with a sterile, single-use, #11
disposable scalpel. The incision needs to perforate the fascia of the vastus lateralis muscle sufficiently to allow for subsequent entry
of the biopsy needle. The depth of the incision will be adjusted to accommodate estimated subcutaneous fat depth. A sterile 5 mm
Berkstrom biopsy needle (Pelomi Industries, Denmark) will be passed through the ¼ inch incision into the muscle and a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]
(the size of a pencil eraser, equal to ~ 100-300 mg) of muscle will be removed. The angle of entry for the biopsy will be medial to
lateral. The biopsy team will use the suction biopsy technique, whereby a small amount of suction with a Monoject 60cc syringe
attached via sterile tubing to the end of the trocar will be applied to the needle prior to closing of the trocar, which enhances the
investigators’ ability to maximize the amount of muscle obtained. A conchotome may also be used to remove the muscle. Manual
pressure will be applied to the wound until bleeding stops. The muscle biopsy site will be cleaned with an alcohol preparation to clear
all betadine and standard procedures will be used to close the wound. The biopsied area will be covered with gauze and a pressure
wrap applied. The muscle tissue obtained will be divided into pi[INVESTIGATOR_219211].
COVID-19 testing: 
During the pandemic, participants will be required to have a negative COVID-[ADDRESS_263492] before undergoing any muscle biopsy until further

Potential Risks & Benefits
Risks
Describe any potential risks – including physical, psychological, social, legal, ability to re-identify subjects, or other risks. Assess
the seriousness and likelihood of each risk.
Which risks may affect a subject’s willingness to participate in the study?
Describe likely adverse effects of drugs, biologics, devices or procedures participants may encounter while in the study.
Qualitative research  - describe ethical issues that could arise while conducting research in the field and strategies you may use to
handle those situations.
Describe any steps to mitigate these risks.
Benefits
Describe potential direct benefits to study participants – including diagnostic or therapeutic, physical, psychological or emotional,
learning benefits. This cannot include incentives or payments.
State if there are no direct benefits.
Describe potential benefits to society and/or general knowledge to be gained.
Describe why potential benefits are reasonable in relation to potential risks. If applicable, justify why risks to vulnerable subjects are
reasonable to potential benefits.
There are some potential risks associated with the procedures presented in this protocol.
Muscle Biopsies: With the biopsy procedures, there is a risk of bleeding, bruising, pain, infection, and scarring of the skin. Bleeding
could rarely result in development of a hematoma. Pain and soreness usually resolves within 24-[ADDRESS_263493] indefinitely. An allergic reaction to the
anesthetic also may occur but is rarely seen.
Heavy Water (2H2O): The only side effect reported by [CONTACT_219232] (in rare subjects) a sensation of dizziness or vertigo soon after the first
dose. This is presumed to be due to a disequilibrium between H2O and 2H2O in the inner ear, and some subjects are sensitive to this.
This side effect, when it occurs, goes away and the initial dosing will occur in the CCTS where subjects are monitored. 
Blood Draws: With drawing blood, there is a risk of soreness, bruising, pain, infection, bleeding, and fainting. Any pain, bruising, or
soreness will usually resolve without any treatment. Any infection, bleeding, or fainting can be treated. 
Massage: The only side effect reported from massage is possible soreness during and/or after the session. It will go away with or
without treatment within 24-48 hours so treatment is not required.
Immobilization: With use of the knee brace there is a risk of chaffing, muscle atrophy of the immobilized leg, and muscle soreness of
the non-immobilized leg. It is important to note that all effects with use of the knee brace are reversible.
Participants will receive no personal benefit by [CONTACT_219233]. However, subjects are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_219212].
Available Alternative Opportunities/Treatments
Describe alternative treatments or opportunities that might be available to those who choose not to participate in the study, and which
offer the subject equal or greater advantages. If applicable, this should include a discussion of the current standard of care treatment(s).
Participation in this study is strictly voluntary. There are no other alternative treatments, procedures, or choices for the subjects except
for not to participate in the study.

Digital Data
Materials obtained in this study are for the primary purpose of research. Materials will include the muscle biopsy analysis. Muscle
biopsies will be stored in the laboratories of Drs. Dupont-Versteegden and Butterfield. For confidentiality and privacy, each subject will
be given a study identification number. All electronic data will be stored on an encrypted jump drive and any information will be
transferred on a password-protected computer. All hardcopy data will be locked in a filing cabinet found within a locked office located
within the College of Health Sciences offices. Only approved study personnel will have access to this locked office.
All data will be either stored in locked file cabinets, on secured password protected computer spreadsheets, within the investigator’s
laboratories (after the tissue has been de-identified). Each subject will be identified using only a study identification number and the
investigators of this study will keep private all research records that identify the subjects. The information obtained from this research
will be combined and presented in written materials, but these materials will not contain any subject identification. Only personnel
associated with this study will have access to the data and to keep information confined, all subject information will be kept under lock
and key.
All procedures proposed as part of this research protocol will be conducted or supervised by [CONTACT_219234]. For the muscle biopsy samples, appropriate technique and all usual precautions including sterilization to help avoid any risk
associated with these procedures will be taken. Patients will be asked to discontinue medications that may be associated with
excessive bleeding, including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_219213]-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for at least five days prior to the biopsy procedure. We
will recommend that patients remain active following the procedure which may mitigate against the pain and soreness/tightness post
procedure. Post-procedure analgesics will be provided if requested and if medically appropriate, but the individual will be responsible
for cost as outlined in “What happens if you get hurt or sick”. All participants will be given an instruction sheet for post-muscle biopsy
care with phone contact [CONTACT_15750] (Appendix G). The responsible study physician and an established method of contact [CONTACT_219235]. The research coordinator will follow up with the participant
day [ADDRESS_263494] be retained for a minimum of 6 years after study closure. Do
you confirm that you will retain all IRB-related records for a minimum of 6 years after study closure?

Payment
Describe the incentives (monetary or other) being offered to subjects for their participation. If monetary compensation is offered,
indicate the amount and describe the terms and schedule of payment. Please review this guidance  for more information on payments to
subjects, including restrictions and expectations.
Participants will receive compensation based on which group they are randomly assigned to. All participants will receive $15 for blood
draws and $50 per biopsy. Those assigned to the immobilization group will receive $100 for unloading. The participants will receive a
$65 bonus for completion of the study for a total of $375 if they are in the immobilization groups and $130-$[ADDRESS_263495] of services and/or tests that will not be paid for by [CONTACT_23638]/or the study (e.g., MRI, HIV). Keep in mind that a
subject will not know what is “standard” – and thus not covered by [CONTACT_456]/study – unless you tell them.
There will be no costs to the participants.
Data and Safety Monitoring
The IRB requires review and approval of data and safety monitoring plans for greater than minimal risk research or NIH-funded/FDA-
regulated clinical investigations.
If you are conducting greater than minimal risk research, or your clinical investigation is NIH-funded, describe your Data and Safety
Monitoring Plan (DSMP). Click here for additional guidance on developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan .
If this is a non-sponsored investigator-initiated protocol considered greater than minimal risk research, and if you are planning on
using a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) as part of your DSMP, click here for additional guidance  for information to
include with your IRB application.
Because this protocol involves muscle biopsy procedures, the study will be monitored by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).
The [LOCATION_006] CCTS has a standing DSMB and this established board will monitor this study for recruitment, adverse events, and
compliance, and report to the IRB every [ADDRESS_263496] spectrum of
Section 9 Page 7 of 1043499
institutional protocols and are familiar with the compliance requirements of federal agencies. The DSMB will review protocol
performance, regulatory requirements, particularly the reporting of adverse events, as well as documents necessary for IRB approval.
The DSMB can audit protocols when necessary and communicates directly with the IRB. 
Risk Assessment: A serious adverse event (AE) is defined as either fatal or life-threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219214], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is medically significant or requires
intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above. This study is greater than minimal risk.
Grading scale for AE intensity: 
Mild: Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity. 
Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity. 
Severe: Incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activity. 
Attribution scale for AE reporting: 
Probable: AE is related to the procedure (biopsies), including pain, bleeding, infection, and death, if death resulted from one of the
aforementioned complications. 
Possible: AE follows the biopsy within a reasonable period (within 7 days), but may have been produced by [CONTACT_1604].
Remote: AE does not follow the biopsy within a reasonable period (more than 7 days) and could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_219236]. 
Unrelated: AE is judged to be clearly due to extraneous causes and does not meet the above criteria.
Monitoring Plan Monitoring for adverse events will be conducted in real-time by [CONTACT_219237]. Risks
involved with this study are considered greater than minimal risk.
AE Reporting Serious AEs will be reported verbally to the IRB and CCTS within 24 hours and in writing within 48 hours of the event.
Unanticipated events will be reported to the CCTS in real time and to the IRB no later than 48 hours after the event. Annual reporting of
adverse events will be conducted with the IRB annual review/renewal according to their protocol. These reports will also be forwarded
to the CCTS. The CCTS Administration will be informed within [ADDRESS_263497]. Dupont-
Versteegden and her colleagues are capable of monitoring for safety objectively and without bias.

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 6 of 70  During the study treatment period, blood samples will be collected for safety analysis and for 
PK analysis of omadacycline.  Urine samples will be collected during the study period for 
safety, PK analysis, and microbiological analysis.  Safety assessments will include monitoring of adverse events (AEs),  concomitant medications,  clinical laboratory test results, vital sign 
measurements, pregnancy testing and physical examination findings.
 
Subjects will return to the clinical site for visits on Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, and for an End of 
Treatment (EOT) /Day [ADDRESS_157731] Therapy Evaluation (PTE) on Day 14 (+/- 2 days) after the subject’s first dose of test article.  A Final Follow -up assessment will be 
conducted within [ADDRESS_157732] or by [CONTACT_138829].  Otherwise, this assessment is to be performed with an in -person study visit.  During the Follow- up call/visit if the subject reports symptoms 
of potential recurrence, additional procedures will be performed.  
 
Rationale for Omadacycline Dose Regimen Selection:  
The dosing regimen of omadacycline selected for this study is based on the nonclinical and 
clinical experience to date, including in vitro antibacterial activity, PK characteristics, clinical efficacy  in prior studies, and the overall safety and tolerability profile.  Key considerations in 
dose selection are summarized below:
 
• While the driver of efficacy for omadacycline in UTI is not known, a pragmatic 
assumption was made that maximizing the time of urine concentration above 
pathogen MIC (ideally, throughout the dosing interval) would be desirable. 
• In PTK 0796- UUTI -[ZIP_CODE], omadacycline dosed as 300 mg po  every 12 hours 
(q12h) on Day 1 followed by 300 mg po daily for 5 days and 450 mg po q12h on Day 1 followed by 450 mg po daily for 5 days both demonstrated high urinary concentration s on Day 1 and Day 5.  For the 300 mg dosing group, over the 24 
hour dosing period, mean urinary concentrations ranged from 14 to 20 µg/mL on Day 1 and 17 to 30 µg/mL on Day 5.  For the 450 mg dosing group, over the 24 hour dosing period, mean urinary concentrations ranged from 11 to 25 µg/mL on Day 1 and 30 to 48 µg/mL on Day 5. 
• In PTK0796- UUTI -[ZIP_CODE], both the 300 mg and 450 mg omadacycline treatment 
groups had nausea reported in 60% of  subjects.  Vomiting occurred in 40% and 
20% of the 300 mg and 450 mg treatment groups, respectively.  In the recently completed PTK0796- ABSI -[ZIP_CODE] study which compared  omadacycline 450 mg 
po every 24 hours (q24h) for 2 doses followed by 300 mg po q24h for a total of 7  
to 14 days to linezolid 600 mg po every 12 hours for a total of 7 to 14 days, nausea and vomiting rates of 30.2% and 16.8% were observed.  In both studies, most events of nausea and vomiting occurred early in the treatment associated 
with the loading doses of omadacycline. 
• The effect  of a light meal administered approximately 1.5 hours before dosing 
was evaluated using the free base formulati on of omadacycline and resulted in 
approximately 20% decrease in exposure.  In the recently completed study 
Omadacycline   Paratek Pharmaceuticals, LLC 
PTK0796 -UUTI -[ZIP_CODE] -Version 3.0 FINAL; 18-FEB- 2019 IND # 75,928 IND # 73,[ADDRESS_157733] of a light meal administered approximately 1.5 
hours before dosing with the same formulation of omadacycline used in t he 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies was evaluated .  The results demonstrated an 
approximately 19% to  25% reduction in exposure when a light meal was 
administered 1.5 hours before dosing. 
• The Sponsor has decided to  add an omadacycline treatment group dosed at 450 
mg twice daily  for 7 days . The rationale for the change includes: 
1)    Since the driver of efficacy is unknown and the mean renal excretion of a 300 
mg oral dose is 14.4%,  a regimen that maximizes the tolerated dose of 
omadacycline may provide additional information on the dose necessary for clinical and microbiologic success in uUTI and allow comparison to the daily 
dosed omadacycline treatment groups. 
2) The proposed dosing of 450mg twice daily for 7 days will provide approximately 2x or greater the amount of omadacycline that is excreted into the urine compared to the daily omadacycline treatment groups.   
3) Blinded review of the first 145 subjects reveals good tolerability. Nausea has 
occurred in approximately 10% of all subjects with only a single subject 
(0.7%) reporting vomiting. There has been only one treatment discontinuation 
due to adverse events of nausea and/or vomiting reported. Therefore, even if all cases of nausea and vomiting were in a single omadacycline treatment group, nausea and vomiting appears lower than observed in  PTK0796- UUTI -
[ZIP_CODE] study. 
4) Dose -limiting transaminase increases were seen in Phase 1 studies at 600mg 
IV which is higher than the exposure at 450mg PO twice daily.  
5) Increases in heart rate following omadacycline are Cmax associated . Cmax 
concentrations with the 450mg PO dose (1077 ng/mL) at steady state are 
approximately one-half the Cmax concentration with the 100mg IV dose (2120 ng/mL) suggesting that heart rate increases above 12- [ADDRESS_157734] of a light meal, 
urinary concentrations should remain above the typi[INVESTIGATOR_138810]

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 8 of 70 Approximately 2 25 female subjects  will be enrolled at up to 25 sites.  Subjects will be 
randomized (1:1:1:1:1 ) to five treatment groups.  
Adaptive design:  
This is an adaptive dose-response finding study.  During the course of the study, a Bayesian 
analysis will be used to adaptively allocate new subjects to one of the treatment arms, conditional on the availability of primary efficacy endpoint data (investigator assessment of clinical response at PTE) .  When there is sufficient information available about the dose-
response, results from the Bayesian analysis will be reviewed by a DMC to determine if enrollment in any omadacycline treatment arms should be stopped or modified. Modifications to omadacycline dosing regimens/treatment arms may also be based on safety and tolerability.  
Bayesian analyses will be conducted after efficacy data (investigator assessment of clinical response at PTE) are available for approximately 40, 80, and 100 subjects in order to :  
• Determin e omadacycline dose group(s) that can be dropped from the trial, or  
• Modify the randomization ratios among the dose groups to improve the precision 
of the selected dose groups comparison of clinical success to the that of the 
nitrofurantoin group.   
 
Additional analyses may be carried out for the same two purposes.  Response criteria are targeted toward estimating the probability that the clinical success rate (proportion of subjects) for each dose group is within 10% of that of the nitrofurantoin group.  If at the analyses, that probability falls b elow 30% for a particular dose group, recruitment for that 
dose group may be stopped or curtailed.  If that probability exceeds 80% for a particular dose group, recruitment for that dose group may be increased to improve the precision of the estimate.

Enrollment of a total of ap proximately 225 subjects is planned.  The Bayesian posterior 
probability that the clinical success rate at the PTE Visit is within 0.10 of that of the 
nitrofurantoin group will be estimated for each omadacycline dose group.  The target 
probability is 0.80.  If the true underlying clinical succe ss rates for  the nitrofurantoin and 
omadacycline dose groups are 0.82, then the sample size of N=50 per treatment has 
approximately 79% power/ probability to yield the target probability (N=53  per treatment for 
80% power). T he sample size may be increased for a particular omadacycline dos ing group by 
[CONTACT_138832]/or droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a dose group to achieve improved power / 
probability of achieving the target probability that clinical success rates for a dose group  is 
within 0.10 of that of the nitrofurantoin group. If required to improve the precision of the 
interim or projected final analyses estimates of response rates or posterior probabilities, sample size may be increased to a maximum sample size provided in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP).  Subjects will be  randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to f ive treatment groups.

Uncomplicated Urinary tract infection (UTI) or acute cystitis is characterized by [CONTACT_138835], 
frequency and urgency with pyuria, and bacteriuria in a person without underlying urologic 
or renal abnormalities.  The burden of UTI is high in women; up to 60% of women have an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_138814] .1,2,3,4 Long- term morbidity is low; however, the 30 % to 40% 
recurrence rate is significant .1,2,5  Short- term morbidity has been described in female college 
students who experienced a mean of 6.1 symptomatic days and 2.4 days of restricted activity per epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].
1,3 Recieveing n o treatment or an ineffective treatment for an uUTI increases the 
duration of symptoms and can be complicated by [CONTACT_138836] 2.6% of women .
6,7  
Uncomplicated UTIs are predominately caused by E. coli (80% to 85%) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5% to 15%) with a small minority caused by 
[CONTACT_138837] , Proteus mirabilis , and other uropathogens .
1,6  Increasing rates of 
resistance among UTI pathogens to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, beta- lactams and 
fluoroquinolones, as well as, a recent safety warning to previously recommended first -line 
antibiotics (fluoroquinolone Food and Drud Adminstration  [FDA] safety alert and black box 
warnings ) has necessitated  reconsideration of antibiotic treatment recommendations. 
Fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin are now considered first- line agent s in the treatment of UTI. 
Resistance is generally low however emerging resistance has been observed in multi -drug 
resistant isolates. As a result, there is a need for new agents with efficacy against resistant 
uropathogens including extended- spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli .[ADDRESS_157759], omadacycline (formerly named PTK 0796), is the first member 
of the aminomethylcycline class of antibiotics, which are semi synthetic derivatives of the 
tetracycline class.  As a class, the tetracyclines have been in use for approximately [ADDRESS_157760] proven effective in the treatment of a variety of bacterial 
infections. Omadacycline is being developed for clinical use by [CONTACT_138838] (iv) and per oral  (po)  administration. The targeted indications include community- acquired bacterial 
pneumonia (CABP), acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), and UTI.  
Omadacycline has been evaluated in a global Phase 3 study comparing the safety and efficacy of iv and po omadacycline to iv and po linezolid in the treatment of adult subjects with ABSSSI (PTK0796 -ABSI -1108).  In addition, a global Phase 3 study has been 
conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of iv and po omadacycline compared to iv and po moxifloxacin in the treatment of adult subjects with CABP  (PTK0796- CABP -1200).  The 
latest [LOCATION_002] ( US)-only Phase 3 study compared the safety of po only omadacycline to 
po only linezolid in the treatment of adult subjects with ABSSSI (PTK0796- ABSI -[ZIP_CODE]).  
In all three studies, omadacycline was well -tolerated and demonstrated non- inferiority to its 
respective comparator.  Omadacycline (IV and PO) has recently been approved by [CONTACT_138839] .

minimum inhibitory concentrations for at least 90% of the common uUTI pathogens tested 
(MIC
90) for omadacycline are 0.5 µg/mL for S. saprophyticus , 2 µg/mL for ESBL-negative 
E. coli , and 2 µg/mL for ESBL-producing E. coli .9 
Study PTK0796- UUTI -[ZIP_CODE] was a randomized (1:1:1), open- label, parallel -desig ned 
Phase 1b study evaluating 3 dosing regimens of omadacycline in 31 female adults with cystitis. During the treatment period, serial blood and urine samples were collected for safety, microbiological, and pharmacokinetic ( PK) analyses of omadacycline. In  this study, t he PK 
of omadacycline in women with cystitis was found to be similar to the PK in healthy subjects. At steady -state, 10% to 13% of a po omadacycline dose is excreted in the urine, 
resulting in high urine concentrations. With the treatment reg imens studied, observed urine 
concentrations of omadacycline compared favorably with MIC values for common UTI pathogens, and a high percentage of subjects achieved clinical success and favorable microbiological responses. There was a higher than expected incidence of nausea and 
vomiting, which contrasts with the notably lower rates of nausea and vomiting observed in other omadacycline studies using comparable dosing regimens and active controls. The reason(s) for the increased incidences in nausea and vomi ting are difficult to ascertain given 
the open- label study design, small sample size, and lack of prior experience with 
omadacycline in the cystitis study population.  
This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of oral omadacycline as compared 
to oral  nitrofurantoin in the treatment of adult female subject s with cystitis . These data will 
be important to determine the potential utility of omadacycline for the treatment of UTI and 
will help in selection of dosing regimens that may be used in future UTI studies.  
It is expected that the dosing regimens evaluated in this study will provide urine concentrations of omadacycline that will exceed the MIC
90 for the common uncomplicated 
UTI pathogens (see dose selection discussion in Section 7.4 ). 
Please refer to the current version of the Investigator's Brochure10 for additional information 
on omadacycline.

follow-up.  All Screening evaluations should be completed  within the 24 hours prior to 
randomization.  Subjects who me et inclusion criteria, and do not meet exclusion criteria will 
be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 oral omadacycline dosing regimens or a twice-daily regimen 
of oral nitrofurantoin (see  Table 1  and Table  2).  Subjects should receive their first dose of 
test article at the site within 4  hours after randomization .  Treatment will be double-blinded 
and double- dummy (see Table 2 ). Please refer to  Section 9 of the protocol for further details 
on study phases and required assessments/procedures per phase.  
During the study treatment period, blood samples will be collected for safety analysis and for PK analysis of omadacycline.  Urine samples will be collect ed during the study period for 
safety , PK analysis, and microbiological  analysis.  Safety assessments will include 
monitoring of adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, clinical laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, pregnancy testing and physical examination findings. 
Subjects will return to the clinical site for visits on  Day  1, Day 3, Day 5, and for an End of 
Treatment (EOT) /Day [ADDRESS_157763] Therapy Evaluation (PTE) on Day 14 (+/- 2 days) 
after the subject’s first dose of test article.  A Final Follow -up assessment  will be conducted 
within [ADDRESS_157764] or by [CONTACT_138840].  Otherwise, this assessmen t is to be performed 
with an in -person study visit. During the Follow- up call/visit if the subject reports symptoms 
of potential recurrence, additional  procedures will be performed.   
See Appendix 1 for the full Schedule of Events. 
5.1.1 Adaptive Design 
This is an adaptive dose-response finding study. Initially, subjects will be  randomized 
(1:1:1:1:1 ) to five treatment groups. During the course of the study, a Bayesian analysis will 
be used to adaptively allocate new subjects to one of the treatment arms, conditional on the availability of primary efficacy endpoint data (investigator assessment of clinical response at PTE). When there is sufficient information available about the dose- response, results from 
the Bayesian analys is will be reviewed by a DMC to determine if enrollment in any

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 25 of 70 omadacycline treatment arms should be stopped or modified. Modifications to omadacycline 
dosing regimens/treatment arms may also be based on safety and tolerability. Bayesian analyses will be conducted after efficacy data (investigator assessment of clinical response at PTE) are available for approximately 40, 80, and 100 subjects in order to :  
1. Determine  omadacycline dose group(s) that can be dropped from the trial, or  
2. Modify the randomization ratios among the dose groups to improve the precision of the selected dose groups comparison of clinical success to that of the nitrofurantoin group.   
Additional analyses may be carried out for the same two purposes.  Response cri teria are 
targeted toward estimating the probability that the clinical success rate (proportion of subjects) for each omadacycline dose group is within 10% of that of the nitrofurantoin group.  If at the analyses, that probability falls below 30% for a particular dose group, recruitment for that dose group may be stopped or curtailed.  If that probability exceeds 80% for a particular omadacycline dose group, recruitment for that dose group may be  increased to 
improve the precision of the estimate.  
 Rationale for Study Design   
Omadacycline is the first member of the aminomethylcycline class of antibiotics, which are semisynthetic derivatives of the tetracycline class.  Omadacycline- has in vitro  activity 
against the most common bacterial pathogens associated with cystitis .  Omadacycline has 
been shown to have a significant fraction of the administered dose excreted by [CONTACT_138828].  The safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) of omadacycline have been evaluated in a limited number of adults with cystitis.  
 Rationale for Control Group  
Nitrofurantoin (Macrobid) is approved in the US for the treatment of acute uncomplicated 
urinary tract infection (acute cystitis) at a dose of 100 mg administered orally every 12 hours (q12h) for [ADDRESS_157765] demonstrated equivalent microbiologic eradication with other nitrofurantoin formulations (Macrodantin ).

The comparator drug, nitrofurantoin, is an antibacterial agent specific for urinary tract 
infections.  It has an acceptable and well -defined safety profile.  Nitrofurantoin is 
well-tolerated, can be adm inistered orally, is well -concentrated in the urine and is shown to 
be effective against common uncomplicated UTI uropathogens including E. coli and 
Staphylococcus saprophyticus .  
 Dose Selection Rationale  
The dosing regimen of omadacycline selected for this study is based on the nonclinical and clinical experience to date, including in vitro  antibacterial activity, PK characteristics, 
clinical efficacy in prior studies, and the overall safety and tolerability profile.  Key 
considerations in dose selection are summarized below:  
• While the driver of efficacy for omadacycline in UTI is not known, a pragmatic 
assumption was made that maximizing the time of urine concentration above pathogen 
MIC (ideally, throughout the dosing interval) would be desirable. 
• In PTK 0796- UUTI -[ZIP_CODE], omadacycline dosed as 300 mg po q12h on Day 1 followed by 
300 mg po daily for 5 days and 450 mg po q12h on Day 1 followed by 450 mg po daily 
for 5 days both demonstrated high urinary concentrations on Day 1 and Day 5.  For the 300 mg dosing group, over the 24-hour dosing period, mean urinary concentrations ranged from 14 to  20 µg/mL on Day 1 and 17 to  30 µg/mL on Day 5.  For the 450 mg 
dosing group, over the 24-hour dosing period, mean urinary concentrations ranged from 11 to  25 µg/mL on Day 1 and 30 to  48 µg/mL on Day 5. 
• In PTK0796- UUTI -[ZIP_CODE], both the 300 mg and 450 mg omadacycline treatment groups 
had nausea reported in 60% of subjects.  Vomiting occurred in 40% and 20% of the 300 mg and 450 mg treatment groups, respectively.  In the recently completed PTK0796- ABSI -[ZIP_CODE] study which compared omadacycline 450 mg po every 24 hours 
(q24h) for 2 doses followed by 300 mg po q24h for a total of 7  to 14 days to linezolid 
600 mg po q12h for a total of 7  to 14 days , nausea and vomiting rates of 30.2% and 
16.8% were observed.  In both studies, most events of nausea and vomiting occurred early in the treatment associated with the loading doses of omadacycline.  
• The effect  of a light meal administered approximately 1.5 hours before dosing was 
evaluated using the free base formulation of omadacycline and resulted in approximately 20% decrease in exposure.  In the recently completed study PTK0796- DDI-[ZIP_CODE], t he 
effect of a light meal administered approximately 1.5 hours before dosingwith  the same 
formulation of omadacycline used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies was evaluated .  The 
results demonstrated an approximately 19% to  25% reduction in exposure when a light 
meal was administered 1.5 hours before dosing. 
• The Sponsor has decided to add an omadacycline treatment group dosed at 450 mg twice 
daily for 7 days. The rationale for the change includes: 
1)    Since the driver of efficacy is unknown and the mean renal excretion of a 300 
mg oral dose is 14.4%,  a regimen that maximizes the tolerated dose of 
omadacycline may provide additional information on the dose necessary for

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 32 of 70 clinical and microbiologic success in uUTI and allow comparison to the daily 
dosed omadacycline treatment groups. 
6) The proposed dosing of 450mg twice daily for 7 days will provide 
approximately 2x or greater the amount of omadacycline that is excreted into 
the urine compared to the daily omadacycline treatment groups.   
7) Blinded review of the first 145 subjects reveals good tolerability. Nausea has occurred in approximately 10% of all subjects with only a single subject (0.7%) reporting vomiting. There has been only one treatment disco ntinuation due to adverse events of nausea and/or vomiting reported. 
Therefore, even if all cases of nausea and vomiting were in a single omadacycline treatment group, nausea and vomiting appears lower than observed in  PTK0796- UUTI -[ZIP_CODE] study. 
8) Dose -limiting transaminase increases were seen in Phase 1 studies at 600mg 
IV which is higher than the exposure at 450mg PO twice daily. 
9) Increases in heart rate following omadacycline are Cmax associated . Cmax 
concentrations with the 450mg PO dose (1077 ng/mL) at st eady state are 
approximately one-half the Cmax concentration with the 100mg IV dose (2120 ng/mL) suggesting that heart rate increases above [ADDRESS_157774] of a light meal, urinary co ncentrations should remain above the typi[INVESTIGATOR_138817]

 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
Initially , all eligible subjects will be randomized via an IxRS that assigns them to 1 of the 
5 treatment arms (in a 1:1:1:1:1  ratio).  The site delegate will contact [CONTACT_47893] (via phone or 
web) after confirming that the subject fulfills all the inclusion criteria and  none of the 
exclusion criteria.  The IxRS will assign a test article to the subject based on a 
computer-generated randomization schedule.  The randomization will be a blocked randomization sequence as defined in the IxRS specifications and Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  Subjects randomized into the study will be assigned the treatment corresponding to 
the next available number from the computer- generated randomization schedule.  The subject 
is considered randomized when the IxRS provides the test articl e assignment, regardless of 
whether the subject actually receives any medication .  As this is an adaptive design trial, any 
updates to the randomization schedule based upon the Bayesian analysis will be incorporated into the IxRS system.  
 
7.8.[ADDRESS_157779] should be retained in the 
investigator’s study files.     
 Dispensing Test Article  
Each study site will be supplied by [CONTACT_138842].  Test articles will be supplied to the sites in kits that contain active omadacycline tablets or matched placebo tablets, and active nitrofurantoi n over -encapsulated capsules or 
matched placebo over-encapsulated capsules.  Oral test article supplies are completely 
blinded and blinded study personnel can conduct storage, dispensation, and reconciliation.  The IxRS will  assign the test article kit to  be given to the subject.  The study 
coordinator/staff will instruct the subject on the use of po test article.

 Blinding  
The investigator and s ponsor will be blinded to treatment group assignments throughout the 
study.  The  sponsor designee (eg, study st atistical team, IxRS vendor, etc.) will have a 
designated randomization administrator who will maintain the randomization codes in 
accordance with standard operating procedures to ensure the blind is properly maintained, and that only sponsor personnel who require knowledge of treatment assignments will be unblinded (eg, staff involved in maintaining the randomization codes).  The DMC will review safety data and the results from the Bayesian analysis of efficacy based on masked (treatments groups 1 to  4) treatment assignments.   Based on this analysis, modifications may 
be made to the omadacycline treatment groups.  
The study will follow a double-dummy design.  Subjects assigned to omadacycline will receive active omadacycline tablets and over -encapsulated nitrofurantoin placebo capsules.  
Subjects assigned to the  nitrofurantoin  arm will receive omadacycline placebo tablets and 
over- encapsulated active nitrofurantoin  capsules.  
Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of database lock and 
unblinding at the end of the study.  
Unblinding is only to occur in the case of subject emergencies (see S ection 7.11, below) and 
at the conclusion of the study.  
 Emergency  Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
Emergency unblinding should only be undertaken when it is essential to treat the subject 
safely and efficaciously.  Most often, test article discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an emergency condition.  It is encouraged for the investigator, when contemplating unblinding, to contact [CONTACT_4209]’s designated Medical Monitor or designee to confirm the 
need to unblind, prior to unblinding (see Section [ADDRESS_157780] information).  However, if 
required, the investigator can unblind without consulting the Medical Monitor. 
Emergency code breaks are performed using the IxRS.  When the investigator contacts the 
system to unblind a subject, he/she must provide the requested subject identifying information and confirm the necessity to unblind the subject.  The investigator will then 
receive details of the drug treatment for the specified subject and a fax or e -mail confirming 
that the treatment assignment of the subject was unblinded.  The system will automatically 
inform the s ponsor’s monitor for the site and the sponsor that the code has been broken. 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a procedure in place at their site  to 
allow access to the IxRS code break information in case of emergency.  The investigator will 
inform the subject how to contact [CONTACT_5657]/her backup in cases of emergency when he/she is unavailable.  The investigator will provide protocol number, test article name [CONTACT_90228], 
subject number, and instructions for contact[CONTACT_20610] (or any entity to which it has delegated responsibil ity for emergency code breaks) to the subject in case emergency 
unblinding is required at a time when the investigator and backup are unavailable.

 Informed Consent  
The investigator will provide for the protection of the subjects by [CONTACT_131934].  These regulations are available upon request from the sponsor.  The ICF must be reviewed by [CONTACT_138849]/IEC/REB. 
Before any procedures specified in the protocol are performed, a subject must: 
• Be informed of all pertinent aspects of the study and all elements of informed consent  
• Be given time to ask questions and time to consider the decision to participate 
• Voluntarily agree to participate in the study  
• Sign and date  an IRB/IEC/REB approved ICF  
 Subject Demographics/Other Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographic and Baseline characteristic data to be collected on all subjects include:  
date of birth, gender, and race/ethnicity.   
 Medical History  
The investigator wi ll perform a comprehensive history at the Screening visit.   Significant 
medical history (at any  time)  and any medical history  within the past [ADDRESS_157786]’s condition or health status occurring after signing the 
ICF will be reported as an AE . 
 Physical Examination  
At Screening, a full physical examination will include the examination of general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, and vascular and neurological systems.  If indicated based on medical history and/or symptoms, rectal, external genitalia, breast, and/or pelvic exams may 
be performed.   
Information for all physical examinations must be included in the source documentation at 
the study site.  Significant and relevant findings that are present prior to the start of test

start of test article must be included in the relevant medical history/current medical 
conditions screen on the subject’s eCRF.  Significant findings made after the start of test article which meet the definition of an AE must be recorded on the Adverse Event screen of the subject’s eCRF.  
 Vital Signs  
Vital signs includ e blood pressure ( BP), heart rate, body te mperature, height and body 
weight. 
• Blood pressure and heart  rate should be measured within 30 min before, and 
approximately (± 15 minutes) [ADDRESS_157788]’s vital signs should be captured after at least 5  minutes (+ 5 min utes) of rest 
while in a non- standing position (supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -recumbent, head of bed from 0° to 90°).  
Subsequent vital sign measurements should be captured in the same non-standing position. 
Systolic and diastolic BP will be me asured using an automated validated device, with an 
appropriately sized cuff.  Heart rate will be measured using an automated validated device, when available.  If not 
available, heart rate  will be measured manually.  
Temperature will be obtained using an electronic (rapid reading) device whenever possible.   
 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Clinical laboratory  tests to be performed include hematology (including coagulation), serum  
chemist ry, urine or serum pregnancy assessments, and urinalysis.  The Central Laboratory 
will be used for safety analysis of all specimens collected.  Details on the collection tubes 
and containers, shipment of samples and reporting of results by [CONTACT_138850].  
Because subject enro llment will not permit using Central Laboratory results to assess a 
subject’s meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, it is expected that local laboratory testing will 
be used in circumstances where this testing is needed to assess a subject’s WBC count or differential, serum transaminase or bilirubin levels, serum creatinine or pregnancy testing .  
The total volume of blood collected from each subject will be approximately 4 – 14 mL per visit, or approximately 48 mL (3 tablespoons) over the course of the study.

 Urine Culture and Dipstick Tests  
A clean -catch midstream urine sample should be collected and immediately sent to the local 
microbiology laboratory for microscopic examination and culture.  The  sample should be 
analyzed for pyuria microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897] (WBC count greater than 10/μL in unspun urine or 
greater than or equal to  10 per high power field in spun urine) or by [CONTACT_138852].   Results will be recorded on the eCRF.   
Quantitative urine culture by [CONTACT_138853] a calibrated loop that would identify bacteria at a lower limit of 1.0 × 10
3 colony forming units 
(CFU)/mL.  A study -qualifying pretreatment Baseline culture must grow at least 1 and no 
more than 2 bacterial isolates at ≥ 1.0 × 105 CFU/mL each.  If more than two bacterial 
isolates are identified, the culture will be considered contaminated.  In general, at any visit , 
bacteria identified at 1.0  × 105 CFU/mL or greater should be considered a bacterial pathogen 
(probability of true pathogen is greater than probability of contamination).  At any visit after Screening , a pathogen the same species as the Baseline pathogen with a CFU count of 
≥ 1 × 10
4 CFU/mL should be considered a persisting pathogen.  At any visit after Screening, 
any culture  with a CFU count of < 104 CFU/mL should be considered a negative culture. 
Culture results are to include identification of all pathogens to the level of genus and species.  
In vitro  antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates to antimicrobial drugs that may be 
used to treat UTIs can be performed locally using a standard method chosen by [CONTACT_25699].  
All bacterial isolates that grow ≥ 10
3 CFU/mL (whe ther at Baseline or post- Baseline ) 
identified by [CONTACT_138854], nitrofurantoin  and a pan el of other  antibiotics.  In the event that local 
laboratory genus and species identification are not consistent with Central Laboratory results, a back -up isolate should be sent to the Central Laboratory.   
Details concerning cultures and shipment to the Central Laboratory will be provided in a 
Clinical Microbiology Laboratory Manual.  
The investigator may use the culture and susceptibility results from the local microbiology 
laboratory to help guide therapy; however, decisions to continue or discontinue t est article 
should be based on clinical response rather than susceptibility results (as omadacycline susceptibility testing is not available at the local site).  The decision to continue or 
discontinue study treatment should be based on the subject's clini cal course and the 
investigator’s clinical judgment.  The rationale for this decision should be recorded in source 
documents.

 Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given a test article or in a clinical study.  The event does not need to be causally related to the test article or clinical study.  An AE includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
Omadacycline   Paratek Pharmaceuticals, LLC 
PTK0796 -UUTI -[ZIP_CODE] -Version 3.0 FINAL; 18-FEB- 2019 IND # 75,928 IND # 73,431 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 45 of 70 • Any clinically significant worsening of a preexisting condition. 
• An AE occurring from overdose of a test article,  whether accidental or intentional.  
Overdose is a dose greater than that specified in the protocol.  
• An AE occurring from abuse (eg, use for nonclinical reasons) of a test article  
• An AE that has been associated with the discontinuation of the use of a test article  
 Serious Adverse Events  
A Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) is an AE that:  
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening (see below)  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138820] g hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see below) 
• Results in a persistent or significant disab ility or incapacity (see below)  
• Results in a con genital anomaly or birth defect 
• Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any one (1) of the outcomes listed  above in this definition.  
Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Life-threatening refers to immediate risk of death as the event occurred per the reporter.  A 
life-threatening exp erience does not include an experience, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death, but as it actually occurred, did not create an immediate risk of death.  For example, hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening, even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal.  Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm, or 
anaphylaxis can be fatal.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138821] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138822]; however, it is not in itself considered an SAE.  In absence of an AE, a h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138823] i nvestigator.  This is the 
case in the following situations: 
• The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required  
by [CONTACT_760] 
• The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112042] a routine procedure 
followed by [CONTACT_16018] (eg, stent removal after surgery).  This should be recorded in the study file. 
• A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113617] a preexisting condition that has not worsened

functions. 
If there is any doubt about whether the information constitutes an SAE, the information is 
treated as an SAE.  
 Other Reportable Infor mation   
Certain information, although not considered an SAE, must be recorded, reported, and followed up as indicated for an SAE.  This includes: 
• Pregnancy exposure to a test article :  If a pregnancy is confirmed, use of the test article 
must be discontinued immediately.  Information about pregnancy exposure includes the 
entire course of pregnancy and delivery, and perinatal and neonatal outcomes, even if there are no abnormal findings.   
• Lactation  exposure to a test article with or without an AE  
• Overdose of a test article as specified in this protocol with or without an AE  
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a tes t article with or without an AE  
 
 Overdose  
Any administration of omadacycline of g reater than [ADDRESS_157793]’s 
treatment assignment by [CONTACT_123517].  I nteractive Response S ystem  will also provide 
a confirmation report of the drug assignment to site personnel.  The site personnel will retain this confirmation report.   In the case of a potential overdose, the subject should maintain a 
high level of fluid intake to promote ur inary excretion ( as recommended  in the nitrofurantoin 
USPI
11). 
The physician managing the overdose may order any test he/she thinks is necessary to manage the subject properly. 
 Medication Errors  
Medication errors are the result of administration or consumption of the wrong product, by [CONTACT_1148], at the wrong time, and/or by [CONTACT_138855], due to human error.   
Medication err ors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• The administration  and/or consumption of test article that has n ot been assigned to the 
subject 
• Administration  of expi[INVESTIGATOR_138824], LLC

associated with a medication error.  A medication error associated with an SAE (including overdose, inadvertent exposure, and/or accidental exposure) will be reported wi th the SAE on 
the SAE Report  Form.  All other medication errors will be reported by  e-mailing the Clinical 
Test Article Error Incident Report Form as indicated in the Emergency Contacts (see 
Section  2). 
 Recording and Reporting  
A subject’s AEs and SAEs will be recorded and reported from the signing of the ICF to the time of the Final Follow -up assessment.  The investigat or must instruct the subject to report 
AEs and SAEs during this time period.  Reports of death within [ADDRESS_157795] should be asked the following nonspecific question :  "How have you 
been feeling since your last visit?"  Whenever possible, AEs should be reported as a 
diagnosis rather than individual signs and symptoms.  If a definitive diagnosis is not possible, the individual signs and symptoms should be recorded using standard medical terminology. 
If an AE requires a surgical or diagnostic procedure, the illness leading to the procedure should be recorded as the AE, not the procedure itself.  
Death should be recorded in the eCRF as an outcome of an AE.  Any unanticipated risks to the subjects must be reported promptly to the IRB/IEC/REB.

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 48 of 70 8.15.2 Assessment of Relatedness 
The investigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that test 
article  caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs.  The relationship will be characterized using 
the following classificati on: 
• Not related:  This relationship suggests that there is no association between test article  
and the reported  event.  The event can be explained by [CONTACT_138857], concomitant therapy, or accident, and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists between test article and the event.  
• Related:   This relationship suggests that a definite causal relationship exists between test 
article  administration  and the AE, or there is a reasonable possibility that the event  was 
caused by [CONTACT_7860], and other conditions (concurrent illness, 
progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent medication reaction) do not appear 
to explain the event. 
AEs and SAEs  also will be assessed for their potential relationsh ip to the protocol.  A 
protocol- related adverse event is one that is not related to the test article, but is considered by 
[CONTACT_55886] (or designee) to be related to the research conditions, 
ie, related to the fact that a subjec t is participating in the study.  For example, a protocol-
related AE may be an untoward event related to a medical procedure required by [CONTACT_760]. 
8.15.3 Assessment of Severity  
The severity (or intensity) of an AE will be classified using the following criter ia: 
• Mild:  These events are usually transient, require minimal or no treatment, and do not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate:  These events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures.  Moderate events may cause some interference with normal 
functioning but pose no significant or permanent risk of harm. 
• Severe:  These events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment.  Severe events are usually incapacitating. 
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented as a new event to allow an 
assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed.

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 49 of 70 8.15.5 Worsening or Progression of Disease Under S tudy  
Worsening or progression of the qualifying UTI should be recorded as a clinical failure (as 
part of the efficacy assessment), rather than an AE, unless the worsening/progression also meets the criteria for a serious AE (in which case the event also sh ould be reported as an 
SAE).   In contrast, any new  or secondary  infections that the investigator considers to be 
distinct from the qualifying UTI should be reported as AEs in all cases, whether non -serious 
or serious. 
8.15.[ADDRESS_157798] article should be discontinued immediately and the pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_68477].  Pregnancy follow-up should be recorded on the same form and 
should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the test article of any pregnancy outcome.  Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form.  
 Concomitant Medication Assessments  
The investigator should instruct the subject to notify the study site about any new medications she takes aft er the start of the test article.   
All prescription medications, OTC drugs, and recreational drugs taken within the timeframe defined in the entry criteria  prior to the start of the study and during the study, must be 
recorded on the Prior/Concomitant Medications page of the e CRF.   Medication entries 
should be specific to trade name, the single d ose and unit, the frequency and route of 
administration, the start and discontinuation date s, and the reason for therapy. 
 Subject Discontinuation or Withdrawal  
Reasons why a subject may discontinue or be withdrawn from the study include, but are not limite d to, AE, lost to follow up, withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130], physician decision, death, and other 
(specify reason eg, subject non-compliance or study termination by [CONTACT_456]) .  Subjects 
may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time.  Subject s are considered 
withdrawn from the study if they state an intention to withdraw, or fail to return for visits, or become lost to follow up for any other reason.  If premature withdrawal from the study occurs for any reason, the investigator should determi ne the primary reason for a subject’s 
premature withdrawal from the study and record this information on the eCRF.

 General Considerations  
All analyses of data for this study will comply with International Conference on 
Harmonisation  (ICH)  of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for 
Human Use (ICH-E9) and the sponsor’s guidance documents and standards.  Statistical analyses will be performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS
®). 
A Statistical A nalysis Plan incorporating the sections below and with mock table, figure, and 
listing (TFL) shells will be prepared, approved and finalized by [CONTACT_77809].  This plan will define populations for analysis, outline all data handling conventions, and specify statistical methods to be used for analysis of safety and efficacy.  Analyses of PK 
endpoints will be described in a separate analysis plan.  
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, an d 
the numbers, means, standard deviation (SD), medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables will be provided.  Exploratory analyses may also be performed.  Listings of individual subject’s data will be produced. 
All eCRFs must be completed, entered and checked; all safety laboratory results must have 
been reported; all AEs must have been fully characterized (eg , relationship to test article 
determined) and coded; and all queries must have been resolved prior to database lock and unblinding.  Det ermination of inclusion in the analysis populations, characterization of 
protocol deviations as major/minor and final approval of the SAP will also be completed prior to database lock. 
 Determination of Sample  Size 
Enrollment of a total of approximately 225 subjects is planned.  The Bayesian posterior probability that the clinical success rate at the PTE Visit is within 0.10 of that of the nitrofurantoin group will be estimated for each omadacycline dose group.  The target probability is 0.80.  If the true u nderlying clinical success rates for the nitrofurantoin and 
omadacycline dose groups are 0.82, then the sample size of N = 50 per treatment has approximately 79% power/probability to yield the target probability (N  = 53 per treatment for 
80% power).  The sample size may be increased for a particular omadacycline dose group by [CONTACT_138832]/or droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a dose group to achieve improved power/probability of achieving the target probability that clinical s uccess rates for a dose 
group is within 0.[ADDRESS_157806] been defined:

population who have a study-qualifying pre- treatment Baseline urine culture with 1  or 2 
uropathogens at ≥ 105 CFU/mL .   
• The clinically evaluable (CE) population will consist of all ITT subjects who received 
test article, have a qualifying infection, an assessment of outcome, and meet all other 
evaluability criteria detailed in the SAP  
• The microbiologically evaluable (ME) population will include subjects in the CE 
population who have a study-qualifying pre- treatment Baseline urine culture with 1 or 
2 uropathogens at ≥ 105 CFU/mL .   
 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics (including age, ethnicity and race) and Baseline characteristics will be 
summarized in the ITT population by [CONTACT_1570].  
Descriptive statistics of the duration of test article treatment will be provided by [CONTACT_6490].  The number and percentage of subjects who prematurely discontinued test article and the reason for discontinuation and the number and percentage of subjects prematurely discontinuing the study and the primary reason for discontinuation will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. 
 Primary  Endpoint(s)  
12.5.1 Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the Investigator’ s assessment of clinical success at PTE in 
the ITT population.  The number and percentage of subjects with an Investigator’ s 
assessment of clinical success, clinical failure and indeterminate response at the PTE visit 
will be determined by [CONTACT_138862].  Exact 95% confidence intervals will be determined for the point estimates of the clinical success rates in each 
treatment group. 
A comparison  of the clinical success rate at the PTE Visit between each omadacycline dose 
group and the  nitrofurantoin group will be conducted using a beta distribution with an 
uninformative Bayesian prior distribution.   Additional analyses on the primary efficacy 
endpoint will be performed using Bayesian modeling.  Details are described in SAP.  
 Secondary Endpoint(s)  
12.6.1 Safety Endpoint(s)  
All safety analyses will utilize the Safety population.  Summary tables will be provided for 
all treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  A TEAE is defined as an AE with a start 
date and time on or after the first dose of test article.  AEs will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will be summarized by [CONTACT_138863], LLC

The number and percentage of subjects with an Investigator’ s assessment of clinical success, 
clinical failure and indeterminate response at the EOT Visit (ITT and CE populations; by 
[CONTACT_138868]) and PTE 
visit (CE  and micro -ITT population) will be determined by [CONTACT_1570].  Exact 95% 
confidence intervals will be determined for the point estimates of the clinical success rates in 
each treatment group. 
The number and percentage of subjects with a  microbiologic failure, success and 
indeterminate response at the EOT and PTE Visits (micro -ITT and ME populations; by 
[CONTACT_138869]) will be 
determined by [CONTACT_1570].  Exact 95% c onfidence intervals will be determined for the 
point estimates of the microbiologic success rates in each treatment group. 
 Interim  Analysis  
This is an adaptive dose-response finding study. Bayesian analysis will be conducted when 
primary efficacy endpoint data (investigator assessment of clinical response at PTE) is 
available from 40, 80 and 100 subjects in order to: 
• Determine  if omadacycline dose group(s) that can be dropped from the trial, or 
• Modify the randomization ratios among the omadacycline dose groups to improve the 
precision of the selected dose group comparison of clinical success to that of the nitrofurantoin  group. 
Additional analyses may be carried out for these same two purposes.  Response criteria are targeted toward estimating the probability that the clinical success rate (proportion of subjects) for each dose group is within 10% of that of the nitrofurantoin group.  If at the specified analysis time point, that probability falls below 30% for a particular omadacycline 
dose group, r ecruitment for that omadacycline dose group may be stopped or curtailed by 
[CONTACT_138870].  If that probability exceeds 80% for a particular

Results from the Bayesian analysis will be reviewed by a DMC to determine if enrollment in 
any omadacycline treatment arms should be stopped or modified.  Modifications to 
omadacycline dosing regime ns/treatment arms may also be based on safety and tolerability.  
A DMC charter describing the composition of the DMC, roles and responsibilities, and statistical parameters will be developed and finalized prior to the first data review.  
 Data Monitoring Committee  
A DMC will provide ongoing monitoring of data.  Th e charter for the D MC will clearly 
outline membership, all roles, responsibilities, and decision-making criteria.  This will 
include a detailed description of the manner in which security and blinding of the data for the study management team  will be maintained, in addition to the procedures that ensure the 
independence and objectivity of t he DMC’s activities.  As the DMC will be reviewing data 
for this study, it may require reports indicating treatment assignment to assist in clinical interpretation of its findings.  Therefore, the D MC charter will provide a detailed explanation 
of the processes by [CONTACT_138872].

AE = adverse event; β-hCG  = β-human chorionic gonadotropin ; BP = blood pressure; CFU  = colony forming unit;  eCRF  = electronic case report form; 
EOT = end of treatment; ICF  = informed consent form; PK = pharmacokinetics; PTE  = post therapy evaluation; SAE  = serious adverse event ; UTI = 
urinary tract infection;  UTISA= urinary tract infection system assessment;  WBC = white blood cell . 
a Follow ing the signing of an ICF, all Screening  evaluations  should be completed within the [ADDRESS_157825] assessment of UTI signs and symptoms severity will be collected daily through EOT  (including self -completion by [CONTACT_138877] 2, 4 and 
6), at PTE and at Final Follow -up via the UTISA questionnaire . 
f Treatments that have been administered within the [ADDRESS_157826] be recorded in the eC RF. 
g A clean -catch, midstream urine sample should be collected and immediately sent to the local microbiology laboratory for microscopic evaluation and culture.  
Quantitative urine culture by [CONTACT_138853] a calibrated loop that would identify bacteria at a lower limit of 103 CFU/mL.   
White blood cell counts should be measured by [CONTACT_138878].  The 
statement “or microscopic evaluation for white blo od cells” refers to the alternative method to assess for the presence of pyuria (inclusion #4), but the 
dipstick assessment is required regardless of how inclusion is assessed.  
h Urine isolates that grow ≥ 103 CFU/mL (whether at Baseline  or post -Baseline ) and are not deemed to be a contaminant as detailed in the Micro Manual, 
are to be sent from the local lab to the Central Lab  for further analysis.  
i A full physical examination will be completed at Screening, thereafter only changes from Screening  assess ment s should be recorded as AEs in the eCRFs.  
j BP and heart rate should be measured within 30 min before, and approximately 1 hour  (± 15 minutes) after and 3 hours  (± 15 minutes) after the 
completion of the first dose on Day  1.   
k Hematology includes coagulation. 
l All subjects will have a local urine or serum pregnancy test  at Screening which results will be used to confirm eligibility.  
m All subjects will have blood collected for a serum β -hCG pregnancy test at the Cent ral Laboratory at the Screening and  EOT visits .   
n A subject’s AEs and SAEs will be recorded and reported from signing of the ICF to the Final Follow -up assessment.  
o Subjects should receive their first dose of test article within [ADDRESS_157827] article and site staff will 
perform accountability.  
p Dose 2 can be taken a minimum of 8 hours and up to 12 hours after Dose 1.  Dose 3 should be taken a minimum of 8 hours after Dose 2.  
q PK blood collection to occur on Day 1 ([ADDRESS_157828] article) and Day 5.  
r A PTE will occ ur on Day 14 (+/- 2 days) after the subject’s first dose of test article .  
s A Final Follow -up will occur [ADDRESS_157829] article.  The Final Follow -up may be performed via phone call  or another 
interactive technology .  
t During the Follow -up call/visit if the subject reports symptoms of potential recurrence, additional procedures will be performed.  
u Hematology and serum chemistry will be repeated if any clinically significant abnormalit ies are  noted at the EOT visit.

Date and Version:  Version 3, 18 February 2019 
Change  Rationale for Change  
Addition of 450mg BID omadacycline  
treatment arm, to be dosed 
approximately 2 hours after a light 
meal.  Based on the pharmacokinetic, clinical, and safety 
data, the 450mg twice daily dose will increase 
urinary concentration, may provide additional 
clinical and microbiologic benefit while maintaining 
the safety profile observed with daily dosing. Refer 
to the protocol for additional/detailed rationale 
supporting this change.  
Increased sample size to approximately 
225 subjects (previously approximately 
200 subjects).  The approximate total  enrollment will increase to 
accommodate the addition of the 450mg BID 
treatment arm. The initial goal was to enroll at least 
n=53 subjects per arm for final analysis. Sample size 
may be increased for a particular omadacycline dose 
group, based on recommen dations from DMC to 
change randomization ratio and/or drop a dose group 
to achieve improved power/probability of achieving 
the target probability that clinical success rates for a 
dose group is within 0.10 of that of the nitrofurantoin 
group.   
Addition o f statement regarding 
omadacycline approved uses  Omadacycline has recently been FDA -approved for 
CABP & ABSSSI (since original version of protocol 
was written)  
Increased the approximate duration of 
the study to 24 months  Due to enrollment  progressing slower than originally 
projected and the addition of 25 subjects to overall 
sample size  
Indicated that additional analyses on 
the primary efficacy endpoint will be 
performed using Bayesian modeling.  An additional sensitivity analysis will be  conducted 
on the efficacy endpoints to ensure improved 
interpretation and precision of estimates of efficac y 
analysis for dose selection.

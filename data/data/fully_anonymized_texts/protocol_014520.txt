 1 1. Comparison Details  
a. Intended aim(s)  
  
 To compare the risk of cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction or stroke), between patients treated 
with tofacitinib and patients treated with TNF inhibitors  (TNFi)  for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among, 1) “real world 
evidence (RWE) ” cohort s including routine care patient population from the US  and, 2) “Randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) DUPLICATE ” cohort s including routine c are patient population who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria of 
the Safety Study Of Tofacitinib Versus Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Inhibitor In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis  
(“ORAL Surveillance ”, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) clinical trial.  
 
 To examine the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke , heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , coronary revascularization, and 
all-cause mortality as separated endpoints when comparing  tofacitinib with  TNFi  in patient s with RA among, 1) 
“real world evidence (RWE) ” cohort including routine care patient population from the US  and, 2) “Randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) DUPLICATE ” cohort including routine care patient population who meet inclusion and 
exclusion criteria of the  Safety Study Of Tofacitinib Versus Tumor Necrosis Factor (TN F) Inhibitor In Subjects With 
Rheumatoid Arthritis  (“ORAL Surveillance ”, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) clinical trial.  
 
b. Primary endpoint  
 Major adverse cardiovascular events (MI and stroke)  
 
2. Person res ponsible for implementation of analysis   
Hemin Lee, MD, MPH will implement the study design  and analysis  in the Aetion Evidence Platform. She is not 
responsible for the validity of the design and analytic choices. All implementation steps will be recorded and the 
implementation history will be archived in the platform.  Propensity score  (PS) fine stratification  weighting  will be 
implemented using SAS statistical software  (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) .

 5 5. Cohort Identification  
 
a. Cohort Summary  
 
This study will employ a n active comparator,  new user  observational cohort study design comparing  initiators of  
tofacitinib to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors ( infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, and 
golimumab) .[ADDRESS_521213] continuous enrollment  in their health plan  during the baseline period 
of 365 days before initiation of tofacitinib  or TNFi ( cohort entry date ). Follow -up begins the day after drug initiation .  
 
There will be two independent study population s: 
 
1) Real-World Evidence (RWE)  cohorts : This study population will reflect the patients  diagnosed with RA who are  
routinely treated  and managed  in setting of clinical practice . 
 
2) RCT-duplicate  cohorts : This study population will emulate  “the Safety Study Of Tofacitinib Versus Tumor Necrosis 
Factor (TNF) Inhibitor In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis ” clinical trial  (“ORAL Surveillance ”, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria of this RCT will be applied to this study population.

 A minimum of 365 days of continuous enrollment in health plan prior to (and including) the cohort entry date

 11 8. Study Follow -up Period:  
 
For the primary analysis, we will implement an as-treated  exposure definition. F ollow -up will start the day after initiation of 
tofacitinib and TNFi  and will continue until the earliest date of the following events:  
 
 The first occurrence of the outcome of interest  
 The date of end of enrollment in the database  
 End of the study period  
 Date of treatment switch or drug discontinuation, defined as the dat e of the last continuous treatment epi[INVESTIGATOR_413594] a defined grace period (i.e., discontinuation defined after [ADDRESS_521214] recent dispensing)  
 Death 
 
For secondary analysis, we will implement, an intention -to-treat exposure definition. Follow -up will start the day after 
initiation of tofacitinib and TNFi and will continue until the earliest date of the following events:  
 
 The first occurrence of the outc ome of interest  
 The date of end of enrollment in the database  
 End of the study period  
 Death  
 365 days after the cohort entry  date

 12 9. Propensity score  fine stratification  analysis   
We will use a propensity -score (PS) -based approach to account for measured confounding in this study.[ADDRESS_521215] (i.e., tofacitinib ) conditional on baseline covariates 
using multivariable logistic regression constructed separately in each data source.[ADDRESS_521216] ratum into which they fel l to achieve covariate balance (Nexposed in PS stratum i/ Ntotal)/ (N reference 
in PS stratum i /Ntotal reference ).[ADDRESS_521217] on the treated (ATT).[ADDRESS_521218] deviation 
(SD), interquartile range (IQR), and range (minimum, maximum) for continuous variables, will be used to summarize 
baseline characteristics for each study cohort . Standardized differences will be used to compare ch aract eristics  before and  
after PS fine stratification  weighting .5,6 Crude incidence rates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals  (CI) will be 
reported for each study outcome. The p rimary analysis will consist of  Cox proportional hazards mode l weight ed using PS 
fine stratification weights and using an as-treated  exposure definition . This model  will generate weighted hazard ratio and 
95% confidence inter val when comparing tofacitinib with TNFi . We will also report difference in rates when comparing 
tofacitinib with TNFi and corresponding 95% CI in the weighted population. Results will be reported independently for each 
database. Effect estimates w ill also be pooled across three databases using fixed effects model .  
 
We will also report cumu lative i ncidence and the corresponding  95% CI independently for all outcomes  and each study 
group . Pre-specified subgroup analysis will be conducted based on  age (≤65 and > 65), sex, and baseline cardiovascular 
disease  (RWE cohorts only ). Secondary analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_413599] -to-treat exposure definition 
whereby [CONTACT_413600] [ADDRESS_521219]

 13 neighbor greedy matching without replacement using a caliper of 0.025 on the natural scale of the PS  (1:1 matching) .3,7 
Standardized differences will be used to compare characteristics before and after matching. In addition, we will examine  the 
risk of cardiovascular outcomes and all -cause mortality  by [CONTACT_413601]  (no previous prescriptions of bDMARDs vs ≥1 prescription of bDMARDs).  Finally, sensitivity analyses  will be 
conducted by r estrict ing the TNFi comparator group to only adalimumab and etanercept users  and by [CONTACT_413602] a positive control outcome .8

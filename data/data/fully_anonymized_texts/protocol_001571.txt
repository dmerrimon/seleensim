[LOCATION_001], NY  [ZIP_CODE]   Objectives:  The primary efficacy outcome for colorectal cancer is post -implantation all -
cause mortality, where time to death is defined as the time from the first 
scan showing disease progre ssion after completion of prior treatment (time 
of origin, T 0) to death from any cause.  
 
The primary objective for pancreatic cancer is to determine the Response 
Rate (RR), at [ADDRESS_73421] ives for both pancreatic and colorectal cancer are 
outlined in Section 3 of this protocol.  
 Rationale for 
Dosage:  Based on the animal studies conducted to date, as well as the Phase I 
human trial that has enrolled 31 subjects to date, a reasonable dosage 
range (number of beads to be implanted) is [ADDRESS_73422] with a single dose, this 
number was not seen to be any more eff ective than 8 macrobeads per 
kilogram. As it is planned to carry out up to four implants (over 
approximately 12 months) in this Phase II trial, each implantation will be 
carried out at the 8 macrobeads per kilogram dosage.  Study Design:  This is an open -label clinical trial. The clinical trial will have duration of [ADDRESS_73423] implan t follow -up visits will 
be done in reference to the corresponding Implantations i.e. Days 14, 30, 
60 and 90.  Because much of the testing will be objective in terms of

 Version: Amendment 11   CONFIDENTIAL   Page 13 of 77 November 12th 2014            2 BACKGROUND   Treatment for cancer has traditionally consisted of three modalities: surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.  Advances with all three modalities over the years have produced some long-term remissions and/or cures in certain types of cancer such as the leukemias, and prolonged survival for many other patients.  The advent of targeted, often more “biological” therapi[INVESTIGATOR_67325], inhibitors of angiogenesis, inhibitors of, and antibodies to, specific receptors such as mTor, HER-2, VEGF, and EGFR, has further changed the face of anti-cancer therapy.  Much remains to be accomplished, however, especially with respect to the treatment of solid tumors, including some of the most common and deadly cancers such as those of the lung, colon, breast, ovary, prostate, pancreas, and kidney.  New types of less toxic, less debilitating and more effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_66039].   Pancreatic cancer:  Carcinoma of the pancreas has had a markedly increased incidence during the past several decades and ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the [LOCATION_002] (American Cancer Society, 2009; Greenlee et al, 2000). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_67326], its etiology is poorly understood.  Cancer of the exocrine pancreas is rarely curable and has an overall survival (OS) rate of less than 4%[Greenlee et al, 2000]. The highest cure rate occurs if the tumor is truly localized to the pancreas; however, this stage of the disease accounts for fewer than 20% of cases. For those patients with localized disease and small cancers (<2 cm) with no lymph node metastases and no extension beyond the capsule of the pancreas, complete surgical resection can yield actuarial 5-year survival rates of 18% to 24%. (Yeo et al, 1997). Improvements in imaging technology, including spi[INVESTIGATOR_67327], magnetic resonance imaging scans, positron emission tomographic scans, endoscopic ultrasound examination, and laparoscopic staging can aid in the diagnosis and the identification of patients with disease that is not amenable to resection. For patients with advanced cancers, the OS rate of all stages is less than 1% at [ADDRESS_73443] for pancreatic cancer; markers such as serum CA 19-[ADDRESS_73444] an elevated CA 19-9 at diagnosis. Following or during definitive therapy, the increase of CA 19-9 levels may identify patients with progressive tumor growth. The presence of a normal CA 19-9, however, does not preclude recurrence.  
   The Rogosin Institute  Protocol No.  [PHONE_1600]  
 Version: Amendment 11   CONFIDENTIAL   Page 14 of 77 November 12th 2014           According to the National Cancer Institute (www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/types/pancreatic), patients with any stage of pancreatic cancer can appropriately be considered candidates for clinical trials because of the poor response to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery as conventionally used.  One such trial is the gemcitabine, docetaxel, capecitabine (GTX) therapy being utilized at Columbia University by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Robert Fine and his colleagues (Phase II). Colorectal cancer: In contrast to pancreatic cancer, cancer of the colon is a highly treatable and often curable disease when localized to the bowel. Surgery is the primary form of treatment and results in cure in approximately 50% of the patients. Recurrence following surgery is a major problem and is often the ultimate cause of death.  The prognosis of patients with colon cancer is clearly related to the degree of penetration of the tumor through the bowel wall, the presence or absence of nodal involvement, and the presence or absence of distant metastases. Beyond those characteristics, elevated pretreatment serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) have a negative prognostic significance.  The fact is, however, that, even with good prognostic factors and aggressive chemotherapy with regimens such as FOLFOX and FOLFIRI, with or without the addition of bevacizumab and cetuximab (the latter for KRAS+ patients), many patients become resistant to available chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_67328].  In addition, the other surgical and ablative techniques may no longer be applicable. With liver and lung metastases common problems, and brain metastases less common, but potentially devastating, there clearly is a need for new, more effective therapeutic measures, especially for those patients who do have metastatic spread of their tumors Among the therapeutic possibilities currently being explored for pancreatic and colorectal cancer, as well as other solid tumors, those that involve cellular biological control mechanisms seem both promising and attractive. Many such modalities-- such as induction of terminal differentiation, enhancement of growth-inhibitory (negative) feedback, selective programmed cell death (apoptosis), targeted insertion of viral or other genes into the proliferating cancer cell, and growth arrest at either the G1-S or G2-M checkpoints of the cell cycle -- all seem to be feasible goals with significant potential for clinical use.  Furthermore, recent data suggest that a subpopulation of cells within a tumor, i.e., the so-called cancer stem or progenitor cells, which have been described and characterized in certain tumor types such as those of the brain (glioma series), colon, and breast, may, in fact, be responsible for tumor survival, progression, resistance, and metastasis.  Should these observations be verified, these cell populations represent a novel and fundamental target for anti-neoplastic therapy.  
   The Rogosin Institute  Protocol No.  [PHONE_1600]  
 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_73445].  It is increasingly clear that cancer is not simply the result of a rogue, mutated cell or clone of cells exhibiting unrestricted proliferative and metastatic behavior.  Rather, cancer is itself a biological system, in a sense a kind of (undesirable) organ and/or organ system. Furthermore, cancer is not a entirely separate entity within the host, but rather dependent on complex interactions with the host as a whole and its own microenvironment, just as a normal organ is. The local microenvironment may, in fact, aid and abet the neoplastic cells, providing them with blood flow and nutrition, for example. The “normal” host cells in the microenvironment may not be normal at all, but may become incorporated into the structure and workings of the tumor.  In other words, the tumor is a heterogeneous collection of interdependent cells, the least desirable of which may be what we think of as the neoplastic cells.  Those cells, however, are only part of the story.   The fact that cancer is, in effect, an alternative organ system, suggests that it should be subject to at least some of the same regulatory processes that govern normal, physiologic system function.  One such process, the control of proliferation in a normal organ, is quite strict.  Although it has long been thought that cancer cells and the tumors they form are not subject to the same regulatory growth-control feedback mechanisms as are normal cells and organs, increasing evidence suggests that they are, in fact, subject to such regulation. Not surprisingly, an important signal in the growth-regulatory process for tumor cells is the mass of tumor present. Tumor growth slows as the mass of both primary and metastatic tumors increase (7-12). Surgeons, for example, have observed that surgical excision of part of a tumor mass can be associated with rapid re-growth of the remaining tumor and/or distant metastases (13,14).  De Wys (15) and Fisher et al (16) have demonstrated the same phenomenon in animal models of tumors.  We have been able to confirm this ourselves in a mouse tumor model involving the injection of mouse renal adenocarcinoma cells under the renal capsule. In these studies, removal of the primary tumor at an early stage of development of the malignancy has resulted in the appearance of dramatically greater numbers of distal metastases. Taking these various findings into account, it is not unreasonable to argue, as Prehn has done (17), that a promising therapeutic approach to the biological control of tumor growth could consist of “fooling” tumors into sensing that their mass is greater than it actually is, thereby [CONTACT_67345].  The proposed cancer treatment to be tested in the Phase II clinical trial outlined in this protocol is based, at least in part, on the concept that tumor growth 
   The Rogosin Institute  Protocol No.  [PHONE_1600]  
 Version: Amendment 11   CONFIDENTIAL   Page 16 of 77 November 12th 2014           can be controlled by [CONTACT_67346].  In this case, however, the induction of such signals is brought about not by [CONTACT_67347], but rather by [CONTACT_67348] a proliferation-restrictive hydrophilic matrix composed of agarose.  In brief, cancer cells (in this case, mouse renal adenocarcinoma cells) placed in such a growth-restrictive matrix contained within the structure of a 6-8mm “macrobead’ are induced to produce and release signals that can inhibit the proliferation of free cancer cells of the same and different types (and without species specificity) both in vitro and in vivo.   Translated into practical clinical terms, the release of such inhibitory signals from cancer cells in a proliferation-restrictive environment could be useful in the treatment of human cancers.  Based on our continued laboratory and clinical studies with the macrobead approach to the control of the cancerous growth, we can say that the mechanisms by [CONTACT_67349]. In fact, the cells that survive to function in the bead have at least some of the properties of cancer stem or progenitor cells.  These colonies are comprised of cells that secrete inhibitory factor(s), which, in turn, regulate a variety of processes in the freely growing cancer cells.  These affected processes include regulation of the cell-cycle check points (G1S and G2M), DNA synthesis/replication, cell-cell interactions, angiogenesis, cellular metabolism and cytoskeletal function more generally.  In other words, the macrobeads themselves constitute an altered, constrained neoplastic system with the capability of influencing the behavior of other, non-constrained neoplastic systems.  In vivo, these changes are achieved without any evident impairment to date of normal body functions, including that of the immune system.  In fact, data from our Phase I clinical trial show that the human immune system is of normal to increased activity after the beads have been placed.   The heterogeneous renal adenocarcinoma cell population initially placed in the agarose matrix of the macrobead undergoes dramatic depopulation followed by [CONTACT_67350].  Specifically, colonies emerge that contain both cells with stem cell-like properties and cells with other as yet undefined properties.  The latter group has features suggestive of the tumor “niches” that have now been described in a range of tumors.  These niches represent the bodies that are now postulated to be responsible for tumor generation and survival/perpetuation.  They are likely also to be the source of the cells that can break loose and form both local and distant metastases. In vivo, niches are composed of cells morphologically and molecularly similar to those seen in the macrobeads, but have the additional feature of being surrounded by [CONTACT_67351], as well as possibly external therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Quite apart from their biological importance in neoplasia, the niches represent a unique endpoint for assessing the anti-neoplastic efficacy of the macrobeads.

 Version: Amendment 11   CONFIDENTIAL   Page 17 of 77 November 12th 2014            While the properties of the cancer stem cells, “niches”, and the macrobeads that contain them are of significant scientific interest, their precise mechanism of anti-tumor action has yet to be fully explored.  Genomic studies of the cells within the colonies in the macrobeads show striking up-regulation of certain genes such as CHOPP and GADD45.   One or more, or all, of the proteins produced by [CONTACT_67352], which can be measured by [CONTACT_954], can be released into the medium and serve as the postulated signals to the freely-growing cancer cells. Whatever the outcome of this important line of research, however, there is solid evidence in preclinical studies that the macrobeads may yield clinically important results.  Preclinical studies in mouse tumor models, both in vivo and in vitro, have indicated statistically significant activity of the macrobeads with respect to suppression of tumor growth.  Studies in [ADDRESS_73446] 50%.  Increased activity levels and weight gain have also characterized these animals after RENCA macrobead implantation consistent with an improved quality of life.   New and ongoing in vitro laboratory studies with human tumor cell lines including those with an androgen-independent, docetaxel-resistant human prostate cell line have shown that the macrobeads can slow or stop the proliferation of these cells when no other agents are effective.  These in vitro studies, plus in vivo tests with the same tumor line in an immunodeficient mouse tumor model, add further, preclinical support to the trial proposed here. If the macrobeads continue to be effective after cancer cells have developed resistance to all currently available agents, then they could have a place in the clinical treatment of advanced cancers, let alone those at an earlier stage.  The Phase I trial of the cancer macrobeads in the initially targeted 13 subjects with a variety of Stage IV, end-stage, treatment-resistant epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]-derived tumors has enrolled and implanted 31 subjects to date, 21 more than the original goal of 10. It has demonstrated that the macrobeads are well tolerated when implanted in the human abdominal cavity for periods of up to 24 months.  Tumor types evaluated in the safety/toxicity trial have included colorectal carcinoma, gall bladder cancer (cholangiocarcinoma), gastric carcinoma (schirrous type), pancreatic carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and non-small cell lung carcinoma.  There was no pattern of any consistent adverse effect attributable to the macrobeads.  Rather, the problems that did occur were attributable to the disease process itself.  Phase I study is closed for the subject accrual and is only open for data analysis.

Circulating tumor cells will also be measured  3.2.3 Exploratory objectives  An addition to the endpoints for assessing efficacy will be, where possible, when a biopsy is indicated, a careful search for, and identification of, the niches of cancer stem and other cells within the niche bodies of the tumors the macrobeads are being used to treat.  Markers of the niche used to identify these cells and study their properties (numbers, integrity of surrounding blood vessels, degree of stress) will include HLA, CD44+, CD133+.  3.3 Rationale for Study Dosages  Based on the animal studies conducted to date, as well as the Phase I human trial that has been completed to date, a reasonable dosage range (number of beads to be implanted) is [ADDRESS_73450] with a single dose, this number was not seen to be any more effective than 8 macrobeads per kilogram.  As it is planned to carry out up to four implants (over 12 months) in this Phase II trial, each implantation will be carried out with the 8 macrobeads per kilogram dosage.

 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_73451]-treatment time points will be analyzed for some variables (such as tumor markers, for example). The confidence intervals for these changes will be calculated. Of course, it is not planned for the survival analysis.    Seventy-four (74) male and female subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer or metastatic, treatment-resistant colorectal cancer meeting all the above inclusion criteria will be recruited and treated for the study.  Baseline measurements will include tumor burden and size, tumor history and pathological diagnosis and grade, global clinical state, activities of daily living, symptom checklist including tumor-related symptoms, a sense-of-well-being scale, routine clinical biochemistry and any appropriate tumor markers as available, and an assessment of cellular and humoral immune status.   The primary tumor histopathology will be reviewed and will be evaluated with special staining to identify, if possible, the presence or absence of cancer stem cells and niche bodies.  The response of each subject to the intraperitoneal implantation of the RENCA agarose-agarose macrobeads will then be measured over the ensuing 3 months (and a 6, 9, and 12 months, if possible) with respect to changes in:   • Primary tumor size • Size or number of secondary/metastatic tumors • Tumor marker or relevant biochemical parameters such as liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase • Cellular or humoral immune status • Global clinical status or rating • Performance status (Karnofsky PS and ECOG PS) • Activities of daily living (ADL) rating • Symptom rating/severity (including use of pain medications) • Quality of life scale • Circulating tumor cells (when possible)

 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_73452] implant follow-up visits will be done in reference to the corresponding implantations i.e. Days 14, 30, 60 and 90 for each implantation.   4.2 Study Device/Biological Product  In this study, the study device/drug is the RENCA macrobead.  The cancer cell-containing agarose-agarose macrobeads that are to be used for the Phase II clinical trial are composed of two concentric spherical agarose layers.  The inner layer, which is also the layer in which the neoplastic cells (in this case, mouse renal adenocarcinoma cells) are embedded, is made up of 1.0% agarose.  The outer layer is composed of 5% agarose.  150,000 mouse renal adenocarcinoma (RENCA) cells are placed in each bead.  The diameter of the macrobead is 6,000-8,[ADDRESS_73453] a functional longevity of from 3 to 4 months.  The cancer-cell containing macrobead is derived from previous and currently ongoing work with a porcine-islet containing agarose-agarose macrobead, an IND for the human Phase I testing of which has been submitted to the FDA (IND # 9672, originally submitted April 9, 2001 and now continuing with further submissions to address the outstanding “clinical hold” issues).  This islet macrobead is described in detail in that IND and also in publications from our laboratory (Jain et al, 1995, 1999; Gazda, 2003, Gazda et al, 2005, Vinerean et al, 2008 contained in that IND).       The overall process of preparing the RENCA-cell-containing macrobead is described in the IND documents.  As for the islet macrobeads, the cancer macrobeads are placed in the peritoneal cavity in humans.  In the peritoneal cavity the beads should remain free (floating) in the intraperitoneal space.  They do not become vascularized and thus will remain as implants rather than true grafts.

 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_73454] be allowed to “mature” in vitro prior to their implantation into animals or humans willing to participate in the Phase II trial.  Although there is an early proliferation-inhibitory effect related to the apoptotic death of cancer cells in the macrobead, the effect of interest and therapeutic effectiveness is seen after approximately three weeks increasing to a maximum by [CONTACT_3450] 8-[ADDRESS_73455] coincides with dramatic changes in the tumors cells in the 1% agarose matrix.   The use of immunohistological and gene chip microarray techniques indicates that the cancer cells in the macrobeads undergo dramatic changes over the first several weeks of their encapsulation.  After 14-21 days, the cells begin to form ovoid colonies, which are characterized by [CONTACT_67355] (as indicated by a proliferation marker, Ki67) and growth inhibition (as indicated by [CONTACT_12127] p27, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which acts to inhibit cell proliferation at the G1-S checkpoint of the cell cycle).  Changes in the expression of genes involved in signal transduction and stem cell pathways are confirmatory of these dramatic changes in the cell populations within the bead. For example, they show decreased expression of genes related to DNA synthesis and angiogenesis (VEGF).  In sum, the colonies formed by [CONTACT_67356] a process marked by [CONTACT_67357].  The appearance of the cell-proliferation inhibitory effect coincides with the formation of the colonies. It should be emphasized again that RENCA cells removed from the colonies in the macrobeads after periods of up to [ADDRESS_73456] that there are likely to be multiple signals.  Based on the physical constraints of the 5% outer layer of agarose, the active product(s) must be less than [ADDRESS_73457] on the growth of non-constrained tumor cells.

Response assessment will be measured in terms of changes in volume of primary tumor and number of metastases as assessed by [CONTACT_462]; tumor marker PSA, as well as the physician global clinical assessment; performance rating scale (Karnofsky or similar); quality of subject life as measured by [CONTACT_67358]. Alkaline phosphatase and lactic dehydrogenase will also be followed.  Other laboratory determinations to monitor subject response to the implantation of the macrobeads will include detection of inflammatory responses (CBC with differential WBC and platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, amylase, immunological changes, and cytokine production), RT-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) specific to e-MuLV DNA, plasma viremia, and antibodies to normal murine antigens.    A critical and unique addition to the endpoints for assessing efficacy will be, where possible, a careful search for and identification of the niches of cancer stem and other cells within the niche bodies of the tumors the macrobeads are being used to treat.  Markers of the niche bodies used to identify them and study their state (numbers, integrity of surround blood vessels, degree of stress) will include HLA, CD44+, CD133+, p27, Ki67, and the Tunel assay for apoptosis, Determination of the presence or absence of circulating tumor cells will also be made.

If the data indicate that there are no contraindications to proceeding, on Day 0 (Day of Implantation), RENCA macrobeads (8 per kg body weight) will be implanted intraperitoneally.  5.1.4 Visit 1 / Study Day 0:  The day of implantation will be protocol Implant 1 / Study Day 0.  RENCA macrobeads (8 per kg body weight) will be implanted intraperitoneally. The subject will receive a small abdominal incision(s) utilizing laparoscopy, when possible, under general or local anesthesia, as indicated, and under sterile conditions in the operating rooms of [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307].  The location of the incision(s) will be at the surgeon’s discretion. Standard procedures call for the administration of [ADDRESS_73473]’s medical history (allergies or other condition).  Standard surgical procedures and three-layer closure of the abdominal wound, if possible, will be carried out.  Vital signs will be monitored as per routine for a post-laparoscopy subject and according to any special needs individual subjects may have. Assuming that the subject’s post-surgical condition is stable (as defined by [CONTACT_67359]-operative criteria) and that the subject is taking oral fluids and soft foods at a minimum, the subject will be discharged from surgical recovery room to either home care or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_67330]. Any other blood drawing or procedures will be those dictated by [CONTACT_67360].    If deemed medically and surgically safe by [CONTACT_67361], one or more biopsies of tumor mass will be taken during this procedure. Fresh frozen tissue and fixative-treated tissue will be sent to the laboratory for immunohistochemical and gene array analysis to determine baseline tumor histopathology and gene expression patterns.  5.1.5 Home Care:   Post-surgical home care requirements are expected to be minimal. Medical and wound care regimens will be carried out as individually prescribed by [CONTACT_67362]’s care.  The subject will complete a daily log of activity (ADL) and a general symptom checklist (defined subjectively), but with special emphasis on appetite, abdominal symptoms such as pain or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], bowel movements, urination (frequency,

Both the subject and her/his family members will be trained in the simple vital sign measurements and the filling in of the activity log/assessment and symptom checklist.  Vital signs will be measured twice daily at 8am and 8pm for the first month after implantation, then once a day for the next two months. The investigators may modify this schedule, if the clinical circumstances demand such modification.  Subject and family training will take place prior to macrobead implantation, with a review prior to discharge after implantation.   A critical safety parameter will be the determination of the presence or absence of antibody to murine viruses, including mouse leukemia virus (MuLV), as well as viral titers for murine viruses known to be infective for humans.  The published literature and the co-culture experiments carried out in our laboratory do not indicate that MuLV can infect human cells.  Furthermore, the RENCA cells used to prepare the cancer macrobead have tested negative for other known murine viruses (Charles River panel of 18 murine viruses).  In addition, none of the thirty-one (31) subjects treated to date in the Phase I study have shown any evidence of viral infection associated with the macrobeads. Nonetheless, this protocol includes laboratory and clinical monitoring for any such viral transmission.  If there is any laboratory or clinical evidence indicating or suggesting a viral infection with MuLV, all family members having direct physical contact [CONTACT_67363] a known or unknown viral infection.  Virological monitoring of all staff in contact [CONTACT_67364].

Symptoms of abnormal laboratory values and clinically significant asymptomatic laboratory values will constitute adverse events.  A medical condition that is present when the subject enters the study is not defined as an adverse event, unless this medical condition worsens after the study drug has been administered.  The Investigator, the safety physician of The Rogosin Institute, and the Safety Data Monitoring Board will be responsible for monitoring the safety parameters that are collected in the study.  As of their review of the safety/toxicity date from Phase I in June 2009, they found no adverse events attributable to the macrobeads.  The Safety Data Monitoring Board will independently review all safety parameters and safety results in the study.    The description of the adverse events will use the CTCAE v3.0 definitions (issued on December 12, 2003) to define the severity or intensity of the adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities.  The coding of the adverse events will use the most current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Agencies (MedDRA).  The coding will include reported term, preferred term, and classification of the System, Organ, Class (SOC).  The coding of concomitant medications will use the latest version of the WHO Drug Dictionary (WHODD).

The single dose (i.e., 8 macrobeads per kilogram) was previously shown to be well tolerated. In this study, the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is most likely to be related to the number of implantations rather than the number of macrobeads implanted at each implantation.   Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as

Furthermore, in 13 humans with end-stage cancer implanted with the macrobeads (up to 17 months), no serious adverse events have been recorded which can be attributed to the marcobeads. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the animals undergoing implantation have exhibited improved appetite, weight gain, and increased activity levels (the latter have been remarkable in at least one half of the animals treated).  Adverse reactions observed to date have been 1) mild-to-moderate intraperitoneal chronic inflammatory reaction evident after 3 months in cats and dogs, but not mice; and 2) entrapment of some macrobeads in the feline and canine omentum.  In the humans the reactions have been mild as well.  Some subjects have experienced mild, intermittent fevers after implantation (generally resolved by [CONTACT_67372]).

 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_73495] been implanted for periods of up to four years, this reaction becomes apparent beyond three months.  It consists of a minimal to moderate increase in inflammatory markers, with no disruption of normal physiological functions, such as those of intestinal peristalsis or biliary or pancreatic drainage/secretion.  Neither has it interfered with subsequent re-implantations of the RENCA macrobeads when indicated.  In humans, implantation has led to an increase in inflammatory markers, with intermittent, self- limiting, low grade fevers in some cases.  However, as observed in animals, the reactions were mild and not accompanied by [CONTACT_67373].  Comparison of the reaction to the RENCA macrobeads with that seen with the porcine islet agarose-agarose macrobeads implanted in mice, cats and dogs described in IND BB-IND 9762 submitted April 9, 2001, is useful. In these experiments porcine islet-containing macrobeads were implanted in mice, Wistar-Furth rats, cats, and dogs with both streptozotocin-induced and naturally occurring insulin-dependent diabetes and in a large series of normal (non-diabetic) Sprague-Dawley rats.  Beads have remained in some of the animals for long periods of time (in rats, 1 year; in cats for up to 6 years; and in dogs, over 3 years.)  One subject in the Phase I clinical trial had the macrobeads in place for 24 months without any evidence of adverse effects. No significant toxicity, other than the chronic inflammatory reaction, has occurred as documented by [CONTACT_67374], laboratory blood chemistry results, or histopathological analysis of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_67337].   Beyond macrobead removal (likely to be only partial (50-70%), but also not needed in any of the subjects treated with the macrobeads to date), whatever medical or surgical treatments are in the best interests of the subject and consistent with optimal medical care will be carried out with subject and/or family consent at any stage of the formal sixteen month protocol period and for the lifetime of the subject as the protocol indicates   A second potential adverse effect of the implantation of the RENCA macrobeads is the transmission of a murine virus to a human host. Theoretically, this could involve transmission of the virus to the subject without infection; clinically significant infection; and infection of a third party via exposure to the beads or to the potentially infected subject.  Such risks are greatly reduced by [CONTACT_67375], including those that present a possible risk of infection for humans.  Although the RENCA cell line does require passing through Balb/c mice approximately three times a year to maintain its tumorigenicity, the mice used for this passing are from Charles River Laboratories, are pathogen-free to the most stringent possible standards, and are

 Version: Amendment 11   CONFIDENTIAL   Page 55 of 77 November 12th 2014           maintained under strictly controlled animal care conditions.  Furthermore, the passing process itself is carried out in the Rogosin laboratories under sterile conditions.  The RENCA cells are routinely tested for microbiological contaminants during their maintenance in culture as well as after their incorporation into the agarose-agarose macrobeads so that the risk of their carrying any known infectious agent is eliminated.  Clinical monitoring of the approximately 500 mice, cats and dogs treated to date, furthermore, has given no indication of any viral or other infection related to the implantation of the macrobeads.   The only virus identified to date in the RENCA cell line is the ecotropic (non-xenotropic) variant of the murine leukemia virus (MLV), an endogenous retrovirus that is not known to infect human cells.  Literature reports (National Research Council, 1991) of its lack of ability to infect human cells have been confirmed in our laboratory using a standard co-culture protocol (for up to 30 days) with human 293, an embryonic kidney cell line.  Thus, there is no evidence that this murine retrovirus variant poses any threat to humans.  In the 30 subjects in the Phase I clinical trial there has been no evidence to date of the transmission of or infection with the MuLV.  Risks associated with the surgical procedure (including anesthesia) required for the implantation of the RENCA macrobeads will be those normally expected for such a procedure involving a simple abdominal incision.  They will be dependent, of course, on individual subject risk factors, but no subjects with unacceptable risks for such a procedure will be admitted to this study.  The performance of the abdominal incision and the placement of the macrobeads in the peritoneal cavity are both simple and minimally invasive.  Allergic reaction to mouse antigens is a potential risk.  With respect to this risk the following procedures will be in place:  All subjects eligible for this protocol will be screened with available mouse allergen extracts using intradermal skin testing (Greer Diagnostics) initially to determine if a wheal and flare reaction is present, indicating the presence of human anti-mouse antibody.  Positive and negative skin test controls will be done at the same time.  Data from repeated implantations of mouse RENCA macrobeads in dogs and cats with spontaneously occurring tumors of various types have not provided any clinical or laboratory evidence of sensitization to mouse proteins over periods of up to four years.  It should also be noted that, over the period of 4 to 6 months after a given implant, the RENCA cells in the macrobeads die so that there is not an ongoing production of antigenic substances by [CONTACT_67376].  The agarose itself has been well tolerated (except for local foreign body reaction) for periods of up to several years in studies with porcine islet macrobeads and for

The beads have been tolerated without evidence of adverse reaction in humans now for up to [ADDRESS_73496] in the protocol develop evidence of sensitization to mouse proteins, appropriate local and systemic therapy (antihistamines, steroids) will be given.  If the reaction is medically manageable, it should not be necessary to remove the RENCA macrobeads, given the gradual loss of cells within these beads.  Should the reaction not be amenable to medical treatment removal of the beads will be performed via an open procedure, although complete retrieval may not be surgically possible (see below).

The events or findings that would initiate such considerations/discussion include, but are not limited to:  • Any finding of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) as defined above;  • Evidence of active e-MuLV viral infection in subject’s cells/serum/plasma (i.e., transmission of MuLV from the mouse cells to the subject with active infection productive of a viral load in the subject);  • Chronic peritonitis reaction > grade 3.  Although not specifically defined per se in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0, several of the subcategories under the Gastrointestinal section are applicable.  The GI-Other sub-category will be used: Peritonitis/Chronic Inflammatory Reaction.  Grade 1: Asymptomatic; radiographic (flat plate, CT, or MRI) or ultrasound imaging of peritoneal reaction.  Grade 2: Symptomatic: abdominal pain or tenderness or pain on palpation (direct, rebound); altered dietary habits (i.e., appetite, fluid intake); requirement or IV fluids <24 hours indicated; altered bowel function (mild constipation or diarrhea).  Grade 3: Symptomatic and severely altered GI function (e.g., inadequate oral caloric or fluid intake); IV fluids, tube feedings, or TPN indicated > 24hours.  Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences.  Any toxicity of Grade 2 or above as defined above in relation to the NCI CTCAE v3.0 or DLT, as defined immediately above, will initiate discussion of the possibility/ desirability/ necessity of the removal of the RENCA macrobeads.  Any such discussion will necessarily involve multiple considerations including the

 Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_73499]’s primary or attending physician, relevant consultants, and the Safety Board as appropriate, with notification of the IRB and the FDA. It should be noted and emphasized that it will not be possible to remove all of the macrobeads. 50 to 80% removal is likely to be possible, but the exact level of removal of macrobeads that is achievable will depend on many factors, most importantly the subject’s overall health status and best medical interests.  Again, the removal of any macrobeads has not been warranted in any of the humans implanted with them thus far.  6.[ADDRESS_73500].

Various markers, such as C-reactive protein, amylase, liver function tests, cell counts, and cytokine levels, will be sampled and analyzed.  Given the study design, we will undertake simple population comparisons designed for small samples (non-normal distribution) as well as simple trend analysis for selected parameters.  The data from all subjects, including those who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will be analyzed.  All data will be analyzed using SAS software.  7.1  Determination of Sample Size  Seventy-four (74) male and female subjects with advanced pancreatic or metastatic, treatment-resistant colorectal cancer meeting the protocol inclusion criteria will be sought for this study.  Each subject will serve as his/her own control with measurements obtained and evaluated in an unbiased manner. This means that changes from baseline to various post-treatment time points will be analyzed for some variables (such as tumor markers, for example). The confidence intervals for these changes will be calculated. Of course, it is not planned for the survival analysis which will use a retrospective patient population comparison as defined in the Statiscal Analysis Plan (a copy of which is attached). The colorectal patient data from this study has already been used to plan a controlled Phase IIb protocol for colorectal cancer. Data from the pancreatic patients, when completed, will be utilized to plan a phase IIb controlled protocol for the pancreatic patients.  7.[ADDRESS_73501]’s baseline established prior to the first implantation will be used for the entire study.  A table will be constructed using the changes from baseline.

Study design  Study [PHONE_1600] is an open-label, non-randomized, single-center Phase II trial of RENCA agarose-agarose macrobeads.  The study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of this new treatment for subjects with treatment-resistant pancreatic adenocarcinoma or colorectal cancer.  The study will enroll a total of [ADDRESS_73516] signs an Informed Consent and is not implanted, the subjects will not be classified as evaluable and will be replaced.   These subjects will be classified as screen failures.  All efficacy and safety analyses will be by [CONTACT_67380]-type, that is, pancreatic and colorectal subjects will be evaluated separately with no formal between group comparisons.  Analyses will be performed with a focus on an estimation of specific clinically important parameters for use in the planning of larger subsequent Phase IIb and/or Phase III trials designed to fully assess efficacy and safety.  There will be no formal interim statistical analysis.  The amount and nature of missing data will be characterized and no method of imputation will be used for missing data.  All statistical analyses will be carried out using SAS version 9.2 (or higher) statistical software.   2. Study objectives   All study objectives, as detailed in Section 3 of the protocol, will be assessed in each of the two study groups to be enrolled in this clinical trial: subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer and subjects with advanced colorectal cancer.    3. Accrual  The projected accrual is approximately 3 subjects per month and therefore recruitment is expected to be completed at about 12 months following the study starting point.

One of the sub-analyses will include efficacy response after one, two, three, and/or four implantations.    All evaluable subjects enrolled in the study who complete at least one implantation procedure will be included in the safety population and considered evaluable for toxicity and safety.  The efficacy and safety populations do not differ.  All treatment related toxicities will be recorded and then tabulated at the end of the study.  All treatment related toxicities will be recorded and then tabulated at the end of the study.    Screen Failures All subjects who sign an Informed Consent but for any reason are not implanted will be considered screen failures.  These subjects will be listed and the reasons for not being implanted listed and described.    5. Descriptive analyses  Measured outcome variables will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_67381].  Descriptive statistics such as frequencies and relative frequencies will be computed for all categorical variables. Numeric variables will be summarized using simple descriptive statistics such as the mean, standard deviation and range.  A variety of graphical techniques will also be used to display data, for example, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, etc.     6. Primary statistical analyses  The primary objectives are outlined in Section 3 of this protocol. The analysis will be performed as detailed in Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).   7.

As can be seen there does exist acceptable properties associated with the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].   9. Sample size justification  Since the primary objectives are addressed through estimation and not formal hypothesis testing, the original sample size of 20 colorectal subjects and 10 pancreatic subjects was based on the expected precision corresponding to the estimates of the progression at appropriate intervals and toxicity rates.  We believe that these statistical goals will be fulfilled with the current intended sample size of 74 patients, of which, 40 patients will be pancreatic cancer type. The precision associated with these estimates is a function of the true unknown parameter value and the sample size used in the calculation.  Note that a true rate of 50% represents the worst case scenario with in regards to precision and therefore we may take precision at that point to be an upper bound of expected accuracy in the estimation of study parameters.  Calculations reveal that the precision associated with estimates based on the colorectal subjects will be at most 22 percentage points.  In the case of pancreatic subjects, the corresponding quantity is 31 percentage points.

This study has been rev ised to allow for maximal social distancing in order to expedite 
the study time line , minimize risk of COVID19 exposure,  and ensure participant safety.   
  
The Latino population over age 65 will reach 18% of the total U.S. population by 2050. 
Currently, ove r 12% of older adult Latinos have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s 
disease and related dementias (ADRD). Even more striking, the number of Latinos with 
ADRD is expected to increase [ADDRESS_582740] older Latinos at a high risk for loss of independence and significan t 
caregiver burden. Sedentary time (defined as sitting) has been shown to be associated 
with reduced cogn itive function in healthy older Latinos. Studies are clearly needed to 
investigate the benefits on cognition and brain connectivity of breaking up and replacing 
sedentary time with physical activity (PA) in older Latinos. However, in order to develop 
and d eliver a successful intervention we need to  understand how to best conduct a 
lifestyle intervention in the Latino community . Our current understanding is rooted in a 
Eurocentric view that assumes that interventions that work in one community will work 
the same way in a different community. This assumption is likely incorrect and 
represents a significant gap in our ability to develop a successful interven tion at the 
multiple l levels that are required across the socio -ecological model (SEM) to be 
successful.  We propose to investigate the interactive effects of behavior determination 
to increase PA levels in older Latinos.  This study will examine factors t hat facilitate 
initiation of and adherence to behavioral change at the individual level using the social 
cognitive theory, and ecological momentary assessment in an inner -city Chicago Latino 
Senior community. Our objectives  are: 1) to discern the individua l characteristics and 
the social networks within the community that influence behavior change to increase  PA 
levels in the Latino community. 2) To assess the feasibility and acceptability of our PA 
measures. 3) To test the feasibility and initial impact of  an intervention program 
designed to replace sedentary time with PA that has been designed specifically f or older 
Latinos and delivered at home, to improve cognitive function and brain connectivity. We 
will achieve these objectives by [CONTACT_455844] s, ecological momentary 
assessment, and an ecological momentary intervention within an inner city Chicago  
Latino senior community. Findings will directly facilitate the development and 
progression of culturally appropriate intervention(s) that will lead to  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_455818]. This proposal  is 
very relevant to ADRD and aging research  and addresses several areas of focus. 1). 
Physical Activity promotion, creation, modification and pi[INVESTIGATOR_455819] a principle -based 
intervention to reduce sedentary behavior and increase physical activity. 2). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_455820]. 3). We are harnessing 
technology to promote and sustain  a behavioral intervention to achieve healt hy aging in 
older adults.

Page 7 of 26 [8-10-2021 ] 2.0 Background/Scientific Rationale  
The Latino population over age 65 will comprise 18% of the total U.S. population by 
2050. Currently, over 12% of older adult Latinos have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s 
disease and related d ementias (ADRD) . Even more striking, the number of Latinos with 
ADRD is expected to increase [ADDRESS_582741] older Latin os at a high risk for loss of independence and significant 
caregiver burden. Sedentary time (defined as sitting) is a known risk factor  for reduced 
cognitive function in healthy older Latinos . Studies are clearly n eeded to investigate the 
benefits on cognition and brain connectivity of breaking up and replacing sedentary time 
with physical activity (PA) in this p opulation. However, in order to develop and deliver a 
successful intervention we need to  understand how t o best conduct a lifestyle 
intervention in the Latino community . We propose to investigate the interactive effects of 
behavior determination to increas e PA levels in this population.  This study will examine 
factors that facilitate initiation of and adhere nce to behavioral change at the individual 
level using social cognitive theory, and ecological momentary assessment in an inner -
city Chicago Latino Sen ior community.  
 
3.0 Objectives/Aims  
 
Successful lifestyle interventions must act on multiple levels acro ss the SEM in order to 
in order to increase daily physical activity. The SEM underscores the importance of 
understanding how the individual and the ind ividual’s interpersonal community affect 
behavior change. Our long-term goal  is to develop an interventio n that is specifically 
tailored to older Latinos to prevent or forestall cognitive and physical function decline . 
Specifically, we propose to investiga te the interactive effects of behavior determination 
to increase physical activity (PA) levels in older L atinos. Our objectives  are  
 
1) to discern the individual characteristics and the social network within the community that 
influence behavior change to in crease PA levels in an inner city Chicago Latino 
community.  
2) To assess the feasibility and acceptabili ty of our PA measures.  
3) To test the feasibility of an intervention designed to replace sedentary time with 
PA that has been designed specifically for  older Latinos and delivered in their homes to 
improve cognitive function . 
 
• Aim 1 (stage 1A):  Conduct individual phone interviews  to determine the individual 
characteristics and the social networks that influence behavior change to reduce and 
replace seden tary time with PA within an older adult Chicago Latino community. The 
focus groups will be 50% male and 5 0% female to enable comparisons of possible 
gender -differences.   
• Aim 2 (stage 1A):  Assess the feasibility and acceptability of our PA measures and 
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in this community.  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
A Physical Activity Program to Disrupt the Sedentary Time in Older Latinos  Version [10.0] 
Page 8 of 26 [8-10-2021 ] • Aim 3 (stage 1B):  Determine the feasibility and acc eptability of an ecological 
momentary intervention (EMI) program designed to reduce and replace sedentary time 
with PA in older Latinos, delivered in t he home -setting over 6 weeks, compared to 
participants randomized to receive physical activity guidelines  in Spanish.  
• Exploratory aims (stage 1B):  To explore the feasibility and preliminary effect of the 
EMI intervention on cognitive function in  older Lati nos, compared to participants 
randomized to guidelines.  
 
Study Duration:  This is a feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_455821], controlled trial of a 6 -week 
intervention. Outcome measures will be obtained at baseline and at 6 -weeks. Behavior 
choices and preference data will be continuously captured during the intervention.

5.[ADDRESS_582742] established 
strong relationship with this organization and key stakeholders.  Participants will be 
recruited through a flyer with information about the study posted on organization’s  
website and by [CONTACT_6063]. We have developed a  media recruitment script that will 
be used as the script for a video presentation  that will be  poste d on a website, TV add, 
Facebook, and read as a radio add.  We will send a notice via the CCTS research ma tch 
and the TNN Match service using the form titled “research match” .   
• Participants  that contact [CONTACT_455845] n as 
much time as they feel necessary to decide if they would like to participate.  Participants  
will be encouraged to ask any questions at any time throughout the course of the study.  
Research personnel will be available to answer these questions. Subjec ts will be 
informed that participating in this research is voluntary. Subjects will be informed that 
they may withdraw from the research at any time without penalty. Patient providers are 
not part of the study team.  
 
6.0 Study Design and Procedures  
 
This research will be performed via telephone/ video conference to maximize social 
distancing  and participant s afety . The intervention will be performed by [CONTACT_2299] s 
at home.  
 
This is a  pi[INVESTIGATOR_47669], controlled trial of a 6 -week intervention for feas ibility. 
Outcome measures will be obtained at baseline and at 6 -weeks. Behavior choices and 
preference da ta will be continuously captured during the intervention. We will randomize 
80 older Latinos from the Chicago Latino community to either an ecological momentary 
intervention using fitbits (n= 40) or to physical activity guidelines (n= 40).  
 
Study interactio n 1-baseline test (Approximately 2 hours). Participants will be screened 
for inclusion/exclusion criteria. If criteria for inclusion in the study are m et participants 
will undergo informed consent process. Following informed e-consent conducted via 
zoom vi deo/telephone participant s will asked about their demographics (demographic 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
A Physical Activity Program to Disrupt the Sedentary Time in Older Latinos  Version [10.0] 
Page 10 of 26 [8-10-2021 ] form), and contact [CONTACT_3031] (Face sheet), and then they will be asked ab out their 
medical history. Following the medical history we will fill out the Charlson co -morbidity 
quest ionnaire, and conduct the following cognitive function measures as approved by 
[CONTACT_455846] : a. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_343823], b. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] s equence test, c. List 
sorting test, d. Oral reading recognition test, e. Auditory verbal learning test , and the 
Trail Making test A and B . Following the cognitive function testing, we will conduct a 
phone /video  interview. The interview will be recorded, an alyzed and used to develop the 
intervention.  
 
Following the interview we will conclude the phone call an d send the participants an 
activity monitor to be worn on the waist for 8 days to measure sedentary time: The 
participants will mail the monitor back t o us after [ADDRESS_582743] received the 
physical activity monitor we will randomize the participant to intervention or control.  
 
Optional in -person visit (approximately 1 hour) If the participant is willing and 
able to undergo an MRI scan.  No contras t will be used.   
• The MRI Visit will take place about one -week after the initial phone call.  
Participants  will come to the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Center, 3T 
research center [ADDRESS_582744]. Chicago IL 60612and return the 
actigraph to us.  We will a sk participants to do the following:  
•  Have an MRI to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_455822] a scanning facility. S canning 
will last approximately 1 hour during.  
• Before entering the MRI room, participants will be asked to remove from all 
metal objects, including jew elry, watches, hair holders, or eyeglasses; and 
asked to empty pockets of all materials, including keys, wallets, and 
magnetic cards such as ATM and credit cards. In addition, if the clothing 
has more than a minimal amount of metal content, they may be ask ed to 
change into a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455823]. Finally, they may be 
asked to remove any eye  shadow you may be wearing, because eye 
shadow sometimes contains metallic substances.  
• Because the MRI machine makes loud noises while it scans, a rese archer 
or technician will provide participants with earplugs to reduce the noise 
level.  
• All of the proce dures described above will be performed by [CONTACT_3784], 
licensed personnel and arranged at the participant’s convenience. We will 
inform participants of any abnormalities found in the tests; however, the 
information obtained from the MRI and cognitive testin g is experimental in 
nature and does not allow for clinical interpretation. We will, however, 
contact [CONTACT_455847] a formal 
clinical follow -up and discuss this with their medical provider (e.g., General

with a do ctor for a clinical evaluation  
 
Following the MRI, we will assess cogniti ve and basic motor function using the 
NIH toolbox  the NIH Toolbox measures for Cognitive function will co mpleted 
using the standard NIH Ipad (see administration manual):

• C.2.[ADDRESS_582748] page 151  
• C.2.[ADDRESS_582749] NIH Ipad (see ad ministration manual):  
• Pegboard dexterity test  (172)  
• Balance measures with the addition of iPod app for assessment of sway  
(179) . 
• Two-minute walk  (198)  
• Grip strength (using handheld dynamometer , 176 ) 
• 4 meter walk  (195)  
 
Study interaction 2 (Approximately 1 hour) : Participants will be notified via telephone 
which group that were randomized to.  
 
Participants randomized to the intervention group will be sen t a fitbit that has been set 
up to deliver the intervention as described below. We will schedule a teleph one call or 
zoom video call (whichever the participant prefers) to set up the HIPPA compliant EMA 
system and to provide education about the fitbit and the intervention to disrupt 
sedentary time.  
 
Intervention (home -setting) : We will deliver content in rea l-time, and in the real -world 
environment using a wearable sensor, an activity tracker and the Illumivu mEMA smart 
phone app, which will enable real -time delivery of behavior options and real -time 
feedback on the effectiveness of behavior choices. Although  the intervention will be 
guided by [CONTACT_455848], in general, participants will wear a Fitbit that has been 
programmed to deliver a notificat ion (a buzz) when activity has ceased for more than [ADDRESS_582750] 
sitting time with PA such as standing up 5 times or taking 20 steps, or even performing 
a short (20 seconds) preferred d ance routine. We will capture Fitbit data in a real -time 
platform (ICardia). Participants will receive re minders from their smartphones to enter 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
A Physical Activity Program to Disrupt the Sedentary Time in Older Latinos  Version [10.0] 
Page 12 of 26 [8-10-2021 ] real-time feedback on activity options selected and how successful they were in 
adopting the option. These data  will allow us to track underlying preferences for 
behaviors and tailor the program accordingly. Particip ants will receive a message 
immediately with positive choices for behavioral action. Resulting actions and delivery of 
the intervention will be automat ically captured and downloaded in real time.  We will 
teach them how to use these devices once they are as signed to the intervention group. 
The sensor and activity tracker will record their everyday physical activity level. When 
participant stays sedentary too long during a day, the smartphone app will send a real -
time reminder with some physical activity opti ons for participant to choose designed 
based on their preferences and focus group discussions (e.g., standing up 5 times, 
taking 20 steps, or performin g a short dance routine). Resulting actions and delivery of 
the intervention will be automatically captur ed and downloaded into the devices in real 
time.  
 
Participants randomized to the control group will be sent general guidelines for 
disruption of sedent ary time.  
 
Study interaction 3 -Follow -up (Approximately 1 hour):  At the completion of the [ADDRESS_582751] for 8 days to measure sedentary time: The participants will mail  the monitor back 
to us after [ADDRESS_582752] received the physical activity monitor we will schedul e 
a phone interview with the participants to understand where they had difficulty and what 
did or did not work for them. We will then repeat the cognit ive function tests  and the 
optional MRI scan .  
 
7.0 Expected Risks/Benefits  
Risk associated with the medi cal history assessment  
Discomfort could be felt by [CONTACT_455849].  
Risk associated with the cognitiv e function questionnaires.  
There is a slight risk that participants will feel uncomfortable with filling  out the 
questionnaires. Participants could find answering the questions boring and/or tiring. We 
will monitor the progress and allow participants to t ake breaks as needed. If they 
become upset or uncomfortable, they may skip a given question.  
 
Optional MR I scans:  
The MRI scans are performed with a powerful magnet without using x -ray radiation or 
radioactive material. The magnetism of the machine attrac ts certain metals, which could 
put a participant  at risk. Therefore, people with pacemakers, infusion pum ps, metal

Page 13 of 26 [8-10-2021 ] prostheses, metallic -backed transdermal patches or metallic shrapnel will be excluded 
from the study.  A checklist will be completed that add resses issues of MRI safety. 
Some people may feel somewhat closed -in (claustrophobic) during the MRI proc edure. 
The MRI scans can get quite noisy and this may cause some discomfort. We will 
provide padding, a blanket as well as ear plugs to ensure comfort.  Participants  will stay 
in contact [CONTACT_455850].  
There are no known risks associated with activities to break up sedentary time as they 
are consi dered usual activities of daily living.  
 
8.0 Data Collection and Management Procedures  
• We will use EMI d esigned to deliver content in real -time, and in the real -world 
environment. EMI, using a wearable sensor, an activity tracker and the Illumivu mEMA 
smart phone app, will enable real -time delivery of behavior options and real -time 
feedback on the effectiven ess of behavior choices. This methodology will enable us to 
create a culturally appropriate intervention that is based on preferences of individuals 
within their community networks.  Although the intervention will be guided by [CONTACT_455851], in general, we expect that participants will wear a Fitbit that has been 
programmed to deliver a notification (a buzz) when activity has ceased for more t han [ADDRESS_582753] ace sitting time with PA such as standing up 5 times or taking 20 steps, or 
even performing a short preferred dance routine. We will capture Fitbit dat a in a real -
time platform (ICardia). Participants will receive reminders from their smartphones to 
enter real-time feedback on the PA options selected and how successful they were in 
adopting the option. These data will allow us to track underlying prefere nces for 
behaviors and tailor the program accordingly. Participants will receive a message 
immediately wi th positive choices for behavioral action. Resulting actions and delivery of 
the intervention will be automatically captured and downloaded in real tim e.  
 
• Outcomes:  Sedentary time  will be measured using the Actigraph, a validated tool for 
measuring sedent ary time in older adults following standard procedures over 7 days at 
baseline a nd at follow up. Sedentary behavior will be defined as: 1) waking activ ity with 
an energy expenditure ≤ 1.5 metabolic equivalents occurring in a sitting or reclining 
posture; 2) vector magnitude counts are <70 counts/15 -s and vertical axis counts are 
<10 c ounts/15 -s. Sedentary interruption will be defined as counts >100/minut e. Non -
wear time will be considered to be [ADDRESS_582754] be available to be included in the analysis.  
 
• Cognitive and Physical Function Measures will be assessed using the NIH Toolbox 
measures.

• Feasibility and acceptability : We will conduct formative assessments at the 
completion of the intervention at week 6. We will derive the number of times the  phone 
app was accessed and the number and types of behavior choices th at were made. We 
will review these data with participants in order to understand where they had difficulty 
and what did or did not work for them.  
 
9.0 Data Analysis  
• We will conduct a t hematic analysis to explore themes from individual phone interviews. 
Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed using descriptive and non -parametric 
statistics. Exploratory analyses will be conducted to assess for trends and effect sizes. 
[CONTACT_455871] ffen of the College of Nursing statistician will conduct all analyses. The 
apriori stated analysis is listed below.  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_455825] . For these pi[INVESTIGATOR_455826], standard deviations, eff ect sizes, medians, interquartile 
ranges, frequencies, and percentages to demonstrate the feasibility of recruitment, 
adherence, and retention, treatment effects over time, and proof of concept.  Our 
statistical approach for a full trial of these hypothese s will be Generalized Linear Mixed 
Models (GLMM) with an identity link function for a continuous outcome or a logit link 
function for a binary outcome.  Conceptually, GLMM is a more advanced version of 
repeated measures ANOVA that can account for potential  correlation among multiple 
measurements over time while having flexibi lity in fitting outcomes with different 
distributions (such as normal, binomial or Poisson, etc.). One advantage of this 
approach over repeated measures ANOVA is that there is no assump tion that 
participants are measured at every, or even the same, time po ints. Therefore, these 
models are very flexible at handling missing data. Participants who have a missing 
observation are not excluded, thus, this produces the intention to treat (ITT) full 
information maximum likelihood (FIML) model.  Conducting these mod els on pi[INVESTIGATOR_455827] a future R01 submission.

Page 16 of 26 [8-10-2021 ] back for the follow -up tests.  I f the subject does not want to complete the study, no 
further contact [CONTACT_455852] (this will be reported at the annual  continuing review).  
 
Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Collecti on and Reporting  
Adverse events will be tracked on an ongoing basis for the full sample using an adapted 
version of the NIA Adverse Event Form ( https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical -
research -study -investigators -toolbox/adverse -events ) and serious adverse events will 
be tracked using the NIH Serious Adverse Event For m 
(https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical -research -study -investigators -
toolbox/adverse -events ). Adverse events will be reviewed durin g semi -annual meetings 
of the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (see 3.0  below for details). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_455829] (Chair of the Committee) within 24 hours of notification.  In addition, adverse 
events and serious adverse events will be reporte d to the UIC IRB and NIA consistent 
with their established protocols and will use the NIA AE/SAE Flow Process to guide this 
process and timeline ( https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical -research -study -
investigators -toolbox/adverse -events ). 
AEs will be defined as any health -related event that occurs within the interven tion or 
assessment measure sessions. Expected AEs may include strained or sore muscles 
and fatigue. AE severity will be classified as:  
• Mild - if the symptoms are tolerated and do not interfere with the participant’s 
daily life.  
• Moderate – if the symptoms cause some concern or some disruption to the 
participant’s daily life, but can be alleviated through rest or relatively simple non -
medical intervention.  
• Severe – if the symptoms cause a major disruption in their daily life and require 
medical intervention or drug therapy.  
All AEs will be documented using the Adverse Event For m by [CONTACT_978]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_455830]. The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_455831]. 
All AEs will be reported to the DSMC and IRB i n accordance with reporting guidelines.  
SAEs are not expected to occur within this intervention. However, potential SAEs could 
be a serious injury related to the intervention, a cardiac  event resulting from physical 
activity, and death. All SAEs will be do cumented in the Serious Adverse Event form and 
reported to the NIA program officer and Safety Officer within [ADDRESS_582757] Study Risks.  
Informed Consent Process .  Potential participants will be provided with a copy of the 
consent form approved by [CONTACT_455853] o wn. A member of the research team will fully describe the study to the 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
A Physical Activity Program to Disrupt the Sedentary Time in Older Latinos  Version [10.0] 
Page 17 of 26 [8-10-2021 ] potential participant(s) verbally, covering all of the content in the consent form, including 
potential risks and benefits. Potential participants will be given time to read the consent  
form and invited to ask any questions they may have about the study.  Questions will be 
answered and any identified misunderstandings about the study will be clarified. 
Individuals interested in participating at this point will be asked to sign the e -cons ent 
and will be provided with one copy for their use. The standard cons ent form template 
used by [CONTACT_455854] ( https://www.nia.n ih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical -research -study -

Protections Against Study Risk. We believe that the potential risks to participants in this 
study  are minimal and are risks that anyone disrupting sedentary time  is likely to 
experience. There may be a small risk of muscle soreness associated with increased 
physical activity. Participants will be encouraged to (a) consult their health care provider 
before initiating any new physical activity; and (b) perform physical act ivities at a pace 
that is comfortable for them and in a way that is consistent with any recommendations 
from their medical provider.  
Special care will be taken to ensure confidentialit y of all data  as described above . All 
project staff will be required to  be current in training in Human Research Subjects 
protection sponsored by [CONTACT_455855]. The staff will also receive 
additional training on confidentiality by t he principal investigator.  
 
We do not anticipate any serious adverse e vents or distress as a result of participating 
in the proposed research. Any concerns will be immediately reported the principal 
investigator.  
 
Interim Analysis  will not be performed . The pi[INVESTIGATOR_455832] 6 weeks. The 
assessments will occur on  two occasions (i.e., baseline; immediately post -intervention), 
so there will not be an opportunity to do an interim analysis during this short term pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480].  
 
Data and Safety monito ring.  
 
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_455833] (PI) will be responsible for en suring participants' safety 
on a daily basis. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_455834] a local Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee and Safety Officer that will not require approval by [CONTACT_6059]. The S afety 
Officer in conjunction with a Data Safety Monitoring Roybal Cente r Committee will act in 
an advisory capacity to the NIA Director to monitor participant safety, evaluate the 
progress of the study, to review procedures for monitoring the confidentiali ty of the data, 
the quality of data collection matter, management, and analyses.  
 
Frequency of Data and Safety Monitoring/ Safety Officer (SO) Reports.

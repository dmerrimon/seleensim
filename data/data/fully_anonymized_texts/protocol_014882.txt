Study Title:  Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo- Controlled Trial of the Efficacy and Safety of Intranasal Oxytocin 
for the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder  
NIAAA Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_566015], Ph.D.  
Study Center s: [LOCATION_011] University Medical Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, University of 
[LOCATION_004] at Los Angeles , and University of Virginia  
Study Period:  ~ 12 months Phase of Development:  2 
Objectives:  
Primary:  The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of intranasal oxytocin in reducing the 
weekly percentage of heavy drinking days over the 10 weeks of maintenance treatment  among subjects  with 
moderate to severe Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). A “heavy drinking day” is 4 or more drinks per drinking day for 
women and 5 or more drinks per drinking day for men.   
Secondary:  Secondary objectives include assessment of other measures of the effects of oxytocin compared with 
placebo on reduction of alcohol  use as well as effects on psychological assessments, alcohol craving, alcohol -related 
consequences, cigarette smoking and other nicotine use , retention in the study, safety, and application site (nares) 
tolerability throughout the study . 
Methodology:  This study is a double -blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, parallel group, multi- site clinical trial 
designed to assess the efficacy of oxytocin compared with placebo to reduce drinking in 100 subjects ( 50 in each 
group) who report 4 or more Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fifth Edition (DSM -5™) 
symptoms of AUD. This study will be conducted at 4 clinical sites. If eligible for the study, subjects will be 
randomized using a stratified permuted block randomization procedure with “clinical site” as a stratification variable 
in an approximate 1:1 ratio (targeting 50 subjects per group) to receive either intranasal oxytocin or placebo for 12 
weeks. 
If eligible for the study, subjects will receive blinded intranasal oxytocin a t 35 IU once per day or intranasal placebo 
(same volume once per day) for 2 weeks  (initial tolerability assessment period) , then for the next 10 weeks 
(maintenance period) subjects will receive oxytocin at 35  IU/ twice per day (BID, totally daily dose 70 I U) or 
intranasal placebo (same volume twice per day).  
Subjects will be seen in the clinic at screening  visit(s) , at randomization and 7 other times during the study (Weeks 
2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 13). During the Weeks 5 , 7, 9, 11, and 12 subjects will be contact[CONTACT_566054]- clinic visit weeks to encourage study drug compliance and to assess withdrawal, adverse events 
(AEs), and concomitant medication  use. A final follow -up telephone interview will occur during Weeks 14 /15 (1-to-
2 weeks after the end of dosing).  
Enrollment will be halted if more than 2 treatment- related SAEs occur.  If  this occurs, a  DSMB will be convened 
and a decision in conjunction with the study Sponsor will be made regarding stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098].    
Number of Subjects ( Planned): Estimated 250 to obtain 100 eligible and randomized.  
Main Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:  Subjects will be male and female at least 21  years of age with 4 or more 
DSM -5™ symptoms of AUD. They must also be seeking treatment for alcohol problems  and if male, report drinking 
an average of [ADDRESS_743469] one in the 7 -day period prior to 
randomization.  
Oxytocin for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) [ADDRESS_743470], Dosage and Mode of Administration:  Oxytocin, 35 I U per dose, intranasally once -daily  
for 2 weeks then twice -daily ( BID) (morning and evening) for 10 weeks . Oxytocin is formulated to contain 70  
IU/mL.  One dose is defined as intranasal  spray  of 100 μL  per each nostril x 5 sprays in alternating nostrils  with a 30 
second wait between sprays for a total dose volume of 500 μL.  
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  Identically match ed placebo  administered  intranasally 
once -daily for 2 weeks then BID (morning and evening) for 10 weeks. The placebo spray is formulated identically to 
oxytocin without the addition of oxytocin. One dose is defined as intranasal spray  of 0.1 mL per each nostril x 5 
sprays in alternating nostrils with a 30 second wait between sprays for a total dose of 0. 5 mL. 
Duration of Study:  Each subject will participate in the  study for up to approximately 17 weeks , including up to 2 
weeks of screening, 12 weeks of treatment  (2 weeks for initial tolerability and 10 weeks of maintenance dosing for 
safety and efficacy) , one follow -up visit after completing treatment, and a final telephone contact 1- to- 2 weeks after 
completing treatment. 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Primary : The primary efficacy endpoint is th e weekly percentage of heavy drinking days during the 10-week

Statistical Methods (Data Analysis):  
Analysis Populations:  
Full Analysis Set:  The full analysis set is defined as subjects randomized to participate in the study who took at 
least one dose of investigational product.  The full analysis set will be used to evaluate all efficacy and safety 
endpoints.  
Sample Size:  With an  intake sample of 1 00 subjects ( 50 subjects per arm) and 1 2% attrition, it is projected that the 
sample size for primary endpoint analyses will be 88 ( 44 subjects per arm). The alpha level for the primary analyses 
will be 0.05, two -tailed. An estimate of the effect size (Cohen’s d) for the investigational products is 0. 60. Equal 
variances in both groups are assumed. These assumptions lead to a projected power of 0.80.  
Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  The analysis of the primary endpoint , percentag e of heavy drinking 
days,  will be a mixed -effect model for repeated measures  during the last 10 weeks of the treatment period . 
Treatment group, study week, treatment group by [CONTACT_82522], clinical site and baseline percentage of 
heavy drinking days will be covariates in the mixed effects model. Additional covariates may be selected as 
specified in the SAP. The primary endpoint will be performed on the Full Analysis Set . A sensitivity analysis will be 
performed using multiple imputation for missin g drinking data. Specification of the multiple imputation models will 
be provided in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP). D escriptive statistics will be used to present these data during the 
initial 2 -week period as well. 
Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s: Analysis of the continuous secondary endpoints (weekly mean 
drinks per week, weekly mean drinks per drinking day, percentage of days abstinent, number of cigarettes smoked 
per week, number of days of other nicotine product use per week, POMS scores, ED -RS scores, PROMIS scores , 
Urge to Drink Scores  will be analyzed in a similar fashion to that of the primary outcome  (except substituting 
baseline equivalent of the outcome as a covariate) . Analysis of the dichotomous secondary outcomes (percentage  of 
subjects with no heavy drinking days, percentage subjects abstinent from alcohol, percentage of subjects with 1- and 
2-level decreases in WHO drinking categories, and percentage of smokers abstinent from smoking) will be 
conducted via logistic regression of the endpoint measured across the entire treatment period (monthly and with 
grace periods, as specified).  Secondary analyses to satisfy statistical hypotheses will be performed on data collected 
during the 10- week mai ntenance period; however, as appropriate , descriptive statistics will be used to present these 
data during the initial 2 -week period as well. Covariate selection beyond treatment group, clinical site, and baseline 
equivalent of the endpoint will be specified in the SAP . No imputation will be used for the analysis of secondary 
endpoints.  
Exploratory Analysis : A number of variables will be tested as potential moderators of the medication treatment 
effect on the percentage of heavy drinking days  primary endpoint. Weeks 3- [ADDRESS_743473]. 
Continuous moderator variables will be dichotomized. The potential moderator variables that will be examined include measures of anxiety and depression (ECR -RS subscales of attachment and anxiety, POMS subscales of 
depression and anxiety, S pi[INVESTIGATOR_566016] I nventory , and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) , and those  suggestive 
of alcohol withdrawal (i.e., withdrawal question on the MINI for alcohol use disorder), and alcohol -related treatment 
goal.  
There is interest in exploring the use of a new Hyperkatifeia Scale as a predictor and moderator of drug response 
Exploratory analyses utilizing Hyperkatifeia Scale scores will include: 1) conducting moderator analyses using total 
Oxytocin for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 6 NIAAA Confidential   score; 2) comparison of change from baseline between treatment groups for total score and subscales.  
Ad Hoc Analyses: Ad hoc  analyses may b e performed on the Hyperkatifeia Scale as a planned part of exploring the 
utility of this scale including total scores, subscales, and individual items. Ad hoc analyses utilizing Hyperkatifeia 
Scale scores may include: 1) identification of baseline subsets  and relationship to drinking outcomes; 2) conducting 
mediator analyses; 3 ) factor analysis to better understand the underlying dimensions of hyperkatifeia; and, 4 ) 
validity of the Hyperkatifeia Scale by [CONTACT_566055] (e.g. , POMS and PROMIS  scales or subscale 
scores ). The data from this study could be used for meta -analyses with results of other studies to expand data 
availability for the proposed ad hoc analyses  
Safety Analyses:  
The severity, frequency, and relationship of AEs to investigational product will be presented by [CONTACT_144420] (MedDRA) System Organ Class ( SOC ) and Preferred Term (PT) groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. AE summary 
data will be presented by [CONTACT_2715] ( all weeks, first two weeks and last 10 weeks). Listings of each individual AE 
including start date, stop date, severity, relationship, outcome, and duration will be provided.  Clinical chemistry , 
urine drug screen results, pregnancy test results, and BAC resul ts, will be reported as summary statistics. V ital signs 
will be presented as summary statistics and change from baseline. The proportions of ECG results considered 
clinically significant will also be provided. In addition, change from baseline (shift tables) will also be presented for 
clinical chemistry  data. The numbers and proportion of subjects who reported CIWA -AR scores ≥ 10 at any time 
after the start of dosing will be presented.  Buss- Perry Aggression scores and SNAQ scores will be compared using 
repeated measures ANOVA.  The numbers and proportions of subjects mild, moderate, severe microsomia or any 
smell loss (an osmia) compared with screening assessment using the UPSIT  will also be presented.  
Compliance and Retention Analyses:  
Medication compliance, defined as the amount of investigational product taken as a proportion of the total amount 
prescribed  per protocol , will be evaluated for the oxytocin and placebo groups  based on subject’s self -report . 
Average amounts of investigational product taken overall and weekly will be reported for the oxytocin and p lacebo 
groups. In addition to self -reports, the volume self -administered will be determined by [CONTACT_566056] . The research 
participation rate, defined as percentage of subjects with complete drinking data, will be compared between 
treatment groups. In addition, the percentage of subjects discontinuing medication or early withdrawal from the study and a listing of the se reasons for discontinuation will be provided.  
Baseline Descriptive Statistics:  
Summaries of the characteristics of the subjects in each of the study groups at baseline will be  prepared . Baseline 
characteristics will be compared between the oxytocin and placebo  groups using appropriate statistical methods .

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 15 NIAAA Confidential   4. Introduction 
4.1. Alcohol Use Disorder  
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most prevalent substance use disorders (SUDs) in the 
world. An estimated 95,000 people die of alcohol- related causes in the [LOCATION_002] each year 
(Esser -2020 ). AUD is responsible for a myriad of medical, psychological, social, economic and 
personal problems ( Litten -2012). Tragically, more than 2.[ADDRESS_743489] to society is a 
staggering $229 billion each year in the [LOCATION_002] (US) ( NIAAA -2019). Mintz (2021)  
reported that overall 5.8% of persons with AUD received treatment in the past year with breakdown by [CONTACT_513523] 2.7% with mild AUD, 6.0% with moderate AUD, and 20.7% with 
severe AUD.  
Pharmacologic treatment of AUD has mostly focused on altering the reinforcing effects of 
alcohol use. Medication development has focused on several neurotransmitter systems that 
interact with the corticomesolimbic dopamine pathway, which can mediate reinforcement. Many available or prom ising compounds appear to act by [CONTACT_566057][INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
glutamate (with or without gamma aminobutyric acid, GABA), and serotonin (5- HT) ( Heilig and 
Egli-2006).  
During the past decade, advances have been made in medications development for AUD . 
Currently, there are four medications approved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) to treat alcohol dependence:  disulfiram, oral naltrexone, long- acting inje ctable (depot) 
naltrexone, and acamprosate. As these medications do not work for everyone or in all situations, additional research is vital to develop more efficacious and safe medications to treat AUD.  
4.1.1. Oxytocin  
Oxytocin is a nine amino acid peptide synthesized in the magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), and accessory magnocellular nuclei of the 
hypothalamus and is released into the bloodstream from axon terminals of these neurons that are 
located in the pos terior pi[INVESTIGATOR_168445] y.  
Oxytocin is also centrally released into the brain by [CONTACT_62535]. There is dendritic 
release from the PVN and SON in the hypothalamus, with subsequent passive diffusion to 
oxytocin receptors  that are located throughout the brain. Parvocellular neurons of the PVN also 
produce oxytocin and these neurons project centrally to diverse regions including the olfactory 
bulb, tubercule, medial and central amygdala, lateral septum, hippocampus, brainstem, and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] ( Lee and Weerts -2016).  Oxytocin is also widely distributed into peripheral tissues 
(Gimpl and Farenholz-2001).  
4.1.2. Rationale for Studying Oxytocin 
The neurochemical neurocircuits in drug rewards particularly those due to alcohol have been described ( Koob-2013). The medial forebrain bundle represents ascending and descending 
projections between the ventral forebrain (nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and septal 
area) and ventral midbrain (ventral tegmental  area ). Alcohol activates GABA  receptors or 
Oxytocin for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 16 NIAAA Confidential   enhances GABA release in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala. 
Alcohol is also hypothesized to facilitate the release of opi[INVESTIGATOR_566019], nucleus accumbens, and central nucleus of the amygdala. Alcohol facilitates the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens via an action either in the ventral tegmental area or nucleus 
accumbens. The intersection of the central release of oxytocin with many of these structures 
gives anato mic support for the idea that oxytocin might influence the neurocircuits in drug 
rewards particularly those related to alcohol abuse ( Lee and Weerts -2016). 
There have been two main threads of investigation of oxytocin on neuropsychology. One follows the initial discovery that this peptide influences forms of neuroadaptation, including learning and memory and drug addiction. The other thread is linked to the effects of oxytocin on maternal, 
social and other forms of affiliative behavior. These two pathways of investigation are 
summarized by [CONTACT_566058]ács (2014).  
Oxytocin has gained significant interest for the treatment of AUD and other drug use disorders 
(reviewed recently by [CONTACT_566059] -2016, Lee-2016 and Pederson -2017 ). This is primarily 
related to research of oxytocin’s effects in emotional regulation, pain, and stress, and its 
purported ability to modulate response to rewarding behaviors promoted by [CONTACT_8208], sex, and drugs 
(Meyer -Lindenberg-2011 ; Onaka-2012).  Lee and Weerts -2016 speculate that , “The 
comodulation of both stress and motivational processes is believed to be because of the 
important role of oxytocin to shift salience to social, affiliative processes, both by [CONTACT_566060]/or by [CONTACT_566061], allowing for attention to social 
bonding ( Baskerville and Douglas-2010). This is obviously relevant to addiction, where salience 
of drug stimuli overshadows motivation for social affiliation and where stress may trigger drug 
seeking and relapse ( Sinha-2008). ” Lee and Weerts -2016 speculation is based on their following 
observations: “Heavy alcoh ol drinking is associated with dysregulation of HPA- axis activity, as 
shown by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_566020] a blunted corticosterone (CORT) response to stress during early abstinence ( Kemper -1990; Wand and Dobs-1991; Errico -
1993; Vescovi -1997; Boschloo-2011). A blunted CORT response has been associated with 
increased anxiety and craving during acute abstinence and subsequent relapse to heavy drinking 
(Higley -2011; Sinha-2011; Walter - 2006).”  
4.1.3. Pharmacokinetics  in the Natural State  (non -drug treated)  
Most of the oxytocin in the body is stored in the posterior pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]. In humans, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_566021] 14 U (28 µg). This gland lies outside the blood-brain 
barri er, so peptide released from this gland  readily enters the blood. There is no barrier to the 
passage of peptides between the blood and interstitial fluid of the body, so the distribution 
volume for oxytocin is much larger than the plasma volume. 
Circulatin g concentrations (except in pregnancy) are 1–10 pg/mL, and the pharmacokinetics 
(PK) after intravenous injection fit a two -compartment model, with a distribution volume of 
33 L, a distribution half- life of 3 .2 minutes, and an elimination half -life of 20 minutes. Oxytocin 
is stable in plasma (except in pregnancy, when oxytocinase is abundant) and is cleared from the 
blood via the kidneys and liver. Oxytocin is thought to be cleared from cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) by a combination of flow into the subarachnoid space and active transport into blood.

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 17 NIAAA Confidential   4.1.4. Pharmac okinetics after Intranasal Administration  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Non-clinical 
When 12 µg (mice) or 20 µg (rat) were  administered to rodents, analysis of microdialysates 
showed that oxytocin levels in the amygdala and hippocampus increased by [CONTACT_3450] 
100%, demonstrating evidence that nasally applied oxytocin indeed reaches behaviorally relevant  brain  areas, and this uptake is paralleled by [CONTACT_566062] 
(Neumann -2013 ). Studies performed in rhesus macaques have also demonstrated that  
intranasally  administered oxytocin resulted in increased concentrations in both CSF and plasma 
as compared with  saline  (Dal Monte-2014 ). When nasal spray delivered oxytocin was compared 
with nebulizer delivery, similar elevations of CSF oxytocin concentration were observed; 
however, elevations of plasma oxytocin were greater with the nasal spray administration .  
Lee (201 8) showed that plasma and CSF concentrations were increased after intravenous and 
intranasal  administration in Rhesus macaques and that this increase was due to the administered 
oxytocin and not to increases in endogenous levels. That oxytocin was detected in the CSF, 
supports that intranasal oxytocin penetrates through the blood- brain barrier.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical  
Measurement  of oxytocin plasma levels following intranasal  administration of [ADDRESS_743490] administration, whereas CSF level s did not peak until 75 
min after administration ( Striepens -2013).  
In a recent review, Leng  and Sabatier (2016)  have suggested that two routes may exist for the 
passage of oxytocin from nose to brain. The first route is internalization of peptide into olfactory 
or trigeminal neurons, followed by [CONTACT_566063]. The second is passage 
through intercellular clefts into the subarachnoid space. If vast amounts of peptide accumulate in 
the subarachnoid space, the concentration difference across the blood-brain barrier might support 
nonspecific passage. It is further suggested that peptides may cross the blood–brain barrier in 
small amounts either by [CONTACT_566064]. 
4.1.5. Nonclinical Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Mouse Models  
King (2017) reported t hat oxytocin in a dose dependent manner reduces ethanol self -
administration in C57 BL/6 mouse model of binge-like drinking.  In this report, male C57BL/6J 
mice were assessed for reduction in binge-like drinking after administration of oxytocin (0, 0.3, 
1, 3, or 10 mg/kg) given access to ethanol (20% v/v) using a model of binge-like drinking 
(“drinking in the dark”) that included the use of lickometer circuits to evaluate the temporal 
pattern of intake as well as [ADDRESS_743491] and that 
oxytocin receptors had a role in mediating the effects. In a subsequent C57BL/6 mouse study, 
King (2019)  evaluated alcohol relapse -like behavior using lever responses in operant 
conditioning chambers for alcohol in daily self-administration sessions. Once lever responding 
and alcohol intake stabilized mice were tested under extinction conditions for 14 days before 
Oxytocin for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 18 NIAAA Confidential   reinstatement testing. O xytocin at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1 mg/kg, attenuated alcohol-seeking 
behavior in a dose- related manner in male and female mice in response to acute challenge with a 
predator odor. Additionally, oxytocin administration of 1 mg/kg produced a similar decrease in 
alcohol relapse-like behavior triggered by [CONTACT_566065]. 
Mice develop tolerance to th e hypothermic effect of ethanol by [CONTACT_566066] n ot become as hypothermic as on Day 1. One  injection of oxytocin 
(1 U per animal ) prior to the first injection of ethanol did not change temperature sensitivity in 
response to alco hol, but daily treatment with oxytocin did block the development of tole rance 
(Szabo -1987). In addition, Szabo ( 1987) showed that pi[INVESTIGATOR_566022]-induced seizures in alcohol 
dependent mice were ameliorated by [CONTACT_300854]. Mice were made physically dependent on 
ethanol, and the severity of withdrawal symptoms was assess ed by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_566023]. 
Oxytocin-treated mice displayed milder withdrawal symptoms in response to increasing doses 
(0.2-2.0 U). Earlier studies confirmed that oxytocin attenuated tolerance to ethanol -induced 
hypothermia, and also attenuated tolerance to ethanol-induced myorelaxation and akinesia (Jodogne-1991).  
In another study ( Bahi -2015), ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (EtOH- CPP) in mice 
was established by [CONTACT_566067]. The effects of oxytocin receptor pharmacological modulation, using the oxytocin analog Carbetocin, and genetic overexpression in the nucleus accumbens, using lentiviral- mediated gene transfer 
technology, was investigated. In the first experiment, results showed that Carbetocin administration and nucleus accumbens oxytocin receptor-overexpression reduced EtOH- CPP 
establishment. In the second experiment, systemic Carbetocin treatment and oxytocin receptor 
overexpression resulted in decreased time spent in the ethanol paired compartment following 
completion of a 7-day extinction protocol. Finally, the third experiment showed that Carbetocin and oxytocin receptor-overexpression suppressed primed reinstatement of EtOH-CPP. The 
authors concluded that pharmacological and genetic modulation of the oxytocin receptor can 
modulate the acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of conditioned reinforcing effects of ethanol ( Bahi-2015). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rat Models  
Studies were conducted in animals to better understand how oxytocin affected consumption of a sweet alcohol -containing beverage that is popular with young Australian humans (Raspberry 
Vodka Cruiser, 5% ethanol v/v; McGregor and Bowen-2012). Alcohol- preferring rats were given 
a choice between this beverage and a non -alcoholic sweet solution (3% sucrose) in daily sessions 
in a “lickometer” apparatus. A single administration of oxytocin (1 mg/kg) resulted in a long lasting decline (at least 6 weeks) in the preference for the alcoholic beverage relative to sucrose. 
When rats were given a choice bet ween 0.05% saccharine and 10% ethanol in 0.05% saccharine, 
there was  a decrease in total ethanol intake of about 40% on days when oxytocin (0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 
and 0.5 mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally ( MacFadyen-2016 ). 
Tunstall (2017)  used an established rat model of alcohol dependence to investigate oxytocin’s 
effect s on dependence-induced alcohol drinking, enhanced motivation for alcohol, and altered 
GABAergic transmission in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). In this model, when oxytocin was administered intraperitoneally, intranasally, or into the brain, it blocked enhanced 
alcohol drinking at doses that did not alter non–alcohol- related  behaviors or alcohol drinking in 
Oxytocin for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) [ADDRESS_743492] was specific to  alcohol drinking in alcohol 
dependence.  They also examined  ex vivo  electrophysiological recordings from CeA neurons that 
indicated that oxytocin decreases evoked GABA transmission in nondependent but not in 
dependent rats, but oxytocin decreased the amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic responses in 
both groups. They concluded that “Oxytocin blocked the facilitatory  effects of acute alcohol on 
GABA release in the CeA of dependent but not nondependent rats. Together, these results 
provide converging evidence that oxytocin specifically and selectively blocks the enhanced 
motiv ation for alcohol drinking that develops in alcohol dependence likely via a central 
mechanism that may result from altered oxytocin effects on CeA GABA transmission in alcohol 
dependence.”  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prairie Vole Models  
Prairie voles are an  interesting species to study the effects of medications to treat AUD, as this 
species  both consumes high amounts of alcohol and forms oxytocin dependent social bonds in a 
manner similar to humans.  Oxytocin treatment (1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced alcohol 
consumption in ma le and female prairie voles in animals that had access to 15% ethanol vs water 
every other day for 12 alcohol drinking sessions ( Stevenson-2017). In an open field locomotor 
test, oxytocin (1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) did not affect overall locomotor activity. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Conclusions from Animal Models 
Overall, in animal models there is evidence that oxytocin, administered systemically or centrally, 
reduces self -administra tion of alcohol and reinstatement of responding induced by [CONTACT_566068]. The mechanisms seem to involve the midbrain dopaminergic as well as 
medial prefrontal glutamatergic pathways ( Lee and Weerts -2016, Pederson -2017, Tunstall-
2017).   
4.1.6. Clinical Efficacy  in Alcohol Use Disorder  
Ryabinin and Fulenwider (2021)  have recently reviewed  the extensive literature on rodent and 
human studies evaluating the effects  of oxytocin on alcohol’s effects and alcohol- related 
behaviors. They present studies reporting both positive and no effects. They concluded that most 
studies support that oxytocin reduces alcohol consumption in both males and females, but that 
more studies are needed to examine oxytocin’s effects on alcohol- related tolerance, withdrawal, 
craving, anxiety and social affiliations in subjects of both sexes. 
The following summarizes studies relevant to the design of this trial with respect to dose 
selection and regimen, safety and efficacy on intranasal oxytocin. 
Pederson’s group completed 3 small randomized -controlled trials of intranasal oxytocin in 
patients with AUD ( Pederson-2013, Pederson -2017) suggesting that intranasal oxytocin may 
attenuate alcohol withdrawal symptoms, reduce very heavy drinking, reduce anxiety scores, and 
can be safety administered at doses of 80 IU/day for 12 weeks. 
Pederson (2013)  reported the results of a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_566024]. This study was a randomized, placebo -controlled, double-blind pi[INVESTIGATOR_366371] 3 days of BID intranasal  oxytocin (24  IU /dose) versus placebo in 11 alcohol-dependent 
inpatient subjects undergoing inpatient detoxi fication with  symptom- triggered  lorazepam  for 
withdrawal symptoms . Outcome measures included the amount of lorazepam received, Alcohol 
Oxytocin for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) [ADDRESS_743493] (AWSC), Clinical 
Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol scale (CIWA), Penn Alcohol Craving Scale 
(PAC S), and Profile of Mood States (POMS).  For the 7 oxytocin treated  patients v ersus the 4 
placebo patients, lorazepam use was less  (3.4 mg  ± 4.7 mg  (SD) vs  16.5mg ±4.4; P=0.0015), 
CIWA scores were less on D ays 1 and 2, AWCS scores were less on Day 1 , and POMS 
tension/anxiety subscale was significantly lower in the oxytocin group (P=0.007). The authors concluded that the result s are the first evidence that oxytocin may block alcohol withdrawal 
symptoms in humans. In another study of the effects of intranasal oxytocin on the need for oxazepam for alcohol detoxification, a 3-day course of a lower dose 24 IU BID, did not show statistically significant differences in oxazepam use, although there was a trend for a lower 
amount ( Melby -2019). There were no SAEs or oxytocin- related AEs in participants with alcohol 
dependence.  
The Pederson (2013)  study was replicated in a substantially different cohort of patients with low 
socioeconomic status heavy drinking ( Pederson -2017) . Intranasal  test treatments ( 24 IU oxytocin 
or placebo  three times daily  – total daily dose 72 IU ) were initiated within the first 36h of their 
inpatient stay in  individuals who had not received more than a total of 6mg of lorazepam to 
control withdrawal symptoms since admission. CIWA ratings were obtained every 4h in patients 
admitted for alcohol detoxification. During the 48h after initiation of randomly assigned intranasal test treatments, mean CIWA  scores declined in oxytocin recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (N=4) but 
increased in placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  (N=4) (P= 0.025). The sum of lorazepam doses (each 2 mg) given 
for elevated CIWA scores during the 48-h period trended toward being lower in oxytocin recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (P=0.076). 
In a 12- week randomized -controlled trial comparing twice daily intranasal oxytocin t o intranasal 
placebo ( 40 IU of oxytocin/dose or placebo three times daily for the first 2 days and then twice 
daily for the remainder of the 12- week treatment period ), Pederson (2017)  evaluated  treatment 
effects in patients with AUD who were very heavy drinkers ( ≥[ADDRESS_743494] drinks/week for men, 
≥[ADDRESS_743495] drinks/week for women). Twelve patients received intranasal oxytocin and 10 
patients received placebo of whi ch 13 were males and 9 were females. Statistical analyses 
revealed that the oxytocin compared to the placebo treatment group had significantly fewer 
heavy drinking days (P=0.047; about 15 fewer heavy drinking days during the 12- week trial,  
d=0.97) and drank very significantly fewer drinks/drinking day (P=0.0008; about 2.6 fewer 
drinks/drinking day during the trial, d=1.83). No significant oxytocin effect on abstinent days 
was noted. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_566025] -ratings trended weakly toward being lower in the 
oxytocin compared to the placebo group (P=0.098), corresponding to an on- average 3.5 -point 
difference. There were no group differences in alcohol craving scores. No severe adverse events occurred. Also, vital signs remained stable and laboratory measu res remained within normal 
limits in all subjects  except for transient, asymptomatic, and mild hyponatremia in three oxytocin 
subjects.  
In a human laboratory double-blind, crossover study of 32 non-treatment seeking alcohol 
abusing (defined as per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition 
criteria) , the effects of  single dose intranasal oxytocin (40 IU) were evaluated on measures s ocial 
perceptual ability, cue- induced craving, and approach bias for alcohol and appetitive imagery 
(Mitchell-2016). Oxytocin significantly improved recognition of easier items on a social 
perception tas k. Although there was no main effect of oxytocin on cue-induced craving for 
alcohol, a subsequent analysis revealed that oxytocin’s  effect on craving w as moderated by

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 21 NIAAA Confidential   attachment anxiety, such that oxytocin reduc ed craving in more anxiously attached individuals 
and increased  craving in less anxiously attached individuals. Subjects did not display an 
approach bias to alcohol images on the placebo day, preventing meaningful analysis of the 
effects of oxytocin on this measure. However, s ubjects did display an approach bias to appetitive 
images on the placebo day, which was significantly reduced by [CONTACT_566070]. No adverse reactions were reported . 
4.1.7. Clinical Efficacy and /or Safety of Intranasal Oxytocin in Other Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Disorders  
In a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 16 cannabis-dependent subjects, pretreatment with 
oxytocin (40 IU) reduced marijuana craving and stress scores after a human laboratory session 
but did not alter anxiety scores ( McRae- Clark -2013).  
In a double-blind, placebo -controlled study of 31- cocaine dependent subjects , Flanagan (2015)  
examined the effect of oxytocin on neuroendocrine reactivity to a laboratory social stress paradigm. Participants were randomized to receive a single dose of oxytocin (40 IU) or placebo before the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Administra tion of intranasal oxytocin induced a 
significant decrease in both cortisol and DHEA levels (Cortisol: Δ=  -0.29±0.13, p=0.035 and 
DHEA: Δ=−0.40±0.13, p=0.004) prior to administration of the TSST. These changes were not significant for subjects who received  placebo (Cortisol: Δ = - 0.12±0.13, p=0.348 and DHEA: Δ=  
-0.11±0.12, p=0.368). There was no effect of the administration of intranasal oxytocin on cortisol or DHEA response levels immediately following the TSST (Cortisol: Δ=0.20±0.15, p=0.166 and DHEA: Δ=0 .10±0.13, p=0.419). 
Feifel (2010) conducted a randomized , double blind cross over study in [ADDRESS_743496] one antipsychotic drug. Intranasal oxytocin was dosed at 20 IU (5 sprays) twice a day for the first week and 40 U (10 
sprays) twice a day for the following 2 weeks. Analysis of the 15 subjects who completed all the 
study visits revealed that oxytocin significantly reduced scores on the Positive and N egative 
Symptom Scale  and Clinical Globa l Impression -Improvement Scale (p < .001) compared with 
placebo at the [ADDRESS_743497] of 18 IU of oxytocin intranasally daily for 6 weeks on obsessive compulsive behaviors 
(Den Boer -1992). No reductions in the number of compulsive behaviors were observed in either 
treatment group. Two additional patients were treated with 54 IU of oxytocin intranasally of 
which only one patient had a slight reduction in obsessive-compulsive behavior. Side effects 
were mild and transient. In the placebo group, 1 patient complained of headache. In the oxytocin group, 4 patients had mild dizziness and 2 patie nts reported dry mouth and mild headache.  
Epperson (1996) also conducted a placebo -controlled of intranasal oxytocin in 7 patients with 
obsessive compulsive disorder administered higher doses of oxytocin (320 IU oxytocin intranasally per day for 7 days). No cardiac or serum osmolarity AEs were reported; and as reported by [CONTACT_566071] (1992) , there was no clinical benefit.  
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study, 59 women with chronic constipation were administered placebo (30 subjects) or intranasal oxytocin (29 subjects) twice daily ( five

2005). There was no significant advantage on constipation. In addition, no effects on blood 
pressure or electrolyte concentrations were seen in either the treated or placebo group. Eleven subjects in the oxytocin group (48%) and 12 subjects in the control group (47%) reported side 
effects including headache (11), nausea (6), abdominal pain (6), weight gain (4) and local 
irritation in the nasal mucosa (8). The distribution of side effects was equal in the two groups.  
4.1.8. Safety of Single Dose and Multiple Dose Intranasal Oxytocin 
Macdonald (2011 ) published a systematic review of 38 randomized  controlled trials conducted 
between 1990 and 2010 that investigated the central effects of intranasal  oxytocin. In the 
1529 subjects  included in this review, 79% of subjects were male and  8% were participants with 
developmental or mental health difficulties. Single dosages ranged from [ADDRESS_743498] 
were single doses except for the reports of Epperson-1996 (320 U oxytocin intranasally per day 
for 7 days) and Ohlsson-2005 (80 U per day in divided doses of 40 U twice daily for 13 weeks) . 
The data from this review are summarized in Table 1 . Side effects were not different between 
oxytocin and placebo. P articipants were unable to accurately report on whether they had received 
oxytocin or placebo.

Three SAEs related to hyponatremia were cited  among 3 patients receiving oxytocin. One was in 
an obsessive- compulsive patient who was treated with ~12  U oxytocin intranasally  daily for 4 
weeks  and who had a marked decrease in plasma sodium (126 mmol/L) and osmolarity (252 
mosm/kg  which was  down from 290 mosm/kg prior to therapy),  in addition to an SAE involving 
psychotic symptoms ( Ansseau -1987). Two reports involved long- term use of intran asal oxytocin 
plus excessive water intake to facilitate lactation  (Ansseau -1987). Hyponatremia in response to 
oxytocin may be due to the chemical similarity between oxytocin and the other pi[INVESTIGATOR_460788], argentine vasopressin (anti-diuretic hormone).

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 23 NIAAA Confidential   4.1.9. Safety of Multiple -Dose Intranasal Oxytocin 
Studies of 1 -4 Weeks Duration : Four studies provided safety information for oxytocin twice 
daily ( BID) dose regimens of 1- 4 we eks duration, with dose regimens ranging from 20 IU 
(Feifel -2010) to 72 IU ( Finger-2015). In the 3 studies which listed specific AEs ( Feifel -2010, 
Finger-2015, Parker -2017), those AEs that were reported in more than 1 patient included: 
inappropriate sexual behavior/ hypersexuality;  sleep impairment; headache; dyspepsia /nausea; 
dizziness/lightheadedness; nasal irr itation; and nasal congestion. There appeared to be no dose 
relationship  with respect to any of these AEs. Nasal AEs (nasal irritation or nasal congestion) 
were the only AEs that were reported in more than 1 study ( Feifel -2010, Parker -2017), and nasal 
discomfort from the intranasal spray was also a reason for [ADDRESS_743499] withdrawal ( Feifel -2010). In 
one study in patients with dementia ( Finger-2015 ), inappropri ate sexual behavio ur/ 
hypersexuality was reported  in 5 (31%) of the 15 patients receiving oxytocin, compared with 1 
(14%) of the 7 placebo patients (p = 0.4). However, there was no clear dose-response 
relationship, as this behaviour was seen only at the 2 lower doses of oxytocin (24 or 48 IU BID) 
and not at the highest dose (72 IU BID). Information on vital signs effects was available from [ADDRESS_743500] on vital signs ( Finger-2015, 
Pedersen -2011 ), and the third study ( Parker -2017 ) suggesting that systolic standing blood 
pressure increased in subjects treated with oxytocin 24 IU BID for 4 weeks. Oxytocin 24 IU - 40 IU BID for 2 weeks was not associated with changes in blood chemistry or urine parameters in two studies ( Pedersen -2011, Feifel -2010).  
Studies of 5 -8 Weeks Duration : Eight studies provided safety information for oxytocin BID or 
three- times -per-day ( QID) dose regimens of 5-8 weeks duration. Dosing regimens varied widely 
in these studies, with 3 of the studies investigating an oxytocin regimen of 24 IU BID 
(Anagnostou-2012, Watanabe-2015, Cacciotti-Saija-2014) and 2 studies employing doses up to 
40 IU BID ( Einfeld -2014 , Modabbernia-2013). The highest daily dose of oxytocin (24 IU QID) 
and the highest cumulative exposure (96 IU/day x 56 days for a total of 5376 IU) was an 8- week 
study of oxytocin use against binge eating disorder ( Agabio-2016). Only one of the 8 studies 
reported SAEs associated with oxytocin treatment. That was the study by [CONTACT_566072] (2016) , 
where 2 (13.3%) of [ADDRESS_743501] in 3 different studies  (Yatawara-2016, Cacciotti-Saija-2014, Modabbernia-2013).   
Studies of 12 -13 Weeks Duration : Three studies provided safety inf ormation for oxytocin BID 
dose regimens of 12-13 weeks duration. In 2 of the 3 studies, oxytocin was administered at a dose of 40 IU BID ( Pederson -2017, Ohlsson-2005), while in the third study, oxytocin daily 
dosing was titrated to as high as 72 IU BID ( Feifel-2013). No SAEs were reported in any of 
these studies . Furthermore, the study by [CONTACT_566073] (2017) reported no AEs of any type in the 
oxytocin treatment group. In the 2 studies that did report AEs ( Feifel -2013
 , Ohlsson-2005), the [ADDRESS_743502] in both studies were headache, nausea, and weight gain. 
Two studies ( Feifel -2013 , Ohlsson-2005) found that oxytocin had no adverse effects on blood 
chem istry/electrolytes, while a third study found that oxytocin did not a ffect urine ( Feifel -2013). 
Only one study ( Ohlsson-2005) addressed changes in vital signs, concluding that oxytocin did 
not affect blood pressure.

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) [ADDRESS_743503] Frequently Reported AEs : For all of the multiple -dose studies described above, AEs  that 
were reported  in more than [ADDRESS_743504] in more than 1 study of 1 -13 weeks duration included: 
nausea (5 studies), headache (5 studies), dizziness (3 studies), constipation (3 studies), nasal 
irritation (3 studies), thirst (2 studies), increased urination (2 studies), palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] (2 studies), increased appetite (2 studies), weight gain (2 studies), dry mouth/throat (2 studies), and somnolence/drowsiness (2 studies).  Table 2 presents the se AEs  grouped by [CONTACT_566074]. In the majority of cases, there was no clear evidence of dose-dependent relationship. The one possible exception was the AE of “palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]”, which was reported in 11.1% of subjects at a cumulative oxytocin dose of 2016 IU in one study and in 25% of subjects at a higher 5376 IU cumulative dose in a second study.  However, because data for this AE is availab le from only 2 studies, the ability to identify a true trend is very limited.

Given that the cumulative dose of oxytocin administered in the current protocol is 5320 IU over 12 weeks, AEs reported at cumulative doses of 4200 IU – 7280 IU in Table  2 are especially 
relev ant. These include nausea, headache, dizziness, constipation, nasal irritation, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
increased appetite, weight gain, dry mouth/throat, and somnolence/drowsiness. Based on the AEs percentages shown in Table  2 at increasing cumulative doses of oxytocin, t here was no 
suggestion of a dose-response for any of these AEs. In addition, 4 of the AEs (drowsiness, dry 
throat/mouth, nasal irritation, and headache) were also seen in the systematic review of single-dose studies ( Table 1 ) but occurred at comparable or lower frequencies than in Placebo subjects.  
In conclusion, oxytocin appears safe at a variety of doses and in a range of clinical populations as 
reported in the literature. However, because oxytocin can modify hea rt rate and the anti -diuretic

4.1.10. Rationale for Selection of Doses for this Study 
As presented above, i ntranasal oxytocin has been studied in small clinical trials of patients with 
mental health disorders at doses ranging from 18 IU to 320 IU given as single doses or in divided 
doses given BID or QID for as long as 13 weeks. The 3 small randomized controlled trials 
examining the effects of intranasal oxytocin in patients with AU D reported by [CONTACT_566073] 
(Pederson -2013, Pederson -2017) suggest ed that intranasal oxytocin may attenuate alcohol 
withdrawal symptoms, reduce very heavy drinking, reduce anxiety scores, and can be safe ly 
administered at doses of 80 IU/day for 12 weeks. This Phase 2 trial proposes to study a dose of 
70 IU/day in a larger group of patients, with a run-in period of 2-weeks of once- daily intranasal 
oxytocin at 35 IU, followed by 10-weeks of twice daily oxytocin at 35 IU for a total daily dose of 70 IU that is similar to the dose shown to be safe and effective in reducing drinking, craving, anxiety, and withdrawal by [CONTACT_566073] (2017) . 
4.2. Study Design  
This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi- site clinical 
trial designed to assess the efficacy of oxytocin compared with placebo to reduce drinking in 100 subjects ( 50 in each group) who report 4 or more Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders – Fifth Edition (DSM-5
™) symptoms of AUD. This study will be conducted at 4 
clinical sites. If eligible for the study, subjects will be  randomized using a stratified permuted 
block randomization procedure with “clinical site” as a stratification variable in an approximate 
1:1 ratio (targeting 50 subjects per group) to receive either intranasal oxytocin or placebo for 12 
weeks.  
If eligible  for the study, subjects will receive blinded intranasal oxytocin at 35 IU once- per-day 
or intra nasal placebo (same volume once- per-day) for 2 weeks (initial tolerability assessment 
period), then for the next 10 weeks (maintenance period) subjects will receive oxytocin at 35 IU/ 
BID,  (total daily dose 70 IU) or intranasal placebo (same volume BID ). 
Subjects will be seen in the clinic at screening visit(s), at randomization  (Week 1), and at Weeks 
2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 13. During the alternate weeks when the subjects will not be coming into the clinic they will be contact[CONTACT_566075], adverse events (AEs), and concomitant medications. A 
final follow -up telephone interview will occur during Week 14/15 (1 -to-2 weeks after the end of 
dosing). 
The overall study schema is provided in Figure 1.  The study schedule of visits and assessments is 
shown in Table [ADDRESS_743506] possibly related  SAEs  as judged by [CONTACT_566076]. If this occurs, a DSMB will be convened and a decision in 
conjunction with the study Sponsor will be made regarding stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098].

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 30 NIAAA Confidential   4.3. Benefit/ Risk Assessment  
Intranasal oxytocin is remarkably well tolerated  and 80 IU per day has been administered for up 
to 13 weeks in two studies ( Ohlsson-2005, Pederson -2017). Infrequent hyponatremia, probably 
secondary to an anti- diuretic effect, and infrequent nasal irritation have resulted in cessation of 
treatment . To minimize this risk, patients with significant gastrointestinal, cardiac, neurological, 
and renal disorders as well as pregnant or lactating women will be excluded . Sodium levels in 
addition to other liver enzyme and creatinine levels will be monitored over the course of 
treatment. A physical examination of the nares and throat will also be performed for signs of 
irritation ; and sense of smell will be regularly evaluated . Dose reductions are permitted in the 
event of intolerance. The benefit of participating  in this study is that all subjects will be asked to 
view the “Take Control” behavioral platform. The intervention is derived from a self-help approach developed by [CONTACT_566077]-based, field tested information for 
individuals with alcohol problems, and suggestions for making changes in their drinking. In 
addition, it is possible that subject randomized to receive Oxytocin nasal spray may reduce their alcohol drinking which can have positive overall health benefits.

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 31 NIAAA Confidential   5. Study Objectives  
5.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of oxytocin in reducing the weekly 
percentage of heavy drinking days over 10 weeks of maintenance treatment among subjects with 
moderate to severe AUD. A “heavy drinking day” is 4 or more drinks per drinking day for 
women and 5 or more drinks per drinking day for men. 
5.2. Secondary Objective  
Secondary objectives include assessment of other measures of the effects of oxytocin compared 
with placebo on reduction of alcohol use as well as effects on alcohol craving, alcohol- related 
consequences, cigarette smoking and other nicotine use, psychological assessments, retention in the study, and safety and tolerability throughout the study.

6.1. Investigational Products: Oxytocin and Placebo  
Investigational products will be manufactured under contract with University of Iowa and will be 
packaged and distributed in drug kits by [CONTACT_449616], Inc. Oxytocin and Placebo liquid formulations 
will be packaged in 20 mL  vials with a fill volume of 18 mL with a Nemera P270 pump spray 
actuator device crimped to the vial. Oxytocin is supplied at a concentration of 70 IU/mL . The  
pump spray actuator deliver s 100 μL in a single spray (equivalent to 7 IU of oxytocin).  
Oxytocin and placebo  will be administered once daily (morning) for 2 weeks (Weeks 1 and 2) 
and then twice daily (morning and evening) for 10 weeks (Weeks 3 through 12). One dose is 
defined as the intranasal  administration of [ADDRESS_743509] Packaging, Labeling, and Distribution of Drug Kits 
Investigational products will be provided in drug kits containing 6 bottles of either oxytocin or 
placebo in each kit with e ach bottle contain ing 18 mL of oxytocin or placebo. Kits will be 
shipped periodically to sites during the study depending on enrollment. 
The study number and the words “oxytocin or placebo study” will be preprinted on each vial  
label. The label will also h ave a unique kit number, the volume contained in the bottle, storage 
conditions, and the words “Caution: New Drug – Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (or [LOCATION_002]) L aw to

The site principal investigator ( PI) or designated study personnel will maintain a log of the 
receipt of all investigational products and record of dispensing of all investigational products to 
the subject. Investigational product for each subject will be inventoried and accounted for 
throughout the trial. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her staff will count the drug kits/individual vials remaining at the end of the study and record the vial  count on the appropriate drug accountability form. 
Subjects will be asked to return any used and/or unused vials  of investigation product at each 
clinic visit for accountability.  Subjects will be provided with a Diary Card ( Appendix A ) to 
complete each time they self -administer a dose and will be asked to bring the card back at each 
clinic visit for site staff to review and confirm dosing compliance.  
6.6. Used/Unused Investigational Product Supplies  
Unuse d investigational products will be retained at the clinic al sites until the end of the study, at 
which time they will be shipped back to Catalent  for destruction.  
6.7. Investigational Product Administration 
To control dosing and absorption of investigational product, subjects will be instructed to administer the nasal spray with their head in an upright position closing one nostril with one finger while administering the spray in the other nostril and sniffing during administration. At 
the firs t administration  on Study Day 1, subjects will be provided with instruction on how to self-

an instruction sheet to take home. At subsequent visits, subjects will be asked to return the nasal 
spray devices.  
Missed Doses:  Subjects will be instructed if the dose is not taken at the recommended time, to 
skip this dose, and the next dose should be taken at the time of next scheduled dose ; doses should 
never be doubled up.  Dose Reductions and Discontinuation. I f the subject is not tolerating the investigational 
product, the dose can be reduced by 14 I U or 200 μL increments per  dose (2 less sprays)  to 
determine if the subject can tolerate a lower dose. For example, one spray in each  nostril can be 
omitted for each reduction . Then the subject should try to continue to give one dose in the 
morning and one dose in the evening if during the maintenance period . If the dose is reduced 
during the initial [ADDRESS_743516], he /she can simply discontinue immediately . In the 
event that a female subject becomes pregnant, she will be instructed to discontinue taking the 
investigational product immediately .  
6.8. Take Control Behavioral Platform 
The behavioral platform “Take Control” consists of a series of 7 computerized modules. Subjects will view each module of “Take Control” at clinic visit starting at Week [ADDRESS_743517] remain at the clinic al site . The intervention is derived from a self- help approach 
developed by [CONTACT_566077]-based, field tested information for individuals with 
alcohol problems, and suggestions for making changes in their drinking. The NIAAA materia l is 
publicly available in a NIAAA booklet entitled “Rethinking Drinking” and on a NIAAA website 
http://rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov. Delivering these materials in a computerized method in 
this trial has the advantage of standardizing the amount of educational mat erial received by [CONTACT_1560].   
6.9.  Concomitant Medications 
For study inclusion, subjects cannot be taking oxytocin for any reason and must agree to not take non-study oxytocin during the study. In addition, subjects cannot have taken any anti-
convulsants, hypnotics, barbiturates, antipsychotics, psychomotor stimulants (such as methylphenidate), or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_373377] 5-half- lives  prior to the date of randomization. In 
addition, i f a subject is taking a medication for depression or anxiety, he or she must have been 
taking a stable dose in the 2-months prior to randomization and plan to continue during the study. This includes drugs such as the following: 
• selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  
• dual uptake inhibitors  
• serotonin-norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] (SNRIs)  
• tricyclic antidepressants  
Oxytocin for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 35 NIAAA Confidential   • monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) 
• bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_566027]-label or experimentally for treatment of alc oholism are prohibited during the study. The 
following drugs are thus prohibited: 
• Oral naltrexone (Revia, Depade)  
• Depot naltrexone (Vivitrol) 
• Disulfiram (Antabuse)  
• Acamprosate (Campral)  
• Nalmefene (Selincro)  
• Baclofen  
• Varenicline  
Also, if a subject reports using a drug or having been prescribed a drug to treat alcoholism during the trial, they will be asked to discontinue its use.  
The use of nicotine nasal sprays will be prohibited during the study. The use of other intranasal 
vasoconstricting products is allowed; however, subjects will be instructed to not use these within 2 hours before or 1 hour after intranasal investigational products are self- administered.  Examples 
are decongestant nasal sprays contain ing oxymetazoline, epi[INVESTIGATOR_566028]. 
Subjects will be instructed to check with study staff before taking any new medications or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_566029]. Subjects will be informed that starting any new medication without consulting study staff could pose health risks and/or result in their discontinuation for the study drug. 
Management of investigational products and concomitant medications during the study is at the 
discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_566030]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_566031]. 
When oxytocin has been given intravenously to induce labor, severe hypertension has been 
reported when oxytocin was given three to four hours following prophylactic administration of a 
vasoconstrictor in conjunction with caudal block anesthesia. Cyclopropane anesthesia may 
modify oxytocin's cardiovascular effects, so as to produce unexpected results such as hypotension. Maternal sinus bradycardia with abnormal atrioventricular rhythms has also been 
noted when oxytocin was used concomitantly with cyclopropane anesthesia.  Therefore, subjects 
should be cautioned if undergoing elective surgery or emergency surgery to discuss the use of 
anesthetics with the prescribing physician and possible drug-drug interactions with oxytocin.

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) [ADDRESS_743518] recruitment methods at each site will be based on their local population; however, 
standard tactics will be used (i.e., flyers, newspaper advertisements, radio advertisements, and 
television advertisements). Advarra Investigational Review Board (IR B) and NIAAA will 
approve all advertising materials used for subject recruitment. Interested candidates responding 
to recruitment materials by [CONTACT_566079] a standardized telephone 
interview that includes questions about their drinking behavior, health status, interest in participation, and availability for the entire [ADDRESS_743519] screening visit, candidates will meet with either the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee and receive an explanation of the study purpose and requirements. If still interested after receiving an 
explanation of the study, the candidate will be given an opportunity to review, inquire about, and 
sign the study informed consent form approved by [CONTACT_1201]. Subjects must have blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.000 measured by [CONTACT_30300] 
(tested shortly before or just after providing consent). Repeat measurements of BAC are 
permitted at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects will be given a copy of the signed informed consent form. All subjects who sign informed consent must be registered in the 
electronic data management system (EDMS) as enrolled in the study. The EDMS will assign the 
subject a unique subject ID number that will be used on all of the data collection forms and electronic system entries.  
7.3. Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects

NOTE: Current psychotherapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Psychotherapy 
for a disorder that may be related to the subject’s use of alcohol should be exclusionary. 
However, shorter term focused behavioral therapy for defined, non-alcohol related problems 
may be acceptable.  
8. Have undergone medical detoxification (e.g., reports using a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) during the 
screening phase (prior to randomization). 
9. Have known allergy to oxytocin.

C-SSRS with concurrence aft er a study physician’s evaluation if the response to 
C-SSRS questions 1 or 2 is “yes”). 
Note: The MINI suicidality module rates scores of 1 to 8 as a diagnosis of low risk of 
suicidality. As the MINI questions that could result in a low risk score are cons idered 
inadequate to fully determine the potential suicidal risk of an individual (e.g., “Feel 
hopeless” and “Think that you would be better off dead or wish you were dead?” 
responses of “yes” dictates a score of 1 for each question), any subject who scores in the 
low risk category should be evaluated further by a study physician or psychologist who should document whether the subject is appropriate for study inclusion based on his/her 
clinical judgment of the potential suicide risk of the subject. Likewise , if the subject 
responds “yes” to either of the first two questions on the screening C-SSRS performed on 
the day of randomization as a final eligibility check, the subject should also evaluated by 
a study physician for current suicidality risk, who should document the subject’s 
suitability for study inclusion. 
15. Have moderate or serious dementia as assessed by [CONTACT_461].  
16. Be pregnant or breast -feeding or have plans to become pregnant at any time during the 
study.

will undergo the following assessments: 
• Demographics and locator form 
• Urine drug screen 
• Medical history  
• Physical examination  and body weight 
• MINI   
• Clinical chemistry  
• Pregnancy test  for females of childbearing potential and birth control methods, if 
female  
• Vital signs

Subjects will be instructed that if they are taking a medication for depression or anxiety that they should continue to do so throughout the study. They will also be instructed that they should 
report any new medications they are taking at each visit or telephone contract.  
The above assessments can be performed in any order except that it is recommended to perform 
physical examinations including vital signs prior to blood draws. If any of these assessments 
reveal that the subject is not eligible for the study, screening can be immediately terminated  and 
no further data be c ollected . Clinical chemistry tests  may be repeated at the discretion of the 
investigator if the first assessment yields values outside normal laboratory limits . The eligibility 
checklist will be reviewed, and i f the subject is still eligible after the asse ssments are completed 
at the first screening visit (or additional screening visits), the subject will be scheduled for the final eligibility check and baseline visit. It is recommended that hypertensive subject s be referred 
to their primary care physician for additional assessment and possible treatment , and then be 
further evaluated for study inclusion.  
7.5. Baseline and Final Eligibility Assessments  
If the subject is eligible after performing all the initial screening assessments, s/he will be 
scheduled to st art the study and will come to the clinic for a final eligibility check including the 
following assessments:

7.6. Measures Taken to Minimize/Avoid Bias  
7.6.1. Randomization  
If eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized in an approximate 1:1 ratio to receive either oxytocin or placebo using a stratified permuted block randomization procedure with “clinical site” as the stratification variable. Clinical site was chosen  because both local study populations, 
and the investigative staff influence on the subject’s drinking behaviors may differentially influence endpoints.  
Centralized randomization will be performed using an interactive web response system (IWRS). 
The IWRS is available for randomization of subjects 24 hours/day, 7 days/week from any 
computer using a web browser. 
If the subject is determined to be eligible, site personnel who are authorized to randomize 
subjects and who have completed training for the IWRS, will log onto the system and provide 
the EDMS pre -assigned unique s ubject  number. The IWRS provides the randomized group kit 
number and assigns the subject to one of the two interventions. If the subject is randomized and 
is never dispensed study drug, then the subject will be considered a randomization failure and an 
additional subject will be randomized with the next randomization sequence at the time he/she is randomized at that site . Likewise, if the subject was randomized and then is determined to not be 
eligible for the study, and never received study drug, then another subject will be randomized such that the total numbers of subjects who were eligible, randomized, and dispensed study drug meet the enrollment goals . In the case of a subject who was eli gible, randomized, and dispensed 
study drug but did not return for follow-up visits, this subject will not be replaced. Any subject who received study drug but was later determined to be ineligible will likewise not be replaced. The reason(s) that a subjec t was considered a randomization failure or screen failure will be 
documented in source documents and eCRFs. 
7.6.2. Blinding  
Oxytocin and placebo bottles  will be identically matched in appearance and the bottle labels will 
not reveal the drug identity. The site investigator or designated approved study physician will 
make the decision to un-blind the identity of the investigational product in the event that the 
study blind needs to be broken to make medical decisions regarding subject treatment. If it is determine d that unblinding is necessary to assess AEs or SAEs for expedited reporting, NIAAA 
may decide to  request  unblinding of a subject. Site staff or Sponsor’s designee approved to 
un-blind the study drug will log into the IWRS to obtain the name [CONTACT_566131]. The IWRS will automatically notify the un-blinded staff 
member at the Data Coordinating Center who will notify the Medical Monitor. NIAAA will be 
notified that an unblinding has occurred if unblinding has been performed by [CONTACT_10982].  Prior experience with oxytocin nasal spray compared with placebo nasal spray 
has not indicated that any differences would be noticed between formulations.

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) [ADDRESS_743536] is randomized, he/she will receive the first vial of intranasal 
investigational product, and an instruction sheet. The vial(s)  being dispensed will be weighed 
prior to providing it to the subject. Site staff will explain the dosing plan to th e subject  and how 
to complete a Diary Card  to track when  doses are taken. The subject will administer the  first dose 
while in the clinic on  Day [ADDRESS_743537] that 
identifie s the potential investigational products that s/he could be taking during the study. The 
card will provide the name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 24-hour phone number of the investigator (physician) at the site 
who can be contact[CONTACT_566082]. The card will also instruct the non-study 
physician rendering emergency care to contact [CONTACT_527952]/her about the care.  Prior to release from the clinic, the subject will be asked if they are experiencing any side 
effects from the first dose of investig ational product. 
If possible, clinic visits should be scheduled on the same day of the week that the subject received the first dose of study drug, but a 3-day window is allowed for conducting visits within 
the scheduled study week. Visits may be scheduled and conducted on any day of the week. Visits 
can be conducted outside of the scheduled study week, but only based upon subject request (e.g., for reasons related to patient non- compliance with the study schedule). Each subject will receive 
a visit schedul e to take home for future reference.  
7.8. Treatment Phase  
During Study Weeks [ADDRESS_743538] meets the BAC requirement of  a BAC ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_743539] concomitant medication use, administer 
questionnaires (CIWA- AR and C-SSRS), inquire about other medication use and assess drinking 
by [CONTACT_101608]. The UPSIT sniff card test and clinical chemistry, pregnancy test for women of child-
bearing potential and bi rth control methods (if female) will be collected in accordance with the 
schedule in Table [ADDRESS_743540] will be

Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) [ADDRESS_743541] site staff if they are 
experiencing any intolerable AEs and are contemplating drug discontinuation. 
Additional in -clinic  visits are permitted under the protocol, if needed, due to the following 
circumstances: (1) the subject has concerns either about the medication or their drinking and 
wishes to be seen at a time other than their next scheduled in-clinic visit, or, (2) the subject has missed a visit and wishes to resume regular participation before their next scheduled visit, (3) the 
subject has reported some change in health, functioning, or circumstances which necessitate a 
visit to conduct safety assessments and evaluate the risk of continued participation in the trial, or (4) clinical laboratory measurements need to be repeated.  
Subjects desiring additional counseling or professional therapy for non- crisis psychiatric matters 
(e.g., marital problems, work issues) should be encouraged if within reason to postpone such 
activity until their study participation is concluded. Attendance at self-help support groups (i.e., 
Alcoholics Anonymous) will neither be encouraged or discouraged. Any attendance at self- help 
support groups will be recorded at the randomization visit and  at the end of study visit in the 
Other Services Used for Alcohol Use Problems electronic case report form (eCRF).  
7.9. Telephone Assessments  
The brief telephone interview (approximately 10 minutes) will occur in  accordance with the 
schedule in Table [ADDRESS_743542] of the next scheduled visit. A summary of the telephone script follows: 
1. AEs: An open-ended question will be asked as follows: “How have you been feeling since your last clinic visit or phone contact ?” If the subject reports a new AE, the 
resolution of an AE, or a change in the severity of an AE, ask additional questions to determine the severity and dates of occurrence or resolution.  
2. Concomitant Medications: Ask the following question: “Have you taken any new 
medications since you were last seen in the clinic or since our last call? If the subject 
responds affirmatively, record the name [CONTACT_11889], the daily dose, route of administration, and reason used. If the medication is contraindicated for the study, notify a study physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant for follow-up with the subject. 
3. Drug Compliance: Ask the subject is s/he has been taking the nasal spray and check on the number of actuations they report using and if they have had any issues with the 
device. R eview procedures with the subject to ensure that the subjec t is taking the 
prescribed dose. 
4. Reminders: Remind the subject of their next scheduled clinic visit, and adjust the date 
within the visit week if they have a conflict.  
7.10. Final Clinic Visit  
The final clinic visit occurs during Week 13; at which time the subject has completed taking investig ational product. In addition to the assessments previously stated, subjects will have an 
Exit Interview assessment. The subject will be asked  about their impression of whether they  
were receiving active drug  or placebo, if they felt that the medication helped drinking, how they 
Oxytocin for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) [ADDRESS_743543] clinic visit and any newly emerged medical conditions/AEs since that visit. To prompt reporting of new AEs, the subject will also be asked about any ongoing or new medication use. 
7.12. Duration of Subject Participation  
The total time period that each individual subj ect will participate is 17 weeks  including up to 
2 weeks  for screening, 12  weeks of study interventions, the final safety and efficacy follow -up to 
one week aft er completing treatment (Week 1 3), and a final safety follow-up telephone contact 
1- to 2- week s after completion of study drug dosing (Week s 14/15). 
7.13. Safety Criteria for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_566035] s ub-investigator will follow the protocol to identify and intervene with subjects 
experiencing clinical deterioration during study participation. Criteria to determine when a 
subject requires a higher level of care and discontinuation from the trial intervention are detailed 
below.  
7.14. Investigational Product Discontinuation 
If the investigator determines that  any study s ubject should discontinue taking investigational 
products, the subject should be told to discontinue taking the investigational products 
immediately . No dose reduction is necessary in this case . Subjects should continue in the study, 
even if withdrawn from investigational products, and co mplete all assessments.  Dose reductions 
for intolerance are permitted (see section 6.7).  
Pregnancy. Females who become pregnant during the course of the study will be instructed to discontinue use of the investigational product immediately . The investigator must report a 
pregnancy within [ADDRESS_743544], then drug will be immediately discontinued as described above.

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 47 NIAAA Confidential   UPSIT Score.  If UPSIT score decreases to ≤ 26, study drug will be discontinued but the subject 
should continue in the study and be monitored using the UPSIT to determine if this AE is 
reversible. 
7.15. Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation Procedures  
Each subject has the ri ght to withdraw consent and withdraw from the study at any time. In 
addition, the investigator may find it necessary to discontinue a subject although it is 
recommended to continue to perform all study assessments, if possible.  
In the event that a subject withdraws or is discontinued from the study, the reason(s) for the 
discontinuation from the study will be recorded and the final end of study assessments shown in 
Table [ADDRESS_743545] suspended, and referred to more appropriate care.  
2. Psychiatric Crises.  Examples of psychiatric crises include but are not limited to the 
following: 
a. Acute psychosis (hallucinations, impaired reality testing, paranoid ideation, etc.) 
requiring medication and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527909];  
b. Suicidal or homicidal ideation that results in a credible threat of violence directed at oneself or others; 
c. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_566036]/homicidal behavior will be referred to local treatment centers, emergency departments, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4052], but will not be provided with medication or psychotherapy by [CONTACT_464].  
3. Absence from the Protocol due to Confinement in a Controlled Environment.  If a 
subject is confined to a controlled environment (such a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_566037]) for less than [ADDRESS_743546] should be assessed by [CONTACT_566083] (e.g. , any new medications or symptoms, pregnancy test, etc.). The decision to resta rt 
study drug at the full dose will be made in the judgment of the investigator based on the subject’s time off study drug and past experience with side effects with the study drug. 
If a subject is in a controlled environment (such a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_566038]) fo r [ADDRESS_743547] will be discontinued from the study.

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 51 NIAAA Confidential   9. Safety Monitoring Plan 
Safety monitoring will be conducted throughout the study; therefore safety concerns will be 
identified by [CONTACT_218909], clinic staff, clinical monitor, medical 
monitor, and NIAAA.  
Study Safety Management:  The IRB, Medical Monitor, PI, clinical monitors, and NIAAA will 
review any safety concerns throughout the trial. In addition, a data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will participate in this study. The roles of these indi viduals/committee are described 
below. 
Medical Monitor:  A Medical Monitor and Alternate Medical Monitor have been appointed by 
[CONTACT_566085]. The Medical Monitor will be available for making recommendations to 
the investigator and NIAAA on the severity of any SAEs, and the relatedness to the study 
interventions. The Medical Monitor will also be responsible for tracking and assessing trends in 
the AEs reported.  
Clinical Monitors: All investigators will allow representatives of the Data Coordinating Ce nter 
(Fast -Track Drugs and Biologics, LLC) staff to periodically monitor, at mutually convenient 
times during and after the study, all study data. These monitoring visits provide the Data 
Coordinating Center and NIAAA with the opportunity to evaluate the progress of the study and 
to obtain information about potential problems. The monitors will assure that submitted data are accurate and in agreement with any paper source documentation used; verify that investigational products are properly stored and accounted for, verify that subjects’ consent for study 
participation has been properly obtained and documented, confirm that research subjects entered 
into the study meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assure that all essential documentation required by [CONTACT_20148] (GCP) guidelines are appropriately filed. 
Monitors will conduct a site initiation visit prior to the start of the study. At this visit, they will 
assure that proper study-related documentation exists, assist in training investigators and other site personnel in study procedures and GCP guidelines, confirm receipt of study supplies, and assure that acceptable facilities are available to conduct the study.  
Routine monitoring visits by [CONTACT_566086]’s representa tives will be 
scheduled at appropriate intervals but more frequently at the beginning of the study. A 
monitoring visit soon after the first two subjects have been randomized is planned. At these 
visits, the monitors will verify that study procedures are being conducted according to the protocol guidelines, monitor eCRFs against source documents, review AEs and SAEs, and 
perform drug accountability. At the end of the study, they will confirm that the site has the 
appropriate essential documents on file, advise on storage of study records, and inspect the return and destruction records for unused investigational products.  
Sponsor Site Visits:  All investigators will allow NIAAA full access to study records during 
periodic site visits by [CONTACT_50533]. Visits by [CONTACT_566087]  a mutually convenient time and 
will be scheduled in advance. DSMB: An independent DSMB of external advisors will meet prior to the start of the study, 
quarterly during enrollment and follow-up and at trial end to review safety data. The Boa rd will 
be blinded to subjects’ actual randomized group assignments but may request at any time that the

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 53 NIAAA Confidential   10. Assessment  Methods  
All study assessments will be performed at the visits and time points outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 3 ); the following sections outline the details and procedures associated with 
the assessments.  All assessments will be recorded on a source document with the exception of 
staff or subject completed questionnaires that will be completed electronically within the EDMS . 
If the EDMS is not accessible, then subject questionnaires can be completed using paper forms 
provided by [CONTACT_566088]. 
10.1. Alcohol Breathalyzer  
An alcohol breathalyzer will be administered at consent, at screening, and at every in- clinic visit 
as a safety measure. Acceptable BAC level at consent  is equal to 0.000 and ≤  0.[ADDRESS_743550] a causal relationship with 
the administered treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including a clinically significant laboratory abnormality), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational 
product . Pre-existing conditions, diseases, or disorders are not considered AEs unless there is a 
change in severity or  frequency.  
10.2.2. Serious Adverse Events and Serious Unexpected Adverse Events Definition  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that meets one of the following: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (a t the time of the event)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
A serious and unexpected AE is an SAE that is not identified in nature, intensity, or frequency in 
the ri sk information included in the Product Label for the drug. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the study subject  and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  
Oxytocin for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 54 NIAAA Confidential   10.2.3. Methods/Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Endpoints  
AEs will be assessed at study visits starting after the first administration of investigational 
product until the final follow -up visit. However, SAEs will be collected from the time of 
informed consent onward. General symptoms will be collected  via an open- ended  question: 
“How have you been feeling since your last visit or the last time we spoke ?”  
AEs will be documented in the source reco rds and  recorded on the eCRFs using accepted 
medical terms and/or the diagnoses that accurately characterize the event. When a diagnosis is 
known, the AE term recorded on the eCRF will be the diagnosis rather than a constellation of 
symptoms. The investiga tor will assess all AEs for seriousness, relationship to investigational 
product, and severity. When an event has not resolved by [CONTACT_138114], it will be documented on 
the AE eCRF as “ongoing”. 
If a woman has a positive pregnancy test after enrollment, t he NIAAA Medical Monitor will be 
contact[CONTACT_566089]. The site will contact [CONTACT_566090]’s status until the pregnancy has been terminated or completed. 
The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the NIAAA Medical Monitor without delay 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event if the outcome is a SAE (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  
All AE s, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless 
of severity, will be followed by [CONTACT_218911] (the event either 
resolved or stabilized and is not expected to resolve in the near term). AEs must be reported up 
to [ADDRESS_743551], AEs will be recorded and followed to resolution only if they 
are serious, or if the study physician assesses them to be clinically significant.  
10.2.4. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments 
Abnormal clinical laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry) will be reported as an AE unless the value was outside normal laboratory limits at baseline and did not increase by a severity 
grade level at the follow -up assessment. Grade [ADDRESS_743552] will be considered clinically significant.  Likewise if blood 
pressure was elevated at baseline [p re-hypertension (systolic BP 120 - 139 mmHg or diastolic BP 
80 - 89 mmHg) ] and increased to a level indicative of an increase in the severity grade, 
hypertension will be reported as an AE.  
10.2.5. Classification of Adverse Event Intensity and Relationship to Investigational 
Product  
The severity of AEs or SAE s will be in accordanc e with the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 5.0). A physician- investigator must 
make an assessment of severity.  For those not listed in the CTCAE, the following criteria  will be 
used: 
Oxytocin for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 55 NIAAA Confidential   Mild:  An event that is usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and does 
not generally interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
Moderate:  An event that interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject . The event is usually ameliorated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention.  
Severe:   An event that interrupts usual activities of daily living or significantly affects clinical status. The event poses a significant risk of harm to the subject  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_481911], and typi[INVESTIGATOR_527916]. 
The investigator must make an assessment of relationship to the investigational product based on 
the following criteria:  
Unrelated:  The subject did not receive the investigational product, the temporal sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration  of the investigational product 
is not reasonable, or there is another obvious cause of the AE/SAE. 
Unlikely:  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product but there is another more likely cause of the AE/SAE. 
Possible:  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal 
sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product is reasonable, but the AE/SAE could have been due to another equally likely cause.  
Probable:  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal 
sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product is reasonable, and the AE/SAE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_218913].  
Definite  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product is reasonable, the AE/SAE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_218913], and the AE/SAE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the investigational product or investigational product class. 
10.2.6. Outcomes and Actions Taken  
All unresolved AEs will be followed for a minimum of 7 days (unless the AE is an ongoing 
pregnancy which must be followed to conclusion) after the subject’s final study visit, unless the 
investigator’s judgment dictates otherwise, the event has resolved or stabilized prior to the 7-day 
period, or the subject  is los t to follow -up.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects that occur following the follow-up period.  
For each recorded AE or SAE, the investigator must make an assessment of outcome at the time 
of last observation, as follows: 
Oxytocin for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 56 NIAAA Confidential   Fatal:  The subject  died.  
Resolved  without S equelae: The AE or SAE has ended. 
Resolved with Sequelae: The AE or SAE has ended but changes are noted from 
baseline.  
Unresolved – Ongoing:  The AE has not ended and is ongoing at the end of the 
reporting period (i.e., 7 days after the final Follow -up visit) and 
the investigator deems that further follow up is not medically required  
Unknown – Lost to Follow-up: Lost to follow- up after repeated  unsuccessful attempts to 
contact [CONTACT_423] . 
Actions taken with respect to investigational agents (discontinuation or not) will also be 
recorded. In addition, if the AE was treated (medications or other physical measures), this will also be recorded. 
10.2.7. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. 24 hour Reporting Requirements (Initial Report)  
Any SAE, including death due to any cause, which occurs to any subject from the time of 
signing consent through the final follow -up visit whether or not related to t he investigational 
product, must be reported within 24 hours  of knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_149729]/SAE 
eCRF. This will trigger an automatic notification of the SAE via an email communication to NIAAA and Fast-Track. Fast -Track will notify the Medical Monitors upon receipt of the 
notification and coordinate communications with the Medical Monitors.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. 3-Day Supporting Documentation Requirements (Follow -up Report)  
Written documentation for all SAEs must be received by [CONTACT_227083] A Medical Monitor/Alternate 
within [ADDRESS_743553] be completed include the 
following:

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 57 NIAAA Confidential   [IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting to Advarra  IRB  
Reporting requirements for Advarra IRB include: 
Immediately Reportable: 
• Findings detected in the monitoring process when those findings could affect the 
safety of participants or their willingness to continue participation, influence the conduct of the study, or alter Advarra ’s approval to continue the study. 
• Changes in research that were initiated without IRB review and approval to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazards to the human subjects to ensure the continued safety and welfare of subjects .  
• Modifications to previously approved documents. 
• Safety informatio n that may help to provide additional protections for subject’s safety 
and well -being, throughout the course of the study and after study completion. 
• Communication of results from a research study to subjects when those results directly affect their safety  or medical care.  
• DSMB Reports  
Report within 10 calendar days of discovery: 
• Revisions to the Investigator's Brochure, as applicable.  
• Revisions to the report of prior investigations, as applicable.  
• Non-compliance – Failure by [CONTACT_566093]/or sponsor to follow Advarra’s 
requirements, applicable regulations or to protect human research subjects, including but not limited to the principles of the Belmont Report ‘Serious non- compliance 
issues – non-compliance as defined as above and as determined to be serious in a way 
that adversely affects the rights and welfare of human subjects following the 
investigation and review by [CONTACT_566094]- compliance issues – A pattern of 
repeated non -compliance or serious non- compliance as determined by [CONTACT_1201] . 
• Significant deviations – Significant deviations are those that deviate from the 
approved protocol, informed consent process and affect or potentially affect the safety 
of subjects. Advarra does not consider protocol deviations to be different from protocol violations. 
• Unanticipated adverse device effects .  
• Unanticipated problems should be reported regardless of whether they occur during the study, after the study completion, or after participant withdrawal or completion. 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others that are (1) 
unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol- related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject  population being studied; (2) related or possibly related 
to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_566095], NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 58 NIAAA Confidential   procedures in the research); and (3) suggests that the research places subjects or 
others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or 
social harm) than was previously known or recognized. Examples of problems or events that may meet the definition of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others may include, but are not limited to the following:  
− Imminent threat of a reportable event that has not yet occurred  
− Information indicating a change to the risk/benefit ratio of the research  
− Death  
− Breach o f confidentiality, including lost or stolen study documents/data  
10.3. Barrett Impulsiveness Scale  
The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS -11; Patton-1995) is a questionnaire designed to assess the 
personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness. It is a 30- item scale with items scored on a 
4-point scale (1=rarely/never; 2= occasionally; 3=often; 4=almost always/always). Items 1, 7, 8, 
9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 20, 29, and [ADDRESS_743554] electronically and will be both the 
source and eCRF.  
10.4. Buss Perry Aggression Questionnaire – Short Form  (BPAQ -SF) 
The BPAQ- SF is a 12- item self -report measure that includes four subscales: physical aggression 
(4 items), verbal aggression (3 items), anger ( 2 items), and hostility (3 items) validated by 
[CONTACT_566096] (2006)  that was developed from the 29- item scale developed by [CONTACT_566097] (1992) . There is no time frame specified, and i tems are rated using a five- point scale 
from 1 “very unlike me ” to 5 “very like me” with the score as the sum of the scores  obtained by 
a respondent for the individual factors. This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_566098]. 
10.5. Cigarette Smoking Quantity -Frequency  and Other Nicotine Use  
A smoking quantity frequency and nicotine use interview will include 3 questions to assess 
nicotine use via cigarette smoking or via other products during the study: 1) Over the past week, 
on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?; 2) On the days you smoked during the past week, 
how many cigarettes did you smoke on average?; and 3) Over the past week, on how many days 
did you use other nicotine products (ex. chew, cigars, cigarellos, e-cigarettes, vape, gum, patch, etc...)? This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_566099].  
10.6. Clinical Institute Withdrawal Asses sment for Alcohol -revised (CIWA -AR) 
The CIWA -AR modified telephone version is an adaptation for telephone administration of the 
CIWA -AR a brief 10 -item measure used to provide a quantitative index of the severity of the 
alcohol withdrawal syndrome ( Sullivan-1989). The CIWA -AR has been used both in clinical and 
research applications and has demonstrated both reliability and validity ( Sellers -1992, 
Stuppaeck-1994 ). This questionnaire will be administered by a clinical staff member and subject 
responses will be recorded electronically and will be both the source and eCRF.

Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 59 NIAAA Confidential   10.7. Clinical Chemistry  
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at the clinical site’s local clinical laboratory. 
Laboratories performing these assessments should be directly regulated by [CONTACT_36460] ( CAP ) or Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act ( CLIA ) guidelines . The 
laboratory will need to provide a copy of current certification. Additional laboratory samples 
may be taken at the discretion of the investigator if the results of any tests fall outside reference 
ranges or clinical symptoms necessitate testing to en sure safety. Clinical chemistry tests  are 
listed below . 
• Creatinine  
• Total bilirubin  
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  
• Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  
• Sodium 
• Potassium 
Serum creatinine levels will be used to calculate creatinine clearance (CrCl) according to the Cockroft-Gault (1976)  formula as follows:  
Males  CrCl (mL/min) =  (140 – age in years) x body weight in kg  
72 x serum creatinine mg/dL 
 
Females  CrCl (mL/min) =  0.85 x (140 – age in years) x body weight in kg  
72 x serum creatinine mg/dL  
For any laboratory test value outside the reference range that the invest igator considers clinically 
significant: 
• The investigator will repeat the test to verify the out-of- range value  
• The investigator will follow the out-of- range value to a s atisfactory clinical resolution  
• A laboratory test value will be reported as an  AE with the severity score assigned in 
accordance with the CTCAE version 5.0 
10.8. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS is a 4 -page form asking questions about suicidal ideation, intensity of ideation, and 
suicidal behavior developed by [CONTACT_566100] ( Oquendo-2003). This scale is intended for use by [CONTACT_411974]. The questions 
contained in the C-SSRS are suggested probes. Ultimately, the determination of the presence of 
suicidality depends on clinical judgment. Training is required before administering the C- SSRS 
through a 30-minute interactive slide presentation followed by a question- answer se ssion through 
the Columbia University Medical Center. Those completing the training are certified to administer the C -SSRS, and will receive a training certificate. As the MINI will be used to 
establish subject initial eligibility with respect to suicidality, the “Since Last Visit” version of the C-SSRS will be used at each cl inic visit starting at Week 1. At Week 1, this scale will be used to 
assess current suicidal ideation since the MINI interview. This questionnaire will be

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) [ADDRESS_743555]’s age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, 
employment pattern , occupation, and income level. These data will be collected by [CONTACT_566101] a 
source document and entered into an eCRF. 
10.10. Device Issues/Failures  
The subject will be asked to report any issues using the nasal spray and record the issue on their 
Drug Diary. If a nasal spray pump failure occurs (e.g., no spray is coming out), then the subject 
will be asked to call the number on the wallet card to make  arrangements to obtain a replacement 
nasal spray  vial. The site will notify Fast-Track of any device problems within 24- hours after 
learning of the problem. A eCRF will be provided for reporting problems. 
10.11. Drinking Goal  
A subject’s drinking goal will be assessed to determine the desire and motivation to completely 
abstain from drinking alcohol or reduce drinking without abstinence. 
The Drinking Goal Questionnaire includes 4- items that will be administered by a member of the 
study staff. The questions include:  
1. What goal have you chosen for yourself about drinking by [CONTACT_2054]? 
a. To stop drinking 
b. Reduce drinking but not stop 
2. Subjects who respond to question 1 with “Reduce drinking but not stop” will be asked to 
estimate, having achieved their drinking goal, the number of drinks they might consume 
on each day of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_3711].  
All subjects will be asked questions capturing: 
3. The level of motivation to reach this goal. Responses are a 1 to 10 scale with 1=not 
motivated and 10 = extremely motivated. 
4. The level of confidence to reach this goal. Responses are a 1 to 10 scale with 1=not confident and 10 = extremely confident. 
10.12. Brief Drinking Question naire 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study early and is no longer participating in clinic visits or providing TLFB drinking data but is willing to be contact[CONTACT_566102], then they will be administered the Brief Drinking Questionnaire. The questions are 
taken from the list recommended by [CONTACT_566103] (Oct 15-16, 2003) and ascertain: if there was any drinking during the target period; if 
so, how many a day on average; the largest number of drinks consumed on any one day; and, the 
number of times reaching the heavy drinking limit (4 or more for women and 5 or more for men). This data will be recorded on a source document and eCRF. This does not apply to subjects who are willing to supply daily drinking data by [CONTACT_566104].

10.14. Exit Interview  
At the final in -clinic visit (or by [CONTACT_566105]) , the subject will complete 
a questionnaire for his/her impression of whether he/she was receiving active drug or placebo, if 
they felt that the medication helped drinking, how they would describe their experience taking 
the medication, if they would recommend it to a friend, if they would take it again if they needed further treatment in the future, and a question about desire to please people. This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_566099].

for identifying blood relatives with alcohol problems by [CONTACT_2329] a family tree listing f or relatives 
(Mann-1985). This questionnaire will be restricted to subject’s  parents’ alcohol history. The 
questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_566106].  
10.17. Hyperkatifeia Questionnaire  
Hyperkatifeia is referred to as an exacerbated negative emotional state during drug and alcohol withdrawal characterized as emotional distress and pain. Hyperkatifeia falls within the negativ e 
affect stage of the addiction cycle where i ndividuals experiencing hyperkatifeia are vulnerable to 
relapse to alcohol or drug use motivated by [CONTACT_566107] (Koob-1997; Koob-2019 ). Negative reinforcement becomes the source of motivation to a person 
to prevent hyperkatifeia of alcohol and drug withdrawal ( Koob-2021) . Koob (2021)  postulates: 
“Although all drugs of abuse have positive reinforcing properties, the termination of drug taking inevitably leads to negative emotional states of acute and protracted withdrawal in the 
withdrawal/negative affect stage, which generates a second  motivational drive from negative 
reinforcement. Negative reinforcement can be defined as an increase in the probability of a 
response that is produced by [CONTACT_566108]. Here, negative reinforcement 
becomes the source of motivation for drug seeking as the individual works to reduce, terminate, 
or prevent the negative emotional state or hyperkatifeia of drug withdrawal.”  
Oxytocin for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 62 NIAAA Confidential   Negative emotionality has been shown to be particularly important in predicting alcohol 
treatment outcomes ( Votaw -2020). Individuals with comorbid diagnoses of depression or anxiety 
tend to have higher AUD severity entering treatment and greater drinking and functional 
impairment following treatment ( Burns-2005). Furthermore, changes in negative affect have 
been shown to play a mediating role in alcohol treatment outcomes ( Wilcox -2018).  
NIAAA has developed a 24- item self -report Hyperkatifeia Scale to capture negative emotionality 
after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_566040] a diagnosis of moderate to severe AUD. The items address four measures 
associated with negative emotional state including stress/anxiety, depression, stress, irritable and pain and is provided in Appendix C . It takes  less than two minutes to complete.  
One major distinction between the Hyperkatifeia Scale and other negative emotional state scales is the Hyperkatifeia Scale directly  links negative emotional state to the absence of alcohol.  
Another key difference between this scale and other negative emotional state scales is questions 
directly related to pain. Pain may be particularly important in AUD and hyperkatifeia as there is 
a positive association between pain severity and a higher risk for AUD ( Lawton - 2009; Edlund-
2013). Also, physical pain appears to be a significant predictor of alcohol use and heavy alcohol 
use and relapse to drinking after a period of abstinence ( Larson -2007; Caldeiro -2008; 
Witkiewitz -2015).  
This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_566109].  
10.18. Inventory of Drinking Situations (IDS-30) 
The IDS -[ADDRESS_743558] and relief drinking that asks 
subjects to rate the frequency (0= never, 3 = almost always)  of heavy drinking in various 
situations over the past year. Fifteen items measure reward drinking tendencies and 15 items measure relief drinking tendencies ( Mann-2017 ). This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_566110].  
10.19. Locator Form 
After signing informed consent, subjects will be asked to provide names, addresses, and phone 
numbers of several friends and/or family members who can be contact[CONTACT_566111] (Locator Form). This locator form will be used to assist in contact[CONTACT_566112] -up. This form asks subjects his/her name, address, and phone number and to 
provide names, addresses, and phone numbers of several friends and family members who can be 
contact[CONTACT_566111]. This information is essential and will be collected 
during screening and  will be updated throughout the study as necessary. This information will 
remain exclus ively at the site.  
10.20. Medical/Surgical  History  
A medical history will be taken for all potential study subjects to assure medical fitness during screening. Current and past year chronic r hinitis  will be specifically queried  as this is 
exclusionary. Chronic rhinitis is defined as symptoms of rhinitis lasting longer than 6 weeks. 
Signs and symptoms of rhinitis may include stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, phlegm in the throat 
(postnasal drip) and cough. The age at which the subject started drinking alcohol regularly at

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) [ADDRESS_743559] 3 times per month (age of onset) will also be collected as part of the medical history. Dates 
of prior surgeries will be recorded. 
The medical /surgical history will be updated on the day planned for randomization by [CONTACT_566113].  
10.21. MINI  
The MINI (paper version 7.0.2) is a short structured diagnostic interview, developed jointly by 
[CONTACT_242574], for DSM -5 and ICD -10 psychiatric 
disorders ( Sheehan-1998 ). With an administration time of approximately [ADDRESS_743560] study visit, the 
Alcohol Use Disorders Module will be assessed again, but the initial drinkin g question will not 
be asked and the time period for which the questions apply has been revised to “the past month” 
instead of the past 12 months. 
10.22. Other Services Used for Alcohol Use Problems  
Prior (lifetime) treatment for alcohol problems and drinking will be collected  at baseline. The 
answers to the following questions will be collected:  
1. Number of lifetime inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (i.e. at least one overnight stay) to get help 
with reducing or quitting drinking. 
2. Number of lifetime inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (i.e. at least one overnight stay) for illnesses, injuries, or accidents due to drinking. 
3. Number of times in lifetime underwent alcohol detoxification using medication.  
4. Number of lifetime outpatient visits (i.e. no overnight stay) with a health professional to get help with reducing or quitting drinking. 
5. In the past year, how many alcoholics anonymous (AA), [ADDRESS_743561] will be interviewed about attendance at group meetings [ AA, 
12-step programs, secular organizations for sobriety ( SOS), or similar group meetings] and visits 
with health professionals for assistance in reducing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_566041] 12- week 
treatmen t period. Use of additional counseling or professional therapy for non- crisis psychiatric 
matters or any additional pharmacologic or non- pharmacologic treatments received will be 
documented. This questionnaire will be administered by a clinical staff membe r and subject ’s 
responses will be recorded electronically and will be both the source and eCRF.

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 64 NIAAA Confidential   10.23. Profile of Mood State (POMS)  
The POMS measures dimensions of affect or mood ( McNair and Heuchert-2005). It consists of 
[ADDRESS_743562] responds according to a 5-point scale ranging from “not at all” 
to “extremely.” Six subscale scores will be computed for items grouped as follows: Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Dejection, Anger- Hostility, Vigor -Activity, Fatigue -Inertia, and 
Confusion-Bewilderment. A total mood disturbance score will also be computed which consists of the sum of the 5 of the six subscale scores (the Vigor-Activity score is not included). This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_566099].  
10.24. Pregnancy Test and Birth Control Record  
An FDA approved rapid result urine pregnancy test will be used (i.e., dipstick test). If applicable, subjects will be asked to sign a release of information form for study personnel to access me dical 
records to obtain information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy that occurred during the study. 
The Birth Control Assessment is designed to determine a female subject’s compliance with the 
birth control specifications detailed in the inclusion cri teria.

All medications taken by [CONTACT_423] 2-months prior to the start of screening, during the screening period, and through the final follow-up contact [CONTACT_566114] a source document and eCRF.   
10.26. PROMIS Questionna ires 
PROMIS® (Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) is a set of person-
centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health in adults and 
children that were developed through the support of U. S. Department of Health and Human 
Services. See http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore- measurement -systems/promis for a 
description of the development of these assessments. Three of these assessments, described below, will be utilized in this study.  
10.26.1. Patient -Reported Outc omes Measurement Information System  (PROMIS ) – 
Alcohol Use Negative Consequences – Long Form 
For negative consequences for alcohol use, t he long form of the PROMIS Alcohol Negative 
Consequences questionnaire will be used to assess outcomes of alcohol use o ver the past 30 
days. This 31- item questionnaire assesses drinking patterns (e.g., quantity and frequency of 
consumption, time spent drinking, epi[INVESTIGATOR_20181]), cue-based drinking (internal states and external contexts), cravings to drink (e.g., urgency, compulsivity), and efforts to 
control drinking (e.g., difficulty in limiting drinking) that indicate problematic drinking, 
particularly at the high end of the severity continuum. The PROMIS Alcohol Negative Consequences questionnaire is completed by [CONTACT_566099] .

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 65 NIAAA Confidential   10.26.2. PROMIS – Sleep Disturbances – Short From 8b 
For assessment of subject’s sleep quality , the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Short Form 8b will be 
used. The questionnaire consists of [ADDRESS_743563] 7 
days. Each item on the measure is rated on a 5 -point scale with a range of scores from 8 to 40 
with higher scores indicating greater severity of sleep disturbance. The American Psychiatric 
Association has established  levels of severity ( none to slight, mild, moderate or severe based on 
the T -score derived from a conversion table). The PROMIS Sleep Disturbance questionnaire 
completed by [CONTACT_566099] . 
10.26.3. PROMIS – Pain Interference – Short Form 8a  
For the assessment of  pain interference,  the shortened 8a version of the PROMIS for pain 
interference will be used to measure the self -reported consequences of pain over the past [ADDRESS_743564] electronically and will be both the source and eCRF. 
10.27. Physical Examination 
A physical examination of the oral cavity, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, cardiovascular 
system, lungs, abdomen, extremities, skin, neuropsychiatric mental status and sensory/motor 
status, musculoskeletal system and general appearance will be performed during screening. The  
nasal exam should specifically assess any nasal lesions that could be affected by [CONTACT_566115] , as this may be exclusionary. The physical exam will be updated on 
the day planned for randomization by [CONTACT_566116]. An examination of the nasal mucosa will be performed again at Week [ADDRESS_743565] reports any 
problems. Weight (pounds ) will be collected per the schedule in  Table [ADDRESS_743566] Was Not Eligible eCRF will be completed for these subjects.  
10.29. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_528218] (STAI) 
The Spi[INVESTIGATOR_73593] -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) has been used extensively in research and 
clinical practice ( Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2996]-1983). The fundamental qualities evaluated by [CONTACT_566117], tension, nervousness, a nd worry . The assessment includes separate 
self-report scales for measuring state and trait anxiety. Only the trait anxiety scale will be 
collected in this study. The T-Anxiety scale (STAI Form Y- 2) named on the form as “Self 
Evalua tion Spi[INVESTIGATOR_566042]” consists of [ADDRESS_743567] electronicall y and will be both the 
source and eCRF.

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 66 NIAAA Confidential   10.30. Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ)  
Oxytocin reduces appetite, body weight, reward and hunger driven eating. The 8- item Council on 
Nutrition appetite questionnaire scale and its 4- item derivative The  Simplified Nutritional 
Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ) were developed to assess appetite and predict weight loss. The 
changes in appetite during the study will be evaluated using the clinically simpler version of the 
two scales, the SNAQ ( Wilson -2005). The 4 item SNAQ asks: 1) My appetite is ; 2) When I eat; 
3: Food tastes; and 4) Normally I eat; with 5 possible responses that are scored numerically from 
1 to 5. The sum of the responses is the total scale score. A SNAQ score ≤[ADDRESS_743568] 5% weight loss within six months. This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_566110]. 
10.31. Subject Disposition  
A subject disposition eCRF will be completed for all subjects who are randomized to the study 
and who are dispensed investigational product. This eCRF will be used to record the following 
data as applicable: 1) completion status of the subject at the end of their participation and if they were discontinued early, and reason for early discontinuation. 
Completion status is as follows: 
1. Subject completed full study (i.e., telephone contact [CONTACT_566118] 14/15 follow-
up). 
2. Subject completed  the full intervention phase of the study (i.e., subject came to Week 13 
clinic visit – during Week 13).  
3. Subject was withdrawn prior to the Week 13 visit, but completed the end of study assessments scheduled at Week 13 (reasons for early withdrawal are to be specified). 
4. Subject was withdrawn  prior to the Week 13 visit and did not complete the end of study 
assessments (reasons for early withdr awal are to be specified).  
5. Subject d iscontinued investigational products and the reason(s). 
Even if the subject had investigational product suspended for any reason but attended clinic visits, the above definitions still apply. 
In addition, if the subject was confined and/or incarcerated at any time during the study, the dates 
of confinement and/or incarceration will be collected. 
10.32. TLFB Interview  
Drinking behavior will be assessed using the TLFB methodology ( Sobell & Sobell-1992). The 
TLFB is a semi -structured interview that provides estimates of the daily quantity of alcohol 
consumption during specified time periods. It uses a calendar prompt and a number of other 
memory  aids (e.g., holidays, payday, and other personally relevant dates) to facilitate accurate 
recall of drinking or other drug use during the target period. The procedure has been widely used in clinical and research contexts. It has demonstrated adequate lev els of reliability and validity 
when administered as an in -person interview, over the telephone, and when administered via 
computer ( Carey -1997, Sobell-1988, Sobell-1996). After consent is signed, the TLFB interview 
will be performed for the 28-day period prior to signing consent. Thereafter, the interview will

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) [ADDRESS_743569] drink units (SDUs). This spreadsheet will be reviewed, compared with source documents and collected by [CONTACT_566119]. 
Drinking days are defined as the number of days in which the subject reported any alcohol 
consumption (i.e., > [ADDRESS_743570] drinking units [SDUs]). A standard drink contains approximately 0.6 fluid ounces (oz) of pure alcohol. The data given by [CONTACT_566120](s) consumed will be converted to SDUs. Standard drink unit definitions are provided in Table 5.  
Table 5: Standard Drink Unit Definitions  
For beer (~ 5% alcohol) , the approximate number of SDUs in:  
• 12 oz = 1.0  
• 16 oz = 1.3 
• 24 oz = 2. 0 
• 40 oz = 3.3 
For malt liquor  (~ 7% alcohol), the approximate number of SDUs in: 
• 12 oz = 1.4 
• 16 oz = 1.9 
• 22 oz = 2.6 
• 40 oz = 4.7 
For table wine  (~ 12% alcohol) , the approximate number of SDUs in:  
• 750 mL bottle = 25oz = 5.0 • 5 oz glass = 1.0 
• 10 oz glass = 2. 0 
For 80 proof spi[INVESTIGATOR_2120]  (~ 40% alcohol) , or hard liquor, the approximate number of 
SDUs in:  
• 1.5 oz (mixed drink) = 1 .0 
• 12.7 oz (pi[INVESTIGATOR_11731]) = 8.5 • 25 oz ( a fifth) = 17.0 
• 1.75 L (59 oz) = 39 .0 
10.33. World Health Organization Drinking Risk Categorical Scale 
The WHO has developed a drinking risk categorical scale that can be used in a responder 
analysis approach to assess clinically relevant decreases in alcohol consumption ( Aubin-2015). 
Two dichotomous endpoints will be analyzed: WHO 1- level and WHO 2 -level decrease in 
alcohol consumption. The  WHO 1- and 2- level decrease endpoints are the percentage of subjects 
Oxytocin for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -007R  
Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) [ADDRESS_743571] a 1- and 2- level  decrease in WHO levels of alcohol consumption, 
respectively,  from the level at  baseline (the period including the 28 days before screening) to the 
level during the treatment phase ( e.g., Study Weeks 9-12).  
The WHO levels of average alcohol consumption per day are as follows: 
               Males               Females  
Low Risk         1 to 40g            1 to 20g 
Medium Risk     41 to 60g          21 to 40g 
High Risk       61 to 100g        41 to 60g 
Very High Risk  101+g               61+g 
where 14g = 1 SDU ( WHO -2000). In computing the WHO alcohol consumption level, average 
drinks per day will be used, computed as the sum of all drinks in the 28 day period divided by 
[CONTACT_273575]-missing drinking data in that period. Abstinent subjects will be included in a separate “Abstinent” category .  
10.34. University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test 
The UPSIT will be assessed at screen ing and at clinic visits shown in Table 3  to determine if 
intranasal investigational products cause any changes in sensory discrimination. It consists of 4 
booklets each containing 10 microencapsulated (scratch and sniff) odors. The UPSIT test has 
been studied in individuals with alcohol addiction and has shown that this population generally had generally lower UPSIT scores th at non-drinking controls. Ditralgilia (1991)  reported that: 
“Thirty -two percent of the alcoholics' UPSIT scores, in comparison to five percent of the 
controls' scores, fell into the clinically impaired range. Although current smoking patterns correlated significantly with UPSIT indices, comparisons limited to nonsmokers still indicated 
that the alcoholics were significantly impaired on this olfactory task”.  Anosm ia (loss of sense of 
smell) and microsmia (reduced ability to smell) will be reported as AEs when the following 
scores are reported: anosmia: score of 6 - 18, severe microsmia: score between 19 and 25, 
moderate microsmia: 26 - 30 in women and 26 - 29 in me n, mild microsmia: 31 - 34 in women 
and 30 - 33 in men Normosmia (not an AE ) is a score of more than [ADDRESS_743572] present s with clinically impaired values at baseline, numeric decreases  in the score 
will be reported as an AE  when the score decreases to a more severe level of microsmia or 
anosmia.   
10.35. Urge- to-Drink Questionnaire  
The Urge to Drink Scale is a modified version of an assessment that was developed and validated by [CONTACT_566121]’s Center for Studies of Addiction 
(Flannery-1999 ). This measure has been shown to be a valid and reliable instrument for 
assessing an individual’s urge to drink alcohol. Total scores of [ADDRESS_743573] been reported to be associated with increased risk for relapse ( Flannery-1999); 
Flannery-2003).  This scale  has [ADDRESS_743574] week. The total score is the sum of the point scores for the 
individual items.

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) [ADDRESS_743575] will be used to ass ess candidates for recent 
use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (i.e., morphine test), cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine, THC, 
buprenorphine, methadone, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], oxycodone, barbiturates, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA  – also known as ecstasy) . During screening subjects must be 
negative for all substances except THC  and in special cases opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. If positive for opi[INVESTIGATOR_566043], then the subject can be re-screened. If 
positive for these drugs at other times during the study, the subject will not be removed from the 
study but should be asked about medication use and possibly have re -evaluat ion of their medical 
history for substance abuse. 
10.37. Vital Signs  
Vital signs to be assessed include sitting  blood pressure and pulse rate (after sitting  for at least 3 
minutes).

11.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Complete details of the statistical analyses to be perfor med will be documented in a SAP, which 
will be completed prior to locking and unblinding the study data. This document will include 
more detail of planned statistical analyses and additional exploratory analyses. Any changes to the final SAP  will be outlin ed in the final study report. 
11.2. Statistical Hypotheses  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  It is hypothesized that oxytocin, as compared to placebo will 
reduce the weekly percentage of heavy drinking days over the 10- week maintenance treatment 
period. This hypothesis will be tested  using other time periods during treatment. 
Secondary Efficacy Drinking and Smoking Endpoints:  
Over the 10- week maintenance treatment period, it is hypothesized that the oxytocin group, as 
compared to the placebo group, will: 
1. Increase the p ercentage of subjects with no heavy drinking days 
2. Increase the percentage of subjects abstinent from alcohol   
3. Increase the percentage of subjects with a WHO drinking risk category decrease of  at 
least: 
a.  1-level  
b.  2-level s  
4. Increase the percent age of days abstinent per week  
5. Decease the weekly mean number of drinks per week   
6. Decrease the weekly mean drinks per drinking day 
7. Decrease the cigarettes smoked per week  among smokers 
8. Increase the smoking abstinence rate among smokers  
9. Decrease the weekly number of days of nicotine use among nicotine users 
10. Decrease in attachment related anxiety scores of the ECR -RS  
11. Decrease in PROMIS sleep disturbance, alcohol negative consequences, and pain interference scores  
12. Decrease in POMS subscale tension -anxiety and depression scores 
13. Decrease in the Urge to Drink scale scores  
11.3. Analysis Populations 
The study analysis populations will consist of the following:

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 71 NIAAA Confidential   Full Analysis Set:  The full set is defined as subjects randomized to participate in the study who 
took at least one dose of investigational product. The full analysis set will be used to evaluate all 
efficacy and safety endpoints. 
11.4. Description of Statistical Methods  
11.4.1. General Approach  
For descriptive purposes, dichotomous and categorical variables will be presented as number of 
observations and percentages; continuous variables will be given as means, standard deviations 
(SD), median, minimum (min) and maximum (max). Statistical tests will be two -tailed at a 0.05 
Type I error rate. P -values for the primary and secondary endpoints of < 0.05 will be considered 
statistically significant. The SAP will define the covariate selection process.  Endpoint data will 
also be screened for outliers and skewness. Appropriate non- parametric tests will be used to 
compare treatment groups on continuous baseline characteristics that are not normally 
distributed. Continuous endpoint data that are not normally distributed will be transformed. 
Cohen’s d will be used to calculate the effect size for means and Cohen’s h will be used  to 
calculate the effect size for proportions. Odds ratios will be provided for all dichotomous 
outcomes and least squares means will be provided for all continuous endpoints. Descriptive 
statistics – mean, SD, median, min and max – of all endpoint data will be provided for each assessment point or summarized at each week for drinking endpoints. All data will be presented in listings.  
11.4.2. Analysis Addressing the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be a mixed- effect model for repeated measures. 
Treatment group, study week, treatment group by [CONTACT_82522], clinical site and 
baseline percentage of heavy drinking days will be covariates in the mixed effects model. 
Additional covariates may be selected as specified in the SAP . The primary endpoint will be 
performed on available data in the Full Analysis Set with no imputation for missing data. A 
sensitivity analysis will be performed using multiple imputation for missing drinking data  
(Jakobsen -2017). Multiple imputation replaces each missing value with a set of “m” plausible 
values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute. The imputation model will include a limited set of variables likely to be associated with missingness on the primary 
endpoint, excluding treatment assignment. The variables may include but are not limited to site, time and baseline alcohol use. Specification of the variables used in the mult iple imputation 
models will be provided in the SAP. 
11.4.3. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  Analysis  
Analysis of the continuous secondary endpoint s (weekly mean drinks per week , weekly mean 
drinks per drinking day, percentage of days abstinent, number of cigarettes s moked per week, 
number of days of other nicotine product use per week, POMS scores, E CR-RS scores, PROMIS 
scores, and Urge to Drink s cores  will be analyzed  in a similar fashion to that of the primary 
outcome (except substituting baseline equivalent of the outcome). Analysis of the dichotomous 
secondary outcomes (percentage of subjects with no heavy drinking days, percentage subjects 
abstinent from alcohol, percentage of subjects with 1 - and 2- level decrease s in WHO drinking 
categories , and percentage of smo kers abstinent from smoking) will be conducted via logistic

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 72 NIAAA Confidential   regression of the endpoint measured across the entire treatment period  (monthly and with grace 
periods, as specified). Secondary analyses to satisfy statistical hypotheses will be performed on 
data collected during the 10-week  maintenance period; however, as appropriate descriptive 
statistics will be used to present these data during the initial [ADDRESS_743576] recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities ( MedDRA ) and will be grouped by [CONTACT_9313] ( SOC ) and preferred term (PT ) 
designation. The severity, frequency, and relationship of AEs to investigational product will be 
presented by [CONTACT_566122][INVESTIGATOR_14839]. Listings of each individual AE including start date, stop 
date, severity, relationship, outcome, and duration will be provided. Each AE (based on PT ) will 
be counted once only for a given study subject. If the same AE occurred on multiple occasions, the highest severity will be assumed. Thus, study subjects are not counted multiple times in a 
given numerator in the calculation of frequencies for a specific AE. C- SSRS reports of 
suicidality or suicidal ideatio n will be reported as AEs and analyzed as AEs  if the investigator 
determines after an interview with the subject that the responses are consistent with suicidal ideation or attempt.  
Clinical chemistry, urine drug screen results, pregnancy test results, BAC results, and SNAQ 
scores will be reported as summary statistics  for each assessment time point . The percentages of 
subjects in each group with a SNAQ score ≤14 at each visit will be presented. Vital signs will be 
presented as summary statistics and chang e from baseline. The proportions of ECG results 
considered clinically significant will also be provided. In addition, change from baseline (shift tables) will also be presented for clinical chemistry data. The numbers and percentages of subjects who had ur ine tests positive for THC at each time point for all subjects, for subjects who 
were positive at baseline, and who were negative at baseline (representing new use) will be summarized. The numbers and proportion of subjects who reported CIWA- AR scores ≥ 10 at 
any time after the start of dosing will be presented. Buss-Perry Aggression scores , SNAQ scores 
and body weight changes will be presented for each visit and will be compared between groups using repeated measures ANOVA.  The numbers and proportions of subjects mild, moderate, 
severe microsomia or any smell loss ( anosmia) compared with screening assessment using the 
UPSIT  will also be presented.  
11.4.5. Compliance and Retention Analyses  
Medication compliance, defined as the amount of investigational product taken as a proportion of the total amount prescribed per protocol, will be evaluated for the oxytocin  and placebo  groups 
based on the Subject Diary . Average amounts of investigational product taken (volume 
determined from weighing the vials prior to and after dispensing and subtracting the difference) overall and weekly will be reported for the oxyto cin and placebo  groups. The research 
participation rate, defined as percentage of subjects with complete drinking data, will be compared between treatment groups. In addition, the percentage of subjects discontinuing medication or early withdrawal from the  study and a listing of these reasons for discontinuation 
will be provided.

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 73 NIAAA Confidential   11.4.6. Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
Summaries of the characteristics of the subjects in each of the study groups at baseline will be 
prepared. Baseline characteristics will be compared between the oxytocin and placebo  groups 
using appropriate statistical methods.  A summary will be prepared t o show dropouts/retention 
over time in each group, along with the reason for early termination. The number of missing 
observations will be presented between groups. 
11.4.7. Exploratory Analyses 
A number of variables will be tested as potential moderators of the me dication treatment effect 
on the PHDD primary endpoint. Weeks 3-[ADDRESS_743577]. Continuous moderator 
variables will be dichotomized . The potential moderator variables that will be examined include 
measures of anxiety and depression (ECR-RS subscales of attachment and anxiety, POMS 
subscales of depression and anxiety, STAI, and BIS), those suggestive of alcohol withdrawal 
(i.e., withdrawal question on the MINI for alcohol use disorder), and alcohol -related treatment 
goal.  
There is interest in exploring the use of a new Hyperkatifeia Scale as a predictor  and moderator 
of drug response. Exploratory analyses utilizing Hyperkatifeia Scale s cores will include: 
1) conducting moderator analyses using the total score ; and 2) comparison of change from 
baseline between treatment groups for total score and subscales scores . 
11.4.8. Ad Hoc  Analyses 
Ad hoc  analyses may be performed on the Hyperkatifeia Scale as a planned part of exploring the 
utility of this scale including total scores, subscales, and individual items. Ad hoc analyses 
utilizing Hyperkatifeia Scale scores may include: 1) identification of baseline subsets and 
relationship to drinking outcomes; 2) conducting mediator analyses; 3) factor analysis to better 
understand the underlying dimensions of hyperkatifeia; and, 4) validity of the Hyperkatifeia Scale by [CONTACT_566055] (e.g., POMS and PROMIS  scales or subscale scores ). The 
data fr om this study could be used for meta-a nalyses with results of other studies to expand data 
availability for the proposed ad hoc analyses.  
11.4.9. Adjustment for Covariates  
Covariates used in logistic regression and mixed effects models are described in section 11.4.2 
and 11.4.3.

Version 4.0 (5Jul2022) 74 NIAAA Confidential   11.5. Determination of Sample Size 
With an intake sample of 100 subjects (50 subjects per arm) and 12% attrition, it is projected that 
the sample size for primary endpoint analyses will be 88 (44 subjects per arm). The alpha level 
for the primary analyses will be 0.05, two- tailed. An estimate of the effect size (Cohen’s d) for 
the investigational products is 0.60. Equal variances in both groups are assumed. These assumptions lead to a projected power of 0.80.

People sometimes experience uncomfortable feelings or sensations when they don’t drink 
alcohol for some time. These feelings or sensations could happen when waking up after overnight sleep, after a long day at work, or not drinking for several days or weeks.  
 
At baseline:  Take a few minutes to think back to before you decided to enter this study and 
change your drinking. Think about how you felt during the time(s) you couldn’t have a drink. Please read each phrase and circle a number 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 that indicates how intensely you felt these feelings and sensations when you were not drinking alcohol. 
 At end of study:   During this study, think about how you felt during the time(s) you didn’t 
drink. Please read each phrase and circle a number 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 that indicates how intensely you felt these feelings and sensations when you were not drinking alcohol.

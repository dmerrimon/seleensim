Study Title: Combined Behavioral & Analgesic Trial For Fibromyalgia (COMBAT -FM) 
Background and Statement of the Problem  
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic widespread pain syndrome with a number of concurrent symptoms 
(eg, sleep difficulties, fatigue, depression, anxiety), unknown pathogenesis, and no well -replicated 
biological markers, that is estimated to affect [ADDRESS_264578] shown beneficial effects, non e are 
curative. These treatments reduce pain by [CONTACT_3450] 35% but no more than half of patients 
experience clinically meaningful improvements. Similar outcomes have been reported with 
nonpharmacological treatments, particularly Cognitive -Behavior Thera py (CBT), which has been 
shown to produce equivalent benefits to medication in reducing pain and improving function. The 
modest outcome of these monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_220179]. No studies have evaluate d the incremental benefits of combining CBT and 
medication as suggested in the American Pain Society.  
Objectives  
We have adpated CBT especially for FM (CBT fm), giving greater attention to fatigue, sleep, pacing, 
avoidance of activity, and interpersonal com munication. Tramadol (Tram) is a drug that has been 
shown to reduce pain and improve function in many FM patients. The primary outcome is the 
change in pain severity m easured by [CONTACT_144372] [ADDRESS_264579] the hypothesis that 
the combination of CBT fm + Tram will produce significantly greater reduction in pain severity or 
physical function compared to  CBTfm + placebo (Pbo) drug, Health E ducation (HE)  + Tram , and HE 
+ Pbo drug. Specifically, that a greater proportion of patients in the CBT fm +Tram group will 
achieve at least 30% reduction in pain (on 5 -day daily pain diaries) or 20% improvement in function 
(on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire -Revised) compared to the other [ADDRESS_264580] if 
function al improvement is greater in combination of CBT and Tram as compared to other groups . 
Another secondary objective is to incorporate real -time objective data collection of patients’ sleep 
patterns and activity using actigraphic recording (actigraphy) into the assessment, treatment , and 
outcome evaluation of patients. Specifically, we will utilize this objective activity and sleep data to: 
(1) eva luate the extent to which patients demonstrate perceptual dissociation regarding their sleep 
quality and levels of activity; (2) reduce perceptual dissociation by [CONTACT_220213]; and (3) measure changes in sleep quality and 
activity level in response to treatment.  
Even when treatments provide benefits in FM, the mechanisms are largely unknown. Another 
secondary objective  of the project is to examine psychological and physiologic mechanism s that we 
hypothesize mediate symptom improvement that patients demonstrate in response to Tram or 
CBTfm. Specifically, we will examine the hypothesis that reduction in pain from these treatments 
can be accounted for by [CONTACT_220214] (C S) of noxious stimuli and improvement 
in mood. The final secondary objective  of the proposed research is to explore  processes that 
mediate improvements that patients demonstrate in response to treatments provided in the study. 
Specifically we will evaluate  a mediational model of the effects of fatigue on activity level, arising

Study: COMBAT -FM Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_264581] udy: pre -treatment (Visits 1 &  2), mid -treatment (Visit 7-8), at the end 
of treatment (Visit 1 2), and 6 -month s follow -up (Visit 1 4) following treatment. Additionally, self -report 
outcomes will be collected by [CONTACT_2319] 3-months following post -treatment evaluation .  
Interventions and Duration  
Informed consent will be obtained on Visit 1 along with physical and baseline  assessments. At Visit 
2 completion of baseline assessments will occur and actigraph will be dispensed. Actigraph use will 
occur for a 1 -week duration at several points during the study (i.e., between Visits 2 -3, 7-8, 11-12). 
Study medication (either Pbo or Tram) will be provided on Visit 3, and subject will be titrated up 
over a 2 -week period. On visits 4-11, which occur once per week, patients will receive behavioral 
health  treatment intervention (either CBT fm or HE). Foll ow-up visit will occur 1 week following 
completion of treatment (Visit 13). Evaluation of efficacy endpoints will occur at the end of the drug 
maintenance/ behavioral health  treatment phase (Visit 13), at which point subjects will begin drug 
taper. Subjects  will return 1 week following the start of taper (Visit 14) to facilitate taper. Subjects 
will be mailed a follow -up packet of self -report measu res to complete and return at [ADDRESS_264582] -
treatment. Finally, subjects will  return for a follow -up visit 6 -months fo llowing completion (Visit 15). 
(See Appendix A  for complete schedule of activities).  
Population  and Sample Size  
Men or women between the ages of 21-[ADDRESS_264583] 30% or a 20% 
improvement in physical functionig at the end of the treatment when compared to the score just prior 
to treatment. Our primary hypothesis may be supported by a statisticall y significant difference in 
proportion of responders among the 4  groups at the α = .[ADDRESS_264584] of 
difference between pairs of groups . We propose to enroll 81 individuals in each site, for a total of 
162 individuals in the final intent -to-treat sample. The power for this sample size is quite high. For 
example, if we observe a proportion of r esponders of . 2 for HE + Pbo, .4  for HE +Tram, . 4 for 
CBTfm + Pbo, and .6  for CBT fm + Tram, we would have a power of .8 to find the difference 
betwe en groups.   
 
 
 Page 14 of 54 CONFIDENTIAL  
Study: COMBAT -FM Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_264585] the hypothesis that  
the comb ination of a CBT that has been adapted for FM (CBT fm), a behavioral -health treatment 
that has been shown to improve physical functioning and pain , and Tr am, a drug that has been 
shown to reduce pain FM p atients moderately , will produce greater reduction in pain severity (as 
measured by [CONTACT_220215] 5-day daily pain dairy ) or physical function  (FIQR) 
assessed just prior and immediately following treatment) than HE+Tram, CBT fm+Pbo, or HE+Pbo . 
1.2. Seconda ry Objectives . Several secondary objectives are proposed. There is evidence that 
FM p atients have inaccurate perceptions regarding their behaviors, including their physical 
capabilities.1 In this protocol , we use the term “perceptual dissociation” to describe these 
inaccuracies. A nother secon dary objective  of the project is to gather objective data regarding 
patients’ sleep patterns and activity using actigraphy, and to utilize these data into the assessment, 
treatment , and outcome evaluation of p atients, specifically: (1) to evaluate the extent to which 
patients demonstrate perceptual dissociation regarding their perceived and actual sleep quality and 
levels of activity; (2) to reduce perceptual dissociation by [CONTACT_1541] p atients with accurate feedback 
regarding their sleep and activity levels; and (3) to m easure changes in sleep quality and activity 
level in response to t reatment . 
Even when t reatment s provided benefits in FM, the mechanisms are largely unknown. The 3rd 
objective  of the project is to examine psychological and physiologic mechanisms that may underlie 
functional improvement that p atients 
demonstrate in response to treatment . 
Specifically, we will examine the hypothesis 
that improvement in function from these 
treatme nts will be predicted by [CONTACT_220216] (CS) of noxious stimuli 
and improvement in mood . The final 
objective  of the proposed research is to study 
processes that mediate improvements that 
patients demonstrate in response to tr eatment s 
provided in the study. Specifically we will 
evaluate a mediational model of the effects of 
fatigue on activity level, arising from pain level, 
sleep disturbance, and mood disturbance (Figure A). Additionally, we will evaluate the direct effects 
of pain level and mood on activity levels.  
The proposed project extends our research by [CONTACT_220217] t reatment s, examining the dissociation of p atients’ beliefs and actual activity, 
and evaluates an important underlying mechanism that may contribute to our understanding of a 
biological  factor  associated with treatment effects and FM more generally.  
2. BACKGROUND  
2.1. Statement of the Problem . FM is a chronic  pain syndrome with an unknown etiology and  
wide-ranging symptom profile including pain, fatigue, decreased activity, and depressed mood. 
Recently the role of perturbations in the central nervous system and the process of “central 
sensitization” (CS) have  been implicated. Although research has demonstrated that a variety of 
monotherapie s - including CBT and Tram – improve symptoms and functioning in FM, benefits

2.3. Rationale and Supporting Data .  
2.2.1. Comb ination Therapy . Since no curative therap y for FM has been discovered, treatment s  
currently used are pragmatic and aim to maximize symptom relief and restore function. Research 
supports the effectiveness of various  treatment s, including CBT and several medications.2, 3 
However, none of these t reatment s is curative2 and less than 10% of p atients with FM return to 
premorbid levels of functioning following t reatment .[ADDRESS_264587] systematically vari ed treatment  elements, 
and they both provide support for combination t reatment . For example, Buckelew8 provided FM 
patients with either biofeed back/relaxation, exercise, both, or neither. At follow -up, p atients 
receiving combination therapy had the best outcomes. Isomeri et al.[ADDRESS_264588] evaluated the combination of CBT and a particular pharmacologic 
agent.  
The primary hypothesis to be tested in this application is that the combination of CBT fm + Tram will 
lead to greater decrease in pain severity  or improvement i n funtioning  as assessed by [ADDRESS_264589] Qustionnaire -Revised  than CBT or Tr am alone. The factorial design of the 
proposed study also will make it possible to examine the effectiveness of CBT fm and Tr am as 
monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as well the effectiveness of the use in combination, and the possibility of 
interactions between the 2 types of t reatment .   
2.2.2. CBTfm. CBT has demonstrated efficacy in the t reatment  of FM comparable to that provided  
by [CONTACT_6589].14,15 It has been recommended  in recent evidence -based clinical practice 
guidelines .16-18 CBT is a generic term; there are many specific interventions that have been included 
(e.g., exposure, cognitive restructuring, social skills training). We propose to provide customized  
CBT (designated CBT fm) that incorporates several of the above interventions, and  has been 
developed by [CONTACT_220218] p atients with FM, including 
providing techniques to enhance sleep quality , reduce fatigue, increase physical activity , reduce 
fear of activity, and improve interpersonal communications .  
A noteworthy feature of CBT fm is the use of actigraphy to address the dissociation between what 
FM p atients’ perceptions about their physical capacities and the reality of what they are actually 
capable of doing. An actigraph  is a solid state accelerometer designed to measure ambulatory 
activity over extended periods of time in naturalistic settings. Actigraphic recordings have been 
used extensively as an indicator of activity levels while individuals are awake19, as well as a 
behavioral indicator of sleep quality.[ADDRESS_264590] the advantage of being objective 
measures that are not dependent on p atients’ reports of activity or sleep quality. We will utilize 
actigraphic  data during baseline assessments to evaluate the perceptual dissociation among 
perceived and actual sleep an d functional capabilities, and a ctigraphy during the course of

of the study. Finally actigraphic recordings will be used as outcome variables to assess seconda ry 
hypotheses in the study.  
2.2.2. Tramadol (T ram). The efficacy and tolerability of Tr am have been demonstrated in a  
number of pain conditions21 including FM22-[ADDRESS_264591] 
mechanisms, it: (1) binds to mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] r eceptors, and exerts a weak opi[INVESTIGATOR_220180]; (2) inhibits the 
neuronal reuptake of 5 -hydroxytriptamine (serotonin); and (3) inhibits the neuronal reuptake of 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. Pharmacologic studies provide evidence that all [ADDRESS_264592] may also be relevant. Although the effectiveness of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_220181] t reatment  of FM has received little attention in research, Tr am is generic and has 
been approved by [CONTACT_220219] t reatment  of chronic pain so in the proposed study it will be  used  
“on label.” Moreover, FM p atients indicate that these medications are more effective than other 
classes of medication.27   
2.2.3. CBTfm +Tram. Evidence  and clinical practice guidelines5, as well as our own experience 
conducting research on the t reatment  of FM suggest that increasing activity is a key component to 
reduce pain severity and improve functional outcomes. In fact research has demonstrated that one 
of the major benefits of CBT appears to be its impact on increasing activity.28, [ADDRESS_264593] be willing to perform the assig nments. In this setting, Tr am can promote behavior 
change by [CONTACT_220220], and, thereby, giving p atients the confidence to try out 
behaviors avoided. Once they attempt these behaviors and receive real -time feedback about their 
actual progress, a positive (corrective) feedback loop is created in which p atients may master 
successively more challenging tasks.      
2.2.4. Mediators of Clinical Improvement in FM.  Even when t reatment s provided benefits in FM,  
the biologic as well as psychological mechanisms are largely unknown. The 3rd objective  of the 
study is to examine psychological and physiologic al mechanisms  that may underlie functional 
improvement that p atients demonstrate in response to Tr am or CBT fm. Specifically, we will 
examine the hypothesis that improvement in function from these t reatment s will be predicted by 
[CONTACT_220214]  (CS) and improvement in mood .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Central Sensitization (CS) and FM . Although the causal mechanisms of symptoms  
underlying FM are not well understood, research suggests that CS of noxious sensory information 
is an important contributing factor. CS can be manifested by [CONTACT_220221] (i .e., diffu se noxious inhibitory controls - DNIC), and/or by [CONTACT_220222] (ie, 
temporal summation – TS). P atients with FM have been shown to have both impaired DNIC and 
enhanced TS of nociceptive stimuli.30-33 We are not aware of any research demonstrating changes 
in these indices of CS in response to t reatment . However, if, as postulated, CS is a fu ndamental 
process in FM, changes in the clinical status of FM p atients should be associated with changes in 
CS. Because heighte ned sensitivity to noxious stimuli is thought to be a pathologic hallmark of FM, 
we hypothesize that CBT fm, will result in the lo wering of the nociceptive responding, as evidenced 
by [CONTACT_220223]. Specifically, we hypothesize  that: (1) DNIC will increase and TS 
decrease over the course of CBT fm and (2) decrease in pain severity will be associated with

physiological marker provides preliminary support for the feasibility of the latter hypothesis.20 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Depressed Mood and FM. A defining feature of FM is dysphoric mood. Mood bears a  
synergistic relationship with symptoms whereby [CONTACT_220225].34 Long -term 
outcomes of exercise t reatment  are more closely associated with changes in psychological 
variables (e .g., self-efficacy  (SE)35, self-esteem36, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]37, helplessness37, fear of movement37-39, 
emotional distress34, and catastrophizing39) than they are to changes in physical parameters such 
as strength and flexibility.28,[ADDRESS_264594] improvement in function ( Objective 3 ). More specifically we plan to evaluate the 
mediational effects of activity level on function, arising from pain level, sleep disturbance, and mood 
disturbance ( Objective 4 ).  
3. STUDY DESIGN  
In the randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial described in this protocol, 162  
individuals with FM will begin treatment in 1 of 4 treatment groups: (1) CBT fm + Tram; (2) HE  + 
Tram; (3) CBT fm + Pbo; and (4) HE + Pbo. The sample size was calculated for the prima ry aim 
which is measured at post -treatment . Based on previous experience with this population, we expect 
that there will be about 15% attrition at the end of the 3 months follow -up and 1 5% more by [CONTACT_220226] 6 months follow -up.   
The primary hypothes is is that CBT fm+Tram will lead to greater decrease  in pain or improvement in 
physical function than the other 3 combinations of treatments.  Specifically, a signifi cantly greater 
proportion of subjects in the CBT fm+Tram group will demonstrate at least a 30% reduction in pain 
severity based on the 5 -day daily pain diary  or 20% improvement in function on the FIQR .1a-d We 
also hypothesize that a perceptual dissociation exists between real and perceived activity levels 
and sleep quality, and that change in mood and CS of pain will predict improvement in function.  
Systematic assessment of pain severity, physical and emotional functioning, CS, and actigraphy 
over the course of treatment will make it possible to accomplish the primary and secondary 
objectives of the study. Assessments of all primary and secondary outcomes will be conducted at 4 
different in -person visits throug hout the study: pre -treatment (Visit 1 and 2), mid -treatment (Visit 7-
8), immediately following treatment (Visit 13), and 6 months (V isit 14) following treatment. 
Additionally, self -report outcomes will be collected via the ma il at a 3-month follow -up visit . Based 
on experience working with patients with FM in clinica l trials and enrollment projections by [CONTACT_941] 2 
study sites, it is expected that this trial will take 4.0 years to complete enrollment.  
4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF SUBJECTS  
4.1. Inclusion Criteria : 
1. Assess 1990 and 2010 ACR criteria for the diagnosis of FM.41-44 If patients meet the 1990

               trigeminal neuralgia).  
           6. Any cognitive impairment that in the investigator’s judgment would limit the patient’s ability     
               to provide informed consent or participate in the study.  
           7. Taking MAO  inhibitors  * 
           8. Other drug exclusions: amphetemines, ketamine, triptans , fenfluaramine  and         
      metaclopramide due to their possible negative interactions with Tramadol. *

           11. Taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_220183]/or able to taper off for study duration. * 
                  If currently on Tram at time of initial evaluation, participant must be willing to taper off  
                  completely prior to participation in study.  
 *For all drug exclusions - Any medication dosage change or taper will be done under the 
supervision of the subjects primary care physician. Subject’s must be completely off of a medication 
or at the allowed dose for at least 30 days prior to be enrolled into the study. Any change will be 
varified with their PCP.  
4.2. Study Enrollment Procedures . Patients with FM will be recruited by [CONTACT_220227]  (PCPs)  and specialist 
physicians in their communities. The enrollement form (see Appendix B) will be used  as a guide in 
pre-screening potential subjects in person and over the telephone before the provision of informed 
consent at the screening visit. This pre -screening will be conducted in accordance with all HIPAA 
and local IRB regulatory requirements after pro viding verbal HIPAA assurance and obtaining 
subjects’ verbal consent to proceed with the interview. Records will be kept of patients who were 
considered ineligible for participation in the study as well as those who declined participation. All of 
the pre -screening source documentation will be stored with the confidential study records. The pre -
screening source documentation for individuals who are not eligible for the study or who decline 
participation will be stripped of identifiers and stored with the con fidential study records.  
The study procedures and risks will be described to potenti al subjects in person by [CONTACT_220228]. Subjec ts will only be allowed to sign the informed consent form  when project  staff 
are confident that they understand the procedures and risks of the study, have the capacity to

5. Study Interventions  
5.1. Drug Intervention . 
5.1.1. Tramadol . Tramadol  hydrochloride  is a centrally act ing synthetic opi[INVESTIGATOR_11595].  
The chemical name [CONTACT_220278] (±) cis-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl] -1-(3-
methoxyphenyl) cyclohexanol hydrochloride. It is FDA approved for the treatment of moderate to 
moderately severe pain.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacodynamics . Although Tram’s mode of action is not completely understood,  
from animal tests, at least 2 complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and 
M1 metabolite to μ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_220184] -uptake of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_220185].  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_220186] e parent compound and higher affinity binding 
of the O -demethylated metabolite M1 to mu -opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328]. In animal models, M1 is up to [ADDRESS_264599] some 
other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467]. These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic 
profile of Tram. Analgesia in humans begins approximately within one hour after administration and  
reaches a peak in approximately 2 -3 hours.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetics . The analgesic activity of Tram is due to both p arent drug and the  M1 
metabolite. Tram is administered as a racemate and both the [ -] and [+] forms of both Tram  and M1 
are detected in the circulation. Linear pharmacokinetics have been observed following multiple 
doses of 50 and 100 mg to steady -state.  
Absorption  
The mean absolute bioavailability of a 100 mg oral dose is approximately 75%. The mean peak 
plasma c oncentration of racemic Tram and M1 occurs at 2 -3 hours, respectively, after 
administration in healthy adults. In general, both enantiomers of tramadol and M1 follow a parallel 
time course in the body following single and multiple doses although small diff erences ( <10%) exist 
in the absolute amount of each enantiomer present.  
Steady -state plasma concentrations of both Tram and M1 are achieved within [ADDRESS_264600] to food.  
Distribution  
The volume of distribution of Tram was 2.6 and 2.9 liters/kg in male and female subj ects, 
respectively, following a 100 mg intravenous dose. The binding of Tram to human plasma proteins 
is approximately 20% and binding also appears to be independent of concentration up to 10 μg/mL. 
Saturation of plasma protein binding occurs only at conce ntrations outside the clinically relevant 
range.  
Metabolism  
Tram is ext ensively metabolized after oral administration by a number of pathways, including 
 
 
 Page 20 of 54 CONFIDENTIAL  
Study: COMBAT -FM Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 12/16/2014                                               Version 1.0  CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, as well as by [CONTACT_220229]. Approximately 30% of 
the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, whereas 60% of the dose is excreted as 
metabolites. The remainder is excreted either as unidentified or as une xtractable metabolites. The 
major metabolic pathways appear to be N- and O-demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation in 
the liver. One metabolite ( O-desmethyltramadol, denoted M1) is pharmacologically active in animal 
models. Formation of M1 is dependent on CYP2D6 and as such is subject to inhibition, which may 
affect the therapeutic response.   
Approximately 7% of the population has reduced activity of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme of cytochrome 
P-450. These individuals are "poor metabolizers" of debrisoquine, dextromethorphan, tricyclic 
antidepressants, among other drugs. Based on a population PK analysis of Phase I studies in 
healthy subj ects, concentrations  of Tram  were approximately 20% higher in "poor metabolizers" 
versus "extensive metabolizers", while M1 concentrations were 40% lower. Concomitant therapy 
with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine and quinidine could result in significant 
drug interactions. In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that inhibitors 
of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine, amitriptyline and quinidine inhibit the 
metabolism of tramadol to various degrees, suggesti ng that concomitant administration of these 
compounds could result in increases in Tram concentrations and decreased concentrations of M1. 
The full pharmacological impact of these alterations in terms of either efficacy or safety is unknown. 
Concomitant us e of Serotonin  re-uptake Inhibitors and MAO Inhibitors  may enhance the risk of 
adverse events, including seizure and serotonin syndrome.  
Elimination  
Tram is eliminated primarily through metabolism by [CONTACT_220230].  The mean terminal plasma elimination half -lives of racemic Tram and 
racemic M1 are 6.3 ± 1.4 and 7.4 ± 1.4 hours, respectively. The plasma elimination half -life of 
racemic Tram increased from approximately 6-7 hours upon multiple dosing.  
5.1.2. Placebo  (Pbo) . An inert Pbo  will be used in the study. Although side effects from Tram  
could result in unblinding of subjects and/or investigators, the possibility of unblinding from side 
effects will be offset by [CONTACT_220231] P bo that will confer no benefit to 
subjects and possibly cause deleterious side effects (e.g., constipation).  
5.1.3. Rescue Medications . Subjects will be offered acetaminophen as a rescue medication for  
unacceptable pain. They wi ll be permitted to take up to 8 -325 mg  (i.e., 2 tablets  4x/day) of 
acetaminophen per day. They will be told that the rescue medication is acetaminophen, and warned 
not to take any other over -the-counter or prescription medications that contain acetaminophen.  
Any subjects who cannot tolerate pain that has remained intractable to the blinded study medication 
and treatment with acetaminophen will be reminded of their right to exit the trial and be referred to a 
physician with expertise in pain treatment.  
5.1.3 .1. Acetaminophen pharmacodynamics . Acetaminophen is a centrally acting analgesic  
and antipyretic with minimal anti -inflammatory properties. The mechanism of action of 
acetaminophen in reducing pain is unknown but may be due to an inhibition of central prostaglandin 
synthesis (specifically cyclooxygenase (COX) -2) and an elevation of the  pain threshold.  
5.1.3 .2. Acetaminophen pharmacokinetics .  
Absorption  – Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_220187]. Peak plasma concentrations occur in 
0.5-2 hours.  
Distribution  – 25% protein bound; plasma concentrations do not correlate well with an algesic effect, 
but do correlate with toxicity.  
Metabolism  – 90-95% metabolized in the liver.

5.1.4. Medication Treatment Protocol . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medication Titration . Subjects will undergo a [ADDRESS_264601] titration schedule unless they experience unacceptable side effects. Su bjects 
who cannot reach a minimum dose of 4 study pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (i.e., 200 mg) per day will be dropped from the 
study.  
The dose achieved by [CONTACT_220232] [ADDRESS_264602] udy (i.e., between D ays 15 and 71 of the 
study). However, if subjects report unacceptable side effects at some time during this 8 week 
period, they will be permitted to  reduce their intake by 1 capsule /day. If they cannot tolerate 4 
capsules per day (200mg) they will be dropped from the study. Conversely, if the y are taking fewer 
than 8 capsules s/day as of day 14, and later report  inadequate pain relief, they will be allowed to 
increase their intake by 1 capsule /day to the study max imum of 8 capsule s (i.e., 400 mg) daily .  
 
Subjects who are taking doses of serotonergic antidepressant s that are greater than 50% of the 
recommended maximum dose will only titrate up to the lowest effective dose of Tramad ol, 4 
capsules (200mg) per day (Ta ble [IP_ADDRESS] .)

taper of their study drug, as shown in Table 5.5.4. 2.1 and Table [IP_ADDRESS].2 . During the taper phase of 
the protocol (Days 72 to 81), the open -label rescue medication can be used to control pain. To 
prevent the possibility of the subject developi[INVESTIGATOR_220188], this taper medication 
protocol must be followed whenever subjects discontinue participation in the protocol at any time for 
any reason. If subjects are not taking the maximum dosage of the blinded study medication at the 
point they begin the taper schedule, they are to begin their taper at whatever point in the schedule 
corresponds to their current dosage of study medication; the taper schedule will therefore not 
always be [ADDRESS_264603] ic opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801] (e.g., diarrhea, 
diaphoresis, insomnia, agitation, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2657], rhinorrhea) during the [ADDRESS_264604] ’s 
responses during the treatment phase of the study, and du ring the taper phase. Subjec ts who have 
experienced significant symptom relief  during the treatment phase will be advised that although the 
study clinician remains blinded to the study medication, the participant might benefit from a trial o f 
Tram supervised by [CONTACT_5657]/her primary care provider .

5.1.5. Medication Distribution, Storage, and Accountability . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Packaging. Study drug [50 mg tramadol IR tablets] will be purchased from the  
manufacturer . To maintain the blind study drug will be over encapsulated and Pbo to Match (PTM) 
capsules will be manufactured and packaged into its primary container closure system by [CONTACT_220233] (UIP).  A total of 100 capsules of 50mg active Tram IR or PTM 
(0mg Tram IR) will be packaged in each bottle by [CONTACT_220234].  
UIP will then create identically matching [ADDRESS_264605] of randomization codes and attendant study drug ass ignment and behavioral health treatment 
assignment from the study Biostatistician at the University of Washington (M. Ciol, PhD).  The 
behavioral treatment assignment (CBT fm or HE) will be on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_182586], within the sealed drug kit , 
so that research staff are blind to next assignment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Labeling. At a minimum the following information will be included on each thirteen (13) 
week kit box and each bottle:  
• Name [CONTACT_790]  
• Name [CONTACT_220279]  
• Study number/Acronym  
• Drug treatment ( Generically listed as either t ramadol or placebo capsule)  
• Behavioral Health Treatment (Behavioral Health 1, or Behavioral Health 2)  
• Pharmaceutical dosage form  
• Route of administration  
• Quantity of dosage unit  
• Directions for use  
• Storage conditions  
• Space for information to be completed by [CONTACT_10670]/designee:  
o Name [CONTACT_220280]  
o Dispensing date  
o Subject number  
• Statement “Caution: New Drug – Limited by [CONTACT_192321]”

[IP_ADDRESS]. Storage. All drug supplies should be stored at controlled room temperature, 15 -30C (59-
86F). The study drug must also be stored in a secure location with limited access.  At the University 
of Washington, the study drug will be stored at the Investigational Drug Services Pharmacy at the 
University of Washington Medical Center. Designated study personnel wil l pi[INVESTIGATOR_220189].  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Accountability of Study Drug Supplies. Study drug will be shipped from UIP in batches 
of [ADDRESS_264606] maintain accurate records (including da tes) of all supplies received. All study drug supplies 
issued to, used by, and returned by [CONTACT_220235] a Drug Log (see Appendix  J) 
completed by [CONTACT_24342], Study Coordinator, or Pharmacist. Current dispensing records will be 
maintained, including the date and amount of medication delivered  per subject.  Subjects will receive 
sufficient study medication to use until their next scheduled visit. A detailed dispensing schedule will 
be given to subjects with their study medication. The sites will log in kit numbers on the dispensing 
log in the subjects’ elect ronic case report forms (eCRFs). Subjects will be instructed to return all 
unused medications. All unused and returned study medication not required by [CONTACT_220236].  
5.1.6. Blinding and Unblinding of Study Medication. Subjects will be unblinded to their study  
medication if required for their safety o r if the subject needs emergency surgery and information 
about all treatment interventions is requested; this is expected to occur very rarely , if ever. Only in 
the event of an emergency that the investigator feels cannot be adequately treated without know ing 
the identity of the study medication can the medication blind be broken for a particular subject. 
Individual  drug assignment will be included  in a sealed document  within each drug kit . In the event 
an emergency situation arises that would require possi ble disclosure of the study as signment, study 
physician will  be paged, and then if decided to release this information, study staff will break this 
seal to identify patient assignment. In the event that an emergency disclosure of treatment 
assignment is required, a call from study staff will be made to inform the the PD, of such disclosure, 
and appropriate protocol deviation form completed and faxed . All remaining sealed and unsealed 
code envelopes/labels must be returned to the University of Washington Biostatisti cian, [CONTACT_220281], at 
the conclusion of the study.  
5.2. Behavioral Intervention . 
Both CBT and HE treatment sessions should be scheduled at weekly intervals at identified times +/ - 
[ADDRESS_264607] to do a 
phone session to review content material necessary for that timeframe.  
5.2.1. CBTfm. CBT has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of FM comparable to  that provided 
by [CONTACT_6589].14,15 It has been recommended  in recent evidence -based clinical practice 
guidelines .16-18 CBT is a generic term; there are many specific interventions that have been included 
(e.g., exposure, cognit ive restructuring, social ski lls training). We propose to provide customized  
CBT (designated CBT fm) that incorporates several of the above interventions, and has been 
developed by [CONTACT_220237], including 
providing techniques to enhance sleep quality , reduce fear of acivity, increase physical activity , and 
improve interpersonal communication  (see Table 5.2.1. ).

Version Date: 12/16/2014                                               Version 1.0  A noteworthy feature of CBT fm is the use of actigraphy to address the dissociation betw een what 
FM p atients’ perceptions about their physical capacities and the reality of what they are actually 
capable of doing. We will utilize  actigraphic  data during baseline assessments to evaluate the 
perceptual dissociation among perceived and actual sleep an d functional capabilities, and 
actigraphy during the course of treatment to provide pat ients with accurate information about their 
activity levels during the course of the stud y.  
CBTfm is adapted from our previous NIH funded projects (AR47298, AR [ZIP_CODE]) that were originally 
based on the treatment described by [CONTACT_220238]45 and used in Turk e t al46 and Swanson et al .47 The 
program has 3 primary modules that will be integrated in the 8 CBT fm sessions: general CBT, 
Physical Activity related to FM, and Sleep Management (Table 5.2.1. ). The general CBT module will 
focus on maladaptive thought processes and behaviors specifically related to pain, mood, sleep, 
fatigue, and activity. All of the sessions  will be designed to help subjec ts understand that this is no 
cure and thus they have to view thems elves as important  in their own rehabilit ation. Sessions will 
emphasize copi[INVESTIGATOR_220190], and fostering SE through informatio n, 
practice, and mastery. Subjec ts will be given information , taught a set of skills that they can use on 
their own, and will be encour aged to practice these at home  (See Appendix VIII  for details).   
The Physical Activity Mod ule will include teaching subjec ts behavioral strategies for increasing 
physical activity that have been developed by [CONTACT_220239].48 Subjec ts will 
address perceptual dissociations by [CONTACT_220240]. They will be given assignments designed to help them monitor their 
physical acti vity and gradually increase it ( See Appendix VIII for details ). 
The Sleep Management Module will focus on pr oblems that subjec ts report regarding their sleep, 
and on perceptual dissociations that they may have regarding the quali ty and quantity of their sleep 
(See Appendix VIII for details ).

6.2. Description of all procedures, evaluations , and outcome measures .  
Patient Self-reported Outcome M easures  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Demographic variables and medical history.  Basic demographic data —date of birth, 
sex, ethnicity, race, marital status, living arrangements, and years of education —will be asse ssed 
during the baseline visit in an elec tronic CRF. The subject’s will complete a medical history, 
including information regarding past and current medical disorders, treatments, and medications as 
well as past and current painful conditions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Self-report outcome measurse. 5-day daily pain diary.  As recommended in recent 
guidelines for assessing treatment outcomes in chronic pain clinical trials52,53, pain will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_220249] o n an 11 -point rating scale ranging from 0 (“No pain”) 
to 10 (“Pain as bad as you can imagine”). Such pain intensity ratings have been extensively used 
as primary outcomes in the assessment of a wide variety of acute and chronic pain syndromes. 
Subjects wil l also be asked to rate their slee p quality and fatigue in this 5 -day daily pain diary  (see 
Appendix D). Subjects will be asked t o complete a [ADDRESS_264623] Questionnaire – Revised (FIQR) will be used to assess pain quality, physical  
and emotional functioning.  
Short -form McGill Pain Questionnaire -2 (SF -MPQ -2)54 is a revised version of the Short -form McGill 
Pain Questionnaire55 that includes the original descriptors assessing sensory and affective 
dimensions of pain supplemented by [CONTACT_220250]. The reliability and validity are

Version Date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_264624] recently been completed.54 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS)56 will be used to assess the extent to which pain 
interferes with emotional functioning.  
Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue ( MAF )57 will be used to assess self -reported fatigue. This 
scale measures five different elements of fatigue; degree, severity, distress, impact on activities of 
daily living, and timing of the fatigue over the past week.  
PTSD Checklist (PCL) will be used to measure the 17 DSMV -IV-TR symptoms of PTSD.  
Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) will be used to assess catastrophic thinking relating to pain.  
The FIQR , SF-MPQ -2, HADS , MAF , PCL and PCS will be administered at baseline ( Visit 2), mid -
treatment ( Visit 8), post -treatment ( Visit 12), 3 months after treatment (electronically), and at the 6 -
month follow -up (Visit 14).  
Life Events Checklist (LEC) will be used at Visit [ADDRESS_264625] affected the 
participant’s life in the past year.  
Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) will be used at visits [ADDRESS_264626]-treatment evaluation of treatment.  
Patient Global I mpression of C hange (PGIC ).58 Subjects will provide a global rating of their 
improvement by [CONTACT_220251] a 7 -point scale: “Since the start of 
treatment (last rating), how much would you rate your overall improvement?”    
Evaluation of the double -blind . To evaluate the integrity of the double -blind, at the final visit all 
subjects and their physicians will be asked whether they believe the subject was assigned to Tram  
or to Pbo, CBT fm or HE  and to indicate the basis of this judgement.  
Treatment Credibili ty Ratings.  Subjects will rate how believable (credible) they perceive the 
treatment they receive to be on a set of 4 items, 9-point Likert -type scale developed by [CONTACT_220252]  (see Appendix E).59 These ratings will be made both at pre-treatment ( Visit 2)  and at the 
end of the final treatment session  (Visit 11) . This method has been shown to have good internal 
consistency (  .91) and was used in  a previous project (AR44724).  
6.2.2. Clinic ian Assessments and Evaluations . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinician exam of eligibility .  
Diagnosis. The diagnosis of FM will be made clini cally on the basis of the subjec t's      
history, tender point exam, and symptom severity ratings  by [CONTACT_220253] 199044 classificati on criteria and the ACR 2010 provisional  diagnostics procedures44 FM will be 
defined as meeting the 1990 (widespread pain of at least [ADDRESS_264627] 11/18

targeted physical examination will be conducted, with particular attention pa id to symptoms and 
signs relevant to this protocol.   
Physical examination.  Physician will also assess participants’ physical capacity using [ADDRESS_264630]  
(see App endix F).  
6.3. Titration visits . Subjects will undergo a [ADDRESS_264631] according t o the schedule given in Table [IP_ADDRESS] . They will be instructed to follow 
this upward titration schedule unless they experie nce unacceptable side effects. Subjects who 
cannot reach a dose of [ADDRESS_264632] by [CONTACT_2006] 14 of the titration phase will be the dose given to them 
during the 8 -week  treatment p hase of the study (i.e., between D ays 15 and 71 of the study ).  
However, if subjects report unacceptable side eff ects at some time during this 8 -week period, they 
will be permitted to reduce  their intake by 1 tablet/day. Conversely, if they are taking fewe r than 8 
tablets/day as of day 14, and later report  of inadequate pain relief, they will be allowed to increase 
their intake by 1 tablet/day.   
6.4. Clinician post -treatment evaluation . Clinician Global Impression of Improvement  
in Treatment . Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) for each subject ( 7-point scale similar to 
what patient  will complete).  
Evaluation of the double -blind.  To evaluate the integrity of the double -blind, at the final visit 
physicians  and nurse practitioners  will be asked whether they believe the subject was assigned to 
Tram  or to Pbo, CBT fm or HE  and to indicate the basis of this judgement.  
6.5. Psychologist Assessments and Evaluations . 
6.5.1. Eligibility Evaluation .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_220200] . The psycholo gists and health educators will complete ratings of  
subjects’ mood, pain behaviors, comprehension, participation, proficiency of copi[INVESTIGATOR_220201], and 
receptivity following each session  (see Appendix H ). These will be combined to create session -by-
session  progress ratings. This procedure was originally  used in Turk et al .[ADDRESS_264633] (AR44724). The process measures will be used as independent variables to predict 
treatment response . 
6.6. Actigraphy . After the screening evaluation an d provision of consent, subjects  will wear an 
actigraph (Actiwatch, Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770], Bend OR) on their wrists for 5 days in order to provide 2 
types of data: (1) objective sleep data and (2) a global index of physical activity level during waking 
hours. They will wear the watch also at mid-point of treatment (between V isit 7-8), upon co mpletion 
of treatment (between V isit 11-12), and for [ADDRESS_264634]  is awake.  A global index of physical  
activity level during waking hours will be derived from the actigraphic data summed over waking 
hours.

progress).  
6.7. Central Sensitization . 
6.7.1. Central Sensitization (CS) and FM . Although the causal mechanisms of symptoms 
underlying FM are not well understood, research suggests that CS of noxious sensory information 
is an important contributing factor. CS can be manifested by [CONTACT_220221] (i.e., diffus e noxious inhibitory controls - DNIC), and/or by [CONTACT_220222] (i.e., 
temporal summation – TS). Patients with FM have been shown to have both impaired DNIC and 
enhanced TS of nociceptive stimuli.30-33  If, as postulated, CS is a fundamental process in FM, 
changes in the clinical status of FM patient s should be associated with changes in CS. Because 
heighted sensitivity to noxious stimuli is thought to be a pathologic hallmark of FM, we hypothesize 
that CBT fm, will result in the lowering of the nociceptive responding, as evidenced by [CONTACT_220254]. Specifically, we hypothesize  that (1) DNIC will increase and TS decrease over the 
course of CBT fm and (2) decrease in pain severity will be associated with decreased CS, as 
measured by [CONTACT_220224]. A recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_220182] a diffe rent physiological marker 
provides preliminary support for the feasibility of the latter hypothesis. 20 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of CS. Potential subjects  who are found to be eligible for the study will 
undergo CS assessments.  The protocol described is currently being used in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_220202] .66 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Temporal Summation To assess temporal  summation (TS), an indicator of the ascending 
excitatory mechanisms of pain processing, we will follow methods described by [CONTACT_220255]67. 
Briefly, we will administer sequences of brief, repetitive mechanical stimuli using a 6.[ADDRESS_264636] rating in each 10 -pulse sequence.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Descending Noxious Inhibitory Controls (DNIC)  assesses the degree to which exposure 
to an ongoing painful “conditioning” stimulus inhibits the pain caus ed by a brief, repeated painful 
“test” stimulus. DNIC assessment will be conducted following a published procedure (Appendix I).[ADDRESS_264637] stimulation (conditioning stimulus), and then a second test stimulation  
concurrently with the conditioning stimulus. Patient s will be asked to avoid any medications (eg, 
acetaminophen) for at least [ADDRESS_264638] heat 
pain produced by [CONTACT_220256] -II stimulator. For conditioni ng stimulus, we will use a 46.5°C hot water 
bath.  
Training phase : Subjec ts will be exposed to 2 short heat stimuli (43o & 44°C), applied to their 
dominant forearm  using a heat probe, each lasting 7sec from the time the stimulus intensity 
reache s the target temperature. Subjec ts will be asked to rate the level of pain on a scale from 0 to 
10. 
 
 
 Page 38 of 54 CONFIDENTIAL  
Study: COMBAT -FM Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_264639] stimulus intensity ( pain-60): After completing the training  phase, the RA/RC  
will determine the “ pain-60” value for each patient (ie, the tem perature rated by [CONTACT_70579] t as a 6 
on a 0 -10 point scale). To determine pain-[ADDRESS_264640] of 43, 44, and 45o C stimulations with a 1 -min 
interstimulus inter val. After each stimulus, subjec ts will be asked to rate the level of pain on a 0 -10 
numerical rating scale. If one of these stimuli is rated as 6, th at temperature will be chosen as the 
stimulus for the TS assessment; if not, additional steps for determining pain-6 will be applied. If the 
pain rating is > 6, additional stimuli of [ADDRESS_264641] stimulus : The thermode will be strapped in place on the forearm and the test 
stimulus will be applied for 30s at the pain-[ADDRESS_264642] stimulus period, subjec ts will 
rate the level of pain intensity 4 times: at 0, 10, 20, and 30s after the onset of the pain-6 
temperature. The mean score of the 4 pain ratings will be calculated.   
Conditioning stimulus : Five minutes after delivering the first test stimulus, subjec ts will be asked to 
place their non -dominant hand in the hot water bath in a still position with their fingers wide apart for 
60s. Patients will be asked to rate the level of pain intensity 4 times: at 0, 10, 20, and 30s after 
immersion of the hand into the water.  
The mean score of the 4 pain ratings will be calculated as the conditioning pain score. Subsequent 
to the 4th pain rating for the conditioning stimulus (after 30s of the hand being immersed in the hot 
water), Patients will be asked to shift their focus to t he contact [CONTACT_220257] 30s at the pain-[ADDRESS_264643] heat pain 
intensity 4 times: at 0, 40, 50, and 60s after immersion of their hand in the hot water bath, while 
their n on-dominant hand remains in the hot water bath. The mean score of the 4 pain ratings will be 
calculated.   
DNIC will be calculated as follows : The mean of the [ADDRESS_264644] stimulus administration (at the end of the conditioning stimulus condition). Negative 
scores indicate pain inhibition, p ositive scores pain facilitation and s cores of 0, for example, would 
indicate no DNI C (no pain inhibition).  
TS and DNIC will be assessed prior to initiation of treatment, following treatment session 5, and 
post-treatment.  
6.8. Research Staff Procedures . 
6.8.1. Recruitment . Records will be kept of all contacts that occur between potential  
subjects and the sites, including eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and reasons for 
non-participation. All HIPAA, IRB, and local regulations regarding the recording and retention of 
these records will be followed.  
6.8.2. Prescreening . During this telephone contact, the RA wi ll explain study requirements. All 
potential subjects who contact [CONTACT_220258] (1) meet  minimal inclusion and exclusion critieria and (2) are willing to commit to the 
requirements of the study (e .g., obtain consent of a healthcare provider, attend regular sesssion, 
taper any medication currently taking). During this telephone contact, the RA  will provide an 
overview of the study and will explain  study participant requirements  (See Appendix  C).    
6.8.3. Medication Log and Pharmacological Adherence . At all visits following the  
baseline visit, all returned medication will be recorded in a medication log  (see Appendix J) for each  
subject. Pharmacological adherence wil be assessed through these weekly pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685]. All use of 
 
 
 Page 39 of 54 CONFIDENTIAL  
Study: COMBAT -FM Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_264645] on FM pain will be 
evaluated during all of the  in-person and telephone interviews (and from the daily diaries during the 
first month) and recorded in logs provided for that purpose. These data will make it possible to 
examine the relationship between analgesic equivalence levelse.g.,69 and pain. Adverse events will 
be evaluated during all of the in -person and telephone inter views (and from the daily diaries during 
the first month) and recorded in logs provided for that purpose (see section 10.3). At all of the 
follow -up visits and telephone contacts throughout the trial, any new medical conditions and 
treatments will be docum ented  (see Appendix K ). Particular attention will be paid to documenting 
any office visits, procedures, inpatient admissions, treatments, and  any other use of health care 
resources associated with the subject’s FM since the previous visit or telephone cont act.  
7. Compensation . Subjects will be compensated $ 25 for completion of e ach of the 2 pre- 
treatment , an additional $100.00 for the completion of treatment, and $150 for return at  the 6-
month follow -up asssessment  (Total possible = $300.00) . They will not be reimbursed for any travel 
expenses that they incur for scheduled or unscheduled visits.   
8. ADVERSE EVENTS  ASSOCIATED WITH STUDY MEDICATIONS  
The most common adverse effects  and side effects associated with the medications being 
administered in this protocol are listed below. Common side effects associated with the medications 
being administered in this study w ill be managed, when necessary, by [CONTACT_220259] 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]/day. If  subjects report  unacceptable side effects  that they attribute to the 
rescue medica tion (acetami nophen), they will work with the study clinician to modify the  dose of  
their acetaminophen. Dose reductions of 1,  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 tablets/day might be institute d, and 
if unacceptable side effects continue, permitting reduction of blinded study medication and rescue 
medication as described above . 
Tramadol  (Tram) : light-headedness, dizziness, tiredness, constipation, excessively high spi[INVESTIGATOR_2120], 
irritability, nausea, vomiting, sweating, redness of face, decreased ability to cough, slowed 
breathing, itching, physical tolerance and dependence if taken for sustai ned periods of time.  
There is some indication that Tramadol may also be associated with a new onet or worsening of 
Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), a disorder in which there is an urge or need to move the legs to 
stop unpleasant sensations.  
Acetaminophen : headache, liver damage and failure, jaundice, skin rash, shortness of breath, chest 
pain, problems with blood.  
9. CRITERIA FOR INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
The participation of subjects in this study may be terminated by [CONTACT_220260] 
[INVESTIGATOR_220203]’s consent for the following reasons: if it appears to be medically harmful to the 
subject, if the subject fails to follow directions for participating in the study, if it is discovered that the 
subject does not meet study requirements, or if  the study is ended.  
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1. General Design Issues and Outcomes . The study biostatistician ( [CONTACT_220282]) will be  
responsible for creating an analysis data set and making any data transformations that are 
necessary, as well as for conducting all statistical analyses and reviewing the results of the 
analyses with the P D, PIs, and the investigators.  The biostatistician will also be responsible for 
preparing drafts of the results of the analyses for conference presentations and man uscript 
preparation.  
10.1.1. Primary outcome measure.  The primary outcome will be  mean pain severity d erived from 
5-day daily diaries  (see Appendix D) and and physical functioning derived from the Fibromyalgia 
Impact Questionnaire -Revised (FIQR) .70 
 
 
 Page 40 of 54 CONFIDENTIAL  
Study: COMBAT -FM Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 12/16/2014                                               Version 1.0  10.1.2. Secondary outcome measures. The secondary and exploratory outcome measures 
include : The Short -form McGill Pain Questionnaire -II (SF-MPQ -2)54 total and subscale scores , 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS56), Multidimensional Assessment  of Fatigue (MAF), 
PTSD Checklist (PCL), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) , Patient Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS),  the Patient Global Index of Change (PGIC) , and the 
Clinician Global Index fo Change (CGIC) . In addition, adverse events  (AEs) , serious adverse events 
(SAEs), study withdrawals, and medicat ion compliance will be examined to evaluate  the tolerability 
and safety of treatment of FM subjects  with Tram . 
10.2. Sample Size . In this clinical trial, 162 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive on e of 4  
treatments: CBT fm + Tram , HE +Tram, CBTfm +Pbo , HE + Pbo  (50/group). This sample size 
should be sufficient for detecting a clinica lly meaningful effect of CBTfm +Tram , allowing for a 
maximum 15% discontinuatiton r ate. The primary outcome variab le will be a reduction of at least 
30% on the pain score  (5-day daily pain diary)  or 20% improvement in physical function (FIQR) 
from baseline (pre -treatment) to post -treatment. Subjects  who achieve such decrease in pain  or 
improvement in function  will be labeled  “responders.”  A similar approa ch to using a composite 
outcome criterion was used in recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_220204].1a-d Our primary hypothesis may be supported by a statistically 
significant difference in proportion of responders among the 4  groups at the α = .[ADDRESS_264646] of difference between pairs of groups. We propose to 
enroll 81 individuals in each site, for a total of 162 individuals in the final intent -to-treat sample. The 
power for this sample size is quite high. For example, if we observe a proportion of r esponders of . 2 
for HE + Pbo, .4  for HE +Tram, . 4 for CBT fm + Pbo, and .6  for CBT fm + Tram, we would have a 
power of .8  to find the difference betwee n groups.  
10.3. Data Analyses.  
10.3.1.  Premature termination.  In order to assure that the patients who did not complete the  
protocol (“tx -N”) are not different from those who completed (“tx -C”), the tx -Ns will be 
compared with the tx -Cs on demographics, medical history, and symptoms , and assignment 
group . A similar  strategy will be used to compare those who refuse to participate following the 
initial evaluation. The assessment of treatment efficacy will be performed using the intention -
to-treat method. Intention -to-treat is a method of data analysis in which the pri mary tabulations 
and companion summaries of outcome data are by [CONTACT_220261], regardless of 
treatment completion  or cross -over to a different treatment . This approach safeguards against 
making an erroneous claim of efficacy because of biases resultin g from exclusion of those who 
fail to complete treatment  as prescribed . 
10.3.2.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_220205].  Since [ADDRESS_264647] effects, several steps will be taken: (1) use of detailed 
treatment protocol, (2) review of audiotaped therapy sessions that are randomly selected by [CONTACT_978] s 
for review , and (3) weekly meetings between t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_220206].  
10.3.3.  Analytical Software. Data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS (Statistical Software  
Package for Social Sciences) for Windows or Mac (version 18 or higher), and SAS version 9.1.3. or 
higher.  
10.3.4.  Analytical Approach  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assumptions for Statistical Procedures.  Prior to conducting any statistical 
analyses to test hypotheses, exploratory analyses will be performed as needed in order to 
check the underlying assumptions for each statistical procedu re (e.g., normal curve plots, 
testing for the homogeneity of variance).

The primary outcome will be a reduction of at least 30% on the pain score  (mean for 5 -day daily 
pain diary)  or improvement of 20%  physical function  (FIQR) from baseline (pre -treatment) to post -
treatment.  Individuals who achieve such decrease in pain will be labeled  “responders.”    
Hypothesis 1 A: The group of  FM patients receiving combination therapy (CBT fm+Tram) will have a 
larger proportion of responders as compared to the other 3 treatment groups .  
Hypothesis 1B: The differences in proportion of responders will be maintained at the [ADDRESS_264648] of homogeneity among the 4 treatment 
groups, using the classification “responder” or “n on-responder” for each person. The test will 
use a signifcance level of 0.05. If the test is not statistically significant, we will conclude that 
the [ADDRESS_264649] -6 months outcomes 
(responder versus non -responder ). 
3. Individuals will be analyzed in the group assigned to them through randomization regardless 
of their adherence to the treatment (intent -to-treat approach). Missing values for outcome 
variables will be treated as described below in 10.3.6.  
Hypotheses 2 -5 are secondary hypothesis and will be interpreted as exploratory.   
Hypothesis 2: Decrease in CS, as assessed via TS and DNIC, and decrease in affective distress 
will predict improvement in function.  
We will conduct a sequential regression analysis, with percent change in FIQR as the dependent 
variable, and baseline pain severity entered in Step 1, and TS, DNIC, and HADS scores entered in 
step 2. Hypothesis 2 will be supported by a statistically signif icant beta weight for TS, DNIC, and 
HADS.  
Objective #3: Test of the Perceptual Dissociation between perceived and actual sleep quality and 
activity . 
Hypothesis 3: Modest to weak relationships among objective measures of sleep and activity and 
self-report measures of sleep and functioning.  
Correlations will be < 0.30 among objective measures of sleep and activity and self -report 
measures of sleep and functioning.  
1. Bivariate correlations among self -report and objective measures of sleep and activity 
will be evaluated.  
2. Multiple regression analyses will be conducted to investigate the relative importance 
of perceived and actual sleep quality, as predictors of activity levels.  
Objective #4:  
Test mediational model of activity.  
Hypothesis 4-5:  
4. Pain and Mood will predict increase in activity (as assessed via actigra phy).

Version Date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_264650] of fatigue level on physical function (FIQR), 
driven by [CONTACT_220262], sleep quality, and mood.  
Path analysis will be conducted to test the model presented in Figure D6.5 for all pat ients at 
baseline (implemented using PROC 
CALIS in SAS version 9.1.3) . 
Specifically, the model posits a 
meditational effect of fatigue on 
activity level, arising from pain level, 
sleep disturbance, and mood 
disturbance. Additionally, direct effects 
are ind icated for pain level and mood 
on activity levels. Two main analyses 
will be included as part of the path 
analysis.  
First, the proposed model will be 
tested for adequate fit, given the data, 
and will be described in terms of the 
Comparative Fit Index (CFI). The CFI 
ranges from 0 (poor fit) to 1 (perfect fit), and is a widely -accepted fit index used in structural 
equation modeling approaches to data analysis.[ADDRESS_264651] on activity level 72, and the model will be subsequently modified and re -
tested for adequacy of fit.   
10.3.5.  Adverse  Events .  The number and percentage of patients in each group who experience a  
treatment -emergent adverse events (AEs)  will be summa rized. Associated adverse events  will also 
be summarized, and include those events the investigators consider to be possibly, probabl y, or 
definitely related to treatment, and those for whi ch the relationship is unknown (See Appendix M). 
10.3.6.  Treatment of missing data. Every effort will be made to retain subjects in this study  and to 
collect all data at every visit. If a subject cannot tolerate or refuses to continue taking study 
medication, follow up and evaluation will continue if the subject is willing. If a subject drops out, 
attempts will be made to bring the subject in fo r a final evaluation. Adherence with trial procedures, 
dropouts/dropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], and reasons for subject withdrawal will be carefully tracked throughout the study.  
If a subject is missing a response at a particular visit, missing data will be imputed using a multi ple 
imputation algorithm based on linear or logistic regression  (depe nding on the whether the outcome 
is a nume ric or binary variable) . For subjects with complete data up to a particular visit, a regression 
model will be fit that includes the outcome at that visit as the response variable and outcomes at 
previous visits, treatment group, center, age, sex, pain intensity, as explanatory variables. Separate 
models will be similarly constructed for each visit. Using these regression models, a missing value 
for a subject at a particular visit will be imputed as a draw from the predictive distribution given the 
outcomes at previous visits (som e possibly imputed), treatment group, center, age, sex, acute pain 
intensity. This will be done sequentially starting with the Day 4 visit. This process will be repeated 
10 times, resulting in 10 complete analysis data sets. The analyses will be performed separately for 
each of the 10 complete analysis data sets, and the results will be combined into one multiple 
imputation inference (estimated treatment effect and associated confidence interval and p -value). 
This strategy is appropriate for data sets that have a monotone missing pattern. If the data set does 
not precisely have this pattern, the monotone data augmentation method using Markov -Chain

Version Date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_264652] available observation, which often yields unrealistic imputed values.  Also, the use of multiple 
imputation avoids the problem of artificially increasing power through data imputation associated 
with single -imputation methods because it accounts for the uncertainty associated with the 
imputation. It is hoped that the overall  conclusions regarding the effects of the interventions will not 
depend greatly on the analysis or imputation strategy used, particularly if the occurrence of missing 
data is minimized.   
10.4. Data Monitoring . A data and safety monitoring boar d (DSMB)  established by [CONTACT_220263]  (KAI 
contract) . Informa tion on all AEs, SAEs, recruitment and retention, data completeness, and data 
quality will be available for review by [CONTACT_4318]. It is not anticipated that there will be any major 
safety concerns with the m edications administered in this trial, all of which are FDA approved and 
have well -characterized safety and tolerability profiles. Tram has been studied in FM, there is no 
reason to believe that its safety and tolerability will be a significant problem.  Interim analyses of all 
AEs and SAEs will be performed periodically throughout the trial for the DSMB. The safety of 
subjects will be a primary concern of the DSMB  and project team , and AEs and particularly SAEs 
will need to be carefully considered by [CONTACT_111710]. If anything appears problematic in the combined 
data or at the specific request of the DSMB, we will provide analyses of AEs and SAEs broken 
down by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_264653] accrual over time. If 
the NI AMS , in consultation with the DSMB, determines that the accrual rate falls substantially below 
that which is necessary for timely completion of the trial, the trial may be halted for futility. The trial 
may also be halted for futility if other indicators of trial performance (e.g., subject retention, data 
quality) suggest that this is appropriate.   
11. DATA COLLECTION, SITE MONITORING, AND ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING  
11.1. Data Collection and Retention . The investigators and staff at the study sites, the P D, PIs,  
Project Reseach Coordinator, and all personnel involved in subject assessment, monitoring, 
analysis, and data management will be blinded to the subject assignment. In order to ensure that 
information that could potentially bias handling of data is not disclosed, the following precautions 
will be practiced: randomization code envelopes will be maintained in fire -proof safes; no access to 
these codes will be permitted to those involved in subject data handling; maintenance of the code 
sealed envelopes by [CONTACT_9916] a locked cabinet at each study site will be carefully 
monitored; and medications will be packa ged in a way that maintains the double blind.  
Study d ata will be  collected and managed  in the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tool 
hosted at the University of Washington.73 REDCap is a secure, web -based application designed to 
support data capture for research studies, providing: (1) an intuitive interface for validated data 
entry; (2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; (3) automated export 
procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and (4) procedures for 
importing data from external sources.  REDCap allows users to build and manage online surveys 
and databases quickly and securely. User right s may be customized, and access to specific data 
fields restricted. A separate contact [CONTACT_220264], addre ss, phone numbers, and study id for the purpose of contact[CONTACT_220265].  This worksheet will be password protected, and access will be limited

worksheet, and access to each field limited to only study staff that will be utilizing that specific field 
(e.g. treating psychologists will only have access to treatment progress notes fields). UR and UW  
data will be collected within the same project, however all rights to data access to each individual 
site will be limited to only staff within each site.   
11.2. Site Monitoring . 
11.3. Adverse Experience Reporting  (See Appendix M for reporting forms).  
11.3.1. Definition  of an adverse event. An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a subject that occurs during the conduct of a clinical study of a pharmaceutical 
product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study medication. This ca n, 
therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, laboratory parameter, or 
disease entity that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study, whether or not 
considered related to the study medication.  
Accordingly, an adverse event could include any of the following:  
• Inter-current illnesses  
• physical injuries  
• events possibly related to concomitant medications  
• significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other preexisting conditions  
• events occurring during diagnostic procedures  
• a laboratory or diagnostic test abnormality occurring after the start of the study (once 
confirmed by [CONTACT_15013]) that results in the withdrawal of the subject from the study, 
require s medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, or is considered by [CONTACT_220267]. Note: abnormal laboratory determinations at the 
screening visit that preclude a subject from entering the study or receiving study 
medication are not considered adverse events, but will be captured in order to monitor 
data from screen failures.  
11.4. Recording and reporting adverse events. For the purpose of AE  recording,  
the study period is defined as that time period beginning when the subject signs consent  to 
completion of medical drug taper. All AEs  that occur during the study period must be recorded on 
the AE form, regardless of the severity  of the event or judged relationship to the study medication. 
For SAEs, t he site director, Dr s. Dworkin for UR and Turk at the UW , will be notified by [CONTACT_220268] 24 hours of the site’s notification of the event. Within [ADDRESS_264654] s will be provided an AE -form 
which asks “Since your last visit, have you experienced any new or worsening symtpoms or medical 
problems? If yes, please specify.” Addtionally, subjects are asked i n an identical format if they have 
experienced any new or worsening emotional changes or changes in their ability to concentate or 
reme mber things. All reported or observed signs and symptoms should be recorded individually, 
except when considered manifestations of a medical condition or disease state.  
The clini cal course of each AE  that is active at the final visit should be monitored a t suitable 
 
 
 Page 45 of 54 CONFIDENTIAL  
Study: COMBAT -FM Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_264655] be recorded as one of the choices on the following scale:  
DEFINITE  Causal relationship is certain  (i.e., the temporal relationship between 
medicatio n exposure and the AE  onset/course is reasonable, there is a 
clinically compatible response to dechallenge, other causes have been 
eliminated, and the event must be definitive pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if 
necessary).  
PROBABLY  High degree of certainty for causal relationship  (i.e., the temporal relationship 
between medicatio n exposure and the AE  onset/course is reasonable, there 
is a clinically compatible response to dechallenge [rechallenge is not 
required], and other ca uses have been eliminated or are unlikely).  
POSSIBLY  Causal relationship is uncertain  (i.e., the temporal relationship between 
medication exp osure and the AE onset/course is reasonable or unknown, 
dechallenge/rechallenge information is either unknown or eq uivocal, and 
while other potential causes may or may not exist, a causal relationship to the 
study medication does not appear probable).  
UNLIKELY  Not reasonably related, although a causal relationship cannot be ruled out  
(i.e., while the temporal relations hip between medication exposure and the 
adverse event onset/course does not preclude causality, there is a clear 
alternate cause that is more likely to have caused the AE  than the study 
medication).  
UNRELATED  No possible relationship  (i.e., the temporal re lationship between medication 
exposure and the AE  onset/course is unreasonable or incompatible, or a 
causal relationship to study medication is implausible).  
11.4.2. Severity of an adverse event. The severity of each AE will  be recorded as 1 of the choices  
on the following scale:  
MILD   No limitation of usual activities  
MODERATE  Some limitation of usual activities  
SEVERE  Inability to carry out usual activities  
11.4.3.  Serious Adverse Events (SAE) . 
Definition of an SAE. AEs are classified as either serious or non -serious.  
An SAE is any adverse event occurring at any dose, which results in any of the following outcomes 
or actions:  
• death  
• a life -threatening AE  (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as  it 
occurred); does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death  
• in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_220207] 46 of 54 CONFIDENTIAL  
Study: COMBAT -FM Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 12/16/2014                                               Version 1.0  scheduled before enrollment for an elective procedure or treatment of a pre -existing 
condition, which has not worsened during participation in the study will not be 
considered an SAE.)  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., a substantial disruption of one’s ability 
to conduct normal life functi ons) 
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition; a ny new diagnosis of 
cancer (made after study enrollment) will be considered an important medical event  
An AE  that does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness listed above should be regarded as a 
non-serious advers e event.  
Reporting SAEs. All SAEs that occur either during the study period, regardless of  relationship to 
the study medication, or after the study period, if considered possibly related to study medication or 
participation, must be immediately reported wi thin 24  hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the 
event or, when this occurs on a weekend or federal holiday, at the latest on the following working 
day. The initial report must be made by [CONTACT_220269], with contact 
[CONTACT_220270]:  
• Laurie Al -Nasr (telephone:  [PHONE_4669] ) 
• PD: D. Turk, PhD (telephone: [PHONE_4670] ) 
• PIs: J P. Robinson,  MD, PhD (telephone: 206 998 -0125 ); R. Dworkin , PhD  (telephone: 
[PHONE_4671])  
The site investigator should continue calling until he/she speaks to an individual personally. Do not 
leave a voicemail message, as it is always possible that the person you called is not in the office. 
Within [ADDRESS_264656] also ensure that all data has been entered appropriately into the 
Adverse Events form on REDCap for reconciliation. The timely p rovision of the SAE  Transmittal 
Form should not be delayed in the event that information is partial or incomplete. Follow -up 
information received on all SAEs will follow the same procedure and timelines as indicated above 
for the initial report. Address facsimile t o:  
The P D or PI s will review the submitted information and SAEs determined to be unexpected will be 
forwarded to the  data safety and monitorin board and the  FDA as set forth in [ADDRESS_264657] also ensure that the IEC/IRB is informe d of the event in accordance with local IRB 
reporting requirements.  
11.5. Premature withdrawal from the study.  Any subject who experiences an AE  may be 
withdrawn from the study at any time at the discretion of the investigator. If a subject is withdrawn 
wholly or in part because of an AE , both the  AE page and Study Completion/Withdrawal form will be 
completed at that time. The subject will  be moni tored until the event has resolved or stabilized, 
determination of a cause unrelated to the study is made, or the subject is referred to the care of a 
local physician. The investigator will  report a subject’s premature withdrawal from the study (for any 
reason) to the  PD within 24 hours (or the next working day) of its occurrence. Additional reports 
must be provided when requested.  
11.6. Medical emergencies. Medical emergencies will  be reported to [CONTACT_60966]  (After hours 
calling the paging operator at [ADDRESS_264658] . Robinson paged ). Equipment, 
 
 
 Page 47 of 54 CONFIDENTIAL  
Study: COMBAT -FM Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_264659] the 
PD/PI [INVESTIGATOR_220208]. The investigator, in 
consultation with the PI, will decide whether the subject should continue in the study. All protocol 
deviations and the reasons for such deviations will  be recorded in the study deviations form  (See 
Appendix T). 
12. HUMAN SUBJECTS  
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review and Informed Consent . The study will be  
approved by [CONTACT_220271]’s institution (U W, UR ). The rationale, inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
and procedures will be described in lay terms to potential subjects after they have been referred to 
the study or identified by [CONTACT_11174]. If the potential subject remains interested in participating, 
written informed consent will be obtained b y the investigator or other key study person nel qualified 
to obtain consent.  
12.2. Risks to the Subjects . The study described in this protocol presents greater than minimal  
risk to subjects. This risk involves the potential for side effects and other adverse events from the 
study medications that will be administered to subjects. These medications include generic 
tramadol -IR and acetaminophen, which will be administered to an y subjects with unacceptable pain.  
It can be anticipated that some subjects will have unrelieved pain, either because they are in the 
placebo group, because they do not respond to treatment with generic tramadol -IR or the rescue 
analgesic, or because thes e medications are not efficacious in FM. 
12.3. Subject Confidentiality . The investigator will  ensure that the privacy of the subjects,  
including their personal identity and all personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. 
US sites are reminded that, effective April 14, [ADDRESS_264660] (HIPAA). On the 
eCRFs and other documents participant records , subjects will not  be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but 
by a subject identification number.  
Personal medical information may be reviewed for the purpose of verifying data recorded in the 
CRF. This may be done by [CONTACT_11200], properly authorized persons on behalf of the, or 
regulatory authorities. Personal medical information will always be treated as confidential. All 
records will be kept in a locked file cabinet , or in a password protected electronic data capture 
software, REDCAP.  All computer entry and networking programs will be done using subject 
identification numbers only. Identifiable clinical information will not be released without written 
permission of t he subject, except as required for monitoring by [CONTACT_1201], the FDA, and the OHRP.  
12.4. Adequacy of Protection Against Risks . Subjects will be routinely and carefully evaluated  
for the presence of side effects and other AEs . It can be anticipated that some subjects will have 
unrelieved pain, but the structured approach to providing rescue analgesia will reduce the likelihood 
that subjects will experience unacceptable acute pain during the placebo -controlled phase of the 
trial. Any subje cts who cannot tolerate severe pain that has remained intractable to the blinded 
study medication and treatment with rescue medication will be reminded of their right to exit the trial 
and be referred to a physician with expertise in pain treatment.  
Subjec ts will be unblinded if required for their safety or if the subject needs emergency surgery and

Version Date: 12/16/2014                                               Version 1.0  information about all treatment interventions is requested; this is expected to occur only very rarely. 
Only in the event of an emergency that the investigator feels cannot be adequately treated without 
knowing the identity of the study medication can the medication blind be broken for a particular 
subject. With each shipment of drug kits, sealed codes will also be provided  to the site 
investigators, and these co des must remain sealed under the responsibility of the investigator. In 
the event that an emergency disclosure of treatment assignment is required, a call will be made to 
inform the the P D, PIs, of such disclosure; the actual treatment assignment, however,  will not be 
disclosed to the staff during this phone call.   
12.5. Potential Benefits to Subjects . There are several potential benefits to subjects of  
participating in this study:  
1. Subjects will be evaluated and treated without charge for their FM by [CONTACT_220272] i n FM . 
 2. All subjects will be treated for unacceptable pain using rescue analgesia, and their pain  
    will be carefully monitored and treated throughout the study.  
12.6. Alternatives to Participation . The alternatives to participat ion in this study are for sub jects  
to be treated by [CONTACT_220273] a physician with expertise in FM or pain treatmen t. 
Treatment might also include the use of various medications with analgesic effects, including the 
generic tramadol IR used in this study, for control of the subjec t’s pain.  
12.7. Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children . We propose to include both fem ales and  
males with FM in this project. Since women are substantially more likely to see k treatment for FM (8  
to 1) we expect that a similar female/male ratio will be represented in the current study.  
12.8. Inclusion of Minorities. People with FM of all ethnic and racial groups represented in the  
population of King and surrounding  counties, Washington and Monroe  and surrounding counties, 
[LOCATION_001]. Ethnic and racial composition of King County, Washington is approximately 87% White, 
13% racial and ethnic minorities including 7% Asian, 2% Black, 2% American Indian, and 2% 
Hispanic. The ethnic and racial composition of  Monroe County,  [LOCATION_001] is approximately 80% 
White, 15%  Black, and the remainder  American  and Alaskan  Indian,  Asian, and  Native Hawaiian 
and Other Pacific Islanders, with approximately 6%  persons of Hispanic or Latino origin .  
Investigative staff at both sites  (UW, UR)  will make every effort to enroll all patients who meet 
eligibility criteria in the proposed trial, irrespective of race or ethnicity, and the databases have been 
designed to collect all information regarding race and ethnicity according  to the NIH guidelines.  We 
will monitor the racial and ethnic composition of our sample. If  the distribution of subject s recruited 
is substantially different from th e general distribution in King County, WA, Monroe C ounty, NY and 
surrounding counties, we w ill actively recruit an increased number of members of the under -
represented minorities by [CONTACT_220274]. S pecial efforts will be devoted to  enrolling  Black and Latino subjects, and 
the goal will be to have 15% minority participation.  Efforts to ensure adequate recruitment of 
minority subjects will include: (1) the PIs and their staffs will closely monitor recruitment of minority 
subjects, develop plans to actively recru it minority subjects through community lay groups and via 
direct contacts with minority organizations in the local areas, and also ensure that efforts to 
increase enrollment emphasize recruitment of minorities; (2) local minority recruitment initiatives wi ll 
include targeted advertising in minority publications and in support of efforts to actively recruit 
minority subjects through community organizations; (3) speaking engagements will be scheduled by 
[CONTACT_220275]; (4) materials will be developed and advertising undertaken to 
publicize the trial in local  and regional newsletters and newspapers with predominantly minority 
readership; and  (5) the resources of the NIH -funded centers on minority recruitment will be used to

Study: COMBAT -FM Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_264661] (AR44724) has demonstrated that we are able to recruit 
targeted populations. We will aggressively attempt to recruit racial -ethnic monitories by (1) creating 
an advisory board of racial and ethnic minorities from t he community to provide advice on 
recruitment, (2) advertise the project in media that target minorities, and (3) place information about 
the study in venues that are likely to be seen by [CONTACT_105990] (churches, community centers, health 
clinics locate in ar eas of high concentration of minorities.  
12.9. Study Modification/Discontinuation . The study may be modified or discontinued at  
any time by [CONTACT_1201], the NI AMS , the OHRP, the FDA, or other government agencies as part of 
their duties to ensure that researc h subjects are protected.  
13. PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS  
Publication of the results of this trial will be governed by [CONTACT_220276] . Any presentation, abstract, or manuscript will be made available for review by [CONTACT_220277].

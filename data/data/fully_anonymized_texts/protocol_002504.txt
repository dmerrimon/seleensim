CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 9  
The purpose of this amendment is to align the dosing regimen of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912430], globally, for this patient population. Criteria 
for the events that require accelerated reporting to the sponsor were updated to align with current 
standards for the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912431]. Additionally, the Finland 
country -specific amendments and Poland country -specific amendments were merged into one 
global protocol. The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and the rationale.  
Change  Section Cha nged  
The dosing regimen of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg was 
changed from weekly (qw) to every 2 weeks  (q2w) 
starting from visit 25 until the end of the treatment 
period to match the dosing regimen approved by 
[CONTACT_309659], globally, for this 
patient population.  
As dosing of study drug will be less frequent, 
several in -clinic visits for sup plying study drug for 
at-home administration (V26, 28, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 
and 42) were removed since these visits are no 
longer needed.  Synopsis : Study Design; Treatments

CONFIDENTIAL  Change  Section Cha nged  
Clarified/updated list of adverse events of special 
interest (AESIs) including addition of clinically 
symptomatic eosinophilia and removal of 
malignancy and suicide -related events per health 
authority request. The AESI definition for 
conjunctivitis and ble pharitis was revised to remove 
the criteria for events lasting ≥4 week s. This change 
was made because i n previous dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912432], events of mild to 
moderate severity were not found to be clinically 
meaningful, even when lasting >[ADDRESS_1282025] current version

The main purpose of this amendment is to streamline and simplify the schedule of study visits and 
procedures.  This is expect ed to facilitate the implementation of the protocol at participating study 
centers, decrease the burden for study patients, and improve their compliance.  At the time of 
implementing this amendment, data has been generated from more than [ADDRESS_1282038] 
completed one year in the study.  Consequently, at this stage, it has become possible to remove the

studies expected to participate in this study.  
• Revise inclusion criterion [ADDRESS_1282041] been screened for a phase 3 study (R668 -AD-1334 and -1416), but could 
not be randomized in the phase 3 studies due to randomization closure, to provide 
these patients (who meet the eligibility criteria for this open -label study) the 
opportunity for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24736]; and to make edits for clarity

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc . Page 21 of 124 
CONFIDENTIAL  • To clarify that in order to become eligible for the open -label extension study, patients 
enrolled in previous A D studies must adequately complete the assessments required 
for both the treatment and follow -up periods of those particular studies; to further 
clarify that adequate completion of these assessments includes undergoing at least 
2 landmark visits, as define d in each study protocol:  (1) primary endpoint visit, 
which is usually the end of treatment visit, and (2) end of study visit as defined in 
each study protocol, as well as completing all other assessments during the treatment 
and follow -up periods for at least 50% of the timepoints allocated to each assessment, 
unless the protocol of the previous study allows earlier transition into the open -label 
extension, in which case these requirements apply up to the point when this transition 
is permitted.  
• To remove  systemic corticosteroids (including topi[INVESTIGATOR_160788]) as a prohibited and 
restricted medication.  Since this is a long -term study, it is anticipated that some 
patients may use systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of concurrent atopic 
conditions, suc h as asthma, which are commonly associated with AD.  
• To clarify that resumption of study treatment after temporary discontinuation will 
require written approval from the medical monitor.  
• To add inadequate efficacy as a reason for permanent discontinuation f rom the study 
drug, and from the study in response to the German Ethics Committee request.  
• To remove the requirement to administer 400 mg SC dupi[INVESTIGATOR_71757] a loading dose 
(ie, 200 mg initial dose, and 200 mg loading dose) for patients treated in a previous 
AD study unless the last dose administered is less than [ADDRESS_1282050] dose in the 
current study, as their dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912450] a result of 
their participation in their previous study.  
• To clarify that training on self - injection or injection administered by a caregiver will 
not be required if training occurred in the previous study; to remove the requirement 
that patients will be monitored at the study site for [ADDRESS_1282051] 5 
injections.  
• To remove inclusion criterion #2 requiring IGA ≥[ADDRESS_1282052] low disease severity scores.  
• To more clearly define the basis on which a patient will be excluded from the 
open -label extension study.  
• To modify exclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_1282053] 12 months for any indication, or 5 years for dermatological 
indications, to the new requirement of within 5 half -lives (if known), or [ADDRESS_1282054] dose in the open -label extension study.  Because 
patients were already screened for this exclusion criteria in their previous studies, this 
criteria was modified so as not to screen out patients who participated in clinical trials 
with biologics for AD (eg, Stelara) in the past 5 years.

Title  AN OPEN -LABEL STUDY OF DUPI[INVESTIGATOR_912451] 500 global study sites.  
Objectives  The primary objective is to assess the long -term safety of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912452] (AD).  
The secondary objective of the study is to assess the immunogenicity of 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912453], in the context of re -treatment, and 
to monitor efficacy parameters associated with long -term treatment.  
Sub-Study Objectives:  The primary objective of the sub -study is to assess the safety of the new 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912454].  
The secondary objectives of the sub -study are to evaluate systemic 
exposure and immunogenicity of the new dupi[INVESTIGATOR_125308] b drug product in 
patients with AD.  
Study Design  This is a multicenter, open -label extension (OLE) study to assess the 
long-term safety and efficacy of repeat doses of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912455] -to-severe AD who have previously participated in 
controlled studies of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912456] a phase 3 
study (R668 -AD-1334 or R668 -AD-1416), but could not be 
randomized due to randomization closure.  
Enrollment will take place at approximately [ADDRESS_1282056] visit in the previo us study, in which case 
assessments that are common to both studies will be performed only 
once.   
A loading dose of 600 mg SC (two 300 mg doses administered on the 
same day) dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912457] [ADDRESS_1282057] dose in the previous study,  and 
then 300 mg SC dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912458] ( qw) starting on day 8. For patients 
who have not completed the study prior to the implementation of 
amendment 9, study drug dosing will change from dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg 
qw to every 2 weeks  (q2w).  
Patients will return for v isits that are spaced 4 to 1 6 weeks apart, as 
specified in the protocol.  The study treatment duration will be up to 
5 years.  The end of study visit occurs 12 weeks after the end of 
treatment visit.  As of the date of issue of amendment 8, this study is 
closed to further enrollment.

CONFIDENTIAL  Approximately 50  patients who are participating in the current ongoing 
OLE  study (R668 -AD-1225) and have not completed the  end of 
treatment  visit ( ie, visit 44) prior to the implementation of 
amendment  [ADDRESS_1282058] 12  weeks  (some patients may be treated for 24  weeks) .  The end 
of study visit for patients participating in the sub -study under 
amendment 10  will be 84 days (12  weeks) after the last dose using the  
new dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912459].   Patients who enter the sub -study from 
either visit [ADDRESS_1282059] the duration of 
their study treatment  increased by 4 or 12 weeks, respectively.  
Patients and/or caregivers who are willing and able to administer 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912460] b een trained during their participation in 
the previous study.  These patients will self -inject study drug (or have 
the drug administered by a caregiver) during weeks in which no clinic 
visit is scheduled.  Safety, laboratory, and clinical assessments will be 
performed at specified clinic visits.  
Patients who receive treatment with a prohibited or restricted 
medication will be discontinued from study drug for the duration of the 
prohibited treatment (plus 5 half -lives as applicable).  Study treatment 
may be resumed only if approved by [CONTACT_7195].  
Patients who test positive for anti -drug antibody (ADA) at their last 
study visit (early termination or end of study) may, based on the 
benchmark ADA titer in effect at the time, be asked to return to the 
clinic to have additional ADA samples collected for analysis within [ADDRESS_1282060] dose of study drug, and thereafter at 
intervals of approximately 3  to 6 months until their titers fall below the 
benchmark titer.  
Study Duration  The study treatment duration will be up to 5 years.  
Population   
Sample Size:  The study is open to patients who participated in controlled and/or 
short -term dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912461] a phase 3 
study (R668 -AD-1334 or R668 -AD-1416), but could not be 
randomized because of randomization closure.  Based on the numbers 
of patients enrolled or screened in the antecedent dupi[INVESTIGATOR_161267], it 
is currently anticipated that approximately [ADDRESS_1282061] s (IRBs)/Ethics Committees (ECs) 
will be notified if there is more than 25% greater participation than 
currently anticipated.  
Target Population:  The target population includes adult (≥18 years of age) patients with 
AD who participated in a prior dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912462].

this open -label study.  These include the proportions for category 
endpoints and basic statistics of original, absolute, and percentage 
change from baseline for continuous endpoints.  All observed data will 
be used for analysis.  
A summary of safety results (reported TEAEs and clinical laboratory 
evaluations) will be presented.  
The following drug concentration analyses will be conducted: 
descriptive statistics at each samplin g time and least square mean 
analysis for concentration at steady -state.  No formal statistical analysis 
will be performed.  
Listings of ADA positivity and titers presented by [CONTACT_912518].  Prevalence of ADA will be assessed as a bsolute 
occurrence (N) and percent of patients (%), grouped by [CONTACT_912519].

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
1.1. Introduction  
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic/relapsing inflammatory skin disease characterized by [CONTACT_912520] (eg, itchiness), and by [CONTACT_912521].  It is often associated with other 
atopic  disorders, such as allergic rhinitis and asthma.  Severe disease can be extremely disabling 
due to major psychological problems, significant sleep loss, and impaired quality of life (QOL) 
that leads to high socioeconomic costs.  An estimated 15% to 30% of  children and 2% to 10% of 
adults are affected by [CONTACT_22802] ( Beiber 2008 ). 
The pathophysiology of AD is influenced by a complex interplay between immunoglobulin 
E (IgE) -mediated sensitization, the immune system, and environmental fa ctors.  The primary skin 
defect may be an immunologic disturbance that causes IgE -mediated sensitization, with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -barrier dysfunction that could be the consequence of both genetic mutations and local 
inflammation.  
Skin-infiltrating lymphocytes are thought to play a pi[INVESTIGATOR_912467].  The key cells involved in the patho -physiologic mechanism of AD are 
classified into [ADDRESS_1282071], dendritic cell subtypes, including Langerhans cells  and 
inflammatory dendritic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], polarize T -helper cells via IgE - and non -IgE-mediated 
mechanisms.  Dendritic cells in the skin take up and present allergens to lymphocytes, causing a 
Type 2 helper T cell (Th2) polarization and subsequent rele ase of pro -inflammatory cytokines, 
which include interleukin (IL) -4, IL -5, and IL -13.  The T -helper cells are the second group of cells.  
In acute exudative skin lesions, chemokine ‘C’ receptor (CCR4+) Th2 cells are abundant and 
secrete cytokines IL -4, IL -13, and IL -5; whereas Type 1 helper T cells (Th1), which secrete 
interferon -gamma (IFN -γ), are also seen in chronic, lichenified lesions.  Activated eosinophils are 
the third group of cells, causing local inflammation at lesional sites.  Keratinocytes are the fourth 
cell-type involved in the pathophysiology of AD.  These skin cells express high levels of the Th2 
polarizing cytokine, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, in AD lesions which may amplify and sustain 
the allergic response.  
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], a fully human mono clonal antibody, is directed against the IL -4 receptor alpha 
(IL-4Rα) subunit, which is a component of IL -[ADDRESS_1282072] frequently prescribed class of drugs; however, long term application of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_912468], dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
acneiform eru ptions, and risks associated with systemic absorption (eg, growth retardation, 
hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_173747], etc.).  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_912469] -term treatments, but concerns of skin malignancies and incr eased risk of 
lymphomas have prompted regulatory authorities to require a warning in the prescribing 
information of topi[INVESTIGATOR_12868].  Repeated application of any topi[INVESTIGATOR_912470] a long period of time leads to reduced patient compli ance.  Antihistamines, which are

their effectiveness is limited.  Oral immunosuppressants ( Schmitt 2007 ) and glucocorticoids are  
effective, but are sometimes associated with severe toxicity and side effects, thus limiting their use 
to short courses and/or intermittent therapy.  Patients' disease often rebounds when the treatment 
is stopped, especially after the administration of sy stemic glucocorticoids ( Schmitt  2009 , 
Schram  2012 , Akhavan 2008 ).  Biological agents including anti -tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, 
anti-IgE (omalizumab), anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab), and anti -CD11a (efalizumab) have generally 
been ineffective in clinical trials.  
Up-regulation of IL -[ADDRESS_1282073] numerous and considerable side effects including diabetes, hypertension, 
and osteoporosis for corticosteroids (as well as the risk of rebound after steroid discontinuation), 
myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity for methotrexate, nephrotoxicity and hypertension for 
cyclosporine, and gastrointestinal disturbances and leucopenia for azathioprine.  In addition, the 
broad immunosuppression cau sed by [CONTACT_912522][INVESTIGATOR_245569], fungal, viral, and mycobacterial infections, compared with the targeted Th2 inhibition.

1.2. Rationale  
1.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
The primary purpose of the study is to collect long -term safety data on patients treated with 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912471] -term exposure.  
This study may be an incentive to patients enrolling in placebo -controlled trials (eg, phase 2b and 
phase 3), as patients are eventually provided with the opportunity to receive dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912472].  
Eligible patients must have received any study treatment and completed the specified assessments 
in the prior dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912473] a phase 3 study (R668 -AD-1334 
or R668 -AD-1416), but could not be randomized because of randomization closure.  This study 
will provide useful information on re -exposure to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], particularly regarding the potential 
for immunogenicity associated with a new course of treatment, as well as the relatio nships between 
anti-dupi[INVESTIGATOR_245539], dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912474] (trough) concentration, and clinical parameters.

CONFIDENTIAL  1.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
Patients enrolled in this study initially received weekly (qw) doses of 300 mg subcutaneous (SC) 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].  
A loading do se of 600 mg SC (two 300 mg doses administered on the same day) dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912475] [ADDRESS_1282074] 
dose in the previous study, and then 300 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912476] 8.  
A phase 2b dose -ranging study (R668 -AD-1021) evaluated dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912477] 
300 mg qw, 300 mg  once every 2 weeks  (q2w), [ADDRESS_1282075] superior efficacy compared with control, as well as an 
acceptable safety profile. There were no statistically significant differences in efficacy between 
300 mg qw and 300 mg q2w. The dose used in this Open -Label Extension (OLE) study remained 
[ADDRESS_1282076].  
As part of  the sub -study, s afety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity endpoints before 
and after switching to the new dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912478].

R668 -AD-1416), but could no t be randomized because of randomization closure.  
Enrollment will take place at approximately [ADDRESS_1282078] visit in the previous study, in which case assessments that are 
common to both studies will be performed only once.  
A loading dose of 600 mg SC (two 300 mg doses administered on the same day) dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912475] [ADDRESS_1282079] not completed the study prior to the implementation of amendment 9, study drug dosing will 
change from dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg weekly to every 2 weeks .  
Patients will return for visits as specified in Section  6.  In order to minimize the amount of drug 
that patients need to store in thei r home between visits, some visits will be abbreviated for the 
primary purpose to receive additional drug supply.  The study treatment duration will be up to 
5 years.  The end of study visit occurs at 84 days/[ADDRESS_1282080] elapsed since their end of 
                                        VV-RIM-00152209-1.0 Approved - 11 May 2021 GMT-5:00

Patients and/or caregivers who are willing and able to administer dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912479].  These patients will self -inject study drug (or have the drug 
administered by a caregiver) during weeks in which no clinic visit is scheduled.  Safety, laboratory, 
and clinical assessments will be performed at specif ied clinic visits.  
Patients who receive treatment with a prohibited or restricted medication will be discontinued from 
study drug for the duration of the prohibited treatment (plus 5 half -lives as applicable).  Study 
treatment may be resumed only if approv ed by [CONTACT_7195].  
Patients who test positive for anti-drug antibodies ( ADA s) at their last study visit (early 
termination or end of study) may be asked to return to the clinic to have additional ADA samples 
collected for analysis (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for details and time points).

PATIENTS  
4.1. Number of Patients Planned  
The study is open to patients who participated in controlled and/or short term dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912482] a phase 3 study (R668 -AD-1334 or R668 -AD-1416), 
but could not be randomized due to randomization closure.  Based on the numbers of patients 
enrolled or screened in the antecedent dupi[INVESTIGATOR_161267], it is currently anticipated that 
approximate ly 2500 patients will be enrolled in this global study.  Institutional Review Boards 
(IRBs)/Ethics Committees (ECs) will be notified if there is more than 25% greater participation 
than currently anticipated.  
Sub-Study:  
Approximately [ADDRESS_1282094] not completed the 
end of treatment  visit ( ie, visit 44)  prior to the implementation of amendment [ADDRESS_1282095]  at sub -study visit  1a.   
4.2. Study Population  
The target population includes adult patients (≥18 years of age) with AD who participated in a 
prior dupi[INVESTIGATOR_209399].  
4.2.1.  Inclusion Criteria  
A patient  must meet the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study:  
1. Participation in a prior clinical trial of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912483] a nd met one of the following:  
a. Received study treatment and adequately completed the assessments required for both 
the treatment and follow -up periods of the parent studies (except studies listed in b) as 
defined in the parent protocols; specifically,  patien ts must complete the primary 
endpoint visit and at least 50% of the scheduled in -clinic visits and at -home 
assessments*).  Additionally, patients who discontinued a parent study prematurely (ie, 
patients who did not complete the protocol -defined end -of-study visit) cannot enroll 
into this open -label extension study before the date when the end -of-study visit would 
have normally occurred.  Completion of the entire follow -up period is not required for 
parent studies where the protocol specifically allows for an earlier transition into the 
open -label extension, in which case these requirements apply up to the point of this 
early transition.  
* For at -home assessments (eg, patient reported outcomes by [CONTACT_912523] [ IVRS ] calls), patients who completed less than 50% of the 
assessments may be eligible if technical issues (eg,  IVRS system malfunction) or 
other documented objective circumstances contributed to missing assessments, 
subject to approval by [CONTACT_7195].

the instructions received during the study, as assessed by [CONTACT_093].   
c. Unde rwent screening in R668 -AD-1334 (Liberty AD SOLO 1) or R668 -AD-1416 
(Liberty AD SOLO 2), but could not be randomized due to randomization closure.   
These patients must have met the inclusion criteria for the Liberty AD SOLO studies 
that were applicable at  the screening visit, specifically:  
• Chronic AD, (according to American Academy of Dermatology Consensus 
Criteria [ Eichenfield 2014 ]), that has been present for at least 3 years before the 
screening visit  
• Eczema  Area and Severity Index (EASI) score ≥16 at the screening visit  
• Investigator’s  Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥3 (on the 0 to 4 IGA scale, in 
which 3 is moderate and 4 is severe) at the screening visit  
• ≥10% body surface area (BSA) of AD involvement at the screening visit 
• Documented recent history (within 6 months before the screening visit) of 
inadequate response to treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_319033] (eg, because of important side 
effects or safety ri sks)*  
* With the clarification notes provided in the SOLO protocols.  
For these patients, the following criteria must also apply at the baseline visit in 
this open -label study:  
• EASI score ≥16  
• IGA score ≥3  
• ≥10% BSA of AD involvement  
2. Must be ≥18 years of age at screening  
3. Willing and able to comply with all clinic visits and study -related procedures  
4. Able to understand and complete study -related questionnaires  
5. Provide signed informed consent  
Sub-Study:  
Additional inclusion criteria that must be met before a patient can enter the sub -study and switch 
to the new dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912429] (per amendment 10) are provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .

5.1. Investigational Treatment  
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912492] (PFS) for SC administration of 
300 mg at a concentration of 150 mg/mL.  
Study treatment will begin on day 1 (baseline).  Patients and/or caregivers who are willing and 
able to self -administer some dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912493] b een trained during their participation in the previous study.  
These patients will self -inject study drug (or have the study drug administered by a caregiver) 
during weeks in which no clinic visit is scheduled.  
Patients who prefer to have the clinic staff administer each dose of study drug may have all 
injections administered in the clinic.  
A loading dose of 600 mg SC (two 300 mg doses administered on the same day) dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912475] [ADDRESS_1282102] 4 weeks, then they will 
receive a single 300 mg dose at baseline).  The first dose should be at least [ADDRESS_1282103] not completed the study prior to the implementation of amendment 9, study drug dosing will 
change from dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg weekly to every 2 weeks. If these patients (or their caregivers) 
require inj ection training, a study staff member can administer the first of the 2  injections and the 
patient (or caregiver) can subsequently administer the second injection under the supervision of 
the clinic staff.  
Patients who have either previously completed trea tment or completed the study as per 
amendment  7 and who resume treatment under amendment 7 or 8 will receive a loading dose of 
600 mg SC (two 300 mg doses administered on the same day) if more than [ADDRESS_1282104] 300  mg SC q2w.

5.2.1.  Dose Modification  
Dose modification for an individual patient is not allowed.  
5.2.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug will be asked to return to the clinic for early 
termination assessments, per Section  6.2.8 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Patients will be permanently discontinued from study drug dosing in the event of:  
• Anaphylactic reaction or other severe systemic reaction to study drug  
• Diagnosis of a malignancy during study, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or 
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin  
• Pregnancy at any time during the study  
• Any infection that is opportunistic, such as active tuberculosis and oth er infections 
whose nature or course may suggest an immuno -compromised status  
• Severe laboratory abnormalities that are judged to be related to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912494]  7.3.2 , such as:  
− Neutrophil count ≤0.5 x 103/µL 
− Platelet count ≤50 x 103/µL 
− Confirmed (by [ADDRESS_1282105] 2 weeks apart) alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values >3 x uppe r limit of normal 
(ULN) and total bilirubin >[ADDRESS_1282106], excluding confirmed Gilbert’s Syndrome  
− Confirmed AST and/or ALT >[ADDRESS_1282107] (for more than 2 weeks)  
• Inadequate efficacy:  
− Patients who show inadequate therapeutic response after at least 12 weeks of 
treatment with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912495].  For the purpose of this assessment, a review of efficacy will be triggered 
whenever patients f ail to achieve and/or maintain EASI -25 (at least 
25% improvement in the EASI score) at week 16, compared to the baseline score 
in the previous controlled and/or short -term study.  Patients may also withdraw 
from the study at any time if they are not satisf ied with the study treatment (see 
Section  4.3) 
• Other reasons that may lead to the permanent discontinuation of study drug include:  
− Certain AEs deemed  related to the study drug (eg, severe and prolonged ISRs)

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug must be discontinued in case of:  
• Severe laboratory abnormalities (as noted in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) where a causal 
relationship to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_474754] (ie, an alternative cause is 
evident).  In these cases, study treatment will be discontinued (at least 1 dose while the 
clinical circumstances are being assessed), but it may be resumed when the laboratory 
parameters normalize sufficiently.  A decision to resume study treatment will be made 
jointly by [CONTACT_663563].  
Study drug dosing may be tempor arily discontinued in the event of:  
• Clinically important laboratory abnormalities, such as:  
− Neutrophil count ≤1.0 x 103/µL but >0.5 x 103/µL 
− Platelet count ≤100 x 103/µL but >50 x 103/µL 
− Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) >[ADDRESS_1282108], unless the increase can be cl early 
attributed to physical exertion and considered clinically inconsequential.  
• Other intercurrent illnesses or major surgery  
• Any severe infection; any bacterial or viral infection requiring systemic treatment and 
remaining unresolved after 2  weeks of app ropriate treatment; any clinical helminth 
endoparasitosis; any opportunistic infection  
• Treatment with a live (attenuated) vaccine.  Study drug dosing will be suspended for at 
least 12 weeks.  NOTE:  If the need for live vaccination is known in advance, to the 
extent possible, stop study drug for 12 weeks prior to vaccination  
• Treatment with systemic nonsteroidal immunosuppressive/immunomodulating 
medications (eg, cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate -mofetil, 
Janus kinase inhibitors, biolog ic agents, etc)  
After the condition leading to temporary discontinuation of study drug resolves and/or the 
laboratory abnormality leading to suspension of dosing normalizes sufficiently, study drug dosing 
may resume at the discretion of the principal inves tigator in consultation with the medical monitor.  
Similarly, study treatment may resume after the medication leading to suspension of dosing has 
been discontinued.  A decision to temporarily discontinue study drug and/or to resume study drug 
dosing should  be discussed with the medical monitor.  Resumption of study drug will require the 
medical monitor’s written approval.  The investigator may discontinue study drug dosing at any 
time, even without consultation with the medical monitor if the urgency of the  situation requires 
immediate action and if this is determined to be in the patient’s best interest.  However, the medical 
monitor should be contact[CONTACT_25002].  
Resumption of study treatment after tempo rary discontinuation should always be discussed with 
the medical monitor and will require the medical monitor’s written approval.

Any treatment administered from the time of informed consent to the final study visit will be 
considered concomi tant medication.  This includes medications that were started before the study 
and are ongoing during the study.  
5.5.1.  Permitted Medications and Procedures  
Other than the prohibited medications listed in Section  5.5.2 , treatment with concomitant 
medications are permitted during the study.  This includes treatment with contraceptives, basic 
skin care (cleansing and bathing including bleach baths), emollient s, topi[INVESTIGATOR_12866], 
antihistamines, topi[INVESTIGATOR_71840] -infective medications for any duration, topi[INVESTIGATOR_74018], topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], and systemic corticosteroids.

not been studied and the effect of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181194] -4 and IL -13 has not been fully 
characterized.   
However, IL -4 was reported to upregulate CYP2E1, 2B6, 3A4 mRNA expression or downregulate 
CYP1A2 mRNA ( Abdel -Razzak 1993 , Christensen 2012 ).  Human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells incubated with various Th2 cytokines showed that IL -4 and IL -13 increased mRNA 
expression of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 ( Liptrott 2009 ). 
Since the clinical significance of the limited in vitro findings for IL -[ADDRESS_1282109] up to the end of follow -up, investigators are cautioned to monitor 
clinical and laboratory signs that might indicate a potential drug -drug interaction in all patients 
receiving dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912496]450.  This means that close clinical observation and/or laboratory monitoring 
as applicable are required in order to enable early detection of toxic manifestations or lack of 
activity/efficacy of these drugs, followed by [CONTACT_912525], if needed.  
5.5.2.  Prohibited and Restricted Medications  
Concomitant treatment with the following medications is prohibited during the study.  These 
medications should generally be avoided, but if they are medically necessary (eg, as a rescue 
treatment for i ntolerable AD symptoms or to manage serious intercurrent conditions), they may be 
administered while the study drug is discontinued.

*Note:  The screening visit in this study may coincide with the last visit in the previous study.  Assessments that are commo n to both studies will be performed 
only once.  
a. Patients who fail screening or who fail to complete the baseline visit within 28 days of screening may be rescreened upon approval by [CONTACT_601707].  
b. A loading dose of 600 mg SC (two 300 mg doses administered on the same day) dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912457] [ADDRESS_1282113] dose in the previous study, and then 300 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_912476] 8.  In 
addition to the predose assessments, vital signs and AEs will be assessed at 30 (+/ - 10) minutes postdose.  
c. Study drug will be administered weekly, either in th e clinic or outside the clinic (self -administration or administration by a care provider). For patients who 
have not completed the study prior to the implementation of amendment 9, study drug dosing will change from dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg weekly to every 2 weeks . 
d. If needed, counsel patient on proper dosing diary completion/reporting of each dose of study drug that is administered outsid e of the clinic  
e. Starting at visit 2, study drug will be dispensed to the patient for all doses that will be administered before the next clinic visit.  Patients will be instructed to 
return all study drug at each clinic visit.  
f. To be collected before the injection of study drug.  The order of the assessment should be questionnaires first, followed by [CONTACT_436851] .   
g. The questionnaires will be administered only to the subset of patients who fluently speak the language for which a validated translation of the questionnaire is 
available.  
h. In the event the patient experiences a visible ISR at any clinic visit, the clinical site may photograph the ISR and complete  the ISR worksheet.   
i. Patients will be trained on using the IVRS/IWRS at the baseline visit, and will call into the system weekl y to report the overall intensity of their pruritus over 
the previous week, and to record compliance with self -injection of study drug.  
j. Any of these tests is required only for patients who have not had a documented negative result for the respective tes t within 1 year prior to baseline (the 
negative HIV result must be from a parent study).  
k. An acceptable window for performing ophthalmology exams is within +/ - [ADDRESS_1282114] the tes ting 
done at the study site.  
m. Visits 3, 4, 5, and 7 were removed per amendment 6.

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Physical Examination  
A thorough and complete physical examination, including weight, height, will be performed at 
time points according t o Section  6.2. Care should be taken to examine and assess any abnormalities 
that may be present, as indicated by [CONTACT_102]’s medical history.  
6.3.2.  Safety Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Vital Signs  
Sitting vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], will 
be collected predose at time points according to Section  6.2.  Vital signs will be taken at 30  (+/-10) 
minutes post -injection at visit [ADDRESS_1282137] -injection observation.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Ophthalmological Examination  
This exam will be performed for certain patient s of interest, as decided by [CONTACT_912526], at select study centers that have access and can refer 
patients to an eye specialist, either a General ophthalmologist or a Cornea and External Eye 
Disease (‘fr ont-of-the-eye’) subspecialty expert.  Any baseline findings will be documented as part 
of the patient’s medical history and/or physical exam, as appropriate.  Any inflammatory 
ophthalmological condition that occurs post -baseline will be captured as an AE.   Additional tests 
and assessments may be performed to help understand the AEs.  The method and procedure for 
the exam are provided in the study reference manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Injection Site Reaction  
Clinical staff may photograph the site and complete the ISR electronic case report form ( eCRF ), 
in the event a patient experiences a visible ISR.  Instructions for taking the photograph are provided 
in the study reference manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Laboratory Testing  
Hematology, chemistry and serum pregnancy samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory.  
Blood samples for serum chemistry testing will be collected to measure overall patient health at 
screening.  Total basophil and eosinophil counts are of particular interest in AD patients, due to 
the occurrence of basophil histamin e release and eosinophilia in this population.  Understanding 
the lymphocyte profiles of AD patients may help researchers understand disease heterogeneity.  
Detailed instructions for blood sample collection are in the laboratory manual provided to study 
sites.

CONFIDENTIAL  6.3.3.  Efficacy Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Investigator’s Global Assessment  
The IGA is an assessment scale us ed in clinical studies to determine severity of AD and clinical 
response to treatment based on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (very severe).  The IGA 
score will be assessed at time points according to Section  6.2. 
The IGA is provided in the study reference manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Eczema Area and Severity Index  
The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the se verity 
and extent of AD ( Hanifin 2001 ).  Four AD disease characteristics will be assessed for severity by 
[CONTACT_12903] a scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (severe).  In addition, the area 
of AD involvement  will be assessed as a percentage by [CONTACT_12904], trunk, arms, and legs, 
and converted to a score of 0 to 6.  The EASI will be collected at time points according to 
Section  6.2. 
The EASI assessment tool is provided in the study reference manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Patient Oriented Eczema Measure  
The POEM is a 7 -item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess 
disease symptoms in children and adults ( Charman 2004 ).  The format is a response to 7  items 
(dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) with a scoring system of 0 
to 28; a high score is indicative of a poor QOL.   The questionnaires will be administered only to 
the subset of patients who fluently speak the language for which a validated translation of the 
questionnaire is available, at time points according to Section  6.2. 
The POEM is provided in the study reference manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dermatology Life Quality Index  
The DLQI is a [ADDRESS_1282140] of AD disease symptoms and treatment on QOL ( Badia 1999 ).  The format is a simple 
response to [ADDRESS_1282141] week, with an overall scoring system of 0 
to 30; a high score is indicative of a  poor QOL.  The questionnaires will be administered only to 
the subset of patients who fluently speak the language for which a validated translation of the 
questionnaire is available, at time points according to Section  6.2. 
The DLQI is provided in the study reference manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  EQ-5D 
The EQ -5D is a standardized measure of health status developed by [CONTACT_173895] a simple, generi c measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal.  The EQ -5D as 
a measure of health related QOL, defines health in terms of 5 dimensions:  mobility, self -care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  Each dimension has 3  ordinal levels of 
severity:  “no problem” (1), “some problems” (2), “severe problems” (3).  Overall health state is 
defined as a 5 -digit number.  Health states defined by [CONTACT_941] 5-dimensional classification can be 
converted into corresponding index scores that quanti fy health status, where 0 represents “death”

patients who fluently speak the language for which a validated translation of the questionnaire is 
available, at time points according to Section  6.2. 
The EQ -5D is provided in the study reference manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale  
The Pruritus NRS is a simple assessment tool that patients will use to report the average intensity 
of their pruritus (itch), during a 1 week recall period.  Patients will access the IVRS/IWRS weekly, 
preferably around the same time each week, and be asked the following questio n: 
• For average itch intensity: “On a scale of 0 – 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ and 10 being 
the ‘worst itch imaginable’, how would you rate your itch overall, which is on 
average, during the past week?”  
Patients will be trained on using the IVRS/IWRS to reco rd their Pruritus NRS score at the baseline 
visit, and visit 6, and will be queried by [CONTACT_912527] (and any 
unscheduled) clinic visit.  Patients will complete the rating scale weekly through the last study 
visit, according t o Section  6.2. 
6.3.4.  Pharmacokinetic and Antibody Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Drug Concentration Measurements and Samples  
Samples for drug concentration will be collected  at time points listed in Section  6.2.  Any unused 
serum samples collected for drug concentration measurements may be used to investigate 
unexpecte d AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Antibody Measurements and Samples  
Samples for ADA assessment will be collected at time points listed in Section  6.2. 
Patients who test positi ve for ADA at their last study visit (early termination or end of study) may, 
based on the benchmark ADA titer in effect at the time, be asked to return to the clinic to have 
additional ADA samples collected for analysis within [ADDRESS_1282142] dose of study 
drug, and thereafter at intervals of approximately 3 to 6  months until their titers fall below the 
benchmark titer.  
6.3.5.  Research Testing  
Per amendment 6, research samples, optional genomics sub -study, and biomarker testing 
assessments will no  longer be collected.  
Any samples left  over may be used to investigate unexpected AEs.  Residual samples will be stored 
for up to 15 years after the study closes for exploratory research purposes.

unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findi ng), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a preexist ing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
7.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated to 
study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient  is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient  is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869] .  
In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24927] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (any duration) or an 
emergency room visit for longer than 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28683] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24929], or is 
prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by [CONTACT_28807].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s 
ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient  or may 
require intervention to prevent 1 of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg,  intensive 
treatment in an emer gency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse).

adjustments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy  
Contact [CONTACT_109992], although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as a n 
AE. 
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale outlined 
in Section  7.3.1 . 
7.2.6.  Follow -up 
Adverse event information will be collected until the  patient ’s last study visit.  
Serious adverse event information will be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.  
7.3. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
7.3.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs wil l be graded according to the following scale:  
• Mild:   Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient ’s normal functioning 
level.  It may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of 
symptoms, but may be given bec ause of personality of the patient . 
• Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health.  It is 
uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
• Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning o r incapacitation and is a definite 
hazard to the patient ’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or patient  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].

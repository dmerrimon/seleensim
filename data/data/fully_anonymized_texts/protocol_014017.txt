1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study Design  
 The objective of this non- randomized, open label study  is to evaluate the safety and  efficacy of an 
intraoperative imaging system, the LUM Imaging System (LUM015 in conjunction with imaging device LUM 2.6), in identifying residual cancer in the tumor bed of female breast cancer subject s.   
The study is composed of a Feasibility Trial  divided into Phase A  (up to 15 total subjects , 
completed as of December 4, 2015 ) and Phase B (up to 50 total subjects) . Phase A include d 5 
subjects not injected with LUM015 for autofluorescence tissue assessment and 10 subjects receiving LUM015 (as outlined below) to assess the ability to distinguish LUM015 from autofluorescence. Phase A conclude d with the analysis of the data to (1) assess patient safety, (2) 
determine the parameters of the detection algorithm, (3) select the dose for Phase B and (4) evaluate the device function. These results w ere reported to FDA prior to starting the Phase B part 
of this study . In Phase A, no adverse eve nts related to the investigational product were reported 
(n=15 patients). Lumicell also determined the tumor detection threshold parameters based on 
comparison of imaging data with pathology results. The dose selected for Phase B is 1.0 mg/kg based on Lumi cell’s dose -response model and Phase A data. During Phase B, we will preliminarily 
assess the performance of the detection algorithm  and adjust the threshold parameters if needed.  
Nomenclature:  
Throughout this protocol, reference is made to the orientation of the lumpectomy cavity (tumor 
bed) and the shaved margins specimens. When a lumpectomy is performed, there are typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 6 surfaces defined as if the cavity is a cube. To determine the margin status (either positive or negative), a cavity shaving is tak en from each surface of the tumor bed and analyzed by a 
pathologist. Note that there will be no intraoperative frozen section analysis of the gross resection or shavings during this study because frozen section analysis is not standard of care for breast 
cancer surgeries. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the nomenclature for the 
lumpectomy cavity margins, showing 5 locations. The sixth surface (not shown in the figure) is the “anterior” margin which is the margin nearest to the skin which could blend into one or more of the side surfaces depending on how the initial incision is done. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], a shaved margin specimen is not taken from the posterior surface if the lumpectomy cavity reaches the fascia over the pectoral muscle. Thus, in a given lumpectomy, there will be between [ADDRESS_1080363] by [CONTACT_785420] s urface of each tissue shaving from invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In 
this study, a positive margin is defined as invasive cancer or DCIS present on the inked surface.

Figure 1:  Schematic representation of the surfaces of a lumpectomy cavity (white circle). The 
posterior margin is nearest the fascia. The anterior margin (not shown) is nearest the skin.  
 
For each of the lumpectomy surfaces, we use the naming convention shown in Figure 2 to compare 
imaging versus pathology. For example, consider the lateral location. The surface of the gross 
resection facing the lateral location is called margin 1 (M1). The exposed surface in the lateral 
location of the lumpectomy cavity is called tumor bed 1 (TB1). Once the standard of care cavity shaving specimen is taken, the opposite side of the shaving is called margin 2 (M2). The newly exposed surface in the  lumpectomy cavity is called tumor bed 2 (TB2). We use this naming 
convention throughout this protocol. 
 
 
Figure 2:  Schematic representation of the gross resection  and the cavity shavings. Standard of 
care lumpectomy is depi[INVESTIGATOR_241114] ( lumpectomy specimen  and first cavity shaving). The second 
(yellow) and third (red) cavity shavings are only removed when the LUM Imaging System 
indicates that residual cancer is present (Phase B of the Feasibility study).  
 
The following will be used as the definitions for determining the performance of the LUM imaging system  at the per -tissue level . 
• True positive = fluorescence above normal tissue threshold found in the sample + abnormal tissue found in the sample by [CONTACT_26745]  
• False positive  = fluorescence above normal tissue threshold found in the sample + no 
abnormal tissue found in the sample by [CONTACT_26745]  
• True negative = no fluorescence above normal tissue threshold found in the sample + no abnormal tissue found in the sample by [CONTACT_26745]  
• False negative = no fluorescence above normal tissue threshold found in the sample + abnormal tissue found in the sample by [CONTACT_785421]:

02AUG [ADDRESS_1080364] of 15 evaluable subjects  
• Arm 1: 5 subjects not injected with LUM015  
• Arm 2: 5 subjects injected with 0.5 mg/kg of LUM015 
• Arm 3: 5 subjects injected with 1.0 mg/kg of LUM015 
 
The first group of [ADDRESS_1080365] s was injected with LUM015 at a dose of 
0.5 mg/kg. T he third group of 5 subjects w as injected with LUM015 at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg  to 
assess the ability to distinguish LUM015 fluorescence signal from autofluorescence baseline . The 
objective was to determine the average tumor -to-normal tissue signal ratio (T:N) at both the 0.5 
mg/kg  and 1.0 mg/kg doses. In previous versions of the Investigational Protocol, t he dose that 
generated the highest tumor -to-normal tissue signal ratio w as going to be selected for Phase B. If 
both doses generate d the same T:N, then the lowest dose, namely 0.5 mg/kg, w as going to be 
selected for Phase B . 
 Based on Phase A data, Lumicell developed a dose -response model (see Appendix C)  to predict 
the effects of dose on T:N and signal variations. Based on these results, the dose of 1.0 mg/kg was 
selected for Phase B.  
 
Subjects in Phase B will be injected with a dose of 1.0 mg/kg . Phase B will enroll 10 evaluable 
subjects  with positive margins based on histological margin assessment from  the initial shaved 
margin  (with a maximum enrollment of up to 50 subjects  to achieve 10 subjects with positive 
margins ). 
 The total enrollment of th e Feasibility study  is 25 to 65 subjects  (15 subjects in Phase A and up to 
50 subjects in Phase B) . The endpoints for the Phase A and Phase B of the Feasibility study are 
outlined below.  
Endpoints:   
 Phase A:  
• Select the dose (either 0.5 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg)  for Phase B and pi[INVESTIGATOR_785393] -to-normal tissue signal ratio. 
• Define the parameters for the detection algorithm to be used in the Phase B portion of the 
study . 
• Collect safety data  
Phase B:  
• Evaluate and, if necessary, adjust the detection algorithm parameters  
• Adjust, if necessary, the protocol for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] t rial.

 General Procedure:  (Same for both Phase A and B)  
The first group of 5 subjects  in Phase A will not be injected with LUM015 but will undergo the 
procedure outlined below as if they were injected with LUM015. Because of their exposure to the 
LUM 2.6 Imaging Device, t hese initial 5 subjects will be followed and monitored for safety in the 
same manner as all the patients injected with LUM015 . The second group of 5 subjects (and the 
third group of 5 subjects, if necessary) in Phas e A and all subjects  in Phase B  will be injected with 
LUM015 between 2 to 6 hours prior to surgery at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg , or 1.0 mg/kg. The selection 
of these doses and the timing of injection prior to surgery are based on the results of a n IND  phase 
I study in sarcoma and breast cancer subjects undergoing tumor removal surgery.  A summary of 
the IND phase [ADDRESS_1080366] as 
those patients that undergo imaging with the LUM 2.6 Device. These patie nts will be included in 
the safety cohort  but will not be part of the imaging analysis (efficacy) cohorts. 
 
During histology analysis by [CONTACT_10063], images from the histology slides will be recorded for 
concordance with the fluorescence imaging result s from the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device.  
 
Phase A  Procedures : 
  
1. LUM 2.6 Imaging Device is initialized.  
2. For surgeries with sentinel lymph node resection:  
a. surgeon performs axillary incision  
b. surgeon records 3- [ADDRESS_1080367].  
4. Surgeon removes lumpectomy specimen  (gross resection).  
5. For non- palpable tumors, the lumpectomy specimen is imaged by x -ray at the OR 
suite . The surgeon will remove additional tissue  (which is part considered part of the 
gross resection)  if indicated by [CONTACT_941] x -ray imaging results.  
6. Surgeon records  3-4 images  of normal appearing tissue on the underside of the skin 
flaps  using the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device . These images will be used for evaluation of 
baseline fluores cence of normal tissue.  
7. Surgeon scans the tumor bed cavity (TB1, Figure 2) with the LUM 2.[ADDRESS_1080368] of care at MGH. Final margin assessment is based on pathology analysis 
of this shaved margin specimen. 
9. Surgeon scans the tumor be d cavity (TB2) with the LUM 2.[ADDRESS_1080369] of care surgery continues. 
11. Surgeon or research assistant records images from the 6 faces of the lumpectomy  
specimen ex vivo  using the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device . 
12. Surgeon or research assistant records images of both sides of the shaved margin specimens  (TB and M surfaces)  ex vivo using the LUM 2.[ADDRESS_1080370] inks and then transects  the lumpectomy specimen and records 
an image from the cross section of the specimen.  
The table below shows the data to be collected. Note that TB1 will be imaged twice: once in vivo 
in the lumpectomy cavity and once ex vivo in the shaved margin to account for potential spatial 
differences between the in vivo and ex vivo tissue images.

Final margin assessment will be done by [CONTACT_785422] 
M2 surface  per standard pathology protocols . 
 
Imaging data with their respective histologic assessment for the presence of abnormal tissue were 
used to generate receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves based on Lumicell ’s abnormal 
tissue detection thresholds  described below .  
 From the Phase A imaging data, Lumicell used the metric  of TB1000, which is defined as the 
minimum signal from the brightest contiguous cluster of [ADDRESS_1080371]. The data from Phase A showed relatively small patient -to-patient variations in signal, t hus a fixed, absolute threshold can be used to discriminate 
between tumor and normal tissue images. The fixed threshold is represented as:  
 
Tumor present if TB1000 signal in a given tissue image >  Y 
 
Although our Phase A data shows that a fixed threshold w orks well with the small population 
tested, it is possible that with a larger population we may encounter larger patient- to-patient 
variations. Thus, Lumicell decided to plan for the possibility of needing a threshold that varies proportional to normal tis sue signal. This patient -specific variable threshold is represented as:  
 
Tumor present if TB1000 signal in a given tissue image >  a*subject’s normal tissue signal 
baseline  
 
The normal tissue signal baseline is determined by [CONTACT_70849] [ADDRESS_1080372] value among them.  
 
Lumicell’s software compares the fixed threshold with the patient- specific variable threshold for 
each patient and will select the lower of the two to determine whether tumor is present in the tissue 
until one threshold approach proves to be superior.

 Phase B  Procedures : 
1. LUM 2.6 Imaging Device is initialized.  
2. For surgeries with sentinel lymph node resection:  
a. surgeon performs axillary incision  
b. surgeon records 3- [ADDRESS_1080373].  
4. Surgeon removes lumpectomy specimen  (gross resection).  
5. For non- palpable tumors, the lumpectomy spe cimen is imaged by x -ray at the OR 
suite. The surgeon will remove additional tissue  (which is part considered part of the 
gross resection)  if indicated by [CONTACT_941] x -ray imaging results.  
6. Surgeon records  3-4 images  of normal appearing tissue on the underside of the skin 
flaps  using the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device . The software will use these images to set 
the abnormal tissue detection threshold using the algorithm confirmed during Phase 
A. 
7. Surgeon scans the tumor bed cavity (TB1) with the LUM 2.6 Imaging D evice and 
research assistant records images from every surface and takes note of the quadrants 
identified as containing fluorescence above the abnormal tissue threshold (these regions will be displayed in red in the screen). The surgeon is blinded to the images.  
8. Surge on removes one shaved margin specimen from each tumor bed cavity surface 
per standard of care at MGH. This shaved margin specimen will be analyzed by [CONTACT_785423] a positive margin after standard of 
care treatment.  
9. Research assistant informs the surgeon of the imaging results from step 4.  
10. Surgeon scans the tumor bed cavity (TB2) with the LUM 2.[ADDRESS_1080374] an image from each surface.  
11. Surgeon removes an additional shaved margin specimen from any surface showing residual fluorescence (highlighted in red in the screen). Surgeon will repeat the 
imaging procedure until no residual fluorescence is observed but will not remove 
more than a total of [ADDRESS_1080375] cancer

 13. Surgeon or research assistant records images of both sides of the shaved margin 
specimens  (TB and M surfaces)  ex vivo using the LUM 2.[ADDRESS_1080376] 
pathology findings.  
 Imaging data from gross resection dissection, M1, TB1 and M2 with their respective histologic 
assessment  (when available)  for the presence of abnormal tissue will be used to preliminarily 
evaluate the feasibility of the detection algorithm in identifying residual cancer . In addition, data 
analysis will compare positive margin rates based on the first standard of care shaved cavity margin (M1) and the positive margin rate based on the final, image guided shaved margin. This data will support the endpoints for the subsequent pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397].  
 During Phase B, after every [ADDRESS_1080377] the device 
settings/components will be made.  
 
In some surgeries when the tumor is near the skin, a thin layer of tissue may be left just under the 
skin. Preliminary data shows that high fluorescence from the skin may create artifacts when 
imaging the thin layer of tissue in the lumpectomy cavity. In order to analyze possible  artifacts 
caused by [CONTACT_49230]’s fluorescence, we will perform imaging of the external breast tissue (skin) with 
the LUM Imaging Device  pre and post injection of the LUM015 dye . Our intent is for a physician 
or research assistant to obta in a baseline signal background measurement by [CONTACT_785424]. Images will be taken prior to injection to within [ADDRESS_1080378] imaging will not occur.   
 
Pathology analysis : 
 The purple ink applied during the ex vivo imaging proc edures with the LUM 2.[ADDRESS_1080379] pathology procedures  (see Appendix B for a detailed pathology 
protocol) . The purple ink will be applied to both surfaces of the shaved margin, except on the final 
shaved margin in whic h the purple ink will be applied only to the TB surface . All the resected 
specimens will be inked and processed per standard of care pathology procedures. After all the 
standard of care pathology procedures are completed, the study pathologist will review histopathology of areas marked with purple ink that designate areas of fluorescence identified by [CONTACT_785425] 2.[ADDRESS_1080380] cancer

1.3 Objectives  
 
Primary objective s of the Feasibility Study:  
(1) To determine the dose to be used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076]; (2) to evaluate the detection algorithm for identifying r esidual cancer in the tumor bed; and (3) to gather additional  
safety data of the LUM Imaging System in breast cancer subjects.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 2.[ADDRESS_1080381] consisting of an imaging device 
and an imaging agent (LUM015). 
2.1.1 LUM Imaging Device  
The LUM Imaging Device consists of a computer control unit, monitor and light source mounted in a cart, and a hand- held imaging head (LUM 2.6 imaging head). 
The computer control unit collects, analyzes (based upon Lumicell’s detection 
algorithm) and displays the resulting images gathered by [CONTACT_402107] -
time. The light source provides the illumination to excite the fluorescent dye present in LUM015. Light is transferred from the light source to the imag ing head using an 
optical fiber bundle. The imaging head ( Figure 3) was designed as a lightweight 
hand- held tool with a small profile to allow easy  maneuverability and limited 
intrusiveness into the operating room. The imaging head has a 45° bend at the dist al 
end for examination of the walls of the lumpectomy cavity.  
 The hand- held optical head will be used within the sterile surgical field.  
Consequently, a sterile barrier assembly will be used to cover the optical head, which comes into contact [CONTACT_785426]’s exposed tumor bed. The sterile barrier assembly consists of a pre -assembled 1) sterile, disposable optical 
window made of plastic with a glass insert, which maintains the imaged tissue at the focal plane of the imaging system and 2) sterile, disposable plastic drape (510(k) 
clearance number K964142) . The disposable optical window and drape are installed 
on the LUM Optical Head in the OR following aseptic procedures just prior to the 
imaging procedures.  
  Lumicell’s intraoperative imaging approach consists of several steps: (1) acquire wide field of view image with microscopic resolution; (2) identify abnormal tissue  
using a computational algorithm; and (3) provide feedback to the surgeon by 
[CONTACT_785427] l tissue  in an image (monitor) or indicating 
that the image of the zone does not have a positive indication of cancer tissue . Most 
importantly, all these steps are accomplished in real- time.

imaging head scanning a lumpectomy cavity. The sterile transducer cover over the device is not 
shown. 
 
The LUM 2.6 imaging head is powered by [CONTACT_402109]’s proprietary detection software which processes  the fluorescence images, determines whether any tumor margin cells 
are in the field of view and highlights them.  The software performs corrections for 
camera dark counts and uneven illumination to improve performance across the entire field of view. The software uses images of normal tissue to set the threshold to 
identify normal from abnormal tissue. When the surgeon scans the tumor bed, the detection software compares the intensity of an image against the threshold and 
identifies  whether  a region of the image contains abnormal tissue . Regions with 
signal above the threshold are displayed as highlighted regions on the monitor . Figure 
3 shows an image of actual residual cancer ( Figure 4a and b) along with what the 
surgeon sees ( Figure 4c) in real -time with Lumicell’s algorithm indicating the 
regions with residual cancer to be remove d. The algorithm was developed based upon 
hundreds of tissue images from mice, dogs and humans compared against pathology of the imaged tissue . Based on a typi[INVESTIGATOR_785394] ~6 Mby[CONTACT_785428] a transfer rate 
of 10 Hz, the nominal requirements for the computer are: 2.0 GHz processor, 512 Mby[CONTACT_785429], and operates in a Windows environment. The image acquisition and analysis software is written in C++.

 Lumicell engineered LUM015, a fluorescence -based imaging agent that accumulates 
within the tumor and the tumor invasive front and is activated by [CONTACT_785430]. In its native state, the fluorescence of LUM015 is suppressed by [CONTACT_402106]  
(QSY21) ; however, once cathepsin proteases cleave LUM015 at its amino acid 
backbone, the quencher is released and the fluorescent dye Cy5 in LUM015 emit s 
detectable fluorescence  (Figure 5). The absorption and emission wavelength maxima 
for the fluorescent molecule used, Cy5, are 649 nm and 670 nm respectively. LUM015 employs a fluorescent molecule with excitation and emission in the far 
red spectrum (< 700 nm wavelength) because in that range light can travel effectively through 1mm of tissue and tissue autofluorescence is minimal, allowing higher sensitivity due to lower background [ 2].

upregulated in most human cancers and are also present in tumor associated macrophages at the inv asive front  [3-7]. Platt et. al.  show s 60-fold higher cathepsin 
activity in breast cancer tissue than in healthy breast tissue  [8]. Others report o ver-
expression of cathepsin enzymes (B, K, L and D) in ductal carcinoma in situ as well as in invasive carcinomas (lobular and ductal) [4, 8-11]. Also, cathepsin B is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_139701] -expressed in inflammatory breast cancer, the most lethal form of 
primary breast cancer with a 3 -year survival rate of 40% [ 12, 13]. The peptide 
sequence used in LUM015 is a pan- cathepsin substrate meaning that it will be 
cleaved by m ultiple enzymes of the cathepsin family. Because high activity of 
cathepsin enzymes is f ound in tumor cells and tumor associated macrophages 
surrounding the tumor at the invasive front, these enzymes provide an excellent marker for activating LUM015 at the tumor margin. The fluorescence of LUM015 is then detected with t he LUM Imaging System t o identify cancer and cancer -related 
cells from adjacent normal tissue.  
 Lumicell’s imaging agent application is unique as its properties allow the  detect ion 
of cancer cells at or just below the surface of the exposed tumor bed to be consistent 
with the margin assessment performed by [CONTACT_56618] . For this protocol, positive 
margins are declared when cancer cells are present at  the inked surface . 
The safety of LUM01 5 has been  investigated under IND 111,670, in a  study titled:

 Cancer Specific Probe LUM015.”  The IND Sponsor is David G. Kirsch, MD, PhD, 
Associate Professor of Radiation  Oncology at Duke University School of Medicine 
where the study was being conducted.  The device component of the system was not 
used on subjects in the Phase I study, but was  used to image excised tissue in the 
pathology suite. No clinical  treatment decis ions were made on the basis of this 
imaging  during the Phase 1 study . 
The Phase I study has been completed with fifteen subjects participating in the trial (see Table 2 below for a summary of the study cohorts)  under the IND 111670. No 
adverse pharmacological activity (APA)  or adverse events were observed  in any of 
the subjects . Tissues from these subjects were imaged ex vivo using Lumicell’s 
current device and we determined an average tumor signal to background (normal tissue) signal ratio (TBR) of 5:1  (Table 3 ).

2.1.3 Use of the LUM Imaging System  
 
LUM015 is reconstituted in 0.45% saline at the institution’s pharmacy  prior to the 
injection  and is stable for 4 hours when stored at room temperature or 24 hours 
when stored refrigerated between 2°C and 8°C . Following the instructions for use, 
a calculated amount o f solution volume of LUM015 is obtained based on the dose 
and the patient’s  most recently obtained body weight  and placed in a sterile 
syringe. LUM015 is administered into the patient via slow intra -venous push 2 to 
6 hours prior to the surgery.  
 Prior to starting the surgery, the LUM Imaging Device will be located at the operating room and powering up routines and calibrations will be performed by [CONTACT_785431] (IFU). A sterile imaging tip and drape will be installed ov er the device to provide a barrier between the imaging head and the sterile 
field. During surgery, once the surgeon removes the bulk tumor mass, the surgeon will place the LUM Imaging Head in contact [CONTACT_785432] n to obtain a fluorescence baseline. Then, the surgeon will scan the 
tumor bed cavity. Real -time images are displayed in gray -scale and regions with 
residual fluorescence identified as abnormal tissue by [CONTACT_402109]’s detection algorithm will be highlighted i n red in the screen ( Figure 4). The surgeon will then take 
shavings from the tumor bed cavity regions indicated to contain abnormal tissue.

procedure is required. Rates of close or positive margins have been reported in the range 
between 17 to 59% [ 17-21]. In two separate retrospective reviews of lumpectomies 
performed at the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_628422] 1997 and 2007, we found rates for close or positive margins of 23% [ 22] and 36% [23]. Our review also found that 91% 
of patients with positive margins had re -excision surgeries followed by [CONTACT_785433]. Furthermore, approximately 32% of pat ients having either one or two re -
excisions still had close or positive margins. We estimate that i n the US more than 
150,[ADDRESS_1080390], provides real -
time feedback to the surgeon about the status of the tumor bed, and does not require patient immobilization; hence, the technology does not have a significant  impact on the 
surgical workflow. With this technology, breast cancer surgeons  can make decisions that 
have the potential to prevent repeat surgeries, minimize patient discomfort, and reduce surgical risks.  
 
Lumicell has demonstrated safety and efficacy in  over 100 mice and 21 dogs (currently 
running a clinical trial in canine subjects  at Tufts University Cummings School of 
Veterinary Medicine with [CONTACT_785454]  and the Veterinary Specialty Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785395]. William Eward ).  
 The current pr otocol describes a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the LUM I maging 
System in achieving negative margins in breast cancer subject s. In the initial feasibility 
study,  we will finalize the algorithm used in  the LUM Imaging System to detect residual  
cancer when compared against histology. In subjects from the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688] , we will 
prospectively evaluate the efficacy of the technology to detect residual cancer and reduce 
the rates of post -operative positive margins.

4. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT 
  4.1 General Guidelines  for Screening and Enrollment  
 
The Institution will register eligible participants with the DF/HCC Quality Assurance 
Office for Clinical Trials (QACT) central registration system. Registration must occur prior to the initiation of therapy. Any participant not registered to the protocol before treatment  begins will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied.  
 An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the QACT protocol -specific eligibility checklist.  
 Following registration, participants may begin protocol treatment. Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator. If a participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the participant’s 
protocol status must be changed. Notify the QACT Registrar of participant status changes as soon as possible. 
 
The study team will document subject eligibility on the Screening and Enrollment form and notify Lumicell of a potential candidate for the study after the subject has been consented.  
 The subject is not considered enrolled into the study until written Informed Consent is obtained and the investigational product has been administered (Study Day One).  
 Lumicell will perform an analysis of the data collected in Arms 1 and 2 to determine if  
the acceptance criterion is met  (normal tissue signal is separated by [ADDRESS_1080401] deviations 
from the mean autofluorescence in normal tissue ) and an additional  5 subjects  (Feasibility 
Study Phase A, Arm 3) will be enrolled in the study  if the acceptance cr iterion is not met.  
Lumicell will notify the clinical site when enrollment can restart.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1080402] registration staff is accessible on Monday through Friday, from 8:00 AM to 5:[ADDRESS_1080403] registration line at 617- 632-3761 
and follow the instructions for registering participants after hours.  
 
The enrollment  procedures are as follows:  
 
1. Obtain written informed consent from the subject  prior to the performance of 
any study related procedures or assessments.  
 
2. Complete the QACT protocol -specific eligibility checklist using the eligibility 
assessment documented in the subject ’s medical/research record. To be eligible 
for registration to the study, the subject  must meet each inclusion and 
exclusion criteria listed on the eligibility checklist.  
 
Reminder:  Confirm eligibility for ancillary studies at the same time as eligibility 
for the treatment study. Registration to both treatment and ancillary studies will not be completed if eligibility requirements are not met for all studies.  
 
3. Fax the eligibility che cklist(s) and all pages of the consent form(s) to the QACT 
at 617- 632-2295.  
  Exception:  DF/PCC Affiliate sites must fax the entire signed consent form 
including HIPAA Privacy Authorization and the eligibility checklist to the Network Affiliate Office. The  Network Affiliate Office will register the 
participant with the QACT.  
  
4. The QACT Registrar will (a) validate eligibility, (b) register the participant on the study, and (c) randomize the participant when applicable.  
 
5. The QACT Registrar will send an email confirmation of the registration and/or 
randomization to the person initiating the registration immediately following the registration and/or randomization.  
 
6. Notify Lumicell clinical team of eligible subject status and date of proposed surgery.

5.1 Pre-treatment Criteria  
 
No pre -treatment is required.  
   5.2 Agent Administration  
 
5.2.1 LUM015  
 
• Administration – The intravenous (IV) line through which LUM015 will be injected 
must be flushed with 10- [ADDRESS_1080404] prior to injection of LUM015. 
LUM015 is administered as a slow push rate over 3 minutes in a single dose of 0.5 
mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg via peripheral IV injection in 0.45% saline without glucose  
between 2 to 6 hours prior to surgery. The injection is immediately followed by a 
saline flush of 10- 20 mL . 
• Dosing – LUM015 is provided in amber vials in lyophilized form. Nominally each 
vial contains [ADDRESS_1080405] itution with 1.0  mL of 
0.45% saline  without glucose , the pH of the solution is 6.5. 
• As per IV injection standard of care, all subject s will be observed for signs of 
extravasation , or allergic reaction  following administration of LUM015  to monitor 
for adver se pharmacological activity related to the investigational agent .  All study 
safety assessments will continue until the first post- operative visit (approximately 
2-3 weeks after surgery).   
 
5.2.2 Other Modality(ies) or Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Subjects in Feasibility Phase A : 
The first cohort of patients in Phase A w ere not injected with LUM015 and 
under went  the procedure outlined below as if they were injected with 
LUM015. The second and third cohort s in Phase A w ere injected with 
LUM015 between 2 to 6 hours prior to surgery  at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (n = 
5 subjects) , or 1.0 mg/kg (n = 5 subjects). The selection of t hese doses wa s 
based on the results of a phase I study in sarcoma and breast cancer subjects undergoing tumor removal surgery.  Subjects w ere observed to collect 
safety data of the LUM Imaging System  from the time of injection  of 
LUM015 to the time they were discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The subject s 
had a final safety assessment at the first post -operative visit.  After standard 
of care gross tumor resection, the  surgeon recorded  3-[ADDRESS_1080406] of care 
practices, the surgeon then remove d an additional 5- 10 mm thick strip of 
tissue  (shaved cavity margins)  from the walls of the lumpectomy cavity for 
histologic al margi n assessment.  After the standard of care strip of tissue wa s 
removed, the surgeon recorded  images with the LUM imaging head from 
the newly exposed anterior, posterior, medial, lateral, inferior and superior quadrants of the lumpectomy cavity . All images were labeled according to 
the location from where they were taken in the lumpectomy cavity. An image was recorded from the inked surface of the additional strip of tissue 
removed. Images were also  recorded from the gross resection. Then a  
pathologist assista nt dissect ed a portion of the gross resection and record ed 
an image from the inside of the resection. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subjects in Feasibility Phase B  
Subject s undergoing breast cancer surgery will be injected with LUM015 
between 2 to 6 hours prior to surgery at a dose of  1.0 mg/kg as determined 
from the results of the feasibility study  Phase A . Subjects will be observed 
to assess the safety of LUM015 from the time of injection to the  time they 
are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. After standard of care gross tumor 
resection, the surgeon will record images with the LUM imaging head from 
the anterior, posterior, medial, lateral, inferior and superior surfaces of the 
lumpectomy cavity . These images will be used to determine the threshold 
based on the normal  tissue multiplier. Then the LUM Imaging System 
software compares this threshold against the fixed threshold and selects the  
lowest value as the threshold for that patient . All images will be labeled 
according to the location from where they were taken in the lumpectomy cavity. The surgeon will be blinded to this imaging result to avoid bias towards excision of more than standard amounts of shaved cavity margin tissue, but a technician at the instrument console will record whether the imaged tissue was clas sified as normal or abnormal by [CONTACT_785434].

Medical Center. The primary endpoint of this study was to evaluate the safety of the LUM015 drug component. As a secondary endpoint, the signals from normal and tumor ti ssue were 
measured ex vivo using the LUM Imaging Device component. Twelve (12) sarcoma patients and three (3) breast cancer patients (invasive ductal carcinoma) have been injected with LUM015 with no adverse pharmacological activity reported ( Table 2).  The only noticeable effect in the study 
subjects has been the green discoloration of urine, which resolve d within [ADDRESS_1080419] 3 eligible subjects were dosed at 0.5mg/kg LUM015 and t he second 3 subjects were dosed 
at 1.0mg/kg  LUM015, with both groups injected ~29 hours prior to surgery. Resected tissue was 
imaged with the LUM Imaging Device in the pathology suite . A comp arison of pharmacokinetic 
data from the initial 6 subjects to preclinical mouse studies suggested that a higher tumor:normal signal ratio would be achieved if tissue was imaged 4 -6 hours after injection. The next 3 subjects 
were injected with 1.0mg/kg of L UM015 and followed by 3 subjects injected with 1.5 mg/kg of 
LUM015 and the final cohort of 3 subjects was injected with 0.5mg/kg. These nine subjects were followed by [CONTACT_402120] 6 hours after LUM015 injection (i.e. same day 
injection and surgery).  The Phase I study report will be available by [CONTACT_521803] 2014.  
 Initial pharmacokinetic data from the first 11 study subjects indicates that LUM015 is cleared with a half -life of 3.6 ± 0.6 hours (average ± standard deviation) ( Figure 6).

 10.1 Expected  Adverse Events  (associated with LUM015)  
  
No adverse events related to the administration of LUM015 were observed during the Phase 1 safety study. Prior to the Phase 1 study, LUM015 had not previously been used 
in humans. Our preclinical studies demonstrated that it was  reasonably safe to proceed 
with a P hase 1 study in humans. Preclinical studies in rats showed no LUM015 related 
effects on clinical observations, FOB evaluation, body weights, food consumption, ocular condition, clinical chemistry, hematology and coagulat ion parameters or organ 
weight at doses up to 53- fold higher than in humans. 
 The results from th e repeat dose toxicity study in dogs ( performed by [CONTACT_12134] ) show that 
administration of 0.5 or 10.0 mg/kg of LUM015 intravenously once daily for seven consecutive days (8 total doses) did not cause any observable target organ toxicities. The 
only observable effect  was hypersensitivity in several dogs. Notably, no hypersensitivity 
has been observed in the human patients that participated in the Phase [ADDRESS_1080420] develops a Grade 2 (or greater) hypersensitivity  or allergic  reaction  as defined in CTCEA 4.03,

 If this occurs, enrollment in  the study should be held until a fter consul tation with the 
FDA regarding the event is  completed  and a determination is made  by [CONTACT_181880], 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_785401] .  
10.2 Monitoring of Laboratory Values  
 
A CBC (red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets) and serum chemistry ( alkaline 
phosphatase, total bilirubin, BUN, calcium chloride, glucose, LDH, phosphorous, 
potassium, total protein, SGOT [AST], SGPT [ALT], sodium) tests will be completed at the first post -operative visit during the routine follow up visit. We note that it is not 
standard of care to perform follow up blood tests unless abnormalities were identified 
prior to surgery. The investigator will review the laboratory reports for any abnormal post-operative laboratory valued and will determine if any results are clinically rel evant.

 Any abnormal values that are determined to be clinically significant will constitute 
adverse reactions and will be capture d on the case report form. If a trend is noted of 
clinically significant laboratory findings (i.e. a specific event occurs in m ore than one 
patient), or if any serious adverse event that is possibly, probably or definitely related to LUM015 or the Imaging Device is reported, no additional patients will be recruited until an explanation can be found. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_785402]/or serious adverse event  resulted from LUM015. The FDA 
will be notified of any trends observed in clinically significant laboratory findings.  
 
10.3 Expected  Adverse Device Effects (associated with the LUM Imaging System)  
 To date, the LUM Imaging System has not been studied clinically. Thus, there are no known anticipated adverse device effects.  
 
11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study. The severity of any possible AE observed will 
be classified per the grading established by t he Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.03. 
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute advers e events only 
if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
11.1.2 Serious adverse event (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. Life- threatening means that the person was at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
• Requ ires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at 
least a 24 -hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279340]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before

 the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed ear lier than 
planned).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or  
• Is an important medical ev ent when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the subject  and require medical  or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive tre atment 
in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures  
• elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen  
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]  
11.1.[ADDRESS_1080421]  (ADE)  
 
An adverse device effect (ADE) is an adverse event which is at least possibly 
related to the device.  ADEs are not considered serious adverse events.  
11.1.4 Unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs)  
 
Unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is  any serious adverse effect on health 
or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caus e by [CONTACT_1282], a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in the investigation plan or application, or any 
other unan ticipated serious problem  associated with a de vice that relates to the 
rights, safety or welfare of subjects.  
11.1.5 Expectedness  
 
Adverse events  (AEs) and adverse device effects (ADEs)  can be 'Expected' or 
'Unexpected' .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Expected adverse event  or adverse device effect

 11.8 Monitoring of Adverse Events /Adverse Device Effects  and Period of Observation  
 
All adverse events  and adverse device effects , both serious and non- serious, and deaths 
that are encountered from initiation of study intervention, throughout the study, and 
within [ADDRESS_1080432] to follow -up. The presence and resolution 
of AEs , ADEs, SAE s and UADEs  (with dates) should be documented on the appropriate 
case report form and recorded in the subject ’s medical record to facilitate source data 
verification.  
 For some SAEs /UADEs , the investigator  or designee may follow -up by [CONTACT_756], fax, 
and/or monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE /UADE  report (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], 
consultant report, or autopsy report).  
 Subject s should be instructed to report any serious post -study event(s) that might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study. The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_785407] 
a subject  has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be 
related to the study.   
 Protocol Deviations:  
 
Protocol deviations to ongoing studies are any unapproved changes in the study design 
and/or procedures that are within the Investigator’s control and not in accordance with 
the IRB approved protocol.  The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_785408]. Ad ditionally, the reviewing IRB has  to be 
contact[CONTACT_426] t he Investigator if a Protocol Deviation mig ht either affect the participant’s 
right, safety or well-being, or might significantly affect the completeness, accuracy and 
reliability of the data. The Protocol Deviation form provided by [CONTACT_785437]. 
 
Note:  The Principal Invest igator will summarize any protocol deviations noted during 
the course of the study in a final statement. 
 In the case that the deviation was identified by [CONTACT_737], the Investigator will 
use the Lumicell deviation f orm to summarize and assess the impact of the deviation.  
Similarly, the Lumicell protocol deviation form will be utilized  to communicate a 
deviation that is identified by [CONTACT_785438].   In both cases, the Investigator 
must provide Lumicell with a copy of the form submitted to their IRB or use the 
Lumicell form to document the deviation.  The deviation will be categorized in the 
description section of the form as a Protocol Waiver or Protocol Deviation. 
 
Examples of major Protocol Deviations include, but are not limited to the following:

every 10 subjects complete the study, the safety data and device performance data wi ll 
be evaluated before recruiting the next 10 subjects.  
 
12.3 Monitoring  
 
Lumicell’s  monitoring process will be initiated with the initial visits to the site to assure 
that it meets the qualification requirements and has adequate experience to conduct the 
study protocol. When the site has met all qualification criteria, submitted all initial 
regulatory documentation, and received IRB approval for the study, Lumicell will 
conduct a study initiation visit (either face to face, or via web) in which the site team will receive protocol specific training in addition to a review of all investigator 
responsibilities, and expectations of Lumicell. Throughout the conduct of the study Lumicell will conduct intermittent site visits to assure compliance with the protocol and 
all applicable regulations. During these visits there will be a source data verification of

02AUG [ADDRESS_1080434] 
a study closure visit. This study visit will assure that all site regulatory documentation 
is present and updated; all data queries are resolved; verify the investigator has approved of all study data submitted to Lumicell; and all final disposition instructions from Lumicell have been delivered to the site investigator.  
 Involvement  in this study as a participating investigator implies acceptance of the 
approved protocol, the potential for audits or inspections, including source data 
verification, by  [CONTACT_284384], Lumicell, the institutional review board, or 
their representatives . The purpose of these audits or inspections is to examine study -
related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted and data w ere recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported in accordance with the 
protocol, institutional policy, Good Clinical Practice s (GCP s), and any applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
 
All data will be monitored for timeliness of submission, completeness, accuracy, and 
adherence to protocol requirements. Monitoring will begin at the time of subject  
registration and will continue during protocol performance and completion.

b)  The use of ‘White-Out’ or similar correction fluid is  forbidden. 
c) Handwritten dates are always to be recorded in the sequen ce of the month, day and 
year (mm/dd/yy  or yyyy)  unle ss otherwise specified.  
d) Use of highlighters on records is acceptable so long as the highlighter color does not 
obscure the underlying text if the record is copi[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
e)   Accuracy is required .  Always verify  entries  are correct and consistent with 
other information. 
f)   S ignatures are to be authentic. 
g)  Recorded dates are to be the actual dates in which the activities were recorded.      
Back-dating is forbidden. 
h) If drinks or chemicals are spi[INVESTIGATOR_785409], dry them off to the best of 
your ability, make an imme diate photocopy and make a notation of the event on the 
copy. Retain  the  original  record  except  in  the  event  of  contamination  with  a  
hazardous material. 
i) All forms must be filled out using non-erasable pen and must be legible.  The use of 
blue or black ink is  preferred. 
j)  Errors must be crossed out with a single line, the correction inserted, and the change 
initialed and dated by [CONTACT_785440].  The reason for

tested in a Phase I clinical trial conducted at Duke University Medical Center and the s afety 
assessment will be continued in this study.  
14.1 General Methods  
For categorical variables, summary tabulations of the number and percentage of patients within 
each category (with a category for missing data) of the parameter will be presented.  For continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, median, standard de viation, minimum, and 
maximum values will be presented.   
Each data value for all the included patients will be presented using patient data listings, sorted patient number, unless otherwise specified.  
All data summary tabulations will be presented by [CONTACT_34450] y site and for the overall study 
population, as appropriate. 
14.1.1  Disposition of Subjects  
Demographic and baseline characteristics data will be summarized for all patients. The total number of patients screened, enrolled, completed and reason for termination wi ll 
be summarized.  
 
14.2 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
Feasibility Phase A : The primary objectives for the feasibility trial are: (1) to find a dose 
of LUM015 that generates the highest average T:N , (2) to define the parameters for the 
detection algorithm and (3) to gather safety data.  
 
Feasibility Phase B:  The endpoints for the Feasibility Phase B are: (1) a preliminary 
evaluation of detection algorithm efficacy, and to make adjustments to the detection algorithm if needed, (2) make adjustments to the protocol for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076], and (3) collect safety data.  
 
Subjects undergoing lumpectomies will be injected with LUM015 at 1.0 mg/kg .  The 
surgeon will perform standard of care surgery and then use the imaging system to take additional cavity shavings based on the de tection algorithm output. We will recruit 
subjects until we obtain 10 evaluable subjects with positive margins based on histological assessment from the initial shaved margins. This group will allow for a maximum enrollment of up to 50 evaluable subjects based on an estimated positive margin rate of 20%. We believe that this number of subjects to test the detection algorithm will provide enough clinical data to adjust the parameters of the detection algorithm and move forward with the pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076]. We will generate an ROC to determine the parameters of the 
detection algorithm to be used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076].

 14.3 Populations for Analysis  
Safety evaluations will be based on all patients who enter the study  including the initial 
five (5) patients who do not receive LUM015, and all the patients that receive LUM015. 
Efficacy evaluations will be based on the group of patients that complete the study.  
14.4 Reporting and Exclusions  
In some cases, there may be a margin shaving with a histological assessment but no fluorescence reading, or vice versa.  Two analyses will be performed.  In a “complete cases” analysis, only the shavings providing both measures will be analyzed.  In a parallel “worst case” analysis, the fluorescence results will be assumed to be wrong.  Both 
analyses will be reported, but the formal success criterion will be based on the complete cases analysis.  
 
14.5 Safety Analysis  
Adverse events  and adverse device effects  will be collected, analyzed and tabulated as 
needed. Serious adverse events (SAE) and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) 
will be tabulated separately  and analyzed with respect to their severity . 
15. PUBLICATION PLAN  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_785410] a peer -reviewed 
journal. The results of this study will be made public within [ADDRESS_1080440]  of this agreement need the previous written consent of Lumicell.  
 
Any formal publ ication of the study in  which the input of Lumicell’s  personnel exceeds that 
of conve ntional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by [CONTACT_785441] s taff. Authorship will be determine d by [CONTACT_11402].

 Appendix A : Protocol for preparation of LUM015 for injection  
 
1 Purpose  
The purpose of this protocol is to describe the dose preparation for the LUM015 Imaging Agent.  
2 Materials  
• LUM015 Formulated, stored frozen ( -20°C)  
• Sterile syringe  
• 0.45% Saline  
3 Methods  
1) After reconstitution, LUM015 should be administered to the patient within 4 hour s when 
stored at room temperature or 24 hours when stored refrigerated between 2°C and 8°C . 
2) Obtain the most recent accurate weight of the subject in kg.   
• Note: If weight is measured in lbs, multiply value by 0.[ZIP_CODE] to obtain kg.  
Example: 155lbs=(155*.[ZIP_CODE])kg=70.306kg 
3) Calculate total dose for subje ct according to protocol. 
• Example: If dose level is 1.0 mg/kg and weight is 70kg, then dose = 1.0*70=70 mg.  
4) Obtain the required number of vials  to administer the full dose .  Each vial contains 10mg 
LUM015.   
• Example: If 70mg is the required dose, 70/10=7 v ials. 
• Example 2: If the dose level is 1.0 mg/kg and the patient weight is 63 kg, the 
required number of vial for the dose of 63 mg is 63/10 = 6.3; thus 7 vials would be 
needed for this patient. 
5) Allow bottles to acclimate to room temperature.  
6) Using aseptic techniques:  
a) Remove protective cap from vial.  See Figures 1 and 2 below. 
b) Draw 1mL of 0.45% saline into a sterile syringe.  
c) Puncture vial with syringe. 
d) Invert syringe and vial such that vial is located vertically up and syringe is closer 
to the floor. 
e) Draw 1mL of air from the vial into the syringe.  
f) Invert syringe and vial such that vial is located vertically down closer to the floor. 
g) Ensure air in syringe is located at the top, away from the floor. 
h) Push 1mL of fluid into the vial. 
i) Compound will dissolve inst antaneously.  
j) Repeat steps a- i with remaining required vials.  
k) Remove fluid from each vial using one large syringe to combine all required fluid.  Ensure that only the required fluid is obtained as the final concentration is

 10mg/mL.  Example: if 35mg is th e required dose, remove only 35/10=3.5mL total 
fluid from all 4 vials.   
7) Prep the injection site for the subject according to standard procedures.  
8) Ensure the vial is homogeneous in blue color (see Figure 3 below) and that there are no air 
bubbles in the sy ringe.  
9) The IV line must be flushed with 10- [ADDRESS_1080442] prior to injection of LUM015 
and the injection is immediately followed by a saline flush of 10- 20 mL . 
10) Inject slow bolus into the subject (over three minutes). 
11) Discard remaining solution and syringes.  
12) Record subject weight, dose, compound lot number, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_785411].  
 
 
4 Caution 
• Ensure there are no air bubbles in the syringe prior to injection.  
• Ensure there are no solid particles visible on the side walls of the syringe barrel prior to injection.  
• Do not use compound if the date has exceeded the expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].  
• Exposure to direct light for more than [ADDRESS_1080443] solution if solid particles are visible 
on side walls of the syringe barrel.

with the purple inked tissue in A3 and A4."  
 
• The tissue is submersed in 10% neutrally buffered formalin and fixed for several hours be fore routine processing and transfer into paraffin blocks. Sections of 5 
μm thickness are cut by [CONTACT_785446], automatically stained with hematoxylin and eosin and coverslipped.  
 
• The H&E stained glass slides are microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_785414]. Occasionally, additional sections or special stains have to be done to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. The final diagnosis is reported and immediately available in the electronic medical record. Ancillary studies (for breast cancer: estrogen and

 Appendix  C: Selection of 1.0 mg/kg dose for Phase B  
1. Clinical data suggests linear dependency between signal and dose  
During Phase A of the Feasibility Study in breast cancer, Lumicell measured the fluorescence 
signal of tumor and normal tissue in transections of the main lumpectomy guided by a pathologist. The measurements were done in 3 patients at 0 mg/kg (no dose) to determine the autofluorescence signal, and in 5 and 4 patients dosed at 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively. Results show that signals from tumor and normal tissue increase linearly with dose ( Figure 7 ). 
 
Figure 7: Data from breast cancer patients in Phase A suggest that signal increases linearly with dose for both 
tumor and normal tissue. Data points show the mean tumor and n ormal tissue signal at each dose (n=3 at 0 
mg/kg, n=5 at 0.5 mg/kg and n=4 at 1.0 mg/kg). Error bars indicate the standard deviation from the mean. Lines 
indicate a linear fit with the goodness of fit represented by R2. 
1.1 Data suggests decreasing tumor -to-normal tissue signal ratio as dose decreases  
We determined the tumor -to-normal tissue signal ratio (T:N, in the Appendix) from the 
lumpectomy transections and observed that T:N appears to decrease with dose ( Figure 8). Based 
on the observation of linear dependency of signal with dose ( Figure 7) and the decrease of T:N 
with dose, we hypothesize that at 0 mg/kg (no LUM015) T:N corresponds to the contrast from 
autofluorescence signals between tumor and normal tissue (~2.1). As dose increases, the signal from tumor and normal tissue overcomes autofluorescence signal and T:N approaches the contrast obtained by [CONTACT_785449]015 in tumor. We used this hypothesis to build a simple model to predict the be havior of T:N with dose as described in 
the following section. 
 
Figure 8: Clinical data from Phase A patients (n=11) suggests that T:N decreases with dose. Each data point 
represents the mean T:N from one patient.  

Feasibility study of intraoperative imaging in breast cancer  
02AUG [ADDRESS_1080447] of dose on T:N. The model is 
based upon the following:  
a. A constant background (autofluorescence) from tumor and normal tissue  
b. A fluorescence signal for tumor and normal tissue that increases linearly with dose in our dose range.  
The model for predicting the mean T:N of a population as a function of dose is given by:  
[INVESTIGATOR_8850] 1 𝑻𝑻:𝑵𝑵𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎𝒎 =𝑫𝑫×𝑩𝑩𝑻𝑻+𝑨𝑨𝑻𝑻
𝑫𝑫×𝑩𝑩𝑵𝑵+𝑨𝑨𝑵𝑵  
where D is dose (in mg/kg), B T is tumor signal increment per unit dose, A T is tumor background 
(autofluorescence) signal, B N is normal tissue signal increment per unit dose, and A N is normal 
tissue background (autofluorescence) signal.  
Using the T:N data in Figure 8, we performed a least -squares fit to our model ( Equation 1). 
Results show that our model fits the data ( Figure 9 ). The model predicts that at doses above 1.0 
mg/kg, T:N is essentially constant suggesting that higher doses do not improve performance.  
 
Figure 9: T:N data from Phase A patients (n=11) fit Lumicell’s dose -response model (equation 1). Blue 
dotted lines are plotted to help the  reader to note lower expected T:N at 0.5 mg/kg than at 1.0 mg/kg.  
3. T:N does not give the  whole story: signal variation will dominate at lower doses  
Imaging presents unique challenges due to signal variations across the field of view that are not reflected  in the dose -response curve for T:N. Our data show that as dose decreases, the 
coefficient of variation of tumor and normal tissue signal increases  (Figure 10 , see Ap pendix 
for definition of coefficient of variation). The large variations in signal result in overlap between tumor and normal tissue signal histograms leading to false positives and false negatives, as observed at 0 mg/kg dose in Phase A.

Figure 10: The average coefficient of variation for tumor and normal tissue increases with dose. Data points represent the 
average coefficient of variation of n=3 patients at 0 mg/kg, n=5 patients at 0.5 mg/kg and n=4 patients at 1.0 mg/kg. The 
top and bottom error bars indicate the maximum and minimum values of coefficient of variation, respectively.  
As mentioned in the conference call, Lumicell is keenly aware that T:N is only a surrogate for 
the metrics of false positives and false negatives, w hich are strongly affected by [CONTACT_785450]. These metrics require a larger patient population than a dose response curve of T:N would. To comprehend these effects we have characterized the dependence of variance on dose in the following section, leading to our dose selection for Phase B.  
3.1 Model predicts sharp increase of signal variation at doses b elow 0.5 mg/kg  
We used the data from Figure [ADDRESS_1080448] deviation of signal increases linearly with dose (see Appendix for 
data supporting this assumption). The model for coefficient of variation as a function of dose is shown below:  
Equation 2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖(𝐷𝐷)=𝐶𝐶1,𝑖𝑖×𝐷𝐷+𝐶𝐶2,𝑖𝑖
𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖×𝐷𝐷+𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 
where D is dose (in mg/kg), i  represents either tumor ( T) or normal tissue ( N), and A i and B i are 
the fitted parameters from Equation 1. At low doses, CV i is dominated by a constant standard 
deviation independent of dose (represented by C 2,1.) and the autofluorescence signal ( Ai), also 
independent of dose. At higher doses, CV i is dominated by [CONTACT_785451]015 in tissue, until it levels off at C 1,i/Bi. The tumor and 
normal tissue data were used to fit for the model parameters C 1,i and C 2,i. Our simple model 
prediction fits our data well in the dose and signal ranges tested as shown in Figure 11.

Figure 11: Our coeffici ent of variation model fits well to the data in Figure 10 and show a sharp increase in 
coefficient of variation below 0.5 mg/kg. Blue dotted lines are plotted to guide the reader to identify the 
“near optimal” dose of 1.0 mg/kg based upon the coefficient of variation in normal tissue.  
The model in Figure 11 shows a sharp increase in coefficient of variation below a dose of 0.5 
mg/kg. This important and critical behavior for selecting a dose is not captured by [CONTACT_785452] T:N. The signal variations observed with auto fluorescence are as large as the signal 
itself, making the endogenous contrast poor.  
Using Figure 11, we estimat e that the “near optimal” dose (based upon the coefficient of 
variation in normal tissue) is 1.0 mg/kg.  
4. Dose selection rationale and plan for Phase B  
Figure 9 shows t he dose -response (T:N) curve falling off below a dose of 0.75 mg/kg and Figure 
11 shows the rapid increase in coefficient of variation below 0.5 mg/kg. The combined 
deterioration of these two metrics below 1.0 mg/kg clearly points to 1.0 mg/kg as the near 
optimal dose. Selecting a dose lower than 1.0 mg/kg increases the chances of finding false 
negatives and false positives. 
Based on the data and rationale presented abo ve, Lumicell proposes to conduct Phase B of the 
feasibility study at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg and not to test additional doses in Phase A.  
5. Future research  
The data from Phase B will be used to design a randomized, multi -center pi[INVESTIGATOR_785416]

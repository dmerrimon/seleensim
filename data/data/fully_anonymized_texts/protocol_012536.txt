2 J12127 Version: November 14, [ADDRESS_181560] -Revised for delayed 
recall (HVLT -R-delayed recall) at [ADDRESS_181561] of care for treatment of limited stage small cell lung cancer consists 
of chemotherapy plus thoracic irradiation (1), followed by [CONTACT_156777] 
(PCI).  The recommendation for PCI is based on the results of a meta -analysis in patients 
with limited stage small cell lung cancer which demonstrated a 5.4% increase in overall 
survival with the addition of PCI to chemo -radiation therapy for the primary lung tumor  
(2).    
  
Unfortunately, it is well documented that whole bra in radiation therapy is associated with 
neurocognitive toxicity (3 -7) and that there is a direct relationship between 
neurocognitive dysnfunction and worsening quality of life (8).  This toxicity is 
particularly important in patients being treated with PCI  for SCLC since they represent a 
potentially curable patient population who have a relatively high likelihood of surviving 
long enough to develop the long -term sequalae of therapy.   
3 J12127 Version: November 14, [ADDRESS_181562] 
shown that new neurons and glia are produced throughout adult  life from neural stem cell 
precursors in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of 
the hippocampal dentate gyrus (9 -11).  These cells play an important role in injury repair 
within the central nervous system (12,13).  S imilarly, these cells migrate to the site of 
inflammation caused by [CONTACT_156778] (13).  
  
Multiple animal studies have shown that neural progenitor cells are extremely sensitive to 
radiation (14 -17).  Tada et al. showed that 2 Gy of radiatio n effectively killed 
proliferating cells in both the SVZ of the lateral ventricles (14) and the subgranular zone 
of the dentate gyrus (15). The anti -proliferative effects last for up to 15 months after a 
single radiation treatment (18) and are dose depende nt (19,20). There is repair over time 
following low doses of radiation, suggesting likely recovery of cells with fractionation 
(14).    
  
There is an association between radiation -induced neural progenitor cell impairment and 
neurocognitive decline after c entral nervous system irradiation in rodents.  Cranial 
irradiation significantly decreases hippocampal neurogenesis and is associated with 
impaired performance of hippocampal -dependent tasks [ADDRESS_181563] in the human brain as well.  For example, Eriksson et al. (23) demonstrated 
that progenitor cells in the human dentate gyrus divide to form new neurons, while Sanai 
et al. (24) found that astrocytes in the human SVZ of the lateral ventricles divide in vivo 
and act as multipotent progenitor cells in vitro.  Human studi es have likewise 
demonstrated cognitive deficits following cranial irradiation, most notably in children 
(25-28).  This decline includes diminished capability to learn and memorize new tasks 
and information, as well as a dramatic reduction in full -scale IQ  (29).   
  
Recent human studies have demonstrated that it is possible to use intensity modulated 
radiation therapy (IMRT) to reduce the radiation dose to the hippocampus during 
radiation therapy for brain tumors (30 -32).  In addition, preliminary data usin g a mouse 
model has suggested that NPC sparing radiation may allow improved survival of neural 
progenitor cells compared to conventional radiation treatment plans, at least at an early 
time point (33).  Similarly, recent data from a prospective study in ch ildren treated with 
radiation therapy to the brain suggests an inverse relationship between radiation dose to 
the hippocampus and performance on neurocognitive testing (34), and a randomized trial 
comparing 25 Gy versus 36 Gy of PCI found that the risk of chronic neurotoxicity was 
significantly higher in the 36 Gy arm (35).  
  
4 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013  The purpose of this study is to evaluate performance on neurocognitive testing following 
hippocampal -sparing PCI relative to the historical experience of patients (RTOG 0212) 
who rece ived standard PCI.

in a multi -institutional phase III study by [CONTACT_156779] 
(RTOG) in the contex t of brain metastases (36,37).  The tests will be performed by a 
trained examiner.  The tests utilized in this protocol are described briefly below:  
    
2.2.1 Mini Mental State Examination  
          
The Mini Mental State Examination (38) is designed to e valuate global 
function.  It consists of six tasks designed to evaluate short -term memory 
retention and recall, attention, and language.  The maximum score is 30.  
Scores fall into 4 categories:  
  
● 24-30: “Normal” range   
● 20-23: Mild cognitive impairment  
● 10-19: Moderate cognitive impairment  
● 0-9: Severe cognitive impairment  
  
      2.2.[ADDRESS_181565] B is designed to evaluate executiv e function 
(39,40).  These tests require patients to connect circles in numerical (part A) 
or alternating numerical and alphabetical sequence (part B) within a timed 
interval of less than [ADDRESS_181566].  Results are reported as the 
number of seco nds required to complete the task with higher scores reflecting 
higher degrees of impairment.  
  
  Average  Deficient  Rule of Thumb  
Trail A  29 seconds  >[ADDRESS_181567] in 90 seconds  
Trail B  75 seconds  >[ADDRESS_181568] (COWAT) is designed to evaluate 
letter -cued verbal fluency.  It requires patients to name [CONTACT_156786] 
a specific letter with increasing associated activity, i n three 1minute periods.  
5 J12127 Version: November 14, [ADDRESS_181569], low average, borderline, deficient, or seriously deficient, based on t heir 
scores after these adjustments (41).    
  
      2.2.[ADDRESS_181570] of 12 items for three consecutive tests  
(recall), to identify the same [ADDRESS_181571] of semantically related or 
unrelated items (recognition), and to recall the same 12 items after a 15minute 
delay (delayed recall).  Scoring and interpretation are simple, and outlined in a 
professional man ual (42).  
  
      2.2.5 EORTC Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ -C30) and the 
Brain Cancer Module 20  
  
 The EORTC Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ -C30, Appendix B) is a 30 
item questionnaire designed for and validated in cancer patients.  It consists o f 
9 multi -item scales —1 global scale, 5 functional scales (physical, role, 
emotional, cognitive and social), 3 symptom scales (nausea, pain, fatigue).  
The remaining [ADDRESS_181572].  The Brain Ca ncer Module 20 (BN 20, Appendix C) is a [ADDRESS_181573] -Revised is designed to evaluate 
nonverbal/visuospatial lear ning and memory. It serves as a non -verbal 
analogue to the HVLT -R, and is generally more sensitive to right 
hippocampal functioning. It requires patients to learn a series of six figures 
printed on a page over the course of three exposure trials (immediate  recall), 
recall those same six figures after a 15 -20 minute delay (delayed recall), and 
identify the figures from among an equal number of foils (recognition). 
Scoring and interpretation are simple, and outlined in a professional manual 
(43).  
  
6 J12127 Version: November 14, [ADDRESS_181574] is designed to evaluate semantically -guided verbal 
generativity and is often administered in conjunction with the COWAT. It 
requires patients to name [CONTACT_156787] i n 
2 60-second trials. Scoring involves tallying the number of acceptable words 
reported for the two trials and interpretation is simple and outlined in a 
professional manual (44).  
  
2.3.[ADDRESS_181575] of Attention is designed to  evaluate auditory divided attention 
and can be used with individuals with visual and motor impairments that 
preclude tests requiring visual scanning or manual dexterity. It requires 
patients to count numbers or letters from lists read aloud consisting of both 
types of stimuli. The number of correctly monitored lists is tallied, with raw 
scores ranging from 0 to 20. Interpretation is simple and outlined in a 
professional manual (45).  
  
2.3.[ADDRESS_181576]. 
It requires patients read aloud a series of 35 printed, phonetically irregular 
words. The number of correctly pronounced words is tallied and entered into 
a formula along with demographic characteristics to estimate  WAIS -III Full 
Scale IQ [ (86.664 + 0.145(age) − 6.136(sex) − 8.642(race) + 0.564(educ)  +  
0.862 + 1.140(HART), when age is coded in years; sex is coded 1 (male) or 2 
(female); race is coded 1 (non -black) or 2 (black); education is coded in years 
as the hig hest grade completed] (46).   
  
2.3.[ADDRESS_181577] is designed to evaluate mental processing 
speed. It requires patients make speeded same/different distinctions in 
response to pairs of letter strings and pairs  of patterns over the course of two 
90-second trials. Scoring involves tallying the number of correct responses 
across the two trials, with higher scores reflecting faster processing speed 
(47).

 8.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
  
 8.1   Study Design/Endpoints  
    
      8.1.1   Study Design   
This is a single -arm phase II prospective study of patients with limited stage  
SCLC to evaluate neurocognitive outcomes following hippocampal -sparing 
PCI (25 Gy in 10 fractions) relative to a historical control receiving standa rd 
PCI (RTOG 0212 arm receiving 25 Gy in 10 fractions).  
16 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013    
8.1.2 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this study is cognitive function, specifically 
memory, six months from the completion of PCI as measured by [CONTACT_156781] -
delayed recall.    
  
8.1.3 Secondary Endpoints  
  
 [IP_ADDRESS]    Cognitive function, specifically memory, at 12 months from PCI as   
          measured by [CONTACT_156782] -R delayed recall  
  
[IP_ADDRESS]           A composite cognitive function endpoint using the validated               
Reliable Cha nge Index (48,49) to include the Controlled Word    
Association Test (COWAT), the HVLT -R-delayed recall, the   
HVLT -R-trials 1 -3 and Trail Making Tests part A and B (TMT)  
            
[IP_ADDRESS]           Quality of Life (QOL) as measured using the EORTC Quali ty of   
          Life Questionnaire (QLQ -C30) and Brain Cancer Module 20              
(BN20) at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months  
    
[IP_ADDRESS]           Development of brain metastases at 2 years following completion   
of radiation therapy will be coded as a binary variable (yes or no)  
  
           [IP_ADDRESS]   Development of 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis at 2 years following completion of

[IP_ADDRESS]         Overall survival  
  
 8.2   Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
  
      8.2.[ADDRESS_181598] deviation are based on the 
RTOG study and the work of Meyers et al.  The la tter reported a mean score in 
the HVLT -R delayed recall change in patients treated only with whole -brain 
radiation therapy of 0.87 (from 7.04 at baseline to 6.17 at 6 months), with a 
standard deviation of 3.19.  In RTOG 0212, the average decline in HVLT 
memory at six months is 1.13 (sd=2.80).  We expect patients receiving 
hippocampal -sparing PCI to experience a smaller decline in cognitive function 
from baseline to six months, compared to the historical control group. The 
17 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013  onesided statistical hypothesis tes t is as follows: H0: Δμ = 1 vs. HA: Δμ < 1, 
where Δμ  is the mean change in HVLT scores from baseline to 6 months for 
patients receiving hippocampal -sparing PCI (baseline minus 6 -month score). 
With change measured in [ADDRESS_181599] 90% power to detect a 
meaningful change (0.88 points less change in HVLT scores over 6 months,  
i.e., mean change of 0.12) in our treated group with a one -sided test at the 5% 
level of significance, assuming a standard deviation of around 3.  Similarly, we 
will have 80% power with a one -sided 5% level test to detect a mean change of 
0.75 (with standard deviation equal to 3).  We will enroll 125 patients to a llow 
for up to 20% of patients to be not evaluable at [ADDRESS_181600] of 12 words.  Therefore, if a patien t initially is able to recall 8 
words pre -therapy and is, at 6 months, able to only recall 6 words, their change in 
score would be 2. The primary endpoint (change score) is the difference between the 
pre-therapy and post -therapy scores. A change score of z ero indicates preserved 
cognitive function.   Change scores from -[ADDRESS_181601] deviations, and ranges will be listed separate ly by [CONTACT_3148] 
(sparing PCI and historical standard PCI groups). We hypothesize that change scores 
from pre -therapy to [ADDRESS_181602] the change in HVLT -R scores 
over six months, relative to the expectation based on the historical information, 
according to the statistical hypotheses given in the sample size section (Section 
8.2.1).  
  
18 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013  The analysis of the secondary outcome of HVLT -R-delay score change at 12 months 
will be performed as described above for the primary outcome.  In addition, we will 
examine if there appears to be a trend to increasing change score over time for the 
treatmen t groups.   
  
The Reliable Change Index will measure meaningful change between baseline and 6 
and 12 months for HVLT –R, Trail Making Test part A and B, COWAT.  The 
Reliable Change Index is derived from the standard error of measurement (SEM) for 
each test in the battery. The SEM is calculated from the test –retest reliability (r) and 
the standard deviation of test scores (SD): SEM=sqrt[SD×(1 -r)].  The standard error 
of the difference (SEdiff ) is then calculated as SEdiff =sqrt[2×(SEM)2].  For each 
test in t he neurocognitve battery, the Reliable Change Index value will be determined 
a priori  for that particular test to determine whether a change from baseline is 
clinically meaningful.    
  
We will compute summary statistics and compare our patients to the his torical 
controls based on tests that are appropriate for the type of data.  
  
Quality of Life on our study will be assessed using EORTC Quality of Life 
questionnaire (QLQ -C30) and the Brain Cancer Module 20 (BN 20) pre -therapy, at [ADDRESS_181603] follow up date. Overall survival probabilities will be 
estimated via the Kaplan -Meier method; median survival and 95% confidence 
interval via Greenwood’s formula for variance will be reported.   
  
8.[ADDRESS_181604] included a formal statistical stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_156770].  The article describing RTOG 0212 reported that the raw proportion 
of patients with brain metastases is 22% (29/131) at 1 year for the group g etting 2.5 
Gy in 10 fractions.  We established a monitoring rule that will recommend 
considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_156771] 1 year is above 22%.  Specifically, if the posterior probabilit y that 
the risk exceeds 25% of brain metastasis by 1 year after treatment is 75% or greater 
(3:1 odds), then we will consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098].  In this calculation, the number 
of patients with brain metastasis at 1 year is a binomial random variable.  T he prior 
19 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013  distribution for the risk of brain metastasis by 1 year is beta with parameters 29 & 
102.  Although we can apply the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_156772], we may 
monitor in batches of 10.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_156773].  
  
  
 9.  ADVERSE EVENTS AND RECORDING   
  
9.1 Definition of Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the 
deterioration of a pre -existing medical condition during or following an exposure to a 
treatment, whether or not considered causally related to the treatment.  An 
undesirable medical condition may be symptoms (headache, nausea), signs  
(tachycardia, enlarged liver), or abnormal results of an investigation (MRI, laboratory 
finding).  In clinical trials, from the time of signing an informed consent, an AE may 
include an undesirable medical condition, occurring at any time, even if no trial 
treatment has been administered.   
  
    9.2  Radiation Related Adverse Events    
  
All radiation related adverse events will be recorded on the local toxicity case report 
forms.  
   

20 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013      
10. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) AND REPORTING  
  
      10.1  Serious Adverse Event  
  
10.1.1  Definition of Ser ious Adverse Event  
  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring at any point during a clinical trial that 
fulfills one or more of the following criteria:  
  
● Results in death.  
● Is immediately life threatening.  
● Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
● Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
● Unexpected event that cause harm or place person at a greater risk of harm 
than was previously known or recognized, and which was possibly r elated to 
the research.  Unexpected means that the event was not described in the 
consent form or the event exceeded the expected severity.  
● Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed above.  
  
     10.[ADDRESS_181605] (JH -IRB) within 10 working days of the principa l 
investigator learning of the event.  Reporting for the death of a patient which was 
unexpected (i.e.: not related to a risk of participation that was listed in the protocol or 
the consent document, and was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_39292] h 
procedure/intervention, must be reported to the JH -IRB within 3 working days of 
when the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54915].  Reporting for death 
of a participant that was e xpected due to the nature of the patient’s underlying diseas e 
or condition, or identified as caused by a possible risk of the study 
procedure/intervention as described in this protocol or consent form, must be reported 
to the JH -IRB within [ADDRESS_181606] to report the death until 
the time of continuing review.    
  
11.    DATA AND SAFETY REPORTING/ REGULATORY CONSIDERATI ONS  
  
   11.1   Data Quality Monitoring  
  
This is a DSMP Level I study under the SKCCC Data Safety Monitoring Plan 
(09/22/2011). The Clinical Research Office QA Group will perform an audit at the 
21 J12127 Version: November 14, [ADDRESS_181607], and the study coordinator to assess the data quality.  This meeting 
will occur annually and a monitor ing report of the findings will be submitted to the 
Data Safety Monitoring Committee on an annual basis.  Any protocol deviations or 
violations will be documented in the monitoring reports.  The review will include: 
consent forms, eligibility criteria, pro tocol compliance, treatment administration, 
toxicity reports, response, regulatory compliance, case report forms (completeness as 
well as verifying that information coded on the case report forms are supported by 
[CONTACT_18412]), and all other materials related to the trial.  In addition, this trial 
will be audited annually by [CONTACT_156783].    
  
   11.2   Data Safety Monitoring  
  
All SAE’s and major protocol deviations that occur at Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_156774].  In addition, the overall study 
safety and potential activation of the study’s early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_156775] o f every SAE.  The Data Safety Monitoring Committee with review this trial 
for safety annually.   
  
 11.3  Data Reporting  
  
 11.3.1  Method   
  
Data will be collected on Case Report Forms (CRF’s). These CRF’s will be 
completed by [CONTACT_408]. The CRF’s for each subject will be kept 
in a separate research binder. Along with each completed CRF there will be 
corresponding source documentati on filed for verification. The Principal 
Investigator, Research Nurse, and Study Coordinator will informally meet on 
a regular basis to make sure that the trial is progressing as mandated by [CONTACT_12695]. The Clinical Research Office (CRO) will audit this trial per their 
standards to ensure and verify that the protocol is being carried out according 
to plan as well as to verify tha t data included on subject CRF’s are accurate. 
Exit reports generated as a result of these CRO audits will be forwarded to 
both the Safety Monitoring Committee as well as to the IRB of record for 
review.

L1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab. The primary objectives in the study will be to estimate the 
safety and immune response to pembrolizumab given either sequentially or concurrently with CRT. 
Secondary objective s will evaluate the metabolic response and rates of distant metastases following 
treatment with pembrolizumab given sequentially or concurrently with CRT. The study design also 
affords the opportunity to characterize the effect of treatment on immune response pathways by 
[CONTACT_440539]. 
At baseline, subjects will undergo a full medical history and physical examination, vital signs, 
performance status, and general laboratory evaluations. Baseline imaging assessments will include 
PET/CT and MRI (MRI is required, unless there are contraindications or at the discretion of the 
investigator) . Eligible subjects (n=88) will be randomized 1:1 to two treatment sequences to receive 
pembrolizumab after completion of CRT (Arm 1) or to receive pembrolizumab concurrent to CRT 
(Arm 2). Subjects in both arms will receive identical regimen, as follows:  
 Chemotherapy: Weekly Cisplatin (40 mg/m2) for 5 or 6 weeks  
 Radiation: Standard dose IMRT with 4-6 fractions of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy 
using standard doses and methods 
 Pembrolizumab: 200 mg, 3 cycles (every 21 days) 
Subjects will be evaluated for safety by [CONTACT_174801]. All subjects will have a

 4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONA LE 
4.[ADDRESS_558648] common cancer among women worldwide, with an estimated 
528,000 new cases and 266,000 deaths in 2012.[ 1] The standard of care (SOC) for patients with 
locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) is concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) with weekly 
cisplatin.[ 2] Five-year disease OS after contemporary CRT for Stages IB-IVA cervical cancer is only 
66%.[ 2] 
Human Papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) DNA is detected in virtually all cervical cancers, and HPV specific CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells are found in cervical tumors.[ 3] The failure of the immune system to eradicate HPV 
DNA integration is due to cancer cells’ acquisition of cytotoxic T cells, including down-regulation of 
HLA class I, down-regulation of MHC class I chain-related molecule A (MICA), production of immune-
suppressive cytokines, and induction of FoxP3+ immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.[ 4] Low ratios 
of CD8+ T cells: regulatory T cells (Tregs) are associated with poorer survival for cervical cancer 
patients,[ 4] suggesting that strategies to enhance immune response would be effective. 
Compelling evidence indicates that B7 molecules (i.e., B7-1/CD80, B7-2/CD86, B7-H1/PDL1, B7-
H2/LICOS, B7-DC, B7-H3 and B7-H4) and their ligands (i.e., CTLA-4, CD28, PD-1, ICOS) not only 
provide crucial positive signals to stimulate and support T-cell activation, but also offer negative 
signals that control and suppress potentially protective T-cell responses against spontaneously 
arising and virally-induced human tumors.[ 5] Expression of these molecules on the surface of cervical 
tumor cells, tumor associated macrophages, and/or dendritic cells (DC), may attenuate or abrogate 
the ability of the immune system to eliminate strongly antigenic (i.e., virus-infected) tumors such as 
cervical cancer.[ 5] Because these negative signals in human solid tumors have been shown to be 
largely provided by [CONTACT_61896], blockade of PD- 1/PD-L1 co-inhibitory pathways by [CONTACT_440540]-specific immunity in cervical cancer patients. 
PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on cervical T cells and DCs, respectively, has been recently reported to 
be associated with high risk-HPV positivity and to be increased in parallel with increasing CIN 
grade.[ 6] Increased expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 correlates with impaired cell-mediated immunity in 
high-risk HPV related CIN.[ 7] Finally, in cervical cancer, PD-[ADDRESS_558649] therapeutic potential.[ 7] Taken 
together, this evidence validates the importance of the PD-1- PD-L1 pathway for the treatment of 
patients harboring virally-infected tumors such as cervical cancer. 
4.2 Pembrolizumab 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)/approved labeling for detailed background information on 
pembrolizumab. 
 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformatio n 
has been known for decades. Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies. In particular, 
Product:   Pembrolizumab  12 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, 06 March 2018   
 
 the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells 
seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long-term survival in many solid tumors. 
The PD-[ADDRESS_558650] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207].  The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-cells under healthy 
conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune 
reactions.  PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and 
CTLA-4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of 
its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L2).  The structure of murine PD-1 has been resolved.  PD-1 and family 
members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable-type (V-type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling 
molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch 
motif (ITSM). Following T-cell stimulation, PD-[ADDRESS_558651] from that of 
CTLA-4 as both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971]. PD-1 was shown to be 
expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, T regs and 
Natural Killer cells.  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8- 
(double negative) T-cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells. The ligands for PD- 1 
(PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including 
non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors. Both ligands are type I transmembrane 
receptors containing both IgV- and IgC-like domains in the extracellular region and contain short 
cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs. Binding of either PD-[ADDRESS_558652] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only 
detectably expressed on antigen-presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory 
environments.  PD-L2 is thought to control immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-
L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral tissues. Although healthy organs 
express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of 
this T-cell inhibitor. PD-1 has been suggested to regulate tumor-specific T-cell expansion in subjects 
with melanoma (MEL). This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor 
immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 
and PD-L2. KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in the United Stated for the 
treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.

Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_558653] Population  
We hypothesize that CRT in LACC will be beneficial to the immunostimulatory activity of 
pembrolizumab compared to single agent use. This hypothesis is based on evidence that platinum-
based DNA intercalators and irradiation are highly effective at inducing a form of apoptosis known as 
immunological cell death (ICD),[ 8] which can lead to auto-vaccination that is promoted by [CONTACT_440541]-1. We anticipate that ICD will not only curtail the 
immunosuppressive activity of T cells, but will also increase the source of antigen and improve the 
context of antigen presentation (by [CONTACT_440542]) that could lead to greater immune cell 
activation in the cervical cancer environment. However, cisplatin is deleterious to activated effector T 
cells (our unpublished data), and irradiation and chemotherapy can recruit myeloid cells and 
regulatory cells with immunosuppressive function.[ 9, 10] Therefore, the sequencing of SOC with PD- [ADDRESS_558654] cervical cancer. 
Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is an PD-1 antibody approved for use in melanoma,[ 11] and the proposed 
study focuses on evaluating the influence of the addition of pembrolizumab to standard CRT, and 
sequencing of pembrolizumab with CRT, on CD8+ infiltrating T cells in subjects with locally advanced 
cervical cancer. 
Secondary objectives of the study will estimate clinical endpoints to obtain preliminary data regarding 
the potential clinical effect of the combination. W e will estimate the rate of complete metabolic 
response as measured by [CONTACT_10052]/CT a t 12 weeks, as well as the rate of distant (versus local) 
rec
urrence.  
There is no data available to predict the optimal time point to incorporate immunotherapy into a 
treatment course. Therefore, this study will evaluate biological endpoints and responses to 
immunotherapy given at the time of chemotherapy and following completion of chemotherapy.  
 
 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
An open-label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical 
activity of single agent MK-3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 
1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid 
tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed.  This 
first in human study of MK-3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of 
tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been 
identified to date. Recent data from other clinical studies within the MK-3475 program has shown that 
a lower dose of MK-3475 and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and 
clinical activity. 
PK data analysis of MK-3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, limited 
volume of distribution, and a long half-life (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2 release assay) 
suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and 
pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
Product:   Pembrolizumab  14 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_558655] a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences 
in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen 
are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK-3475 in the 
melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in 
melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5-fold higher dose 
and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor 
burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma 
indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication 
settings. 
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in solid 
tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 
10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure-response relationships of pembrolizumab 
for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of 
effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_440543]) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement 
will not vary meaningfully with tumor type. 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose 
of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained 
with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure 
range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain 
individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated 
and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to 
reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistical 
chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Biomarker Resear ch 
The overall rationale for this study is that the addition of pembrolizumab to the standard of care 
chemoradiation treatment may improve survival for cervical cancer patients by [CONTACT_440544]. It is anticipated that pembrolizumab treatment will favorably improve the 
ratio of effector CD8+ T cells: regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment.   Biopsies and blood 
samples to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be collected pre, during and post 
treatments in both arms. We will determine whether the inclusion of pembrolizumab: 1) alters the 
quantity and quality of tumor lymphocytic infiltration; 2) increases the systemic immune response 
against tumor-associated antigens. 
Tumor lymphocyte infiltration: PD-1 blockade (pembrolizumab) can support CD8+ T cell function in 
the periphery, either by [CONTACT_440545], or potentially by [CONTACT_440546] T cell development and function. Thus, pembrolizumab 
Product:   Pembrolizumab  15 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, 06 March 2018   
 
 has the potential to synergize with CRT to augment CD8+ T cell responses. Tumor biopsies will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_440547] a broad 
characterization of the effect of treatment on lymphocyte and myeloid cell composition and immune 
function .  
These studies will provide a direct assessment of the capability of PD-[ADDRESS_558656] on long term immune responses initiated in CRT-treated subjects. Our goal is 
to generate preliminary data addressing whether the addition of pembrolizumab to CRT promotes the 
modulation of cellular subsets that are likely to be involved in controlling tumor outgrowth and whether 
concomitant treatment alters patterns of adaptive resistance (checkpoint molecules; 
immunosuppressive cellular populations; inhibitory cytokines) compared to CRT alone. With respect 
to immunological outcomes, our expectation is that the addition of pembrolizumab will augment the 
magnitude and the function of intratumoral and systemic tumor-specific CD8+ T cells (as judged by 
[CONTACT_440548]), and will lead to increased expression of HLA, MICA and PDL1 compared to CRT 
alone. We will learn whether pembrolizumab can modulate NK and Treg frequencies in tumors in 
addition to peripheral blood. Furthermore, we anticipate that CRT will initially deplete tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes, but that the consolidation regimen of pembrolizumab post CRT will increase the 
acuteness and magnitude of the response driven by [CONTACT_349643]. 
Systemic response : Flow cytometry will be used to examine blood for an increase in HLA-DR (a 
marker of recent T cell activation) expressing CD8+ T cells. ELIspot assays, using overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_440516] E2, E5, E6 and E7, will be used to determine whether treatment 
induces/increases CD8+ T cell responses to defined cervical cancer antigens. 
Human Papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) and tumor immunogenicity:  DNA is detected in virtually all cervical 
cancers, and HPV specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are found in cervical tumors.[ 3] The failure of the 
immune system to eradicate HPV DNA integration is due to cancer cells’ acquisition of resistance to 
cytotoxic T cells, including down-regulation of HLA class I, down-regulation of MHC class I chain-
related molecule A (MICA), production of immune-suppressive cytokines, and induction of FoxP3+ 
immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.[ 4] The presence of CD8+ T cells specific for HPV-antigens in 
cervical cancer subjects is limited, considering the potential immunogenicity of these antigens. Tumor 
infiltration by [CONTACT_440549] T cell activation ; 
deficiencies in lymphocyte trafficking into tumor; or poor survival and proliferation in the tumor site. In 
preclinical models, both cisplatin and irradiation have profound influences on the cellular and cytokine 
components of the tumor; they can lead to the death of immunosuppressive cell subsets, the release 
of damage associated molecular patterns that can activate DC resulting in increased T cell activation 
and presence of lymphocytes within tumors. Whether this occurs in human disease has not been 
assessed. However, irradiation can induce many negative feedback mechanisms, and has the 
capacity to induce PD-L1 expression either directly, or as a part of adaptive resistance to the effector 
activity of infiltrating lymphocytes. Furthermore, it is unknown whether low-dose cisplatin will 
eradicate both regulatory and effector T cells in the tumor site, and whether any HPV-specific CD8+ T 
cell response can be elicited subsequent to SOC treatment and whether these cells express PD- [ADDRESS_558657]:   Pembrolizumab  16

5.3 Dose Selection/Modification 
 Dose Selection  
The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this trial is provided in Section 4.0 – Background 
and Rationale.  Details on preparation and administration of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) are provided 
in the Pharmacy Manual.   
 Dose Modification  
Dose modifications in response to treatment-related adverse events are permitted in order to keep 
the participant on study drug. Details on the modifications for each study intervention are provided in 
the sections below. In general: 
i. Dose modifications for reasons other than treatment related adverse events are not allowed on 
this protocol. Relationship to treatment should be determined as outline in Table 7 .  
ii. Whenever treatment is held pending resolution of toxicity to grade 1 or 0, this criterion may also 
be met if the toxicity resolves to pre-study baseline grade (if toxicity was present at baseline). 
iii. Study drugs and radiation may be held together or separately. Investigator discretion is 
permitted to determine which drug is the source for a given toxicity and to adjust the dosage of 
pembrolizumab, cisplatin, or radiation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_440518]. If study drugs are held for 
hematological toxicity, radiation therapy may be continued at the investigator’s discretion in 
order to minimize treatment delays.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Pembrolizumab Dose Modification  
Modification of the dose of pembrolizumab is not allowed on this study. The dose of pembrolizumab 
can be delayed or withheld due to adverse events. Adverse events (both non-serious and serious) 
associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. Pembrolizumab 
must be withheld for drug-related toxicities and severe or life-threatening AEs as per Error! 
Reference source not found.  below. See Section 5.5.[ADDRESS_558672] Guidance 
Document for supportive care guidelines, including use of corticosteroids. 
Pembrolizumab should be administered once every 21 days for 3 cycles. If a delay in dosing is 
required per the guidelines in Error! Reference source not found. , then the dose may be delayed 
for up to [ADDRESS_558673] cycle (if the toxicity has resolved to Grade 0-1 or baseline). If the third 
dose cannot be administered due to unresolved toxicity within [ADDRESS_558674] may continue 
on study without additional pembrolizumab (may continue to receive cisplatin and RT). In general, 
please follow the following pembrolizumab-specific guidelines: 
i. Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade [ADDRESS_558675] 4 weeks. This criterion may also be met if the toxicity resolves to pre-study 
baseline grade (if toxicity was present at baseline). 
ii. For severe and life-threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated first followed by [CONTACT_440551]. Other immunosuppressive treatment should be initiated if irAEs cannot be controlled by 
[CONTACT_13216]. 
iii. For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld and the toxicity has not resolved within 
7 days, the dose may be skipped. Otherwise, pembrolizumab can be resumed after AE has 
been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 (or baseline, as described in “i”) and corticosteroid has been 
tapered.

[IP_ADDRESS] Cisplatin Dose Modifications  
Toxicity due to cisplatin administration may be managed by [CONTACT_188192], dose 
interruptions and adjustment of cisplatin dose. Recommended dose reductions are provided in Table 
3. Dose should only be reduced once and future dosing should continue at the reduced dose.   If the 
reduced dose cannot be tolerated the subject may continue on study without cisplatin (may continue 
to receive pembrolizumab and RT).

 [IP_ADDRESS].1 Recommendations for Cisplatin Dose Modifications  
Gastrointestinal Adverse Effects  
 For nausea and vomiting, anti-emetics should be used prophylactically.  
 For Grade 4 nausea and vomiting, reduce Cisplatin by [CONTACT_30560].  
Renal/Genitourinary Adverse Effects  
 If creatinine rises to greater than 2.0 mg /dl, hold cisplatin therapy. If creatinine does not 
recover after a one-week delay, discontinue cisplatin for remainder of regimen.  
 Selective renal tubular defects are sometimes observed:  
o Hypocalcemia with hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia are common and potentially 
severe.  
o Replacement of magnesium, calcium and potassium are usually effective.  
o Severe tubular effects, although rare, may require chronic replacement therapy.  
o Diagnostic tests for alternative mechanisms of hypocalcemia (e.g. GI or metabolic) 
should be considered.  
Neurologic Adverse Effects  
 Grade 1 - No change  
 Grade 2 - Reduce Cisplatin by [CONTACT_30560]  
 Grade 3- 4 – Hold cisplatin.  Reduce Cisplatin by [CONTACT_440552] ≤ Grade 2 
Blood/Bone Marrow (Hematologic) Adverse Effects  
 Cisplatin should be withheld from patients with an ANC less than 1,000 or platelet count less 
than 50,000. Therapy should be delayed week- by-week until these levels are exceeded. Any 
interruption in cisplatin for longer than one week due to toxicity requires a dose reduction of 
one level.  
 External radiation should continue while drug is withheld. 
 
 Timing of Dose Administration  
The below sections describe the recommended timing of study specific treatments. Treatments may 
be delayed up to 3 days (without this being considered to be a protocol violation) for major life events 
(e.g., serious illness in a family member, major holiday, vacation which is unable to be re-scheduled). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cisplatin 
Cisplatin chemotherapy will consist of weekly administrations of 40 mg/m2 of cisplatin administered in 
1 L of IV fluid (according to local protocol) delivered in 1 hour IV infusion (per institutional guidelines) 
The maximum dose of cisplatin administered should not exceed [ADDRESS_558679] be given prior to radiation therapy that day. Cisplatin should be 
given on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. Cisplatin infusion should proceed after all 
procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).

Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, 06 March 2018   
 
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pembrolizumab 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks.  Sites should 
make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given 
the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of - 5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted 
(i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min). 
Pembrolizumab should be administered on day of treatment after all pretreatment 
procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0). Trial 
treatment may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled treatment date due to 
administrative reasons. 
Pembrolizumab treatment to subjects in Arm 2 should be given prior to any other chemoradiation 
treatment (i.e. prior to radiation therapy). It is recommended that subjects receive pembrolizumab on 
the same day as cisplatin. The pembrolizumab infusion can be administered concurrent to the pre-
hydration for the cisplatin treatment. 
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Radiation Treatments 
Radiation therapy details will be identical for both Arms 1 and 2. This trial will include external beam 
radiation therapy (EBRT), including intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and image-guided 
brachytherapy with three-dimensional (3-D) treatment planning. IMRT is included as it may reduce 
the acute normal tissue toxicity from cervical cancer radiotherapy[ 14], and 3-D planned brachytherapy 
has been shown to improve local tumor control and reduce toxicity compared to two-dimensional 
planning.[ 15] Standard doses of external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy will be delivered, 
and this radiation therapy section is written with the purpose of including the range of treatment 
approaches used by [CONTACT_40291], as long as the cumulative doses are within the 
target range. Each institution may follow their specific institutional policies for IMRT, including 
pseudo-split-field IMRT.[ 16]  Parametrial boosts and nodal boosts may be delivered using either 
sequential or concomitant-integrated boost methods. Investigators may use both simultaneous and 
integrated boosts to comply with local institutional policies.[ 17] All IMRT and brachytherapy 
treatments must be delivered within a total of 8 weeks. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 External Beam Radiation Therapy 
IMRT planning is encouraged in this study. However, three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy 
is permitted instead of IMRT if cumulative organ- at-risk (OAR) constraints are respected. The EBRT 
plan will deliver at least 45 Gy, with treatment sites including the primary tumor and nodal volumes. 
Consensus guidelines are suggested to define target volume definition for IMRT.[ 18] This may be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_440553] 5.4-18 Gy as indicated (up to total dose of 63 Gy by 
[CONTACT_440554]).  Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy is permitted instead of IMRT if cumulative 
organ- at-risk (OAR) constraints are respected.

(i.e., MRI and/or PET imaging) can be used based on institutional practice. OAR volumes should 
include the entire organ (rather than just the wall of the organ) for ease of reporting. The radiation 
therapy case report forms will use the following nomenclature, so consistent labeling is suggested. 
Investigators may choose to label structures differently according to institutional standards, and the 
target volume and OAR labeling are suggestions, not protocol requirements . , When completing the 
c
ase report forms, investigators are asked to simply report the requested data for their target volume 
that is most similar to the structures described below. The case report form will request the data using 
the following labels: 
Target Volumes  Description

HR-CTV (high risk CTV)  Gross tumor alone (GTV) or gross tumor and highest 
risk area at time of brachytherapy  (HR-CTV)  
GTVnodal  Gross tumor v olume for lymph node as identified on 
imaging or exam. Dose to the nodal volume receiving 
highest boost dose will be requested.  
CTVnodal  Clinical target volume for regional lymph nodes. 
Prescription dose to at -risk nodal regions will be 
requested.  
OARs  Description

Treatment Delivery 
Daily imaging is recommended during EBRT to permit verification of target alignment. Imaging and 
alignment method is to follow institutional practice, and can consist of orthogonal plain films, kV 
matching or CT imaging. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_558682] of 4-6 fractions of 5-7 Gy per fraction delivered with high-dose-rate (HDR) 
brachytherapy, based on institutional practice.  Brachytherapy is not to be delivered on the same day 
as cisplatin chemotherapy.  
Either CT-based or MRI-based treatment planning will be permitted for brachytherapy. The minimum 
EQD2Gy for the highest dose encompassing 90% (D90) of the high-risk clinical target volume (HR-
CTV) or gross tumor volume (GTV) is 80 Gy, consistent with ABS guidelines.[ 20] It is recommended 
that the HR-CTV D90 is ≥ 100% of the prescription dose and the HR-CTV volume encompassing 
100% of the target volume (V100) is ≥ 90%.  
Cumulative doses to rectum, bladder, sigmoid and bowel will be followed to limit doses below 
threshold values for dose to the hottest 2 cc (D2cc) as calculated by [CONTACT_440555] 2 Gy fractions 
(EQD2Gy) using a modified version of the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) worksheet. The 
EQD2Gy limits will be 90 Gy for bladder and 75 Gy for rectum and sigmoid. This is consistent with 
ABS guidelines.[ 20]

5.4 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria and listed in Section 5.4.[ADDRESS_558684]-Treatment Follow-up Phase. 
If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically 
prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required. The 
investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor-Investigator. The final 
decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's 
primary physician.  
 Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be administered 
at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981].  
 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_43837]: 
 Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
 Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
 Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol 
 Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab 
 Radiation therapy not specified in this protocol 
 Live vaccines  
 Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of 
clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor-Investigator.

Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, 06 March 2018   
 
 5.5 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care 
 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_124133]. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined below and in greater detail in the ECI guidance document. 
Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with 
corticosteroids as well as additional anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with 
administration of corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as 
symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be 
made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which mi ght 
require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are recommended when the investigator 
determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator is instructed to 
follow the ECI reporting guidance but does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined in 
the ECI guidance document). Refer to Section 5.3.2  for guidelines regarding dosing delays and 
modifications .  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event. These procedures should be performed at the 
discretion of the investigator and are not mandated by [CONTACT_760]. Suggested conditional 
procedures, as appropriate, can be found in the ECI guidance document. 
 Pneumonitis :  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 
weeks. 
o For Grade 3-4 events,  immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  Administer 
additional anti-inflammatory measures, as needed. 
For Grade 3-4 events, or recurrent Grade 2 events , permanently discontinue 
Pembrolizumab. 
o Monitor participants for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis 
o Evaluate participants with suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging and 
initiate corticosteroid treatment 
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged 
steroid administration. 
 
 Myocarditis:  
o Ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology and/or exclude other causes  
o Administer corticosteroids based on severity of event  
 
 Diarrhea/Colitis : 
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).

Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, 06 March 2018   
 
  
If diarrhea/colitis occurs prior to initiation of pembrolizumab or can be attributed to the CRT 
treatment, then subjects should be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear fluids and will 
receive standard management for diarrhea with loperamide, low residue diet and Lomotil if 
needed.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be substituted 
via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea where colitis is suspected, consider GI 
consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis. 
If diarrhea/colitis occurs after subject has received any administration of pembrolizumab, then 
it is critically important to evaluate the subject for immune-related diarrhea/colitis. The 
diarrhea/colitis is likely to be immune-related if it has any of the following characteristics: 
o Bloody or mucous stools 
o Crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
o occurs at a timepoint not typi[INVESTIGATOR_440520] (i.e., in first 2 weeks of treatment or 
after completion of external beam RT)  
If the event meets these criteria, then it should be treated as follows: 
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.   
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis  that is felt to be possibly, probably, or likely related to 
investigational agent, administer oral corticosteroids consistent with the guidelines in 
the pembrolizumab lab . Current recommendation is to start at an initial dose of 1 to 2 
mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent. 
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis  that is felt to be possibly, probably, or likely related 
to investigational agent and that persists > 1 week, treat with intravenous steroids 
followed by [CONTACT_78018].   
o Withhold pembrolizumab administration for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) 
colitis, and permanently discontinue pembrolizumab administration for life-threatening 
(Grade 4) colitis. 
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
 
 
 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ Grade 3 
Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis (DKA) 
 
o For T1DM  or Grade 3-4  Hyperglycemia 
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and 
anti-hyperglycemic in participants for Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia with evidence 
of Beta-cell failure .  
 Monitor participants for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of 
diabetes. 
 Evaluate subjects with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, and C-peptide.  
 
 Hypophysitis : 
Product:   Pembrolizumab  30 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, 06 March 2018   
 
  
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 
or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is 
tapered. 
o For Grade 3-4  events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_79918]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
o Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_77975]) 
 
 Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism :  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor subjects for changes in 
thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated 
based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. 
 
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2-4  hypothyroidism): 
 In hyperthyroidism, non-selective be ta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy. 
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine 
or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care. 
o Grade 3-4  hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019]. 
When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
 
 Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2- 4 events, monitor with liver function tests (weekly or more frequently 
until returned to baseline values or is stable. 
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids 
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
 
 Renal Failure or Nephritis : 
o For Grade 2-4  events, treat with corticosteroids (prednisone 1-2 mg/kg or equivalent) 
followed by [CONTACT_13217]. 
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
o Monitor changes in renal function 
 
 Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly 
after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. 
Table 5 below  shows treatment guidelines for subjects who experience an infusion reaction 
associated with administration of pembrolizumab (MK-3475).

5.6 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations 
 Diet 
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE such as 
diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. 
Product:   Pembrolizumab  32 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_558686]-feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are 
considered highly unlikely to conceive. Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) sterilized surgically 
or as a result of radiation treatments, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age and 
has not had menses for greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not 
heterosexually active for the duration of the study. The two birth control methods can be either two 
barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. Subjects should 
start using birth control from study Visit [ADDRESS_558687] 
dose of study therapy, or until they are no longer of childbearing potential .  
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by [CONTACT_47446]), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide. Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will 
include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a 
progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents). 
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus 
(unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to participate in the study they 
must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of the study and 
during the follow-up period . If there is any question that a subject will not reliably comply with the 
requirements for contraception, that subject should not be entered into the study.  
 Use in Pregnancy  
If a subject becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab, the subject will immediately 
be removed from the study. The site will contact [CONTACT_308061]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The outcome of the 
pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor-Investigator. If the outcome is a serious adverse 
experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening 
complication to the mother or newborn), this should be reported within [ADDRESS_558688] Participation and Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria 
A subject is considered On-Study from the time eligibility is confirmed through the follow-up interval. 
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur. In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_440556] e Sponsor-Investigator if enrollment into the trial is inappropriate, 
Product:   Pembrolizumab  33 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, 06 March 2018   
 
 the trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.  Specific details regarding 
discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in the sections below. 
 Duration of T reatment  
Subjects will continue to receive study treatment (defined as chemoradiation and pembrolizumab) 
until: 
 S ubject has completed all study treatments  
 Di sease progression 
 Unac ceptable adverse event(s)  
 S ubject withdraws consent for further treatment 
 F emale subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test 
 S ubject receives a non-study treatment (not protocol-specified) for their cancer 
 S ubject non-compliance 
 G eneral or specific changes in the subject’s condition render the subject unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator 
If any of the above events occurs, the subject will be considered off treatment and in follow-up. 
Subjects will be followed for 5 years for PFS and OS, or until the trial is terminated per Section 5.7.4 .  
 Discontinuation/Withdrawal from Study  
Subjects may withdraw or be discontinued from the study at any time for any of the following reasons: 
 Subject decides to withdraw from the study  
 S ubject is unable or unwilling to complete the follow-up procedures 
 The subject is lost to follow- up 
 Death 
The primary reason for discontinuation or withdrawal should be entered into OnCore.  All subjects 
that discontinue or withdraw from the study will continue to receive standard of care treatment. 
Subjects who have withdrawn consent for the study will not be followed for any reason.   
A subject’s participation is considered completed when the subject has completed the [ADDRESS_558689] Status Definitions  
Enrolled: All subjects who sign an informed consent will be considered enrolled on the study. All 
subjects consented on the study must be entered into OnCore. 
Screen Failure: A subject who is withdrawn or discontinues from the study prior to receiving any 
treatment is considered a post enrollment screen failure. Post enrollment screen failures are not 
considered a study accrual and will be replaced. Note: The UVa IRB-HSR defines any individual that 
has signed an informed consent as an enrollment in this study and so screen failures should be 
reported to the IRB with enrollment numbers.

Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, 06 March 2018   
 
 On-Study: A subject is considered on-study on the date when the study team has confirmed the 
subject has met all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, and the treating 
physician/surgeon or study PI [INVESTIGATOR_440522]. 
Randomized: A subject that has been randomized to an arm is considered a randomized subject. 
On-Treatment: A subject is considered on-treatment on the date that CRT is initiated  
Off-Treatment: A subject is considered off-treatment on the date that they have met any of the criteria 
listed in Section 5.7.1  
On Follow- up: A subject is considered on follow-up on the date that they have met any of the criteria 
listed in Section 5.7.1 .    
Off-Study: A subject is considered off-study if they are removed from the study for any of the reasons 
listed in Section 5.7.[ADDRESS_558690] completed the follow-up interval. 
 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination  
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified below: 
1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete 
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements 
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this or other studies indicates a potential health 
hazard to subjects 
4. Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the study drug 
In the event of a decision by [CONTACT_440557], ample notification will be provided 
so that appropriate adjustments to subject treatment can be made. 
 Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open-label trial; therefore, the Sponsor-Investigator, investigator and subject will know the 
treatment administered.

 6.2 TRIAL PROCEDURES 
6.3 Trial Procedures 
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each visit. 
Individual trial procedures are described in detail below. It may be necessary to perform these 
procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093]. 
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034]-Investigator 
and/or [COMPANY_006] for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may require that 
additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such evaluations/testing 
will be performed in accordance with those regulations. 
 Administrative Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Informed Consent 
The Investigator must obtain documented consent from each potential subject prior to participating in 
a clinical trial. Consent must be documented by [CONTACT_423]’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_423]’s 
legally acceptable representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along with the dated signature 
[CONTACT_63564].  
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before participation in the 
trial. 
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form and any 
written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s approval in advance of use.  
The subject or his/her legally acceptable representative should be informed in a timely manner if new 
information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue 
participation in the trial.  The communication of this information will be provided and documented via 
a revised consent form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated 
signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_423]’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature. 
Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at the 
protocol level.   
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/ERC requirements, applicable laws and regulations and 
Sponsor-Investigator requirements. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Registration  
Subjects who are consented to the study must be registered in OnCore in accordance with the 
University of Virginia Cancer Center OnCore SOP, which can be found on the OnCore Resources 
page (see the Oncore Help tab). General guidelines are provided below for reference, but the 
procedure should follow the OnCore SOP in case of any discrepancy. 
All subjects who have signed an informed consent should have the following information entered into 
OnCore:

Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_558703] 
(ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology (termed immune-related adverse events, or irAEs); see 
separate ECI guidance document regarding the identification, evaluation and management of 
potential irAEs.   
Please refer to Section 6.4 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of AEs.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Exam 
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam during the screening 
period.  Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical history.   
At subsequent visits requiring a physical exam per the Trial Flow Chart, the investigator or qualified 
designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated. On treatment days the physical 
exam should be performed prior to trial treatment administration.  The physical exam conducted at 
the time of the post-treatment imaging should include, at a minimum, a clinical tumor assessment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs 
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the administration of 
each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in the Trial Flow Chart 
(Section 6.0). Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], weight and blood 
pressure. Height will be measured at screening only. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale 
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status at screening, prior to the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment and discontinuation of trial treatment as specified in the 
Trial Flow Chart.

[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease 
Baseline imaging should be obtained within 6 weeks of the start of treatment and should include MRI 
and PET/CT. A pelvic MRI is required only at the Pre-Study Assessments unless there are 
contraindications or at the discretion of investigator.   
PET/CT should be inclusive of the skull base to the thigh area (“eyes to thighs”) and should be 
performed during the Pre-Study Assessments for initial staging. PET/CT should be repeated at 12 
weeks ± 10 days after completion of CRT for evaluation of disease .     
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Tissue Collection and Correlative Studies Blood Sampling 
Blood and tumor tissue should be collected from subjects at the intervals specified in the Trial Flow 
Chart and sent to the University of Virginia for analysis. All blood and tissue will be stored for 
research.  
 
Tissue Markers: Tissue samples will be evaluated for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes using flow 
cytometry (FC) and standard immunohistochemical (IHC) staining techniques. Flow cytometry will be 
performed using standard techniques as described previously. For immunohistochemistry, tissue 
microarrays will be prepared using tissue cores from representative tumor areas from the FFPE 
tissue blocks. The tissue microarray will be incubated with specific antibodies, and positive and 
negative controls. Staining will be quantitated in quadruplicate by a pathologist blinded to the sample 
identity. Total cell count will be expressed in cells/mm2 and density will be expressed as a number of 
cells per high power field (hpf). Staining will be determined in the five most abundant areas, using the 
average over the five to determine the percentage. 
 
In addition, gene expression arrays on the resected tumor samples will be performed as a part of this 
study and may assist in identifying the activation of these receptors and factors.  
 
Circulating Biomarkers: Collected blood will be processed to isolate peripheral blood lymphocytes.  
ELIspot analyses will be performed on PBMCs isolated from blood samples at each timepoint. 
 
The planned initial analyses of the samples include the markers specified in this protocol; howeve r 
actual analyses conducted may vary slightly as new information and technology develop. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_558707] be collected at the intervals specified in the Trial Flow Chart, adhering to 
the following guidelines: 
1. Pre-study Tissue sample: Fresh tissue must be collected from an office biopsy performed 
within the 4 weeks prior to start of treatment. If this biopsy yields insufficient tumor tissue, an 
archival sample may be requested. 
2. CRT Treatment Sample:  Fresh tissue must be collected during CRT treatment , at 5 ± [ADDRESS_558708]:   Pembrolizumab  44 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, 06 March 2018   
 
  
 
 3. Treatment completion: Fresh tissue must be collected from an office biopsy performed at 12 
weeks ± 10 days following completion of CRT .   
Fresh tumor tissue should be divided into portions for several preparations including formalin fixed 
paraffin embedded (FFPE) in blocks, flash freezing and single cell isolations . Detail instructions fo r

 Visit Requirements  
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6.0 - Trial Flow Chart. Specific procedure-related details are 
provided above in Section 7.1 - Trial Procedures. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening 
Prior to the performance of any study-specific procedures, the patient will have the nature of the study 
explained to them, and will be asked to give written informed consent. Informed consent must be 
obtained prior to any study-specific procedures that do not form a part of the patient’s normal care. 
However, assessments performed according to standard of care prior to receipt of informed consent 
may be utilized to fulfill the screening requirement, if completed within the required window for 
screening.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Period 
The treatment period will consist of the duration of chemoradiation and pembrolizumab treatments . 
Subject should receive study assessments as defined in the Trial Flow Chart. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Post-treatment Visits 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_558709] study 
treatment in all subjects to perform the safety assessments defined in the Trial Flow Chart. Any 
assessments that were performed within 3 days prior to this visit do not need to be repeated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Survival Follow- up  
Following completion of treatment, subjects should be followed for [ADDRESS_558710]:   Pembrolizumab  45 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_558711] study treatment .  
Af
ter informed consent has been obtained,  and prior to initiation of investigational treatment, onl y 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol-mandated intervention should be reported (e.g., serious 
adverse events related to invasive procedures such as biopsies). 
After initiation of study treatment , all adverse events will be reported according to the guidelines in 
the following sections. Throughout the study, investigators should report any deaths, serious adverse 
events, or other adverse events of concern that are believed to be related to the investigational 
intervention. 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any 
clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is 
temporally associated with the use of pembrolizumab, is also an adverse event. 
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of Pembrolizumab in clinical trials or within 
the follow-up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose 
(whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal. 
A summary of the adverse event collection and reporting is provided in Table [ADDRESS_558712]

Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_558716]’s medical record. Adverse events should be assessed for seriousness, severity, 
attribute and expectedness, in relation to Pembrolizumab treatment, by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_126985]. The following sections provide definitions for adverse event characteristics and reporting 
requirements.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Expectedness 
The expectedness of the adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_440560], the Investigator’s Brochure or package insert and the Investigator’s experience. Adverse 
events commonly observed with the standard of care chemoradiation treatment, such as 
hematological, genitourinary and gastrointestinal, should be expected during the CRT interval. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_558717] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.03. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.03 
can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Attribution  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_440523], if any, to 
pembrolizumab.  See Table 8 for further guidance on evaluation of attribute. The following criteria will 
define the attribution: 
Definite:   The AE is clearly related to the investigational intervention. 
Probable:  The AE is likely related to the investigational intervention.  
Possible:  The AE may be related to the investigational intervention. 
Unlikely : The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational intervention. 
Unrelated : The AE is NOT related to the investigational intervention. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that: 
 Results in death; 
 Is life threatening; 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
 Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study); 
 Is associated with an overdose; 
 Is another important medical event  
*Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66301] a serious adverse 
event, except if the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440524]: 
Product:   Pembrolizumab  47 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, 06 March 2018   
 
  
 
  The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440525] 24 hours without an admission 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25678] 
 Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33402] (e.g., for anticipated or protocol 
specified procedures such as administration of Intravenous fluids, central line 
insertion, biopsy procedures ) 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria are 
met: 
o The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440526].  
o The subject has not suffered an adverse event. 
If the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440527], then it is not considered a serious adverse event.  
Refer to Table 7  for additional details regarding each of the above criteria. 
 Definition  of an Overdose  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed dose for 
pembrolizumab by 20% over the prescribed dose. No specific information is available on the 
treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the event of overdose, pembrolizumab should be 
discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive 
treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a Pembrolizumab, the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met. 
If a dose of pembrolizumab meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-
serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose 
without adverse effect.” 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to the 
Sponsor-Investigator (Fax notification to UVa) using the Safety Reporting Form. 
 Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor -Investigator  
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of 
investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously 
reported to them) that occurs during the trial or within [ADDRESS_558718] be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed 
abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and 
stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events).  If the pregnancy continues 
to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.  
Such events must be reported within [ADDRESS_558719]:   Pembrolizumab  48 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, 06 March 2018   
 
  
 
 
 Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor -Investigator  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events 
Any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause 
other than progression of the cancer under study that occurs to any subject from the time of start of 
treatment through [ADDRESS_558720] (See Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be forwarded to Sponsor-Investigator 
and will be handled in the same manner as SAEs.  
Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician to be 
related to Pembrolizumab that is brought to the attention of the investigator at any time outside of the 
time period specified in the previous paragraph also must be reported immediately to the Sponsor-
Investigator. 
All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Events of Clinical Interest 
Selected non-serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) 
and must be recorded as such on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets and reported 
within [ADDRESS_558721] for this trial include: 
1.  an overdose of Pembrolizumab, as defined in Section 6.4.[ADDRESS_558722] of protocol-specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.* 
*Note:  These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of 
the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional 
evaluation for an underlying etiology.  The trial site guidance for assessment and follow up of 
these criteria can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent). 
3. Additional adverse events: 
 A separate guidance document has been provided titled “Event of Clinical Interest Guidance 
Document” (previously entitled, “Event of Clinical Interest and Immune-Related Adverse Event 
Guidance Document”).  This document provides guidance regarding identification, evaluation and

Relationship to 
test drug  Did the [COMPANY_006] product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event will be provided by [CONTACT_26368] a qualified physici an. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the 
AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for th e require d regulatory time frame. 
The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relations hip between the test drug and the 
adverse event based upon the available information.  
The following compo nents are to be used to assess the relationship between the [COMPANY_006] product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the 
components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse e vent (AE ): 
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance  assessment 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the [COMPANY_006] product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)?  
 Likely  Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or  environmental 
factors

participants will be randomized 1:1 between the two arms. All participants receiving any protocol 
treatment will be evaluated for safety and the primary immunologic endpoint which is the ratio of the 
phenotype of HPV-specific CD8+ T cells to regulatory T cells (CD8+/Treg). Patterns of change in 
other immunologic endpoints assessed in the tissue and blood will be estimated along with 90%

 7.2 Sample size and accrual 
Results in Jordanova ES, et al 2008, report estimates of CD8+/Treg for normal cervix and cervical 
cancers tissue for cervical cancer patients who underwent radical hysterectomy with 
lymphadenectomy.[ 4] These data provide the assumed "natural baseline" of cancer patients’ in this 
study with CD8+/Tregs being lower in cancer tissue, and results in a Cohen’s dav effect size (ES) of 
0.45. Estimated sample size is based upon being able to detect a similar effect size between 
CD8+/Tregs at baseline and end of CRT, and baseline to the [ADDRESS_558734] CRT assessment without 
correction for multiple comparisons. Data from Nilges, K et al, 2003, indicates a mean (standard 
deviation) of 23.32 (15.39) in CD8+/Tregs measured in the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from 
patients with cervical cancer. Given these data, 44 eligible patients are required (per arm) to assess 
change in pre/post CD8+/Tregs with an ES of 0.45 with type I and II errors of 10%. Each within arm 
comparison supports the following hypothesis. Cisplatin can kill T cells, therefore the CRT may 
eliminate both CD8+ HPV CTL and Tregs, and the ensuing or concurrent pembrolizumab treatment 
may increase the CD8+/Treg ratio (test that pembrolizumab will increase CD8+/Tregs to an ES of 
0.45). 
Adjusting for an overall 10% ineligibility/drop-out rate, maximum accrual to the study is estimated at 
98 patients. Accrual is estimated at 4 patients a month, thus accrual to the study should be completed 
by 2.0 years with primary analysis at 3 years. 
7.3 Randomization 
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to arms 1 and 2, respectively. Block randomization within 
site with random block sizes of 2, 4 or 6 will be employed. 
7.4 Safety and Futility Monitoring 
 Safety monitoring  
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event which: i) is determined to be at least 
possibly related to treatment with pembrolizumab; ii) occurs within the first [ADDRESS_558735] 
pembrolizumab infusion; and iii) meets one of the below criteria: 
 Pneumonitis Grade ≥ 3 
 Any non-hematological toxicity Grade ≥ 3, except for the following: 
o Grade [ADDRESS_558736] of care cisplatin and radiation 
o Grade 3 Colitis, hypophisitis, or hyperthyroidism  lasting less than 7 days 
o Grade 3 electrolyte toxicities that are corrected to grade 1 or less within 24 
hours 
o Grade 3 hypertension that can be controlled with oral medications and does 
not require treatment delay for > [ADDRESS_558737]/ALT if < 1.5 times the baseline level  
o Grade 3 elevation of ALP (alkaline phosphatase)  
o Grade [ADDRESS_558738]:   Pembrolizumab  56 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  UVA-LACC -PD201, Version 4.0, 06 March 2018   
 
   
 
 o Grade 3 rash if it returns to ≤ grade 2 after 1 week of symptomatic treatment 
 Any Grade ≥ 4 toxicity 
 Other AEs if they are clearly related to pembrolizumab and are causing substantial 
morbidity for subjects, as determined by [CONTACT_180184]. 
Within each arm, safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_440562] a 
DLT. Results reported in ASCO 2015 abstracts [ 22, 23] for pembrolizumab in combination with other 
tr
eatments resulted in an overall DLT rate of 1/59=2% with a 90%CI(1%, 8%). For this study t he 
upper boundary of a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) based upon a binomial test of proportions 
for DLT will be used for monitoring to protect against excessive failure rates.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_440532] a SPRT contrasting a 5% versus 25% DLT rate, with nominal type I and II errors of 10% and 
10%, respectively. The slope of the parallel line for monitoring is 1.190 and the intercept is 0.128. 
Safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_440533]. If a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_440534], co-
investigators and the DSMC can review the data, and determine if the study should  continue, be 
amended or be closed to further accrual. 
 
Incidence of treatment related DLTs  
Number of patients in an Arm  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3106]  
2-6 ≥ 2 
7-14 ≥ 3 
15-21 ≥ 4 
22-29 ≥ 5 
30-37 ≥ 6 
38-44 ≥ [ADDRESS_558739] commonly associated with CD8+ T cell infiltration into tumors, and response 
rates for other solid malignancies are approximately 20% with pembrolizumab as a monotherapy.  
Thus, if CRT causes a reduction in the number of patients with T cell infiltration we could anticipate 
that CRT reduces the likelihood of patients responding to treatment. Assuming the current study 
population has a similar potential to respond to pembrolizumab, we would deem the study futile if 
early evidence indicates a potential to respond in a much lower percentage of subjects. We have set 
this lower target to be 5%. Futility will be monitored separately for each arm.   
For each subject, the potential to respond will be determined at the end of the [ADDRESS_558740]’s tumor and blood for the presence of immune infiltrate and HPV 
specific T cell responses. Futility will be assessed by [CONTACT_440563]8+ T cells and NK cells in the tumor, and a concomitant loss of HPV T cell 
reactivity in the blood. For the assessment of futility, each subject will be deemed to have the 
potential to respond if there are CD8+ T cells or NK cells in the tumor, or no loss of HPV T cell

 reactivity in the blood. A 3-stage design structure will be used to monitor for a null potential to 
respond of 5% versus and alternative rate of 20%. 
Within an arm, the futility assessments will occur after accrual of 14, [ADDRESS_558741] been 
accrued and followed for 12 weeks. The study specific arm will be deemed futile if 0/14, <4/29 or 
<6/[ADDRESS_558742] the potential to respond for assessment at stages 1, 2 or 3, respectively. The 
decision guideline has type I and II error rates of 0.015 and 0.185, respectively. 
 
7.5 Analyses 
The study is designed with sufficient power to assess pre/post change in immune measures with an 
ES of .[ADDRESS_558743] a predetermined difference in the changes overtime 
between the two arms. However, data from the study will be used to estimate; the magnitude of the 
difference in pre/post change for all parameters of interest between the two arms; as well as 
progression–free and overall survival. With [ADDRESS_558744] 67%, 75% and 87% 
power to detect an ES of 0 .45, 0.5 and 0.6, respectively, for continuous immune parameters 
(normality assumed) with a 10% level t-test. With 44 patients the width of a 90% CI (exact Clopper-
Pearson) around the complete metabolic response at 3 months of 70% and the distant metastases 
rate at 3 years of 20% are (57%, 81%) and (10%, 33%), respectively. Thus, any estimated rate 
outside of these bounds would be considered promising. For each arm, progression free survival 
(PFS) and overall survival will be estimated by [CONTACT_440564]-limit method of Kaplan and Meier along 
with 90% confidence bands. In patients with complete metabolic response at 3 months, 3-year PFS is 
78% (Schwartz et al, 2007).  This result will be used to guide interpretation of results on PFS from this 
study.

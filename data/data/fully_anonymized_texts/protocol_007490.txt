Project Abstract
Infertility affects 12% of couples in the [LOCATION_002]. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most advanced treatment for 
infertility. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_768438], IVF embryos continue 
to have low implantation potential (~30%/embryo). Therefore, it is not uncommon to transfer multiple embryos to the 
uterus in order to enhance success. As a result, approximately 30% of IVF pregnancies result in multiple gestation, 
which lead to higher morbidity and mortality of the mothers and infants. The best method to reduce multiple birth and 
associated morbidity and mortality is to transfer a single embryo with enhanced implantation potential. A recent meta-
analysis of acupuncture for IVF showed it may augment IVF success by ~10%, although the underlying mechanism 
remains unclear. We hypothesize that acupuncture enhances IVF success by [CONTACT_768446]. Since undergoing IVF treatment is a stressful process to most patients, we further 
hypothesize that acupuncture stabilizes the mind-body interaction by [CONTACT_768447]-being of patients 
receiving IVF treatment.  
Experimental Approach: (1) Participants: Women (ages 21 to 42) who seek IVF treatment at the Center for Fertility & 
Reproductive Surgery will be eligible for the study. Seventy women will be recruited and randomly assigned to either 
the intervention (acupuncture plus standard care) or the comparison (standard care alone) group. (2) Intervention: 
Participants in the intervention group will receive [ADDRESS_1054025] treatment 
between day 6–[ADDRESS_1054026] care. (3) Measures: The primary outcome measures include prostacyclin and thromboxane vasoactive 
biomarkers. Secondary outcome measures include perceived stress levels. (4) Procedure: Upon IRB approval, an 
informed consent will be provided to all participants.  Pre- and post- acupuncture urinary metabolites of prostacyclin and 
thromboxane will be assessed. A standardized Perceived Stress Scale will be administered before each acupuncture 
session for the study group, and before a 30-40-minute waiting period for the control group.

Background and Significance
Infertility affects approximately 1 in 8 couples (6.7 million women) in the [LOCATION_002] 
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/infertility). Treatment for infertility is often expensive, time-consuming and stressful 
for the patient and her family. IVF is the most effective treatment for infertility, as it brings the oocytes and sperm 
together directly, provides an ideal early environment for embryo development and by[CONTACT_768448], endometriosis and pelvic adhesions. However, the cost of IVF is often a limiting factor for 
families, especially noting that only 30% of embryos will successfully implant and result in pregnancy. Transferring 
multiple embryos may contribute to a higher chance of success, but this is complicated by a higher chance of multiple 
births (Pandian 2009). Multiple gestation poses a higher risk to both the mother and her pregnancy.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_768439], incubation systems and improved embryo transfer techniques, 
implantation of embryos is not always achieved. Therefore, women often seek alternative treatments to enhance their 
reproductive potential to maximize their chance of success. A recent meta-analysis of acupuncture for IVF showed 
improved success by ~10%, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear (Manheimer 2008). 
Optimal blood supply to the uterus and ovaries are essential to the development of oocytes and the timely maturation of 
the uterine lining in preparation for embryo implantation. Enhancing perfusion of the pelvic organs is likely to result in 
improved clinical outcomes. The blood perfusion to organs is determined by [CONTACT_768449], which in turn is 
controlled by [CONTACT_768450], prostacyclin and thromboxane. The former relaxes the 
vascular smooth muscle, dilates blood vessels, and prevents platelet aggregation; the latter contracts the vascular smooth 
muscle, constricts blood vessels, and promotes platelets aggregation. Both thromboxane and prostacyclin are unstable: 
the former’s half-life is 37 seconds and that of the latter is 60 minutes. Their urinary metabolites, thromboxane B 2 
(TBX2), and 2, 3-dinor-TXB 2 (both from thromboxane), and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto PGF 1α), and 2, 3-
dinor-6-keto-PGF 1α (both from prostacyclin) are very stable. The concentrations of these metabolites are fairly easily 
determined using commercially available EIA assay kits.
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine therapeutic approach involving the insertion and manipulation of needles 
in the body to stimulate specific points. In an overview of the use of acupuncture in gynecology, Napadow (2008) and 
colleagues stated that recent basic and clinical research has demonstrated that acupuncture regulates uterine and ovarian 
blood flow, and that the effect is most likely mediated as a reflex response via the ovarian sympathetic nerves, and that 
the response is controlled via the supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_61569].    Additionally, Al-Inany (2008) suggested acupuncture may 
stimulate the production of endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], which may inhibit the central nervous system’s outflow and the 
biological stress response.  
Stress is known to have a negative effect on reproduction and perhaps the menstrual cycle, and often negatively affects 
success of fertility treatment. Acupuncture has been found to reduce stress by [CONTACT_768451][INVESTIGATOR_768440]-induced elevations of HPA hormones. A recent meta-analysis by [CONTACT_7681], 
Division of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NIHCAM) showed acupuncture enhances in vitro fertilization 
(IVF) success by [CONTACT_3450] 10%.  A recent meta-analysis results showed that the pooled clinical pregnancy rate 
from all of the acupuncture groups was significantly higher than that from all of the control groups (P=0.04) (Zheng, 
2012). Six systematic reviews (including five meta-analyses) have shown that acupuncture on the day of embryo transfer 
(ET) has improved pregnancy rates in IVF (Kang, 2011). None of the reviews call for a rejection of this intervention and 
all, in fact, call for more exploration of its value to enhance IVF cycles.
It is not clear how the benefit is attained. Thus we further hypothesize that acupuncture stabilizes the mind-body 
interaction by [CONTACT_768447]-being of patients receiving IVF treatment.

The purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_768441] (prostacyclin and 
thromboxane) in women undergoing IVF therapy. The investigators’ overall hypotheses for this area of study, to be 
addressed with future research, are:  (1) acupuncture augments IVF success by [CONTACT_768446], and (2) acupuncture reduces the levels of stress and optimizes mind-body 
interaction in individuals undergoing IVF. 
Specific Aims:
(1) To measure the effects of acupuncture on key vasoactive urine molecules, i.e. prostacyclin and thromboxane, 
before and after acupuncture, and
(2)  to assess the impacts of acupuncture on the psychological well-being of women undergoing IVF treatment.
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY 
Results from the investigators’ study will shed light on the mechanism by [CONTACT_768452]. 
This may lead to other treatment strategies to improve success. Likewise, an established mechanism by [CONTACT_768453]-conventional treatment modality by [CONTACT_451330].
Research Design and Methods
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled study.  Participants will be women in the Principal Investigator’s practice 
seeking IVF.  Participants will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1054027] of care (no 
acupuncture) group.  Each group will have 3 study visits during their 8-week IVF cycle.
Rationale for the Control Group:
A sham control group is not used because systematic review suggested that sham acupuncture controls may 
unnecessarily complicate the RCT evidence base given the nature of objective outcomes in IVF study 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124624/). 
Power analysis
With 35 patients allocated to each group, assuming the Student’s T-test will be used to determine the differences 
between two independent samples, effect sizes d>0.6 will be found statistically significant with alpha .05 and power .80. 
In practical terms, since the PSS validation samples showed a mean about 13.5 with variance=6.2, only averaged 
differences greater than 1.5 raw score points in PSS will be found statistically significant. 
We plan to seek extramural funding in the future. We will use the data obtained from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_768442].
Inclusion criteria:
Women between ages 21-[ADDRESS_1054028] no 
contraindications to needle insertion. 
Exclusion criteria: 
Women currently using alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_768443], herbal supplements and meditation techniques will be 
excluded. Women with generalized psoriasis, neuropathy or coagulopathies posing increased risk due to needle insertion 
will also be excluded. Women must also agree not to take NSAIDs during their IVF treatment. Therefore women whom 
do not agree to avoid NSAIDs will be excluded from the study.

consecutively numbered sealed envelopes. 
Intervention
Acupuncture Protocol for treatment group
An acupuncture treatment protocol will be followed 
using a Delphi consensus process developed 
specifically for patients undergoing IVF (Smith CA 
, Grant S , Lyttleton J , Cochrane S . 2012) . This 
Delphi consensus protocol is developed by17 
international and national acupuncturists working in 
the fertility area.  The points and timing were 
carefully chosen based on acupuncturists’ 
experiences as well as research reviews. For 
instance, applying the third session of acupuncture 
on the day of transfer is supported by [CONTACT_768454] (Kang, 2011). 
Three semi-standardized sessions of manual 
acupuncture treatment will be administered during 
an IVF cycle including ET.  Each session will run 
about 30~[ADDRESS_1054029] treatment will be 
administered between days 6 through 8 of the 
stimulated IVF cycle, and will include core points ST29, CV4, CV6, SP6, SP10, plus up to 5 individualized additional 
points based on TCM pattern differentiation. The second treatment, prior to transfer on the day of embryo transfer, will 
use  points SP8, SP10, LR3, ST29, CV4 and one selected from HT7/PC6/YinTang (depending on presentation of 
women). The third treatment to be done post-embryo transfer (any time following ET but before the pregnancy test) will 
use points GV20, KD3, ST36, SP6, PC6). This visit will occur within a windowed timeframe (within [ADDRESS_1054030]-transfer on embryo transfer day) acknowledging the participant’s 
ability to return during that timeframe.  Main points are shown in Figure [ADDRESS_1054031] Acupuncture Point Locations 2008 version.    Up to 20 needles per session may be used. Disposable stainless-
steel acupuncture needles (0.16×15 mm, 0.18 ×30mm and 0.20X40mm, DBC Spring Ten, Korea) will be used.  Needles 
will be inserted manually to a depth varying from 10±5mm to 25±5 mm at the acupoints depending on the location and 
patient’s physical figure.  Needle retention time will be 25 minutes.

Auricular acupuncture using points Shenmen and Zigong only will be used on the day of ET. Needling sensation, De qi, 
is a composite of unique sensations interpreted as the flow of Qi or ‘the arrival of vital energy’.  De qi will be maintained 
with additional stimulation during the initial treatment on day 6–8, and during the pre-embryo treatment.
Control Group
The participants in the comparison group will continue their current usual IVF care at the Center for Fertility and 
Reproductive Surgery. Participants in the control group will also be asked to attend three study visits.  The first visit will 
take place between days 6-[ADDRESS_1054032]. This visit will occur within a 
windowed timeframe ([ADDRESS_1054033]-transfer on embryo transfer day) 
acknowledging the participant’s ability to return during that timeframe.  At the beginning and end of each study visit, 
participants will provide a urine sample.
 Study participants in this group will receive vouchers for [ADDRESS_1054034] to them. 
These vouchers will be provided on the day of the participant’s embryo transfer, or mailed to them after embryo transfer, 
and may be used beginning [ADDRESS_1054035]’s participation in this study will end.
For those subjects vouchers will be mailed to them after study visit 1 and will be valid beginning one year from study 
visit 1. The vouchers will then be valid for 1 year. (i.e., Control group embryo transfer on 6-1-15. Patient receives 3 
acupuncture vouchers that are valid 6-1-16 through 6-1-17). The delayed use of the acupuncture vouchers is intended to 
avoid use of the acupuncture sessions during pregnancy in the control group which could potentially affect outcome data 
comparisons between the two groups.  For the same reason, subjects will be asked to commit to abstaining from 
acupuncture for the same period of [ADDRESS_1054036]. 
Determination of Stable Metabolites of Prostacyclin and Thromboxane in the Urine 
Urine samples will be collected from all study participants prior to and after each acupuncture session for the treatment 
group, and before and after each study visit for the control group. Stable metabolites of thromboxane and prostacyclin, 2, 
3-dinor-TXB2 and 2, 3-dinor-6-keto-PGF 1α, respectively will be determined on a later date. Specifically, a mid-stream 
urine sample will be collected in a sterile wide-mouth container. A 10mL aliquot will be centrifuged (300x g) for 10 min 
and the supernatant kept at -20C until assay. Stable metabolites of prostacyclin and thromboxane will be determined 
using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol: TXB2 ELISA kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., 
http://www.biocompare.com/9956-Assay-Kit/1371009-TXBsub2sub-ELISA-kit/), Urinary prostacyclin ELISA kit (Enzo 
Life Sciences, Inc., http://www.enzolifesciences.com/ADI-900-025/urinary-prostacyclin-elisa-kit/). The specification of 
the kit shows that both kits have fairly high sensitivity. The lowest detection limits for TXB2 and prostacyclin 
metabolites are 10.54pg/mL and 6.58pg/mL, respectively. We plan to perform preliminary tests to determine the 
appropriate dilution of the samples before assay. In case the concentrations are below the detection limits, samples will 
be concentrated using a Centricon® Filter Concentrator (Millipore Co.). In case the above method cannot increase the 
concentration to within detectable ranges, GC/MS methodology will be used– we will consult collaborators (Ke-He 
Ruan, PhD, University of Houston) who determine prostacyclin and thromboxane metabolites using GC/MS on a routine 
basis.
Assessment of Self-Perceived Stress in Treatment and Control Group
To determine whether acupuncture contributes to stress reduction, study participants in the treatment group will 
complete the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, 1983 see Addendum) to assess self-perceived stress cycle days [ADDRESS_1054037]-embryo transfer, but before the

Potential Problems and Alternative Approaches
Recruitment
Patients at the Center for Fertility and Reproductive Surgery will be screened for eligibility by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Phy and [CONTACT_194879] 
and, if eligible invited to take part in this study. We do not anticipate any problem recruiting enough individuals to 
participate in the investigators’ study. The [LOCATION_007] Tech University Health Sciences Center, Center for Fertility & 
Reproductive Surgery currently performs approximately 70 IVF cycles per year. Even if 50% of patients participate in 
the study we have [ADDRESS_1054039] a poor response to initial medication stimulation (identified early in 
the treatment cycle, warranting cancelling and new medication plan) can continue to be in the study if they plan on 
having retrieval at a later date. The subjects would be re-consented if changes were made to the ICF since the time they 
were last consented to be in the study. There would be no new randomization done. The subject would continue with 
their last randomization number and their previous ID. The subject will proceed in the study and continue with the study 
procedure visits #1- 3 when they return for future IVF.
Enzyme immunoassay of metabolites of prostacyclin and thromboxane:
In case the concentrations are below the detection limits, samples will be concentrated using a Centricon® Filter 
Concentrator (Millipore Co.). In case the above method cannot increase the concentration to within detectable ranges, 
GC/MS methodology will be used. We have collaborators (Ke-He Ruan, Ph.D., University of Houston) who determine 
prostacyclin and thromboxane metabolites using GC/MS on a routine basis.
Psychological testing
We do not anticipate any problem administering psychological testing. One of the investigators is an experienced 
clinician. She administered the proposed test many times in her career.
Removal from study
In the event that embryo growth does not progress or implantation is cancelled for any reason, the subject’s participation 
in this study will end.

Risks
Participation in this study will not change the standard risks related to in vitro fertilization.  Those who are randomized 
to the experimental group will undergo acupuncture.  Acupuncture is generally considered safe when done by a trained 
professional.  Risks of acupuncture may include occasional dizziness, bleeding, bruising, and potential anxiety.  
However, women who undergo IVF will perform up to 80-100 subcutaneous and intramuscular injections on themselves 
by [CONTACT_768455]. Comparing to the bigger gauge (thicker hollow needle) of the syringe needles, 
discomfort caused by [CONTACT_768456] a much lower level.   Possible loss of confidentiality is a 
risk for all study participants, and will be mitigated by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-identifying all study data.
Benefits
Prior studies indicate a potential benefit of acupuncture on in vitro fertilization outcomes.  However, the mechanism of 
the benefit is unclear.  It is possible that taking part in this study will be of no benefit to the participant.
Confidentiality
Each subject will be assigned a unique identification number at the time of enrollment, and all data will be de-identified 
and labeled with the subjects’ ID number.  All de-identified data will be stored securely on encrypted devices accessible 
only to study investigators in accordance with TTUHSC policies.  
Projected Timeline
Historically, patients seeking infertility treatment with IVF are open-minded to alternative therapy to enhance success. 
The TTUHSC Center for Fertility and Reproductive Surgery currently performs 70 IVF cycles per year. With a projected 
recruitment of 50% of women undergoing IVF, we anticipate reaching the investigators’ goal of 70 subjects in a 2-year 
period.  
Significance or Innovation of Expected Research Outcome
Acupuncture shows promise in enhancing success rates in women undergoing IVF. However, without an established 
mechanism of action, it is difficult to encourage patients to accept the treatment. Furthermore, understanding the 
mechanism of acupuncture’s positive effect (i.e., increased vasoactive biomarkers and/or decreased perceived stress) 
may lead to the development of other treatment modalities to help infertile women. Finally, the general population may 
be more likely to accept this low-risk, affordable alternative treatment modality if we can provide a scientific explanation 
of the beneficial effects of acupuncture.

Addendum:
PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE by [CONTACT_768457] (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of  
stress.  It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one’s life are appraised as stressful.  Items were designed to  
tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives.  The scale also includes a number of  
direct queries about current levels of experienced stress.  The PSS was designed for use in community samples with at  
least a junior high school education.  The items are easy to understand, and the response alternatives are simple to grasp.  
Moreover, the questions are of a general nature and hence are relatively free of content specific to any subpopulation  
group.  The questions in the PSS ask about feelings and thoughts during the last month.  In each case, respondents are  
asked how often they felt a certain way.
Evidence for Validity:  Higher PSS scores were associated with (for example):
failure to quit smoking
failure among diabetics to control blood sugar levels
greater vulnerability to stressful life-event-elicited depressive symptoms
more colds
Health status relationship to PSS:  Cohen et al. (1988) show correlations with PSS and:  Stress Measures, Self-  
Reported Health and Health Services Measures, Health Behavior Measures, Smoking Status, Help Seeking Behavior.
Temporal Nature:  Because levels of appraised stress should be influenced by [CONTACT_768458], major events, and  
changes in copi[INVESTIGATOR_175815], predictive validity of the PSS is expected to fall off rapi[INVESTIGATOR_768444].
Scoring: PSS scores are obtained by [CONTACT_167069] (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 & 4 = 0) to the four positively  
stated items (items 4, 5, 7, & 8) and then summing across all scale items.  A short 4 item scale can be made from  
questions 2, 4, 5 and 10 of the PSS 10 item scale.
Norm Groups:  L. Harris Poll gathered information on 2,387 respondents in the U.S.

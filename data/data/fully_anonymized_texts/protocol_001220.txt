SPECIFIC AIMS  Aging is a major risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The incidence of AAA is highest in the elderly, and AAA rupture is the 13th leading cause of death among individuals aged 65–[ADDRESS_1067358] AAA growth or rupture. This is due to the unpredictable clinical behavior of AAA. In an autopsy study of 473 non-resected AAA, 40% of AAA between 7 cm and 10 cm had not ruptured, while nearly 13% of patients with aneurysms smaller than [ADDRESS_1067359] ultrasound (CEUS) using microbubbles has emerged as a method for imaging adventitial vasa vasorum (VV) in carotid plaques. We have an active CEUS program and have previously correlated VV density with neovascularization in an animal model, and have imaged 850 patients with carotid CEUS. CEUS can also be used to image AAA, since neovascularization and VV are commonly seen on AAA wall histology. Both may be markers of hypoxia and weakening of the aortic wall, and can be quantified with CEUS using time–signal intensity curve analysis to detect VV density in different regions of interest in the AAA wall.  Our goal is to non-invasively study the metabolic processes within the aortic wall that are thought to explain AAA growth and rupture, and their variation with age and gender. This process also affects unstable coronary and carotid disease, where the progression from an asymptomatic plaque to rupture and thrombosis, also known as “vulnerable plaque”, is not 
fully explained by [CONTACT_777167]. Similarly, localized hypoxia, neovascularization, and inflammation of the aortic wall are thought to contribute to degeneration of AAA, accounting for growth and possibly rupture that are otherwise not explained by [CONTACT_777168]. In addition, pro-inflammatory systemic biomarkers, such as interleukin, tumor necrosis factor-α; and matrix-degrading enzymes, are up regulated in patients with AAA suggesting a systemic inflammatory process. Non-invasively detecting AAA wall neovascularization using CEUS is a novel approach to evaluate aortic wall vulnerability. It could identify regional inflammation, and propensity for AAA wall weakening, enlargement or rupture. Our hypothesis is that increased neovascularization of the aortic wall correlates with AAA growth and rupture and is more pronounced in women. CEUS imaging of AAA, coupled with serum biomarker measurements, has the potential to identify the propensity for growth or rupture. The Specific Aims are:  Aim#1: Determine the relationship between AAA growth rate and VV density. Approach: prospective CEUS imaging of a cohort of patients with AAA 4-5.4cm in diameter at 6 month intervals for 18 months. Hypothesis: VV density on CEUS is increased in AAA at risk for growth.  Aim#2: To correlate CEUS findings with serum biomarkers. Approach: longitudinally measure AAA specific serum biomarkers with every CEUS. Hypothesis: Levels of pro-inflammatory serum biomarkers correlate with VV density and are more elevated in unstable AAA.  APPROACH  The study protocol was approved by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) of the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]. The study was funded by [CONTACT_777169] (SVS) foundation in addition to the National Institute of Health (NIH) through a R03 grant.  Study Design The objective of this study was to non-invasively study the metabolic processes within the aortic wall that are thought to explain aortic growth. This was a single center prospective evaluation of patients with an AAA diameter of at least 4.[ADDRESS_1067360] agent, Definity® (Lantheus). 1ml of the contrast agent was diluted in 9ml of normal saline to achieve a concentration of approximately 10 microliters/kg. For each injection sequence, 0.[ADDRESS_1067361] replenishment real time imaging. Two injection sequences were typi[INVESTIGATOR_380047]. Each CEUS evaluation took approximately 20-30 minute to complete. Patient’s heart rate, blood pressure and breathing were monitored during the examination and afterwards in the waiting area. The total monitoring time ranged between 30-90 minutes. Microbubble replenishment was analyzed using ImageJ (NIH) via manually drawn regions of the aortic wall and intraluminal thrombus (ILT) (Figure 1).  Ultrasound evaluation was performed using the GE US system (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, [LOCATION_003]) with the standard curved array abdominal transducer. The contrast settings on the ultrasound system were set to a low mechanical index of 0.[ADDRESS_1067362] and the location was recorded on a study sheet. Uptake was then separately recorded by [CONTACT_777170] (RC, PC). Care was taken to correlate with color flow duplex ultrasound to avoid lumbar and mesenteric vessels as well as artifact. The visualization of the microbubbles within the 
abdominal aortic aneurysm wall was defined as contrast uptake. This was determined by [CONTACT_777171] (The PI, RC and PC) for every single patient.  Uptake was quantified via video intensity analysis in a region of interest in the aortic adventitia. Background-subtracted peak video intensity, which has been shown to correlate with VV density, was derived and normalized to peak intensity in the lumen (Figure 2).9  Aneurysm growth, rupture and repair were recorded during the follow up period. Matched controls with no aneurysm disease underwent one-time CEUS and PIB testing using biomarker panels (Meso scale discovery) and Bioplex 100 analyzer (Bio-rad).  Biomarker testing Blood samples were withdrawn from patients at each visit and one year following AAA repair. Blood was drawn in the Vascular Surgery clinic by [CONTACT_16133]. Blood samples were banked and used for the measurement of biomarkers. This is the list of plasma inflammatory biomarkers that were tested: Osteoprotegerin (OPGN), Galectin 3, Cystatin C, Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), Uromodulin (UMOD), C-reactive protein (CRP), Macrophage migration inhibitory  factor (MIF), Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM1), Interferon γ (IFN-γ), Interleukin 10 (IL10), Interleukin 6 (IL6), Interleukin 8 (IL8), Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), Serum amyloid A (SAA), Vascular cell-adhesion molecule (VCAM1).  Statistical analysis plan: Sample size: No previous literature has reported the mean and standard deviation of AAA VV density measured in vivo by [CONTACT_777172]. Statistical analysis: Data will be summarized as mean and SD for continuous variables after testing for normality. Categorical data will be summarized with frequency and percentage. Correlation coefficients will be determined for the correlation of VV and microbubble density measured by [CONTACT_777172], as well as serum biomarkers with AAA growth. We will use linear regression to test the significance of such higher VV and microbubble density by [CONTACT_777173] (Aim1). We will include serum biomarkers in the modeling process. Adjustment for any 
demographics differences will be also attempted including age, gender and race. A p-value<0.05 will determine significance.  Anticipated findings and alternative approaches: We anticipate that this clinical research study will identify biomarker and CEUS differences in AAA adventitial VV density based on age, gender and AAA stability or growth. Our findings will support a larger clinical trial and future investigations of treatment paradigms of AAA based on biologic risk of growth or rupture instead of absolute diameter. If CEUS and biomarker differences are not detected during the study period in otherwise stable AAA, longer follow up with repeated imaging and biomarker testing at 6month intervals will be sought. If our hypothesis is not confirmed (i.e. differences in AAA wall neovascularization do not exist), imaging of AAA wall inflammation will be considered when available to human subjects using microbubbles targeted to either activated leucocytes or endothelial cell adhesion molecules that are upregulated in inflammation and mediate leukocyte recruitment and adhesion. If CEUS is not accurate given the depth of penetration of ultrasound, alternative imaging modalities such as IVUS or FDG-PET CT scanning will be explored. We anticipate that our results will identify active angiogenesis and ischemia of the AAA wall and biomarker predictors of growth, which may improve real time monitoring of AAA progression and response to systemic or targeted microbubble anti-angiogenesis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

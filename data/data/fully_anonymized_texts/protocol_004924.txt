PROTOCOL TITLE  
A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_579537]  
2/3/[ADDRESS_761314] aims to determine if enalapril is superior to nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_579538], unplanned medical visits and/or 
readmissions in women with hypertension in the postpartum period. Our 
hypothesis is that women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 
randomized to enalapril as their primary antihypertensive will require fewer 
resources in the postpartum period than women randomized to nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
 
 
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIF ICANCE  
Provide a brief paragraph summarizing prior experience important for understanding the 
proposed study and procedures. 
 
Hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy and the postpartum 
period and is responsible for a significant use of medical resources as women 
often require prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], unscheduled clinic visits and 
readmissions to control their blood pressure.  (Stevens 2012, Clapp 2016)  
Many women may require antihypertensives to control it. Currently, at 
Brigham  and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], we interchangeably use nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], enalapril 
and/or labetalol to control postpartum hypertension. We do not know which 
medication is best, especially at preventing the use of  extra medical 
resources. Nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_579539] d daily so likely patients are 
more able to comply with treatment. We theorize that the mechanism of 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, [ADDRESS_761315] suited for  patients with hypertension in pregnancy 
as there appears to be a dysregulation  of the renin-angiotensin -system. 
(Gant 1973)  
 
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
Briefly describe study design and anticipated enrollment, i.e., number of subjects to be enrolled 
by [CONTACT_17839] -wide and by [CONTACT_17840].  Provide a brief summary of the 
eligibility criteria (for example, age range, gender, medical condition).  Include any local site 
restrictions, for example, “Enrollment at Partners will be limited to adults although the sponsor’s 
protocol is open to both children and adults.”
 
This is an open-label randomized controlled trial in which participants will be 
randomized to receive  either  nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_579540]. Women who are pregnant or 
recently postpartum (within 6 weeks) with hypertension can be recruited for 
the study. They must also be at least 18 years old and planning to follow -up 
at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. They can be on no more than one 
antihypertensive and if they are, it must have been started in pregnancy. 
Women are not eligible for the study if they have any strict contraindications 
to nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], enalapril or labetalol or a history of failed treatment with any 
of those agents. Their creatinine during admission must be less than 1.5. 
There will be 45 women recruited to each arm  for a total of 90 women in the 
study . They will officially enter the trial once they are postpartum and their 
provider wants them to start or continue an antihypertensive.  
 
All women will be enrolled by [CONTACT_579551]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_579541]. All patients will give written consent and will be informed that a 
licensed physician investigator is available  to speak with them at any time 
during the consent process.  
 
Briefly describe study procedures.  Include any local site restrictions, for example, “Subjects 
enrolled at Partners will not participate in the pharmacokinetic po rtion of the study.”  Describe 
study endpoints.
 
Patients who participate in the study will be randomized to receive nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_579542]. The assigned 
antihypertensive should be titrated to control blood  pressure so that systolic 
blood pressure is consistently less than 150 mmHg and diastolic blood 
pressure is consistently less than 95 mmHg. If a patient reaches 90mg daily 
of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_283958] 40mg daily of enalapril without achieving this blood pressure 
goal or the patient’s provider believes the assigned agent (nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_579543]) is ineffective, labetalol 200mg twice daily should be added to the 
regimen. Patients will follow -up in clinic in one week after discharge and six 
weeks for blood pressure chec ks and to have basic metabolic panels drawn. 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, [ADDRESS_761316] visits for postpartum patients. The study will be over 
once the patient has had her six -week postpartum visit.  
 
The p atient may be contact[CONTACT_579552][INVESTIGATOR_579544] (which 
would influence the primary outcome).  
  
For studies involving treatment or diagnosis, provide information about standard of care at 
Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ from standard care.  
Provide information on available alternative treatments, procedures, or methods of diagnosis.
 
There is no consensus on the best antihypertensive to use during the 
postpartum period. Currently at BWH, providers usually choose to use 
nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], enalapril and/or labetalol to control postpartum hypertension  as 
they are effective and safe during breastfeeding . The study procedures differ 
from standard care only in that it is formally randomized and not provider 
dependent.  
 
There are alternative antihypertensives to use such as methyldopa  or 
clonidine  but these are rarely used at BWH.  
 
 
Describe how risks to subjects are minimized, for example, by [CONTACT_579553].
 
Risks to participants are minimized because the protocol is not deviating 
from standard care as we are giving medications that we would normally 
give in the postpartum period.  
 
Descr ibe explicitly the methods for ensuring the safety of subjects.  Provide objective criteria for 
removing a subject from the study, for example, objective criteria for worsening disease/lack of 
improvement and/or unacceptable adverse events.  The inclusion of objective drop criteria is 
especially important in studies designed with placebo control groups.
, 
Patients will be monitored closely in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_579545]. We will monitor their vital signs and any symptoms or side effects 
they may have. We would remove a patient from the study if she has an 
adverse reaction to any of the antihypertensives such as significant 
hypotension, uncontrollable hypertension or intolerance of the medication.  
We will follow -up with these patients one w eek after they are discharged 
from their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_579546].  
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, 2014    4  FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
Provide a brief description of any foreseeable risks and discomforts to subjects.  Include those 
related to drugs/devices/procedures being studied and/or administered/performed solely for 
research purposes.  In addition, include psychosocial risks, and risks related to privacy and 
confidentiality.  When applicable, describe risks to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_103152] n ursing infant.
 
There is always the risk that the antihypertensive to which a participant is 
randomized will not work to control blood pressure or cause side effects.  
 
We think there is minimal risk to our trial because these are all medications 
we routin ely use in the postpartum period. We plan to carefully monitor 
patient’s blood pressures and symptoms and providers will be able to titrate 
the antihypertensives and add additional antihypertensives if needed to 
control blood pressure.  
 
 
EXPECTED BENEFITS  
Describe both the expected benefits to individual subjects participating in the research and the 
importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the study.  Provide 
a brief, realistic summary of potential benef its to subjects, for example, “It is hoped that the 
treatment will result in a partial reduction in tumor size in at least 25% of the enrolled subjects.”  
Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients with the disease/condition being 
studied and/or society, e.g., through increased knowledge of human physiology or behavior, 
improved safety, or technological advances.  
 
Because this study is a randomized controlled trial, there is no direct benefit 
to individuals. Given the nature of the study we do not know if, and which 
treatment is better. Furthermore, the study is randomly allocated so there is 
an equal chance of the patient being in either treatment arm. However, i t is 
hoped that prescribing enalapril for postpartum women will decrease th e 
frequency that women have prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], unscheduled clinic 
visits, triage visits or readmissions in the postpartum p eriod by 30 
percentage points.  
 
This study will also ideally benefit women in the future. By [CONTACT_579554] (i.e. prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], unscheduled clinic visits, triage visi ts 
or readmissions), we will be able to help future patients by [CONTACT_579555]. In addition, we will add to the limited body of knowledge regarding 
the use of ACE inhibitors  in the postpartum period.  
 
EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS  
The risks and benefits of the research must be fairly distributed among the populations that stand 
to benefit from it.  No group of persons, for example, men, women , pregnant women, children, 
and minorities, should be categorically excluded from the research without a good scientific or 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, [ADDRESS_761317] an interpreter present.
 
 
 
For guidance, refer to the following Partners policy:

RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail the specific methodology that will be used to recruit subjects.  Specifically 
address how, when, where and by [CONTACT_94878].  Include any specific recruitment methods used to enhance recruitment of women 
and minorities.
Women will be enrolled from Labor and Delivery, the inpatient antepartum 
service or from the postpartum service. They will be identified by [CONTACT_579556].  The patient’s clinician will ask the patient 
permission to be approached by [CONTACT_2792]. Once permissi on 
granted, p atients  will be approached by [CONTACT_579557]. If patients are recruited while they are 
pregnant, they will not enter the trial until they are postpartum and need an 
antihypertensive. If pa tients are recruited while they are postpartum, they 
will enter the trial once they need an antihypertensive.  
 
 
Provide details of remuneration, when applicable.  Even when subjects may derive medical 
benefit from participat ion, it is often the case that extra hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], meals at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
parking fees or other inconveniences will result in additional out -of-pocket expenses related to 
study participation.  Investigators may wish to consider providing reimbursement f or such 
expenses when funding is available
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, 2014    6  Subjects will not be provided remuneration for participation in this study. 
Given that the study will occur in an admission and in routine postpartum 
visits,  there will be no extra hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], parking or meal s.

CONSENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail how, when, where, and by [CONTACT_17844], and the timing of consent 
(i.e., how long subjects will be given to consider participation).  For most studies involving more 
than minimal risk and all studies involving investigational drugs/devices, a licensed physician 
investigator must obtain informed consent.  When subjects are to be enrolled from among the 
investigators’ own patients, describe how the potential for coercion will be avoided.
Patients will be consented on Labor and Delivery or during an inpatient 
admission for antep artum or postpartum care by t he physician investigators. 
If a patient is still pregnant, she may consent to the study and will not 
formally be randomized until she is postpartum and her provider determines 
she needs an antihypertensive. If a patient is pos tpartum when she is 
consented, her provider may want to start antihypertensives shortly after 
she has been consented to the study. Therefore, pregnant patients may 
have several hours or days to decide if they want to participate in the study. 
Postpartum pa tients will likely have less than 1 hour  to decide if they want 
to be in the study if their provider wants to start antihypertensives  as it 
would be unsafe to delay treatment .  
 
If a patient is approached to be in the trial by [CONTACT_579558], there will be 
additional objective providers available from the inpatient Maternal Fetal 
Medicine team to talk with the potential participant about the study.

DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
Describe the plan for monitoring the data to ensure the safety of subjects.  The plan should 
include a brief description of (1) the safety and/or efficacy data that will be reviewed; (2) the 
planned frequency of review; and (3) who will be responsible for this review and for determining 
whether the research should be altered or stopped.  Include a brief description of any stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_94859], when appropriate.  Depending upon the risk, size and complexity of the 
study, the investigator, an expert g roup, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) or others might be assigned primary responsibility for this monitoring activity.        
 
NOTE: Regardless of data and safety monitoring plans by [CONTACT_17846], the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17782], safety, and welfare of subjects 
under his/her care.  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_579547]. We will not have a data safety co mmittee for this 
study given that we would not stop the study early because  we feel there is 
minimal increased risk from the study protocol. Serious adverse events 
(including but not limited to cardiovascular event s, severe allergic reaction, 
uncontrollabl e hypertension ) will be reviewed by [CONTACT_579559], Julian Robinson MD, and the study staff to ensure the outcome is 
not related to study protocol. [CONTACT_60966] will serve as a safety monitor 
during the study.  
 
 
Describe th e plan to be followed by [CONTACT_079]/study staff for review of adverse 
events experienced by [CONTACT_17847]/her care, and when applicable, for review of sponsor 
safety reports and DSMB reports.  Describe the plan for reporting adverse ev ents to the sponsor 
and the Partners’ IRB and, when applicable, for submitting sponsor safety reports and DSMB 
reports to the Partners’ IRBs.  When the investigator is also the sponsor of the IND/IDE, include 
the plan for reporting of adverse events to the  FDA and, when applicable, to investigators at 
other sites.

use of password -protected computer databases; training for research staff on the importance of 
confidentiality of data, and storing research records in  a secure location.   
 
NOTE: Additional measures, such as obtaining a Certificate of Confidentiality, should be 
considered and are strongly encouraged when the research involves the collection of sensitive 
data, such as sexual, criminal or i llegal behaviors.
 
Each subject will be deidentified and given a study number. This study 
number will be linked to the MRN within the REDCap  database but will be the 
only personal health identifier. The REDCap database will be limited only to 
study staff. This REDCap database has been used broadly within the 
Partners system as it is a password -protected database.

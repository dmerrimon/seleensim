Pulmonary Hypertension and Anastrozole Trial: (PHA NTOM)  Protocol V4.[ADDRESS_464725]  
 
 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by [CONTACT_371500]. Endothelial dysfunction and platelet aggregation cause 
vasoconstriction, mitogenesis, and thrombosis in the small muscular pulmonary arteries. Right -sided  heart failure ensues with severe limitation of exercise and eventual 
progression to death. While there are multiple FDA -approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_371468], these 
treatments are expensive, have multiple side effects, pose some inconvenience, and none are curative.  
From the earliest modern description, PAH has been re cognized as a “female” 
disease. Female sex is the strongest risk factor for idiopathic and heritable PAH. Connective tissue disease -associated PAH almost always occurs in women, and female 
sex is associated with a significantly increased risk of por topulmonary hypertension in 
patie nts wi th cirrhosis . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_371469] -old recognition of this sex predilection, 
surprisingly few human and experimental studies have focused on the mechanism of female sex in causing PAH and the use of treatment targeting sex hormones. While estrogen has tradi tionally been considered to protect from cardiovascular disease, the 
strong female sex predominance in PAH implicates estrogen or other sex hormones in the pathophysiology of the disease.  
 Aromatase converts androgens to estradiol (E2) in the periphery and is responsible for 
most of the E2 production in post -menopausal women and men. Our research group and 
others have performed several studies which suggest that aromatase and estrogen production may play an important role in the risk of PAH. Surprisingly, aromatase is present in the diseased small muscular pulmonary arteries of both experimental models 
and patients with PAH; anastrozole (AN) (an aromatase inhibitor) reversed pulmonary hypertension in these animal models . Finally, we have performed a small “ proof of 
concept” randomized clinical trial which showed that AN significantly increased the six 
minute walk distance at three months (RCT [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . AN is a generic drug which 
has been FDA -approved for breast cancer for [ADDRESS_464726]-menopausal women and men with PAH to determine whether AN may be  an 
effective treatment for PAH .

 Chapter 1. Background and Significance  
 
1.1 Definition and characterization of PAH  
 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure > 
25 mm  Hg, a pulmonary vascular resistance > 3 WU, and a normal pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_371470] . Endothelial 
thickening, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and in situ thrombosis are present in small 
pulmonary arteries, however the disease mechanism is unknown. The three year survival is only 60%.  
1.2 Traditional and novel concepts in hormonal effects on t he vasculature  
 
PAH is a rare disease; however it may affect up to 30,[ADDRESS_464727] shown that female sex has an odds r atio~4 for the presence of portopulmonary hypertension in patients with 
advanced liver disease. (1) E2 levels were more th an three times as high in women with 
PPHTN (18.6 pg/mL)(N = 14) as in female liver disease controls (4.9 pg/mL)(N = 43).( 2) 
Males showed similar results.  Every 1 ln increase in E2 is  associated with a 55x increase 
in the risk of PAH in men and more severe disease, including shorter 6MWD .(3)  
 We performed a candidate- gene association study for portopulmonary hypertension using 
the Pulmonary Vascular Complications of Liver Disease ( PVCLD)  study sample.( 2) Two 
promoter SNPs in the aromatase gene (CYP19A1) a nd several SNPs in the genes coding 
for estrogen receptor α (ESR1) were associated with the risk of PPHTN. The minor allele of rs7175922 was associated with significantly higher circulating E2 levels in our study population, demonstrating functional activi ty in producing E2 (or linkage to a functional 
SNP).  
 A research group in Scotland has recently published several studies showing the presence of aromatase and estrogen receptor α in the pulmonary arteries of female patients with PAH and in animal models of PAH. (4-7) They showed that the initiation of AN after th e 
establishment of PAH in the experimental models showed improvement in pulmonary 
artery pressure and RV morphology.( 5) 
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.[ADDRESS_464728] of AN 1 mg po 
qd for PAH showed that AN significantly reduced E2 by [CONTACT_3450] 40% but had no 
effect on testosterone, cortisol, or sex hormone binding globulin.( 8) AN did not have a 
significant effe ct on tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ( TAPSE ), however AN 
significantly increased the six minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) at 12 weeks compared to 
placebo  (median change of +26 meters in the AN group compared to median change of -
12 meters in the pla cebo group, p = 0.042) . AN had no significant effect on NT -proBNP 
levels, SF -[ADDRESS_464729] suggests that there was significant improvement in 
6MWD when compared to placebo.

 Chapter 2. Objectives and Specific Aims  
 
2.1 Objectives  This is a Phase II, multi- center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial to 
demonstrate the efficacy and safety of AN in subjects with PAH.  
 2.2 Specific Aims  
 
Primary Aim:  
 1.  To determine whether AN affects 6MWD at six months in subjects with PAH.  
 
Secondary Aims: 
 2. To determine whether AN affects 6MWD at three months and twelve months.  
3. To determine whether AN affects RV function , TAPSE  and other measures at six 
months and twelve months. 
4. To determine whether AN affects plasma NT -proBNP  level and other biomarkers 
at three months, six months and twelve months. 
5. To determine whether AN affects the SF -[ADDRESS_464730] a Phase III study  of this 
therapy. The primary end point of the trial (6MWD) will be assessed at six months to minimize missing data for this endpoint due to deaths, while other important secondary endpoints (such as safety, side effects, ef fect on TTCW) will be measured 
through twelve months, providing more patient-time on study drug to refine these estimates, neces sary to plan a Phase III study.

3.3 Randomization  
 
The Research Pharmacy at the University of Pennsylvania will prepare numbered drug kits containing 6 month supplies of AN or placebo and these  will be used sequentially. 
Randomization will be blocked and stratified by [CONTACT_4321] . Randomization will be 1:1 
AN:placebo.  
 3.[ADDRESS_464733]  is required to initiate appropriate therapy of an adverse event  
(AE) or if the safety of the subject  is at serious risk without knowledge of the treatment 
assignment. The  decision to unmask will be made by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_371471] (or co -
Chair) of the Steering Committee .  
 Unblinding may only occur for emergency purposes which would affect clinical care.  Investigators should note that the occurrence of a serious adverse event or progressive disease should not routinely precipi[INVESTIGATOR_267362]. Even with unblinding, the number of unblinded individuals should be limited to only those who need to know the treatment identity (e.g., only the local physician caring for the subject).  
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.[ADDRESS_464734] cancer who were randomized to either 
AN or placebo for several years.( 9) In this study, there was no significant difference 
between those receiving AN or placebo in terms of cardiac events or venous thrombosis. There was a higher risk of hypertension with AN (5%) compared to plac ebo (3%).  
Women taking AN had slightly increased risk of musculoskeletal side effects, like bone pain and joint stiffness, and also had an increased risk of hot flashes. Patients without osteoporosis had approximately 1% more loss in bone density with AN compared to patients receiving placebo.   In previous clinical trials of women with breast cancer who used AN, venous thromboembolism (blood clots) occurred in 1 to 3 of 100 women. The rate of myocardial infarction with long- term AN use was approximately 1%, and this risk was increased in 
women with pre -existing ischemic heart disease.  Serious AEs which happened in < 1 in 
10,000 subjects include skin reactions (lesions, ulcers, blisters), angioedema, and changes in liver function tests.  
 
Other common side effects listed in the package insert in women with breast cancer are weakness, joint aches, joint pain (stiffness or swelling/arthritis), pain, sore throat, high blood pressure, depression, nausea and vomiting, rash, back pain, sleep problems, bone pain, headache, swelling of legs, ankles or feet, increased cough, shortness of breath, lymphedema, and tickling, tingling or numbness of skin; however , it is unclear how these 
pertain to patients with PAH . 
 4.2 Placebos and study drug packaging  
 AN and  placebo tablets will be repackaged  by [CONTACT_371501]. At the Research Pharmacy, capsules will be packaged (100 tablets each) into white HDPE pharmaceutical vials with a tamper -evident liner and 
child -resistant cap .  Bottles will be fully labeled to meet state and FDA requirements, and 
packaged into labeled kits. There will be two  bottle s (6 month supply) of drug product 
dispensed to study subjects at the baseline study visit and at the [ADDRESS_464735] be stored at room temperature and protected from moisture. Subjects will be asked to bring bottles at the 3 -month, 6- month, and 12- month 
visits to allow for tracking of adherence and medication control. At the end of the study, after accountability has been completed and notification by [CONTACT_371502] (CCC) has been sent , study product can be destroyed at each Field Center’s 
Research Pharmacy.  
  
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.2                                                       
      
 16  
 4.3  Vitamin D supplement    
 
This study will provide vitamin D3 (2000 IU daily) which is the standard for bone protection in patients taking AN clinically .  
 The University of Pennsylvania Research Pharma cy will include vitamin D supplements 
to be taken with the study drug which is the standard of care to prevent bone loss with the use of aromatase inhibitors. Vitamin D  will be 1000unit tablets, 100 tablets per bottle . 
Vitamin D b ottles will the original manufacturer’s (no bottle alterations)  and be fully 
labeled for the study to meet state and FDA requirements, and packaged into labeled kits. There will be 4 bottle s of Vitamin D  (6 month supply) dispensed with the study drug to 
subjects at the baseline study visit and at the 6 month visit during the treatment phase. Vitamin D should be stored with study drug at room temperature and protected from moisture.  
 
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has defined the “tolerable upper intake level” (UL) for 
vitamin D as 100 micrograms (4000 international units) daily for healthy adults and 
children 9 to 18 years. Side effects of vitamin D are uncommon unless the 25(OH)D level 
becomes very elevated (>100  ng/mL or 250 mmol/L)  and the person is taking high dose 
calcium supplements.  
 The administration of vitamin D at the dose used in this study is well below the Institute of Medicine defined Safe Upper Limit, making the possibility of vitamin D intoxication highly unlikely. H owever, excessive vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalci uria, 
and kidney stones (but this is more common when combined with calcium supplementation).  4.[ADDRESS_464736] of care is unethical in PAH, considering the high risk of morbidity and mortality. In addition, new drugs should add incremental benefit to established therapi[INVESTIGATOR_371472]. The subjects’ 
pre-study medical regimen will therefore be continued after enrollment in the study. 
There will be no constraints on the management of the subjects’ PAH medications  during 
the study period. Treatment for poss ible side effects of  AN therapy will follow standard 
accepted clinical protocols  which will be unlikely to affect the primary and most 
secondary end points. Better understanding of the side effect profile of AN in patients with PAH is a primary objective of this study.

screening visit (Barium enema, Upper GI X -ray series, Lower Gi X -ray series, Nuclear 
medicine scan, or other test using contrast (dye) or radioactive materials.  If the answer is “yes” then the subject should be rescheduled for the screening visit as the DXA will not be able to be performed.

  5.3 Remote Study Visits (RSVs)  
 
Remote Study Visits (RSVs) may be performed instead of in-person visits while  
restrictions are in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Screening and Baseline visits (Visit 1) cannot be performed as RSVs. All visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_30240] -
meeting software  in a private space to ensure subject confidentiality.  
 
Prior to the RSV: 
The research coordinator will mail the SF -36 and emPHasis-10 questionnaires, actigraph, 
activity diary, and six minute walk materials (surveyor’s wheel/tape measure, flat markers to denote track length, pulse oximeter, timer if needed, Borg Score Card and 6MWT instructions) to the subject prior to the start of the visit window. The research coordinator will also call the subject at this time to remind the subject to start wearing the actigraph [ADDRESS_464761] when the walk will be performed. The PI (or Nurse Practitioner/physician study delegate as recorded on the Delegation of Authority Log) will confirm if the subject is medically stable to perform the 6MWT.  The research 
coordinator will call again 1-[ADDRESS_464762] of his/her phone or teleconference appointment.  
 The study PI (or appropriate delegate) will cont act the subject to complete an abbreviated 
physical exam (by [CONTACT_371505], such as to assess for edema), complete WHO functional class, and review common symptoms associated with anastrozole. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_371473] t he subject is able to perform the 6MWT 
remotely. This PI [INVESTIGATOR_371474], but should be performed prior to the remote 6MWT.  The subject can perform the 6MWT any day during the visit window following the PI [CONTACT_212648]. The subject will schedule the 6MWT  with the research coordinator to aid in 
executing the remote walk. The subject must have a companion that can assist with the remote walk in order for the remote walk to be performed. A wearable device (“wristwatch”)  utilizing the Global Positioning System (GPS)  to record distance may be 
supplied to be worn during the walk test along with a downloadable application  for a 
smartphone. Subjects who perform a remote walk will also be scheduled to do an in-person six minute walk test if restrictions in place are lifted within the visit window.  
 
During the RSV: 
• Review  SF-36, emPHasis-10 
• Review current medications  
• Abbreviated vital signs   
• Review of adverse events  
• Study drug accountability 
• Review the actigraph  and activity diary  
• Reinforce instructions on recording of new medications and dose changes

 27  
 • Reinforce instructions on how to take  study medication and to not throw away 
any empty/used medication bottles 
• Review instructions for 6MWT, if not already performed 
 
The study coordinator will call the subject at the scheduled time. The subject will complete the SF -[ADDRESS_464763]  will weigh himself or 
herself . The values will be read (or shown if videoconferencing) to the coordinator and 
recorded.  
 The research coordinator will schedule an in -person visit at the center if the center is re -
opening within the allowable visit window. The research blood draw, echocardiography, six minute walk test, and DXA will be done in- person . A visiting health servic e may be 
utilized to collect research blood and/or urine if the subject agrees. The research coordinator will thank the subject for their compliance with the RSV and reinforce compliance with the study medication and protocol.   
Study Drug for Remote Study Visits  
 Study drug and Vitamin D may be mailed to subjects if an in -person 6 Month Visit 
cannot be scheduled.  Additional study drug up to six weeks (42 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]) and vitamin D may be mailed to subjects at the [ADDRESS_464764] study assessment 
that is scheduled for the RSV Month 12 Visit.

5.5 Subjects’ retention and drug compliance  
 We will enforce subject retention in several ways. We will record extensive contact [CONTACT_341885]. This will include home, work, 
and cellular telephone numbers. The research coo rdinator will call before each study visit 
to remind the subject to attend. Subjects will be reimbursed for time at the clinic for 
research procedures for their participation in the study.  Subjects will receive $50 for the Screening Visit, $200 for the Ba seline Visit ($150 for the visit and $50 for returning 
actigraph equipment/diary)  and $250 ($200 each visit and $50 for returning actigraph 
equipment/diary at each visit ) for the remaining study visits (month 3, month 6, and 
month 12) for a total of $1000. Subjects may also receive additional reimbursement for travel expenses (e.g., hotel room and rideshares/taxis to make study visits).  
During RSVs, subjects will be compensated as follows:  
• Visit 2 ( Month 3) there will be no change in compensation ($200 for  completion 
of visit and $50 for returning the a ctigraph equipment/diary) regardless of 
whether or not subject retur ns to center for research blood and 6MWT  
• Visit 3 ( Month 6) - $100 for completing the remote visit, $100 for returning to the 
center to comp lete in-person assessments (echocardiogram, 6MWT, research 
blood, urine)  
• Visit 4 ( Month 12) - $100 for completing the remote visit, $100 for returning to 
the center to complete in -person assessments (echocardiogram, 6MWT, research 
blood, DXA scan)  
 
Subjects will be encouraged to attend all study visits at each visit.  The research coordinator and physician will explain the importance of compliance with the study protocol at each subject contact. If a subject fails to comply with a study visit, the coordinator will contact [CONTACT_267887]. If this fails, the coordinator will send 
two letters, one week apart, to request follow -up. 
 We have considered how to minimize nonadherence with therapy. We will strongly emphasize the importance of complying with the study drug treatment. Nonetheless, we will perform pi[INVESTIGATOR_371475].

 Chapter 6. Assessment of Efficacy and O utcome Measures  
 
6.1 Assessments of efficacy  Primary  The primary objectives of this study are to assess the effects of AN vs. placebo on the 6MWD at six months (primary end point) and to assess safety and side effects up to twelve months in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  Secondary  
There are several secondary objectives of this study. They include: 
• To assess the effect of AN  vs. placebo on 6MWD at additional time points (three 
months and twelve months). 
• To assess the effect of AN vs. placebo on RV function (TAPSE, and other measures ) 
at six months and twelve months. 
• To assess the effect of AN vs. placebo on plasma NT-proBNP level and other 
biomarkers at three months, six months and twelve months. 
• To assess the effect of AN vs. placebo on SF36 and emPHasis-10 at three months, six 
months and twelve months. 
• To assess the effect of AN vs. placebo on actigraphy- measured physical activity at 
three months, six months and twelve months. 
• To assess the effect of AN vs. placebo on TTCW at twelve months. 
• To assess the effect of AN vs. placebo on bone mineral density at twelve months.

 also perform  a 6MWT in -person at the clinic so that the remote data may be harmonized 
at the end of the study.  
 
6.2 Secondary outcome measures  
 
6.2.1 E chocardiographic measures  
 
We will assess right ventricular function ( TAPSE)  and other parameters as secondary 
endpoints. The ultimate determinant of outcome in subjects with PAH is right ventricular  
function, so we have focused on  metrics which are  predictor s of survival in PAH , 
including RV strain and qualitative RV function.   6.2.2 Plasma NT -pro BNP  and other biomarkers  
 Plasma NT -proBNP reflects right ventricular function in PAH and is a very strong 
predictor of outcome in PAH. This biomarker will be assessed at  baseline, 3 months, 6 
months and 12 months . For participants completing RSVs, these bioma rkers will be 
collected within the specified timeframe.  Sex hormones and other biomarkers will be 
assessed at the same time points.   
 6.2.3 Quality of life questionnaires ( SF36  & emPHasis –10)  
 The SF36 is one of the most widely used generic measures of subjective health status. 
The SF36 includes one multi -item scale that assesses eight health concepts: 1) limitations 
in physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical and emotional proble ms; 3) limitations in usual role activities 
because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5) general mental health (psychological distress and well -being); 6) limitations in usual role activities because of 
emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy and fatigue); and 8) general health perceptions. Subjects will complete the SF36 at baseline and each subsequent clinic visit during the therapy phase of the study. The em PHasis-10 is a pulmonary hypertension- specific 
questionnaire which is scored from 0- 50 (with higher scores indicating worse quality of 
life.) (14) 
 6.2.[ADDRESS_464768] s’ day -to-day lives.  
Actigraphy (or accelerometry) measures the amplitude and frequency of acceleration and 
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.2

 is particularly good at measuring locomotor movement, which comprises the bulk of 
activities for adults. Physical activity will be measured using the ActiGraph GT9X TM 
monitor, a lightweight device that contains a rechargeable lithium battery with a 
recording capacity of approximately 16 days. The device is water resistant with sustained 
performance after submersion at 1 meter for up to 30 minutes. All three axes provide 
activity counts to compute a composite vector magnitude (VM). Initialization and data 
download will be performed using the Actigraph software (Pensacola, FL).  
 
Subjects will beg in wearing the device on the day after the baseline visit  and will wear it 
for one week , and for one week periods before the three month, six month, and 12 month 
visits. Subjects will also complete an activity diary during the week of recording 
including the date and day of each week with hours of the day. Subjects will indicate 
when they are asleep, consumption of caffeine, medication administration and when they 
performed intentional exercise by [CONTACT_371506]. Actigraphs and 
activity diaries from the baseline visit will be shipped (using materials provided) back to 
the local study centers for data download after a week of wear . For other visits, the 
actigraph will be shipped to the subject  and the subject  will bring the actigraph with 
him/her to the study visit .  
 6.2.6 Time -to-clinical worsening  
 We hypothesize that AN  will increase the TTCW compared to placebo over twelve 
months.  TTCW is predicated on clinical events which are clearly meaningful (and undesirable) to subject s and clinicians (including starting parenteral therapy, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], lung transplantation, death) . This will be defined as the addition of new 
PAH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_371476], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371477]/or right -sided heart failure, lung 
transplantation, atrial septostomy, and cardiovascular and all -cause death.  
 
At each assessment, subject s will be questioned about hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371478]. Families and physicians of subject s who die during the 
study period will be interviewed by [CONTACT_756]. Research coordinators will obtain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2553], discharge summaries, and death certificates, which will be reviewed by [CONTACT_371507]. 
 Addition of PAH medication or increased doses of current PAH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_371479] (or subsequent) right 
heart failure. New PAH -specific medications added to the subjects’ medical regimen and 
the dates when added will be recorded during the st udy. Often, specific PAH medications 
which are administered at a stable dose have increased dosing with clinical worsening 
(specifically, prostacyclin analog therapy). All dose changes will therefore be recorded.  
  
 
  
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.2                                                       
      
 33  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371480] -sided heart failure 
 
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371481]/ or right -sided heart failure will be 
defined as a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371482]/or PAH 
symptoms (e.g., syncope) refractory to outpatient increases in dose or frequency of 
diuretics or specific PAH medications.  
 
We will record all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371483]. Records from each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371484]. Thes e records will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_371508].  Cardiovascular death  
 We will define a cardiovascular death as:  
1) Sudden death  
or  2) Death preceded by:  
 a) cardiogenic  shock (hypotension resulting in a failure to maintain normal renal or 
cerebral function for >15 minutes prior to death)  
or   b) heart failure symptoms or signs requiring:

 7.3 Stati stical procedures  
 7.3.1 Data analysis  
 
The intent -to-treat analysis will include all randomized subjects. Hypothesis testing will 
use two -sided α= 0.[ADDRESS_464770] deviation, and range, as appropriate. We will use contingency tables for discrete and dichotomous  
variables.  
 7.3.3 Analyses of treatment assignment and outcome measures  
 The primary analysis  of the primary end point  will compare the absolute change in 
6MWD from baseline with adjustment for baseline 6MWD and sex in linear regression models . 
 7.3.4 Ot her analyses  
 We will also consider longitudinal models of change from baseline  over the time of the 
trial.  Exploratory multivariate analyses will be performed incorporating all of the available endpoint assessments (baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months) in an ANCOVA model with ac tive treatment/placebo status as  the independent variable. 
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.[ADDRESS_464771] wishes to drop -out from the treatment phase of the study or has a serious 
adverse event (SAE) (whether related to study drugs or not), we will continue to follow -
up with the subject for study assessments to assist with safety monitoring and to avoid the problems introduced by [CONTACT_11368]. That is, if a su bject decides that he/she does not 
wish to continue taking the study drug(s), the subject will stop the investigational treatment, but will still be strongly encouraged to continue to follow -up with the study 
personnel for all scheduled study procedures (e .g., 6MWT, phlebotomy, 
echocardiography, etc.), so that missing data (and assumptions regarding these data) will be minimized.  The inclusion of such follow -up data will allow for analysis by [CONTACT_7586]-
to-treat.  
 
7.4 Sample size and power calculations   We will recruit a total of 84 patients with PAH with 1:[ADDRESS_464772] assumed a 10% loss to follow up rate at 6 months  and 
α = 0.05 (2- sided) for each end point.  
 For our primary outcome of the difference i n change in the 6MWD from baseline to six 
months, we have adequate power to detect an average difference of [ADDRESS_464773] in the study protocol, each site PI [INVESTIGATOR_371487] s IRB 
approval (and local IRB approvals , if required) is comp leted and available. The purpose 
of training is to ensure that study personnel are carrying out the protocol in a consistent way and are adhering to good clinical practice guidelines. Staff will have current Human Subjects Training Certification on file. B efore enrollment begins, study coordinators and 
research assistants who will perform the outcome assessments will be trained in all procedures, including completion of case- report forms (CRFs).  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_371488]. Surveillance for AEs will consist of questioning subjects about potential AEs at every study contact, having subjects report any adverse event to the study team, and having subjects undergo vital sign checks and physical exams during each study visit. Laboratories will be performed to ensure safety of initiating study drug and ten only as clinically indicated . 
 All study personnel are required to read the consent form, the protocol and the manual of procedures (MOP).  
 8.2 Data quality   The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_371489]. 
The data coordinating center (DCC) will create computer modules to identify 
discrepancies and incomplete data. These reports are tracked until each problem is 
resolved and corrected in the database.  
  
Periodic audits of each enrollment site will be conducted by [CONTACT_302303].  The monitoring 
staff will review database forms and source documents to ensure that the information on 
the forms is complete and consistent with the source documents. All consent forms be 
audited.  
      
 
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.[ADDRESS_464774]’s rights and responsibilities if they choose to participate in the trial and their 
right to refuse to participate.  It will be made clear that their clinical care will not be affected by [CONTACT_220862].  Subjects will be permitted to provide verbal consent over the phone  prior to being scheduled for a screening visit .  A consent script will be provided 
and documentation of verbal  consent  will be noted.  W ritten consent will be obtained  at 
the screening visit or before .   
 9.[ADDRESS_464775] process   The CCC and Field Centers will rely on a single IRB (sIRB) of record (University of 
Pennsylvania’s IRB)  and obtain approval and reliance agreements.  When s IRB approval  
is obtained, site specific ICFs  will be sent to the DCC along with the notice of approval . 
These materials must be on file in the DCC before a center can begin enrolling participants into th e clinical trial.  
 9.3 Laboratory values   
 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be measured at screening (or baseline) .  
 9.3.1 Hematology Complete blood count  with differential, including hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets . 
 9.3.2 Chemistry   
Basic metabolic panel including blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and calcium.   9.3.3 Liver Function Tests  
Hepatic panel including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and albumin.  9.3.4 Coagulation Studies  Prothrombin time, international normalized ratio (INR).

 9.4 Anastrozole -related laboratory abnormalities and drug interactions   
 In a study conducted in sixteen male volunteers, AN did not change the exposure and 
anticoagulant activity of both R - and S -warfarin. (15) AN increased total serum 
cholesterol in some studies, but di d not have an effect on low -density liproprotein levels 
in post -marketing studies. AN has interactions with tamoxifen and estrogen therapy; 
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.2

 however use of these medications and all hormone supplements (e.g., testosterone) will 
be exclusion criteria in the study.   
9.5. Dose Modification and Management of Potential Drug- related Adverse Events  
 
There are several common side effects of anastrozole therapy and generally accepted 
treatments which may be utilized.  
Hot Flashes  
Non-medical recommendations will include: 
• Staying well -hydrated.  
• Drink ice water or apply an ice pack at the onset of a hot flash.  
• Wear cotton or lightweight, breathable fabrics and dress in la yers. 
• Stay active.  
• Practicing  meditation or relaxation exercises to manage stress, which can be a 
trigger.  
• Avoiding triggers such as warm rooms, spi[INVESTIGATOR_84716], caffeinated beverages, and 
alcohol. 
Several medications have been shown to help with symptoms, including clonidine , low 
doses of antidepressants (such as venlafaxine and Prozac), and gabapentin.  
Muscle or Joint Pain/Aches and Headache 
This pain is caused mainly by [CONTACT_371510], which may be treated with 
acetaminophen or  a non- steroidal anti- inflammatory (NSAID), such as i buprofen, unless 
contraindicated (e.g., due to anticoagulation) . Studies have shown that acupuncture and 
gentle stretching and exercise may also help reduce this pain. 
Vaginal Dryness  
Vaginal dryness and re lated painful intercourse are some  of the more common side 
effects . Vaginal lubricants and can help with these effects and will be recommended.  
If subjects  are concerned about a symptom potentially related to trial medication, the study 
medication may be taken alternate days . Temporarily holding treatment is another option. 
Full treatment can be restarted after an a ppropriate interval (usually ~1 month ) or a decision 
about withdrawal can be made subsequently if symptoms persist. Treatment holidays can also 
be used in other special circumstances, but will be documented.  
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.2

 9.6 Safety and Adverse even ts  
 
9.6.1 Definitions  
 Unanticipated Problem (UP ): Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 1) unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
 2) related or possibly related to participation in the research (Possibly related to participation in the research means there is a reasonable possibility that the AE, 
experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459] ); and  
 3) suggests  that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.    
 Adverse event (AE) :  Any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or  worsens 
in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be 
regarded as AEs.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a ser ious AE  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_371511] (SAE):  Adverse reactions are classified as serious or  non- serious.  
A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event 
 Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in- subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341869].  
 
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.2                                                       
      
 41  
 All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious s hould be regarded as non -serious 
AEs.  
 
Suspected adverse reaction:  is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  For reporting purposes, "reasonable 
possibility" means there is evidence to sugges t a causal relationship between the 
drug/investigational product and the adverse event. 
 
Internal adverse event : Adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_371512](s) at their own Field Center.  
 
External adverse event : Adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_371513].   
 
9.6.2 Classifying AEs  
 Severity  
The intensity of the AE is classified according to the CTCAEv4.0.  Grade refers to the severity (intensity) of the AE:   
 If the intensity of an AE worsens during study drug administration, only the worst intensity should be reported on the AE page. If the AE lessens in intensity, no change in the severity is required.  
 
CTCAEv4 Grade 1 : mild ; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention is not indicated. 
CTCAEv4 Grade 2 : moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is 
indicated; limiting to age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL; 
instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], 
using the telephone, managing money, etc).  
CTCAEv4 Grade 3 : severe or medically significant but not immediately life 
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371490]; 
disabl ing; limiting to self -care ADL (self -care ADL refers to bathing, dressing 
and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).  
CTCAEv4 Grade 4 : life-threatening  consequences; urgent intervention is indicated.  
CTCAEv4 Grade 5 : death  due to an AE.  
 
In this grading system, severity is not equivalent to seriousness.  For example, a  SAE 
would be any event which was life -threatening or disabling (Grade 4) or fatal (Grade 5) 
or was moderate- severe (Grade 2 -3) and required or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 Expectedness  
 AEs must be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur or were unexpected, meaning not anticipated based on current knowledge found in the protocol, investigator brochure, product insert, or label.  
 
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.2                                                       
      
 42  
 Expected:  an AE known to be associated with the intervention or condition under study. 
 
OHRP defines an unexpected AE  as any AE occurring in one or more subjects 
participating in a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with either: 
1) the known or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the procedures involved in the research that are described in a) the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the 
current IRB -approved informed consent document, and b) other relevant sources 
of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or  
 
2)  the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition   of the subject( s) experiencing the AE and the subject’s predisposing risk factor 
profile for the AE.  
 Relatedness  
  1) Definite: the AE is clearly related to the  research procedures  
 2) Probably: the AE is likely related to the research procedures  
 3) Possible: the AE may be related to the research procedures  
 4) Unlikely: the AE is doubtfully related to the research procedures  
 5) Unrelated: the AE is clearly not related to the research procedures  
 
Possibly related to participation in the research: There is a reasonable possibility that 
the adverse event, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459].   
 
For each identified AE, an AE entry on the appropriate form will be completed  using the 
above classificatio ns as soon as possible, updating as necessary. Reporting procedures 
should be started immediately (within 24 hours) upon learning of a SAE  or UP .

administration of study treatment (w eek 54 phone call) .  
 Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.     
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.2                                                       
      
 43  
 General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an AE must also be recorded and documented as an AE.   Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Laboratories will not be drawn unless clinically indicated.  A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an AE if any one of the following conditions is 
met:  
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity 
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, disco ntinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371491] a serious AE unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an AE if the condition meets the criteria for an AE.  Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n, nor surgery are reported as an AE in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not  be reported as an 
outcome of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
 AEs and SAEs which do not fall under the expedited reporting procedure requirements will be reported  by [CONTACT_371514] s cheduled or ad hoc meetings upon request. The Field Center 
Investigator/designee should keep originals or photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_267855], including facsimile confirmations, and file them in the participant's file.  All Field Center Investigators should ensure that their sites report all routine AE(s) to ensure the CCC has accurate data for periodic or annual reporting requirements to the sIRB.

 Expedited reporting process  
 
Events will be reported to CC C within 24 hours of knowledge of the event using a 
required form or as a written report of the event (including a description of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follow -up/resolution and ne ed 
for revision to consent form and/or other study documentation).
 Copi[INVESTIGATOR_371492]’ study file and the Trial Master F ile(TMF)  maintained by [CONTACT_145859].  
The F ield C enter  Investigator is expected to provide as much of the following 
inform ation as is available: 
• Protocol name [CONTACT_114040] 
• Subject identifiers  
• Demographic data  
• Nature of the event  
• Severity of the event  
• Probable relationship (causality) of AE to study procedure 
• Date and time of AE onset  
• Date and time of AE resolution, if available  
• Concomitant medications that the participant was taking for an 
underlying medical condition or disease and the therapeutic agents 
used for the trea tment of the adverse event  
• Clinical assessment of participant conducted at time of SAE/AE  
• Results of any laboratory and/or diagnostic procedures, and 
treatment  
• Follow-up plan 
• Outcome 
• Autopsy findings (if appropriate) 
 The Field C enter Investigator will provide details about the AE to the CCC as they 
become available. If additional information cannot be obtained for whatever reason, this will be documented. The Field C enter Investigator should inform the CCC when no other 
information is expected. The  Field Center  Investigator should provide the CCC with a 
logical, complete, and accurate narrative description of the AE based upon the above information. The Field Center  Investigator should promptly determine an assessment of 
causality.   The CCC will report this information to the sIRB for initial assessment and subsequent reporting will occur as outlined on the table .  The sIRB will communicate to the CCC 
(and the local IRBs) if the event requires revisions to the informed consent form or other measures. The sIRB will work with the local IRB and CCC to determine if any corrective actions should be ini tiated as a result .  A formal determination will be provided to the 
sIRB within 1 business week and the CCC will inform all Field Center Investigators of 
the corrective action (e.g., revision of informed consent form, protocol, CRF). The CCC will also report any qualifying events to t he DSMB  and NHLBI  as noted in the schedule.

 Other Reportable events:  
 
The following events are also reportable to the sIRB : 
• Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents an unexpected SAE that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
• Any AE that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, protocol or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_941] s IRB to 
assure protection of human subjects.  
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of severity or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to treatment than initially expected.  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows tha t an arm of the research 
study is of no therapeutic value.  
• Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biologic used in a research protocol. 
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior s IRB revi ew to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to a research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study. 
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_371494], or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
 9.6.[ADDRESS_464777]’s best interest.  A subject should be withdrawn from the study if there is:  
 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Termination of the study by [CONTACT_456]  
• PI [INVESTIGATOR_371495] V4.[ADDRESS_464778] is 
withdrawn from the treatment portion of the protocol (either due to subject, physician, or 
investigator decision), it is imperative to continue with the scheduled follow -up 
assessments both for the safety of the subject and for completeness of data collection. This will be explained to potential subjects at the time of informed consent. The 
importance of compliance with study visits will be reinforced throughout the trial.  
 
In the event of clinical worsening, subjects will be continued on their assigned study medication. There is no strong evidence that the medication under study is effective in subjects with PAH, so that there is neither reason to unmask the study therapy nor to initiate treatment with AN in such subjects. If the subject develops an indication for AN therapy (such as breast cancer), the subject would be withdrawn from the treatment portion of the trial (but continue being assessed as per the trial protocol).  
 9.6.[ADDRESS_464779] will be considered, prior to the formal study unblinding, only if the following circumstances are met: 1) knowledge of the treatment assignment is required to initiate appropriate therapy for an AE or 2) if the safety of the subject is at serious risk if the treatment is continued without the knowledge of treatment assignment. The decision to unmask will be made by [CONTACT_371516] (or co -Chair) of the 
Steering  Committee . The DSMB must be notified of the decision as soon as possible.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_464780]  will be assigned a unique  Participant ID number  (PID) when 
his/her demographic and race/ethnicity information is entered for the first time. Follow -
up data are subsequently entered as needed when a subject  has a clinic visit. The unique 
PID number remains with each subject  permanently and is matched with all new data 
entered. The P ID number and subject  identifiers are directly linked in the study database.  
 The DCC at the University of Pennsylvania will also generate a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) for each subject using a NIH tool client. This is an identi fying code assigned to a 
single research participant so that data can be compi[INVESTIGATOR_371496] (PII), even if the data are collected at different locations or by [CONTACT_371517]. The GUID is c reated using PII (including, current name, 
legal given name [CONTACT_371521] (first, middle, and last), date of birth, city of birth, state of birth, country of birth, and physical sex at birth). Data including the GUID (without other identifiers) is conside red de -identified by [CONTACT_371518]. Personal identifying 
information used to generate the GUID will be erased by [CONTACT_371519].  
 The potential for data sharing has been included in the informed consent. Data releases to investigators for approved research purposes and analyses (after review and approval by [CONTACT_371520] s IRB and execution of a 
Data Use Agreement) will be stripped of identifiers using  a “Safe Harbor” approach. If an 
approved investigator has conducted a separate study in which a shared participant has 
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.2

 also consented to the use of a GUID then this will be retained in the data release; 
however, for all other data releases the GUID will b e removed.  
 Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  Several mechanisms will be in place to  maintain confidentiality. A ll of the data will be 
reported in aggregate. Each subject in all phases of the study will be assigned a unique study Participant Identification (PID)  number to be used on all data forms, study records, 
and blood samples. A list of subject  names and code numbers will be maintained 
separately in locked file cabinets or on password protected computers. Only the investigators and project staff will have access to this information. No other personally identifiable information will be available. We will also obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH for this study before consent of the first subject.  9.[ADDRESS_464781]. There is a risk of bruising, hematoma, and infection after phlebotomy, which are possible but not considered serious AEs. Fainting may occur but is unlikely. The removal of <50 cc of blood four times during one year is a potential risk; however this amount is routinely taken from subjects for clinical indications without adverse effect.   The 6MWT may cause light-headedness, chest pain, or musculoskeletal discomfort; however the risks of this study to subjects are minimal. In addition, subjects with PAH routinely undergo 6MWT for clinical indications, so this study procedure does not increase risk above usual clinical care. As subjects will be allowed to continue their other therapy, there are no alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_341873]. Remote six minute walk tests will be performed with a companion and the research coordinator observing to ensure subject safety.  
 
The risks associated with an echocardiogram are that the probe used on the chest during 
the echocardiogram may lead to mild soreness in the area for about a day. 
PHANTOM  Protocol V4.[ADDRESS_464782] ’s activity level. Wearing the actigraph may 
cause skin irritation.  There are no additional risks inherent to the recorder itself and 
subjects will be instructed to continue their activities in usual.  
 The wearable GPS (“wrist watch”) may cause skin irritation when wearing the device, but 
this is unlikely for the short period of testing (six minutes).    The administration of AN has been studied in women with and without  breast cancer. A 
recent study included 3,[ADDRESS_464783] cancer who were randomized to either 
AN or placebo for several years.( 9) In this study, there was no significant difference 
between those receiving AN or placebo in terms of cardiac events or venous thrombosis. There was a higher risk of hypertension with AN (5%) compared to placebo (3%).  Women taking AN had slightly increased risk of musculoskeletal side effects, like bone pain and joint stiffness, and also had an increased risk of hot flashes. Subject s without 
osteoporos is had approximately 1% more loss in bone density with AN compared to 
subject s receiving placebo.  
 In previous clinical trials of women with breast cancer who used AN, venous thromboembolism (blood clots) occurred in 1 to 3 of 100 women. The rate of myoca rdial 
infarction with long- term AN use was approximately 1%, and this risk was increased in 
women with pre -existing ischemic heart disease.  Serious AEs which happened in < 1 in 
10,000 subjects include skin reactions (lesions, ulcers, blisters), angioedema , and changes 
in liver function tests.  
 Other common side effects listed in the package insert in women with breast cancer are weakness, joint aches, joint pain (stiffness or swelling/arthritis), pain, sore throat, high blood pressure, depression, nausea a nd vomiting, rash, back pain, sleep problems, bone 
pain, headache, swelling of legs, ankles or feet, increased cough, shortness of breath, lymphedema, and tickling, tingling or numbness of skin; however, it is unclear how these pertain to subject s with PAH. 
 The administration of vitamin D at the dose used in this study is well below the Institute of Medicine’s defined Safe Upper Limit, however excessive vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and kidney stones (but this is more common when combi ned with calcium supplementation). 
 The other risk to the subjects is the potential loss of confidentiality during data collection.  
 9.9 Potential benefits  
 The results from the study could be applied in the future to subjects (including those in the study) who stand to benefit from the information. There may be clinical benefits to the use of AN in subjects with PAH. Future studies could be based on the resul ts of this

 study. As the study involves the risks of randomization to AN, phlebotomy, exercise 
testing, and loss of confidentiality, and there is a potential for future benefit for both subjects in the study and for future subjects, the risk/benefit ratio is favorable.  9.[ADDRESS_464784] of the study will be made in writing to the 
investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the NIH before commencement of this study.    All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and 
providing sufficient information for subjects  to make an informed decision about their 
participation in this study. This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_941] s IRB for the study (and to Field Center IRBs if necessary for 
local content review) .  The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent 
form, must be obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure.  The consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_17257], and the investigator -
designated research professional obtaining the consent.

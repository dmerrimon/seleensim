Brief Summary of Research (250 -400 words):  
The purpose  of this study  is to develop  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a culturally - and linguistically -tailored  health 
education intervention to increase breast cancer screening amongst Chinese immigrant women. 
The overall  goal is to promote  Chinese  women  to adhere  to 1- and 2-year screening  mammogram 
guidelines  and complete  follow -ups in a timely  manner.  Healthy  People  [ADDRESS_768746]  ~81% 
of screening eligible women undergo mammography; however, less than 61% of Chinese 
immigrant women across the U.S. meet screening guidelines. In [LOCATION_001] City (NYC), 
immigration from China has increased ~50% in the past two de cades. This rapid immigration 
makes NYC an ideal testing ground for investigating strategies to improve Chinese immigrant 
women’s  adherence  to screening  mammography.  Research  with Chinese  immigrants  in NYC  has 
revealed that only 23 -30% of women from this c ommunity had ever had a mammogram in their 
lifetime. This is a population with great need for increased access to breast cancer education and 
screening.  
The Health Belief Model (HBM) provides a framework for addressing cultural health barriers 
related to p reventive health care and cancer screening by [CONTACT_62310] a decision to 
engage in a health behavior is determined by [CONTACT_584684]. Health 
education programs addressing individual and community -level barriers developed  using HBM 
constructs,  specifically  the Witness  Project,  has successfully  increased  participants’  breast  cancer 
knowledge and mammography screening uptake. The evidence -based Witness Project  uses 
narrative communication (e.g., storytelling, personal testim onials) to educate, persuade, and 
engage target communities about cancer prevention and screening. The appeal and success of 
narrative communication stem from its familiarity as a basic mode of human interaction. Our 
work  in minority  and immigrant  communit ies has demonstrated  that narrative  communication  can 
increase  participation  in breast  cancer  screening.  However,  the efficacy  of these  interventions  has 
not been empi[INVESTIGATOR_584675]. By [CONTACT_584685] -level approaches, group -based narrative educational programs could play a 
significant  role in promoting  adoption  and repeat  use of breast  cancer  screening  amongst Chinese 
women.  
1) Objectives  
 
We seek to identify  cultural  beliefs  and attitudes  Chinese  immigrant  women  have  toward  breast 
cancer screening; and to utilize these findings to adapt and subsequently pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a narrative - 
based breast health education pr ogram for increasing screening mammograms in Chinese 
immigrant  women.  We hypothesize  that our culturally - and linguistically -adapted  breast  health 
education  program  will improve  screening  mammography  rates  in Chinese  immigrant  women.

interviews with community members (n=30) and gatekeepers/stakeholders (n=30) and draw 
from  our preliminary  work  and literature  review  to identify  and test components  of the Witness 
Project that should be adapted for Chinese immigrant women. Preferred language, English 
language  proficiency,  cultural  beliefs,  access  to health  care,  preferred  format  (group -based  vs. 
individual education), knowledge of breast cancer screening guidelines, and HBM predictors 
of screening behaviors will be  assessed.

Aim 2. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_584676] C hinese immigrant 
women. We will pi[INVESTIGATOR_584677] 12 programs (4 each in Cantonese, 
Mandarin, and English) to assess feasibility and acceptability and to determine effect sizes 
for a future large -scale trial. Receipt of screening ma mmography and intentions to undergo 
mammography, as well as other HBM constructs (i.e., perceived risk, barriers, fatalism, and 
breast cancer knowledge) will be compared in a pre -post test design stratified by [CONTACT_331505] 
(N=96).  
 
2) Background  
 
Although there are multiple social/environmental determinants of cancer screening, screening 
involves  an individual  deciding  whether  or not to engage  in the screening  behavior.48,49  The HBM 
asserts that an individual’s attitudes and beliefs (e.g., perceived benefits, perceived barriers) will 
determine their behavioral intentions.[ADDRESS_768748]  cancer  screening  uptake.  Health  decision -making  models  theorize  that decisions  about 
a behavior are a function of an individual’s perceptions of the expected utility (benefit -cost ratio) 
of the behavior and of other cognitive factors (e.g., self -efficacy, perceived risk).1-[ADDRESS_768749] settled elsewhere in 
the US.15-19 Studies conducted by [CONTACT_92709]20 and Chen et al.21 found that only 54 -67% of Chinese 
immigran t women in NYC had ever had a clinical breast exam and only 23% had ever completed 
a mammogram. Their studies also reported that English -speaking ability and greater years spent 
in the US were positive significant predictors of having undergone a clinical  breast

Study Number:  GCO [ADDRESS_768750] cancer screening  intentions.22-26 
Our preliminary work with Chinese women in NYC show that only 30% have had a 
mammogram in the past year and only 64% have had a mammogram within the past 2 year s 
(manuscript  under  review).  Because  we were  unable  to assess  years  in the US or immigrant  status 
in our preliminary work, we expect these numbers to be much lower for NYC Chinese women 
who are immigrants. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate the need for  education regarding 
breast cancer screening and adherence to screening mammogram guidelines within this 
population . 
We have  conducted  robust,  culturally -targeted  outreach  into several  minority  communities. 
The Witness Project (WP) is a community -based breast cancer education program designed to 
meet educational and cultural levels of underserved African American women. The WP model is 
a belief and theory -based intervention incorporating the HBM,  locus of control beliefs, social 
learning theory, transtheoretical model of change and the 4MAT System.27,[ADDRESS_768751] 
self-examination and a question and answer session concludes the program. Research by  [CONTACT_62312] 
(PI) et al. successfully replicated WP in [ADDRESS_768752] winning 
video, and training curriculum developed by [CONTACT_584686] (now on NCI Cancer Control 
Planet RTIP). In NYC, we conducted hundreds of programs at a variety of community sites and 
have educated over 3,000 participants.32-35 This research demonstrates our ability to reach 
culturally  targeted  members  in the communi ty and our experience  of over 15 years  in community - 
based  research.  
Development  of Esperanza  y Vida : A unique  aspect  of the Witness  Project  is the ability  to 
adapt the program to another culture as evidenced by [CONTACT_62314] y Vida (EyV). In 2003, Jandorf 
(PI) and colleagues initiated EyV to expand this breast educational program among  Latina 
populations in a culturally and linguistically congruent, community -based approach.33,34 EyV 
development was conducted with members of the target group, including qualitative studies, to 
ensure the adaptation would be culturally appropriate and meaningful.34-36 The social network 
characteristics  and language  preferences  (Spanish)  assessed  and integrated  into the intervention  to 
include such factors of where to present the programs (e.g. both community and faith -based 
locations)  and the need  to educate  men about  issues  related  to women’s  health.34,37  This successful 
replication and adaptation demonstrates our ability to adapt education programs through 
vigorous qualitative methods and pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124], as well as to address linguistic needs of different 
cultural  groups.

Study Number:  GCO [ADDRESS_768753] of presenting information because people 
communicate with each other and learn in everyday life primarily through stories.15 By [CONTACT_40397] a 
feeling of similarity to and identification with the communicator, narrative comm unication can 
increase  an individual’s  perceived  risk regarding  a particular  health  related  behavior.1 People  with 
personal experiences make credible, believable messengers. Additionally, narratives can be 
particularly  useful  for conveying  cancer  information  because  they reduce  counterarguments  which 
can help individuals overcome barriers to seeking treatment.40 Narratives also diminish negative 
feelings towards unknown, difficult, or frightening procedures (e.g., screening), provide role 
models fo r behavior change and create new attitudes that are based on cognition and emotion.[ADDRESS_768754] capabilities of narrative health communication are: “overcoming resistance, 
facilitating information processing, providing surrogate social connections, and  representing 
emotional and existential issues.”[ADDRESS_768755], 
foster identification with the communicator and lead to better engagement with the message; 
thereby [CONTACT_584687], increasing message recall, and promoting discussion with 
family members.39,[ADDRESS_768756] not been developed within the context of Chinese immigrants. 
However, one study with immigrant women in Canada suggests Chine se women might  be 
receptive to interventions involving narrative  stories.47 
Replicating  and expanding  the application  of this model  to Chinese  immigrant  women  will 
not only potentially improve the health outcomes of this population, but can also demonstrat e the 
effectiveness of the HBM in yet another minority population, increasing the robustness of this 
approach.

3) Setting of the Human  Research  
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, all interviews will be conducted over the phone and audio 
recorded so that we can create transcripts of the information. Participant recruitment, as well as 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_584679] 2 will be condu cted at community and faith - 
based partner sites, including, but not limited  to: 
 
Saint Margaret’s House: [ADDRESS_768768] Settlement: [ADDRESS_768769], [LOCATION_001], NY [ZIP_CODE]  
Chinese American Planning Council: [ADDRESS_768770], Brooklyn, NY [ZIP_CODE]  
 
 
4) Resources Available to Conduct the Human  Research  
Our team has successfully recruited Chinese -speaking participants into previous research (e.g., 
IRB-18-[ZIP_CODE]) and have demonstrated p rior recruitment rates of over 70% from immigrant and 
minority groups. The PI, Jandorf is a Professor and the Director of the Office of Community 
Engagement at the Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai. She is an expert in qualitative research 
and has over  [ADDRESS_768771] (and have provided a Letter of Support for this  proposal).  
Thus, we are confident that we will be able to identify and consent 60 eligible subjects (30 
community members and 30 gatekeepers/stakeholders) for qualitative interview calls for Aim 1.  
5) Study Design  
a) Recruitment  Methods

well-established collaborative relationships with gatekeepers from over 50 community 
organizations serving the Chinese immigrant community) and have successfully recruited 
Chines e immigrant women into prior studies (manuscripts under review), and therefore 
anticipate successful recruitment for this proposed research.  
For Aim 1:  
As we have done before, we will distribute IRB -approved flyers through various venues 
(e.g., at communit y sites, community newsletters, community listservs) and will ask partner 
site staff to identify/reach out to individuals who might be interested and share our contact 
[CONTACT_584689]. All participants will receive $[ADDRESS_768773] convenient for them. At this time, all aspects of 
the study will be explained and those interested in participating wi ll undergo the informed 
consent process. Signed consent will be captured electronically through the RedCap platform 
or via phone consent with a witness.  
 
 
b) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

f) Procedures Involved in the Human  Research  
For Aim 1, individuals  who consent  will be invited  to participate  in audio -recorded  interviews 
regarding Chinese immigrant women’s views and experiences with breast cancer screening, 
potential  barriers  and facilitators  to utilizing  screening  mammograms,  and beliefs  about breast 
cancer. Interviews are expected to last 45 -60 minutes. We will interview subjects at various 
times and days to accommodate their schedules (e.g., evenings, weekends) and in Cantonese, 
Mandarin,  or English,  as preferred.  All participants  will receive  a $[ADDRESS_768774] as an incentive 
for participating.

This study does not involve more than minimal risk to subjects.  
j) Withdrawal of  Subjects  
A subject may request to withdraw from the study at any time by [CONTACT_260565] (or if 
withdrawal occurs during the interview or educational pr ogram, the research assistant). The 
PI’s email and phone number will be provided to all participants prior to beginning the 
interviews or programs and will be listed on the consent forms.  
Procedures for Investigator to Withdraw Subjects:  
There are no antic ipated circumstances under which subjects will be withdrawn from the 
research without their consent.  
 
5) Risks to  Subjects  
Some participants may become stressed or anxious when thinking or discussing breast 
cancer, undergoing screening, and potential developm ent of breast cancer.  
 
To minimize  risk in our study,  research  personnel  will adhere  to a strict  protocol  developed  by 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -Is. Prior to starting the interview or program, research assistants will inform 
participants  of the potentially  sensitive  nature  of the topic  and remind  participants  of their right 
to withdraw from the study at any time or to decline to answer any questions that make them 
feel uncomfortable.  
6) Provisions for Research Related  Harm/Injury  
This study involves minimal risk to subjects.  
7) Potential Benefits to  Subjects  
Subjects might not derive any direct benefit from the research. However, possible benefits to 
subjects may be increased knowledge about breast cancer, breast health, and breast ca ncer 
screening.  
8) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of  Subjects  
Collected information will be stored on the department’s secured intranet drive. Following 
participation and after gift cards have been mailed/emailed to the subject, we will not need to 
keep any contact [CONTACT_584690].  
Confidentiality of each subject's information will be protected with utmost care. All subjects 
will be assigned a numeric code for record -keepi[INVESTIGATOR_24069]. A cross -referencing fil e 
containing identifying information and numeric codes will be password protected and stored 
on the Department’s secured intranet drive and will only be accessible to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_584682]. In addition, all data will kept in a file on the enc rypted on the Department’s 
intranet  drive.  Any and all physical  documents  with subject  information  will be kept in a locked 
file cabinet  in the PI’s office  at the Icahn  School  of Medicine  at Mount  Sinai  until they are

in a password -protected file accessible only to the study staff.  
9) Economic Impact on  Subjects  
There are no anticipated economic impact on the participants. We will provide subjects with a  
$[ADDRESS_768776] as a token of appreciation for their time.  
10) Payments to  Subjects  
Subjects will receive a $[ADDRESS_768777] as a token of appreciation for their time.  
11) Consent Process  
The standard “SOP HRP -090 Informed Consent Process for Research” will be utilized 
to obtain permission from subjects to participate in the research study.  
 
Eligible patients who are interested in the study will be provided with the informed co nsent 
form. Research assistants will go through the consent form with eligible patients and answer 
any questions. For Aim 1, informed consent will be conducted through the RedCap platform, 
modeled after the standard MSH informed consent form, or via phone consent with a witness, 
depending on patient preference.  
 
The consent form will explicitly state that the study involves research regarding Chinese 
immigrant  women’s  barriers  and facilitators  to breast  cancer  screening.  It will include  that risk 
to the pat ient is minimal. We will explain that data will be de -identified and kept encrypted 
and password protected. We will explain who and how to contact [CONTACT_584691]’  rights,  including  withdrawal  processes.  The 
consent will include a statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to participate will 
involve no penalty or decrease in benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, and that 
the subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to 
which the subject is otherwise  entitled.  
Children  
Children  will not be enrolled  in this study  because  children  are not routinely  screened  for breast 
cancer.  
Cognitively Impaired Adults – N/A 
English and Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese) speaking Chinese women will be 
allowed to participate in the study.  
 
12) Process to Document Consent in  Writing  
The standard PPHS consent template will be used, “SOP -091 Written Documentation of 
Consent.” For A im 1 participants, consent will be documented electronically via REDCap or 
over the phone with a witness, depending on participant preference.

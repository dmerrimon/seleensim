RISKS AND BENEFITS OF L APAROSCOPIC ANTI-R EFLUX SURGERY IN PATIENTS 
WITH I DIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS (WRAP-IPF):  A PHASE II CLINICAL TRIAL 
 
1. Su
mmary 
 
This protocol proposes to test the following hypothesis: Treatment with laparoscopic anti-
reflux surgery in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and abnormal 
gastroesophageal (GER) reflux will slow the decline of forced vital capacity (FVC) over [ADDRESS_197690] care (randomization 
ratio 1:1) . Subjects will be followed for 52 weeks or until the time of lung transplantation or 
death. 
 
2. Hypothesis and Specific Aims 
 
2.1. Study Hypothesis 
Our primary hypothesis is that the reduction of abnormal GER with laparoscopic anti-reflux 
surgery will slow the progression of IPF as measured by [CONTACT_169336]. We further hypothesize that 
laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery will reduce the frequency of acid reflux, will be safe and well 
tolerated, will improve symptoms and quality of life, and will reduce the incidence of acute 
exacerbation, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disease progression and death. Specifically, we will address 
the following aims: 
2.2. Specific Aim [ADDRESS_197691] of laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery on key secondary 
endpoints over 48 weeks in patients with IPF and abnormal GER. 
2.6. Specific Aim 5 
To identify molecular markers of IPF disease activity and gastroesophageal reflux in 
biological samples from patients with IPF and abnormal GER. 
 
 
3. Background and Significance 
 
 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease of unknown cause 
and increasing prevalence in the [LOCATION_002].1,2 An estimated 100,000 Americans will die 
from IPF this year, and aside from lung transplantation, which only 1% will receive, there is 
no FDA-approved therapy. 
Over the last decade, a potential role for gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in the progression 
of IPF has been suggested.3 This is based on several observations: First, it is clear that the 
overwhelming majority of patients with IPF have abnormal GER.4-[ADDRESS_197692] an increased benefit of 
Page 12 of 35 laparoscopic 
anti-reflux surgery over medical antacid therapy alone.9 Surgical treatment for 
GER with laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery reduces the incidence of all GER, both acid and 
non-acid; medical treatment for GER does not reduce the incidence of GER substantially – 
instead it simply reduces the acidity of the refluxate. Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery has 
been safely performed in patients with IPF and other forms of advanced lung disease 
awaiting lung transplantation.8,18,[ADDRESS_197693] recently recognized by [CONTACT_169337]/ERS/JRS/ALAT evidence-based guidelines committee authors and others.1,[ADDRESS_197694].  
 
 
4. Preliminary Studies 
 
4.1. Animal models 
Animal models show that both the acid and non-acid components of gastroesophageal 
refluxate are relevant. In one animal model of acute gastric acid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], widespread 
collagen deposition developed in the lungs within two weeks.15 In other animal models 
investigating chronic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_169313], and suggesting 
perhaps gastric contents (e.g. bile, pepsin, or food particulates) were responsible.16,17 These 
data support the concept that there are multiple components of the gastroesophageal 
refluxate (both acid and non-acid) that could contribute to ongoing alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_169314]. 
4.2. Retrospective data in patients with IPF 
Abnormal GER is highly prevalent in patients with IPF, with a reported 67-88% of patients 
demonstrating abnormal 24-hour pH monitoring.4-[ADDRESS_197695] study 
studied 65 consecutive patients with IPF regardless of symptoms or a pre-existing diagnosis 
of abnormal GER.5 All patients underwent 24 hour pH monitoring and esophageal 
manometry testing. The prevalence of abnormal GER was 87%, with 63% demonstrating 
abnormal reflux into the proximal esophagus. Only 47% of patients had classic GER 
symptoms of heartburn and dyspepsia. Manometry was largely within normal limits. These 
and other data have led investigators to hypothesize that abnormal GER might contribute to 
the progression of IPF through predisposing patients to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_169315] 13 of 35 refl
uxate that in turn causes chronic stress to the alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].3 A small case series of 
four patients demonstrated relative stabilization of forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusion 
capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) with medical therapy for GER.[ADDRESS_197696] for lung transplantation that did not 
undergo laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery.8  
Retrospective data from a cohort of IPF patients followed as part of a clinical trials 
consortium demonstrated a reduction in the rate of decline in FVC over 30 weeks for 
subjects taking anti-acid therapy.21 Additional retrospective data from the University of 
[LOCATION_004] San Francisco and the Mayo Clinic, [COMPANY_002]ster demonstrated that a history of 
laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery was associated with prolonged survival time in patients with 
IPF (Figure 1).9 Medical therapy (mostly with proton pump inhibitor (PPI)) appeared less 
effective. These data are limited by [CONTACT_169338], but support the hypothesis 
that treatment of abnormal GER in IPF slows progression of disease, and that laparoscopic 
anti-reflux surgery is more effective that medical therapy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 14 patients with progressive IPF (mean age 63 years, mean FVC 66 percent 
predicted (range 40-99%)) and abnormal GER who underwent laparoscopic anti-reflux 
surgery at University of Washington had pre- and post-surgical FVC measurements 
obtained (Figure 2) . FVC was assessed prior to the surgery (mean of 105 days prior to anti-
reflux surgery) and post-surgery (mean of 115 days following the anti-reflux surgery ). Over 

Page [ADDRESS_197697]-anti-reflux surgery assessments, the 
mean FVC increased by 0.08L (3.5 percent predicted) and the majority of participants 
(10/14) experienced an increase in FVC. All patients were discharged after the standard one 
night of post-operative observation without any medical or surgical complications. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Methods 
 
5.1. Inclusion Criteria 
Only subjects with confirmed IPF , abnormal GER on 24-hour pH monitoring (as defined by a 
DeMeester score of > 14.7) and esophageal manometry that is acceptable for full 
laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery will be eligible for this study . Subjects must be able to 
provide informed consent and be willing to undergo laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery. 
 
5.2. Diagnosis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis 
Subjects will be evaluated for IPF at the enrolling center . Study investigators will follow the 
most current ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT evidence-based guidelines in making this determination. 
 
A subject with suspected interstitial lung disease (ILD) should be evaluated for secondary 
causes including, but not limited to, environmental exposures, drugs, and systemic 
diseases. Presence of any of these findings felt to be significant enough to cause an ILD 
should disqualify the subject from entry into the trial.

5.4 Study Design and Study Visits 
 
Subjects who appear to meet entry criteria will review the informed consent (a written 
description of the purpose, procedures, and risks of the study) with the principal investigator 
(PI), co-investigator, or study coordinator, and all questions will be answered. The informed 
consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_169339]. No 
protocol-specific procedures will be performed until the subject has signed and dated an 
informed consent form. This includes the screening procedures .  
 
Page 16 of 35 The en
rollment visit should occur within 90 days of the screening visit.   However, it is 
preferred that the enrollment visit occur within 28 days of the screening visit to avoid 
repeating procedures. 
 
All follow- up study visits will occur within 10 business days of their designation (e.g. week 12 
will occur +/- 10 business days from the week 12 timepoint).

Page 18 of 35 At sc
reening, all potential subjects will undergo a complete medical history, physical 
examination and testing (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (performed pre-bronchodilator), arterial blood gas, GER 
symptom questionnaire, and 6 minute walk testing) with assessment of eligibility according 
to the inclusion and exclusion criteria . All potential subjects who meet entry criteria based on 
these assessments will undergo 24-hour pH testing and esophageal manometry, unless 
these procedures have been performed within 6 months of the enrollment visit (Visit 2) at 
the study site in accordance with the study protocol.  
 
Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will return for an enrollment visit within 90 days (but 
preferably within 28 days), and will complete baseline evaluations as outlined in this 
protocol, including: 
 Physical examination 
 Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) 
 High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) (unless performed in the past 3 
months according to study protocol and available for review and databasing) 
 Patient reported outcome questionnaires 
o UCSD Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD SOBQ) 
o St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ) 
o Cough visual analog scale (VAS) 
o ICECAP-O 
o EuroQOL EQ- 5D 
 Blood collection (5 tsp) for measurement of biomarkers 
 
If the enrollment visit occurs within [ADDRESS_197702] (6MWT) will be recorded as the baseline values.  If the subject is 
unable to return for enrollment until more than [ADDRESS_197703] medical 
care. 
 
Subjects randomized to anti-reflux surgery will undergo additional evaluations as directed by 
[CONTACT_27241] (these may include but are not limited to esophagram, endoscopy, and 
echocardiography) and will have pre-surgical evaluation by [CONTACT_14091] . These subjects 
Page [ADDRESS_197704]’s insurance (all other study procedures will be paid for by [CONTACT_1758]). 
In the unlikely event that a randomized subject is denied authorization, the subject will not 
have surgery but will be followed on an intention to treat basis. All subjects in the surgical 
arm will receive a bronchoscopy at the time of surgery. Bronchoscopy is a separate 
procedure from the surgical intervention. Bronchoscopy will be performed according to 
standardized protocol and samples (BAL and endobronchial brushings) will be collected . 
These patients will then undergo surgery according to study protocol (see section 8) . They 
will have a post-operative visit with the surgeon at approximately 2 weeks to ensure 
appropriate recovery. 
 
Subjects randomized to no surgery will be followed clinically. If there is evidence of 
significant disease progression (defined by a relative decline in FVC of ≥ 10% over 24 
weeks or longer), these patients will be allowed to undergo laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery 
as part of the clinical trial. These patients will otherwise complete the study visits as 
scheduled. 
 
All subjects in the study will be provided with a home spi[INVESTIGATOR_169317]. Subjects who are randomized to 
surgery will be instructed to halt daily spi[INVESTIGATOR_169318] [ADDRESS_197705] the option after study completion to 
keep the home spi[INVESTIGATOR_169319]. 
 
Safety assessments: Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_169340] (months 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11) and at week 52.  The 
calls should visits will occur within 10 business days of their designation (e.g. month 1 will 
occur +/- 10 business days from the month 1 timepoint). One month is defined as [ADDRESS_197706]’s vital status and asking questions 
about serious adverse events or adverse events related to the surgical procedure, for 
subjects randomized to surgery.    
 
Page 20 of 35 At w
eeks 12, 24, and 36, and 48, subjects will return for evaluation . Each visit will include: 
 Physical examination 
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] 
 DLCO (except week 36) 
 Arterial blood gas (ABG) measurement (except week 36) 
 6MWT (except week 36) 
 Patient reported outcome questionnaires (USCD SOBQ, SGRQ, Cough VAS , 
ICECAP-O, EuroQOL EQ- 5D) 
 GER questionnaire (at weeks 24, and 48 only) 
 Manometry and 24-hour pH testing (at week 24 only, and for subjects randomized to 
surgery only) 
 Blood collection (5 tsp) for measurement of biomarkers 
 HRCT (at week 48 only) 
 Bronchoscopy with collection of samples (at week [ADDRESS_197707] consented to the procedure). This procedure will 
be performed in an outpatient setting.  
 
At week 52, or 4 weeks after the final study visit, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_169341] (SAEs). 
 
Study staff may make a long-term follow up at one or more times after subjects complete the 
study visits to request additional information or talk to subjects about clinical or research 
issues that are relevant to patients with IPF.  
 
If a subject withdraws early from the study, s/he will be asked to return to complete the 
battery of assessments scheduled at week 48.  
5.5 Travel Reimbursement 
Subjects participating in this study will be eligible to receive up to $250 per study visit for 
covered costs associated with travel to study visits.  Covered costs may include: 
 Mileage (round-trip from the subject’s home address to the study clinic) 
 Parking fees at the study clinic 
 Airfare to and from the study clinic 
 Hotel costs 
 Taxi fare 
Page 21 of 35 Sites w
ill reimburse subjects as necessary, and submit documentation of payment to the 
Data Coordinating Center for reimbursement of these expenses. 
 
Subjects who are screened and enrolled on consecutive days and stay overnight for these 
visits can be reimbursed for two study visits (screening and enrollment) – up to $500. 
5.6. Recruitment Procedures 
 
Subjects recruited for this study will be physician-referred or self-referred to centers 
participating in this study.  
 
Clinical center subjects previously diagnosed with IPF will be notified of the trials by [CONTACT_169342]. 
 
Recruitment of minorities and women will be monitored by [CONTACT_36909] 
(DCC) and Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). If necessary, additional recruitment 
efforts will be made at specific centers to ensure that the aggregate subject sample contains 
appropriate representation of women and minorities.

6.3. Definition of Disease Progression 
Disease progression is defined as one or more of the following: relative decline in FVC of ≥ 
10%; increase in UCSD SOBQ of ≥ 5 points; suspected or definite acute exacerbation; 
death. Subjects and their treating physician will be notified of disease progression 
documented during the course of the study. 
 
6.4 Definition of Acute Exacerbations 
 
Both definite and suspected acute exacerbations of IPF will be identified. The following 4 
criteria will define definite AEx in subjects with acute exacerbation of IPF: 
 
1. Unexplained worsening or development of dyspnea within 30 days 
2. High-resolution computed tomography with new bilateral ground glass abnormality 
and/or consolidation superimposed on a background UIP pattern 
3. No evidence of pulmonary infection by [CONTACT_169344][INVESTIGATOR_169320]. 
4. Exclusion of alternative causes including heart failure, pulmonary embolism, or an 
identifiable cause of acute lung injury.

-- Pneumothorax 
-- Unknown cause 
-- Non-pulmonary cause (e.g. anxiety) 
 
If “unknown cause” is selected by [CONTACT_6962], further categorization as follows will 
be required: 
 
-- Definite acute exacerbation (meets protocol criteria in section 6.4) 
-- Suspected acute exacerbation as defined in section 6.4. 
-- Unclassifiable 
 
 
An AEx will be treated at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
 
7. Policies and procedures for identifying, reviewing, and reporting adverse events  
 
 
7.1 Definitions 
 
Page 24 of 35 Adverse 
event (AE) means any unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, 
including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research. 
 
Serious adverse event (SAE)  means any event temporally associated with the subject’s 
participation in research that meets any of the following criteria: 
• results in death; 
• is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred); 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 
In addition, important medical events that may be considered an SAE if they require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 
An Unexpected SAE is an SAE that the nature or severity of which is not expected from the 
disease or interventions within the clinical trial. 
 
An AE Associated with Research means there is a reasonable possibility that the AE may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_169345] (including tests) in the clinical trial. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_197709] the coordinating center to 
inform them of the SAE within 1 business day of knowledge of the event. The site should 
also submit an SAE form via the eCRF system  within 1 business day of knowledge of the 
event.  
 
The clinical center investigator will provide an assessment of causality of the event to the 
study intervention (i.e. is it an SAE associated with research) based upon the information 
available at the time of the report. It is understood that complete information about the event 
may not be known at the time the initial report is submitted, though investigators should 
make every effort to obtain information. All events submitted without a causality assessment 
Page 25 of 35 will be considered “associated with research” until a clarification is made. The investigator 
must also sign each SAE form. 
 
The clinical center investigator must enter follow-up information (e.g., diagnosis, outcome, 
and results of specific investigations) as it becomes available. Follow-up should be 
submitted according to the same process used for reporting the initial event as described 
above (i.e. within 1 business day of knowledge). All SAE s will be followed until resolution, 
stabi
lization, or the event r eturns to baseline condition or value, whichever occurs first. 
Investigators are responsible for reporting SAEs to their local IRB in accordance with local 
guidelines. The coordinating center will be responsible for tracking all SAEs, performing a 
clinical  review of the SAE data, querying the clinical centers for additional data, and 
following unresolved SAEs. 
 
AE Reporting 
This study intends to capture information on all serious adverse events, acute exacerbations 
as described in section 6.5, as well as non-serious adverse events related to the surgical 
intervention.  Non-serious, non-surgery related adverse events should not be reported. 
 
The DCC will submit a detailed report of pre -specified AEs of interest and all SAEs monthly 
to NHLBI and DSMB chair. In addition, each SAE will be reported to NHLBI and DSMB chair 
by [CONTACT_169346] . The DSMB Chair will review the 
information presented and determine if any additional information is needed, and/or a DSMB 
teleconference should be held. Guidelines for the DSMB procedures will be detailed in the 
DSMB charter.  
 
8. Surgical Intervention 
 
 
Subjects randomized to laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery will undergo preoperative 
evaluation by [CONTACT_169347]. This will include a standard pre-
operative surgical assessment, anesthesia clearance, and other testing as medically 
indicated. During surgery, standard American Society of Anesthesiologists protocols will be 
used to monitor patients under general anesthesia. All subjects will be mechanically 
ventilated using the minimal tidal volumes and supplemental oxygen required to maintain 
adequate gas exchange. All subjects who undergo laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery will have 
Page [ADDRESS_197710]-opera
tive visit to insure appropriate recovery. There will be no scheduled study 
procedures during this visit.  
Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery generally involves the following steps. Individual patient 
issues may require modifications depending on the surgeon’s intraoperative assessment. All 
efforts will be made to adhere exactly to the same surgical procedure, but if needed, the 
surgical team can deviate from the standardized protocol to ensure the safety of the patient 
and to achieve maximum beneficial results. Completion or modification of each stage will be 
documented in the clinical research form. 
Step 1: Division of gastrohepatic ligament; identification of right crus of the diaphragm and 
posterior vagus nerve .  
Step 2: Division of peritoneum and phreno-esophageal membrane above esophagus; 
identification of the left crus of diaphragm and anterior vagus nerve. 
Step 3: Division of short gastric vessels .  
Step 4: Creation of a window between gastric fundus, esophagus, and diaphragmatic crura. 
Step 5: Placement of Penrose drain around the esophagus .  
Step 6: Closure of crura. 
Step 7: Insertion of the bougie into esophagus and through esophageal junction. 
Step 8: Wrappi[INVESTIGATOR_169325]. 
Step 9: Final inspection, removal of instruments and trocars from the abdomen, and closure 
of the port sites.  
 
9. Data Management 
 
9.1. Design and Development 
 
The DCC will be responsible for development of the electronic case report forms (eCRFs), 
development and validation of the clinical study database, ensuring data integrity, and 
Page [ADDRESS_197711] data entry at the study clinical centers into the 
EDC system(s) provided by [CONTACT_15791] . A data collection worksheet will be provided to clinical 
centers for recording data in the event the EDC system is unavailable .  Data entry of the 
eCRFs should be completed according to the instructions provided and project specific 
training .  The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate, complete and up- to-date 
records, and for ensuring the completion of the eCRFs for each research participant.  
 
9.3. Data Acquisition and Entry 
 
Data entry into eCRFs shall be performed by [CONTACT_4539] . Selected eCRFs may 
also require the investigator’s written signature [CONTACT_169352], as appropriate. 
Electronic CRFs will be monitored for completeness, accuracy, and attention to detail during 
the study.  
 
9.4. Data Center Responsibilities 
 
The DCC will 1) develop a data management plan and will conduct data management 
activities, 2) provide final eCRFs for the collection of all data required by [CONTACT_1758], 3) 
develop data dictionaries for each eCRF that will comprehensively define each data 
element, 4) conduct ongoing data monitoring activities on study data, 5) monitor any 
preliminary analysis data clean-up activities, and 6) rigorously monitor final study data clean 
up. 
 
9.5. Data Editing 
 
Completed data will be entered into the DCC automated data acquisition and management 
system . If incomplete or inaccurate data are found, a data clarification request will be 
Page 28 of 35 gener
ated and distributed to clinical centers for a response . Clinical centers will resolve data 
inconsistencies and errors and enter all corrections and changes into the DCC automated 
data acquisition and management system. 
 
9.6. Training 
 
The training plan for clinical center staff includes provisions for training on assessments, 
eCRF completion guidelines, data management procedures, and the use of computerized 
systems. 
 
 
10. Data Analysis 
 
10.1. Sample Size Determination and Randomization 
 
We are planning to enroll approximately 58 subjects randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_197712] care. Patients will be allocated using a 
computer generated randomization scheme. Due to the unblinded nature of the study 
intervention, the randomization will not be stratified. If enough subjects randomized to 
surgery are unable to undergo surgery due to failure of insurance authorization or medical 
eligibility reasons, consideration will be given to rebalancing and/or adjusting randomization 
to insure sufficient subjects undergo surgery to meet the aims of the study. 
 
In powering the study, we have considered the potential impact of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_169326] (part of standard medical care) on the rate of FVC change in the no surgery group . 
Under the assumption that the use of PPIs will be partly effective, our statistical power will 
be reduced. Based on historical knowledge of change in FVC over time in patients with IPF 
a difference of [ADDRESS_197713] conservatively estimated that 40% of 
individuals in the no surgery group will take PPIs on a regular basis for control of typi[INVESTIGATOR_169327] (i.e. heartburn and dyspepsia), and that PPIs are 50% as effective as 
surgery in reducing the rate of decline in FVC over time. With these adjustments, the 
expected effect size is reduced to 0.[ADDRESS_197714] deviations (or approximately 0.20 liters) in 
Page 29 of 35 the cha
nge in FVC between the two groups with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and 80% power. 
The estimated number of subjects required for varying effect size and power are shown in 
Table 3. These calculations are based on the two-sample t-test with an increase in the 
sample size to allow for up to 10% withdrawal of consent .  
Table 3: Enrollment requirements for varying effect size and power  
Total subjects  Effect size  Two-sided alpha  Power  
38 1.0 0.05 80% 
52 1.0 0.05 90% 
58 0.8 0.05 80% 
76 0.8 0.05 90% 
100 0.6 0.05 80% 
134 0.6 0.05 90% 
*Calculations allow for 10% withdrawal of consent. 
10.2. Specification of the Primary Analysis 
 
The primary endpoint will be change in FVC (in liters) from baseline to 48 weeks. A mixed 
model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis, will be used to compare differences in the FVC 
measurements across treatment groups at [ADDRESS_197715] estimates of differences between treatments (along with confidence intervals) will 
be used to estimate the treatment effect. The validity of this model in terms of meeting 
modeling assumptions will be assessed via standard modeling diagnostics and goodness-
of-fit measures. The MMRM models will be implemented using PROC MIXED in SAS. For 
subjects randomized to no surgery who subsequently undergo surgery as part of the study 
(per protocol), post-surgical FVC measurements will be obtained but will not be included in 
the assessment of the primary endpoint. Instead, a [ADDRESS_197716] (DSMB) comprised of experts in lung 
disease and clinical trials, GER, laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery, and biostatistics who are 
not involved in any other way with this study will be responsible for monitoring the clinical 
trial for the duration of this award. A chair of the DSMB will be identified who will be 
responsible as the point of contact [CONTACT_169348]-related matters. Written documentation of no 
conflict of interest will be required. Prior to enrollment, the DSMB will review and approve 
the study protocol and other documents as appropriate. The DSMB will meet prior to the 
start of enrollment and at intervals as defined in the DSMB charter to review the safety and 
conduct of the study procedures, in particular laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery, as well as the 
following additional duties: 
1. Evaluate the progress of the trial, including assessment of recruitment and retention 
rates, data quality and timeliness, and participant risk versus benefit (including reviewing  
all significant adverse events). 
2. Consider factors external to the clinical trial that may have an impact on the safety of the 
participants or the ethics of the trial (e.g. an approved therapy for IPF becomes 
available). 
3. Assist in the resolution of concerns or problems expressed by [CONTACT_169349]. 
4. Report on the safety and progress of the trial on a twice-yearly schedule. 
5. Make recommendations to the NHLBI, the principal investigators, and if required other 
organizations concerning the continuation, termination, or other modifications to the trial 
based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study. 
Specific guidance regarding stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_169328]. 
6. Request the data-coordinating center to conduct interim analyses of the data to perform 
the above duties. 
7. Insure the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring. 
Page [ADDRESS_197717] (HIPAA) 
Considerations 
 
Subject confidentiality will be protected throughout the study. All subject data will be kept 
strictly confidential, and no subject-identifying information will be released to anyone outside 
the project. Confidentiality will be assured through several mechanisms. First, each subject 
will be assigned a unique study ID number, which will then be used on all study forms. 
Second, any study forms, blood samples, and paper records that contain subject information 
(eg, address lists and phone lists) will be kept at the clinical sites in secured, locked areas, 
coded by [CONTACT_32221]. Once blood or bronchoscopy samples are collected, there will be 
no subject identifiers placed on the samples—only the study ID number and the date of 
sample collection will be identified. Third, access to all subject data and information, 
including laboratory specimens, will be restricted to authorized personnel. In the case of 
computerized data, this restricted access will be assured through user logon IDs and 
password protection. 
 
At the DCC only authorized personnel will have access to the study data files containing 
study data. Security will be assured through user logon IDs, passwords, and appropriate 
access privileges. Personal identifying information, such as name, address, and Social 
Security number, will not be entered into the DCC database. Subject-specific data reported 
to the Steering Committee will be identified by [CONTACT_169350]. 
 
Finally, subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_169351], nor will the data 
be presented in such a way that the identity of individual subjects can be inferred. Analysis

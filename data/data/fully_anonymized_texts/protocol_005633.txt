 1.      BACKGROUND  
1.1           PATHOPHYSIOLOGY  
Retinitis Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802] (RP) is the term used for a genetically heterogeneous  group of inherited retinal 
degenerations  caused by a mutation in  one of the many genes which cause rod photoreceptors to die. 
Photoreceptors are cells in the retina that are stimulated by [CONTACT_60230], initiating the translation of visual 
images into nerve impulses that travel to the brain. There are two types of photoreceptors, rods and 
cones.  Rods enable vision in dim illumination ; cones are responsible for more detailed central vision, 
vision in bright light, and perception of color.  The vast majority (95%) of  photoreceptors are rods.  
 
Rods are the major consumers of oxygen in the retina and the loss of rods causes an increase in the 
tissue oxygen level in the outer retina. [1] This activates NADPH oxidase causing accumulation of 
superoxide radicals in the cytosol  [2] and also increases their generation in mitochondria of cones.  The 
excess superoxide radicals overwhelm superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and SOD2 and cause a chain 
reaction by [CONTACT_647832], such as hydr oxyl radicals and peroxynitrite. [3] The free radicals attack proteins, 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and DNA causing specific modifications that indicate that oxidative damage has occurred.  The 
most common modification to proteins from oxidative damage is the formation of carbonyl adducts .[4, 
5] Measurements of these markers of oxidative damage provide a quantitative assessment of the amount 
of oxidative damage that has occurred in a tissue.[ 6]  These modifications can impair the function of 
macromolecules and while there are endogenous repair processes, they are overwhelmed by [CONTACT_647833]. After rods are eliminated 
from the photoreceptor layer, oxidative stress in the outer retina is severe and leads to gradual cone cell 
death usually starting in the midperiphery where cone density is low and then spreading peripherally  and 
posteriorly .[7-9] The posterior spread of cone death results in visual field constriction and eventually a 
central island of vision and its elimination causes blindness.    
Clinical signs of RP include pi[INVESTIGATOR_647826], often around blood vessels and 
characterized as “bone spi[INVESTIGATOR_647827]- like pi[INVESTIGATOR_371]”, constriction of retinal vessels, and optic disc pallor.  
Spectral domain optical coherence tomography can show thinning of the retina in areas of photoreceptor cell loss and with segmentation the loss is s een in the outer nuclear layer.  Visual field testing shows 
constriction of the visual fields and electroretinography  show s reduced a - and b- wave amplitudes.  .

 1.1          STUDY RATIONALE  
 
Retinitis Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802] (RP) is a devastating eye disease and at present  there are no known treatment 
options that can alter the rate of vision loss and eventual blindness. In a series of studies  in animal 
models , the effects of exposing cones in the periphery of the retina to a large excess of oxygen  results in 
progressive oxidative damage to cone photoreceptors and cone cell death.[ 2, 3, 7- 11]  Cone cel l death  
gradually spreads from the periphery of the retina  toward its center, narrowing t he visual field and 
eventually resulting in tunnel vision.  C ompared to control patients, those with RP showed significant 
reduction in the reduced to oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG)  in aqueous humor and a significant 
increase in protein carbonyl content .[12] This demonstration of oxidative stress and oxidative damage in 
the eyes of patients with RP , suggests that oxidative damage -induced cone cell death in animal models 
of RP may translate to humans with RP and support the hyp othese s that (1) potent antioxidants will 
promote cone survival and function in patients with RP and (2) aqueous GSH/GSSG ratio and carbonyl 
content on proteins  provide useful biomarkers  of disease activity  in this patient population. Orally 
administered N -Acetyl cysteine (NAC) has been found to be a particularly effective antioxidant that 
promotes prolonged cone survival and maintenance of cone function in a mouse model of RP. [13] Since 
oral and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_647828] -term treatment in humans, and NAC has a 
good safety profile, there is good rationale to test the effect of NAC in patients with RP. The first step is 
to do test different dosing regimens  to identify the lowest dose that is able restore aqueous GSH/GSSG 
ratio and reduce carbonyl adducts on aqueous proteins.   
Oxidative damage has been implicated in several diseases including cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. NAC also has a mucolytic effect which 
makes it particularly useful for treatment of these pulmonary diseases. The effect of oral NAC has been 
tested in these indications in several clinical trials providing extensive safety  data. In COPD, NAC 
600mg bid improves airway function and reduces the frequency of acute exacerbations .[14, 15]  Doses of 
up to 1800mg/day have been well -tolerated in the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. [16]  
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) toxicity is treated with a loading dose of 140 mg/kg NAC followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 17 doses.[ 17] Normal volunteers  tolerated a dose of 11.2 grams  NAC/day for 
three months without any serious undes irable effects [18] and in another study a dose of 500mg/kg/day 
was tolerated .[19] The most fr equent adverse events associated with the oral administration of NAC are 
6 
 gastrointestinal in nature and include vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, abdominal pain and nausea  
(incidence rate > 1/1000 to <1/100) . Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock and 
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction  (incidence rate <1/10,000) , dyspn ea, bronchospasm  (incidence rate 
>1/10,000 to <1/1000) , angioedema, tachycardia, urticaria, rash and pruritus (incidence rate >1/1000 to 
<1/100) have been reported less frequently . Finally, reports of headache, tinnitus, pyrexia, blood 
pressure decreased  (incidence rate > 1/1000 to <1/100) , face edema and hemorrhage have also been 
collected with oral NAC.  In this study, we will u se NAC 600 mg effervescent tablets which are 
generally more pleasant and more tolerable than large capsules; however, because the formulation 
contains sodium, we will exclude patients with uncontrolled arterial hypertension defined as diastolic 
blood press ure > 95 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure > 160 mm Hg.  
 In patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, polymorphisms within the TOLLIP  gene were found to 
influence outcomes of NAC -treated patients. [20] The product of the TOLLIP  gene, toll -interacting 
protein, is an inhibitory adaptor protein acting downstream of toll -like receptors, mediators of innate and 
adaptive immunity. The identification of the influence of TOLLIP  polymorphisms on the effect of NAC 
in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis provides rationale for collecting DNA and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_647829]. In addition to this candidate gene genetic analysis, we plan to collect and bank patient RNA for future transcriptome analysis. The rationale for this is to identify gene expression 
changes that modify disease progression in RP. There is substantial variability in rate of progression 
among patients with RP. A patient who loses all vision early in life can have a sibling with the same 
mutation who maintains vision into advanced age. This suggests that modifier genes can have a major impact on cone survival. We hypothesize that  level of expression of  gene products that contribute to the 
antioxidant defense system  may influence cone cell death and hence th e rate of  loss of visual field. It is 
also possible that gene expression differences may  contribute to differences in response to NAC. For 
these reasons we plan to  collect RNA from patients which will allow us to do next generation 
sequencing in the future to under stand the transcriptome background on which our intervention has been 
performed. This is an ambitious undertaking that will require additional funding, but it is critical to plan 
for it and collect the samples as part of this protocol. Also, while it is no t critical to know the pathogenic 
mutation in each patient for our intervention that is directed at cone survival, the rate of rod cell death influences the rate of cone cell death  and it may be useful to know the underlying mutation in each of 
our patient s. The underlying mutation may be known in some patients who enter the trial, but it is not a 
[ADDRESS_867608] DNA to 
enable future genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_647830]. These studies are not part of the 
current study and will require additional funding, but it is important to obtain and store the samples for future use.  
 
2.     OBJECTIVES  
2.1           Primary Objectives  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of  N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in patients with RP  
2.2           Secondary Objectives  
• To measure the change from baseline aqueous GSH/GSS G ratio and protein carbonyl content . 
• To measure change from baseline cen tral retinal sensitivity by [CONTACT_486690].  
• To measur e change from baseline spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD -OCT).  
• To genotype TOLLIP  SNPs  
• To collect samples for future genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_647831].  
 
3.     STUDY DESIGN 
3.          DESCRIPTION OF THE S TUDY 
This study is a phase [ADDRESS_867609] a high carbonyl content ( >0.6) and a 
reduced GSH/GSSG ratio ( <3.0) in  the aqueous. Subjects with RP who don’t have a high carbonyl 
content ( >0.6) and a reduced GSH/GSSG ratio ( <3.0) but otherwise are good candidates for the study 
will be enrolled in the exploratory arm.  The reason for this stratification is that the primary  outcome  is 
the change from baseline carbonyl content and GSH/GSSG caused by [CONTACT_647834].  In a previous study, 17 of 20 patients with RP fit these criteria, so we 
anticipate that 8- 9 subjects in each cohort will be in the  experimental group.  We do not want to 
8 
 completely exclude RP patients who do not fit these criteria, because they may exper ience substantial 
decrease in carbonyl content  and substantial increase in GSH/GSSG and their inclusion in the 
exploratory arm will help to determine if patients who do not fit the criteria should be excluded from the 
next trial, a longer trial with a func tional endpoint.  
 Baseline testing will include: (1)  detailed medical and ophthalmological history , (2) measurement of 
vital signs ( 3) slit lamp  examination, ( 4) funduscopic exami nation, ( 5) best -corrected visual acuity 
(BCVA), (6) MP1 and MAIA  microperimetry , (7) SD-OCT , and (8) ultrawide angle fundus 
photographs . One eye will be selected as the study eye and an anterior chamber t ap will done for 
measurement of GSH/GSS G and protein carbonyl content . Serum  GSH/GSS G, protein carbonyl content  
and bilirubin levels  will also be measured .  Blood will be obtained for RNA and DNA samples. The 
following is the dosing of NAC 600 mg effervescent tablets in each cohort .

4.3           DOSING AND DOSE ESCALATION  
This is a dose -escalation study in which 6 doses of NAC effervescent tablets are being tested: 600mg 
bid, 600mg tid, 1200mg bid, 1200mg tid, 1800mg bid and 1800mg tid. P atients will be given the 
dose pre-determined for the cohort they enter upon  enrollment. The most common side effect of 
NAC is nausea and vomiting. If a patient cannot tolerate the assigned dose of NAC due to nausea 
and/or vomiting, the dose will be reduced to the dose immediately below the current dose. If that 
dose cannot be tolerated, the dose will be reduced to the next lowest level. This will be done until a 
tolerated dose is identified and the patient will be maintained on that dose throughout the trial. If a 
patient cannot  tolera te the starting dose of 600m g bid, they will be reduced to 600mg qd.  If a pat ient 
cannot tolerate a dose of [ADDRESS_867616] 5 subjects in a 
cohort or a total of 5 subjects are unable to tolerate a particular  dose of NAC, no additional subjects 
will be treated with that dose and the dose immediately below it will be designated the maximum tolerated dose. All subsequent subjects enrolled in the study will be treated with the maximum 
tolerated dose.

 4.4          STUDY DISCONTINUATIO N 
The Wilmer Eye Institute may terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating the study may 
include the following:  
• The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to  subjects  
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory  
 4.5 STATISTICAL METHODS  
     4.5.1          Safety  Analysi s 
The primary outcome measure is the safety and tolerability of N -acetyl cysteine (NAC) in patients with RP . 
Adverse events and results of ocular examinations from all 30 patients will be utilized to summarize safety data.  
The number and percentage of patients with treatment emergent adverse events (i.e. started or increased in 
severity after the patient received study treatment and incl udes abnormal lab results etc) will be summarised. 
The adverse events recorded prior to NAC administration will not be summarised and will be separated from 
the adverse events that are recorded post NAC administration in the final listings.  
 
     4.5.2          Secondary Analysi s 
To measure the change from baseline aqueous and serum carbonyl content and GSH/GSS G ratio at 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 months after initiation of NAC  treatment  and correlate it with changes in 
BCVA, retinal sensitivity, and ellipsoid zone (EZ) width.  
4.5.3           Power Analysis  
Power analysis was conducted and  a sample size of 30 was found to achieve 89% power to detect a 
mean of paired difference of 50% in aqueous carbonyl content with an estimated standard deviation 
of 0.8 and with significance level of 0.05 (95% confidence interval) using a [ADDRESS_867617]. 
     4.5.4          Missing Data 
Analyses of efficacy and safety will be based on available cases without imputation for missing  
values.  
     4.5.5         Interim An alysi s 
18 
 No formal schedule of interim analyses is planned.  Reports of adverse events from this study may 
be reviewed and summarized periodically while the study is ongoing to ensure the safety of subjects.   
4.5.6        Early Termination  and Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects withdrawn from the study prior to completion will be asked to return for an end of 
treatment assessment visit (all study procedures on the EOT assessment visit will be similar to those 
conducted on the month 9 visit) and the 3 months observational period. Subjects who are terminated 
prior to the week 24 visit will be replaced.  
 
4.6           DATA QUALITY ASSURANC E 
• Accurate, consistent, and reliable data will be ensured through the use of standard practices and procedures.     
 
5.     ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
5.1          ADVERSE EVENTS  
For this protocol, an AE is any “on study” untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign,  symptom, disease, 
syndrome, intercurrent illness) that occurs in a study subject, regardless of the suspected cause.  
Unchanged, chronic conditions are NOT AEs and should not be recorded on the AE pages of the CRF.  An exacerbation or worsening of a chronic condition should be recorded as an AE.  
Both serious and non -serious AEs should be graded on a three -point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and 
reported in detail on the appropriate AE page of the CRF.   
The suggested definitions are as follows:  
Mild : Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity  
Moderate:  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
Severe:    Incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
Using the following criteria, investigators also need to assess whether there is a reasonable possibility 
that study intervention caused or contributed to the AE. 
19 
 • Yes (possibly or probably)  
There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and study intervention; an d/or 
There is a biologically plausible mechanism for study intervention causing or contributing to the AE; 
and 
The AE may or may not be attributed to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or procedures.  
• No 
A clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the AE and study intervention; 
and/or  
A causal relationship is considered biologically implausible. 
 
5.2           BASELINE MEDICAL CON DITIONS  
It is not necessary to complete an AE CRF page for chronic medical conditions pres ent at enrollment 
that do not worsen in intensity or frequency during the trial.  These medical conditions should be 
adequately documented on the appropriate page of the CRF (medical history and/or physical 
examination).  However, medical conditions present at enrollment that worsen in intensity or frequency 
during the treatment or post -treatment periods and ongoing AEs that started during the previous study 
should be reported and recorded as AEs.   
5.3           PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING AND REPORTING A DVERSE EVENTS  
     5.3.1          Recording Adverse Events  
To improve the quality and precision of acquired AE data, investigators should observe the following 
guidelines:  
• Whenever possible, use recognized medical terms when recording AEs on the AE pages of the CRF.  
Do not use colloquialisms and/or abbreviations. 
• If known, record the diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) rather than component signs and 
symptoms on AE pages of the CRF (e.g., record congestive heart failure rather than dyspnea, rales, and 
cyan osis).  However, signs and symptoms that are considered unrelated to an encountered syndrome or 
20 
 disease should be recorded as individual AEs on the CRF (e.g., if congestive heart failure and severe 
headache are observed at the same time, each events should be recorded as an individual AE).  
• AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_86187].  
A “primary” AE, if clearly identifiable, generally represents the most accurate clinical term to record on 
AE pages of t he CRF.  If a primary serious AE (SAE) is recorded on an SAE CRF, events occurring 
secondary to the primary event should be described in the narrative description of the case.   
 
     5.3.2          Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as SERIOUS  if: 
• It resulted in death (i.e., the AE caused or led to death).  
• It was life threatening (i.e.,  the AE placed the subject at immediate risk of death; it does not 
apply to an AE that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).  
• It required or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the AE required at least a 24 -hour 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86588]/surgical procedures, scheduled trea tments, or routine 
check -ups are not SAEs by [CONTACT_44134]).  
• It was disabling (i.e., the AE resulted in a substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry 
out normal life functions). 
• It resulted in a congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., an adver se outcome in a child or fetus of a 
subject exposed to the molecule or study drug prior to conception or during pregnancy).  
• It does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to  prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Sight -threatening adverse events  
An adverse event is considered to be sight -threatening if it meets one or more of the following criteria 
and will be reported as a serious adverse event (SAE):  
• The event causes a decrease in visual acuity of greater >30 letters ( compared with the last 
assessment of visual acuity prior to the most recent treatment) lasting >1 hour.  
21 
 • The event causes a decrease in visual acuity to the level of light perception or worse lasting >1 
hour. 
• The event requires surgical intervention (e.g, conventional surgery, vitreous tap or biopsy with intravitreal injection of antibiotics, or laser or retinal cryopexy with gas) to prevent permanent loss of sight. 
• The event is associated with severe intraocular inflammation (i.e., 4+ anterior chamber 
cell/flare or 4+ vitritis).  
• In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the event may require medical intervention to prevent 
permanent loss of sight.

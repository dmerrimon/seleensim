Statistical Analysis Plan , 25 July 2018  Page 4 of 78 1. INTRODUCTION 
The following statistical analysis plan  (SAP)  provides the framework for the 
summarization of the data from this study. The SAP  may change due to unforeseen 
circumstances. Any changes made from the planned analysis within protocol, after 
the unblinding, or  locking of the database will be documented in the clinical study 
report  (CSR) . The section referred to as Table Shells within this SAP describes the 
traceability of the tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) back to the data. N ote that the 
header for this page will be the one used for the main body of the CSR.  
Any additional exploratory analyses not  addressed within this SAP  and/or driven by 
[CONTACT_26739], or requested by [CONTACT_214078], Inc., will be considered out of scope and must be 
described in the CSR.  
2. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1 Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single 
intravenous ( IV) bolus doses of E -WE thrombin when administered to healthy adult 
subjects.  
The secondary objective  is to assess the pharmacodynamics  (PD) of single IV bolus 
doses of E -WE thrombin when administered to healthy adult subjects. The activated 
protein C/protein C inhibitor complex (APC -PCI) will be used as a surrogate 
biomarker for drug exposure.  
2.2 Endpoints  
The primary endpoi nts of the study will be the number and severity of treatment-
emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) following single IV bolus doses of E -WE thrombin 
and placebo. In addition, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), clinical laboratory tests (including coagulation), thrombin time, immunogenicity, and injection site reaction will be assessed throughout the study. 
The secondary endpoints  are the PD (i.e., APC -PCI) of E -WE thrombin following 
single IV bolus doses. PD will act as a surrogate for  pharmacokinetics ( PK) of E -WE 
thrombin. 
3. STUDY DESIGN  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) 
study conducted at one study center in the [LOCATION_002] (US).  Four (4) cohorts of either 6 subjects (Cohort 1 [[ADDRESS_800012] ive and 2 placebo]) or 5 subjects 
(Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 [4 active and 1 placebo]) are planned for evaluation.  
Aronora, Inc.  
E-WE thrombin, Protocol Number  CA19169 
Celerion, Clinical Study Report No. C A19169 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan , 25 July 2018  Page 5 of 78 In each cohort, subjects will receive a single IV bolus of E -WE thrombin or placebo. 
Subjects will participate in only 1 cohort. 
Cohort 1 will contain a sentinel group of 2 subjects (1 placebo and 1 active) who will 
be dosed at least [ADDRESS_800013] 14 days (2 subjects in each group [Cohort 1] or 
[ADDRESS_800014] group and 3 subjects in the second group [Cohorts 2- 4]). The 
placebo will be randomized to one of the  groups .  
Dose escalation to the next dose level (i.e., next cohort) will not take place until after the Principal Investigator (PI) has reviewed the safety data. If any findings in the safety data are of concern, then the Safety Review Committee (SRC) comprised of but not limited to, the Sponsor, medical monitor, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_604185]. Data from all subjects in the cohort will be used and reviewed for a dose escalation decision and a minimum of  [ADDRESS_800015] 
complete the study (up to Day 14) before proceeding to the next higher dosing cohort.  
Subjects will participate in only one cohort. An attempt will be made to have at least 30% of the total subjects of a race/ethnicity minority group. An a ttempt will be made 
to include at least 2  females per cohort.  
Safety (i.e., physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests [including coagulation], thrombin time, immunogenicity, injection site reaction, and AEs) will be assessed throughout the study.  
Blood samples will be collected for PD asses sment  (i.e., APC -PCI) of E -WE 
thrombin.  
Blood samples will be also collected for the ADA evaluation . 
Subjects will be housed on Day - 1, at the time indicated by [CONTACT_326646] 
(CRU ), until after the 24- hour blood draw and/or study procedures. At all times, a 
subject may be required to remain at the CRU for longer at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_126985].  
Subjects (including those who terminate early) will return on Days 14 and 28 for follow -up (FU) procedures (coagulation sample collection, thrombin time 
measurement, and immunogenicity sample collection) and to determine if any AE has occurred since the last study visit). Subjects who terminate the study early will be asked to continue aPTT and thrombin time monitoring as scheduled until Day 28. 
Any subjects for whom aPTT and/or thrombin time did not reach ±  10% of the 
baseline value or within the normal range by [CONTACT_2006] 14, will return every 7 days 
(±2 days) until aPTT and thrombin time reach ±10% of the baseline value or within

Day 28 will be repeated) 7 days (± 2 days) after it was reached.  
The total planned duration of subject participation is approximately [ADDRESS_800016] FU . 
4. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
4.1 Analysis Populations  
Safety population:   All subjects who received the study drug (active or placebo) will 
be included in the safety summary. 
PD population:   All subjects receiving the study drug (active or placebo) and having 
any measurable PD  data will be included in the PD data set. The Sponsor will assess 
the real time aPTT on -site. The  protein C  samples will be processed by [CONTACT_604202] .  
4.2 Preliminary  Data and Interim Analysis  
If there ar e safety concerns, all available blinded safety /tolerability  data (i.e., physical 
examinations, ECGs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests [including coagulation], 
thrombin time, injection site reaction, and AEs available for all subjects who have comple ted up to Day 14 procedures) will be reviewed by [CONTACT_604203].  
At the Sponsor’s request, unblinded safety tables, figures, and data listings may be presented to the sponsor’s medical expert [INVESTIGATOR_604219] 2 studies prior to database lock. These interim analyses 
will be performed on data that will be edit- checked and monitored. 
A safety programmer and a biostatistician at Celerion who are not involved with the present study will  be unblinded to prepare the required unblinded safety tables, 
figures, and data listings. All the personnel related to the present study will remain blinded.

Statistical Analysis Plan , 25 July 2018  Page 10 of 78 emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be summarized. Any non- drug procedure performed due 
to an AE will be listed by  [CONTACT_1130].  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that is starting or worsening at the time of or after the 
study drug dose administration. If an AE increases in severity, that AE will be given a resolution date and time and a new record will be initiated with the new severity. If the severity of an AE remains the same or decreases, the AE will be kept open through to resolution and the maximum severity will be recorded. If the onset time of an AE is missing and the onset date is the same as the treatment dosing date  or does 
not fall on a dosing date , the AE will be considered treatment -emergent. If the onset 
date of an AE is missing, then the AE will be considered treatment -emergent. 
TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term. Summary tables will include number of subjects reporting the TEAE and corresponding percentage by [CONTACT_15994], pooled placebo, and overall the study. The number of TEAEs will be summarized in a similar way. Percentages will be based on the total number of subjects dosed or total number of TEAEs, respectively, for each dose level, pooled placebo, or overall the study, as appropriate. In addition, the number of TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_11762]. 
If present, serious adverse events (SAEs) will  be listed, displayed in a table, and a 
narrative included in the study CSR.

To distinguish the PI [INVESTIGATOR_604188], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_604187] “N” and “Y” will be  presented as “- “ and “+” in the data listing, respectively.  
In addition, a derived flag (a 4
th flag) based on a search of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_604189] a 
comment of “CS” or “Clinically Significant” will be used. The derived flag will be populated with “+” if the positive clinically significant determination is found in the comments for cases when the PI [INVESTIGATOR_604190] a “^” or a “R”.  
Out-of-range values and corresponding recheck results will be listed. Out -of-range 
values are considered to be values that are out -of- normal range as defined by [CONTACT_539780]. Results that are indicated as CS by [CONTACT_978] (either in the PI [INVESTIGATOR_604191]) will be also listed in a separate table.  
For all safety values that are numeric, descriptive statistics will be presented for each laboratory test by [CONTACT_15994], pooled placebo, and time point. Change from baseline 
will be summarized in a similar way. In addition, for the a ctivated partial 
thromboplastin t ime (aPTT) (coagulation test), the fold c hange from baseli ne will be 
calculated and summarized in a similar way. The following formula will be used  for 
the calculation : postdose/baseline. Baseline is defined as the result closest and prior to 
the dose on Day 1 (i.e., Day [ADDRESS_800023] of tests) which 
may include unscheduled or recheck results, whichever is later. Postdose unscheduled events or rechecks will not be included in summaries. Similarly early termination results will not be included in summaries.
